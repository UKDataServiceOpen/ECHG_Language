The most dangerous Salut, Barcelona, Catalonia, SPAIN. DNA-lesion caused by IR is considered to be the double-strand break (DSB) and indeed, NBS patient cells are sensitive to all mutagens which produce DSBs directly or indirectly . The underlying gene, NBN, codes for a protein, nibrin, involved on the one hand, as a “caretaker”, in the processing/repair of DNA double strand breaks and on the other hand, as a “gatekeeper”, in the regula- tion of cell cycle checkpoints . The majority of patients are homozygous for a founder mutation in NBN, a 5bp deletion in exon 6 . This muta- tion leads to a truncated amino-terminal fragment containing FHA and BRCT domains, and a carboxy-terminal protein (p70-nibrin) which is produced by alternative initiation of translation from a cryptic upstream start . NBN is an essential gene and it is clear that the carboxyterminal p70-nibrin protein is sufficient to ensure patient survival. We have been examining patient cells and conditional Nbn null mutant mouse cells in order to establish which functions of full length nibrin can be carried out by the carboxy terminal fragment and, more par- ticularly, how this partial functioning explains aspects of the human disease . In this connection a further rare nibrin fragment, p80-nibrin, which is associated with a milder course of the disease has been of particular interest since it may define the basis of a potential anti-can- cer prophylactic treatment for NBS patients . s15.1 Genomic Perspectives on Human Origins S.

Mutations causing peripheral neuropathies show intra- and interfamilial variability. In presented family MNCVs are severely reduced, except for the only male patient, whose MNCV is 35.7 m/s and could fit even in a group of axonal neuropathies. There is no extensive intrafamilial variability in this family, but, the only male patient displays milder symptoms then other, female patients. Although, there were no previously reported association between MPZ gene muta- tions, sex and the severity of the disease, cases like this should be recognized in order to remind us that our knowledge of biology of myelin sheet and peripheral nervous system is limited and, probably, more complex then we assume.Clinical genetics 

We carried out meiotic studies in spermatocytes M. Hoogenboom, C. Knepflé, K. Madan; to establish the base line level of meiotic abnormalities in fertile males . Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Testicular biopsies were obtained from We report a case with an unusual pseudo-dicentric Y chromosome with 11 fertile males aged 30-47 . Meiotic spreads were prepared by the air- three short arm segments. When the male patient was first referred for drying technique and cells were stained with DAPI . RESULTS: Meiotic karyotyping because of hypogonadism and mental retardation more progression was analysed at pachytene, metaphase I and metaphase than 30 years ago, he was found to have a mosaic karyotype with two II stages, counting 1,000 pachytene spermatocytes per individual . All cell lines, one 45,X and the other with an abnormal non-fluorescent Y males showed a normal meiotic progression, with a proportion of meta- chromosome . The father had a normal Y chromosome . At the age of phase II to metaphase I higher than 0 .5 . A total of 848 spermatocytes 47, the patient was referred again for cytogenetic analysis because at metaphase I was studied . The overall percentage of dissociated sex of his mental retardation . Mutation analysis in connection with thyroid chromosomes was 21 .7% . Autosomal synaptic abnormalities were dysfunction revealed a thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRb) germline found in 0 .9% of spermatocytes I (medium-sized bivalents with one mutation .
