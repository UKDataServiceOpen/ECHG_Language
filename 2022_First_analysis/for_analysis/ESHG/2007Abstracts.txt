Many recombina- tion sites were located in close vicinity to each other and to the cen- tromeres. Average distance between neighbouring sites was 22% SC length, while in humans and other mammals studied it usually exceeds 50-60%. For the chromosomes of comparable size the shape param- eter in the cats was equal to 4.1 while in mice and shrews was about 14-18, , i.e. as much as one quarter of the precursors were converted into crossover sites in the cats against only 5-7% in other mammals.Cytogenetics 11 Brain Autosomes Sex chromosomes 7q3 chromosome region.
