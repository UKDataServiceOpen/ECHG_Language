We homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations affect approximately further expand our analysis to include a worldwide dataset of over 60 1/5,000 individuals. The mutation level of transmitted heteroplasmic STRs which differ in their molecular attributes. This analysis shows mtDNA point mutations varies significantly between embryos due to a that by taking into account the intrinsic molecular characteristics of segregational bottleneck. Prenatal (PND) or pre-implantation genetic Y chromosome STRs, one can arrive at a more reliable estimate for diagnosis (PGD) of mtDNA disorders is complicated by the inability the age of Y chromosome lineages. Subsequently, we suggest that to accurately predict the threshold of clinical expression for most most STR-based Y chromosome dates are likely to be underestimates heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations. Here we tried to define a minimal due to the molecular characteristics of the markers commonly used, mutant level below which the chance for an embryo of being affected such as their mutation rate and the range of potential alleles that is acceptably low, irrespective of the exact mtDNA point mutation. A STR can take, which potentially leads to a loss of time-linearity. As a systematic review was performed on muscle mutant levels of 159 consequence, we update the STR-based age of important nodes in different heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutations derived from 327 the Y chromosome tree, showing that credible estimates for the age of unrelated patients or pedigrees, excluding three overrepresented lineages can be made once these STR characteristics are taken into mtDNA mutations. We generated a distribution of mutation levels of consideration. Finally we show that the STRs that are most commonly all affected individuals (n=195) and their unaffected maternal relatives used to explore deep ancestry are not able to uncover ancient (n=19) from 137 pedigrees with a familial mtDNA mutation, and relationships, and we propose a set of STRs that should be used in predicted the risk of being affected given a varying mutant level.

The AChR is more insight into the pathogenic contribution of the identified CNVs, composed of five subunits; two alpha, one beta and one delta subunit we reviewed the literature, searched in databases for similar CNVs are invariably present. The gamma subunit (CHRNG gene) is present in patients and studied the function of the genes located within the before the 33rd wk of gestation in humans but is replaced by a subunit CNVs. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with CNVs in the late fetal and perinatal period, thereby forming the adult AChR. and patients without CNVs mAtERiALs AND mEtHODs: Proband case was a four year old Results: We detected seven CNVs in four of the thirteen patients with male.

Introduction: Oculoauriculo vertebral spectrum or OAVS (OMIM Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a heterogeneous 164210) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous congenital condition results from a defect of blastogenesis involving abnormal disorder involving developmental defects of first and second branchial development of facial structures derived from the first and second arch derivatives. Main features are unilateral/bilateral ear anomalies branchial arches with in same cases cardiac, vertebral and CNS (anotia, microtia, preauricular tags, pits), hemifacial microsomia, ocular defects. defects and vertebral malformations. Other features are cleft lip and/or We describe three uncommon newborns’ case with OAVS. First is a palate, cardiac, cerebral , renal malformations and mental retardation. male with OAVS and severe caudal regression: the clinical features Diverse chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with OAVS were marked right hemifacial microsomia, hypoplasia of the right (trisomies/monosomies). mandibular ramus and right external ear with atresic external auditory Clinical Report: We report a 31 year old patient, with clinical diagnosis canal and ossicles agenesia; “frog-like” appearance of the lower of Treacher Collins syndrome and several affected family members extremities, flexed knees due to bilateral popliteal pterigium and suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. Normal pregnancy equinovarus deformity of bilateral feet. Abdomen US showed crossed and delivery. No gestational diabetes, uterine malformations, toxic renal ectopia, lower spine X-rays revealed absence of vertebra below environment.

BPES is a genetic disorder which generally displays an increased chromosome 7-, 14- and X-specific aneuploidy. CIN more autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The purpose of this study severely affects the cerebellum than the cerebrum. Paradoxically, is to identify chromosomal abnormalities in patients with congenital AT patients’ longevity has positively correlated with CIN rates in BPES. It has been shown that penetrance is 100% in type I when the cerebellum. To solve this paradox we propose two alternative the transmission is by males only and 96.5% in type II in which hypotheses: (1) overproduction of immature neural cells with transmission occurs through both sexes. In this study 20 sporadic unrealized chromosome breaks and aneuploidy takes place exclusively and 3 familial cases of congenital BPES were enrolled for cytogenetic during early brain development, and chromosomally aberrant cells analysis. In all familial cases pedigree showed autosomal dominant might be resistant to apoptotic clearance throughout ontogeny and, pattern of inheritance.

The frequency of the Turner’s syndrome is about 1 in role in the pathophysiology of COPD. Telomere length has been 5000 live female births. The most frequent chromosome constitution in observed to be inversely associated with increased oxidative stress Turner’s syndrome is 45,X. However, about 50 percent of cases have and inflammation. Since chronic oxidative stress plays a major role in other karyorypes. About 25 percent of cases reveal mosaic karyotypes, COPD, telomere length is hypothesized to reduce at a faster rate in in which only a proportion of cells show 45.X. The chromosome COPD. The first aim of this study was to investigate telomere length constitution is clinically significant, and different cases show rather in COPD patients in relation to oxidative stress and inflammation.

Our study showed a good correlation between We report 2 cases of mosaic ring chromosome 13. For the first patient, the MLPA and CC results (Table I), discrepancies were found in 7 a male with a karyotype: 46, XY,r(13)[40]/45,XY, -13 [10]. He presented samples (18.5%).

Material and The frequency of Down’s syndrome in the most populations is around methods: The present study was performed in 266 couples with RD: one in 700-800 live births and shows different karyotypes. Trisomy 21 is 80 (30,07%) with primary sterility (ST), 149 (56,01%) with Recurrent the main cause of approximately 95% of observed Down’s syndrome, Spontaneous Abortions (RSA) and 37 (13,90%) with Stillborn Children with 88% coming from nondisjunction in the matenal gamete and 7% (SC). A GTG-banded karyotype was performed on both parteners of coming from nondisjunction in the paternal gamete. Robertsonian each couple. Results: We identified a chromosomal abnormality in 43 translocation and isochromosome of the long arm of chromosome 21 individuals (16,16%): 20 cases (7,51%) with ST, 13 cases (4,88%) with are the cause of 2-3% of observed cases of Down’s syndrome. It does RSA and 10 cases (3,75%) with SC. The affected partner was female not show the maternal age effect, and is just as likely to have come in 23 cases (8,64%) and male in 20 cases (7,51%). A X chromosome from fatherts as mothers. The remaining 1-2% are mosaicism.In about (numerical or structural) abnormality was detected in 18 cases three-fourths of translocation Down’s syndrome, neither parent is a (6,76%), most frequent X chromosome monosomy mosaicism in carrier, and a mutation in the germ cells of one parent has caused the female and trisomy XXY in male; a balanced structural chromosomal translocation. The causes of these mutations are unknown. abnormality (BSC) was detected in 23 couples (8,64%); in other two We report five infants (three boys and two girls) from the five different males with ST, the karyotype result was 46,XX. Conclusions: The families, all revealed typical clinical features of the Down’s syndrome. results of our study are similar to other reported studies and underline The parental age of the five cases were between 20-30 years old. the major etiologic role of chromosomal abnormalities in RD and the Cytogenetic study were carried out, using the standard banding importance of chromosomal analysis for the etiologic diagnosis and techniques, for the cases and their parents. The karyotypes of the three genetic counselling of these patients. cases were: 46,XY,der(21;21)(q10;q10),+21 and the other two cases showed: 46,XX,der(14;21)(q10;q10),+21.

Background: Hydatidiform mole (HM), represents a disorder of The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that infertile genomic imprinting, a phenomenon whereby genes are monoallelically men, having oligoasthenozoospermia present a higher grade of expressed from the maternally or paternally-derived copy of the gene. chromosomal aneuploidies than men with normal fertility. FISH HM are classified as partial (PHM) or complete (CHM). The aim of technique allows the study of a significant number of spermatozoa this study was to analyze and to compare the methylation patterns of in a relatively short period. This is very important for the correct imprinted genes in CHM and PHM. evaluation of the patients with oligoasthenozoospermia, knowing that material and methods: We used methylation-sensitive high- the frequency of chromosomal anomalies in spermatozoa of infertile resolution melting technique (MS-HRM) for the methylation analysis of men is 10 times bigger than in men with normal fertility. In this study three paternally expressed genes, SNRPN, KCNQ1OT1 and GNAS- we included 15 men with oligoasthenozoospermia and a control XLaS, that are normally only methylated on the maternal allele, and a lot of donors for whom at least 1000 spermatozoa were evaluated. maternally expressed gene, H19, which is normally only methylated on Sperm count revealed a number varing betwen 3x103 and 3x106 and the paternal allele. DNA samples including 25 CHM and 20 PHM were 50-80% of the spermatozoa were imobile. All the patients inluded in scored as hypermethylated, normal, or hypomethylated. this study had normal constitutional karyotype. We performed FISH Results: We found loss of cytosine methylation in 19 CHM and 1 PHM technique using Abbott Vysis 13, 18, 21, X and Y chromosomes at SNRPN DMRs, 20 CHM and 1 PHM at KCNQ1OT1 DMRs, and in probes following the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer 24 CHM and 3 PHM at GNAS-XlaS DMRs. Hypermethylation at H19 with slight modifications. We assessed the chromosomes that DMRs was showed in 21 CHM and 1 PHM. Abnormal DNA methylation have most frecquently major clinically signifiance in children with patterns at all imprinted genes were highly correlated to CHM than aneuploidies. The aneuploidies rate of the studied chromosomes in PHM (p<0.05). our oligoasthenozoospermic patients spermatozoa was 13.61%, the conclusion: Our data confirm that abnormal methylation status higher incidence was recorded for gonosomes followed by disomy of imprinted genes is significantly associated to androgenic CHM of chromosomes 13, 21, 18. Our results show an increase frequency characterized by diffuse trophoblastic hyperplasia and the lack of foetal of sperm chromosome abnormalities in infertile patients compared development. So, we confirm the correlation between phenotypic with control donors. Patients with normal karyotype, low sperm variability of different forms of HM and various degrees of disorder of concentration and reduced spermatozoa motility have an increased imprinting. MS-HRM analysis is a rapid, specific and sensitive method, risk of producing spermatozoa with chromosomal number aberrations, which can be applied for the accurate differentiation between CHM particularly for the sex chromosomes. and PHM.

The reliability of diagnosis available in Japan. depends on the number, heterozygosity and informativity of such Of the 74 patients, seven were born after ART (six after ICSI and one markers. When database search yields insufficient results, it is after IVF). Molecular studies revealed underlying genetic causes in essential to discover novel markers. all patients, including the seven patients born after ART of whom two Aim: To describe a simple approach for detecting novel locus-specific had deletion of the paternally derived 15q imprinted region and five polymorphic markers. had trisomy rescue type upd(15)mat (TR-upd(15)mat). The maternal Material and Methods: To detect CA-repeats, we copy the sequence of ages at birth were increased in PWS patients conceived after ART interest spanning 1 Mb upstream and downstream from the mutation (36-45 years), especially in those with TR-upd(15)mat (38-45 years), site into a MS Word file. Then we search this sequence using the Ctrl-F consistent with the notion that the advanced maternal age is a risk function for (CA)n or (TG)n, (where n>10). Such STRs will often be factor for the development of TR-upd(15)mat. polymorphic. Primers are then designed for each site. A marker is The frequency of births after ART was significantly higher in PWS considered informative when the CA repeat size is different among the patients than in the general population (P=2.2×10-9), even after various alleles in family members. adjusting maternal ages (≥35 years) (P=5.4×10-6). Among PWS Results: Over the last 8 years we performed PGD for 65 different patients, however, although the relative frequency of TR-upd(15) disease genes, using 545 flanking polymorphic markers. Of these, mat was significantly higher in patients conceived after ART than in 344 (63.1%) were obtained using published data. However, for more those conceived naturally (P =0.008), it became non-significant after than 20 disease genes, with insufficient informative markers, we were adjusting maternal ages (≥35 years) between the two groups (P=0.22). able to detect an additional 201 (36.9%) novel CA-repeats using The results imply that ART and/or ART-related parental and this approach.

Results: During a period of 11 years 312 PGD cycles were performed In total, 73 Estonian samples (43 RM patients and 30 fertile) were for 69 male and 73 female carriers of RecT. The mean female age analyzed on Illumina Infinum genome-wide genotyping platform. In was 32.8years, the mean male age 35.8 years. Most carriers were order to predict the presence of a CNV, two algorithms (PennCNV diagnosed with a translocation because of fertility problems or and QuantiSNP) were used in parallel to analyze the genome-wide recurrent miscarriages and most of them opted for PGD to avoid these data.

Two of these CNVs cover loci, low success rate when expressed per cycle with oocyte pick-up. which have been previously shown to function in the establishment Once embryo transfer was feasible, the live birth delivery rate was of a successful pregnancy - regulation of trophoblast invasiveness or similar to that of PGD in general at our centre. immunological response. In order to confirm the impact of the identified PGD is therefore an established option for specific RecT carriers and CNVs in susceptibility to recurrent pregnancy loss, experiments for the its availability should be discussed during reproductive counseling. replication of these initial findings in other populations are ongoing.

Therefore we investigated the association of this epigenetic BRCA2 gene expression in samples of ovarian cancer, in tumour event in different molecular subtypes of breast tumors. Although microenvironment and in distant from tumour regions were breast cancer subtypes were originally identified by gene expression investigated. In accordance with ESRα and OSTP role in cancer analysis using DNA microarrays, large-scale sub typing using gene development, their expression in tumor relatively normal ovarian expression profiling from formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded samples tissue was increased in 35-40% of cases. Important, that in tumour is not currently feasible. According to recent approaches about microenvironment these genes were activated higher than in tumor immunohistochemical (IHC) based classification of breast tumors to in 25-30% of cases, sometimes even if the expression in tumor was molecular subtypes, we used IHC surrogates to identify breast tumor near to normal. Possibly this reflects the postulated effect of tumor intrinsic subtypes in 91 breast tumors in Iranian patients. ER-/PR-/ instigation by microenvironment and should be taken into account in Her2- tumors were classified as triple negative (basal like) (25%), ER-/ practical diagnostics, especially ESR. The BRCA1 role in ESRα and PR-/her2+ tumors as her2+ group(24%), ER+/PR+/Her2- as luminal OSTP regulation as it was observed for breast cancer was not found A (34%) and ER+/PR+/Her2+ as luminal B tumors(17%). Methylation for ovarian cancer in our work. However we revealed a correlation of status of estrogen receptor promoter was investigated in these BRCA2 gene expression with both ESRα and OSTP expression in subtypes. There was a significant correlation between methylation in ovarian cancer tumor. In this aspect it is interesting inverse correlation ERα and triple negative subtype where 20/23 (86.7%) of them were of relations of expression levels in tumor and microenvironment for methylated. Also significant correlation were found in Her2+ subtype BRCA1 and BRCA2 revealed by us. The data for the first time highlight tumors with 20/22 (90.9%) methylation in ERα (P<0.002). These two the functional interrelation of important for tumor development genes non-luminal subtypes have poor prognosis and it has shown that they in the ovarian tumor and its microenvironment. are associated with significant decrease in survival.

Induction of heat shock response is accompanied by elevated Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed transcription of Heat Shock Proteins, which are controlled by HSF1. cancer and one of the major causes of death in men. An understanding Under normal conditions HSF1 appears as a repressed monomer of factors associated with PCa mortality is increasingly important. shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus. Upon stress HSF1 Accumulating evidence implicates inflammation in PCa. Genetic becomes activated which is associated with trimerization, nuclear variations within the sequence of candidate inflammatory genes like accumulation, hyperphosphorylation, acquisition of DNA-binding and TLRs 2, 3, 9 and COX-2 genes may lead to suboptimal inflammatory transactivation capacity. HSF1 protects cells from various stresses capacity and therefore increased PCa risk. and increases cellular viability. It can also promote tumor survival as material and methods: We genotyped 195 PCa and 250 healthy cancer cells depleted in HSF1 show significantly reduced growth and controls for TLR2 (−196 to −174 Del), TLR3 (c.1377C/T) [rs3775290], survival.

Tumors associated with Lynch syndrome are characterized Tumor-based diagnostic techniques are currently the first diagnostic by microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of expression of one or step for Lynch syndrome (LS). However, these techniques are more MMR proteins. In a considerable number of patients with tumors expensive, time-consuming and have low specificity. that fulfill these criteria a germline mutation cannot be identified. Our aim was to evaluate the current diagnosis of LS and to investigate To elucidate the cause of the MMR-deficiency in these tumors, we the role of clinically-based mutation probability methods (MMR-pro, analyzed whether somatic mutations in the suspected MMR gene Wijnen) to optimize it. We included 229 consecutive patients, counseled could explain the phenotype. between 2000 and 2008, who fulfilled the revised Bethesda criteria Methods - In total 13 unexplained MLH1-deficient tumors and 9 and underwent further diagnosis of LS. From them, 67 (29%) had an unexplained MSH2-deficient tumors were screened for somatic MSI tumor, 39 of them (17%) was due to LS.

All three patients fulfilled the Amsterdam II (AMS II) Conclusion - In 10 tumors, especially those that are MLH1-deficient, criteria compared to only one in the non-LS group. we could only identify one mutation, suggesting the presence of an as Based on these results a diagnostic flowchart was designed, as yet unidentified second mutation in either the tumor or the germline. In follows: MSI is not performed if MMR-Pro scores <0.20 (except for the 32% of cases with two tumor-specific mutations in MLH1 or MSH2 cases that are AMS II positive) or >0.90. In the high score group the presence of an additional germline MMR gene mutation is unlikely, detection of the four MMR proteins and/or direct DNA-sequencing of thereby reducing their familial risk for Lynch syndrome-related tumors the MMR-genes can be performed. This approach was validated in considerably. 67 additional patients: 49% could be excluded from tumor analysis without missing any LS.  P06

The different potential pathways for bladder cancer screenings may be deleterious by affecting RNA splicing. We have tumorigenesis have been shown in various studies. Many biomarkers added to our molecular diagnostic procedure a functional minigene have been used for the diagnosis, surveillance, and management of assay that assesses the impact on splicing of VUS identified in the bladder cancer. Here, we used methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase MLH1 and MSH2 genes, involved in the Lynch syndrome. The assay (MTHFR) biomarkers. MTHFR enzyme plays a keyrole in the folate relies on the use of patient genomic DNA, which is always available metabolism which is present in many bio-chemical pathways such as in the molecular diagnostic laboratory. We have so far tested a total of homocysteine methylation and nucleotide bio-synthesis. The purposeCancer genetics 224 of this study is to examine relationship between MTHFR gene (677 for MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer patients than for C→T and 1298 A→C polymorphisms) and bladder cancer in Turkey. For control patients (hazard ratio of death = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.72). this purpose, regions where polymorphisms are located were amplified conclusions: In a European study cohort, we found statistically with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method.

Background: MUTYH-associated polyposis is a recessively inherited Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by a lifetime risk of colorectal cancer that is disorders with an increased production of terminally differentiated up to 100%. Because specific histological and molecular genetic cells. The disease course of MPN is generally chronic, however a features of MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancers might proportion of the patients show disease progression to secondary influence tumor behavior and patient survival, we compared survival myelofibrosis, accelerated phase and/or secondary acute myeloid between patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer leukemia, associated with a poor prognosis. We investigated and matched control patients with colorectal cancer from the general chromosomal aberrations in 408 MPN patients using high-resolution population. SNP microarrays to identify disease-associated somatic lesions. Of methods: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study from Europe, the 408 patients 37.5% had a wild type karyotype and 62.5% harbored 147 patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer were between one and fifteen chromosomal aberrations. We identified 25 compared with 272 population-based control patients with colorectal chromosomal regions that were recurrently affected (in at least three cancer who were matched for country, age at diagnosis, year of patients). In 6 of these 25 regions, the aberrations mapped single diagnosis, stage, and subsite of colorectal cancer. Kaplan-Meier target genes including FOX P1

Screening of more than 7000 German breast and ovarian cancer We analyzed genomic imbalances affecting chromosome 8 by array- families by PCR based techniques revealed that in high risk groups, CGH in 28 primary ovarian cancers and 9 ovarian cancer cell lines, mutation frequencies in the two known BRCA genes reach between 20- using a home made BAC-array covering this chromosome at a mean 50%. In contrast, mutations in other predisposing genes like CHEK2 density of 1 BAC clone/0.8 Mb. We identified regions of highly frequent and ATM were detected with very low prevalence. As still a significant gains or losses, since they affected more than 40% of ovarian cancers proportion of our families are lacking mutations in these known genes, and determined sites showing alterations of elevated amplitude we decided to screen them for mutations in another recently detected (amplifications or homozygous deletions). Doing this we also identified predisposing gene for breast cancer, called PALB2/FANCN. at least two adjacent changed clones. Finally, we characterized the Using direct sequencing, dHPLC- and/or HRM-based technologies, smallest regions of overlap for gains. This allowed us to determine we performed a comprehensive mutation analysis of the entire PALB2 anomalies strongly associated to the disease such as: deletions at gene in 818 familial cases of breast cancer from Germany.

A change in the human was activated in 50% of cases but never all three genes investigated ACE gene occurs by an insertion (I) or a deletion (D) of a 287-bp Alu- (VEGF121, VEGF165, PDGFR ) simultaneously. All but one of PTEN repetitive sequence in intron 16, leading to a change in the plasma ACE decreasing cases (40%) were accompanied by PI3K and mTOR level. We investigated the association of ACE gene polymorphisms expression increasing. The mTOR expression was increased in 73% and prostate cancer risk. of cases. All activated HER2 cases (27%) coincided with increased materials and methods: DNA was extracted from 66 samples from mTOR. Likewise, EGFR was co-activated with PI3K and mTOR. It is individuals with a prostate cancer diagnosis and 80 samples from interesting that increased PTEN expression coincided with increased individuals with a benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis. The ACE I/D mTOR but not with PI3K (increased in 50% of cases). Possibly, the genotypes were determined by PCR- RFLP analysis. mTOR may be activated in these cases by another way than through Results& conclusion: The comparative analysis of the two groups PI3K/AKT. revealed no significant differences for any of the ACE genotypes. No In summary, we shown simultaneouse activation a number of genes association between variant genotypes and risk of developing prostate important for prostate cancer development. For this reason targeted cancer was observed with the ACE variant genotype , but it looks that monotherapy may not be effective and combined therapy aimed at further samples is needed to produce more significant results. several genes are required.

Despite many works examining the individual gene methylation Here we present our observations predominantly made on blood and in various malignancies, the question about the specificity of the bone marrow cells which match to the scheme of maternal and paternal methylation profiles of the large groups of genes in the carcinogenesis chromosomes forming two different groups, both in interphase and dynamics remains open. This study was aimed to assess the DNA metaphase. Cytologic findings about the centrioles in relation to their methylation profile in tissues with benign breast disorders (BBD), ploidy status and this order of chromosomes in two groups suggest a breast cancer (BC) and lymph nodes metastasis (LNM).

Leukemia is a malignant disease characterized with uncontrolled Using this approach, we have identified several novel rearrangements proliferation by loosing the ability to differentiate of hemotopoietik that could reflect useful molecular markers involved with the cells. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occurs with the abnormal development of bladder cancer. They can be important in improving uncontrolled and excessive proliferation of lymphoblast. ALL is prognostic on tumor diagnosis, and to develop new therapeutic responsible for approximately 80% of childhood leukemia and approaches. approximately 20% of adult leukemia. Many numerical and structural abnormalities play an important role in the risk assessment and the J07.01 diagnosis of ALL. Numerical anomalies are in the form of chromosomal investigation of FANCA mutations and their effects on the losses and gains. Losses and gains of some chromosomes are more expression of FANCA in iranian patients with Fanconi anemia common than the other chromosomes. In current study, numerical A. Saffar Moghadam, F.

Chromosomal breakage analysis with MMC was performed to establish diagnosis of FA in 40 Iranian patients. RNA was extracted from the blood and consequently cDNA was synthesized. The cDNA of each patient amplified with 22 set PCR reaction. The size of the amplicons were between 200 and 250 bp. Each PCR product screened with SSCP (Single Strand Conformational Polymorphism) and HRM (High Resolution Temperature Melting Curve) for mutation detection. The aberrant SSCP band or HRM was sent for direct sequencing. In this presentation we will demonstrate our data regarding FANCA mutation frequency among Iranian FA patients.

The estimated heritability was factors. Major risk factors of CAD are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, very high (0.90). To identify genetic variants influencing the levels hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history and obesity. Mutations in ACE of Cripto, we performed both linkage and genome-wide association gene can also cause CAD. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate analyses. Through the linkage analysis a strong signal on chromosome the effects of major risk factors and ACE gene polymorphisms on CAD. 3p21.33 was detected (LOD=6.11). This locus exactly corresponds methods: 205 consecutive patients with angiographically proven early to the location of the Cripto gene. This result was supported by the onset CAD and also 140 control subjects with no significant coronary genome-wide association analysis: in fact, several SNPs in this region obstruction angiographically were recruited to the study.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) comprises different subsets based on The non-synonymous R230C variant within the ATP-binding cassette the presence or absence of autoantibodies termed anti-citrullinated transporter A1 gene (ABCA1) has been associated with lower high- peptide antibodies (ACPA). This heterogeneity may reflect important density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in several independent biological differences underlying the disease process. Previous studies. The aim of this project was to analyze whether gender, body genome-wide association studies mainly addressed ACPA positive mass index and dietary factors modulate the effect of R230C on HDL-C RA patients, and consequently detected genetic risk factors primarily levels. The study included 3630 adults (1173 men and 2457 women) associated with ACPA positive disease.

The mechanism by which these SNPs contribute to the issue throughout the world and vaccination of those at risk is the disease pathogenesis and which genes and proteins they affect is not main method of containment. 5-10% of children are not responding yet clear. Using method of linking SNP genotype to the level of gene to hepatitis B vaccines and probably are not adequately protected expression (expression quantitative trait loci - eQTL) we wanted to against the (HBV) infection. We aimed to investigate the genetic explore the feasibility of eQTL analysis for linking non-coding disease polymorphisms of interleukin-1B (IL-1B) and interleukin-1 receptor associated SNPs to genes they regulate. Initially we analyzed locus antagonist gene (IL-1RN) in children not responding to hepatitis B from which non-coding SNP rs3087243 (CTLA4_CT60) showed vaccination, and to determine whether vaccine efficacy is influenced functional relevance and has been associated with the disease. We by these gene polymorphisms. further applied our approach to IBD5 region where SNPs are in high Material and Method: A total of 200 children whose anti-HBs antibody linkage disequilibrium and the main contributor from this region is still levels lower than 10 IU/L after vaccination against hepatitis B unknown. We measured expression of genes from selected regions in according to a standardized schedule were included in this study as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and colon tissue biopsies of 632 non-responder group. One hundred healthy children who had anti-HBs Slovenian IBD patients and in PBL of 312 controls and genotyped all antibody levels higher than 10 IU/L after vaccination against hepatitis B patients and controls for selected SNPs. We showed that non-coding were included as responder group.

Background: Independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) Objective. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease common in the showed an obesogenic effect of two single nucleotide polymorphisms elderly. Our aim was to study single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (SNPs) more than 150 kb downstream of the melanocortin 4 receptor using a genome-wide association (GWA) data in a setting of hand OA gene (M
C4 R). The SNPs might directly influence M

The Alzgene database is a valuable resource for researchers working Whereas the vast majority of DNA sequence-level variation evolves in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the database, the credibility of genetic neutrally and is maintained by a balance between the mutation associations is graded using the interim Venice Criteria but these criteria process and random drift, some parts of the human genome have have never been formally evaluated. We evaluated the robustness of been subjected to natural selection. Admixed populations are unique in the Venice grades in Alzgene data in a simulation studies by adding that they represent the sudden confluence of geographically diverged hypothetical results of simulated studies to the meta-analyses in the genomes with novel environmental challenges. Thus, genomes from top list. We further conducted a follow-up study of the interim grades each ancestral population were presented with new challenges. This of the top list. The Alzgene ‘top list’ changed considerably (40%) over kind of selection pressure may be quite different from that faced by the course of one year. A total of 3 genes with strong credibility were stationary populations, in which the local environmental changes may graded to weak within this short period. When evaluating the question occur gradually, allowing for rare advantageous alleles to increase in whether this is due to a high type 1 error (p-values) or type two error frequency. Admixed populations therefore offer special opportunities (low power), we found that increasing power had very little effect on for studying recent selection. the positive predictive value of a finding, but the impact of testing with a In this study, we propose a method for estimating the ‘age’ of an lower p-value is major.

Here we have high-, low and intermediate MASP-2 producers between patients and sequenced POLG1 gene 5’-promotor region and analyzed distribution controls. of this gene haplotypes in two North Eurasian populations - in Conclusions. In the present analysis, we did not find an association of Russians (n=63) and Buryats (n=90). Only one polymorphic locus, MAS P2

Comparison with our previous haplotypic data has shown that the allelesEvolutionary and population genetics, and Genetic epidemiology 333399 rs2856268-G and -A are strongly associated with haplogroups A and While striking prevalence of Y chromosome haplogroup N1c in B of the POLG1 gene. Interestingly that association of the rs2856268 gene pool differentiates Yakuts from other populations, the mtDNA variants with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in type 1 diabetes mellitus and autosomal analyses demonstrate genetic similarity of all native has been recently reported in Russians (Spitsina et al. 2009). It was populations of Sakha, in particular Yakuts and Evenks. The results also found that the carriers of G-allele and GG-genotype had higher risk demonstrate closest genetic proximity of the populations of Sakha with of DPN development than the carriers of A-allele and AA-genotype. southern Siberians. Both mtDNA and autosomal analyses reveal deep One may suggest that the polymorphism in the 5’-promotor region can genetic discontinuity between Siberian and Beringian populations. differentially modulate expression of the whole POLG1 gene, pointing MtDNA haplogroups A2 and G1b, prevalent in Beringian populations, to a higher possibility for G-allele to determine a lower level both of are either minor or even absent in Sakha, where haplogroups C and D the POLG1 gene expression and the mtDNA repair. In addition, taking dominate. Autosomal analysis also differentiates Beringian populations into account that haplogroups A and B could evolve separately for a from those of Sakha. Our results support the scenario that the territory long time (about 1.5 millions of years), it is important that possibly of Sakha was colonized from the regions west and eastward of Lake more accurate form of enzyme is associated with younger and more Baikal with only minor gene flow from Lower Amur/Southern Okhotsk frequent in humans haplogroup B.
