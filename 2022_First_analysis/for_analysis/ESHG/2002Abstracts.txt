The phenotypic alterations of the proband q and p (excluding the acrocentric chromosomes) and arm-specific are only in part superimposable to those described in the literature for pcp probes. These probes are used after characterizing the sSMC analogous cases. This could be due to the extent of the duplication by cenM-FISH (Nietzel etal., 2001, HumGenet, 108, 199-204). and/or to the monosomy of a portion of q26.

Therefore we divided the DS children into transposition of the great vessels (2.2/10 000). Down syndrome was two groups: born in 1990-1994 and 1995-2000. The first group the most frequent chromosomal aberration (10.7/ 10.000 births). consist 108 patients (birth-rate: 89015). According to these data the CONCLUSIONS: Differences in congenital anomaly rates between incidence of DS was 1:824. In the second group DS was diagnosed different regions of Croatia require further investigation in order to in 85 children (birth-rate: 76767).

We employed to identify the maternal fragile X chromosome which is carried by the bisulphite sequencing technique to detect the methylation status the four children. In the youngest girl, the presence of this maternal of individual CpG sites in the entire promoter region upstream of the fragile X chromosome is inconsistent with the absence of expansion. CGG repeat. Lymphoblastoid cell lines of fragile X males with full So, we discuss the hypothesis of a gene conversion where the mutations of different sizes were tested before and after treatment segregation of flanking markers is dissociated from that of the CGG with 5-azadeoxycytidine at various time points. We observed that expansion. individual clones are either completely demethylated or not, with few relevant exceptions. We also investigated the extent of methylation

Recently, mutations in the OFD1 analysis. gene (Cxorf5) at Xp22 were found to underlie OFD1. We report here Supported by FRAXA Research Fondation, Sigma-Tau and the identification of four novel mutations in the OFD1 gene in the Associazione Anni Verdi.
