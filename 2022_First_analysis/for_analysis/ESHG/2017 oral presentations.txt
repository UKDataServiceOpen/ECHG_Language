However, specifically maternal DNM clusters with inter-mutational distances above 1kb are correlated with maternal age, accounting for a significant proportion of the maternal age effectofallDNMs.Interestingly,theseclustersareenriched onchromosomes8,9and16inknownmaternalaccelerated regions. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the potential mechanisms underlying these events and reveals the sig- nificant contribution of cDNMs to the maternal age effect.78 J.M. Goldmann: None. V.
