The Anew group of high risk pregnancy in the Down screening program has pilot study of the FTS started in 1996, and, by 1999, 35,942 pregnancies been identified in our lab since 1994. Serum markers for Downs syndrome were screened by ultrasound. The age distribution in this group is similar in women subjected to in vitro fertilisation were quite differed from these to the one in the second trimester. The vast majority of pregnancies were ones in common pregnancies. To examine the Downs syndrome (DS) screened between 10th and 13th weeks of gestation. During the pilot screening positive rate among in vitro fertilisation (IVF) pregnancies, we study, 8 types of ultrasound scanners were used, and only two of them measured second trimester serum markers in 60 singleton and in 32 twin proved to be suitable for the FTS. Besides that, 16,000 serum samples IVF pregnancies.
