E-POSTERS Conclusion: Our results are similar to the previous studies which have mostly reported a frequency of less than 10% for Y P01Reproductive Genetics/Prenatal Genetics chromosome microdeletions. The etiology of infertility remains unknown and novel genes other than y chromosome microdele- tionsshould be identified withhighthroughput techniques.

Introduction: Advances in sequencing technology enabled focused explorations on the contribution of rare variants (MAF< 1%)tohumantraits.Rarevariantsinorneargenesdisplaylarger effects on phenotype compared with regulatory and common genetic variants. However, population stratification poses unique challenges in studies of rare variants. Systematic differences in allele frequencies due to ancestry are more pronounced for rare variants. In our study we aimed in NGS (Next generation *GWASsignalsforthers143384andrs224333werereportedfor sequencing) searching for rare /pathogenic variants in genes, European and mixed ancestry populations.
