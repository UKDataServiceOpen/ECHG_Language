Impact of coping style on psychological distress in  women at increased risk of developing breast cancer K. Pieterse1, S. van Dooren2, H. J. Duivenvoorden2, C. Seynaeve2, A. J.  Rijnsburger2, M. M. A. Tilanus-Linthorst2, T. van Elderen1, H. J. de Koning2, A.  Tibben1;  1LUMC, Leiden, Netherlands, 2Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands. Background The MRISC study evaluates the psychological  implications of a regular breast cancer surveillance program for  women at different levels of increased risk of developing breast  cancer. Attending a surveillance program may cause elevated levels  of psychological distress. Coping style can act upon the degree of  reported distress. Objective Impact of coping style on the level and course of general  and breast cancer speciÜc distress will be examined, as well as  differences of this impact between the three risk categories (15-30%,  30-50%, 60-85%). Method Before and after two consecutive surveillance appointments,  participants completed several psychometrically tested  questionnaires. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)  assessed general distress and the Impact of Event Scale (IES)  assessed breast cancer speciÜc distress. Different coping styles were  assessed by the Utrecht Coping List. Statistical analysis The impact of coping style on distress was  analysed by structural equation modeling. The course of distress,  was analysed by piecewise regression modeling. Results 351 Women with a mean age of 40ď years (range 21 - 63)  participated. Of the different coping styles, only the depressive style  substantially affected the levels of general and breast cancer speciÜc  distress (all p-values < 0.01). However, the courses of distress  were unaffected by the depressive coping style. The Ündings will be  visualised. Conclusion The results suggest that particularly the depressive style  of dealing with problems elicits a high level of psychological distress.  This implies that it is of clinical importance to offer professional  support tailored to this way of dealing with problems.\n"
