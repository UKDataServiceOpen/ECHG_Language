      "The unaffected sister is also heterozygote for the deletion.CTNNA3 encodes for the alfaT catenin protein that has a crucial role in cel lular adherence showing suggestive association in GWAS and a de novo de   letion.Even if the frequency of exonic deletions of CTNNA3 is not significantly dif   ferent between ASDs cases and controls (17/2446 cases and 35/5097 con trols, P,.88), no homozygous exonic deletions were found in a sample of  5097 controls, suggesting that only the complete knockout of CTNNA3 could  cause or confer susceptibility for ASDs.\n",

      "Statistically significant opposite transmission  patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression  and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite  alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings.\n",

      "Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment.\n",

      "Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome.\n",
      "Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1).\n",
      "In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment.\n",
      "Conclusion: Autistic individuals with higher genetic burden for the disorder, including large rare CNVs andhigher load of PRS, have different bene ï¬ts of SSGT com  pared with individuals with lower genetic risk.\n",

      "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodeve  lopmental disorders characterized by de ï¬cits in social interaction, communication, and stereotypic behaviors.\n",
      "While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis.\n",
      "Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER.\n",
      "This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore.\n",
      "To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com  pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases.\n",
      "Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) has hindered the establishment of genotype phenotype associations.\n",
      "Herein, we presented a novel approach that integrates semantic similarity andunsupervised machine learning methods to dissect the ASD genotypic heterogeneity and to identify phenotypic mani  festations of ASD genetic variants.\n",
      "This approach wasapplied to copy number variants (N ,6650), disrupting 3998 genes from 1119 ASD patients.\n",
      "The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD.\n",
      "Cluster 1 genes were also most signiï¬cantly enriched for Schizophrenia Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term, which is a co occurring condition with ASD.\n",
      "The other three clusters were not enriched for ASD related HPO terms.\n",
