    "Admittedly, quite a bit of work has already taken place. The .pdf files were sent off to a research support team that scraped the text out of them and stored the contents of those files in .csv files which have useful headers. Each .pdf file was processed to produce a single .csv file. This processing was not universally successful because the original .pdf files were not all encoded in the same format and most had a totally unique layout. In effect, this means that each .pdf to .csv process was not equally able to automatically capture and segment the text in the .pdf into .csv columns such as author, affiliation, session code, etc. This means that some of the .csv files have empty columns while other .csv files have contents written in the same columns. This also means that some of the rows are probably faulty. Obviously, a detailed manual inspection would correct some of these errors but total accuracy is not the point of this research effort. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file for 2004 was particularly tricky and needs separate attention because the output from the research support team was not structured in a way that matches the others very well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we have all the files in a somewhat useful way that allows us to use natural language processing methods to investigate person-first and identity-first language. The next step is to import the various .csv files, consolidate them in one data frame, tidy up some of the erroneous rows and columns and then same the output in a new .csv. \n",

    "All of my jupyter notebooks begin with some code cells focussed on downloading/importing necessary packages, loading useful short names, and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also like to check the relevant file locations before importing the .csv files to work on. "
