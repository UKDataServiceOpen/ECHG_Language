This phase also removes any square brackets, quotes and extra commas introduced by the lemmatisation process. \n",

Do they mean dataset composed from blood tests taken as part of ASD testing? If so, each row in the data set would be a blood test with the possibility that more than one test comes from the same person. Or do they mean a pool of case records, each of which represents a single person? The former would not be \"about people\" but the second would. I did not remove these rows as we cannot be certain. Leaving them out would also have been a valid option, as long as the choice was clear. \n",
