Both of these steps will improve the sentence tokenisation that happens next. \n",

This punctuation, like the capitalisation at the start of the sentences or for the poper nouns, is also retained as it helps the sentence-tokenisation process identify the words within the sentence correctly for their parts of speech (e.g. which of the words are nouns, verbs, etc. ). \n",

    "Following the cleaning and extraction phases, the last phase is consolidation. This phase further refines the data by removing all the rows that do not contain a match for one or both of the patterns. For example, there would be a row for \"The child was tested for autism.\" because it contains a keyword of interest. However, this sentence would be eliminated in the consolidation phase as the keyword does not fit into either the person-first or identity-first patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, this phase goes on to lemmatise the extracted patterns so that they can be counted more easily. This phase also lowercases all occurrences of \"Autistic\", \"Autism\", and \"Asperger's\" as well as removing the apostrophe, the 's' and any non-white characters that might intrude between the 'r' and the 's' of \"Asperger's\". This phase also removes any square brackets, quotes and extra commas introduced by the lemmatisation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "This phase ends by writing out the consolidated data frame to a .csv for manual inspection. I could not find a feasible way of identifying whether or not the nouns matched in the extraction phase are person-nouns or not. As the list is not a totally unreasonable length (in the hundreds) I found it workable to \n",
    "* open in excel, \n",
    "* save the file under another name (e.g. pattern_matches_reviewed), \n",
    "* order the entire data set alphabetically by 'Person-first', \n",

    "* re-order the entire data set alphabetically by 'Identity-first', \n",
    "* scan through the ordered results check whether each result in the 'Identity-first' column is about a person, \n",
    "* removing entire rows if the 'Identity-first' match is not about a person, \n",
    "* save file again. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 'association with autism' matches the person-first pattern but is not about a person, so this row was removed. Many more rows were removed in the 'Identity-first' matches as things like 'autistic behaviours' and 'autism testing' were removed for not being about people. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: There were several instances of \"ASD dataset\" which are not easy to determine if they are about people or not. Do they mean dataset composed from blood tests taken as part of ASD testing? If so, each row in the data set would be a blood test with the possibility that more than one test comes from the same person. Or do they mean a pool of case records, each of which represents a single person? The former would not be \"about people\" but the second would. I did not remove these rows as we cannot be certain. Leaving them out would also have been a valid option, as long as the choice was clear. \n",
