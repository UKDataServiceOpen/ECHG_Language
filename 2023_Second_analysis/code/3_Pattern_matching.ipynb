    "We could use the same basic approach to look at person-first and identity-first language for other conditions for which there are good noun and adjective forms of the words (diabetes? obesity? cancer? something else?).

However, that lies outside the scope of this research, so I will not address it further here. \n",

Both of these steps will improve the sentence tokenisation that happens next. \n",

This punctuation, like the capitalisation at the start of the sentences or for the poper nouns, is also retained as it helps the sentence-tokenisation process identify the words within the sentence correctly for their parts of speech (e.g. which of the words are nouns, verbs, etc. ). \n",

However, this sentence would be eliminated in the consolidation phase as the keyword does not fit into either the person-first or identity-first patterns. \n",

This phase also removes any square brackets, quotes and extra commas introduced by the lemmatisation process. \n",

    "NOTE: There were several instances of \"ASD dataset\" which are not easy to determine if they are about people or not. Do they mean dataset composed from blood tests taken as part of ASD testing? If so, each row in the data set would be a blood test with the possibility that more than one test comes from the same person. Or do they mean a pool of case records, each of which represents a single person? The former would not be \"about people\" but the second would. I did not remove these rows as we cannot be certain. Leaving them out would also have been a valid option, as long as the choice was clear. \n",
