23,443,Preliminary Findings In The Diagnostic Evaluation Of A Sample Of 103 Individuals With Pervasive DevelopmentDisorders,P0341., E. Steiner   M. M. Guerreiro  A. P.

In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation screening for inborn errors of metabolism karyotypein folic acid deficient medium and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation. Until now the following conditions were detected Down syndrome (n = 3) untreated phenylketonuria (n = 2) Rett syndrome (n = 2) tuberous sclero sis (n = 1) fragile X syndrome (n = 1) 5 other dysmorphic conditions 2non genetic etiologies and 2 individuals with chromosomal polymor phisms. Besides those 4 individuals presented no PDD and 3 individualshad infantile psychosis. These data suggest that in at least 15% of thissample a main etiologic factor could be identified. Although the diagnosisof a specific genetic condition do not modify the treatment of autistic indi viduals in most cases it is of significant importance to the genetic coun seling of their relatives. For this reason we reinforce the importance ofcareful dysmorphologic examination and complementary tests in any per son presenting with PDD besides neurologic and psychiatric evaluation. ,2001.0,dgmfcm@unicamp.br,,,In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation screening for inborn errors of metabolism karyotypein folic acid deficient medium and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation.,,autistic behavior

Brondum NielsenJohn F. Kennedy Institute  Glostrup  D,The subtelomeric regions are often involved in chromosomal rearrange 172 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyments. They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated One group consisted of 14 patients with autism andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found A 1pter deletion resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR growth retardation and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR epilepsy microcephaly and dysmorphism consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR microcephaly an atrial septum defect and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients. In conclusion three out of 41 (7.3%) patients with idiopathic MR were foundto have subtelomeric rearrangements in concordance with the prevalence(5 10%) in previous studies. ,2001.0,els@kennedy.dk,,,Two groups of patients all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated One group consisted of 14 patients with autism andwith at least one other relative affected with autism.,patient with autism,

Even before the causative gene for this syndrome was identified pedigree studies indicated that it was likely to be an X linked dominant disorder with presumed lethality in males. Nonetheless there were a fewdescriptions of males suspected of having Rett syndrome. These includesporadic cases meeting the clinical inclusion criteria sporadic males withKlinefelter syndrome (47 XXY) and males with severe neonatalencephalopathy in known Rett syndrome families. With the recent discov ery that the MECP2 gene on Xq28 is the gene responsible for most casesof Rett syndrome it is possible to molecularly assess cases suspected ofhaving male Rett syndrome by direct sequencing analysis. We describethe first 4 cases of molecularly confirmed cases of Rett syndrome in Israel. One of the families presented here consists of a female having classicalRett syndrome and a male sibling with severe neonatal encephalopathy. Molecular analysis revealed that both sister and brother have the sameMECP2 gene mutation however their mother does not suggestinggermline mosaicism. The case emphasizes the point that maternalgermline mosaicism may lead to affected female or male offspring whichshould be taken into consideration during genetic counseling regardingrecurrence risks and suggests that prenatal diagnosis may be warrantedin siblings of apparently sporadic cases of Rett syndrome. It also highlightsthe importance of molecular diagnosis in every case of idiopathic neonatalencephalopathy in males. ,2001.0,aviorr@tasmc.health.gov.il,,,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized bycognitive and adaptive regression with autistic features loss of acquiredskills like speech and hand usage stereotypic hand movements epilepsy ataxia and deceleration of head growth that almost exclusively affectsfemales.,regression with autistic,autistic feature

Although the CpGisland of SNURF SNRPN demonstrated a clear difference of histoneacetylation other human loci did not demonstrate such parent of originspecific differences even in the CpG island of those genes where parent of origin specific DNA methylation has been demonstrated. In contrast inmouse fibroblasts the maternally derived inactive allele is less acetylatedthan the paternally derived active allele at all tested loci with the moststriking difference detected at the CpG island of Snurf Snrpn.

Clas sical RS features seem to occur almost exclusively in females with an esti mated prevalence of one in 10 000 15 000 female birth. The vast majori ties of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin and are due to de novomutations. Mutations in the Methyl CpG Binding protein 2 gene have been identified in roughly 75 % of classical Rett girls. We collected DNA samplesfrom 42 Italian classical Rett girls and screened the MECP2 coding regionfor mutations by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography(DHPLC) and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently devel oped method for mutation screening combining high sensitivity reducedcost per run and high throughput. In our study 16 different de novoMECP2 mutations seven of which were previously unreported were foundin 32/42 Rett girls (76%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized ina total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identifi cation of 14/16 different mutations (87%) after optimal conditions wereestablished this figure increased to 100% with all recurrent MECP2 muta tions generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Standardizationof DHPLC reagents and methods seems to be critical to the reliability andaccuracy of mutation prediction. Detailed analysis of signature shape retention time and retention time differences between peaks will allow sig nature based sequence identification at least for the most commonMECP2 mutations and SNPs. ,2001.0,talycarella@tigem.it,,,Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disordercharacterized by several clinical abnormalities such as progressiveencephalopathy autistic behavior and stereotyped hand movements.,,autistic behavior

The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line.

It is caused by muta tions in the FGD1 gene located in Xp11.21. Since many X linked mentalretardation (XLMR) conditions localize to a broad region encompassingXp11.2 we began a mutational analysis of XLMR families linked to Xp11.2as well as males from small unstudied XLMR families. In one affectedmale in the families a shift in exon 4 of FGD1 was detected by SSCP. Sequence analysis revealed a C1665T change which gave rise to anamino acid substitution P312L. The base change was confirmed by StyIdigestion of the altered allele. Analysis of the family indicated the C1665Talteration segregated with XLMR in the family. The C1665T alteration wasnot detected in 250 normal X chromosomes. The phenotype of the affect ed males is non syndromic. Except for a tendency towards short stature (ator below the 10 %tile) the affected males did not exhibit any of the hall mark features of ASD widow s peak prominent forehead hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures joint hyperextensibility shawl scrotum or foot deformations . Furthermore all three males hadsevere MR that is not a feature of AS. Utilization of several programs forsecondary sequence analysis revealed that the substitution of a leucine forproline at position 312 appears to lengthen a coil region two fold by remov ing a beta turn. FGD1 is now like RSK2 and MECP2 in that mutations in itgive rise to both syndromic and nonsyndromic XLMR conditions. ,2001.0,tatesschwartz@ggc.org,,,Except for a tendency towards short stature (ator below the 10 %tile) the affected males did not exhibit any of the hall mark features of ASD widow s peak prominent forehead hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures joint hyperextensibility shawl scrotum or foot deformations .,,ASD widow

Birk4 1Children s Hospital Research Foundation  Cincinnati  OH United States  2Hospital for Sick Children  Toronto  ON Canada  3University of Iowa  Iowa City  IA United States  4Thomas Jefferson University  Philadelphia  PA United S,"Approximately one third to one half of individuals with classical Ehlers Danlos syndrome (types I/II) have detectable abnormalities in the genesencoding the proa1(V) (COL5A1) or proa2(V) (COL5A2) chains of type Vcollagen a quantitatively minor component of type I collagen rich fibrils. Electron micrographs of skin from some patients with EDS were reportedto have larger diameter collagen fibrils than control. In general largerdiameter collagen fibrils correlate directly with structural properties (stiff ness and maximum force) and material properties (modulus and maximumstress) of tissues yet dermal tissues of classical EDS patients are friableand dermal scars have apparent reduced mechanical strength. To investi gate this apparent paradox we examined matrix deposition and collagenfibril morphology in long term cultures of fibroblast cell strains that have afourfold difference in the ratio of type V to type I collagen gene expression. Compared to control cells fibroblasts from 2 patients with OI type I due toCOL1A1 haploinsufficiency deposited 46% of hydroxyproline per mg pro tein and EDS cells from 2 patients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiencydeposited 38%. However the EDS cells synthesized approximately thesame amount of total collagen as controls and had similar secreted ratiosof type I/type III collagen as control cells. Average collagen fibril diameterfrom EDS cells was 39.6Ã¢\x80\x93 12.5 nanometers compared to 32.6Ã¢\x80\x936.9 nm forcontrol and 25.1Ã¢\x80\x93 5.2 nm for OI cells. These data indicate that type V col lagen may serve a dual function in dermal tissues. In addition to its posit ed role as a negative regulator of collagen fibril diameter type V collagenmay serve as a rate limiting nucleator of collagen fibrillogenesis in dermis. A reduced rate of collagen fibril formation in the dermis of classical EDSpatients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiency may override any mechanicaladvantage conferred by increased fibril diameter.412 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian disorderP1588.

Alport syndrome can be caused by mutations in COL4A5 one ofthe six type IV collagen genes. The most common form of the Alport syn drome is an X linked dominant trait that has been associated with the geneof the alpha5 chain of type IV collagen (COL4A5). More than 300 differentmutations have been identified in COL4A5 gene and they appear random ly along the whole gene. We report the first systematic mutation screeningof all 51 exons with boundary intronic sequences of COL4A5 gene by sin gle stranded conformation analysis (SSCA) after amplification of eachexon by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in forty two patientsfrom 16 randomly collected ASD suspected families in slovenian population. The nucleotide sequence of all PCR products revealed by the abnormalmobility shift on PCR SSCA was determined by the direct sequencingmethod using dsDNA cycle sequencing system (Perkin Elmer). PCR SSCA of the COL4A5 gene of eight unrelated Alport families showed thepresence of seven different mutations. Seven different mutations wereidentified in 8 families by cycle sequencing. Six of them are to the best ofour knowledge new G669R (GGT>CGT) G325R (GGA>CGA) R266X(CGA>TGA) G811R (GGA>AGA) G319D (GGT>GAT) and 1234+17 Tdel. Intronic mutation 1234+17 T del most likely influences the splicing ofmRNA. As previously described (5) mutation G624D(GGT>GAT) has beenidentified in two families.

Vikkula1 1Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology  Brussels  Belgium  2Uni  versit  catholique de Louvain  Brussels  Belgium  3Katholieke Universiteit Leuven  Leuven  B,"Non syndromic cardiac septation defects are common yet the responsiblegenetic changes remain uncharacterised. However mutations in theCSX/Nkx2 5 gene encoding a cardiac specific homeobox transcription fac tor have been reported to cause atrial septal defects (ASD) associated withatrioventricular (AV) conduction block. The CSX gene is expressed in car diac muscle during embryonic fetal and adult life and its Drosophilaortholog tinman is essential for the formation of the dorsal vessel. Target ed homozygous disruption of Nkx2 5 in mice causes lethality due to failureof heart looping. In man eleven mutations in the CSX gene have beendescribed in individuals with variable cardiac phenotypes. The majority hasASD and/or atrioventricular conduction defects. In addition ventricularseptal defects (VSD) tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) subvalvular aortic stenosis ventricular hypertrophy pulmonary atresia mitral valve abnormalities andEbstein s anomaly are observed. Along our studies on non syndromicfamilial cardiopathies we have collected two families with some memberspresenting ASD and AV block. In both families we identified a novel CSXmutation in the homeodomain Variable expressivity in the phenotype wasobserved in one of the families. In the first generation pacemakers havebeen implanted in the second two unaffected carriers and two memberswith ASD secundum (ASDII) and TOF were identified. Finally in the thirdgeneration members with ASDII VSD pulmonary stenosis atrioventricu lar septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were observed. Thusthe phenotypes caused by CSX mutations vary from non expression severe arrhythmia to TOF and PDA. Importantly mutation carriers do notnecessarily present AV block at young age.

141,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by impairment in social interactions and in language and communication skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities. The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic susceptibility to autism and a high incidence in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650 band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome, there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes) can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average, throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose. Control hybridizations with normal male to male, male to female and female to female reference samples were performed and showed the expected results.

Methods: Clinical Posters Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 114 115 manifestation, family data, history of pregnancy, parental age and anthropometric traits were analysed and compared in two groups of patients with deletion and mUPD. Cytogenetic analysis was routinely performed using HRBT in all patients. FISH was done in all cases which were diagnosed in our genetic unit. Methylation analysis, gene dosage analysis for SNRPN and polymorphism analysis for loci within the PWS/ASD region are included in our molecular diagnostic procedure. Results: PWS diagnosis was confirmed by methylation test in 77 (38%) patients. Among them deletion was detected in 40 (25%) patients, mUPD in 11 (14,2%) and imprinting mutation in 1 (1.3%) patient. Detection of the molecular defect was impossible in 6 (7,8%) patients because of uninformative polymorphism analysis results. For 19 patients the procedure for the purpose of molecular defect detection is in progress. Detailed comparison of phenotype and anthropometric evaluation will be presented in the group of deletion and non deletion patients. Discussion: Our results of clinical and molecular investigations are comparable with those from published analyses. The numerous group of clinicaly missdiagnosed patients indicated on difficulties in the process of PWS diagnosis. It points to how much still needs to be done to increase practical knowledge of PWS natural history and clinical symptoms among medical doctors in Poland.",2002.0,,"Z. Szpecht Potocka , E.

157,461,Breakpoints in 17p13 associated with Asperger  syndrome.,P0370.,,"autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by major difficulties in social interaction with unusual responses to the environment similar to those in a mild form of autism. 0.3 0.6% of the population will meet the criteria of AS. The clinical features includes paucity of empathy, difficulties to form friendships with social isolation as a consequence. The syndrome also includes pedantic and monotonic speech and highly circumscribed interests in topics such as the weather and railway tables or maps. We have identified two non related patients with ASD both with apparently balanced reciprocal translocations with breakpoints in 17p13. Cytogenetic analysis revealed de novo translocations t(13;17)(q14;p13) and t(17;19)(p13;cen) respectively. Mapping the translocation breakpoints of the chromosomes 17p was performed by FISH. Chromosome 17p13 specific clones were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of the two translocations. The results demonstrated the two breakpoints to be located within a region of 300 kb.

171,781,Genotype / Phenotype Correlations In A Large  Series Of Rett Syndrome Patients,P0690.,,"Mutations in the human Xq28 linked MECP2 gene are responsible for 70 to 80% of Rett syndrome cases and also for atypical clinical presentations. We are presenting the results of our studies in a serie of 64 female cases in which we looked for mutations in the MECP2 gene. These patients were divided into three groups : Group I (23 patients) with Rett syndrome diagnosed in our multidisciplinary consultation. Group II (28 patients) referred by external collaborators for a suspicion of Rett syndrome Group III (17 patients) from our center exhibiting a severe encephalopathy with autistic behaviour. In the first group, 21 mutations were identified ; in the second, 8 mutations and zero in the third group. These results confirm that the vast majority of mutations in the MECP2 gene lead to a classical Rett syndrome phenotype. They also show that a large proportion of girls with a severe mental handicap are not found to be associated with a MECP2 mutation on the contrary to what was recently proposed in the litterature. In addition, we did not find any genotype phenotype correlations for the Rett syndrome patients taking into account the mutation type, the functional domain affected by the mutation and the X chromosome inactivation status of these patients except for the mutation involving the C terminal domain associated with a ÃÂ« forme frustre ÃÂ» of the disease.

173,799,Angelman syndrome: a genetic and clinical  survey of 243 patients.,P0708.,,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a difficult clinical diagnosis and a heterogeneous genetic basis. More than 70% of patients carry a 15q microdeletion detectable by FISH. Up to 5% of patients have maternal UPD, identifiable by segregation analysis of chromosome 15 microsatellites. Up to 5 10% of cases are due to an abnormal imprinting process. M PCR test reveals all genetic defects except mutations in the UBE3A/E6 AP gene, which are responsible for the remaining 20% of cases. We report on 243 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ASD analyzed by one or more of the following techniques: FISH, M PCR, chromosome 15 haplotyping, UBE3A mutation screening. In order to define the recurrence risk in IC patients, microdeletions were tested by Southern blot analysis and sequencing of the minimal overlapping region of ASD deletion. Fifty five cases negative just Posters Mental Retardation 224 225 by FISH or M PCR were excluded by further analyses because of insufficient diagnostic criteria at clinical re evaluation.

Patients had maternal deletion 15q11 q13 (84%), paternal disomy (10%), imprinting defects (1%) or mutations of the UBE3A gene (4%). There was no phenotype genotype correlation for sleep disturbances in AS. The mechanism of sleep disorder in ASD is complex, insomnia may be related to abnormalities in brain development which may include abnormal function of the circadian system and seizures play a part in night awakenings.

Method: Parents of 21 children with BBS seen for a multidisciplinary clinical assessment completed standardised measures of behaviour. Results: Children with BBS showed elevated levels of internalising problems including feeling withdrawn and anxious/depressed. They also had elevated levels of social, thought and attention problems. A significant minority scored in the clinical range on a measure of autistic symptoms, although none met clinical diagnostic criteria. The children also had elevated scores on a measure of repetitive behaviour and the majority was reported to be obsessive by their parents. Conclusions: These findings indicate considerable clinical need that had been unmet in many families.

214,283,Normal live born offspring of an Angelman  syndrome mother with the Prader Willi syndrome  phenotype,P192.,,"Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) are two clinically distinct neurodevelopmental conditions that are caused by the lack of expression of imprinted genes in the PWS/ASD critical region on chromosome 15q11 q13. This can result from one of several genetic mechanisms, which include deletions, uniparental disomy, intragenic mutations, imprinting mutations and rare balanced translocations. We report on a woman who presented with a clinical PWS phenotype, but following molecular testing was diagnosed with atypical AS. Microsatellite analysis in the proband showed biparental inheritance of markers located within and outside of the AS/PWS critical region. The combination of an abnormal methylation pattern and biparental inheritance indicated that the cause of ASD in the proband was due to an imprinting mutation carried on her maternal chromosome. Haplotype analysis showed that the proband and her Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology102 103 unaffected brother had inherited the same maternal chromosome, suggesting that the imprinting mutation had arisen de novo or that the probandÃ¢ÂÂs mother was a gonadal mosaic. A faint maternal band on the probandÃ¢ÂÂs blot was suggestive of mosaicism. Further analysis showed that the child of the proband had also inherited the mutation carrying grand maternal chromosome. The normal phenotype and methylation of the child provides evidence that the proband was a mosaic. This case report has identified another ASD patient with the PWS phenotype, has described the first case of a live born unaffected offspring of an ASD patient and has provided evidence that these mild ASD phenotypes are the product of de novo imprinting mutations resulting in cellular mosaicism.",2003.0,,"Aldridge1, L.

215,284,Apparent mosaic imprinting defect characteristic  of Angelman syndrome in a patient presenting for  molecular genetic analysis for Prader Willi syndrome,P193.,,"A 16 year old patient with delayed development and obesity was referred for cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis for fragile X and Prader Willi syndrome. Methylation analysis at the SNRPN locus using Southern Blotting revealed a strong paternal band but a faint maternal band, a pattern more consistent with a mosaic Angelman result than a Prader Willi result. Methylation specific PCR analysis and repeat blot analysis on a second sample confirmed this result thereby excluding technical artefact. FISH analysis using a probe for D15S10 excluded a deletion or duplication of this region. Microsatellite analysis using markers across 15q11 q13 and in distal 15q revealed a pattern consistent with biparental inheritance. This supports the proposal that this patient is mosaic for an imprinting defect resulting in the majority of lymphocytes having both chromosome 15s marked with a maternal epigenotype at this locus. This is a further case of a patient with ASD presenting with features of PWS caused by a mosaic imprinting defect (as reported by Gillessen Kaesbach G et al (1999). Cases of both atypical and typical ASD have been reported with a similar result (K Buiting, personal communication).

239,705,Mutations In The Col4a4 Gene In Relation To  Familial Hematuria,P615.,,"Mutations in COL4A4 gene have been reported in autosomal recesive and dominant type of Alport syndrome (AS), as well as benign familial hematuria (BHF) or thin basement membrane disease (TBMD). BHF probably affects at least 1% of the population and is characterized by persistent microscopic glomerular hematuria, sometimes with proteinuria or hypertension, thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and normal renal function. Considering the similarities in GBM abnormalities, TBMD cannot be clinically differentiated from the initial stages of AS. It has recently been suggested that TBMD represents a carrier state of autosomal recessive or X linked AS. We analyzed 22 patients with confirmed BHF and 12 ASD patients who had tested negative in COL4A5 gene screening also for COL4A4 mutations. Non isotopic single stranded conformation analysis (SSCA) after amplification of each exon with boundary intronic sequences by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for all 51 exons of COL4A5 and 47 exons of COL4A4 gene. While no mutation was identified in COL4A5 gene in all 34 patients COL4A4 mutation screening disclosed eleven common polymorphisms that are shared in part with other populations and six novel mutations: G774R (GGT>CGT), G789G (GGA>GGT), 2860+2T>G, R908W (CGG>GGG), D1049H (GAC>CAC)+del 5 bp, 3506 8T>G and 4081 8G>C comprising three missense mutations, one frameshift and two potentially splice site mutations. Furthermore, we found one silent mutation, one rare variant in a non coding region, and several polymorphism with a very low heterozygosity.

There are no other laboratory Ã¯Â¬Ândings of note and no evidence of any abnormality of bone or liver metabolism, or altered skeletal architecture.

Subsequently, failure to thrive, acquired microcephaly, and autistic behaviours were observed. Seizures and an abnormal EEG were also seen. The hyperphosphatasia (867ÃÂ±72 IU/L, n=7) is associated with decreased pyridoxal 5Ã¢ÂÂ phosphate (B 6), and the question of aberrant vitamin B6 metabolism has been raised in this condition before.

268,292,Adolescental problems in KBG syndrome: our experience,P0175.,,"G. Moscati"" Hospital, Avellino, Italy. KBG syndrome is a rare, but underestimated, autosomal dominant disease (40 cases described), characterized by macro oligodontia, short stature, mild to medium mental retardation, skeletal defects and other clinical features. We report 7 sporadic cases, 3 M and 4 F, observed during adolescence. This period is characterized by the modiÃ¯Â¬Âcation of previous relationships, that leads, to a possible change in the role and importance of the family and reference Ã¯Â¬Âgures. The child grows and Ã¢ÂÂthe chrysalis becomes butterÃ¯Â¬ÂyÃ¢ÂÂ. The process seems complicated and difÃ¯Â¬Âcult in KBG patient. He links superÃ¯Â¬Âcially to other persons. His world remains limited to a biunivocal relation with the mother, that lasts longer than the other children, so remaining in a condition of passivity and greatest dependence. He understands he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt overtake the daily problems without help. He reacts isolating from the real life, taking refuge in a fantastic world. He closes himself in a autistic passivity as the only answer to his own inadequacy. The world outside seems to him full of hostility. More than ten years ago we chose, in favour of patients with genetic syndrome, a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a clinical genetist. Therapeutical results have been satisfactory in KBG patients. We noted: acceptance of their own body, more optimistic approach to life, improvement of school and working integration, higher control of nutritional and drug addiction. This experience improved our life and our profession, allowing a deep and empathyc interaction between patient and physician, that represents the true essence of every medical act.",2005.0,,"Biondi , D.

280,461,Delineation of a 5q35 microdeletion in congenital heart  disease: haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency of NKX2 5 can cause Ebstein  anomaly,P0345.,,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) represent the most common group of inborn malformations, with an incidence of almost 1%. One of the genes associated with CHD is the NKX2 5 gene, which encodes a cardiac homeobox transcription factor. Mutations of NKX2 5, which is located at 5q35.1 have been identiÃ¯Â¬Âed in a subset of familial and sporadic cases of atrioventricular (AV) conduction block associated with a spectrum of structural heart defects, including atrial septal defect (ASD) and tetratology of Fallot. Functional studies of NKX2 5 mutations have indicated that haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency determines the AV conduction block and ASD phenotypes. However, some studies suggest dominant negative effects and it has not been possible to correlate other NKX2 5 phenotypes with a speciÃ¯Â¬Âc mechanism of the mutation due to a small sample size. Here, we present delineation of a microdeletion in a patient with AV conduction block, ASD and tricuspid valve malformation (Ebstein anomaly) in addition to microcephaly, scoliosis and pectoral hypoplasia. FISH mapping of an apparently balanced inversion, 46, XY, inv(5)(q13q35) de novo, revealed a 2.2 megabase deletion at the distal inversion breakpoint. This region contains 17 RefSeq genes, including NKX2 5. This case gives therefore strong evidence for haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency of NKX2 5 as the cause of Ebstein anomaly.

ASD of the secundum type is characterised by an incomplete coverage of the ostium secundum resulting in a left to right shunting. The effects of the ASD range from subclinical to severe symptoms including pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias and heart failure. ASD is mostly sporadic but several familial cases have been reported. We describe two extended Swedish families with isolated autosomal dominant ASD. Using polymorphic microsatellite markers, we performed a genome wide scan in search for chromosomal regions linked to ASD. Linkage to the previously described candidate loci including the COMP and GATA4 genes were excluded for the two families. We identiÃ¯Â¬Âed a 23 cM region on chromosome 15 (15p11 q13) which is linked to the disease phenotype. The region is restricted by recombination events between the markers D15S165 and D15S659 and we calculated a maximum cumulative LOD score for the two families of 3.6 assuming full penetrance.

331,1338,BARCODE: a new software for comparative dating of  haplotypic nested lineages,P1225.,,"We present a new software for comparative dating estimates of haplotypic lineages deÃ¯Â¬Âned by Unique Event Polymorphisms (UEP), on the basis of linked STR diversity. BARCODE (Basic ASD Regression for COmparative Dating Estimates), applies a comparative dating approach free of assumptions on STR mutation rates to detect the linear accumulation of ASD over time. Its power relies on the exploitation of the UEP deÃ¯Â¬Âned phylogeny, which provides a unique solution for the order of nodes in the tree to be analysed. The set of possible solutions to be tested for ASD TIME linearity is created through an algorithm speciÃ¯Â¬Âcally created. The more the phylogeny has a nested shape, the more the dating result is robust. BARCODE allows to weight each lineage according to its frequency in the dataset, a fundamental option Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology348 when the sampled lineages include variants supposed to be ancestral to a demographic expansion or when dealing with data unbalanced in sample size. We report the results obtained by running BARCODE on published Y chromosomal data sets. The relative dating estimates are in general agreement with the absolute estimates originally published. The results also allow inferences on STR mutation rates (ASD TIME regression slopes): some critical loci emerged, which show variable mutation patterns across the data sets. However, most STR loci show a similar behaviour across the data sets, thus conÃ¯Â¬Ârming their informativeness. The most commonly used STR loci can then be ranked in different classes, according to their mutation rates, independently on the particular data set considered.

Standard cytogenetic analysis revealed that he carried a de novo apparently balanced translocation, t(1;5)(q23;q22). Searching for cryptic chromosome abnormalities, YAC clones in the region of the chromosomal breakpoints were selected and used as FISH probes . The patient showed a deletion in chromosome 1 from q23 .3 to q24 .2, with a loss of about 8 Mb . In an attempt to further characterize the deletion, with the aim to delineate a better genotype phenotype correlation, whole genome screening was conducted using array based CGH analysis, at a resolution of 75 kb . The array CGH data confirmed a cryptic deletion in the q23.3 to q24.2 region, without other imbalances. The breakpoints were better refined and the size of the deletion was evaluated in 4 .97 Mb .

Detailed breakpoint analysis in these 2 cases using FISH with bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes, microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping has identified a deleted region of approximately 1 .33Mb, with a 324kb difference between the two deletions . At least 30 genes are deleted . The precise region of loss has been defined allowing us to identify genes that may contribute to the clinical phenotype through hemizygosity . Assignment of clinical features to specific breakpoints and refinement of predictive value may be useful in counselling .",2006.0,,"BÃÂ©ri Dexheimer1, M. GrÃÂ©goire1, B. Leheup2, A. Toutain3, S.

No similar patients had been described in literature so far, since all the cases reported with a chromosomal mosaicism (Dufke et al, 2001; Kuharya et al, 2002), resulting from a parental balanced translocation, presumably derived their abnormal karyotype from a meiotic error and a postzygotic rescue . Our patient clearly demonstrate that an aberrant mitotic segregation can be a possible althoug rare outcome of a balanced translocation .

It was localized in the presynaptic membrane and the presynaptic active zone of central nervous system synapses . Neurotrypsin is expressed in the cerebral cortex, the hyppocampus and the amygdala, suggesting a role in learning, memory and emotion . Neurotrypsin (PRSS12) mutation is associated with autosomal recessive mental retardation . To date, seven patients from three consanguineous families who are all originally from the same area of Eastern Algeria have been identified with the same mutation (4 base pair deletion in exon 7 of the PRSS12), suggesting a founder effect in this population . Clinical examination revealed impaired voluntary saccadic eye movements in the horizontal and vertical direction whatever the nature of the stimulation (visual, auditory, somesthesic . Ophthalmological examination including FO and ERG was unremarkable .

There is great variability in expressivity of the phenotype . We screened 4 sporadic patients and 3 index cases of families with ASD and/or conduction defects . In one of them, a CSX/NKX2 5 mutation was identified. This novel mutation (p.

Surprisingly, no CSX/NKX2 5 mutation was found in the 2 other families presenting a characteristic phenotype of CSX/NKX2 5 mutated individuals .

419,1234,Evaluation of ms mLPA for molecular diagnosis of  Prader Willi and Angelman syndrome in a clinical context,P1218.,,"Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) are distinct syndrome characterized by developmental impairment, caused by loss of expression of imprinted genes in the paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) chromosomal region 15q11 q13 . Molecular genetic testing is important to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to predict the familial recurrence risk which depends on the underlying molecular mechanism [deletion (in 75% of PWS and ASD cases), uniparental disomy (UPD), an imprinting error or point mutations] . In most diagnostic laboratories methylation specific PCR or Southern blot analysis is used . Additional testing (FISH, UPD analysis) is required to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism . An ideal molecular test should provide information about both parent specific methylation imprinting on 15q11 q13 and the underlying genetic mechanism . Recently, methylation specific multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MS MLPA) became commercially available. This technique allows detection of changes in CpG methylation and copy number of chromosomal sequences in a single reaction . We evaluated this technique for diagnostic applications in a clinical setting . Using MS MLPA we tested a group of 16 patients with previously confirmed PWS (7) and ASD (9) respectively. The molecular diagnosis and underlying molecular mechanism were confirmed in all cases . A comparison was made between MS MLPA and Southern blot results . We conclude that MS MLPA is a powerful technique, suitable for molecular diagnostics of PWS/ASD in a clinical context . MS MLPA has important advantages compared to other techniques as starting from genomic DNA, information about methylation status and underlying molecular mechanism is provided within in a single experiment, resulting in a shorter turnover time .",2006.0,,"Claes , K.

Afterwards he tried to graduate from expert school for social sciences which could not be completed because of his special defects in social competence and communication skills, and his deficiency of empathy which, at the end of the initiated diagnostic procedure, led to the diagnosis of autism. Since recent studies (1) were able to show a defined interstitial dupli cation of chromosome15q11 13 in a few patients with autism (1 3%) we investigated this region with respect to this abnormality . We were able to show a duplication of the region of interest with the proof of three alleles for the internal markers D15S122, D15S822 and D15S1234. Furthermore we could confirm this result with FISH using the probe GABRB3 (15q11 12),which showed three signals on meta and inter phase chromosomes. Parental investigations (FISH and molecular analysis) were inconspic uous. Microsatellite analysis showed that the duplication did arise from the boy`s maternal chromosome 15, as described in the literature (2).

Until recently RS was considered lethal in males, although now approximately 60 cases have been reported. Males with MECP2 mutations present with a broad spectrum of phenotypes rang ing from neonatal encephalopathy to non syndromic MR. Five males (aged 3 16 years) evaluated for MR, had normal karyotype and four of them were evaluated for molecular variation associated with the FMR1 locus, with negative results. Patient 1 presented with features of FXS, including long face, protruding ears and behavioral problems. Patient 2 had spasticity, pyramidal signs and trunk stereoty pies, while his brother (Patient 3) showed slight psychomotor retarda tion. Patients 4 and 5 presented with autistic features. MECP2 analysis of the exons 3 and 4 was performed by Denaturant Gradient Gel Elec trophoresis, sequencing and GAP PCR, using specifically designed sets of primers. The polymorphism p. T203M was identified in Patient 1, but not in his mother, raising questions about its contribution to the phenotype. Patient 2 and 3 had a novel deletion at the deletion prone region of MECP2 (c.1140del86) inherited from their unaffected carrier mother. The GAP PCR in Patient 4 showed evidence of a large rearrangement encompassing exons 3 and 4, which requires further evaluation. His mother was normal. Patient 5 presented the p.

They may occur even in healthy individuals. The incidence of minor anomalies has been studied in search for a relationship between different non syndromic disease and abnormal embryogenesis. They are used as indicators of altered embryonic differentiation. Their positive correlation with disturbances of neurological development occurring during embryogenesis has been established. Patients with mental retardation, cerebral palsy and autism were evaluated for the presence of minor anomalies. Data were compared with those obtained from a control group. The frequency of the minor anomalies was not significantly different in the two groups. When expressing the mean values as minor anomalies per child, the figures were 2.92 in affected individuals and 1.43 in the healthy ones. A positive correlation with the severity of mental retardation was noticed. 64% of the cases with cerebral palsy and 56% of the patients with autism had at least three minor anomalies.

In 1993, Mehes described a Hungarian family with three patients, a mother and her son and daughter, presenting delayed speech development, facial asymmetry, strabismus and trans verse earlobe creases (TEC). In 2005, four new unrelated Hungarian children were reported with similar features. We describe a new patient, of Spanish and French origins, who pres ents a similar phenotype. The girl was the eutrophic product of a 36 week gestation. No motor delay was observed but delayed speech marked the development of the girl. At 4 years autistic behaviour was suspected and psychiatric therapy was instored. The proposita began to speak at 5 years and her course was marked by mild mental retardation with anxious behaviour. At 20 years, weight, height and OFC are in the normal range. The patient presents facial asymmetry, narrow down slanting palpebral fis sures, low set ears with TEC. She has umbilical hernia and hyper trophic small labia. Skeletal X rays were normal, cerebral MRI shows abnormal signal of right putamen. Chromosome studies : metaphase karyotype, subtelomeric analysis (MLPA), and FISH studies (22q11.2, 11p15) showed no anomaly. Molecular analysis for Beckwith Wiede mann syndrome was also normal.

Among the three genes of the minimal critical region (from centromere to telomere: SHANK3 , ACR and RABL2B ), SHANK3 is considered to be at the origin of the neurobehavioral symptoms. We report a child with a de novo interstitial 22q13.3 deletion detected by MLPA and confirmed by FISH. She demonstrates mental retardation, severe speech delay, epicanthic fold, and protruding ears with normal growth. This non specific pheno type is concordant with the classical presentation of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. Subtelomeres analysis by MLPA showed a discrepancy between the P036B and P070 kits (MCR Holland): P070 MLPA probe (targeting ARSA gene) showed a deletion but P036B (targeting RABL2B gene) showed a normal result. FISH analysis using LSI TUPLE1 /LSI ARSA (Vysis) probes confirmed deletion of ARSA , whereas FISH with N25/ N85A3 (Cytocell) probes, targeting SHANK3 locus was normal. This was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR of exons 23 and 24 of SHANK3 . Supplemented FISH analysis using BAC clones were per formed to delineate both breakpoint regions of the interstitial deletion. These data highlight the difficulty of performing an appropriate test in order to search for cryptic 22q13.3 deletion.

Studying over 420,000 cells, we have determined the mean frequency of stochastic aneuploidy in control and autism: Control Chromosome loss Chromosome gain Autosomes Sex chromosomes0.58% (95% CI 0.42 0.75%) _0.15% (95% CI 0.09 0.21%) 1.11% (95% CI 0.90 1.31%) autism Autosomes Sex chromosomes0.60% (95% CI 0.37 0.83%) _0.22% (95% CI 0.14 0.30%) 1.01% (95% CI 0.85 1.17%) CI confidence interval The difference of stochastic aneuploidy rate was insignificant. However, the frequency of mosaic aneuploidy over the background level was found in 19 (16%) of 116 children with idiopathic autism, while outlier values were not found in controls. These data identify mosaic aneuploidy as a new autism genetic risk factor. Therefore, molecular cytogenetic analysis of somatic mosaicism is warranted in children with idiopathic au tism.

480,781,Analysis of molecular defects in Polish Angelman  Syndrome patients,P0646.,,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurogenetic disorder that is caused by impaired UBE3A gene expression resulting from changes in the parental genomic imprinting or specific mutations. Four known types of molecular defects might be responsible for the AS: deletion of 15q11 q13 region, paternal uniparental disomy, imprinting defects or UBE3A mutations. The imprinting defects may result from micro deletion of the imprinting center or somatic mosaicism. The aim of the study was the identification of molecular defect in the patients with clinical manifestation of AS. Two hundred twelve patients with clinical symptoms of ASD were in cluded in the study. First, the analysis of imprinting defect was done with PCR based DNA methylation analysis of PW71 and SNRPN loci (MS PCR). When the mosaic methylation pattern was detected, the quantitative methylation assay (QAMA) has been performed (28 cas Molecular and biochemical basis of disease1 es). The patients with the normal methylation pattern were qualified to the analysis of the UBE3A coding sequence. The QAMA analysis did not reveal somatic mosaicism in any of the patients selected for this procedure. In patients without imprinting de fect several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been found (T/G in intron 7, T/C in intron 9, A/G in exon 13, insT in intron 6). In one patient, the G>A substitution in exon 6 was found that changes alanine into threonine within hydrophobic domain of the protein.

493,985,Mutations in the MECP2 gene in patients of Slavonic  origin with Rett syndrome,P0852.,,"Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder affecting almost exclusively females. It has an incidence of 1:10,000 female births and is characterized by apparently normal development for the first 6 18 months of life followed by the loss of acquired motor and language skills, autistic features, and development of stereotypic hand movements. Rett syndrome is caused primarily by de novo mu tations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Methyl CpG binding protein 2 plays important roles in the regulation of gene expression and RNA splicing. Here we report the mutational analysis of the MECP2 gene in 95 patients from the Czech and Slovak Repub lics and the Ukraine with classical Rett syndrome. The patients, all girls, were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing of the entire coding sequence and the exon/intron boundaries of the MECP2 gene. RFLP analysis was performed to confirm the mutations that cause the creation or abolition of the restriction site. Mutation negative cases were subsequently examined by multiple ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to identify large deletions. Sequencing analysis revealed 33 different mutations in 74 patients, and MLPA analysis re vealed large deletions in two patients. The detection rate was 78%. One mutation in exon 1 (c.48_55del8) has not been published yet.

Gene MECP2 (methyl CpG binding protein) gene has been identified as the disease causing. RTT is one of the most com mon causes of mental retardation in females . After a period of normal development usually until 6 18 months of age, affected girls enter a period of regression, losing speech and motor skills, coincident with the onset of hand stereotypies, leading to loss of purposeful hand use, which is the hallmark of the disorder . MECP2 gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and is subject to X in activation. Gene mutations are identifiable in 80% of classic Rett syn drome, but less frequently in atypical RTT . First 10 unrelated patients (including 2 boys) with developmental delay and autistic features were referred for molecular diagnostic . Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes . MECP2 coding exons 2, 3, and partly exon 4, were amplified in 7 overlapping PCR fragments and analyzed by direct sequencing on ABI 310 genetic analyzer . No previ ously reported mutations were found in analyzed fragments . Studies of remaining part of MECP2 gene exon 4 for most common mutations in TRD domain are in progress .

Under some cir cumstances the child demonstrates aggressive behavior . The performed cytogenetic analysis showed pathological karyotype 46,XX,del(X)(p1 .22) . About 85% of the cases with Rett syndrome were caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 1 (MECP2) .

However, the causative muta tion is still unknown in the remaining 5% of the cases . The complete sequencing of MECP2 and CDKL5 genes revealed no mutations in the affected girl . In addition we sequenced the Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) gene, mutations in which have been shown to cause mental retardation either isolated or associated with a broad spectrum of neurological problems . This gene has been mainly affect ed in boys . As this gene is localized on the short arm of the X chromo some (Xp22 .13), one of its copies was missing in our Xp deleted girl .

Proband is the first and only child in the family. His birth anthropom etry (4020g/52cm, OFC 41cm) was above 97th centile. During the first two years of his life he had psychomotor developmental problems, hypotonia, seizures with EEG changes, autistic features, unilateral hy drocele and macrocephaly . Metabolic workshop excluded metabolic disorder . At the age of three years three lipomas were (histologically proved)diagnosed two subcutaneous and one pancreatic . The patient had different skin symptoms, no pigmentation of the glans penis . He had macrocephaly and mild mental retardation and some autistic fea tures and speech problems . Mutation analysis of PTEN gene was performed by Dr .D .O .Robinsin (Salisbury Health Care NHS Trust) . The patient is carring a C>A substi tution at base 144, in exon 2 of the PTEN gene . This mutation impairs the function of PTEN and is the cause of the patient`s symptoms . conclusion: clinical, pedigree data and results of moleculargenetic investigations of the patient having Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba syn drome are presented.

There are many diagnostic tools available like the FISH analysis, methylation based PCR, multi plex PCR, High Resolution Melting analysis and commercialized MS MLPA . Each of them has some disadvantages and limitations such as high costs, time consuming and requiring DNA bisulfite treatment. We introduce a novel, in house designed methylation specific competitive multiplex PCR, which takes three hours for the reaction, avoids bisul fite treatment of DNA and provides reliable results of PWS and AS. Material and methods: 68 patients with clinical suspicion of PWS, two with AS, and 20 unaffected individuals from the general population were analyzed. In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, we amplified one SNRPN control gene, the KRITI gene to serve as internal control, and the promoter of the SNRPN gene, which could be digested them with HhaI enzyme . By comparing the copy number of the three re gions, we could differentiate the wild type, deletion type and UPD type PWS within one reaction . We also evaluated other different diagnostic technologies in clinical applications . Results: In this article, we successfully made the molecular diagno sis of one ASD patients and 46 PWS patients by several different tech niques . In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, the total copy numbers were accurately calculated in all of the cases . Conclusions: The MS competitive multiplex PCR strategy is a good al ternative for molecular diagnosis of PWS and ASD . This approach could serve as an alternative genotyping platform for epigenetics .",2008.0,,"S. Y. Lin , C. H. Lin, Y. N.

We present a 10 year old girl with mild mental retardation, abnormal EEG, and au tistic behavior, who began to speak at 5 years . She had no dysmorphic features and her brain MRI was normal . Karyotype analysis revealed a de novo apparently balanced translocation t(6;14)(q16;q22) . Whole genome array CGH analysis with ~385,000 oligonucleotide probes (NimbleGen) identified an ~1.48 Mb deletion in 6q16.1. FISH with BAC clones mapping within and directly flanking the deleted segment showed that the deletion arose at the translocation breakpoint . Inter estingly, autism has been linked previously to chromosome 6q16 . The deleted segment harbors FUT9, GPR63, FHL5, KLHL32, c6orf66, and AK091365 and two predicted genes c6orf167 and KIA0776 . GPR63 is expressed almost exclusively in the brain and encodes a G pro tein coupled receptor for sphingosine 1 phosphate . The fucosyltrans ferase 9 gene, FUT9, is highly conserved among humans, mice, rats, and hamsters and is highly expressed in brain during embryogenesis .

Recent studies estimated a rate of 3 5% of cytogenetic abnormalities involving many different chromosomes in autism (ASDs) .

They carry balanced chromosome translocations, respectively a t(5;8)(q14 .3;q23 .3) and t(6;8)(q13;q23 .2) . A detailed physical map cov ering the regions involved in the translocations was constructed and FISH analyses were carried out using BAC clones mapping on chro mosomes 5q14.3, 6q13 and 8q23. We fine mapped the two transloca tion breakpoints on chromosomes 8 identifying their positions within a short 5 Mb genomic region . The results of these analyses showed that breakpoints on chromosomes 8 in both patients do not interrupt any known gene but both map in a region containing the CSMD3 gene . No genes were interrupted on chromosomes 5q14 .3 and 6q13 . Tak ing into account that CSMD3 is expressed in fetal and adult brain, our observations suggest that this gene is a good candidate for the patho genesis of ASDs . To exclude an over expression or under expression of CSMD3 leaded by the rearrangement, we verified the expression of this gene in the leukocytes of the translocated patient by RT PCR, but any transcript was detected .

649,63,incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in a series of 11  French patients with 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion detected using array cGH.,C02.3,,"Since the large implementation of array CGH in the diagnostic work up of mental retardation, novel microdeletion syndrome have been described. In particular, the 15q13.3 microdeletion has been identi fied in 0.2 0.3% of individuals with mental retardation and epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism and other neuropsychiatric features. The criti cal region between BP4 and BP5 contains at least seven genes, in cluding CHRNA7 , which is considered a good candidate gene for the epilepsy phenotype. We report a series of 11 patients (8 index cases and 3 affected parents) presenting a developmental delay and a 1.5 Mb 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion ascertained through 11 French CGH array platforms. All 8 index cases presented mild to moderate mental retardation with absent or non specific dysmorphic features. Only two had seizures, 4 had an abnormal electroencephalogram and none had an autistic behaviour. One patient presented a highly differ ent phenotype, including hydrocephaly, joint dislocations, congenital lymphoedema and notable dysmorphic features associated to men tal retardation. Familial studies could be performed in 5/8 index pa tients. Interestingly, all 15q13.3 microdeletions were inherited (3 from the mother, 2 from the father). The affected parents had mild mental retardation with epilepsy in one. In particular, the microdeletion was found in 2 completely asymptomatic mothers.

Regular chromosome analysis resulted in thirteen colonies showing a normal female karyotype and a single isolated metaphase with 47,XX,+18. After extensive work up according to international pre natal quality standards, no other colony with trisomy 18 was found in a total of 29 colonies. Therefore, the finding of a single Ã¢ÂÂ47,XX,+18Ã¢ÂÂ cell was considered to represent a pseudomosaicism and the foetus was diagnosed with a normal female karyotype. Fifteen years later and at the age of 14, the very same girl was re ferred to our department because of mental retardation and autistiform behaviour. After exclusion of a (pre)mutation for Fragile X syndrome, oligo array CGH analysis was performed, using the Agilent 105 K Ox ford array (custom design ID: 019015), in search for a previously un detected (sub)microscopic genomic imbalance. To our surprise, a slightly elevated ratio was found for all (2424) oligo probes on chromosome 18, suggestive for a mosaic pattern of trisomy 18. No further genomic aberrations were detected. Subsequent FISH analysis on interphase and metaphase cells of blood and other tissue samples from the patient confirmed the presence of a mosaic pattern for trisomy 18. This case demonstrates that , even after careful cytogenetic examina tion, a Ã¢ÂÂwith near certaintyÃ¢ÂÂ irrelevant pseudomosaicism might turn out to be a true mosaicism with clinical consequences after all.",2009.0,,"R.

Born at term with normal growth parameters, he demonstrated since the age of 6 months, growth and weight retardation. Delay in motor milestones was observed as the child did not sit alone at 9 months. He had also reduced social interactions. G banding showed the presence of a supernumerary chromosome (47,XY,+mar), composed, as revealed by high resolution aCGH, of 27 Mb from region 9p24.3 to 9p21.2 and 12,3 Mb from 15q11.2 to 15q13.3. This derivative chromosome [der(15)t(9;15)(p21.2;q13.3)] was subsequently found to derive from a maternal reciprocal trans location, very likely originating from a meiotic missegregation of 3:1 tertiary type. Partial trisomy 9p21.2 9pter is not well defined but two patients with an intrachromosomal duplication of chromosome arm 9p [dup(9)(p21p24)] demonstrated classical clinical manifestations of 9p trisomy with, in one case, features overlapping with Coffin Siris syndrome. Duplication of the 15q Prader Willi /Angelman syndrome region is mainly associated with autistic behavior, mental retardation and de velopmental delay. Most reported cases with associated clinical symp toms have been linked to extra copies of 15q11 q13 from maternal origin, paternally derived duplications being generally associated with a normal phenotype. Our results also support this observation. Presence of potential extra copies of numerous genes from chromo some 9p in addition to the duplicated 15q region renders a clinical prognosis difficult.

728,1004,A 2.2mb microduplication in 1q42.2 including DISC  in 2  brothers with autism and mild mental retardation,P09.018,,"A growing number of copy number variations (CNV) are detected in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorder. However, the interpre tation is not always straightforward. We describe the identification and delineation of a 2.2Mb microdupli cation in 1q42.2 in 2 brothers with autism and mild mental retardation. The duplication was detected by Array CGH with clones from the 1 Mb BAC/PAC clone set (Sanger Institute Hinxton, UK). The aberration was further delineated to 2.2Mb with a full tiling BAC array. By means of quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) the breakpoints of the duplication were mapped and segregation in the family was investigated. qPCR was used to screen 260 patients with autism for DISC1 duplications. The 2.2Mb duplication was present in the proband, his affected brother and the apparently unaffected father and paternal grandmother. Since this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, it was con sidered as a rare variant. Within this region the most interesting gene with respect to autism is DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ) since it is known to be involved in schizophrenia and has recently been as sociated to autism and bipolar disorder. A group of 260 patients with autism was studied for the occurrence of DISC1 duplications, but no additional duplications were found. This study is a typical illustration of the difficult interpretation of causal ity of a rare variant in neuropsychiatric disease.

We present here a compre hensive molecular testing for XLASD using several technologies and an algorithm that maintains good sensitivity while limiting cost. For adult onset XLAS, we developed an assay identifying the three most common adult type XLASD mutations in the US; C1564S, L1649R, and R1677Q. For molecular diagnostic testing of individuals with unknown mutations we developed a DNA sequencing assay to identify point mutations and small deletions and insertions. Additionally, a Multiplex Ligation Probe dependant Amplification assay (MLPA) and NimblegenÃ¢ÂÂs Chromosome X Tiling array were evaluated to detect complete or partial (exonic level) deletions and duplications in COL4A5. We developed a public online searchable data base that contains 446 entries from the literature. In this repository, 88% of the mutations are point mutations and small deletions or duplications and 12% are large rearrangements (deletions and duplications at the exonic level).

Currently, 300 individuals with ASD have been identified in 44 different countries. ASD is caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, which comprises >224 kb of genomic DNA, 23 exons and encoding a predicted 461.2 kDa protein with unknown func tion. CGC Genetics is the reference laboratory for AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome International. Here we report our experience and contribution for the identification of new AlstrÃÂ¶m patients. Method: In 2004 2008, we received 52 samples for ALMS1 gene anal ysis from 8 different countries, from patients with clinically established diagnosis and also from patients clinically suspected for AS. Our ap proach for the molecular genetic testing was the complete sequence analysis of exons 10 and 16, plus a portion of exon 8. Results: Causative mutations (missense) were identified in 13 patients in both alleles and also 6 new nonsense mutations. In 6 patients we found a causative mutation only on one chromosome. Conclusion: Being a rare disorder and not commonly known, ASD is most probably underdiagnosed, has delayed diagnosis or is even mis diagnosis. Genetic test allows an earlier diagnosis of the disease.

774,11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,,"People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2 gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2 is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2 can be used as a unique window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2 gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2 is itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children. High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2 dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice. Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions of FOXP2 to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between genes, speech and language.",2010.0,,S.

Review, identification and grading of results by panel of invited ex perts. Consensus meetings at which experts present, discuss and agree recommendations. Initial drafting of guideline document which is circulated amongst ex perts and stakeholders for comments. Amendments incorporated and guideline finalised. Guidelines piloted and evaluated. International dissemination. The process has involved 49 experts from 8 countries reviewing be tween them, over 1000 papers. The WS guidelines are currently being piloted in 20 centres, by paediatricians and geneticists. The first draft of ASD guidelines has been circulated for feedback. Consensus meet ings for NS and KS will be held very shortly. The finished guidelines will be available from the DYSCERNE website.",2010.0,,"P. M. Griffiths1, K. Strong1, S. Gardner1, R. Day1, C.

Their carriers have a high risk of primary infertility, spontane ous abortions or children with unbalanced karyotypes. We report an unusual case of a familial CCR involving three chromosomes. An 8 year old girl was referred for chromosome analysis because of heart defect, dysmorphic facial features, mild mental retardation and autistic features including a delay of speech development. Karyotyping revealed derivative chromosomes 20 and 22. For further clarification of the rearrangement, FISH was performed using 20p and 20q subtelo meric probes. It showed that material from 20p was translocated onto 22p. Array CGH was essential for the identification of the suspected third partner in this CCR: It showed a 3q duplication of about 16.5 Mb, and the CCR thus involved chromosomes 3, 20 and 22. Karyotyping and FISH analysis of other relatives indicated that four members of this family are carriers of a balanced form of this CCR. These individuals are asymptomatic. Four of their descendants have two types of unbalanced CCRs. The proband and her maternal aunt have partial duplications of chromosome 3. Both have similar dysmor phic facial features and mental retardation, but the aunt is lacking the heart defect and autism. Two other individuals have partial duplica tions of chromosome 20. These children are currently very young. Their mental functioning seems to be normal, but the motor develop ment is delayed and macrosomia is present in both cases.

The clinical phenotype in these patients includes developmental delay/mental retardation, defects of brain, heart and kidney, craniofacial malformations and dysmorphic features. The com mon deleted region, 2.2 Mb, harbouring 12 genes, has been defined as critical for this syndrome. ATXN1 , located within this interval, has been suggested as a candidate gene for the mental retardation based on its expression in CNS and the cognitive impairments manifested in knock out mice. We report on two patients carrying partly overlapping de novo deletions within 6p22.3, which are smaller than the ones pre viously reported. Patient 1 displays mild mental retardation and behav ioural problems; her 115 kb deletion (chr6:16215803 16332297, hg19) encompasses only GMPR and ATXN1 . Patient 2 has severe mental retardation, autistic features and hyperactivity. Her deletion spans 2.3 Mb (chr6:14545576 16846846, hg19) and includes JARID2 , DTNBP1 and MYLIP , in addition to GMPR and ATXN1 . Because the GMP re ductases encoded by GMPR and GMPR2 have redundant functions, haploinsufficiency of GMPR is not likely causing the cognitive impair ments in our patients. We therefore suggest that ATXN1 hemizygosity is sufficient to cause the mental retardation in patient 1. Furthermore, additional genes such as MYLIP , which is expressed in brain and has been shown to have a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, is expected to contribute to the significantly more severe phenotype of patient 2.Cytogenetics11",2010.0,,"T.

The group of pervasive developmental disorder (PDDs), also termed autism (ASDs), includes the prototypical autism as well as PDD not otherwise specified (PDD), Complex traits and polygenic disorder220 Rett syndrome and aspergerÃ¢ÂÂs disorder. autism is characterized by difficulties in managing social interaction and communication, and a limited, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of reactions and behavior. ASDs are etiologically heterogenous, and only 10% of the cases are due to known medical conditions (chromosomal imbalances, genetic disorder like Fragile X, Rett syndrome or Tuberous sclerosis). The emerge of new high resolution screening methods allows for de tection of submicroscopic genomic aberrations. One of these methods; microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) offers the possibility of detecting copy number variations (CNVs, deletions or duplications) associated with autism. We present the results of applying aCGH for identification of causal CNVs in 50 children diagnosed with autism. Genomic DNA was ex tracted from buccal cells and aCGH was performed using 44k and 105k human genome CGH oligo microarrays (Agilent Technologies Inc.). Causal CNVs were identified in 9 (18%) of the patients. Two pa tients had large aberrations (unbalanced translocation between chro mosome 8 and chromosome 12, idic(15)). Five patients had smaller CNVs in or close to genes previously associated with autism, and two patients had CNVs not previously reported.

The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2, CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes. Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected. The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/ASD revealed 64% mutations along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren and Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome. Altogether, we manage to clarify the molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients, PWS/ASD and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.

927,42, Ankylosing s pondylitis,S10.2,,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory arthropathy affecting primarily the spine and pelvis, with a disease prevalence of 0.4% in white Europeans. Susceptibility to ASD is known to be highly heritable (h2>90%), and the major gene for the condition, HLA B27, has been known since 1972. However, only 1 5% of HLA B27 carriers develop AS, and 10 20% of cases do not carry the gene, suggesting that other genes must be involved. Genetic studies of ASD have made rapid progress over the past 5 years, with associations with novel genes 14 Concurrent Symposia 14 and genetic loci providing insights into the disease pathogenesis, stimulating much follow up functional research and therapeutic development. In order to identify further genetic variants predisposing to AS, a gwas was performed involving 1782 British and Australian cases fulfilling modified New York Criteria, and 5167 historical controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2). The study was combined with existing results from the Australo Anglo American ASD Consortium (TASC) consortium, and replication of the most significant findings performed in 2109 cases and 4410 controls from Australia, Britain, and the Canadian SPARCC consortium. As well as confirming known associations at HLA, IL23R, ERAP1, KIF21B, 2p15 and 21q22, we identified and subsequently replicated risk predisposing variants in RUNX3, IL12B, and LTBR, and found suggestive association at ANTXR2, PTGER4, CARD9 , TRADD and TBKBP1 TBX21. Additionally, we identified a single SNP within the MHC, rs4349859, which lies near the gene MICA and tags HLA B27 with near perfect sensitivity (98%) and specificity (99%). Studies in cases and controls carrying different HLA B27 subtypes, some ASD associated and some not, indicate that rs4349859 is not itself ASD causative, and further reduce the likelihood that an HLA B*27 linked gene is responsible for the association of B27 with AS. This SNP is far cheaper and easier to genotype than HLA B*27 itself, and can be used as an alternative to HLA B*27 typing, at least in European populations. In most common disease the proposed genetic model involves interaction between loci, but to date no convincing examples of such interaction have been demonstrated. We identified an interaction between HLA B*27 and variants within ERAP1 in the WTCCC2 (p,0.02), TASC (p,0.014) and replication datasets (p,0.0019). Specifically, risk variants in ERAP1 increased odds of disease in HLA B*27 positive, but not HLA B*27 negative, cases (combined P,7.3x10 6). In contrast, SNPs at other ASD loci, including IL23R, KIF21B, IL12B and the intergenic regions 2p15 and 21q22, were ASD associated in both HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27 ve disease. This result indicates that HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27 ve forms of disease have substantially different but overlapping aetiologies. Interestingly, in a separate WTCCC2 study, we have demonstrated that ERAP1is associated with psoriasis, and that the association is restricted to cases carrying the HLA Class I protein HLA Cw6. The findings support mechanisms of association of HLA B*27 and ERAP1 with ASD that involve peptide presentation, and that ERAP1 contributes to disease risk through its action in trimming peptides prior to loading into nascent HLA class I molecules, rather than by cleaving pro inflammatory cytokine receptors on the cell membrane. Many further genes are likely to be identified over the coming years. The International Genetics of Ankylosing Spondylitis Consortium will perform what will likely be the definitive SNP genotyping study of AS, involving over 12,000 cases and 20,000 healthy controls genotyped for 200,000 markers targeting immunogenetically relevant genes using the Ã¢ÂÂImmunochipÃ¢ÂÂ. This study will bring new findings including new genes, fine mapping of known genes, data about the value of genetic risk prediction in different world populations, and even pharmacogenetic data regarding TNF antagonist response and intolerance.

The exact aetiology of autism remains unknown, although it is likely to result from a complex combination of genetic, neurological, and environmental factors. Recent high resolution microarray based studies in autism have identified a number of novel submicroscopic copy number variants (CNVs) including both deletions and duplications. We report two children with autistic behavior and mental retardation. We have used genomic array CytoChip Oligo (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK), format 2x105K, version 1.1. and BlueFuse Multi software, version 2.2. The 2x105K array detects 35 Kb imbalances on the backbone and has tiling of 20 probes over 137 OMIM disease loci.

Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndrome are distinct neurogenetic disorder, caused by chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy or loss of the imprinted gene expression in 15q11 13 region. While PWS occurs from a lack of the paternally expressed gene contribution, ASD originates from a lack of the maternally expressed gene expression in the region, specifically UBE3A. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical diagnosis using different comparative molecular methods. The study group consisted in 14 children (age 2 10 years) presumptively diagnosed with PWS and one case with ASD at UMF Timisoara Pediatric Hospital and 10 normal patients (control).DNA and RNA samples were isolated from white cell blood. For MS PCR 700ng of DNA was sodium bisufite treated. RNA samples were reverstranscribed with Access Quick Kit (Promega). Epigenetic changes at SNRPN gene locus were evaluated with MS PCR technique. Two non imprinted genes expression (NIPA1 and OCA2) was evaluated by qReal Time PCR for identification of deletions type 1,2,3. SALSA MS MLPA kit ME028 was used to detect copy number changes and to analyze CpG islands methylation of the 15q11 region.4/14 children presented deletions type 1,2,3 and 6/14 display imprinting defect (all PWS). In children with 15q11 13 deletions, no or poor NIPA1, OCA2 gene expression was found, depending on deletion type.

989,541, 12p13.33 microdeletion syndrome: redefining the associated clinical phenotype,P03.022,,"Subtelomeric rearrangement associated with developemental disabilities detection rate represents 5% of the etiologies. Sub telomeric or interstitial deletions of less than 5 Mb involving chromosome 12p13.33 is one the least frequently deleted region. Only 5 patients diagnosed with FISH telomere analysis or array CGH have been reported. The most phenotypic manifestation of this microdeletion seems to be speech delay associated with autism phenotype. Two of them were inherited from an apparently healthy parent, suggesting variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance. A French collaboration together with a search in the Decipher database permitted to gather 6 novel patients (4 probands) with a 12p13.33 subtelomeric or interstitial rearrangement identified by high resolution array CGH to further delineate this rare microdeletional syndrome. Speech delay was found in 5/6 patients, with dysarthry in 3/6, mental retardation in 4/6 patients, ASD phenotype in 3/6 patients, mild non specific dysmorphism (3/6) with prominent ear lobes in 2/6 patients, normal growth parameters with macrocephaly in 1/6 patient and microcephaly in 1/6.

Sub telomeric or interstitial deletions of less than 5 Mb involving chromosome 12p13.33 is one the least frequently deleted region.

The most phenotypic manifestation of this microdeletion seems to be speech delay associated with autism phenotype. Two of them were inherited from an apparently healthy parent, suggesting variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.

Myocardial hypertrophy without clinical impact was detected, a finding that decreased over the years. At the age of 3 years and 10 months, microcephaly persists and weight and length are under the 3 rd percentile. The boy presented with several dysmorphic features, e.g. brachycephaly with bitemporal narrowing, dysplastic, cup shaped ears, hypertelorism, micropenis. There are feeding difficulties and regurgitations. He has a global developmental delay, especially speech development is impaired. There are an autistic like manner and phases of behaviour problems with restlessness and laughter attacks. Molecular cytogenetic analysis of the subtelomeric regions identified a secondary signal of the chromosome 21 subtelomere probe on the distal short arm of one chromosome 21. An additional interstitial deletion was detected with a probe specific for the Down critical region and other region specific probes. The deletion encompasses 6.5 Mb distal to RUNX1 and the duplication 4.85 Mb as determined by tiling array CGH analysis.

The inv dup (15) or idic (15) is the most common of the heterogeneous group of the extra structurally abnormal chromosomes (ESAC). Two cytogenetics types have been identified. One is a metacentric or submetacentric and heterochromatic chromosome, not containing the Prader Willi syndrome/ Angelman syndrome Critical Region (PWS/ASCR) [dic(15)(q11).dic(15)(q11)], can be familial or de novo and most children show a normal phenotype. The second type has 15q euchromatin including PWS/ASCR [dic(15)(q12 or q13)], that frequently derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis. This condition is associated with an abnormal phenotype, which constitutes the idic(15) syndrome, and is nearly always sporadic. The inv dup (15) displays distinctive clinical findings represented by early central hypotonia and intellectual disability, epilepsy and autistic behaviour. Expressive language is absent or very poor and often echolalic. Epilepsy with a wide variety of seizures, as a typical Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS), can occur in these individuals. Areas of increased and reduced skin pigmentation can be occasionally observed.

He presents behavioral disorder as depression, impulsivity, hyperactivity and relationships difficulties with other children. EEG shows epilepsy. He uses short sentences but with pronunciations difficulties. Developmental quotient was evaluated at 63 (Terman Merrill). Minor dysmorphic features were observed with upslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, mild retrognathia and protruding upper lip with long philtrum. Growth parameters at 7 years are in the normal range. CGH analysis showed a 2.015 Mb deletion distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. The deletion is maternally inherited. The family belongs to underprivileged socio cultural environment with relatives presenting learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities. Given this blurring familial situation, this deletion was initially considered as being of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore polymorphic CNV were reported in this region. Two publications (Edelmann et al., 2007 ; J Med Genet 44:136 143 and Ramocki et al., 2010 ; Am J Hum Genet 87:857 865) reported deletions or duplications distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. These patients exhibit variable expression of epilepsy, learning difficulties, intellectual disabilities (mild to severe developmental delay or intellectual disability with autistic features in some patients) and/or neurobehavioral abnormalities (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and aggression including self abusive behavior and depression).

1045,1100, t NFalpha gene polymorphisms in Romanian HLA B27 positive patients with ankylosing spondylitis,P09.019,,"Dr. C. T. Nicolau, Bucharest, Romania, 3ICA Research and Development, Bucharest, Romania, 4Grigore Antipa National Museum of Natural History, Bucharest, Romania. Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the prototypic seronegative spondyloarthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the spine and sacroiliac joints. HLA B27 is a genetic marker for AS. Moreover, elucidating the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in ASD has important diagnostic and therapeutic significance, given the good results obtained with anti TNF therapy in these patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate three TNFalpha gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA B27 positive ankylosing spondylitis patients from Romania. Methods: 112 Romanian unrelated ASD patients (97M/15F) and 76 (40M/36F) ethnically match healthy controls were genotyped for TNF alpha 308G/A, 238G/A and 857C/T polymorphisms using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays C 7514879 10, C 2215707 10 and C 11918223 10 (Applied Biosystems, USA). All subjects were HLA B27 positives. Association tests for each polymorphism and for the estimated haplotypes were performed with the software package PLINK v 1.07.Results: The minor allele TNF 857T was more frequent in ASD patients (24%) than in controls (19%), but not statistically significant (p,0.2). None of the three SNPs were individually associated with susceptibility to ASD in HLA B27 positive patients.

After stringent quality control measures, we compared 3K cases to over 19K ethnically matched controls in a two stage genome wide association design. In all, we uncovered 275 statistically significant distinct copy number variable regions. The 60 genes nearest these robust CNVRs are most enriched in gene networks impacting neurological disease, behavior and developmental disorder. A more focused analysis of a subset of 87 CNVRs that are predicted to disrupt 26 genes highlights GABA receptor signaling, and methionine/glutathione trans sulfuration as the most significant canonical pathways disrupted in ASD. Furthermore, we used available family members to characterize CNVRs into inherited vs de novo and used ethnicity information to characterize their effects in different ethnic populations.

Among a large number of MHC genes it was the HLA B27, which was strongly associated with autoimmune arthropathies. Also few other candidate genes were involved in the development of pathogenesis. Most of those genes take part in various immunological processes such as differentiation and antigen presentation. In this research we study variability of candidate gene ERAP1 specially in Russian Caucasian population.

Many genetic and environmental factors are incriminated in its pathogenesis. Subacute exposure to organophosphates (OPs) during critical periods of prenatal neurodevelopment is one of the factors that may trigger autism. Human serum paraoxonase (PON1) is a HDL associated hydrolase, which in addition to hydrolyzing the OPs, plays a physiological role in reducing LDL oxidation. The PON1 gene shows two functional polymorphisms: M55L and Q192R. These polymorphisms influence the concentration and activity of PON1 towards different substrates, including OPs.

Identification of genes causing non syndromic XLMR has long been challenging but large scale systematic resequencing has been shown to be promising for the discovery of rare, disease causing sequence variants. We report on a family including 10 affected males with severe MR and several females with variable cognitive impairment consistent with X linked recessive inheritance. Male patients all had severe mental retardation and behavior problems. Dysmorphic features included long narrow face, malar hypoplasia, large forehead, full nasal root, thin nose, small philtrum. Head circumference was normal. They had no marfanoid habitus or visceral malformations. Brain MRI, in two patients, showed isolated moderate cerebral atrophy. Most affected females were moderately mentally affected but one of them had severe MR with autistic features. The initial linkage study revealed a localization region from Xp11.21 (AlaS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5) in 6 of 7 affected males. A novel, unreported frameshift mutation was identified in the MED12 gene by exome sequencing performed within the EuroMRX consortium. The mutation segregated with disease in all affected males. MED12 encodes a subunit of the mediator complex, which serves as an interface between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.

1172,36, De Novo Mutations in Neurodevelopmental disorders,S10.3,,"INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia (SCZ), autism and intellectual deficiency (ID) are common, devastating and poorly treated neurodevelopmental brain disorder. The wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical variability in these disorder suggest a complex genetic etiology, which is consistent with the numerous loci thus far identified by linkage, copy number variation and association studies. Although heritability in all three disorder may be as high as ~80%, the genes responsible for much ESHG Concurrent Symposia Abstracts European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org12 www.eshg.orgof this heritability remain to be identified. Based on the observed redu ced reproductive fitness, the relatively uniform world wide incidence, the increased risk of disease with increasing paternal age and the phenotypic complexity of each disease, we, and others, hypothesized that a fraction of this missing heritability may be the result of the occurrence of de novo mu tations affecting any of a large number of genes. In order to test this hypo thesis we first sequenced over 400 synaptic genes in 148 subjects with SCZ, 148 subjects with ASD and 96 subjects with ID. Many likely de novo mutati ons were identified these plus relevant functional studies will be presen ted. Next we sequenced the exomes of SCZ, ASD and ID probands, plus their parents, identifying numerous additional de novo mutations (DNMs). In ad dition, 1/4 of identified DNMs are nonsense mutations, which is more than what is expected by chance. Interestingly, some of the identified genes, such as SHANK3, show deleterious de novo mutations in patients from the three disease cohorts, suggesting close biological overlap in these disorder. Our study supports the notion that DNMs may account for some of the missing heritability SCZ, ASD and ID while providing a list of genes possibly involved in disease pathogenesis.",2012.0,,"G. A.

In 15 cases (10%) was necessary the analysis of parental samples, showing that 6 anomalies (40%) had occurred de novo and was classified as pathogenic and in 9 cases (60%) appeared to be inherited from an unaffected parent. In a total of 40 patients (26,66%) was possible to detect a pathogenic CNVs .Recent studies suggest that when aCGH is performed with an apparently normal karyotype, the diagnostic yield increases by an additional 8 17%. In our study we have obtained a 26,66% of children with pathogenic CNVs that is higher than the results obtained by other authors.

We describe six patients from three unrelated consanguineous Egyptian families with a novel characteristic brain malformation at the level of the diencephalic mesencephalic junction (DMJ). Diagnostic testing including high resolution karyotyping and extended metabolic screening were nor mal. Brain MRI demonstrated a dysplasia of the DMJ with a characteristic Ã¢ÂÂbutterflyÃ¢ÂÂ like contour of the midbrain on axial sections. Additional ima ging features included variable degrees of supratentorial ventricular dilata tion and hypoplasia to complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Diffusion tensor imaging showed diffuse hypomyelination and lack of an identifiable corticospinal tract. All patients displayed severe cognitive impairment, post natal progressive microcephaly, axial hypotonia, spastic quadriparesis and seizures. autistic features were noted in older cases. Talipes equinovarus, non obstructive cardiomyopathy and persistent hyperplastic primary vi treous were additional findings in two families. One of the patients required shunting for hydrocephalus, however, this yielded no change in ventricular size suggestive of dysplasia rather than obstruction.

The well known underlying molecular mechanism of this condition, also referred to as FRAXE, is a (CCG)n trinu cleotide repeat expansion which leads to silencing of the FMR2 gene. Addi tionally, deletions within the FMR2 gene were described in handful number individuals with ID. Here we report on a de novo 131 kb deletion of FMR2 gene in a 2 years old boy with a mild developmental delay, behaviour changes, hypotonia, and discrete facial dysmorphism. The deletion, detected by SNP array ana lysis (Affymetrix 250 K Nsp I), spans between the base pairs 147454718 147586323 (NCBI36). The aberration and its de novo origin were confirmed by MLPA. RNA analysis on the patient showed a 994 bp deletion of AFF2 transcript, resulting in the complete loss of exons 2 and 3.In conclusion, this case report further confirms the role of FMR2 gene dele tions as a FRAXE phenotype underlying mechanism.

On the NEO PI R personality test KS patients scored high on the neuroticism scale, low on the extraversion scale and low on the conscientiousness scale. Men with KS have deficits in several cognitive domains and have an alte red personality phenotype. Furthermore our results suggest that KS patient may be associated with an increased genetic vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms.

1240,460, Brain specific X chromosome aneuploidy is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of autism and can explain the unsolved paradox of male susceptibility,P03.022,,"autism is a common childhood psychiatric disorder characterized by impai red social interaction and communication, repetitive/stereotypic behavior. Numerous studies indicate that chromosomal and genomic imbalances play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism. However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain the prime target of the disease have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorder, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. autism currently affect four times as many males as females.

1241,470,Chromosome kissing in association with the ATR X syndrome,P03.036,,"ATR X (X linked ÃÂ± thalassemia / mental retardation) syndrome is one of the syndrome associated with abnormal epigenetic gene regulation, which appears males with X linked mental retardation, HbH disease, skeletal ab normalities, and autistic behavior. ATR X syndrome is caused by a mutation in the ATRX gene localized on the X chromosome (Xq21.1), which encodes ATRX protein, one of the chromatin remodeling proteins. However, the details of molecular mechanism with symptoms of this syndrome are still unknown. Here to learn more about the relationships between nuclear ar chitecture and failure of epigenetic regulation in the ATR X syndrome, we ex amined characteristics of spatial positioning of following three chromosome arm specific regions by 3D FISH technique; 1) Xq (ATRX gene has mapped on), 2) 16p (HBA has mapped on), and 3) 11p (HBB has mapped on). After image acquisition by confocal laser scaning microscope, analysis of relative spatial positioning of three painted regions was performed. The results sho wed that neighborhood association of particular two chromosome territory regions called as chromosome kissing was observed with high frequency between Xq and 16p and between 11p and 16p in cell nuclei from the ATR X syndrome patients, respectively. The frequency of the same combination from the normal individual is approximately halves of them, respectively.

We applied a fast BAC Genome Array CGH platform (Cytochips Blue gnome, Techno genetics Bouty). Cyto Chips are high quality BAC microarrays (4898 BAC Clones spotted in quadruplicate 0.6 Mb). This ap proach led us to discover further cryptic chromosomal rearrangements, pre viously undetected by conventional cytogenetic procedures. We identified two genes: SLC8A3 (human gene for member 3 of solute carrier family 8), a sodium calcium exchanger electively expressed in the brain, and a possible candidate gene for Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2010) and the CSMD1 gene (Cub and sushi multiple domains 1) a candidate gene for autism associated with Mental Retardation (MR) and Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2011). This approach allows us to better delineate the genotype/phenotype correlation in our pa tients.

1285,896, Analysis of polymorphisms in GABRA2 and AUTS2 genes in patients with alcoholism from Russia,P08.02,,"Family, twin and adoption studies have provided evidence of a genetic component (40 60%) in the origins of addictive disorder. One of very few confirmed genetic association findings differentiating alcoholics from non alcoholics is with variants in the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid a2 receptor subunit (GABRA2 ) gene. Also according to the recent genome wide association study variation in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2 ) was strongly associated with alcohol consumption. Population stratification and ancestry differences within populations may compromise the success of association studies. Therefore analysis of genes variants in homogeneous ethnic groups is of great importance. We designed a classical case control association study for two polymorphis ms: rs279858 in GABRA2 and rs6943555 in AUTS2 that were tested for asso ciation with alcoholism. 307 men with ICD 10 diagnosis of alcoholism (112 Russians, 91 Tatars, 100 Bashkirs), and matched control groups were typed for the above mentioned gene variants using PCR RFLP technique. In Russian population the frequency of individuals carrying the *G allele of rs279858 polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with early onset alcoholism as compared with the healthy controls (p,0.03;OR,1.40). The carriers of GABRA2*A/*A genotype were found to be at low risk of al coholism development (p,0.04;OR,0,57). In Tatars the frequency of AUTS2 rs6943555 *T allele was higher in group of alcoholics with acute alcohol psychosis (0.74) as compared with controls (0.64). However observed diffe rences were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that GABRA2 genetic variation might be involved in the development of alcoholism in Russians.

His parents do not carry this microdeletion, indicating that it was a de novo event. autism (ASD, OMIM 209850) encompasses different forms of autism with a broader phenotype. Two thirds of all patients with ASD suffer from mental retardation. Among the genes involved, AUTS2 dis ruption has been described in 7 patients with ASD and mental retardation. In all of these seven patients translocations with different breakpoints bet ween exon 1 and 7 and different translocation partners were the underlying mechanism of the disruption.

Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant.

COL4A5 gene on chromosome Xq22 23 accounts for Ã¢ÂÂ¼80% of all ASD cases (XLAS). COL4A3/COL4A4 genes on chro mosome 2q36 q37 account for the remaining cases (ARAS).We are studying COL4A3/COL4A4/COL4A5 genes (in ASD and in familial he maturia) for the last 9 years. Depending on inheritance pattern, we screen either COL4A5 or either COL4A3/COL4A4 or all three genes (totally ~150 exons). COL4A5 is analyzed by genomic PCRs and direct re sequencing. CO L4A3/COL4A4 screening is accomplished by genomic PCR and SURVEYOR endonuclease, followed by targeted DNA re sequencing. PCR RFLP is used for detecting more mutation carriers in the ASD families. We have DNA samp les from all Greek Cypriot ASD families (totally nine) refered to CyprusÃ¢ÂÂ hos pitals. Two were studied and published by a French laboratory in 2001 (one homozygous for the COL4A3 c.3533delC mutation and one with the de novo COL4A5 G618R mutation).

The diagnosis of autism is based on impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication, and restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests and activities, with abnormal development apparent within the first 3 years of life. autism (ASDs) include: autism, child hood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not other wise specified, autism and Rett syndrome. There is substantial evidence from twin and family studies to support the involvement of genetic factors in ASDs. We report a case of 3 years old boy with echolalia, irrelevant talk, not com prehensible. Muttered to himself occasionally, poor social interaction and avoided eye contact. He was unable to follow commands and responded to his name very rarely. The child was born after 8 yrs of a non consanguineous marriage, gestation was controlled and it was a full term caesarean delivery. The provisional clinical diagnosis was autistic features with hyperactivity. Karyotype was normal, X fragile syndrome analysis was normal too and was performed a genetic analysis using MLPA (SALSA ÃÂ®MLPAÃÂ® Subtelome ric Screening P070, X linked mental retardation P106 and Microdeletion syndrome P245). Analysis results showed a deletion in SHANK3 gene in 22q13.3. Parents were not carrier of this deletion.

1391,4, C terminal deletions of the AUTS2 locus cause distinct syndromic features and cognitive impairment,PL2.2,,"Translocations involving 7q21.22 have been associated with autism and in tellectual disability (ID). Discordant evidence has suggested that these cli nical phenotypes might be driven by a number of genes (AUTS2, WBSCR17, CALN1). Here, we examined whether AUTS2 disruptions are causal for neu rocognitive defects. An international cohort of ~50,000 patients and 16,000 controls was ex amined for CNVs in AUTS2 by array CGH and we performed detailed pheno typic analyses. 5âRACE experiments were performed to test for alternative transcripts in human brain. A zebrafish knock down model was generated to test the potential of different AUTS2 splice isoforms to induce some of the anatomical phenotypes seen in patients. We found 44 AUTS2 deletions. Microdeletions disrupting the coding se quence were causal to a complex syndromic ID/autism phenotype including short stature, microcephaly, cerebral palsy and distinct facial dysmorphis ms. The exonic AUTS2 deletions occur with a frequency comparable to NSD1 deletions causing Sotos syndrome. We also discovered a novel, highly con served, C terminal AUTS2 isoform in human brain. Clinical and functional studies showed this isoform to be a key contributor to the human phenotype because (a) patients with C terminal deletions exhibited significantly more severe and pleiotropic aspects of AUTS2 syndrome, and (b) the significant microcephaly and craniofacial defects seen in auts2 knockdown zebrafish embryos were rescued by this C terminal isoform. We identified a hitherto unappreciated syndromic phenotype caused by deletions in AUTS2, required for both brain and craniofacial development. The C terminal portion of the gene contributes significantly to the pheno type, demonstrating how transcriptional complexity can underpin human pathology. E. Voorhoeve: None. G. Beunders: None. C.

1424,251,The IL23R Non Synonymous Polymorphism rs11209026 is Associated with Radiographic Sacroiliitis in Spondyloarthritis,P01.066,,"Objective: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a group of inflammatory articular dis orders sharing genetic background. The non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs11209026 (Arg381Gln) in the IL23R gene, has reproducib ly been shown as associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Here, we ex amined the association between rs11209026 and SpA as a whole. Particular attention was devoted to genotype phenotype correlation. Methods: rs11209026 was genotyped in a French collection of 415 cases/372 controls and 383 trios. Association analysis was carried out in SpA as a whole group and then separately in ASD and non radiographic SpA (non AS) patients. Phenotype/genotype correlations were examined using a logistic regression analysis. Results: A significant association between rs11209026 and SpA was only identified in the familial dataset (P , 0.03; OR , 0.57). Strong associati on with ASD was observed in both case/control and familial datasets (P , 4.5x10 4 and 4x10 3, respectively). In contrast, such association was not detected with the non ASD group. Furthermore, rs11209026 frequency was significantly different between the ASD and non ASD patients (P , 2.5x10 3). Phenotype/genotype correlation study revealed that both radiographic sacroiliitis and an early onset were independently associated with a lower frequency of the rare protective rs11209026 allele A in patients (P , 9x10 3 and 8x10 3, respectively).Conclusion: Our study replicated the robust association between rs11209026 and AS, in the French population. However such association was restricted to ASD patients, as compared to non radiographic SpA. The fact that it was independently conditioned by radiographic sacroiliitis and age at onset sug gests that rs11209026 could affect the disease severity rather than suscep tibility. F.

1466,599,Fulminant Hepatic Failure associated with Phelan McDermid syndrome,P05.014,,"Phelan McDermid syndrome is caused by 22q13.3 deletion and its typical features are severe intellectual disability, absent or poor speech develop ment, decreased pain sensitivity, hypotonia and mild facial dysmorphism. The syndrome could also comprise autistic features, seizures or thermore gulation problems. Rare symtoms are hearing loss, genitourinary anomalies and congenital heart defect. Extremely rare is association of Phelan McDer mid syndrome and hepatic failure in early childhood. There have been de scribed only 2 patients with this condition so far. In these cases PIM3 gene (localized in 22q13.33) was considered to be responsible. We present 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with Phelan McDermid syn drome. Age at diagnosis ranges from 10 month to 55 years and deletion ex tent varies from 0.4 Mb to 7.6 Mb. All patients present common features of the syndrome, but they differ in inconstant sypmtoms. Any correlations between phenotype and deletion range havenâ²t been observed. Patients have been diagnosed using FISH and MLPA, deletion extents were proven by oligonucleotide arrayCGH. There are 6 patients with deleted PIM3 gene in our group, including two adult patients, but only one of these patients (10 year old boy with 1.9 Mb long deletion) has developed hepatic failure recently. Therefore simple PIM3 deletion doesnâ²t seem to be the cause of hepatic failure. The possible mechanism is an alteration of the gene on the other allele, epi genetic factors or mutation in some modifier genes.

1467,604,Submicroscopic abnormalities in a girl with mental retardation and dysmorphic findings revealed by aCGH analysis,P05.019,,"Specific copy number variations (CNVs) have been found to be associated with susceptibility to various intellectual and developmental disorder. One of those is mental retardation (MR) with developmental delay with an esti mated prevalence of 2 3% in the general population. Application of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to clinical practice, unraveled genetic aberration in MR patients with normal constitutional ka ryotype. Here we report a five year old girl with mental and motor retarda tion, epilepsy, and dysmorphic findings with normal constitutional karyo type. To determine the genetic contribution in the development of clinical findings, aCGH analysis was performed. Roche NimbleGen Human CGH ISCA Plus 3x1.4M Array was used for aCGH analysis. The data were analyzed by using Nexus6 software (BioDiscovery). As a result of aCGH analysis, 5 chro mosomal regions were marked as important regions. Among these regions, one of them has been found to be related with autism and intellectual disability, previously. Microdeletion in the PTCHD1 locus on Xp22.11 has been has been found in autism patients but not in he alty controls. However, we found a 24.3kb copy gain in the same locus in our patient. This finding showed that PTCHD1 locus may not be disrupted with deletion only, copy gain in that region might also have effect on the gene, and its function.

Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates. Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort.

1480,648, BKCa channels: a new therapeutic target in Fragile X Syndrome treatment,P05.067,,"The most common cause of inherited mental deficiency (MD) associated with autistic features, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), results from the FMR1 gene silencing and loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among synaptic proteins deregulated by the absence of Fmrp in fmr1 knock out (KO) mice (murine model for FXS), Kcnma1 (Î± subunit of large conductance Ca 2+ activated potassium channels, BKCa) seems to be the most significant deregulated one. Since several papers showed an involvement of BKCa chan nels in MD, this channel could be a new therapeutic target for FXS. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the molecular BKCa channel anomaly in fmr1 KO mouse model and 2) to evaluate the thera peutic effect of a BKCa channel opener molecule (BCOM), BMS 204352, on dendritic spines maturation of fmr1 KO neurons and on social behavior of fmr1 KO mice. In fmr1 KO mice, Kcnma1 protein quantity was lower in ce rebral structures and neurons, and associated with a reduced BKCa whole cell current. In vitro addition of BMS 204352 induced dendrite spines ma turation of fmr1 KO neurons. In vivo, using a behavioral test of direct social interaction, a single injection of BMS 204352 rescued affiliative behaviors to wild type level. In conclusion, we demonstrated 1) a Kcnma1 protein anomaly in fmr1 KO mice inducing a decrease in BKCa whole cell current, and 2) that a BCOM, BMS 204352, restored a regular phenotype of dendrite spines and social interaction in fmr1 KO mice. Therefore, BKCa channel could be a new thera peutic target in FXS treatment. B. Hebert: None. O. Perche: None. A. Menuet: None. N. Doisne: None. J. Pichon: None. B. Laudier: None. S.

1482,651,Study of a large Spanish cohort of 22q13 deletion syndromeÂ´s patients. A genotype phenotype correlation?,P05.070,,"Phelan McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the deletion or disruption of a 22q13 region containing the post synaptic protein gene SHANK3 . The clinical features of PMS (also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and otherdevelopmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmor phic features. Other less frequent features include seizures, brain, renal and cardiac malformations, motor deficits, and lymphedema Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, Clinical expression also varies widely, even among patients with small deletions, and no correlation between deletion size and phenotype has been found. A role for additional genetic factors, in addition to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, is likely. Because PMS is considered to be underdiagnosed, the true prevalence is unknown. Aims. We aim to define a possible genotype phenotype comparison to use high resolution deletion breakpoint mapping on a large cohort of patients, addressed the hypothesis that additional genes or regions of chromosome 22q13 besides SHANK3 may contribute to the PMS phenotype. Results. Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for more than 50 individuals in a patient cohort using a custom designed high resolution oli gonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform, prompting this genotype phenotype association study. Most of them have been studied by FISH, MLPA and array CGH and their clinical features have been defined. Interestingly, a great genetic variability, with deletion sizes between 10 Kb and as much as 9 MB was found. Conclusions. Preliminary data from this large cohort (first, with Spanish patients) were presented and may it provide additional data on genotype phenotype hypothesis. J. Nevado: None. M. Palomares: None. F.

1484,654," Identification of a novel missense mutation in HUWE1 (Xp11.2) segregating with intellectual disability in a large family, by Targeted High Throughput Sequencing.",P05.073,,"Genetic diagnosis in Intellectual Disability (ID) remains difficult because of the extreme genetic heterogeneity of this frequent condition. We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p. Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1 gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in 3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1 have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense was recently observed in a boy with autism but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p. Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family. A functional test of HUWE1 activity on DNA repair is currently performed on patientâs cells to confirm its pathogenicity. Y. Alembik: None. J. Lauer Zillhardt: None. B. Gerard: None. C.

Dysfunction of the gabaergic and glutamatergic systems has been also poin ted out since the balance between brain excitation and inhibition appears affected in the brain of the Mecp2 deficient mouse. However, the results are divergent due to the differences in the age and tissues studied. To date few projects have been dedicated to the follow GABA and Glutamate metabolism in eight different brain areas of the Mecp2 deficient mice. In the present stu dy we used real time PCR, western blotting and HPLC to compare the GABA and Glutamate metabolism in several key areas of the Mecp2 mutant mice brain at different developmental stages (early and late symptomatic). Key enzymes (Kcc2, Nkcc1, Vglut1/2, Gad1/2) will be considered. In conclusion, our results revealed a spatial and temporal deregulation of the glutamater gic and gabaergic systems for all levels of regulations studied.

MedykÃ³w 18,, Katowice, Poland. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation respon sible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene resulting in its transcriptional silencing. Leptin may be considered a cytokine like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, immune system, in addition to its role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. Thus, we hypothesized on in volvement of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of autism. Material and methods23 male patients, mean age 19,3 Â± 6,6, affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1 gene), were enrolled into the study. Controls were 24 healthy males, mean age 21,8 Â± 5,8. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA method. ResultsPlasma leptin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients were similar as in con trol group (11,53 Â± 10,24 ng/ml) vs (5,73 Â± 4,52) were not significantly dif ferent from those found in controls (p , 0,5).While plasma adiponectin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients (6,68 Â± 3,44 ng/ml) were significantly lower in controls (8,95 Â± 4,24) (p< 0,04).ConclusionAdiponectin may be involved in autistic features observed in FXS patients in light of its anti inflammatory properties.

MYT1L interacts directly with DISC1, which is involved in schizophrenia. We describe a family in which the father, his son and his daughter have a 549 kb interstitial duplication in the 2p25.3 region detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and confirmed by quantitative PCR. This duplication encompasses the five first exons and is predicted to disrupt the MYT1L gene. The phenotype includes: slight facial features including bulbous nasal tip, wide mouth, overfolded helix, strabismus, moderate intellectual disability (ID) with speech impedi ment, hypotonia, hyperactivity, mood disorder with aggressive behaviour, neonatal feeding difficulties followed by a tendency to hyperphagia with overweight and a prominent abdomen with thick panniculus adiposus. Par tial deletions of chromosome band 2p25.3 encompassing the MYT1L gene have been reported in patients presenting with ID and overweight whereas duplications disrupting the MYT1L gene have been reported in patients pre senting with autism and schizophrenia. Moreover, single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) of MYT1L contribute to major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Recently, de Ligt et al. reported a âde novoâ splice site mu tation of the MYT1L gene identified by exome sequencing in a patient with severe ID, autistic features, neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, as well as mild facial features.

1496,693, Alteration in synaptic genes NRXN1 and NLGN4 may predispose to neurological syndromes,P05.113,,"Neurexins and neuroligins are proteins functionally connected by interac tion in synaptic network formation and maitenance. According to recent studies alteration in NRXN1 (2p16.3) and NLGN4 (Xp22.3) genes can pre dispose to the wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorder including autism, intellectual disability, speech and language de lay, hypotonia and schizophrenia. NRXN1 as one of the largest known human genes (1,1 Mb) tends to frequent intragenic alterations. Whole genome ge notyping was performed using the Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1.We present 3 children of comparable age (5 6 year old), having different size of microdeletion in isoform alpha1 NRXN1 gene (40 360 kb ) and slightly different phenotype. All children had mild to moderate mental retardation, two of them had speech delay and anxiosity, hypotonia and facial dysmor phism. Two of detected deletions were intronic, the third deletion covered exones 1 to 11 of NRXN1. As the deletion in the NRXN1 may not be fully penetrant, we examine also parental DNA. Microduplication (300 kb) spanning the exones 1,2 and 3 of NLGN4 gene was found in 22 year old patient with hyperkinetic syndrome, attention failure, but without mental retardation. The same duplication was detected in clinically normal mother and maternal cousin with autism. Thanks to this family examination prenatal array diagnosis in a new preg nancy could be provided.

It is characterized by developmental regression, acquired mi crocephaly, loss of purposeful hand use and speech, stereotypic hand mo vements, autistic features, gait apraxia, breathing anomalies, and seizures. Mutations in other genes have been identified in early onset seizure variant (CDKL5) and congenital variant (FOXG1) of Rett syndrome. We report the results of molecular analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 genes in patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features from Czech Republic. MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing of coding regions and exon/intron boundaries. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions in all three genes were analy zed by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. We identified MECP2 mutations in 65 out of 86 patients with classic Rett syndrome (76%). 20 patients with Rett syndrome variants were initially screened for MECP2 mutations and 6 MECP2 mutations were identified (30%). The subsequent analysis of CDKL5 gene in patients with early onset seizure variant revealed mutations in 2 cases (6,7%). No mutation has been identified in FOXG1 gene in the patients with congenital variant of Rett syn drome.

1501,706, Characterization of novel âde novoâ mutation in the SLC6A8 gene,P05.127,,"Introduction: Cerebral creatine deficiency is an X linked disorder caused by mutations in the SLC6A8 gene (Xq28). It consists of 13 exons and encodes a protein of 635 amino acids. This disorder causes an increase of creatine le vels in urine and plasma, and urinary creatine/creatinine ratio. The clinical presentation of males affected is mental retardation, expressive speech and language delay, epilepsy, developmental delay and autistic behaviour. Subjects and Methods: An 8 year old male patient presents learning diffi culties, behaviour disorder and epilepsy. An increase of creatine/creatinine ratio, guanidineacetate and glycine levels (plasma and urine) was detected. The 13 exons of the SLC6A8 gene, including the intron exon junctions, were analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction. Results: We detected a 34 pb deletion (c.1016+11_1017 52del34) in intron 6, that was predicted to cause an aberrant splicing into acceptor splice site. At the cDNA level, this mutation produces a 30 pb deletion in exon 7 and a single amino acid insertion (p. K339_S349delinsN). This variant was not detected in the mother and is therefore considered de novo. Discussion: DNA and RNA analysis were necessary to characterize this novel pathogenic mutation. The detected change in the creatine transporter could be responsible for a lower and/or no activity of the protein. Functional stu dies in cultured skin fibroblasts will be necessary to show a deficiency of the creatine transporter function. J. Aguirre Lamban: None. C. Cervera Acedo: None. E. Sarasola: None. L.

Subjects with ASD were recruited through the Korean autism Genetic Study Consortium. Each child was diagnosed as ASD by using the Korean versions of ADOS and ADI R (Lord et al. 1994; Lord et al. 1997).Total 146 patients were genotyped on the Affymetrix 5.0 platform. Geno type data for n,858 sex matched controls were drawn from the Korea As sociation Resource database. Genotype data were filtered for <5% missing ness/sample or /SNP; MAF >0.01; HWE p>0.0001. Cases were verified as unrelated using identity by descent estimation in PLINK v1.07. In order to examine the missing heritability in ASD, we applied genome wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) to 142 case and 842 controls after data filtering. The results identified phenotypic variants of 84.5% (Â±0.313 SE) with affec ted status of ASD, 7.0% (Â±0.027 SE) with topGWASD SNPs (Â± 1mb region) and 81.0%(Â± 0.313 SE) with nonGWASD SNPs. Increase from the genetic variance identified by top GWASD hits region indicates there might be more risk loci to be identified.

1509,733,Large deletion 11q13.3 encompassing SHANK2 in a patient with autism,P06.12,,"autism are characterized by deficits in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviour. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of rare copy number variations in the genetic etiology of ASD particularly those affecting genes involved in the neuronal synaptic complex. Among them, the SHANK gene family consists of three members: SHANK1, SHANK2 and SHANK3, which encode scaffolding pro teins required for formation and function of neuronal synapses. SHANK2 mutations have been associated with ASD and mild intellectual disability.

1509,733,Large deletion 11q13.3 encompassing SHANK2 in a patient with autism,P06.12,,"autism are characterized by deficits in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviour. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of rare copy number variations in the genetic etiology of ASD particularly those affecting genes involved in the neuronal synaptic complex. Among them, the SHANK gene family consists of three members: SHANK1, SHANK2 and SHANK3, which encode scaffolding pro teins required for formation and function of neuronal synapses. SHANK2 mutations have been associated with ASD and mild intellectual disability.

1510,734,Mosaic copy number variation in the autism and schizophrenia brain: providing a basis for a new (mitotic) theory of neuropsychiatric diseases,P06.13,,"A plethora of data on germ line genomic rearrangements in brain disorder including autism and schizophrenia does exist. On the other hand, the con tribution of non heritable genomic alterations to the pathogenesis is hardly appreciated. Here, we have assessed post zygotic autosomal aneuploidy in prefrontal cortex of the diseased and normal brain by molecular cytogenetic techniques (FISH and interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding with DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18). Twel ve autistic, 19 schizophrenic and 27 control samples provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental disorder, University of Maryland and bank of our institute were analyzed. Aneuploidy rate per autosome was 0.3 0.8% in all three cohorts analyzed (0.46%, 0.62% and 0.59%). However, we observed statistically significant increase of chromosome 9 aneuploidy in the autistic brain. In schizophrenia, chromosome 1 and 18 aneuploidy rates were significantly increased. Additionally, we performed array CGH and in silico analysis of our data on genomic rearrangements in childhood neuro developmental disease (124 individuals) and found that CNV burdens in these individuals typically affect two pathways specific for brain cells: cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death. We concluded that somatic genome variation (chromosome specific mosaic aneuploidy) is a non heri table genetic factor contributing to pathogenesis of brain disorder, that is, however, a result of specific CNV burdens. Our data provide a basis for a new (mitotic) theory of neuropsychiatric disease. Supported by the President of the Russian Federation Grant MD 4401.2013.7 and RFBR 12 04 00215 Ð°. I. Y. Iourov: None.

1513,737,Targeted high throughput gene sequencing of the NMDA receptor multi protein complex and high resolution genomic study of 100 families with autism spectrum disorder,P06.17,,"autism is an early childhood neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a significant genetic aetiology and a prevalence currently estimated at 1/100. Epidemiological studies described that ASDs are heterogeneous at both clinical and genetic levels, which has been further illustrated by the large number of loci and genes that have been identified to date (>100). Several biological pathways have been highlighted, particularly the NMDA receptor multiprotein (NRC) complex, affected by copy number variations (CNV) and mutations enriched in NRC proteins encoding genes. We performed a global genetic study of 100 French families including at least 1 individual with ASD, which was included in the research project âNeurophysiological Molecular and Developmental Analysis of the Glutama te Synapse in autism (NMDA autism)â (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).For each family, we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic compa rative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array for mat to identify rare or de novo CNVs; Secondly, a high throughput targeted sequencing of 216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene mutations in our cohort.

Copy number variants (CNVs) have repeatedly been found to cause or pre dispose to autism (ASDs). For diagnostic purposes, we screened 194 patients with ASDs for CNVs using Illumina SNP arrays. In several patients, we also analyzed candidate genes located in inherited deletions to unmask autosomal recessive variants. Three CNVs, a de novo triplication of chromosome 15q11 q12 of paternal origin, a deletion on chromosome 9p24 and a de novo 3q29 deletion, were identified as the cause of the disorder in one patient each. We also identified multiple private or recurrent CNVs, the majority of which were inherited from asymptomatic parents. Finally, an autosomal recessive cause was considered in two pati ents: a homozygous 1p31.1 deletion encompassing PTGER3 was identified in a patient and a rare missense variant in DOCK10 was found in a second patient in association with an inherited deletion that deleted the entire gene. Although highly penetrant CNVs or variants inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion were detected in rare cases, our results mainly support the hypothesis that CNVs contribute to ASDs in association with other CNVs or point variants located elsewhere in the genome.

1524,765,Identification of a genomic homozygous deletion of ZNF277 in a child with SLI,P06.48,,"Specific language impairment (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental dis order in which language abilities are below age expectations, in the absence of explanatory environmental or medical conditions, such as hearing loss, intellectual disability or autism. SLI affects 3 7% of English speaking pre school children. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277 gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autism dis orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277 deletions. We observed an increased frequency of ZNF277 deletions in probands with SLI (6/318, 1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277 in lymphoblastoid cell lines car rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found that, while ZNF277 microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 .

1524,765,Identification of a genomic homozygous deletion of ZNF277 in a child with SLI,P06.48,,"Specific language impairment (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental dis order in which language abilities are below age expectations, in the absence of explanatory environmental or medical conditions, such as hearing loss, intellectual disability or autism. SLI affects 3 7% of English speaking pre school children. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277 gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autism dis orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277 deletions. We observed an increased frequency of ZNF277 deletions in probands with SLI (6/318, 1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277 in lymphoblastoid cell lines car rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found that, while ZNF277 microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 .

1529,843,Genomics of FXT AS (Fragile X associated Tremor Ataxia) mouse brains reveals hallmarks of altered neurodevelopmement and neurodegeneration.,P08.43,,"While FMR1 is silenced in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients carrying the full mutation, its expression is elevated (2 8 fold) in premutated individuals. The se subjects may develop the Fragile X associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and parkinsonism. In addition, people carrying the premutation can be affected by a set of neurological and behavioural disorder during young age. Memory problems have been detected in these patients as well as in the mouse mo del for FXTAS. In those animals, by transcriptome analysis we have shown a profound deregulation of the expression levels of genes involved in learning, memory and autistic behavior, Parkinson disease and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest the presence of a synapthopathy (Zongaro et al., HMG, 2013). Furthermore, we studied gene expression profiles of whole brain ob tained from both young and old FXTASD mice. We observed that in this context different neurodegenerative pathways are involved at different ages. In FXTASD mice, we also studied the expression level of several microRNAs that target FMR1 mRNA and we observed that one them, miR 221, is down regulated at the synapse of young FXTASD mice and in the full brain of the older ones. Interestingly, many of those deregulated mRNAs at the synapse, as well as in whole brain, are target of miR 221. These findings suggest a network regula tion including miRNAs and mRNAs for FMR1 mRNA.

The use of array CGH substantially improves the diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities that are not evident by conventional karyotype. Recently in an extended family with global developmental delay and autistic features, a novel Xq12 q13.3 duplication was identified which contained amongst others TAF1, GJB1 genes .(Kaya et al.2012).The GJB1 gene is associated with morphology of myelin sheath and peripheral neuropathy, while TAF1 has been linked with torsion dystonia 3. We present the clinical and molecular findings in two unrelated patients with Xq13.1 duplication. The first one is a 5 year old boy with truncal hy potonia, low deep tendon reflexes and proximal weakness. The other pati ent is a 16 year old boy with progressive difficulties in walking, tremor and learning disorder, while his mother has an identical positive family history in three deceased males. High resolution 4X180K Agilent arrays used in the study (> 236.000 probes, average resolution of 8.9 Kb) revealed a duplicati on on Xq13.1 (0.423 Mb) containing the TAF1 and GJB1 genes in both pati ents, while the second patient had an additional deletion on 17q21.31 (0.63 Mb) containing KANSL1 gene. To our knowledge this is the second report of the Xq13.1 duplication extending the previously described phenotypic spectrum in that a more serious neurologic entity could be attributed to the TAF1 and GJB1 genes.

The goal of our study is to develop a statistical framework aiming to measure and detect allele specific gene expression (GE) differences from global GE experiments conducted using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Our method for identification of allele specific differential ex pression (ASDE) is based on the likelihood estimation of the observed data depending on the parameter Î (the relative amount of the reference allele with respect to the alternative allele). ASDE was estimated by a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). Only genes with at least two heterozygous sites were selec ted. Currently we tested the method on a total of 7 mantle cell lymphoma samples (MCL), 12 muscle cell samples (MC) and 15 lymphoblastoid cell li nes samples (LCL).

1593,1369,Detection of allele specific gene expression on next generation sequencing data,P15.06,,"of Life and Reproduction Sciences,University of Verona, Verona, Italy, 2Dept. of Biotechnology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy, 3Dept. of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. Some studies observed that variation of gene expression between alleles is common, and this variation may contribute to human variability of several traits. The goal of our study is to develop a statistical framework aiming to measure and detect allele specific gene expression (GE) differences from global GE experiments conducted using next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Our method for identification of allele specific differential ex pression (ASDE) is based on the likelihood estimation of the observed data depending on the parameter Î (the relative amount of the reference allele with respect to the alternative allele). ASDE was estimated by a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). Only genes with at least two heterozygous sites were selec ted. Currently we tested the method on a total of 7 mantle cell lymphoma samples (MCL), 12 muscle cell samples (MC) and 15 lymphoblastoid cell li nes samples (LCL). Using an arbitrary threshold of LRT > 250 we observed 15, 22 and 33 ASDE genes for MCL, MC and LCL, respectively, on a total of 10910, 8357 and 13328 expressed genes. For MCL samples we observed 3 and 1 ASDE genes in common with MC and LCL, respectively. No common ASDE genes were observed between MC and LCL. We plan to improve the method to identify haplotypes underlying ASDE, and to investigate the cor relation between ASDE genes and their chromosomal location or specific classes of functionality.

1621,1526,Rare Variant Extensions of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test Detects Associations with Autism Exome Sequence Data,P16.106,,"Many population based rare variant association tests have been developed to analyze sequence data. A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7 gene. Given the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

1640,1811,A rare case of a complete 9p trisomy without autistic features and resulting from a de novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation,J02.03,,"Trisomy 9p is one of the most frequent autosomal anomalies compatible with long survival rate. The phenotype of the 9 p duplication syndrome is clinically recognizable, and phenotype/genotype correlations suggested that the critical region is located on 9p22. We report on a rare case of a tri somy for the whole short arm of chromosome 9 resulting from a de novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation. A 3 year old girl was referred to genetic counselling because of facial dysmorphism, seizures, and moderate mental retardation. MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) was interpreted as normal. Chromosome analysis revealed a 46,XX,der(15)add(15)(p11) karyotype. Parental karyotypes were normal. Thus, we conclude that this chromosomal rearrangement occurred de novo. In order to identify this additional materi al on chromosome 15, we performed array CGH (Nimbelgen Whole genome tiling135K HG18) that showed a duplication of the whole short arm of chro mosome 9. No other imbalances were found elsewhere in the genome. FISH studies performed with whole chromosome 15 and chromosome 9 painting probes confirmed that the chromosomal material added on chromosome 15 derived from 9p. Our observation is unique because the duplication of the whole short arm of chromosome 9 without monosomy of another chromo some and resulting from a de novo unbalanced translocation was never re ported. Our patient had the most common clinical findings of the trisomy 9p syndrome but neither visceral anomalies, nor autistic features.

Most individuals have moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic like beha viour and decreased pain perception. Frequency of the syndrome is equal in males and females while incidence is still unknown. Beside the simple de letion, loss of 22q13.3 can also result from translocation, ring chromosome formation and other less common structural changes affecting the region containing SHANK3 gene on long arm of chromosome 22. The most features of the syndrome thought to be the consequence of loss that specific gene. We present a case of female newborn with Phelan McDermid syndrome. The child was born on term, from first, uncomplicated pregnancy with un remarkable family history. She was initially treated in NICU because of early neonatal infection. Because of congenital hypotonia with mild facial dysmor phic features genetic analysis were performed. The karyotype revealed ring chromosome (22): 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13.3). A fluorescent in situ hybridisa tion analysis was performed, indicating that the deletion encompassed the critical 22q13.3 region. After good clinical evaluation, congenital hypotonia especially with dysmorphic features may be the only indication for genetic evaluation, so we suggest importance of genetic review in cases like this.

1683,2200, Investigation of IL23R gene variants in Romanian ankylosing spondylitis patients,J16.66,,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic rheumatic disease characterized by inflammation in the spine and sacroiliac joints. Interleukin 23 (IL23) is an important cytokine that acts through the signaling complex IL12Rb1 IL23R. Recent studies have reported the associations of IL23R gene single nucleoti de polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of ASD in Caucasian populations. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of IL23R gene SNPs with the risk of ASD in Romanian population. Methods: Nine SNPs mapping to IL23R gene (rs11805303, rs7530511, rs10489629, rs2201841, rs11465804, rs11209026,Arg381Gln, rs1343151, rs11209032, rs1495965) were genotyped in 168 consecutive ASD patients and 161 healthy controls of Romanian ethnicity using the Sequenom Mas sARRAY platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) and/or TaqMan assays (Ap plied Biosystems, USA). Statistical analyses were performed with PLINK and Haploview softwares. Results: We found no association between ASD and individual SNPs in IL23R gene. The combined analysis of the studied SNPs revealed the association between ASD and the 3 marker haplotype GCG rs11209026/rs1343151/ rs11209032 (30% in patients versus 38% in controls, p,0.02, OR 0.69).

Aim: autism or autism are a lifelong neurode velopmental disorder and Î± few cases of chromosomal abnormalities are found by conventional cytogenetic techniques, while the microarray Compa rative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) allows the identification of submicroscopic genomic rearrangements. This study describes the ap plication of array CGH, as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients with autism or ASD. Materials Methods: During the last 4 years, 88/480 patients were studied with autism or ASD of unknown aetiology but with normal previous con ventional karyotype and other genetic tests. High resolution 4X180K and 1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51). CNVs detected were in loci at high risk for autism: 2q37.2, 2p16.3, 5p15.32p14.3, 7p22.3, 10q26.3, 12q24.22q24.3, 15q11.2q11.3, 16p11.2, 18q22.3q23, 21q22.3, Î§q21.31.

High resolution 4X180K and 1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51). CNVs detected were in loci at high risk for autism: 2q37.2, 2p16.3, 5p15.32p14.3, 7p22.3, 10q26.3, 12q24.22q24.3, 15q11.2q11.3, 16p11.2, 18q22.3q23, 21q22.3, Î§q21.31. Genes associated with autism or ASD which were identi fied included: NRXN1, SHANK3, DOCK8, ZNF92, ASMT , HSFX1, KCNH7, CHR FAM7A, CHRNA7, KCND2, CNTNAP3, ÎÎÎÎ, MAOB, STS, VCX. Conclusions: In patients with autism or ASD and non syndromic phenotype, array CGH analysis is mandatory to detect possible submicroscopic chromo somal abnormalities. For the family, positive results of array CGH, provides comprehensive genetic counseling, which includes determining the patientâs prognosis and planning antenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies.

A total of 12 sSMCs (28,6%) originated from chromosome 15: inv dup(15)(q11.1) markers were detected in 9 cases (1 mosaic) with normal phenotype; inv dup(15)(q13) sSMCs , contained PWS/ASD critical regionâ in 3 cases with abnormal phenotype. sSMCs derived from chromosome 22 were detected in 13 cases (31%): inv dup(22)(q11.1) markers were detected in 8 cases (2 mosaic) with normal phenotype; inv dup(22)(q11.2) â in 3 cases (2 mosaic) (cat eye syndrome); der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) â in 1 case (Emanuel syndrome); inv dup (22)(:p11.1âqter)â in 1 case. sSMC originating from chromosome 21 inv dup(21)(q11.1) was detected in one case. sSMCs as the product of 3:1 segregation of a reciprocal translocation were characterized in 2 cases. sSMCs associated with Palli ster Killian syndrome were detected in 3cases, with i(18)(p10) syndrome â in 4 cases. Small marker ring chromosomes were identified in 3 cases: one case r(20) and two cases r(16). Neocentromere sSMCs were revealed in 2 cases: unbalanced inv dup(8)(p23) and balanced r(1)(p13p21).

We previously showed that increased dosage of methyl CpG binding prote in 2 (MeCP2) leads to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder in males, desi gnated as the MECP2 duplication syndrome (MIM#300260). The increased dosage of MeCP2 is the result of a copy number gain at Xq28, including the MECP2 gene and results in severe to profound neurodevelopmental delay with onset at birth, limited or absent speech, hypotonia, epilepsy, autistic behavior and motor dysfunction. We developed induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome carrying different duplication sizes, to study the impact of increased MePC2 dosage in human neurons. Differentiation of these iPSCs into neurons of cortical identity sho wed modulation in the expression of progenitor genes like BLBP and FOXG1 and cortical genes like RELN, CTIP2, TBR1 and VGLUT. Cortical neurons derived from Mecp2dup iPSCs had more synapses, and altered network synchronization as well as dendritic complexity. Next, we tested a series of epigenetic drugs for the ability to rescue neuronal defects and validated two HDAC inhibitors as potential clinical candidates. Our model recapitulates early stages of the human MECP2 duplication syndrome and represents a promising cellular tool to facilitate therapeutic drug screening for severe neurodevelopmental disorder .",2014.0,,"S.

1717,192, Efficient molecular diagnosis of Intellectual Disability: targeted High throughput exon sequencing of 217 ID genes detects causative mutations in at least 26 of 106 tested patients,C18.2,,"Intellectual disability is a major public health problem, characterized by an extreme genetic heterogeneity, with several hundred genes implicated in monogenic forms with or without autism, complicating molecular dia gnosis. In patients without evocative syndromic forms the offer is limited to Fragile X testing and array CGH, leaving most cases undiagnosed. Trio Exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, but re mains costly for general implementation. We thus tested targeted exon se quencing of 217 genes previously implicated in X linked ID, or in autosomal dominant or recessive forms in which ID is the major clinical concern. We analyzed 106 patients (mostly males and sporadic cases) with molecularly undiagnosed ID. One third of them harbored autistic features. We identified causative mutations in 26 patients: sixteen in X linked ge nes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD , FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1 , IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA, MECP2, SLC9A6 , SLC16A2, PHF8), 10 de novo in autosomal genes (DYRK1A , GRIN1 , MED13L , TCF4, RAI1 , SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 ). We detected likely causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3 for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions. The identification of mutations in 25 29% of patients proves the diagnostic efficiency of this strategy, higher than CGH and comparable to trio exome sequencing at lesser cost.

Anophthalmia/microphthalmia (A/M) is a genetically heterogeneous birth defect for which the etiology remains unknown in more than 50% patients. A/M can occur without other structural eye defects (simplex A/M), or can be present with other ocular findings (complex A/M), such as anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). We used exome sequencing (ACE ExomeTM, Personalis, Inc., 18 exomes; UCSF Genomics Core, 20 exomes; 6 were run twice) to se quence DNA from 32 children with A/M or other developmental eye defects for pathogenic mutations. In 19 patients with simplex A/M, we identified mutations in STRA6 (1 patient), RARB (1 patient; p. Arg387Cys), GDF6 (1 pa tient; p. Ala249Glu) and OTX2 (1 patient; p.

1759,685, S Intellectual disability and autistic behavior due to de novo microduplication of Xq28 involving part of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. Is this a plausible explanation?,P08.09,,", Bari, Italy, 4Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ di Milano, Bari, Italy, 5Servizio di Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ Cattolica del Sacro Cuore,, Roma, Italy, 6Istituto di Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ Cattolica del Saro Cuore, Roma, Italy, 7Istituto di Anatomia Umana e Biologia Cellulare, UniversitÃÂ Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy. FRAXE is an X linked form of intellectual disability characterized by mild to moderate cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic behavior. The folate sensitive fragile site FRAXE is located in Xq28 appro ximately 600 kb distal to the fragile X syndrome fragile site (FRAXA) and harbors an unstable GCC triplet repeat adjacent to a CpG island in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR (untranslated region) of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. The disorder results from amplification and methylation of the GCC repeats and consequence silen cing of AFF2. Although chromosome abnormalities (mostly deletions) that disrupt AFF2 have been reported with mild moderate intellectual disability, microduplication of Xq28 that partially involved AFF2 has not been descri bed as a potential cause of FRAXE. We performed clinical and molecular cha racterization of patient with 301 kb interstitial de novo duplication at Xq28 (chrX:147ÃÂ490ÃÂ437 147ÃÂ791ÃÂ737bp)(GRCh37/hg19). This genomic mutati on leads to the duplication of part of 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR region of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene which could be inactivated due to this genomic change. Namely, duplication of this segment potentially could have the same effects as amplification and methylation of an unstable GCC triplet repeats. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are perfor ming experiments aimed to study genic expression/metilation. As our pati ent had cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity and mild dysmor phism, we predict that partial duplication of AFF2 in our patient could be the cause of his phenotype.",2014.0,,"N.

Currently over 90 XLID genes have been found to be implicated in XLID. The host cell factor C1 (HCFC1) gene is located on chro mosome Xq28 and is a member of the host cell factor family. A mutation in HCFC1 has been previously found to be associated with XLID in a non syndromic XLID family namely MRX3. Currently very few studies exist that further confirm HCFC1 as an XLID gene. We present an XLID family with two affected sons having mild intellectual disability epilepsy and no congenital abnormalities. Fragile X analysis and array CGH using a chromosome X exon specific array were performed and revealed normal results. Subsequently, next generation whole exome se quencing analysis for both brothers was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 following Agilent SureSelect sample preparation (20x coverage). Reads were aligned using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner and the Genome Analysis Tool Kit. Autosome variants and variants present in dbSNP 135 were filtered out. Analysis of rare X chromosome variants present in both brothers revealed a non synonymous mutation in exon 4 of HCFC1 (p. Ala897Val). This mutation is located within GABP2 and ZBTB17 binding domains.

Current evidence suggests it is involved in neuronal development and maturation, and it has recently been highlighted as potentially playing a key role in the evolution of the human brain. Clinically, NPAS3 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and numerous studies have supported this association. In addition, several cases of learning disabilities in patients with disruptions of this gene are reported, but this association remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present four unrelated individuals with small copy number vari ants (CNVs) within NPAS3: two intragenic duplications and two intragenic deletions. These CNVs range between 111 460kb in length and encompass exonic sequences within the NPAS3 gene. All four patients had variable de grees of developmental delay, and three had subtle distinctive facial features. Two patients also had macrosomia and macrocephaly, while the other two had autistic features and behaviour issues, including psychosis in one indivi dual. In contrast, CNVs involving exonic sequences in NPAS3 have only been seen in one of over 19,000 controls. In summary, these four cases support an association between NPAS3 and developmental delay.

We replicated this genetic association in an Italian population (409 cases, 723 controls), identifying a protective signal, corresponding to a GCC mi crosatellite in the PRKCA promoter (P,0.033, OR,0.12, 95%CI,0.015 0.94), and a risk haplotype in intron 3 (P,7.7*10 4; OR,1.57, 95%CI,1.24 1.99, meta analysis P,1.1*10 12). Expression experiments demonstrated that the protective signal is associated with PRKCA promoter variants confer ring higher expression levels of the gene. Minigene based transfection ex periments proved that the risk signal is driven by an ins/del polymorphism (rs35476409/rs61762387) influencing, with an hnRNP H dependent me chanism, the skipping of a PRKCA alternative exon. Studies performed on RNA extracted from different cell lines and human tissues evidenced a complex pattern of alternatively spliced (AS) PRKCA isoforms, which are modulated by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and display a preferential association with the use of alternative po lyadenilation sites. MS patients showed significantly decreased PRKCA levels (49 cases, 61 controls; P<1*10 4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a conco mitant unbalance in the relative abundance of its mRNA variants. One of these alternative transcripts is predicted to encode a truncated PKCÃÂ± that, when overexpressed, aberrantly localizes to the plasma membrane and/or in cytoplasmic clusters.

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autism. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndrome in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval. Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan ces. We selected a large and unique panel of WBS and 7dup ASD patients and derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the most advanced reprogramming technology based on synthetic mRNAs.

Mutations in the NR2A and NR2B subunits encoded by the genes GRIN2A and GRIN2B have been associated with different phenotypes of intellectual disability (ID). Mutations in GRIN2A were known to cause unspecific ID and epilepsy as well as other neurodevelopmental disorder, whereas mutations in GRIN2B have mainly been associated with autism but not seizures. We show for the first time that mutations of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor cause different and specific epilepsy phenotypes. NR2 muta tions are involved in benign Rolandic epilepsy, the most frequent childhood epilepsy as well as in a variety of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathi es, such as Landau Kleffner and West syndrome. Furthermore, we demon strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations.

1829,1048, S Mosaic deletion of 18q in lymphocytes represents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians and underlines the importance of CMA testing in children with ID,P11.099,,"We report on a 2ÃÂ½ year old boy with mental retardation, muscular hypoto nia, deafness with atresia of the external auditory canal and a preauricular tag on the right side. The boy was referred for global intellectual disabili ty with very limited speech capabilities and autistic traits. The pregnancy had been uneventful except for an emergency Cesarean section because of breech position. Birth measurements were normal, however, the baby was hypotonic and exhibited difficulties in feeding. At physical examination at the age of 2ÃÂ½ years measurements were still normal but we noted discrete dysmorphic features: long eye lashes, broad mouth with cupid bow lips, small fingers with broad short endphalanges, clinodactyly of toes V on both sides, tender translucent skin, fine hair and cryptorchidism on the right side. On the MRI at the age of 2 years delayed myelinisation was visible. As the atresia of the external auditory canal is typical for a deletion 18q we performed a karyotype on lymphocytes which was first reported with no pathological findings. The array (2.7 Affymetrix SNP oligo array platform) analysis revealed a de letion in mosaic form of 20.7 Mb of the long arm of chromosome 18, encom passing 69 genes in total. The mosaic was confirmed with FISH, which also revealed that the mosaic ratio in this case was 13% in cultivated blood and 81% in buccal swab. Reevaluating the karyotype the deletion was visible.

The platform of choice to detect genome wide CNVs has traditionally been microarray (including SNP arrays that can also detect copy neutral LOH regions); however, since samp les have often undergone sequencing to discover pathogenic sequence vari ants, it is desirable to exploit these data to also detect CNVs. Various methods have been proposed to detect CNVs from NGS data, but little information is available which compare the success of these approaches to orthogonal me thods. Using a large data set of constitutional samples from an autism cohort that have been subjected to both whole exome sequencing (WES) and to a genome wide SNP microarray, we compare the ability to detect CNVs bet ween these platforms. Several algorithms for CNV detection from the WES data are examined, and the results are compared with an established HMM based method for detection of CNVs from the microarray platform.",2014.0,,"L.

HLA B*27 gene, located on short arm of sixth chromosome, have significant role in sus ceptibility of ASD disease. The predisposition of ASD disease is higher in HLA B*27 positive people than HLA B*27 negative ones. Also, there are some pa tients who have both ASD disease and MEFV gene mutation. In our study, as sociation of MEFV gene mutations have been analysed in HLA B*27 positive and negative patients who diagnosed as AS, and HLA B*27 negative healthy controls. 80 patients including HLA B*27 positive 36 male and 14 female ASD patients, HLA B*27 negative 11 female and 19 male ASD patients have been studied in the research. 50 healthy controls including 17 female and 33 male HLA B*27 negative healthy individuals have been studied. HLA B*27 allele of both patient and control groups were determined by PCR SSP method. Pyrosequencing method was used for detection of MEFV gene mutations. HLA B*27 positive patient group and healthy control group were compared in terms of MEFV gene exon 2 and 10 mutations. Frequency MEFV gene exon 2 and 10 mutation is determined statistically higher in HLA B*27 positive patient group than healthy control group (p, 0,012) We suggest that MEFV gene mutations may have a role in etiopathogenesis of HLA B*27 positive ASD disease.

Several biological pathways have been high lighted, particularly the excitatory synapse, affected by copy number varia tions (CNV) and enrichment in mutations in genes belonging to the NMDA receptor complex (NRC). We performed a global genetic study of 100 French families including at least 1 individual with autism, who were included in the research project (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).Our project aimed to evaluate both the contribution of CNV in ASD, and secondly the presence of mutations in the NRC complex. For each family, we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array format to identify rare or de novo CNVs. In parallel, a high throughput targeted sequencing of 216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex (179) was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene mutations in our cohort. The first results of our study allowed us to characterize candidates and li kely pathogens genetic alterations in at least 10% of patient. We have found mutations or CNV in genes encoding receptors (NLGN4X, GRM5 ), and in cy tosolic (UPF3B), nuclear (MACROD2), and synaptic (NXPH3) proteins.

By examining de novo and rare inherited single nucleotide and structural variations in genes previously reported to be associated with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorder, we found that more than two thirds of the affected siblings car ried different ASD relevant mutations. These siblings with discordant muta tions tended to demonstrate more clinical variability than those who shared a risk variant. Our study emphasizes that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in ASD, necessitating the use of WGS to delineate all genic and non genic susceptibility variants in research and in clinical diagnostics.

2019,156," Chromosomal contacts connect loci associated with autism, BMI and head circumference phenotypes",C13.3,,"We identified the cis and trans acting long range chromosomal contacts of five genes located within the 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 copy number variants (CNVs). Its deletion is one of the most frequent known etiologies of autism, while this deletion and reciprocal duplication are associated with mirror phenotypes on BMI, head circumference and brain volume. We observed complex chromatin looping between genes located in the proximal 600kb BP4 BP5 and those mapping to the distal 16p11.2 220kb BP2 BP3 region, two loci separated by 650kb, successfully confir med by reciprocal 4C, FISH, Hi C and associations between active regula tory regions. Phenotyping of 137 unrelated carriers of distal 16p11.2 220 kb BP2 BP3 deletion and duplication showed that these CNVs are similarly associated with ASD and reciprocal impacts on BMI and HC. Our results indicate that chromosomal contactsÃ¢ÂÂ maps could uncover func tionally and clinically related genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, loci chromatin contacted by our selected viewpoints are enriched for ASD genes (OR,2.15, P,1.65e 08). Furthermore, we uncovered 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 chromatin loops with (i) the 1q21.1 cytoband, whose deletions and du plications were previously linked to micro and macrocephaly, respectively; (ii) PTEN, mutations of which are associated with a macrocephalic form of ASD; and (iii) the 2p15 cytoband. We enrolled 35 carriers of 2p15 16.1 de letion and duplication and showed that they similarly display mirror pheno types on HC and weight. Finally, we observe that genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 BP4 BP5 CNV carriers are concomitantly modified in their chromatin interactions, suggesting that disruption of chromatin interplays participates in the ob served phenotypes.

2032,204, ST AG1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for a new cohesinopathy with intellectual disability and characteristic facial features in four unrelated individuals,C21.2,,"Cohesinopathies are rare disorder arising from a dysfunction in the cohesin pathway, which enables chromosome segregation and proper cell division. So far, seven genes from this pathway have been reported in human disease. Five of them are involved in autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X linked (SMC1A and HDAC8) Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and two of them in autosomal recessive Roberts (ESCO2) and Warsaw Breakage syndrome (DDX11). All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which, along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3 males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency. Three had history of intrauterine growth retardation, two with prenatal onset microcephaly, one with post natal growth retardation. One individual had epilepsy, two had autistic features. The four patients shared common facial features, with widely spaced incisors, thin eyebrows, and high nasal bridge. The mechanism for haploinsufficiency was a small deletion encompassing STAG1 diagnosed by array CGH in two individuals, an intragenic deletion in STAG1 found by whole genome analysis in one individual, and a missense heterozygous mutation (c.641A>G) revealed by exome analysis in the last patient. All the variants were shown to be de novo. This series provides evi dence that STAG1 haploinsufficiency leads to a new cohesinopathy with a clinically recognizable phenotype.",2015.0,,"D.

The mo noallelic maternal expression of CDKN1C is under the control of the IC2 imprinting centre through the antisense non coding KCNQ1OT1 transcript. The protein comprises three functional domains including from the N to the C terminus a CDK binding, a PAPA and a PCNA domain. CDKN1C mutations underlie the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) ac counting for 10% of sporadic cases and up to 40% of familial cases. Here we report on the clinical and molecular characterization of ten BWS families, negative for the known 11p15 (epi)genetic alterations and 2 prena tal cases diagnosed because of omphalocele. Twelve distinct mutations were detected, including 6 stop, 3 frameshift, two missense mutations and one complex mutation, seven of which yet unreported.

TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed. Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression. Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism. Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples.

2158,687, De novo 19p13.2 microdeletion encompassing the part of NFIX gene in a girl with Sotos like phenotype,PM08.02,,"19p13.2 microdeletion is a rare genomic disorder. To date, less than ten cases was described so far in the literature. This chromosomal syndrome manifests in developmental delay/intellectual impairment, postnatal over growth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphy, slender habitus, advanced bone age, and scoliosis. Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent. Very similar phenotype is observed in the Sotos syndrome 2 (MIM #614753) that is caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions of the NFIX gene located on chromosome 19p13.2.Here, we report on the case of a 7 year old girl referred to genetic counse ling because of psychomotor retardation, speech delay and dysmorphic fea tures (macrocephaly, long/narrow and triangular face, high forehead, fron tal bossing, downslanting palpebral fissures, dysplastic low set ears, small nose, flat philtrum, micrognathia). At the examination, behavioral problems (anxiety, tantrums, autoaggression), seizures, and poor coordination were noted. Skeletal anomalies (advanced bone age, joint laxity, slender hands with long fingers, abnormal setting of the lower limbs), strabismus, hypero pia as well as constipations and abdominal pain were also diagnosed. Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a de novo 158.18 kb (the smallest so far) deletion of 19p13.2 region (chr19:13,020,206 13,178,390; hg19) encompassing seven genes; three of them (NFIX, DAND5 and CALR) could be the candidate genes for the genotype phenotype rela tionship. This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13.2 microdeletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region.

2167,708, A novel HCN1 mutation not associated with epileptic encephalopathy,PS08.23,,"B. Rossi Hospital, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity. Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorder. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits. Here we report the case of a 9 year old girl with a Rett like phenotype, cha racterized by intellectual disability, hand stereotypies, absent speech, nega tive brain MRI and EEG data and no history of epilepsy. By NGS approach, with the use of a targeted intellectual disability/epilepsy gene panel, we found the girl to carry a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the HCN1 gene. This mutation is located in the glycine tyrosine glycine (GYG) motif, which constitutes the ion selectivity filter typical of K+ permeable channels.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects. We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase. This innovative strategy to collect information on natural history and co morbidities of rare monogenic forms of ID/autism will promote familiesÃ¢ÂÂ empowerment and hopefully impact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ care.

Copy number variations (CNV) in RBFOX1, also known as A2BP1, have been associated with human neurodevelopmental disease, including autism. This gene, spanning 1.7 MB on chromosome 16p13.3, is one of the largest genes in the human genome, responsible for encoding splicing regulatory factors, specifically expressed in neurons and muscles, and having a regula tory action in alternative splicing of a large tissue specific gene networks. Materials and methods: Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, using an Agi lent 4x180K platform, was performed in 1200 patients with mental retarda tion, autism and congenital anomalies. Results: In our cohort, we identified 6 cases with intragenic deletions in RB FOX1, 4 of them with additional CNV in other chromosomes. These CNVs are located at 16p13.3, extended in a 1,2Mb region between 6,087,983 7 ,207,012 (GRCh37/hg19), which corresponds to intronic regions in 5 out of 6 patients. Five of these patients have an inherited deletion, from an unaffec ted progenitor, and one has an unknown inheritance pattern. Conclusions: The phenotypes of all these children have in common, as wide ly described, neurological alterations.

2192,774, Expression profile of circulating miRNAs in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),PS09.017,,"Introduction: ASD is a genetically complex disorder, highly heterogeneous and with unclear etiology. In this study we addressed the possible contri bution of epigenetic factors to ASD etiology, focusing on deregulated Mi croRNAs (miRNAs) expression. miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. miRNAs are thought to be released from pathological tissues to plasma in illness situations, and the strong correlation between circulating and tissue miRNAs indicates that plasma miRNAs may be useful disease biomarkers. Methods: miRNA plasma profiles were obtained for patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), essentially disruptive beha vior, language delay and psychomotor delay. Patients were all male, with a mean developmental coefficient of 92ÃÂ±18, and no obvious dysmorphisms. Exiqon human miRNome PCR panels (testing 752 miRNAs) were used for miRNA profiling. Results: We identified 50 miRNAs differentially expressed in ASD vs NDD. Notably, of the 10 miRNAs with higher fold change (increased 2.5 3.3X), 8 miRNAs had a target gene in common, MMP16. This gene is expressed at high levels in the brain, and a balanced de novo translocation in a ASD pati ent involving MMP16 has previously been described. Conclusions: This is the first study of circulating miRNA profiles comparing patients with ASD and other NDDs. The preliminary results suggest that miRNA profilling may eventually improve differential diagnosis.

To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected: deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1 (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83, RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

To elucidate a putative contribution of genetic SHANK3 variants to the etiology of SCZ, we sequenced the gene in 500 affected individuals and compared the sequencing results to ancestral ly matched controls. Novel SHANK3 missense variants were identified in 1.6 % of the screened individuals, three of which were predicted as deleterious by at least two different algorithms. We identified association of 5 genetic variants, with study wide significance(P<0.001). Combined with previous studies, the rare G>V variant was found in 4 out of 1543 SCZ patients and in 4 out of 2147 individuals with autism, but not in 9315 controls. We conclude that the SHANK3 gene harbors different genetic variations predisposing to SCZ, ranging from common and uncommon va riants torare deleterious missense mutations.

The cause of IDs is an aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities. At present, there are eight clinically well recognized IDs. Be cause of high variability of clinical phenotype and molecular alterations, the exact prevalence of IDs is not known. Methods: In this study we retrospectively reviewed records of all Estonian patients with molecularly confirmed ID diagnosis during the period 1998 2014.Results: A total of 52 individuals with IDs were identified. 46% (24) of them had Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), 23% (12) Angelman syndrome (AS), 13%(7) Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), 12% (6) Silver Russell syndrome (SRS), 2% (1) Temple syndrome (TS), 2% (1) pseudohypopa rathyroidism Ib (PHP Ib) and 2% (1) transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). No cases of Kagami Ogata syndrome have been found. The age of diagnosis varied between 0.03 and 83 years. All cases of TS, PHP Ib, TNDM and the most cases of SRS and BWS were diagnosed in the last 4 years due to new diagnostic tests.

Microdeletions occurred between BP1 and BP2 of 15q11.2 Prader Willi/Angelman critical region are described in literature as the novel Burnside Butler syndrome. There are four highly conserved and unimprinted genes within the 15q11.2(BP1 BP2) region: TUBGCP5,CYFIP1,NIPA1, and NIPA2 . TUBGCP5 is expressed in subthalamic nuclei, NIPA1 , NIPA2 and CYFIP1 are expressed in central nervous system. Haploinsufficiency for TUBGCP5, NIPA1, NIPA2 and CYFIP1, without Prader Willi syndrome, can explain some clinical features as delayed motor and speech development, dysmorphism and behavioural problems. We describe a case of a 5 old boy with a BP1 BP2 microdeletion of 443kb spanning these four genes. He had developmental delay, awkwardness of motor skills, behavioural pro blems, speech and language impairment and was referred for autism clinical suspicion. No dysmorphism was observed in the patient.aCGH showed a 15q11.2 microdeletion flanked by BP1 and BP2.MLPA analysis, performed on the trios, confirmed the microdeletion in the patient and his normal mother.

Results: In 91 out of 410 patients (24.8%) 98 microrearrangements were detected by array CGH among which 8 were disease causing and 90 vari ants of uncertain significance, potentially pathogenic. Groups of patients with overlapping microrearrangements were identified and their neuropsy chological profiles were systematically analysed (language, memory, atten tion, executive functions, visuo spatial skills).

2598,141,A Complex Mutational Spectrum of Structural Variation Contributing to Autism,C15.1,,"Recent genomic studies of autism have relied upon genome wide characterization of coding mutations using whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variants (CNV) using chromosomal microarray (CMA). In ASD, these efforts have revealed a strong associati on with de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and CNVs segments that alter the dosage of genes under evolutionary constraint. Unfortunately, the impact of balanced and complex structural variation (SV), which also repre sent LoF variation, remains uncharacterized in ASD and other human disea se studies. Here, we explored the full mutational spectrum of SV contribu ting to ASD by integrating large insert, short insert and synthetic long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies with CMA in 307 idiopathic ASD probands and 120 family members from the Simons Simplex Collec tion. Analyses revealed a diverse landscape of SVs beyond canonical CNVs, including inversions, insertions, and translocations. We also categorized 13 distinct subclasses of recurrent complex SVs and demonstrate that each ge nome sequenced harbored at least one such large complex rearrangement (~5 kb resolution). We identified 26 de novo SVs likely contributing to ASD, 50% of which were cryptic to detection by previous technologies on the se same samples.

Few mutations in POGZ were reported in recent exome studies. However, these studies did not provide detailed clinical in formation, leaving the pathogenicity and a clear phenotypic definition of the POGZ patient unknown. Patients and Methods: We collected the clinical and molecular data of 25 individuals with disruptive mutations in POGZ identified by diagnostic who le exome, whole genome, or targeted sequencing of 5,223 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorder (ID primarily) or by targeted resequencing of this locus in 12,041 individuals with ASD and/or ID. In parallel, we utili zed a Drosophila knockdown model of the POGZ orthologue row to provide further support for the importance of POGZ in cognitive function. Results: We defined common phenotypic features of POGZ patients, inclu ding variable levels of developmental delay and more severe speech and language delay compared to motor delay and coordination issues. We also identified significant associations with vision problems, microcephaly, hy peractivity, a tendency to obesity and feeding difficulties. In addition, we found that downregulation of row expression, specifically in neurons, leads to deficits in habituation, a form of non associative learning that is highly relevant for both ID and ASD. Conclusion: Combined, these data underscore the pathogenicity of loss of function mutations in POGZ and define a novel POGZ related syndrome.

For example, the long intergenic RNA (lincRNA) MALAT1 has been shown to regulate cancer tu mor growth in bone and has been identified as a potential therapeutic tar get in osteosarcoma*. As part of the GENCODE project, the HAVANA team at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to identify and manually annotate all lncRNAs in the human and mouse genomes. Our most recent release for ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

Historically, lncRNA annotation has been supported by ESTs and cD NAs submitted to INSDC databases. Recent developments in next generation sequencing technology provide a huge amount of transcriptome data, ho wever, this data needs to be handled carefully if it is to be used for building high quality gene annotation**. We will discuss the incorporation of public RNAseq and SLRseq datasets into our annotation pipeline to identify novel loci and describe our PacBio Capture seq pipeline to extend loci to their full length and identify alternative splicing (AS). Additionally, we will show how we use PhyloCSF and Mass Spectrometry data to check coding potential in lncRNA loci and confirm their non coding status, or update their annotation. Combining multiple public and bespoke next generation data sets allows us to identify novel lncRNA loci, extend and add ASD transcripts to existing loci and validate their non coding annotation in an effort to provide a more de tailed picture of the human non coding transcriptome. *PubMedID 25504755 **http://www.gencodegenes.org/rgasp/ C24 Rare disease Gene Discoverie",2016.0,,"M.

Recently, the introduction of next generation sequencing allowed the analysis of all three ASD genes in a single step. Despite that, the total mutation detection rate has been estimated bet ween 55 80%.

Results: Analysis of variants within ASD genes identified pathogenic muta tions in all families. In Family 1, we identified an homozygous 24 bp in frame deletion in COL4A3 (p.

We show that 2q37 deletions can be common in children with ID, autism, congenital malformations tending to a frequency as high as 1%. Therefore, one can suggest that 2q37.3 deletions are likely to be more com mon among these children than previously recognized.

2660,676, Diagnosis of intellectual disability by sequencing all genes known in pathology,P08.42,,"The etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) are very heterogeneous. For this reason, exome sequencing is increasingly used in the diagnosis of ID. We sequenced 151 index cases with the Illumina TruSight One panel which targets the coding sequences of 4813 genes involved in human pathology. Our aim was a diagnostic yield close to exome sequencing but less expensi ve. All patients had a negative diagnostic work up before sequencing inclu ding chromosome microarray analysis. A definitive or likely diagnosis was found for 42 index cases (28%) in 39 different genes: 30 were autosomal dominant (de novo or with a low mo saicism in one parent), 6 were autosomal recessive, 6 were X linked. We also made 4 partial diagnoses which do not explain the whole phenotype. Besi des, 10 variants were classified as variants of unknown significance. Finally, we identified 7 incidental findings irrelevant with the indication. In our series, 56 patients had autism and ID with normal motor develop ment and autistic regression. In these patients, we achieved a unique dia gnosis (1.7%); therefore our diagnostic yield was 42% among our 95 pati ents with ID and no autism. We had also 35% diagnoses in our 40 patients with ID and epilepsy. Overall, this technique provides a significant advance in the diagnostic strat egy of patients with ID. However, it highlights the need to better characterize its clinical indications. Mostly, our experience suggests that ID as part of an autism is currently not a good indication due to the supposed multifactorial nature of this pathology.

Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members. Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website. This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare disease affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

2667,696, Mosaic Xq26,P08.64,,"Introduction. Recurrent mosaic duplications are exclusive in the available literature. This is especially the case in terms of clinically relevant X chro mosome duplications in females. However, a growing amount of reports on somatic genome variations causing intellectual disability and congenital malformations allows speculations that mosaic (sub)chromosomal rear rangements might be more common and clinically relevant than previously recognized. Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping using SNP/oligonucleotide microarray (resolution: >1 kbp) was performed in a cohort of 402 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformati ons. Results. Four girls (~1%) have exhibited mosaic duplications spanning Xq26.2q26.3.The age varied from 1 year 1 month to 6 years. Shared features included intellectual disability/developmental delay, microcephaly, broad phyltrum and wide nasal bridge, long lashes, ptosis; one patient demonstrated autistic features. The overlapping region for all duplications included 8 genes: GPC3, MIR19B2 , MIR106A, PHF6, HPRT1, MIR503, MIR424, PLAC1. Although non mosaic duplication in this region involving genes PHF6 and HPRT1 has been described in the literature previously, the lack of phenotypic resemblance to the detected cases and an original bioinformatics analysis allow the specu lation that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 might be a new chromosomal syndrome associated with intellectual disability and congenital malforma tions. Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 are relatively common in children with intellectual disability, autism, epi lepsy and/or congenital malformations. Furthermore, our findings demon strate the possibility that mosaic chromosomal rearrangements can be a cause for a new chromosomal syndrome.

2669,704, Characterization of patient with de novo frameshift PUF60 mutation suggests that disruption of this gene is sufficient for most symptoms of Verheij syndrome,P08.72,,"Verheij syndrome (OMIM 615583) is associated with rare de novo 8q24.3 microdeletions. Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60 and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense PUF60 mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60 and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome. We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four nucleotides in PUF60 (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p. I136Tfs*31). The patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60 which may be of key importance for the syndrome. The case illustrates the strength of exome sequencing in deciphering the genetic basis of disease. Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.",2016.0,,"M.

2671,706, Copy number variation in RBFOX1 and DOCK8: Neurodevelopmental disorders or benign variants?,P08.74,,"Deletions and duplications involving the genes RBFOX1 and DOCK8 have been implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and autism disor ders (ASD). However, the clinical significance of these CNVs is controversial. We analysed 14 RBFOX1 deletions (20 309 kb), six RBFOX1 duplications (34 kb to 1.34 Mb), and eight DOCK8 deletions (22 227 kb) from unrelated individuals. Our analysis revealed that five DOCK8 deletions were terminal and three were interstitial. Two deletions lie within intron 1, two include only exon 1, and four include multiple exons. Thirteen of the RBFOX1 de letions lie within a single intron; deletion of intron 3 and intron 4 are the most common. Though the clinical information provided is limited, seven individuals with RBFOX1 deletions have a diagnosis of ASD. The clinical si gnificance of duplications is difficult to interpret since intragenic gains can lead to loss of function, whereas whole gene duplication can lead to triplo sensitivity. Half of the RBFOX1 duplications have one breakpoint upstream of the gene and one breakpoint in intron 2, which is predicted to maintain the reading frame if the duplications are in direct tandem orientation. One RBFOX1 duplication lies entirely within intron 3 and two include only exon 4, which could lead to an out of frame transcript. Our analysis sheds light on the genomic structures of small CNVs implicated in neurodevelopmental disorder. Only two CNVs had identical breakpoints, suggesting diversity in RBFOX1 and DOCK8 rearrangements rather than a few common variants. However, the clinical significance of these CNV remains unclear since all CNVs we included were inherited. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region. Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population. Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func tional GTF2IRD2 genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls. We also identified a disruptive mutation (p.

2680,743, The power of New Generation Sequencing in identifying mutations in non specific ASD ID phenotypes: the example of SHANK3,P09.019,,"Introduction: autism (ASDs) are characterized by im pairments in reciprocal social communication and stereotyped behaviors. Intellectual Disability (ID) frequently coexists with these two core sym ptoms. Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3 concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo derate to profound ID. SHANK3 haploinsufficiency is frequently associated with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing of this gene.

2680,743, The power of New Generation Sequencing in identifying mutations in non specific ASD ID phenotypes: the example of SHANK3,P09.019,,"Introduction: autism (ASDs) are characterized by im pairments in reciprocal social communication and stereotyped behaviors. Intellectual Disability (ID) frequently coexists with these two core sym ptoms. Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3 concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo derate to profound ID. SHANK3 haploinsufficiency is frequently associated with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing of this gene.

Methods: We studied seventy clinical characteristics in 1115 children that are diagnosed with ASD and have CNV data from the Simons Simplex Coll ection (SSC). Associations between these characteristics and total burden of CNVs as well as specific CNVs, were determined at P<0.01.Results: Rare CNVs were more prevalent among African American females. Interestingly, core ASD traits (i.e. communication and social difficulties) were associated with genomic burden of duplications whereas severity of clinical comorbidities (e.g. IQ, irritability, and pregnancy optimality scores) were associated with genomic burden of deletions. Further, we found asso ciations between several clinical characteristics and specific ASD suscepti bility CNV loci.

In order to analyse me chanism of stress resilience in autism we are using a Tsc2KO mouse model for tuberous sclerosis. TSC2 (together with TSC1) is part of a complex that inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. Mutations in either of the two genes result in increased mTOR activity and upregulated downstream signalling. mTOR signalling plays an important role in memory formation. It also is supposed to be a key player in stress resilience. According to these studies we have established a behaviour battery to ana lyse the consequences of chronic social defeat in Tsc2KO animals. After a 14 daysÃ¢ÂÂ period of chronic stress exposure mice are being analysed in this battery, which consists of an object recognition test, an elevated plus maze test, a test of nest building, an evaluation of social interaction, sucrose pre ference, spontaneous alternation in a Y maze test, a tail suspension test and the analysis of prepulse inhibition of startle response. First results show that non stressed Tsc2KO animals have alterations in social behaviour and in nest building when compared to wildtype mice.

CNVs data were retrieved from a genome wide analysis of CNVs in these children. Results: Savant skills were significantly more prevalent in our sample than in other children with ASD in the SSC cohort (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Child ren with savant skills had, on average, a higher IQ (93.0ÃÂ±24.2 vs. 79.1ÃÂ±25.5; P<0.001), and a larger head circumference (HC) (54.3ÃÂ±2.55 vs. 53.8ÃÂ±2.60; P , 0.003). Interestingly, savant skills were associated with a lower count of rare CNVs among children with ASD (14.0ÃÂ±5.54 vs. 14.8ÃÂ±6.2 for children with and without savant skills respectively; P , 0.03).

The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication can be associated with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. The aim was to assess the neural networks involved in visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval in ASD due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication. Materials and methods: A woman with autistic features, macrocephaly and body asymmetry due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication and 7 healthy controls were investigated. Six runs of BOLD fMRI data were collected to assess the networks of the visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval; a single run of encoding task was followed by 10 minute retention period, then 2 runs of the retrieval tasks both for visual and verbal domain respectively. During encoding participants were instructed to memorize the task stimu li, whilst during retrieval they were instructed to decide whether the given image or word was presented during the encoding period. Data analysis was performed using the SPM8 toolbox under Matlab, with standard processing steps. Results: In patient fMRI for visual memory encoding/retrieval showed hig her activation in the posterior insulae, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared to the controls where visual areas were predominant in these tasks. Verbal memory activation was higher in the hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, precuneus; and lower in the anterior insulae; higher visual areas in our patient compared to the controls. Conclusion: The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication resulted in peculiar activity pat tern of the brain responsible for visual and verbal memory in ASD.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the association of AVPR1A with autism and the functional significance of the markers. Methods: 1) The probands with ASD and their biological parents were re cruited. Diagnosis was ascertained using ADI R and ADOS. 2) Two micro satellites (RS3, RS1) in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ² flanking region and 2 SNPs in the promoter region of AVPR1A were genotyped. Transmission disequilibrium test and quantitative association test with behavior measures were performed using the FBAT package (v.2.0.2c). 4) For evaluation of the functional significance of the associated marker, luciferase assay was performed. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

2696,769, Structural chromosome 21 specific instability in the diseased brain,P09.046,," Introduction. Chromosome 21 aneuploidy has been shown to affect the di seased brain especially in individuals with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD). Howe ver, structural chromosome 21 specific instability has never been a target for molecular (neuro)cytogenetic studies of the diseased brain. Here, we have addressed chromosome 21 structural variations in single cells of the AD, schizophrenia and autism brain as well as in the unaffected brain. Materials and Methods. Ten AD, 18 schizophrenia, 12 autism and 20 age and sex matched samples of the postmortem brain (frontal cortex, Brod mann area 10) were studied by interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding (ICS MCB) and NeuN immunohistochemistry. Results. We were able to show that rare recurrent rearrangements of chro mosome 21 or structural chromosome 21 specific instabilities are found al most exclusively in the AD brain. These were isochromosomes 21q, 21q22 >qter losses and chromosome 21 breaks at 21q21 and 21q22 affecting 0.6 3.7% of cells. NeuN immunohistochemistry has indicated that the instability randomly affects NeuN positive and NeuN negative cell nuclei in contrast to chromosome 21 breaks, which were more prevalent in NeuN positive cell nuclei. Conclusions. Our data suggests that chromosome 21 specific instability is able to contribute to the AD pathogenesis. One can hypothesize chromoso me 21 breaks confined to NeuN positive cells of the AD brain to result from the dysregulation of DNA replication/reparation or DNA damage response pathways.

Material and Methods: Fifty nine premutation carriers (40 females; 19 ma les) (7 females and 9 males with FXTAS) were compared to 50 controls (32 females; 18 males).Results: Our results show that FMR1 premutation carriers have higher so cial anxiety scores and autistic traits compared to controls. Indeed, the SPIN scores were higher increased in women FMR1 premutation carriers compa red to men whereas the AQ scores were similar between the two genders. Finally, SPIN scores were correlated with the repeat size when the CGG num ber was greater than 100.Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that social anxiety is greater in FMR1 premutation carrier women than in controls but not in men.

It has been reported about 120 cases all over the world, wi thout a known incidence. The aim of the study is to characterize a Spanish cohort with MECP2 dupli cation syndrome to improve our knowledge of the disease and perform a genotype phenotype correlation. Material and Method: The cohort consists in 13 patients of both sexes dia gnosed in different Spanish hospitals. The duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array. The clinical characterization was carried out using a checklist designed for the project. The molecular characterization is di vided into several steps: 1) Checking the duplication by qPCR doses, stu dy XCI and FISH; 2) If FISH shows tandem duplication, we narrowed the breakpoints through qPCR, PCR long and Sanger sequencing; 3) Analyze the expression of the two MeCP2 isoforms by RT qPCR. Results: In this collaborative study has been characterized a heterogeneous cohort, with both sexes, with different phenotypes (Rett like and duplicati on patients) and inherited or de novo duplication located in different regi ons (tandem, other region of ChrX or ChrY). However, this information is not enough to create a clear genotype phenotype correlation.

2722,925, First familial case of Angelman syndrome in Bulgaria,P11.012,,"Introduction: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by genetic defects leading to loss of expression of the maternal copy of the chromosome 15q11 13 imprinted region. Most cases are sporadic, being caused by de novo deletion of maternal chromosome 15q11 13 or by paternal uniparental disomy. Familial cases can occur, due to mutations in the UBE3A gene or in the imprinting center. Materials and Methods: We describe two sibs with mental retardation, ab sence of speech, and typical facial dysmorphism. The family members were screened by MS MLPA probemix ME028 B2 Prader Willi/Angelman for copy number variations and assessment of methylation profile. Both child ren MS MLPA profiles were compared with their parents and 3 normal con trols. Results: The test for methylation revealed missing SNRPN methylation spe cific fragments in the patients profile in comparison to their parents and normal controls, which is compatible with paternal non methylated frag ments and deleted or wrong methylated maternal fragments. The copy number test did not show deletion of the SNRPN specific fragments, but two other fragments, corresponding to ASD SRO region (part of the PWS ASD im printing center) were deleted. The deletion was detected in both affected children and it was inherited from the asymptomatic mother. Conclusion: The missing SNRPN methylation specific fragments correspond to wrong methylation (demethylation) on the maternal allele due to deleti on of the PWS ASD imprinting center. This mistake in the methylation profile in both affected children affects maternal copy, while in the asymptomatic mother most probably the deletion affects the paternal copy, hence non pathogenic.",2016.0,,"B.

Methods: We sequenced the exome or screened the exons of SYNGAP1 in a total of 251 patients with neurodevelopmental disorder. Molecular and clinical data from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations from other centers were also collected, focusing on developmental aspects and the associated epilepsy phenotype. A review of SYNGAP1 mutations published in the lite rature was also performed. Results: We describe 17 unrelated affected individuals carrying 13 diffe rent novel loss of function SYNGAP1 mutations. Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1 related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviors in eight patients. Hypotonia and unstable gait were frequent as sociated neurological features.

Triggers of seizures were frequent (n,7). Seizures were pharmacoresistant in half of the patients. The severity of the epilepsy did not correlate with the presence of autistic features or with the severity of cognitive impairment. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, but spared spliced 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons. Seizures in patients with mutations in exons 4 5 were more pharmacoresponsive than in patients with mutations in exons 8 15.Conclusion: SYNGAP1 encephalopathy is characterized by early neurodeve lopmental delay typically preceding the onset of a relatively recognizable epilepsy comprising generalized seizures (absences, myoclonic jerks) and frequent triggers.",2016.0,,"C.

2764,1256, MALAT1: a long non coding RNA involved in alternative splicing regulation and potentially implicated in multiple sclerosis,P13.08,,"Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease, characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of pathogenic links between MS and abnormalities in alternative splicing (AS). Among splicing regulators, besides hnRNPs and SR proteins, long noncoding RNAs (lncR NAs) are emerging as critical players in pre mRNA AS. Here, we aimed at exploring the role of MALAT1, an abundant lncRNA reported to influence ASD through its interaction with pre mRNA splicing factors. Materials and Methods: The expression levels of several splicing regulators, as well as the ASD pattern of specific MS related genes, were evaluated in HEK293, HeLa, and SH SY5Y cells after MALAT1 overexpression or downre gulation. Gene expression analysis was performed by real time RT PCR and RNAseq analysis. Results: Upon MALAT1 modulation, expression levels of splicing regulato ry genes, such as HNRNPF and CELF1, were significantly dysregulated in a cell specific manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MALAT1 overex pression/silencing influence also the ASD pattern of IL7R and PRKCA genes, previously associated with MS susceptibility and characterized by the pres ence of a SNP acting on splicing. Intriguingly, we also detected a significant upregulation (1.4 fold) of MALAT1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients respect to controls (P<0.05).Conclusion: In this work, we provide evidence of a functional link between the lncRNA MALAT1, ASD regulation and MS associated ASD events, suggesting a potential role of MALAT1 in MS pathogenesis.",2016.0,,"E.

2767,1260, A comprehensive genome analysis of three constitutional chromothripsis rearrangements: a new mechanism for complex karyotype disorders,P13.12,,"Chromothripsis is a novel phenomenon in the structural variation lands cape of cancer genomes. We analyzed the genomes of three patients with congenital disease without apparent karyotype anomalies. The rearran gements displayed unanticipated complexity resembling chromothripsis. The array CGH analysis identified complex chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 (Case 1), 12 (Case 2) and 1 and 4 (Case 3). Case 1 presented a complex clinical phenotype in which coexisted 3 known dis orders: Potocki Lupski syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease and neu rofibromatosis type 1. Case 2 showed intellectual disabilities with autistic traits and a particular stromal corneal dystrophy, at the moment described only in adult subjects. Case 3 exhibited a complex clinical picture, not im mediately framed with 1p36 deletion syndrome (array CGH revealed a 3 Mb deletion in 1p36). With whole genome sequencing we investigated the genetic architecture of these constitutional complex chromosomal rearran gements (CCRs),copy number profiling, and breakpoint junctions proving that the rearrangements (deletions/duplications/inversions) identified in our cases were not clustered on a single chromosome region, but on the whole length of the chromosomes.

Results: We defined genome wide scores summarizing the proximity of each gene to the gene lists associated to ASDs.

Materials and Methods: Lists of genes associated with ASDs were collected from a manually curated database and genomic studies. A diffusion based method was used to identify genes in network proximity to those from the lists. Direct and indirect protein protein interactions were collected from five different databases. The Italian cohort (195 cases and 87 controls) was genotyped with a high density platform. Results: We defined genome wide scores summarizing the proximity of each gene to the gene lists associated to ASDs. We highlighted the network regions, with corresponding biological functions, differently represented in the considered genomic studies. We found significant number of genes in network proximity to genes associated with ASDs among the genes reported in the literature as having a minimal evidence of association with ASDs and the genes containing alleles associated with ASDs in our Italian cohort. Conclusions: We summarise the network regions densely populated by ASDs associated genes providing a network based tool to quantify the func tional relation of novel genes with those already associated with ASDs.

During pregnancy, a ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD) and an omphalocele were diagnosed. At the time of presen tation, he demonstrated global developmental delay and unspecific facial dysmorphism. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed an apparently normal male karyotype (46,XY; GTG banding at 550 band level). Array CGH analysis (Agilent 400k microarray set) uncovered a de novo deletion of 1.6 Mb in the chromosomal region 5q35.1 q35.2. This deletion was confirmed by FISH analysis. The deletion comprises 11 genes including the NKX2 5 gene (OMIM 600584). Mutations in the NKX2 5 gene were identified in patients with ASD, VSD, tetralogy of Fallot, and other congenital cardiac defects. The de letion does not overlap with the minimal Sotos syndrome deletion region. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two reports on patients with small deletions in 5q35.1 q35.2 including the NKX2 5 gene. One patient was described with severe heart defect, microcephaly, minor facial dys morphic features, scoliosis, cryptorchidism, learning difficulties associated with ADHD and an IQ of 83. He carried a 2.2 Mb deletion in 5q35.1 q35.2 (Baekvad Hansen et al., 2006).

Materials and method: We have investigated a 34 year old woman with severe intellectual disability, abnormal brain MRI findings suggestive for fronto temporal dementia and primary immunodeficiency characterized through persistent mucosal infections with Candida albicans. Results of EEG, karyotype, cerebral fluid analyses, abdominal ultrasound and urine/plasma metabolic screens were normal. DNA isolated and purified from peripheral venous blood was further as sessed by array CGH platform (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA) using an Array CHX 3x720k slide. Copy number data was analyzed with Nexus 6.1 software (Nexus BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA).Results: Assessment through Array CGH identified 1.65 Mb duplication at 3q29. The duplicated region encompasses 29 genes including several prote in coding genes such as RNF168, WDR53, TFRC, PIGX, PAK2, NCBP2, PIGZ, MFI2, BDH1, FBXO45 or DLG1 and a non coding mRNA: mir4797 Conclusions: We described a case with typical 3q29 microduplication syn drome with severe phenotype. To our knowledge, thus is the first case with primary immunodeficiency features and expands the heterogeneous clini cal spectrum of this syndrome.

In a recent stu dy, a K Cl cotransporter protein, KCC2 gene SLC12A5 on chromosome 20, which previously was linked to idiopathic generalized epilepsy, familial fe brile seizures and schizophrenia, was reported to be associated with func tionally impairing variants in autism. Here, we report a novel association of a polymorhism, rs9074, located in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR region of SLC12A5 with autistic like traits in a healthy population. A total of 75 healthy volunteers aged between 18 30 participated to the study. autistic like traits were quantitized on the autism quotient (AQ) scale. AQ scores measured for each individual were comprised of five subscales of social skills, attention switching, communication, attention to details and imagination categories utilizing a previously validated version of the AQ in Turkish. SNP genotyping assays were performed with specific primers and probes in an RT PCR platform.rs9074 genotypes were distributed as GG:48%, GA:41.3%, AA:10.7% with allele frequencies in HWE. Total AQ (p,0.008), social skills (p,0.002) and at tention switching (p,0.038) subscale scores were significantly higher in AA bearers compared to GG+GA genotypes (Mann Whitney U test). AQ scores were normally distributed. A significant association between AA genotype and social skills scores (p,0.014) in subjects +0.5 SD above average for total AQ (normally distributed) were also noted (FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test).These results suggest a possible role of KCC2 in neurodevelopmental stages in liaison with autism.

Our study aims to bridge this gap through an evo devo approach that focuses on how language evolved in the species and that construes both con ditions as poles of a continuum of modes of cognition, also encompassing typically developing cognition. To this aim, we have performed literature mining and network analysis of known candidate genes for SZ and ASD and found that they are overrepresented among the gene believed to be impor tant for the evolution of the human faculty of language.

Detection of KRASD mutations is critical for effective and appropriate treatment for individual patients. The aim of the present study was to develop Allele Specific PCR (ASD PCR) assay for analysis of the mutational status of KRASD codons 12 and 13, at nucleotides 34, 35 and 38.Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from 41 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer tissues. The ASD primers for specific amplifying wild type KRASD were established. The assay has been validated with pyrosequencing method. The sensitivity and limit of detection were determined. Results: Three ASD primers were successfully distinguished wild type KRASD from the mutant alleles at nucleotides 34, 35 and 38. The limit of detection was detected at 50 55% mutant allele with the lowest amount of DNA at 10 ng/ul.

A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autism and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ï¬uence genetic risk. I. M.

In patients with a speci ï¬c phenotype, the identi ï¬cation of a single gene imbalance, namely a deletion, allows the identi ï¬cation of disease related genes and genotype phenotype correlations. TBL1XR1 mutations have been reported to be associated with autism, autosomal dominant mental retardation(OMIM: 616944) and Pierpont syndrome(OMIM: 602342). Only two cases with genedeletions have been reported: a single case with mild developmental delay(DD) and a 1.6 Mb de novo deletion at 3q26.31q26.32; and a familial case (mother/daughter) withmoderate intellectual disability(ID) and facial dysmorph isms with a 708 kb deletion at 3q26.32. We report a 5Â½ year old male with global DD, growth retardation and dys morphisms with a 3q26.32 de novo deletion, being TBL1XR1 the only known coding gene within the deletion. TBL1XR1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed protein that localizes to the nucleus and plays a role in transcription mediated by nuclear receptors. TBL1XR1 mutations have also been described in autistic patients with ID. In DecipherDatabase, deletions encompassing TBL1XR1 are reported in two patients: one with a de novo deletion and autism, hearing impairment and spotty hyperpigmentation, and theother with a partial de novo deletion of the gene but other genomic imbalances.

2893,224, Maternally inherited deletions in 7q31 encompassing CADPS2 in two unrelated patients with intellectual impairment suggesting a parent of origin effect,P08.14,,"Germany CADPS2 plays an important role in the release of neutrophin 3 and brain derived neutrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is indispensable for brain development. CADPS2 is maternally expressed in human blood and amygdala. Maternally inherited genetic variants of CADPS2 were suggested to contribute to intellectual disability (ID) and autism, whereas paternallyinherited missense variants were not shown to have speci ï¬c phenotype. We report on two unrelated girls, in whom array CGH was performed due to ID and behavioral pro blems. Patient 1, a 13 year old girl showed a microdeletion of 79 kb in 7q31.32(12212618_122291639) (GRCh37/ hg19) encompassing four exons of CADPS2 . Her beha vioral phenotype was characterized by anxiety. She showed mild dysmorphic features in terms of arched eyebrows and a prominent columella, the body measurements were normal. Patient 2, a 4 year old girl, had a microdeletion of 4.15 Mb in 7q31.31q31.32(118243718_122394183) (GRCh37/hg19) encompassing the whole CADPS2 gene. This patient showed behavioral problems consisting of impulsive dis turbance with a tendency of self destruction. She had no distinctive dysmorphic features but shows a secondarymicrocephaly ( â4,5 SD). Both deletions were of maternal origin. Until now only three patients with ID and ASD oftwo families were reported to have deletions of CADPS2 , onede novo and one maternally inherited.

2899,237, A novel KDM6B gene de novo mutation in two siblings with a variable neurocognitive phenotype,P08.29,,"Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Praha 5 Motol, Czech Republic Introduction: The clinical and genetic heterogeneity of neurocognitive disorder (NCD) poses a signi ï¬cant diagnostic challenge. Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ï¬rst line diag nostic and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22 and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con ï¬rmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ï¬ed a thirdâmutation âinKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ï¬ndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

2908,258, Usefulness of oligonucleotide array CGH in clinicaldiagnostics of autism spectrum disorders,P09.11,,"KazÂ´mierczak1, E. Bocian1, P. Stankiewicz2,3,B . Nowakowska1 1Department of Medical Genetics, Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland,22) Department of Molecular & Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States,3Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland autism (ASDs) are one of the most common groups of neurodevelopmental disorder with theprevalence of 1 â2%. Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of ASDs; it has been estimated that sub microscopic copy number variants (CNVs) are the cause ofASDs in ~ 5 â13% of patients. We elected to use aCGH to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 178 patients with ASDs and toidentify novel ASDs genes. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using genome wide oligonucleo tide microarrays (180k; Agilent Technology, OGT) with anaverage resolution of 30 kpz. We identi ï¬ed 25 CNVs in 21 out of 178 (11.8%) patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 12 (6.7%) patients, whereas CNVsof unknown clinical signi ï¬cance were found in 6.2% of patients with ASDs. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were sub microscopic in size (between 75 kb and 4.54 Mb) and thuscould not have been detected by standard karyotype ana lysis.

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors. Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

Incomplete penetrance of theaffected genes and variable expressivity usually is indicated as cause of clinical features. Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities. Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ï¬rmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet.

The deletion occurs near the end of the chromosome at a location designated q13.3.In addition to normal growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological de ï¬cits which include global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual impairment, absent or severely delayed speech, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Some people with this condition have autismor autistic like behavior that affects communication and social interaction, such as poor eye contact, sensitivity to touch, and aggressive behaviors. They may also chew onnon food items such as clothing. Less frequently, people with this condition have seizures. Patient 1: 9 year old girl patient Genetic disease Diagnosis referred to our center with autism like behaviors. The chromosome structure was determined as 46,XX.

It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC related phenotype and its developmental tra jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype ï¬rst approach.

CMA interpretation depends on databases as ClinGen, DECIPHER and others, which lack information, and original papers are still essential in deciphering thesigniï¬cance of microdeletions/microduplications. We pre sent an 8.5 years old boy, with intractable epilepsy, autism, hypotonia during infancy, stra bismus and behavioral problems. Multiple EEG examina tions revealed frequent generalized interictal and ictal slow spike & wave discharges. He has various seizure types, andis treated with a combination of valproic acid, clobazam and ethusuximide with a relative improvement but partial con trol. The child exhibited behavioral problems includingaggression and violence, with recurrent rage attacks. Levetiractam administration escalated the frequency of these behaviors signi ï¬cantly, and therefore was dis continued. Metabolic workup was normal including: lactic, ammonia, blood amino acids, Carnitine, Acylcarnitine. A chromosomal microarray performed demonstrated a dele tion on chromosome 6: arr[hg19]6q22.1(117,431,000 118,040,939)x1. This 609kb deletion including the NUS1 gene is located within the minimal essential critical regionon chromosome 6q22. The region is known for autism, seizures, tremor and mild dysmorphic features, but less known for behavioural problems as in the case presented. The databases mentioned had only scarce information on the microdeletion, and we found only one paper interpreting it. This work further delineates this rare genetic disorder. We suggest that behavioral problems are part of this microdeletion, and suggest caution using Levetiractam in these patients.

The etiology of ASD is complex including genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. 2q13 dupli cation have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, ASD and dysmorphism. Several previous studies have linked the NPHP1 gene, located inthis genomic region, to ASD. In this paper we report a new case of 2q13 duplication in association with ASD and intellectual disability. The patient is a 5 years old boy bornat term from health, non consanguineous parents who was referred to the department of Child Psychiatry for speech delay and behavioral problems. Clinical evaluation revealeddysmorphic features (high forehead, large protruding ears, open held mouth), severe speech delay (he says only 6 simple words), moderate intellectual disability, autisticbehavior (no visual contact, dif ï¬cult social interaction, stereotypic movements).

Here we report autistic behaviour patient with lack of speech and developmental delay that was referred for genetic testing. Both father andbrother of the proban are heterozygous carriers of beta talasemia mutations. The patient was previously tested for Fragile X syndrome and X linked mental retardation relatedgenes were sequenced as well as whole exome sequencing was performed without detecting any relevant variants correlating with the clinical features. The only positiveresult was for HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genes predisposing to celiac disease. At the end aCGH array (180K) was per formed and it detected 278kb duplicated region (11p14.3 /chr11: 22102205 22361578) that included the ANO5 and SLC17A6 genes. This duplication was interpreted as uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance based on the international recommendations. Second aCGH analysis with higher resolution (2,7M) was perform so we can gain additional information and eventually to clarify the previous ï¬nding. An additional duplication of 312 kb was detected in chro mosome 15 (15q11.2), which included 4 genes: TUBGCP5 , CYFIP1 ,NIPA2 and NIPA1 (PMIDs: 28588435, 27566550).

The worldwide prevalence of autism is increasing. However, autism prevalence is low (0.27%) in Brazil due to misdiagnosis of the disorder. Material and Methods: We report on 16 probands with ASD referred by the public health system of GoiÃ¡s. ASD assessment using autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI R), G band karyotyping, and PCR of FMR1 using Amplidex Â®kit were carried out for all patients. Chromoso mal Microarray Analysis (CMA) using GeneChipÂ®CytoScanHDTMarray was done for patients who had normal results in karyotype and PCR. Results: The behavioral phenotypes for all participants were classi ï¬ed in the ASD according to ADI R results whose karyotypes showed neither visible numerical nor structural chromosomal aberrations. FMR1 analysis revealed two children affected by Fragile X syndrome. CMA showed a total of 21 CNVs identi ï¬ed in 12/14 (86%) patients. A total of 13/21 pathogenic CNVs were observedin 8 patients, all located at genetic ASD hotspots, including 22q11.23, Xp22.33 (2/13), 16p11.2 (3/13), harboring no OMIM genes. However, the hotspots at 15q13.3, 15q11.2(2/13), and Xp11.23 (2/13) harbored CHRNA7 ,PWRN2 and ZNF630 genes, respectively, associated with ASD.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

Here, we systematically dissected the functional networks associatedwith 16p11.2 RGD from transcriptome analyses of 70 mice with reciprocal CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region across cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, as well as liver, white andbrown adipose tissues in a subset of 16 mice (n ,250 samples). We integrated these data with brain tissues from a Kctd13 mouse model (a putative driver of 16p11.2 neu roanatomical phenotypes, n ,50), and CRISPR engi neered, isogenic 16p11.2 iPSC derived NSCs (n ,25) and induced neurons (n ,27). The strongest magnitude of effect sizes from 7qF3 were observed across brain regions by comparison to non brain tissues (cortex 7qF3 region aver age p value ,8.80E 35; non brain p ,0.0013), re ï¬ecting the ~3x higher basal expression changes. Coexpression network analyses isolated a consistent module of 16p11.2 genes, as well as a module that was highly enriched forconstrained genes (ExAC pLI â¥0.9), autism associated genes, early fetal development coexpression networks derived from BrainSpan, and neurological phenotypes andprocesses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in this âconstrained âmodule network; moreover, DEGs from the Kctd13 mouse coalesced into this samemodule (cortex enrichment p ,7.82E 41), suggesting overlap in altered transcriptional networks between full length CNV and deletion of KCTD13 alone. These analysesidentify a tissue speci ï¬c impact of 16p11.2 RGD that converges on a module of co expressed genes that are intolerant to genetic perturbation and associated with criticalprocesses in human neurodevelopment.

3080,77,D The role of next generation sequencing in the differential diagnosis of congenital iris anomalies,P02.02,,"Genetics Department, IIS FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az CIBERER, UAM, Madrid, Spain Abnormal development of the iris is a feature of severalcongenital ocular malformations. Classical aniridia, the most common form, is a panocular disease characterized by iris and foveal hypoplasia, keratopathy, cataracts andglaucoma, caused by PAX6 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. The pre sence of variable expressivity and phenotypic overlapping with other types of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD)hinders the genetic characterization of atypical presentations of aniridia. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of NGS to improve the clinical diagnosis of these pathologies. Acohort of 106 families was studied, including cases with classical aniridia or atypical forms (iris hypoplasia, atrophy or coloboma). The entire PAX6 gene and other 260 genes associated with ocular malformations were analyzed using custom targeted NGS and aCGH approaches, as well as clinical or whole exome and/or Sanger sequencing. About82% of the cases presented likely pathogenic variants or CNVs in 5 different genes. Defects in PAX6 explain 75% of cases, including not only all characterized cases withclassical aniridia, but also 30% of patients with more atypical presentations, in whom LOF or atypical missense and non coding variants were identi ï¬ed, respectively. Other aniridia like patients presented pathogenic variants in ASD related genes or variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance in candidate genes. Molecular analysis of iris malformationspresents high diagnostic yield not only in cases with classical aniridia (95%) but also in patients with aniridia like phenotypes (>50%). Our work evidences the clinicalutility of differential genetic studies based on NGS in patients with congenital iris anomalies.

While most (80%) ASD cases are X linked, approximately 15% and 5% areautosomal recessive or dif ï¬cult to differentiate from thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) dominant forms. Digenic inheritance among COL4A3 COL4A5 or their concomitance with other glomerulopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD) related genes, has been recently proposed to explain the variable phenotypic expression andincomplete penetrance frequently observed in ASD patients.1244Materials and Methods: NGS analysis of 55 glomer ulopathy and CKD related genes was performed in a group of 56 unrelated Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In all patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. Overall, 17 known and 32 novel, likely pathogenic alterations in COL4A3 COL4A5 were identi ï¬ed. The inheritance was X linked in 73% of cases, remaining 9% autosomal recessive and 18% were dominant AS/TBMN. Changes were randomly distributed across allCOL4A3 COL4A5 coding regions, however we revealed a recurrent COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A in twelve patients. Additionally, four patients with this alteration had likelypathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 , which may modify disease âs severity. Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the gen otypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on the genotype phenotype correlations. Multiple gene sequencing is an effective approach to obtain geneticinformation in AS, particularly about the mode of inheri tance which is important for counselling and may help to predict the clinical course, especially for those patients withmild, non speci ï¬c or atypical phenotype.

Changes were randomly distributed across allCOL4A3 COL4A5 coding regions, however we revealed a recurrent COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A in twelve patients. Additionally, four patients with this alteration had likelypathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 , which may modify disease âs severity. Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the gen otypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on the genotype phenotype correlations. Multiple gene sequencing is an effective approach to obtain geneticinformation in AS, particularly about the mode of inheri tance which is important for counselling and may help to predict the clinical course, especially for those patients withmild, non speci ï¬c or atypical phenotype.

FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectual disability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano metry.

The majority of reported patients harbored de novo loss of function (LoF) variants. To date, the phenotype of only four patients has been precisely described in the literature, contrasting with the relative frequency of detection of such LoF GATAD2B variants. Here, we describe 10 patients with con ï¬rmed LoF GATAD2B variants and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Methods: Patients were included by contacting referent clinicians from several French genetics departments. Results: Developmental delay was severe with a median age of 2.4 years (range [2 5]) for independent walking and of 2.75 years (range [1 4]) for ï¬rst spoken words. They showed very little subsequent progress, one patientremaining non verbal at age 30 years. ID was mostly moderate, with only one severe and one mild case, which differs from the original description of severe ID. Mostcommon dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, downturned mouth and, anomalies of the extremities. Conversely, prenatal compli cations, non cerebral organ malformations, epilepsy and autistic behaviour were very rare. One patient presented asthma and recurrent respiratory infections, another onepresented severe feeding dif ï¬culties and developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and IgG de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: NGS based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of GATAD2B variations. Better knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for a cor rect interpretation of the molecular results and for anaccurate management of these patients. G. Vera: None. A. Sorlin: None. G.

Patients with BRPS show delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, speech alterations, hypotonia, poor growth and dysmorphic features. It is categorized as a syndromic cause of autism. Nowadays, 33 patients with BRPS have been reported. Our work expands the mutational spectrum of the ASXL3 with the genotype phenotype characterizing 11 new patients. Material and Methods: In a collaborative initiative we have identi ï¬ed 11 patients with neurodevelopmental dis orders and ASD phenotype with loss of function(LoF) mutations in the ASXL3 gene. Exome sequencing was used as a diagnostic tool and Sanger sequencing was used forfamilial segregation. The mutational spectrum of ASXL3 was revised in public_data (PubMed, Clinvar, SFARI). Results: We identi ï¬ed 10 new ASXL3 LoF variants and one recurrent mutation (c.3106C>T;p. Arg1036Ter). The main clinical characteristics of our patients included moderate severe intellectual disability with ASD traits andneuroconductual disorder including aggressively behavior in adolescence. Dysmorphic features highly suggestive of ASXL3 were delineated eyebrows and the skeletal pheno type. So far, 77 different LoF mutations (48 frameshifts, 28 Stop Gain, 1 splicing) have been identi ï¬ed including our present results. There are 3 recurrent mutations and 73unique variants. Conclusions: The inclusion of new patients with BRPS increases the knowledge of mutational spectrum of ASXL3 and is essential to further delineate the phenotype of this syndrome.

Whole exome sequencing (WES), surprisingly, disclosed a de novo missense mutation in PHF6 , in the same functional domain as our ï¬rst patient; in this case, X inactivation analysis showed normal X inactivation in blood lymphocytes. BFLSis an X linked recessive disease, characterized by ID, epilepsy, hypogonadism, hypometabolism, obesity and a typical facial gestalt; female carriers usually not show anyï¬ndings or present only mild symptoms. To date, de novo aberrations in PHF6 were reported in 13 females with a variable phenotype, characterized by ID, characteristicfacial features, ï¬ngers and dental anomalies, only partially overlapping with BFSL as described in males. Molecular genetics has opened a new path to understand thecomplexity of ID, mostly in female patients, where we would tend to exclude a priori a known as X linked recessive condition. However, in cases with heterogeneousID phenotypes, WES is the instrument to address the exact diagnosis, as suggested in our second case. A. Pagliazzi: None. R. Artuso: None. G. Tra ï¬cante: None.

We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%). CYP2D6 metabo lizes most psychoactive drugs, while CYP1A1 acts on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of endocrine disrupting chemi cals (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A). Early exposure to neurotoxic phthalates, bisphenol A and PAHs has been previously associated with ASD risk, and here we provideevidence for an effect of gene environmental exposure interaction mediated by CYP450 gene variants.

Additionally, 5 NMD genes were found to betargeted by CNVs in 12 ASD subjects but none of the controls.

It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD. We elected to use oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 275 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k).

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028).

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations.

Vincent1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada,2Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,3Queen âs University,, Kingston, ON, Canada, 4University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Worcester, MA, United States Introduction: Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein, playing a critical role in multiple processes, including ribosome assembly and maturation, chromatin decondensa tion, and pre rRNA transcription. Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p. Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen cing of an autism trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p.

Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Madrid, SpainIntroduction: The Spanish Undiagnosed Rare disease Program (SpainUDP) performs extended genetic analyses and deep phenotyping to get a de ï¬nite diagnosis in rare syndrome cases. We present the case of a 3 year old male with severe generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness together with neurodevelopmental delay. He presentsmicrocephaly and dysmorphic features highlighting micro retrognathy, low set ears and hypertelorism. Materials and Methods: Trio based exome analysis was carried out by using Nextera Truseq Rapid Enrichment kit and sequenced in NextSeq500 (Illumina). Results: The exome analysis revealed a novel mutation consisting on a small de novo 30 bp deletion in exon 9 of AUTS2 gene (autism susceptibility candidate 2, OMIM:607270), which allowed the diagnosis of this patientas AUTS2 syndrome or Mental Retardation, autosomal dominant 26 (OMIM:615834). AUTS2 gene is involved in the development of neurological disorder. Alterations ofAUTS2 gene were described as a result of genomic rear rangements, although large copy number variations and intragenic deletions or mutations have also been describedto cause this syndrome. It is noteworthy that the deletion found in this patient included the transcription start site of the short isoform of the gene, which plays an important rolein brain development. The gene expression analysis showed that the deletion causes reduction in the level of expression not only of the short isoform but also of the completetranscript of the gene. Conclusions: This case helps in establishing the genotype phenotype correlation adding more evidence tothe role of mutations speci ï¬cally affecting the short isoform for the development of a severe phenotype.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers. Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange ment.

Biomedicine, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden,7Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden We recently reported novel recurrent germline and somatic mutations in the myosin Vb motor gene ( MYO5B )i n malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PCC/PGL),an adolescent/adult counterpart to neuroblastoma arising from the same neural crest origin. Here, we have explored the functional impact of three MYO5B missense mutations(p. L587P, p. G1611S, and p. R1641C) with respect to proliferation, migration and intracellular traf ï¬cking in vitro . MYO5B mutated cDNA clones (pCMV6 MYO5B Myc DKK tagged) were generated by site directed mutagenesis and stably transfected into human embryonic1594kidney cells (HEK293) and SK N ASD neuroblastoma cells. All three MYO5B mutants demonstrated a signi ï¬cantly increased proliferation rate compared to MYO5B wild type clones (p<0.001). The Scratch wound assay also indicated an increased migration rate (p<0.05) in cells harboring the two somatic variants p. L587P (located in the motor domain)and p. G1611S (located in the tail dilute domain). Moreover, investigating the endocytic recycling pathway by the transferrin assay showed an increased transferrin uptake inp. L587P and p. G1611S mutants, indicating a disturbed intracellular transport. Immunohistochemistry and transcrip tomic analysis of 31 primary PCC/PGL tumor cases show adifferential expression of MYO5B mRNA and protein levels in some malignant PGLs, as well as a changed subcellular localization of MYO5B in one PGL caseharboring an acquired p. G1611S MYO5B mutation. We are currently exploring downstream effects in mutant clones by expression microarrays to identify the proliferationpathways activated by MYO5B mutations. Our study uncovers the functional role of MYO5B in proliferation and migration in adrenal neural tumors, which mightimprove future therapeutic implication. J. Olausson: None. T. Te Å¡an Tomi Ä:None.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ï¬rst benchmarked our bioinfor matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conï¬rmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ï¬rst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B. B.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c disease, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaselike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

Themain reason is a defective glomerular ï¬ltration barrier allowing the passage of serum proteins, including albumin, into the urine. Largely overlooked, a failure of reabsorbingtheï¬ltered proteins in the proximal tubular segment can also lead to a mild tubular proteinuria, but it is unclear if it is harmful for the kidney. Here, we combine targeted andexome sequencing to explore the contribution of tubular genes to chronic subnephrotic proteinuria (0,5 3 g/24h). Altogether, we identi ï¬ed 24 patients with recessive mutations in the tubular uptake receptor cubilin ( CUBN) . Meta analyzing our in house genetic database, we further identify a signi ï¬cant association between loss of function CUBN mutations and proteinuric conditions. The tubular proteinuria in the CUBN patients was atypical, lacking important tubular proteinuria markers and consisting ofmore than 50% albumin. Importantly, the renal function was normal, even in old patients, suggesting that the proteinuria is benign. All identi ï¬ed mutations localize to the C terminal half of the protein, which is in contrast to the known N terminal Imerslund GrÃ¤sbeck mutations for CUBN featured by Vitamin B12 malabsorption in addition to the proteinuria. Some mutations have an allele frequency of 0.5% suggesting that this kind of proteinuria is not uncommon. This is supported by the gnomAD databaseshowing a high prevalence of damaging CUBN variants, mostly localizing to the C terminal half. In summary, we identify C terminal CUBN mutations as a common but benign cause of chronic proteinuria. M. Bedin: None. O. Boyer: None. A. Servais: None. L. Villoing GaudÃ©: None. O. Gribouval: None.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) liver iron, compared to circulating iron traits,permit detection of liver speci ï¬c susceptibility loci. We performed the ï¬rst GWASD of MRI determined liver iron in 8,289 individuals in UK Biobank and validated ourresults in 1,513 individuals from DIRECT. Liver iron was calculated from MRI data using LiverMultiScanTM. We used GEMMA, which corrects for relatedness and popula tion structure, and adjusted our model for age, sex, BMI and genotyping array. We identi ï¬ed three independent genetic variants (rs1800562 & rs1799945 in HFE, rs855791 in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron (P < 5x10 8). Both HFE and TMPRSS6 are involved in hepcidin production, the keyhormone responsible for iron balance in the body. We estimated the heritability of liver iron to be 7.39%. The most genetically correlated traits in LD score regressionanalysis were transferrin (rG ,â0.78) and ferritin (rG , 1.24) with nominal signi ï¬cant correlation. In our Mendelian randomisation analysis, we found some evidence that highercentral obesity, measured as waist to hip ratio, is casually associated with higher liver iron content (IVW P ,0.003). Phenome wide association analysis demonstrates sharedaetiology of elevated liver iron with high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, extrahepatic malignancies, neuropsychiatric, endocrine and rheumatological conditions, and an inverseassociation with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease. Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying excess liver iron are likely systemic not organ speciï¬c.

Muotri11University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States,2Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, United States Introduction: The 16p11.2 is the most common among all rare copy number variants (CNVs) associated with autismspectrum disorder (ASD). We investigated neurodevelop mental processes impacted by the dosage changes of 16p11.2 CNV using cerebral organoid models. Materials and Methods: We generated 3D cultures (i.e. human cerebral organoids) that model human fetal brain development using iPSCs derived from skin ï¬broblasts of 16p11.2 deletion (DEL) and duplication (DUP) carriers. Transcriptome sequencing, proteomic pro ï¬ling and immu noï¬uorescence were carried out to investigate molecular and cellular impact of the 16p11.2 CNV. Cell migration, neuronal morphology and synaptogenesis were also investigated. Results: Cerebral organoid recapitulated macrocephaly and microcephaly phenotypes observed in 16p11.2 DEL and DUP carriers. Increased proliferation of neuropro genitor cells was observed in DELs. Gene co expression network analyses identi ï¬ed co expression modules that were strongly associated with 16p11.2 copy number status. A module enriched in genes with cell migration and loco motion functions was downregulated in DELs. A module enriched in genes with synaptic functions, was upregulatedin DELs. Severe migration defects in DEL organoids were conï¬rmed by Boyden chamber assay. Neurons derived from DEL organoids had longer neurites and increased soma size. The number of functional synapses was also higher in DEL organoids. Treatment with the RhoA inhibitor rhosin res cued cell migration defects. Conclusion: Cerebral organoids recapitulate patients head size phenotypes and gene expression pro ï¬les of fetal human brain. Genes associated with cell migration andsynaptic functions were dysregulated by the 16p11.2 CNV. These molecular ï¬ndings were validated experimentally and rescued by a small molecule inhibitor. L.

De novo missense variants in this gene have been linked to developmental disorder (DD) in a large scale study ofpatients with severe undiagnosed DD (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Only ï¬ve patients have been reported to date and clinical data remains very scarce. We report a new patientwith COL4A3BP related intellectual disability (ID) aiming to contribute to the recognition of this condition. Materials and methods: Clinical data was collected from the patient âs medical records and compared with previous reports from scienti ï¬c literature and databases. Results: A 5 year old girl with unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery, presented with postnatal microcephaly, axial hypotonia, and severe global864 J. del Picchiadevelopmental delay. Short stature and facial dysmorphisms were noted and, at 24 months, she developed generalized seizures. Currently, she does not walk unaided, says only one word, and has poor visual contact and marked stereotypic behavior with bruxism. Whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a de novo pathogenic variant in COL4A3BP (S260L). Conclusions: This missense variant was previously found in 4 out of 5 known patients, suggesting a mutational hotspot in this gene. Former functional evidence indicates itresults in intracellular imbalances in ceramide, pivotal to the synthesis of sphingolipids. Our case has signi ï¬cant overlap with clinical data from previous patients.

We described two unrelated patients with ASD,ID and facial dysmorphia who carried the duplication of 2q37 including DIS3L2 . We suggest that this CNV might cause of abnormal phenotype with variable penetrance. Ofcourse, we cannot exclude a nucleotide level changes which could explain a variable penetrance of 2q37 duplication. Acknowledgment :Supported by MH_CZ_DRO_F NOL_00098892, IGA_LF_2020_007 Z.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ï¬ndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the ï¬rstPTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe. This is also the largest pediatriccohort for PTEN prevalence study in patients with ASD and macrocephaly. Materials and methods: PTEN sequencing were done for 128 patients with ASD and head cir cumference size more than 97% on growth charts between the ages of 3 to 18 recruited from ï¬ve different child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in Turkey. Result: We found 2known pathogenic, 1 new pathogenic and 2 variants of insigni ï¬cance (VUS) mutations out of 128 patients. The prevalence is 2,3% (VUS mutations are excluded).

3374,255, Neurodevelopmental disorders and chromatin remodel ing dysregulation: the lessons from Kabuki syndromespectrum and clinical presentation of Tunisian cases,P11.056,,"Kaabi, W. Ltaif, S. Aloulou, S. Mallek, S. Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ï¬lled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ï¬nally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ï¬ve cardinal manifestations of KB deï¬ned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ï¬nitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ï¬rmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N. B. Abdelmoula: B.

The most frequent cause of mono genic ID the fragile X syndrome is due to the absence of the RNA binding protein (RBP) FMRP. Many other IDgenes have been implicated in the RNA metabolism. NOVA2 is a RBP known to regulate neuron speci ï¬c alternative splicing (AS). We identi ï¬ed 6 individuals with de novo frameshift variants in NOVA2 affected with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by ID, motor and speech delay, autistic features, spasticity or ataxic gaitand abnormal brain MRI. All variants cluster in a small GC repeat rich region, located in the last exon, indicating that the mutated transcript might escape to nonsense mediated decay. All 6 frameshift variants lead to the addition of a novel common C terminal part instead of the last KH RNA binding domain, suggesting a dominant negative mechan ism. We detected 41 genes differentially spliced after downregulation of NOVA2 in human neuronal cells. TheNOVA2 variant protein shows decreased ability to bind target RNA sequences and to regulate target ASD events. It also fails to complement the effect on neurite outgrowthinduced by NOVA2 downregulation in vitro and to rescue alterations of retinotectal axonal path ï¬nding induced by loss of NOVA2 ortholog in zebra ï¬sh. Our results showed that truncating mutations in NOVA2 cause a syndromic form of ID, suggesting a hypomorphic mechanism rather than a full heterozygous loss of function, although a speci ï¬c con tribution of the novel C terminal extension cannot be excluded.

3420,126, Autism Comorbidities: Role of CHD8 during the Development of the Enteric Nervous System,C12.4,,"IGBMC, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France Introduction: CHD8 is mutated in 0.21% of total autism cases. Recently, clinical reas sessment highlighted the high prevalence of gastrointestinal(GI) defects in ASD. Transient suppression of chd8 in zebra ï¬sh led to a reduced number of enteric neurons and a decreased gut mobility which likely drive the GI problems(Bernier et al. Cell, 2014). Materials and Methods: To understand how the loss of chd8 causes the loss of mature enteric neurons, we generated and characterized a stable mutant zebra ï¬sh line: Tg(chd8 sa19827;phox2bb:GFP ) in which the neuronal pro genitors (i.e. enteric neural crest cells, eNCCs) are labeledwith GFP. Results: First, we observed a migration delay and reduced proliferation of eNCCs during early developmentand a decreased number of mature neurons and more speciï¬cally serotonergic neurons at 5 days post fertilization. Second, transcriptomic analyses of eNCCs revealed theupregulation of the serotonin receptor htr6 and the dysregulation of several actors of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity and RhoA pathways, extracellular matrix compo nents, and several genes from the human morbid genome. Third, behavioral analyses showed i) hyperactivity of the mutant chd8 larvae and ii) normal sociability and no aggressive behavior in the adult mutants. Conclusion: We showed that the decreased number of enteric neurons in absence of chd8 is due to a combination of proliferation, migration and differentiation defects of the eNCCs. Moreover, our transcriptomic data identi ï¬ed druggable targets in chd8 associated signaling pathwaysand we are currently performing rescue experiments with small molecules in the chd8 mutants.

Third, behavioral analyses showed i) hyperactivity of the mutant chd8 larvae and ii) normal sociability and no aggressive behavior in the adult mutants. Conclusion: We showed that the decreased number of enteric neurons in absence of chd8 is due to a combination of proliferation, migration and differentiation defects of the eNCCs. Moreover, our transcriptomic data identi ï¬ed druggable targets in chd8 associated signaling pathwaysand we are currently performing rescue experiments with small molecules in the chd8 mutants.

Pre synaptic disorder, characterized bycongenital nystagmus and photophobia, night blindness, are known as cone rod synaptic disorder (CRSD) can be mis taken for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Full ï¬eld electroretinogram is crucial for the differential diagnosis, but it can be dif ï¬cult to perform in young children. Here, we report (i) the identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in the RIMS2 gene encoding a pre synaptic protein not yet asso ciated with human disease in 3/4 families initially referred for LCA and (ii) the diagnostic adjustment to CRSD withvariable associated alteration including autistic behavior and insulinopathy. Methods : Exome sequencing combined with targeted RIMS2 testing were performed in 46 prescreened patients with CRSD and 94 with LCA. Biallelic RIMS2 mutated cases underwent ophthalmologic, neurologic and metabolicassessment. RIMS2 immunostaining was performed on human retina, brain and pancreas. Nonsense variants were functionally investigated in mammalian cells. Results. Biallelic RIMS2 sequence variants were found in four unrelated families. RIMS2, a protein regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis localizes in the human retinal outerplexiform layer, Purkinje cells and pancreatic islets. Apart from CRSD, neurodevelopmental disease was observed in all cases, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in the eldestpatient.?Nonsense variants lead to truncated RIMS2 and decreased insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Conclusion : This is the ï¬rst report of syndromic CRSD with neurodevelopmental or pancreatic involvement due to RIMS2 loss of function. The disease presentation is con sistent with the localization and function of RIMS2. S. Mechaussier: None. B. Almoallem: None. C. Zeitz: None. K. Van Schil: None. L. Jeddawi: None. J. VanDorpe: None.

Introduction: Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorder that can be isolatedor syndromic. Biallelic ALDH1A3 variants are responsible for 11% of recessive AM cases, mostly described in consanguineous families, and present severe bilateral AM with variable neurodevelopmen tal anomalies. We present six families with biallelic ALDH1A3 variants, further characterising the associated phenotype. Material and Methods: AM individuals from UK, France and Spain were analysed by WES, targeted gene screening and arrays. Results: We identi ï¬ed 6 families: Family 1) with two brothers with bilateral anophthalmia, one present additional developmen tal delay, absent speech and autism with compound heterozygousALDH1A3 variants (c.874G>T:p.(D292Y);c.1393A>T:p.(I465F)); 2) a boy with bilateral anophthalmia, developmental and intellectual delay, seizures and autistic features with compound heterozygous variants (c.845G>C:p.(G282A);c.1459A>G:p.(R487G)); 3) a girl withbilateral microphthalmia and coloboma with compound hetero zygous variants (c.847_849del;p.(G283del);c.953C>A,:p.(S318Y)); 4) a girl with bilateral anophthalmia with a homozygous missense variant (c.1144G>A:p.(G382R)); 5) a boy with bilateral microphthal mia, unilateral coloboma and cataract, with a homozygous splice variant (c.1233 +2T>C) and 6) a boy with bilateral microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, facial dysmorphism with ahomozygous missense variant (c.434C>T:p. A145V). Conclusions: Three of the six families presented with com pound heterozygous variants, highlighting this mode of inheri tance in ALDH1A3 related disorder. Five of 6 families had a variant in the catalytic domain, supporting the importance of this domain,which is critical for substrate selectivity. Severe neurodevelop mental phenotypes were present in two individuals, and variably penetrant in family 1, supporting that this can be an importantfeature of the ALDH1A3 syndrome.",2021.0,,Y.

Introduction: Alport syndrome (AS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous nephropathy caused by pathogenic variants inCOL4A3, COL4A4 orCOL4A5 . About 85% of ASD patients have X linked inheritance, which causes more severe phenotype in males, whereas in females, penetrance depends onX chromosome inactivation pattern. Originating in the MiddleAges COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A p. Gly624Asp is predominant in Central/East Europe and mostly gives mild ASD symptoms. Materials and Methods: Next generation sequencing analysis of glomerulopathy and chronic kidney disease related genes panelwas performed in Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In 65 patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. The most frequent was X linked ASD caused by 32different COL4A5 variants (75%). A recurrent COL4A5 variant p. Gly624Asp in 15 patients (nine males and six females) was identi ï¬ed. Additionally, four patients with this substitution had pathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 . The clinical course of patients with this genotype was mostly milder than observed in individuals with other COL4A5 variants. They presented only haematuria with or without proteinuria. Of these, two patients alsohad hearing impairment: male with only p. Gly624Asp variant andfemale with additional variant in COL4A3 . Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the genotypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on thegenotype phenotype correlations. Variant p. Gly624Asp in COL4A5 was predominant and accounted for 31% of X linked ASD in the study group. Observations of mild phenotype in our patients withthis genotype relate to literature data.

Introduction: Type IV collagen related nephropathy covers a spectrum of hereditary hematuric disease (thin basementmembrane nephropathy, TBMN; Alport syndrome, AS). Whereas ASD results from disease causing variants in COL4A3 5 (autosomal recessive and X linked AS), monoallelic disease causing variants inCOL4A3/4 are associated with TBMN. Methods: Variants of 96 index cases reported between 2009 and 2014 with the clinical tentative diagnosis ASD (77/96), TBMN (13/96) or unclear determination of AS/TBMN (6/96) weremeticulously reinterpreted based on ACMG criteria and current amendments. Monoallelic (likely) pathogenic variants in COL4A3 /4 in an ASD case were not considered as diagnostic, as thedesignation âautosomal dominant ASD âis contested. 6 cases had to be excluded from further analysis due to limited data. Results: In total, 84 variants (allocated to 96 cases) and their genotypes have been reassessed ( COL4A3 : 21/84, COL4A4 : 18/84, COL4A5 : 45/84). 64/90 cases included in the further analysis could be classi ï¬ed as solved (original report: 83/90; p< 0.001, Fisher exact test). 26/90 were classi ï¬ed as ânot solved â(original report: 7/ 90), due to inconclusive results on variant (11/90), on genotype(12/90) or both variant and genotype level (3/90).

The pathop hysiological mechanisms are still unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate if this group of patients is burdened by mutations in genes associated with ASD. Methods: We included 147 patients with an unrepaired ASD. We curated a list of ASD candidate genes, and patients wereanalyzed for genetic variants in these genes, using targeted next generation sequencing. We ï¬ltered for protein altering variants (PAVs) with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01 and predictedpathogenicity using the Combined Annotation Dependent Deple tion (CADD) method. The number of rare and pathogenic variants in cases were compared with variants identi ï¬ed in 33,370 controls of European ancestry. Results: We identi ï¬ed 384 rare (MAF < 0.01) PAVs in 59 genes. ASD patients were signi ï¬cantly enriched for very rare (MAF < 0.0001) PAVs compared to controls (P ,0.0001). The frequency of PAVs with CADD score â¥30 was signi ï¬cantly higher in ASD patients, compared to controls (P ,0.0042). Conclusions: Patients with a small, unrepaired ASD were enriched for rare PAVs within 59 ASD candidate disease genes.

ASD is caused by the loss of expression of the maternal copy of theUBE3A gene in 15q11.2 q13 imprinted region. Many genetic mechanisms are involved, of which the most frequent was the deletion of the maternally inherited 15q11.2 q13 region. Materials and Methods: Clinical and genetic analyses of a cohort of 44 patients, referred to our Department of Congenital and Hereditary disease from 2004 to 2020. MS PCR was performed for diagnostic con ï¬rmation while FISH, microsatellites study and UBE3A gene sequencing were realized to genetic mechanism determination. Results: We noted one familial form with 6/44 affected cases and 38/44 sporadic ones. The sex ratio was 1,44. The averageage at the ï¬rst presentation was 4 years and at the diagnosis conï¬rmation was 4.5 years. All patients had developmental delay, severe speech impairment and characteristic behavior. Seizures and ataxia were noted in 81.8 and 72.7% of patients, respectively. The physical examination revealed hypopigmenta tion (72.7%), an evocative facial dysmorphia. 70.4%, microce phaly (63.6%) and strabismus (68% ). The follow up was possible for only 59% of patients. The ge netic mechanisms were 15q11 q13 microdeletion (30/44), UBE3A mutations (8/44) and maternal DUP15 (3/44).Conclusion: We studied the largest cohort of ASD in Tunisia.

The whole exome sequencing test identi ï¬ed in the CDK13 gene a heterozygous variant p. (Asp855Glu). To our knowledge, this variant is not reported before, and it is absent in the general population in the control databases. In silico analysis, predict adeleterious effect of this variant. Based on the ACMG guidelines,this variant is classi ï¬ed as a likely pathogenic variant. There are no variants identi ï¬ed in other genes in this child; this gene can most likely explain this child âs phenotype.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorder or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorder (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorder without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

Introduction: autism is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families.

Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.

Introduction: autism are complex and lifelong heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions. Different genetic models could explain ASD, ranging from monogenic disorder or copy number variation to polygenic disease. Mito chondrial DNA (mtDNA) may have a role in the pathogenesis ofASD. Materials and Methods: Our cohort consists of 98 families including 117 subjects with ASD, 193 parents and 59 unaffectedsiblings. We performed deep sequencing of mtDNA, de ï¬ning haplogroups and evaluating private variants, including those at low heteroplasmy. An independent cohort of 127 Italian families was used as a replica. Both these cohorts were compared to a controlgroup of 5088 healthy individuals. MtDNA content was assessed inblood cells. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate risk factors inï¬uencing ASD severity classi ï¬ed by the calibrated severity score of autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Results: Haplogroup H in probands resulted protective for ASD, counterbalanced by increased risk conferred by haplogroups L and I. Paternal haplogroups U5a and K increased the risk ofdeveloping ASD in offspring. Probands showed increased numberof missense mutations in MT ATP6 and MT ATP8 and reduced mtDNA content. Paternal super haplogroups H and JT are associated with mild phenotypes, whereas variants with 15% 5%heteroplasmy are associated with severe phenotypes.

Emerging evidence suggest s that various genetic compo nents can account for these cases according to an oligogenic model. After the observation of a patient with deleterious variants inmultiple genes (FrontGenet, https://doi.org/10.3389/ fgene.2021.625564 ), we extended the search for possible oligogenic mechanisms to a cohort of 30 ASD trio families. Methods : Whole exome sequencing was performed and potentially deleterious variants prioritized by custom ï¬ltering strategies including the use of ORVAL (Oligogenic Resource for Variant Analysis Platform) and enrichment analysis of candidategenes with GeneCodis4. Results : Two cases showed possible deleterious rare variants, each in 3 different genes. A male patient was carrying 2 maternally inherited variants, one hemizygous in BCOR and one heterozygous inMYO9B , genes associated to cognitive and behaviour impair ment. A third heterozygous paternally inherited variant affected HTR1E , a serotonin receptor hypothesized to play a role in autism like behaviour and sleep disturbance. The second case, anothermale patient, had 2 maternally inherited variants, one hemizygousinZC4H2 , associated to developmental delay, and one hetero zygous in ALDH5A1 , associated to behaviour and sleep impair ment. A further paternally inherited variant affected CPLX3 , involved in neurotransmitter release, hypothesized to be impli cated in neurodevelopmental delay. Implicated genes revealed enrichment in ASD associated biological processes and pathways. As our previously described patient, these two patients presentedcomplex ASD phenotype.

Introduction: Kabuki Makeup syndrome (KMS) OMIM 147920 is a rare genetic disease characterized by phenotypic traits, mental retardation, and autistic symptoms. KMS is caused by pathogenicmutations in the genes KMT2D, KDM6A. Mutation of the KMT2Dgene is inherited by autosomal dominant type; mutation of the KDM6A gene is inherited X linked dominantly. Materials and Methods: A clinical case of KMS in a 2 year old girl. Syndromological, ""Face2gene"", cytogenetic, moleculargenetic, instrumental methods of examination were used. Results: Girl from the third planned pregnancy; which was on the background of the threat of miscarriage, polyhydramnios,hypothyroidism. The baby was born at 36 weeks of pregnancy weighing 2930 g, length 49 cm, on the Apgar scale 8/8 points. Phenotype: cleft palate, protruding ear shells, arched eyebrows,long oblique eye slits, blue sclera, epicanthus, ectropion of thelower eyelids, wide tip of the nose, hypoplasia of the nails on the V ï¬ngers of the wrists of the hands, congenital, muscular hypotension, delay of stato kinetic development. Syndromologicaldiagnostics was performed using the diagnostic program ""Face2 gene""; suspected KMS; cytogenetic, molecular genetic research is recommended to verify the diagnosis. Karyotype of a child 46,XX. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic mutation(c.11884C>T) (p.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human disease. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorder. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes.
