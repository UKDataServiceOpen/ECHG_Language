23,443,Preliminary Findings In The Diagnostic Evaluation Of A Sample Of 103 Individuals With Pervasive DevelopmentDisorders,P0341., E. Steiner   M. M. Guerreiro  A. P. Marques de Faria Unicamp  Campinas  B,Pervasive development disorders (PDD) are a heterogeneous group ofneurobehavioral disorders of infancy. In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD  a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation  screening for inborn errors of metabolism  karyotypein folic acid deficient medium  and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation.Until now  the following conditions were detected  Down syndrome (n = 3) untreated phenylketonuria (n = 2)  Rett syndrome (n = 2)  tuberous sclero sis (n = 1)  fragile X syndrome (n = 1)  5 other dysmorphic conditions  2non genetic etiologies  and 2 individuals with chromosomal polymor phisms. Besides those  4 individuals presented no PDD and 3 individualshad infantile psychosis. These data suggest that  in at least 15% of thissample  a main etiologic factor could be identified. Although the diagnosisof a specific genetic condition do not modify the treatment of autistic indi viduals in most cases  it is of significant importance to the genetic coun seling of their relatives. For this reason  we reinforce the importance ofcareful dysmorphologic examination and complementary tests in any per son presenting with PDD  besides neurologic and psychiatric evaluation. ,2001.0,dgmfcm@unicamp.br,,,D a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation screening for inborn errors of metabolism karyotypein folic acid deficient medium and molecular test for the  FR.,,autistic behavior

Brondum NielsenJohn F. Kennedy Institute  Glostrup  D,The subtelomeric regions are often involved in chromosomal rearrange 172 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyments. They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients  all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism  andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found  A 1pter deletion  resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR  growth retardation  and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR  epilepsy microcephaly  and dysmorphism  consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR  microcephaly  an atrial septum defect  and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients.In conclusion three out of 41 (7.3%) patients with idiopathic MR were foundto have subtelomeric rearrangements  in concordance with the prevalence(5 10%) in previous studies. ,2001.0,els@kennedy.dk,,,Two groups of patients all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism andwith at least one other relative affected with autism.,patient with autism,

Even before the causative gene for this syndrome was identified  pedigree studies indicated that it was likely to be an X linked dominantdisorder  with presumed lethality in males. Nonetheless  there were a fewdescriptions of males suspected of having Rett syndrome. These includesporadic cases meeting the clinical inclusion criteria  sporadic males withKlinefelter syndrome (47 XXY)  and males with severe neonatalencephalopathy in known Rett syndrome families. With the recent discov ery that the MECP2 gene on Xq28 is the gene responsible for most casesof Rett syndrome  it is possible to molecularly assess cases suspected ofhaving male Rett syndrome by direct sequencing analysis. We describethe first 4 cases of molecularly confirmed cases of Rett syndrome in Israel.One of the families presented here consists of a female having classicalRett syndrome and a male sibling with severe neonatal encephalopathy.Molecular analysis revealed that both sister and brother have the sameMECP2 gene mutation  however their mother does not  suggestinggermline mosaicism. The case emphasizes the point that maternalgermline mosaicism may lead to affected female or male offspring  whichshould be taken into consideration during genetic counseling regardingrecurrence risks  and suggests that prenatal diagnosis may be warrantedin siblings of apparently sporadic cases of Rett syndrome.

Clas sical RS features seem to occur almost exclusively in females  with an esti mated prevalence of one in 10 000 15 000 female birth. The vast majori ties of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin  and are due to de novomutations. Mutations in the Methyl CpG Binding protein 2 gene have been identified in roughly 75 % of classical Rett girls. We collected DNA samplesfrom 42 Italian classical Rett girls  and screened the MECP2 coding regionfor mutations by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography(DHPLC)  and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently devel oped method for mutation screening combining high sensitivity  reducedcost per run and high throughput. In our study  16 different de novoMECP2 mutations  seven of which were previously unreported  were foundin 32/42 Rett girls (76%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized ina total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identifi cation of 14/16 different mutations (87%)  after optimal conditions wereestablished  this figure increased to 100%  with all recurrent MECP2 muta tions generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Standardizationof DHPLC reagents and methods seems to be critical to the reliability andaccuracy of mutation prediction. Detailed analysis of signature shape retention time  and retention time differences between peaks will allow sig nature based sequence identification  at least for the most commonMECP2 mutations and SNPs. ,2001.0,talycarella@tigem.it,,,Rett  syndrome is an  X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disordercharacterized by several clinical abnormalities such as progressiveencephalopathy autistic behavior and stereotyped hand movements.,,autistic behavior

The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line.

SVAS is an obstructive vascular disorder that causes hemody namically significant narrowing of large arteries. Although the aorta is themost frequently diseased  any artery can be affected  including the pul monary  carotid and coronary arteries. The onset and severity of the vas cular disease in SVAS is variable. If untreated  this disorder can lead toheart failure  myocardial infarction and death. SVAS occurs with an inci dence of 1 in 20 000 life births. It can be inherited as an isolated autoso mal dominant trait or as one symptom of Williams Beuren syndrome  acomplex developmental disorder characterized by cardiovascular  neu robehavioral  facial  connective tissue  and metabolic abnormalities. Innonsyndromic SVAS patients up to now 14 different mutations have beenreported in the Elastin gene. As mutations are distributed all over the gene mutation analysis is time consuming and cost intensive. Therefore weestablished the DHPLC method for mutational screening of all 34 codingexons and flanking introns. In order to reduce false positive heteroduplexformations PCR conditions had to be optimized for DHPLC. Temperatureand buffer gradient conditions were elaborated for each exon to optimizeelution profiles. DHPLC analysis were performed in five unrelated SVASpatients and available family members. Fragments with normal (wild type)sequence were used as controls. We identified the same disease causingmutation (exon 10  K176X) in two non consanguineous patients by DHPLCand sequencing. In addition elution profiles with heteroduplex formationwere observed in 8 out of 34 exons analyzed. Whether these heteroduplexpattern are due to a mutation or a polymorphism have to be proved bysequencing. ,2001.0,cokraus@humgenet.uni,,,autism patients up to now 14 different mutations have beenreported in the  Elastin gene.,,autism patient

It is caused by muta tions in the FGD1 gene located in Xp11.21. Since many X linked mentalretardation (XLMR) conditions localize to a broad region encompassingXp11.2  we began a mutational analysis of XLMR families linked to Xp11.2as well as males from small  unstudied XLMR families. In one affectedmale in the families  a shift in exon 4 of FGD1 was detected by SSCP.Sequence analysis revealed a C1665T change  which gave rise to anamino acid substitution  P312L. The base change was confirmed by StyIdigestion of the altered allele. Analysis of the family indicated the C1665Talteration segregated with XLMR in the family. The C1665T alteration wasnot detected in 250 normal X chromosomes. The phenotype of the affect ed males is non syndromic.

Birk4 1Children s Hospital Research Foundation  Cincinnati  OH United States  2Hospital for Sick Children  Toronto  ON Canada  3University of Iowa  Iowa City  IA United States  4Thomas Jefferson University  Philadelphia  PA United S,"Approximately one third to one half of individuals with classical Ehlers Danlos syndrome (types I/II) have detectable abnormalities in the genesencoding the proa1(V) (COL5A1) or proa2(V) (COL5A2) chains of type Vcollagen  a quantitatively minor component of type I collagen rich fibrils.Electron micrographs of skin from some patients with EDS were reportedto have larger diameter collagen fibrils than control. In general  largerdiameter collagen fibrils correlate directly with structural properties (stiff ness and maximum force) and material properties (modulus and maximumstress) of tissues  yet dermal tissues of classical EDS patients are friableand dermal scars have apparent reduced mechanical strength. To investi gate this apparent paradox  we examined matrix deposition and collagenfibril morphology in long term cultures of fibroblast cell strains that have afourfold difference in the ratio of type V to type I collagen gene expression.Compared to control cells  fibroblasts from 2 patients with OI type I due toCOL1A1 haploinsufficiency deposited 46% of hydroxyproline per mg pro tein and EDS cells from 2 patients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiencydeposited 38%. However  the EDS cells synthesized approximately thesame amount of total collagen as controls and had similar secreted ratiosof type I/type III collagen as control cells. Average collagen fibril diameterfrom EDS cells was 39.6Ã¢\x80\x93 12.5 nanometers compared to 32.6Ã¢\x80\x936.9 nm forcontrol and 25.1Ã¢\x80\x93 5.2 nm for OI cells. These data indicate that type V col lagen may serve a dual function in dermal tissues. In addition to its posit ed role as a negative regulator of collagen fibril diameter  type V collagenmay serve as a rate limiting nucleator of collagen fibrillogenesis in dermis.A reduced rate of collagen fibril formation in the dermis of classical EDSpatients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiency may override any mechanicaladvantage conferred by increased fibril diameter.412 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian DisordersP1588.

Alport syndrome can be caused by mutations in COL4A5  one ofthe six type IV collagen genes. The most common form of the Alport syn drome is an X linked dominant trait that has been associated with the geneof the alpha5 chain of type IV collagen (COL4A5). More than 300 differentmutations have been identified in COL4A5 gene and they appear random ly along the whole gene. We report the first systematic mutation screeningof all 51 exons with boundary intronic sequences of COL4A5 gene by sin gle stranded conformation analysis (SSCA) after amplification of eachexon by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in forty two patientsfrom 16 randomly collected AS suspected families in slovenian population.The nucleotide sequence of all PCR products revealed by the abnormalmobility shift on PCR SSCA was determined by the direct sequencingmethod using dsDNA cycle sequencing system (Perkin Elmer). PCR SSCA of the COL4A5 gene of eight unrelated Alport families showed thepresence of seven different mutations. Seven different mutations wereidentified in 8 families by cycle sequencing. Six of them are to the best ofour knowledge new  G669R (GGT>CGT)  G325R (GGA>CGA)  R266X(CGA>TGA)  G811R (GGA>AGA)  G319D (GGT>GAT) and 1234+17 Tdel. Intronic mutation 1234+17 T del most likely influences the splicing ofmRNA. As previously described (5) mutation G624D(GGT>GAT) has beenidentified in two families.

141,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test  and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and  analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose.  Control hybridizations with normal male to male, male to female and  female to female reference samples were performed and showed  the expected results.

Methods:  Clinical Posters   Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 114 115 manifestation, family data, history of pregnancy, parental age and  anthropometric traits were analysed and compared in two groups of  patients with deletion and mUPD. Cytogenetic analysis was routinely  performed using HRBT in all patients. FISH was done in all cases  which were diagnosed in our genetic unit. Methylation analysis, gene  dosage analysis for SNRPN and polymorphism analysis for loci  within the PWS/AS region are included in our molecular diagnostic  procedure. Results: PWS diagnosis was confirmed by methylation  test in 77 (38%) patients. Among them deletion was detected in 40  (25%) patients, mUPD in 11 (14,2%) and imprinting mutation in 1  (1.3%) patient. Detection of the molecular defect was impossible in  6 (7,8%) patients because of uninformative polymorphism analysis  results.

We are presenting the results of our studies in a serie of 64 female  cases in which we looked for mutations in the MECP2 gene. These  patients were divided into three groups :   Group I (23 patients) with Rett syndrome diagnosed in our  multidisciplinary consultation.   Group II (28 patients) referred by external collaborators for a  suspicion of Rett syndrome   Group III (17 patients) from our center exhibiting a severe  encephalopathy with autistic behaviour. In the first group, 21 mutations were identified ; in the second, 8  mutations and zero in the third group. These results confirm that the  vast majority of mutations in the MECP2 gene lead to a classical Rett  syndrome phenotype. They also show that a large proportion of girls  with a severe mental handicap are not found to be associated with a  MECP2 mutation on the contrary to what was recently proposed in  the litterature. In addition, we did not find any genotype phenotype correlations for  the Rett syndrome patients taking into account the mutation type, the  functional domain affected by the mutation and the X chromosome  inactivation status of these patients except for the mutation involving  the C terminal domain associated with a ÃÂ« forme frustre ÃÂ» of the  disease.

184,876,Mapping of a Candidate Region for Autism on  Chromosome 2q32.,P0787.,,"Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism,  who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of  chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings.

184,876,Mapping of a Candidate Region for Autism on  Chromosome 2q32.,P0787.,,"Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region.

198,1259,The behavioural phenotype of Bardet Biedl  syndrome,P46.,,"Background: Although behavioural characteristics, including disinhibited behaviour ,  an inability to recognise social cues and obsessive and compulsive  tendencies, have been noted in individuals with Bardet Biedl  syndrome (BBS), to date no studies have systematically studied the  behavioural phenotype. Method: Parents of 21 children with BBS seen for a multidisciplinary clinical  assessment completed standardised measures of behaviour. Results: Children with BBS showed elevated levels of internalising problems  including feeling withdrawn and anxious/depressed. They also had  elevated levels of social, thought and attention problems. A significant  minority scored in the clinical range on a measure of autistic  symptoms, although none met clinical diagnostic criteria. The children  also had elevated scores on a measure of repetitive behaviour and  the majority was reported to be obsessive by their parents. Conclusions: These findings indicate considerable clinical need that had been  unmet in many families. Further, they suggest that BBS has a  characteristic behavioural phenotype that may be related to mutation  type. E",2002.0,,"L. Beales1, S. Barnett2, S. Reilly3, L. Carr1, I. Ojo4, T.

217,288,Prevalence of Prader Willy syndrome and  Angelman syndrome in Estonian children,P197.,,"The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of  Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader Willy syndrome (PWS) in  Estonia. In year 2000 we started a focused search for the patients with AS  and PWS. Only 2 patients with AS and 2 patients with PWS were  diagnosed before. The target population consisted of children  referred to the two Children Hospitals or to genetic counselling due to  developmental delay. In addition, we visited all Estonian institutions  for disabled children. The selection of investigated patients based on  the consensus diagnostic criteria for PWS described by Williams et al  (1995), and for AS by Holm et al (1993). The DNA methylation test was carried out in 45 patients with  suspicion of PWS and in 73 patients with suspicion of AS, this test  was positive in 6 and 3 patients, respectively. Patients with positive  test results and previously diagnosed patients were analysed by FISH  and chromosomal analysis. From 8 identified PWS patients 4 had a  deletion in the region 15q11 13, one had a translocation 15;15 and 3  had a matUPD15. From 5 AS patients 4 had a deletion and 1 had a  patUPD15. Two patients with AS were included into study based on  clinical picture only. The preliminary prevalence of PWS and AS in Estonia was estimated  as 1:40000 and 1:46000, respectively.

219,304,Detailed deletion breakpoint mapping alongside  in depth cognitive profiling as a tool to aid genotype  phenotype correlations in Williams Beuren Syndrome,P213.,,"Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a developmental disorder  caused by a hemizygous deletion (~1.5Mb) at chromosome 7q11.23. The phenotype is complex with striking physical, cognitive and  behavioural aspects that include overall IQs in the range of 50 60  alongside an uneven cognitive profile (verbal tasks outstripping  spatial tasks). Physically, WBS phenotypes include a dysmorphic  face, congenital heart disease (typically SVAS), growth retardation,  hyperacusis, premature ageing, and infantile hypercalcaemia. Up  to 25 genes have been identified within the critical region, however,  only hemizygosity for elastin is associated with a phenotype  (SVAS). Therefore, alone or in combination, some of the remaining  deleted genes appear to be responsible for the other features of  WBS. Generally, relations between genotype and phenotype in  WBS are studied at the group level with rather gross measures of  behavioural outcome, yet, much is to be gained by more in depth  cognitive studies. We have performed detailed cognitive analyses  on a number of WBS individuals to identify those which show higher  or lower functioning. One higher functioning patient (WBS HF)  has been genotyped using somatic cell hybrids and compared at  both molecular and cognitive levels with patients exhibiting classic  phenotypes or SVAS, to correlate genotype with phenotype. The  results show that despite above average scores for the syndrome,  WBS HF had the typical uneven profile of WBS and a characteristic  WBS chromosomal deletion. In contrast, the SVAS patients, with a  smaller deletion, displayed a normal profile suggesting that genes at  the telomeric end of the WBS deletion are important in causing the  WBS cognitive profile.",2003.0,,"Tassabehji1, M.

The investigations undertaken have also been scrutinised  to see which are giving a high diagnostic yield. The overall rate for establishibg a firm diagnosis was 29% with an  additional 12% of patients having tentative or partial diagnoses being  made. It is not suprising that a genetics department is not diagnosing  Downs syndrome, but perhaps unexpected that there is only one  case of a microdeletion syndrome in the list of patient diagnoses. Analysis of features evident from initial history of examination  that predict an aetiology being established show the presence of  dysmorphic features and a milder level of delay to be the only factors  with positive predictive value. The presence of autistic features,  positive neurology (inc. microcephaly, macrocephaly, epilepsy) other  system anomalies (eg cardiac etc)were all found not to have any  predictive value in whether or not a firm diagnosis would be made.

BHF probably affects at least 1% of the population and  is characterized by persistent microscopic glomerular hematuria,  sometimes with proteinuria or hypertension, thinning of the  glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and normal renal function.  Considering the similarities in GBM abnormalities, TBMD cannot be  clinically differentiated from the initial stages of AS. It has recently  been suggested that TBMD represents a carrier state of autosomal  recessive or X linked AS. We analyzed 22 patients with confirmed  BHF and 12 AS patients who had tested negative in COL4A5 gene  screening also for COL4A4 mutations. Non isotopic single stranded  conformation analysis (SSCA) after amplification of each exon with  boundary intronic sequences by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  was used for all 51 exons of COL4A5 and 47 exons of COL4A4  gene. While no mutation was identified in COL4A5 gene in all 34  patients COL4A4 mutation screening disclosed eleven common  polymorphisms that are shared in part with other populations and  six novel mutations: G774R (GGT>CGT), G789G (GGA>GGT),  2860+2T>G, R908W (CGG>GGG), D1049H (GAC>CAC)+del 5 bp,  3506 8T>G and 4081 8G>C comprising three missense mutations,  one frameshift and two potentially splice site mutations.

With both polymorphisms in patients and controls  there was no prevalence of any specific genotype, but there was a  predominance of the long allele (12 and L).There was no difference  in genotype and allelic frequency between the autistic group versus  mothers, fathers, or mothers and fathers. Confirming previous study  we observed a preferential 12/12 genotype in patients with mothers  carrying the same genotype. In both populations 5 HTTLPR and  5 HTTVNTR were in concordance, and there was a predominance  of long allele (L and 12), but although not significative, the difference Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism224 225 between frequency of L and S in patients was bigger. Conclusions. In this study we did no found any association of autism  with both polymorphisms in serotonin transporter gene. The existence  of a preferential 12/12 genotype in autistic individuals with mothers  carrying the same genotype was confirmed.

There have been occasional reports of hyperphosphatasia associated with progressive postnatal neurodevelopmental disease and seizures (MIM#239300). Affected children exhibit consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) of uncertain origin. There are no other laboratory Ã¯Â¬Ândings of note and no evidence of any abnormality of bone or liver metabolism, or altered skeletal architecture. Affected siblings and/or consanguinity suggest autosomal recessive inheritance, but the underlying pathogenesis is  unknown.We describe a new case and review the clinical features in the context of 16 previously reported children. Our proband is a 5ÃÂ½ yr old girl born to consanguineous parents, who presented with marked developmental delay and dysmorphic features (brachycephaly, coarse facies, hypertelorism, bulbous nose with prominent nasal bridge, and downturned corners of the mouth) at Ã¯Â¬Âve months of age. Subsequently, failure to thrive, acquired microcephaly, and autistic behaviours were observed. Seizures and an abnormal EEG were also seen. The hyperphosphatasia (867ÃÂ±72 IU/L, n=7) is associated with decreased pyridoxal 5Ã¢ÂÂ phosphate (B 6), and the question of aberrant vitamin  B6 metabolism has been raised in this condition before. Pyridoxine  challenge (100 mg bolus) resulted in normalized EEG activity. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs tonic clonic and absence seizures have not been evident since phenobarbital withdrawal and treatment with 100 mg pyridoxine daily. Our case illustrates two points: 1) alkaline phosphatase should be assayed in children presenting with similar Ã¯Â¬Ândings; 2) pyridoxine EEG challenge should be attempted to determine whether other affected children show pyridoxine responsiveness.",2005.0,,"M.

His world remains limited to a biunivocal relation with the mother, that lasts longer than the other children, so remaining in a condition of passivity and greatest dependence. He understands he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt overtake the daily problems without help. He reacts isolating from the real life, taking refuge in a fantastic world. He closes himself in a autistic passivity as the only answer to his own inadequacy.

312,955,Results of molecular genetic analyses in the group of  probands with the Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes,P0841.,,"The Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes are two distinct  multisystem disorders in the chromosomal region 15q11 q13, the genetic background of these disorders is complex and they are caused by absence of expression of the paternal (PWS) and maternal (AS)  active genes.We analyzed 99 PWS and 86 AS suspected probands in our study. We applied following methods for investigation: microsatellite analysis (loci: LS6 CA (D15S113), GABRB3 and IR4 3R (D15S11)) with all patients, methylation analysis with 80 PWS or AS patients and FISH  analysis with UPD suspected cases.We identiÃ¯Â¬Âed 29 of 99 (29 %) positive PWS probands with the following distribution: 20 deletions (69 %), 6 uniparental maternal heterodisomies (21 %), 2 uniparental maternal isodisomies (7 %). In 1 case, the absence of paternal 15q11 q13 region was excluded by STR analysis, but methylation analysis showed inadequate methylation  pattern, identifying the imprinting mutation (3 %).We detected 20 of 86 (23 %) positive AS probands with the following distribution: 18 (90 %) deletion forms, 1 (5 %) uniparental paternal isodisomy and 1 trisomy of chromosome 15 (5 %). Besides, we detected a recombination between loci LS6 CA (D15S113) and GABR B3 in 1 suspected case with AS. This case is still being analyzed.Our results agree with other published data.

Standard cytogenetic analysis  revealed that he carried a de novo  apparently balanced translocation,  t(1;5)(q23;q22). Searching for cryptic chromosome abnormalities, YAC  clones in the region of the chromosomal breakpoints were selected and used as FISH probes . The patient showed a deletion in chromosome 1 from q23 .3 to q24 .2, with a loss of about 8 Mb . In an attempt to further  characterize the deletion, with the aim to delineate a better genotype  phenotype correlation, whole genome screening was conducted using array based CGH analysis, at a resolution of 75 kb . The array CGH  data confirmed a cryptic deletion in the q23.3 to q24.2 region, without  other imbalances. The breakpoints were better refined and the size of the deletion was evaluated in 4 .97 Mb . When an individual carries an apparently balanced de novo   rearrangement, the risk for phenotypic abnormalities is significantly  higher than for an individual who has inherited a similar rearrangement from a normal parent .

In  a previous study we identified different GAS6  SNPs and found an  association between c .834+7G>A, in intron 8, and stroke . The purpose  of the present study was to analyze the association between specific  GAS6  haplotypes and disease in a population of 656 stroke patients  (457 ischemic and 199 hemorrhagic) and 150 healthy controls .Genotyping was performed by use of different PCR based methods .  The THESIAS program was used to measure linkage disequilibrium and haplotype frequencies . Results:  Genotype and haplotype analysis revealed that the  c .834+7AA genotype was found associated with protection from stroke  (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.32 0.89). After adjustment for known vascular  risk factors, this association was maintained for the atherothrombosis  related (atherosclerotic, lacunar and deep ICH) strokes and it was even  stronger when the c.834+7A allele was present in a specific haplotype  (CACA) of four GAS6 polymorphisms (c .280+170C>G, c .712+26G>A,  c .713 155T>C, c .834+7G>A) . The prevalence of the CACA haplotype was 9 .7%, 11 .8% and 14 .6%, respectively in patients with ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and in controls . After adjustment for  known vascular risk factors, the CACA haplotype was independently associated with ischemic stroke (OR 0 .48 [0 .28 0 .83]), as well as with atherothrombotic strokes (OR 0 .43 [0 .24 0 .79]) .conclusions:  The AA genotype of the GAS6 c .834+7 G>A SNP  and more strongly the GAS6 CACA haplotype are associated with  protection from ischemic and, atherothrombosis related strokes .

419,1234,Evaluation of ms mLPA for molecular diagnosis of  Prader Willi and Angelman syndrome in a clinical context,P1218.,,"Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) are distinct syndromes  characterized by developmental impairment, caused by loss of  expression of imprinted genes in the paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) chromosomal region 15q11 q13 . Molecular genetic testing is important  to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to predict the familial recurrence  risk which depends on the underlying molecular mechanism [deletion  (in 75% of PWS and AS cases), uniparental disomy (UPD), an imprinting error or point mutations] . In most diagnostic laboratories methylation specific PCR or Southern blot analysis is used . Additional testing (FISH, UPD analysis) is required to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism . An ideal molecular test  should provide information about both parent specific methylation imprinting on 15q11 q13 and the underlying genetic mechanism .  Recently, methylation specific multiplex ligation dependent probe  amplification (MS MLPA) became commercially available. This  technique allows detection of changes in CpG methylation and copy number of chromosomal sequences in a single reaction . We evaluated this technique for diagnostic applications in a clinical setting . Using MS MLPA we tested a group of 16 patients with  previously confirmed PWS (7) and AS (9) respectively. The molecular  diagnosis and underlying molecular mechanism were confirmed in all cases . A comparison was made between MS MLPA and Southern blot results . We conclude that MS MLPA is a powerful technique, suitable for molecular diagnostics of PWS/AS in a clinical context .  MS MLPA has important advantages compared to other techniques  as starting from genomic DNA, information about methylation status  and underlying molecular mechanism is provided within in a single experiment, resulting in a shorter turnover time .",2006.0,,"Claes , K.

426,90,Activating SOS1 mutations cause Noonan syndrome,C36.,,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a relatively common, genetically heteroge   neous Mendelian trait characterized by short stature, facial dysmor   phisms, congenital heart defects and skeletal anomalies. Accumulat   ing evidence supports the idea that NS is caused by enhanced RAS  MAPK signaling. Indeed, gain of function mutations in PTPN11, the  gene encoding SHP 2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that positively  controls RAS signaling, and KRAS have been documented in 50%  of NS cases. Here, we demonstrate that approximately 20% of NS  patients without PTPN11 or KRAS mutation have missense mutations  in SOS1, which encodes a RAS specific guanine nucleotide exchange  factor (GEF). SOS1 mutations cluster at residues implicated in the  maintenance of SOS1 in its autoinhibited form and expression of two  NS associated mutants induced enhanced RAS and ERK activation.  The phenotype associated with SOS1 defects is distinctive, although  within NS spectrum, with a high prevalence of ectodermal abnormali   ties but generally normal development and linear growth.

Furthermore the boy suffers from seizures since the age of 16 years.  Intelligence is in normal range. The patient finished non classical secondary school with good marks.  Afterwards he tried to graduate from expert school for social sciences which could not be  completed because of his special defects in social competence and  communication skills, and his deficiency of empathy which, at the end  of the initiated diagnostic procedure, led to the diagnosis of Asperger  autism.

Furthermore we could confirm this result with FISH using the probe  GABRB3 (15q11 12),which showed three signals on meta  and inter   phase chromosomes. Parental investigations (FISH and molecular analysis) were inconspic   uous.

Among the three genes of the minimal critical region (from  centromere to telomere: SHANK3 , ACR  and RABL2B ), SHANK3  is  considered to be at the origin of the neurobehavioral symptoms. We report a child with a de novo  interstitial 22q13.3 deletion detected  by MLPA and confirmed by FISH. She demonstrates mental retardation, severe speech delay, epicanthic  fold, and protruding ears with normal growth. This non specific pheno   type is concordant with the classical presentation of 22q13.3 deletion  syndrome. Subtelomeres analysis by MLPA showed a discrepancy between the  P036B and P070 kits (MCR Holland): P070 MLPA probe (targeting  ARSA  gene) showed a deletion but P036B (targeting RABL2B  gene)  showed a normal result. FISH analysis using LSI TUPLE1 /LSI ARSA   (Vysis) probes confirmed deletion of ARSA , whereas FISH with N25/ N85A3 (Cytocell) probes, targeting SHANK3  locus was normal. This  was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR of exons 23 and 24 of  SHANK3 . Supplemented FISH analysis using BAC clones were per   formed to delineate both breakpoint regions of the interstitial deletion.

480,781,Analysis of molecular defects in Polish Angelman  Syndrome patients,P0646.,,"Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a rare neurogenetic disorder that is  caused by impaired UBE3A  gene expression resulting from changes  in the parental genomic imprinting or specific mutations. Four known  types of molecular defects might be responsible for the AS: deletion  of 15q11 q13 region, paternal uniparental disomy, imprinting defects  or UBE3A  mutations. The imprinting defects may result from micro   deletion of the imprinting center or somatic mosaicism. The aim of the  study was the identification of molecular defect in the patients with  clinical manifestation of AS. Two hundred twelve patients with clinical symptoms of AS were in   cluded in the study. First, the analysis of imprinting defect was done  with PCR based DNA methylation analysis of PW71  and SNRPN  loci  (MS PCR). When the mosaic methylation pattern was detected, the  quantitative methylation assay (QAMA) has been performed (28 cas  Molecular and biochemical basis of disease1 es).

However an association  of APOE 22QQ with ADRB2 Arg16Arg among patients with EAH that  significantly increases a risk was found (OR=6,82, P=0,01).

493,985,Mutations in the MECP2 gene in patients of Slavonic  origin with Rett syndrome,P0852.,,"Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder  affecting almost exclusively females. It has an incidence of 1:10,000  female births and is characterized by apparently normal development  for the first 6 18 months of life followed by the loss of acquired motor  and language skills, autistic features, and development of stereotypic  hand movements. Rett syndrome is caused primarily by de novo mu   tations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Methyl  CpG binding protein 2 plays important roles in the regulation of gene  expression and RNA splicing. Here we report the mutational analysis  of the MECP2 gene in 95 patients from the Czech and Slovak Repub   lics and the Ukraine with classical Rett syndrome. The patients, all  girls, were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing of the entire  coding sequence and the exon/intron boundaries of the MECP2 gene.  RFLP analysis was performed to confirm the mutations that cause the  creation or abolition of the restriction site. Mutation negative cases  were subsequently examined by multiple ligation dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) to identify large deletions. Sequencing analysis  revealed 33 different mutations in 74 patients, and MLPA analysis re   vealed large deletions in two patients. The detection rate was 78%.  One mutation in exon 1 (c.48_55del8) has not been published yet.

However, the role of serotonin receptors in its pathophisiology still re   mains poorly understood. In this study, we present results from a case  control association study within 14 polymorphisms in five serotonin  receptors genes (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR2A, HTR2C).

HÃÂ´pital Farhat Hached, Sous  se, Tunisia, 3Service de Psychiatrie. HÃÂ´pital Fattouma Bourguiba, Monastir,  Tunisia. Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a complex neurobehavioral disorder as   sociated with loss of function of differentially expressed imprinted gene  at the region 15q11 q13. It is a rare disorder. It occurs in one of 20  000 live births. It is due either to a microdeletion in the 15q11 locus  (65 75%), or to uniparental disomy (5%), or to UBE3a gene mutations  (10%), or to an anomaly of printing center (5%). In the 10% remainders  cases, the cause still unknown. The molecular study of the patients appear with a great importance  with an aim of being able to conclude about the parental origin and,  therefore, about the disease. In this work, we developed an experimental protocol able to ensure  the molecular detection of this pathology. It is based on the MS MLPA  technique (Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe  Amplification), which is able to detect abnormal methylation of imprint   ed genes as well as deletion occurring at 15q11 q13 locus. The study  of STRs markers of chromosome 15 allowed us to distinguish between  uniparental disomy and microdeletion when abnormal methylation was  detected. These two complementary techniques allowed us to study 8 suspected  AS patients. Only one of them showed a deletion in the 15q11 q13  region. This anomaly was confirmed with FISH (Fluorescent In Situ  Hybridysation). The combination of these two techniques, in the diagnosis of AS,  represents a very good strategy to find more than 85% of causative  anomalies.

543,259,cADHERiN 11 as a possible candidate gene for autism,P01.247,,"Child Psychiatry, Leuven,  Belgium, 3University Center for Child and Youth Psychiatry, Antwerp, Belgium. Background: Positional cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in autism  patients is a valuable strategy towards the identification of candidate  genes, especially in isolated autism, and when the aberration is de novo and family history is negative for autism . (1) Objectives:  We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ  of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods:  1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro   scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON   SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat   ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the  AK13094  gene, another was near GFOD  and RANBP10  . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11   gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11  is expressed in  the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses .

She also presented severe  mental retardation, absence of speech, autistic features, gait difficul   ties with ataxia, hyperventilation episodes, and epileptic seizures . The  second case, a 4 year old boy, was referred to our department for psy   chomotor retardation . He had Ã¢ÂÂhappy puppetÃ¢ÂÂ appearance, ataxic gait, and severe mental retardation . Both children were born from healthy non consanguineous parents . Clinical investigations included neurological evaluation, EEG, and MRI . Chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lympho   cytes, by GTG banding. Locus specific BAC probes for critical region 15q11 13 and control probes were used for FISH analysis . Normal karyotype, and 15q microdeletion was demonstrated in both cases . In the second case, the phenotype was highly suggestive for Angel   man syndrome, while in the first case, a differential diagnosis with Rett  syndrome was considered, especially because of the severe vertebral scoliosis .

557,438,Laboratory progress in molecular diagnosis of Prader Willi  syndrome and Angelman syndrome   A new strategy by  methylation specific competitive multiplex PCR,P02.056,,"Introduction: Most of the Prader Willi syndrome and Angelman syn   drome patients are caused by the deletion of chromosomal 15q11 13 or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 . There are many diagnostic  tools available like the FISH analysis, methylation based PCR, multi   plex PCR, High Resolution Melting analysis and commercialized MS MLPA . Each of them has some disadvantages and limitations such as  high costs, time consuming and requiring DNA bisulfite treatment. We  introduce a novel, in house designed methylation specific competitive  multiplex PCR, which takes three hours for the reaction, avoids bisul   fite treatment of DNA and provides reliable results of PWS and AS. Material and methods: 68 patients with clinical suspicion of PWS, two  with AS, and 20 unaffected individuals from the general population  were analyzed. In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, we amplified  one SNRPN control gene, the KRITI gene to serve as internal control,  and the promoter of the SNRPN gene, which could be digested them with HhaI enzyme . By comparing the copy number of the three re   gions, we could differentiate the wild type, deletion type and UPD type PWS within one reaction . We also evaluated other different diagnostic technologies in clinical applications . Results: In this article, we successfully made the molecular diagno   sis of one AS patients and 46 PWS patients by several different tech   niques . In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, the total copy numbers were accurately calculated in all of the cases . Conclusions: The MS competitive multiplex PCR strategy is a good al   ternative for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS . This approach could  serve as an alternative genotyping platform for epigenetics .",2008.0,,"S. Y. Lin , C. H. Lin, Y. N.

ASD occurs in syndromic  forms and as non syndromic cases frequently involving cytogenetic abnormalities . Recently, array based genome wide screens have demonstrated frequent copy number variation in non syndromic ASD .  Screening 56 patients with autism and additional major or minor anom   alies with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP platform (Illumina, Inc.,  San Diego, CA) we found in 16 patients 9 regions with deleted and 9 with duplicated signals . Aberrant signals were distributed among 16 distinct chromosomal loci . Apart from 14 patients with unique aberra   tions, 2 patients carried duplications and a 3rd patient a deletion within  the 22q11 region, of 0 .726, 2 .966, and 0 .388 Mb, respectively  . The  duplications were confirmed by multiplex ligation mediated probe am   plification and are likely to involve LCRs A, B and D. We conclude that  SNP array based screening of ASD patients uncovers an appreciable  number of CNVs, which in part overlap with loci already discovered by  other approaches. Our finding that 3 out of 56 ASD patients carried aberrations within the 22q11 region is highly unexpected .

KRAS  and BRAF  were analyzed by sequencing . 40%  (26/65) of the samples carried a mutation in KRAS , 22% (14/64) in  BRAF , and 13% (3/24) in NF1 . We found that 62% (40/65) of the sam   ples had alterations in one or more of the components, meaning they have a dysregulation of the RAS pathway  .  BRAF  and KRAS  mutations  were mutually exclusive . BRAF  mutation was strongly associated with  microsatellite instability (MSI), female gender, and proximal location .  Among the 24 samples analyzed for mutations in NF1, we found 2  missense and 2 splicing mutations . All NF1 mutations occurred in MSI,  proximal, and female derived tumors with BRAF  mutation . In addition,  we found that 3 of the samples had duplication of parts or the whole  NF1 gene . In conclusion RAS pathway is dysregulated by mutually  exclusive mutations of KRAS  and BRAF  in the majority of CRC . We  show that the activity of RAS signaling is likely to be enhanced in more  than 10% of the tumors since they harbor mutations in both BRAF  and  NF1 .",2008.0,,"I. Bottillo1, I. Torrente1, T.

As an example, we used publicly available data from two type 2 diabe   tes (T2D) GWAS; the Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) and the Well   come Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) . Of the 1,179 SNPs  in the DGI dataset and the 1,712 SNPs in the WTCCC dataset that showed association with T2D with a p value lower than 0 .003, we were  able to map 559 and 797 SNPs, respectively, to genomic loci that con   tained one or more genes . Prioritizer then selected the most promising  gene(s) from each locus based on their functional interactions with genes on the other loci . We used PANTHER to assign each of the  selected genes to a specific pathway and to test whether we saw more genes in each pathway than expected . Our results showed that the Ã¢ÂÂinflammation mediated by chemokine and  cytokine signalingÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂWnt signalingÃ¢ÂÂ pathways were consistently the most strongly overrepresented in the T2D data .

In particular, the 15q13.3 microdeletion has been identi   fied in 0.2 0.3% of individuals with mental retardation and epilepsy,  schizophrenia, autism and other neuropsychiatric features. The criti   cal region between BP4 and BP5 contains at least seven genes, in   cluding CHRNA7 , which is considered a good candidate gene for the  epilepsy phenotype. We report a series of 11 patients (8 index cases  and 3 affected parents) presenting a developmental delay and a 1.5  Mb 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion ascertained through 11 French  CGH array platforms. All 8 index cases presented mild to moderate  mental retardation with absent or non specific dysmorphic features.  Only two had seizures, 4 had an abnormal electroencephalogram and  none had an autistic behaviour. One patient presented a highly differ   ent phenotype, including hydrocephaly, joint dislocations, congenital  lymphoedema and notable dysmorphic features associated to men   tal retardation. Familial studies could be performed in 5/8 index pa   tients. Interestingly, all 15q13.3 microdeletions were inherited (3 from  the mother, 2 from the father). The affected parents had mild mental  retardation with epilepsy in one. In particular, the microdeletion was  found in 2 completely asymptomatic mothers. This study is in favour  of incomplete penetrance and more variable clinical expressivity than  previously published. Therefore, the 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion  might be only considered as a risk factor for mental retardation.

We  propose a simple method for the joint (re )analysis of multiple SNPs,  based on published summary data. Our approach is based on two  observations. Firstly, finemapping studies are focused, by design, on  a limited number of moderately to strongly correlated SNPs. All test   ed SNPs are expected to reflect the true association of the unknown  causal variant proportional to their LD with it, in concordance with the  Ã¢ÂÂFundamental Theorem of the HapMapÃ¢ÂÂ. Secondly, given such corre   lated SNP data it has been suggested before that a joint analysis of all  markers together is most powerful for detecting a true association. A  closer examination of the results reported in the GWAS study reveals  that the data indeed concur with the Ã¢ÂÂTheorem of the HapMapÃ¢ÂÂ. Based  on the above we re analyzed the replication data using a novel joint  test of association and conclude and the results strongly favors Piccolo  to be a causal risk factor for major depression.

651,82,Development of molecular pathways analysis of GWAs data:  application to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,C05.5,,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide substantially  greater potential to detect common risk variants of modest effect in  complex disorders than previous positional cloning methodologies. A  major criticism has been that these studies have, to date, explained  only a small fraction of predicted heritability despite large sample sizes  and genome wide SNP coverage. The joint action of common variants  within pathways may play a major role in predisposing to complex ge   netic disorders, where multiple genes may contribute to susceptibility.  Thus, there is a pressing need to develop more sophisticated mining  techniques to identify biologically meaningful signals in data gener   ated by GWAS. Molecular pathways  or systems based approaches  to mining complex GWAS are currently gaining prominence. Here we  describe a novel SNP ratio test (SRT) that compares the observed  to expected ratios of significant to non significant SNPs within versus  outside of pathways using GWAS data. In a recent GWAS we reported  evidence that possibly thousands of common genetic variants of small  effect contribute substantially to variance in both schizophrenia and  bipolar disorder susceptibility. We now report a two stage molecular  pathways analysis testing 212 experimentally validated molecular  pathways using discovery (International Schizophrenia Consortium  (ISC); n,6,909) and validation (Genetic Association Information Net   work (GAIN); n,2,729)) schizophrenia case control samples.

656,108,Genome wide association scan for bilirubin levels in a sardinian  population,C10.4,,"Bilirubin is the final product of heme degradation. Unconjugated bili   rubin is transported into hepatocytes, where it is glucuronidated by  UGT1A1  and secreted into the bile canaliculi in its conjugated form.  Recent studies have shown that elevated bilirubin levels in adults are  inversely associated with the risk of developing coronary artery disease  and directly with gallstones, while unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia  may be associated with susceptibility to drug toxicity. The genetic fac   tors so far identified cannot fully explain the trait heritability, estimated  to be around 45%. To identify additional loci, we conducted a genome  wide association scan (GWAS) in 4300 Sardinians from the SardiNIA  project, genotyped using the Affymetrix 500K and 10K Arrays, and  evaluated the additive effect of 362,129 SNPs that passed quality con   trol tests. The GWAS results revealed, in addition to two known loci, UGT1A1  (p,6.2x10 62) and G6PD  (p,2.5x10 8), a strong association on  chromosome 12p12.2 (p,3.9x10 9). The findings were replicated in an  independent sample of 1860 Sardinians and in 832 Amish individuals  from the HAPI Heart Study (overall pvalue<5x10 14). Interestingly, we  observed in all three cohorts that the association with unconjugated  bilirubin was stronger than with conjugated bilirubin. Finally, we found  an enrichment of the high bilirubin levels allele at 12p12.2 in patients  with idiopathic mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia lacking mutations  in the UGT1A1  gene, suggesting that this locus may be involved in  the regulation of serum bilirubin levels in the general population and  in some bilirubin related disorders that are only partially explained by  variants in previously identified loci.",2009.0,,"S.

In silico splicing simulation produced new  acceptor splice sites, thus probably affecting the correct splicing. Patient #301 displayed craniofacial anomalies with severe short stat   ure, pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic myocardiopathy, moderate  developmental delay, and severe linfatic dysplasia. PTPN11 gene  analysis revealed the presence of a de novo single codon double  nucleotyde substitution (p.T73L) that produces an aminoacidic change  not previously reported.

Born at term with normal growth parameters, he demonstrated since  the age of 6 months, growth and weight retardation. Delay in motor  milestones was observed as the child did not sit alone at 9 months. He  had also reduced social interactions. G banding showed the presence of a supernumerary chromosome  (47,XY,+mar), composed, as revealed by high resolution aCGH, of  27 Mb from region 9p24.3 to 9p21.2 and 12,3 Mb from 15q11.2 to  15q13.3. This derivative chromosome [der(15)t(9;15)(p21.2;q13.3)]  was subsequently found to derive from a maternal reciprocal trans   location, very likely originating from a meiotic missegregation of 3:1  tertiary type. Partial trisomy 9p21.2 9pter is not well defined but two patients with an  intrachromosomal duplication of chromosome arm 9p [dup(9)(p21p24)]  demonstrated classical clinical manifestations of 9p trisomy with, in  one case, features overlapping with Coffin Siris syndrome. Duplication of the 15q Prader Willi /Angelman syndrome region is  mainly associated with autistic behavior, mental retardation and de   velopmental delay. Most reported cases with associated clinical symp   toms have been linked to extra copies of 15q11 q13 from maternal  origin, paternally derived duplications being generally associated with  a normal phenotype. Our results also support this observation. Presence of potential extra copies of numerous genes from chromo   some 9p in addition to the duplicated 15q region renders a clinical  prognosis difficult.

We are conducting a 5 year longitudinal study on the natural history  of AS, to improve our understanding of the complications, morbidity  and neurodevelopment in AS. We present the baseline clinical data  that describes characteristics of the first 102 subjects enrolled in our  study. Methods: All subjects were between 5 months and 26 years old. Sub   jects were evaluated by detailed history, physical examination, stan   dardized neurodevelopmental assessments, and electroencephalo   grams (EEG). Deletions were sized using a chromosome 15 specific  comparative genomic hybridization microarray. Results: The median age of the 102 subjects was 36 months (80%  were between 17 months and 60 months). 74% of subjects had dele   tions, 15% had either imprinting defects or uniparental disomy, and  12% had UBE3A  mutations. The most common findings were mouth   ing behavior in 93%, short attention span in 91%, microcephaly in 81%,  sleep difficulties in 79%, ataxic or broad based gait in 78%, fascination  with water in 75%, and inappropriate laughter was observed in 62% of  subjects. Clinical seizures were reported in 69% of subjects, although  all EEGs were abnormal. Data on the variations in these characteris   tics by molecular subtype will be presented. Conclusions: In children with AS, it is the neurobehavioral phenotype,  rather than the dysmorphic features or seizures, that is most char   acteristic.

These were iden   tified by either array based MLPA or by array CGH/oligonucleotide  analysis in a series of patients with idiopathic mental retardation with  an estimated population frequency of 1:13.000 1:20.000. Interchromo   somal recombination is the preferred exchange mechanism by which  the duplication arises. The CYLN2  gene within the duplicated region  is approximately 2 times overexpressed in carriers of the duplication.  The expression of the GTF2I  gene, just on the boundary of the dupli   cated region and thus with only 2 intact copies present in patients, was  also significantly increased. Variable speech delay is a constant finding in our patient group, con   firming previous reports. Cognitive abilities range from normal to mod   erate mental retardation. The association with autism is present in five  patients and in one father who also carries the duplication. There is  an increased incidence of hypotonia and congenital anomalies: heart  defects (PDA), diaphragmatic hernia, cryptorchidism and non spe   cific brain abnormalities on MRI.

723,970,Pharmacogenetic investigation in complex traits using Genome Wide Association study,P08.51,,"Pharmacogenetic association studies help to identify DNA variants  which impact on the individual response to drugs. The knowledge of  sample variability in drug response can allow to personalize drug dos   ing and treatment regimes. The fundamental question concerns wheth   er it is possible to differentiate the patients with potentially responses  to the treatment (R) from those with the greatest risk of no response  (NR). Our approach to these questions is to identify SNPs that segre   gate with drug efficacy either in candidate genes (CG) that relate to the  mechanism of action of the drug or in other DNA regions detected with  a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). SNPs identified from CG  or GWAS could allow NR to be excluded from subsequent clinical trial  studies, therefore allowing enriched, smaller, faster, less expensive  clinical studies on patients with a better chance of responding favor   ably. Here, we present an example of this approach: we adopted a  genetic association design, where the phenotype of interest was mea   sured as a quantitative trait and the variables affecting the distribution  of the phenotype are the SNPs, the therapy and the SNP*therapy in   teraction. Once we identified those genes, we developed an algorithm  to detect the genotypic profiles that best discriminate R from the NR.  In a final step, we merged the best predictive SNPs found from our  GWAS strategy with those from a CG approach. Both categories of  SNPs convey a specific predictive power that is magnified by their joint  integration into a unified model.",2009.0,,"E. Salvi1, C. Barlassina1, L. Citterio2, C. Lanzani2, S.

Aim: To perform a comprehensive association analysis of genetic  markers reported by the two previous GWAS studies [1,2] to further  characterize the CD and UC associations in a Lithuanian case control  sample set. Material And Methods: A set of 43 SNPs from three different categories  were selected: (1) 6 SNPs reported by Rioux et al.; (2) 12 SNPs   Ã¢ÂÂnon  convergingÃ¢ÂÂ CD markers and (3) 25 SNPs  Ã¢ÂÂconvergingÃ¢ÂÂ CD markers  reported by WTCCC and replicated by Parkes et.al..

Two variants, CYP2C9*2  and *3, have reduced cata   lytic activity. We studied the impact of these variants on the activity  of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) in two cohorts of  hypertensive subjects. The GENRES Study consisted of 219 hypertensive Finnish men, aged  35 to 60 years, who were treated with four different antihypertensive  monotherapies for four weeks. Baseline laboratory values were mea   sured at the end of the first placebo period.

The gene encodes a highly  conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and  function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak   ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have  been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010.0,,S.

775,24,From Galton to GWAs: the genetic architecture of  complex traits,S04.1,,"Common complex disease is caused by a combination of multiple  genes and environmental effects. Traditionally the genetics of disease  has been studied using concepts that refer to the combined effect of  all genes (e.g., heritability or sibling risk), for example by studying the  recurrence risk or phenotypic correlation of relatives. Genome wide  association studies (GWAS) facilitate the dissection of heritability into  individual locus effect. They have been successful in finding many  SNPs associated with complex traits and have greatly increased the  number of genes where variation is known to affect the trait. How   ever, GWAS have been criticised for not explaining more of the genetic  variation that we know exists in the population, and many hypotheses  have been put forward to explain the missing heritability. The most  plausible explanations are that (i) causal effects are too small to be de   tected with statistical significance and (ii) causal variants are not well  tagged by the SNPs on the commercial arrays, for example because  their minor allele frequency (MAF) is lower than genotyped SNPs. Ge   netic linkage and association analyses are typically implemented as  a genome scan, i.e. by generating and testing multiple hypotheses.  Such approaches, in particular GWAS based upon SNP markers suf   fer from a high false negative rate because of the use of stringent  false positive thresholds. The use of all GWAS data simultaneously in  an estimation rather than hypothesis testing framework is a powerful  alternative to hypothesis testing. We show how such whole genome  methods can be used to better understand the genetic architecture of  complex traits, with applications in height and psychiatric disorders. In  particular, we show that using genome wide marker data can provide  unbiased estimates of narrow sense heritability and that GWAS SNP  data to estimate additive covariance between Ã¢ÂÂunrelatedÃ¢ÂÂ individuals  can uncover much more of the genetic variance than methods that rely  on hypothesis testing.",2010.0,,P.

Several  sources of evidence suggest strong a genetic component in the sus  ceptibility to ASDs; for instance, there are much higher concordance  rates for ASDs in monozygotic twins (92%) than dizygotic twins (10%),  while recent estimates for the sibling recurrence risk is greater than  15. Although ASDs are highly heritable disorders, they exhibit hetero   geneous clinical symptoms and genetic architecture which have hin   dered identification of common genetic susceptibility factors.

785,75,*  Genetic variation in 22 loci influences QRS complex  duration,C03.4,,"QRS complex duration, an ECG measurement reflecting ventricular  depolarization, is associated with risk of heart failure, sudden death  and mortality. The trait is known to have a heritable component (h2  ranging from 20   40%), however few genes influencing the trait have  been identified to date. In the current study, a large scale fixed ef   fects inverse variance weighted meta analysis of GWAS data from 16  studies consisting of >40,000 individuals of European ancestry was  performed. More than 2.5 million SNPs were imputed using the Hap   Map reference panel. Genomic control inflation factors were used to  correct the test statistics at the individual population level as well as  the final meta analysis results. 612 SNPs achieved genome wide sig   nificance levels (P<5e 8). These SNPs represented 30 independent  association signals (r2<0.05) in 22 distinct genomic regions, of which  only four were previously reported. These loci included genes in rel   evant cardiac conduction pathways, including sodium channels (SC   N10A and SCN5A), calcium handling (PLN/SLC35F1, STRN/HEAT   R5B, CASQ2, TKT/CACNA1D, and PRKCA), and transcription factors  (NFIA, HAND1, TBX3, TBX5, TBX20, and KLF12), in addition to novel  pathways (including kinase inhibition and growth factor related genes).  Multiple SNPs demonstrated pleiotropic effects with other ECG traits  reflecting atrial conduction (PR interval) and myocardial repolarization  (QT interval). Further, we showed experimentally that SCN10A, a gene  in our most significantly associated region, is expressed preferentially  in the mouse ventricular conduction system and affects mouse QRS  interval duration. These analyses greatly expand our understanding  of the genetic basis for variation in QRS duration and provide insights  into the biology of cardiac conduction.",2010.0,,"A. Isaacs1, N.

793,117,*  A novel approach to analysis of raw illumina microarray  data to assess the contribution of copy number variations to  obesity and gene expression,C10.6,,"Introduction: Obesity is a major contributor to ill health worldwide. Exploration of the  genetic contribution to obesity using genome wide approaches has re   vealed both SNP and CNV associations. Here, we have used a novel  approach to analysis of microarray derived GWAS data to assess the  contribution of CNVs to obesity and gene expression. Subjects and Methods: The SOS SibPair cohort consists of 154 nuclear families (732 indi   viduals), each containing a body mass index discordant sib pair (Ã¢ÂÂ¥10 kg/m2 difference). Gene expression and genotyping data was gener   ated from 349 siblings using the Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0 and  Illumina Infinium Human 610K Quad platforms, respectively. RNA was  extracted from subcutaneous adipose tissue and DNA was extracted  from blood. Analysis was performed modelling genotyping signal inten   sity levels (LogR Ratio and B Allele Frequency) and gene expression  levels in a variance component framework. Results: We detected more than 10 genomic regions where signal intensity  was significantly associated with expression levels. For example, in a  region on chromosome 6 overlapping the MHC, we identified 34 mark   ers associated with transcript expression level at genome wide signifi   cance (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤10 7). As expected, these regions are listed in the Database  of Genomic Variants, i.e. they are CNVs. Conclusions: Using quantitative analysis of raw Illumina microarray data, we have  identified more than 10 genomic regions that are associated with ex   pression levels (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤10 7).

808,334,madelungÃ¢ÂÂs deformity in a girl with a novel GNAS  mutation,P02.114,,"MadelungÃ¢ÂÂs deformity is an uncommon congenital anomaly of the  wrist. It is characterized by a decreased carpal angle with a triangular  arrangement of the carpal bones, a shortened and curved radius, a  widened distal radioulnar joint and a posterior displacement of the ulna  head. The deformity is progressive and usually seen in adolescent  girls. Although some asymmetry can occur, the anomaly is typically  bilateral and symmetrical. The presumed cause is a partial early fusion  of the ulnar side of the radial epiphysis. Turner syndrome and Leri  Weill dyschondrosteosis are disorders most commonly associated  with MadelungÃ¢ÂÂs deformity. Here we present a 14 year old girl with a  MadelungÃ¢ÂÂs deformity, mild mental retardation, some dysmorphic fa   cial features and a relative short stature. She also has a brachydac   tyly type E, with brachymetacarpia and brachytelephalangy. Standard  chromosome analysis, array CGH and analysis of the SHOXab  gene  showed no abnormalities.

We present three unrelated patients with partially overlap   ping duplications in the 17q12 q21.32 region. Methods: Microarray analysis (Affymetrix SNP_6.0, BAC array, or oligo  array) was performed on purified DNA from peripheral lymphocytes.  FISH analysis was done on cultured lymphocytes according to stan   dard protocols. Results: We identified three unrelated patients with partially overlap   ping de novo  duplications in the 17q12 q21.32 region. All patients were  investigated with genome wide array platforms, showing sizes of the  duplications of 1.5 Mb, 6.6 Mb, and 7.7 Mb respectively.

825,461,Duplications 20p and 3q as a consequence of familial  complex chromosomal rearrangement,P03.037,,"Balanced complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) are extreme   ly rare. Their carriers have a high risk of primary infertility, spontane   ous abortions or children with unbalanced karyotypes. We report an  unusual case of a familial CCR involving three chromosomes. An 8 year old girl was referred for chromosome analysis because of  heart defect, dysmorphic facial features, mild mental retardation and  autistic features including a delay of speech development. Karyotyping  revealed derivative chromosomes 20 and 22. For further clarification of  the rearrangement, FISH was performed using 20p and 20q subtelo   meric probes. It showed that material from 20p was translocated onto  22p. Array CGH was essential for the identification of the suspected  third partner in this CCR: It showed a 3q duplication of about 16.5 Mb,  and the CCR thus involved chromosomes 3, 20 and 22. Karyotyping and FISH analysis of other relatives indicated that four  members of this family are carriers of a balanced form of this CCR.  These individuals are asymptomatic. Four of their descendants have  two types of unbalanced CCRs. The proband and her maternal aunt  have partial duplications of chromosome 3. Both have similar dysmor   phic facial features and mental retardation, but the aunt is lacking the  heart defect and autism. Two other individuals have partial duplica   tions of chromosome 20. These children are currently very young.  Their mental functioning seems to be normal, but the motor develop   ment is delayed and macrosomia is present in both cases.

827,489,t wo girls with mental retardation and behavioural  abnormalities: is the deletion of the A tXN1 gene on 6p22.3 a  major factor in causing the phenotype?,P03.065,,"6p22 interstitial deletions are relatively rare, with only eight patients  described so far. The clinical phenotype in these patients includes  developmental delay/mental retardation, defects of brain, heart and  kidney, craniofacial malformations and dysmorphic features. The com   mon deleted region, 2.2 Mb, harbouring 12 genes, has been defined  as critical for this syndrome. ATXN1 , located within this interval, has  been suggested as a candidate gene for the mental retardation based  on its expression in CNS and the cognitive impairments manifested in  knock out mice. We report on two patients carrying partly overlapping  de novo deletions within 6p22.3, which are smaller than the ones pre   viously reported. Patient 1 displays mild mental retardation and behav   ioural problems; her 115 kb deletion (chr6:16215803 16332297, hg19)  encompasses only GMPR  and ATXN1 . Patient 2 has severe mental  retardation, autistic features and hyperactivity. Her deletion spans 2.3  Mb (chr6:14545576 16846846, hg19) and includes JARID2 , DTNBP1   and MYLIP , in addition to GMPR  and ATXN1 . Because the GMP re   ductases encoded by GMPR and GMPR2  have redundant functions,  haploinsufficiency of GMPR  is not likely causing the cognitive impair   ments in our patients. We therefore suggest that ATXN1 hemizygosity  is sufficient to cause the mental retardation in patient 1. Furthermore,  additional genes such as MYLIP , which is expressed in brain and has  been shown to have a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, is expected  to contribute to the significantly more severe phenotype of patient 2.Cytogenetics11",2010.0,,"T.

850,884,Choosing GWAS subjects from risk populations,P08.21,,"Power, i.e., sample size is a crucial issue in genome wide association  studies (GWAS) on disorders generated by a multitude of weak genetic  effect sizes. Here, we examine the influence of sampling cases and/or  controls from populations that are subject to an external risk factor (such as smoking, nutritional or metabolic factors). We use an additive  threshold model and derive the necessary sample sizes as a function  of the external risk factorÃ¢ÂÂs strength and of the sampling scheme. If  both cases and controls are sampled from the risk population, a loss  of power must be expected. The loss of power (i.e., increase of neces   sary sample size) is even larger if only the cases are sampled from the  risk population, while the inverse scheme (non risk cases and risk con   trols) provides a gain of power since non risk cases are enriched for  disease favouring alleles while risk controls are enriched for protective  alleles. For small effect sizes we derive simple approximations in ana   lytically closed form. The principle of our analysis has some analogy  to the so called Carter effect, i.e. the phenomenon that the probability  in a child of a multifactorial disorder with sex dimorphism for liability  depends on the sex of the affected parent.

851,890,INTERSNP: Genome wide Interaction Analysis Guided by A Priori information,P08.27,,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have lead to the identifi   cation of hundreds of genomic regions associated with complex dis   eases. Nevertheless, a large fraction of their heritability remains un   explained. Interaction between genetic variants is one of several puta   tive explanations for the ``case of missing heritabilityÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ and, therefore,  a compelling next analysis step. However, genome wide interaction  analysis (GWIA) of all pairs of SNPs from a standard marker panel  is computationally unfeasible without massive parallelization. Further   more, GWIA of all SNP triples is utopian. In order to overcome these  computational constraints, we present a GWIA approach that selects  combinations of SNPs for interaction analysis based on a priori infor   mation. Sources of information are statistical evidence (single marker  association at a moderate level), genetic relevance (genomic location)  and biologic relevance (SNP function class and pathway information).  We introduce the software package INTERSNP that implements a lo   gistic regression framework as well as log linear models for joint analy   sis of multiple SNPs. Automatic handling of SNP annotation and path   ways from the KEGG database is provided. In addition, Monte Carlo  simulations to judge genome wide significance are implemented. We  introduce various meaningful GWIA strategies that can be conducted  using INTERSNP. Typical examples are, for instance, the analysis of all pairs of non  synonymous SNPs, or, the analysis of all combinations of three SNPs  that lie in a common pathway and that are among the top 50,000 sin   gle marker results. We demonstrate the feasibility of these and other  GWIA strategies by application to a GWAS data set and discuss prom   ising results.Statistical genetics, includes Mapping, linkage and association methods207",2010.0,,"C.

ASDs are etiologically heterogenous, and only 10% of the cases are  due to known medical conditions (chromosomal imbalances, genetic  disorders like Fragile X, Rett syndrome or Tuberous sclerosis). The emerge of new high resolution screening methods allows for de   tection of submicroscopic genomic aberrations. One of these methods;  microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) offers  the possibility of detecting copy number variations (CNVs, deletions or  duplications) associated with autism. We present the results of applying aCGH for identification of causal  CNVs in 50 children diagnosed with autism. Genomic DNA was ex   tracted from buccal cells and aCGH was performed using 44k and  105k human genome CGH oligo microarrays (Agilent Technologies  Inc.). Causal CNVs were identified in 9 (18%) of the patients. Two pa   tients had large aberrations (unbalanced translocation between chro   mosome 8 and chromosome 12, idic(15)). Five patients had smaller  CNVs in or close to genes previously associated with autism, and  two patients had CNVs not previously reported. Further analyses are  needed to determine the significance of these aberrations. Our data  demonstrates the utility of aCGH as a powerful diagnostic tool for de   tection of genomic imbalances in ASD.",2010.0,,"H. Sorte1, E. Sponheim2, K. Eiklid1, E. Gjevik2, O.

859,958,Association of a complex CNV region on 8p21.2 with  child and adult obesity in the French population,P09.032,,"Obesity is a growing public health concern exhibiting a high level of  heritability, much of which is unaccounted for. We have sought to in   vestigate the contribution of copy number variants (CNVs) to the ge   netic susceptibility to child and adult obesity. We have applied our novel CNV prediction algorithm cnvHap to Illu   mina GWAS data from child and adult obesity case control cohorts  from Northern France. CNVs were identified within a region on 8p21.2  encompassing a SNP showing marginal association with obesity in  the combined child and adult obesity dataset (p,5.68x10 4). Further  investigation of this CNV region (CNVR) revealed it to encompass two  variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and a 3,975bp deletion. The 3,975bp deletion and surrounding VNTRs were subsequently  genotyped using a combination of PCR and fragment analysis in the  Northern French child obesity cohort of 688 cases and 592 controls  and adult obesity cohort of 693 cases and 776 controls. This revealed  significant individual associations of both VNTRs and the deletion with  obesity (p<0.05). Since these variants are each only weakly signifi   cant, we consider it likely that the genotyped VNTRs and deletion are  tagging an as yet unidentified causal variant in this region. Detailed investigation of the 8p21.2 region has highlighted the complex  genomic architecture of many CNVRs, and emphasises the benefits of  the application of an approach combining bioinformatics and molecular  biology to CNV discovery and genotyping.",2010.0,,"J.

860,959,Systematic evaluation of the clinical significance of  inherited and de novo copy Number Variations in families with  Autism spectrum Disorders,P09.033,,"Array based studies have detected a wealth of copy number variations  (CNVs) in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Since some  CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini   cal significance of de novo  and inherited CNVs containing genes being  transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive   ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were  grouped into four categories. First, de novo  CNVs in families with both  parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from  a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely  to be causally related to ASD. The genes in these two categories par   ticipate in pathways probably associated with ASD, such as contactin  based cell communication ( CNTN5 , CNTN6 ), phosphoinositol signaling  (PIK3CA ), and regulation of neurotransmitter levels ( KCNMB4 , TPH2 ).  The de novo  CNVs found in patients with at least one parent scoring  higher than 1 SD above the mean on the SRS, and the CNVs inher   ited from an unaffected parent, while the other parent has an elevated  SRS score, are likely to exert a minor contribution to the phenotype.  Our analysis also indicates that in 6 out of 48 ASD patients two or more  genetic etiologies may be involved. This study extends the scope of  genome wide CNV profiling beyond de novo  CNVs in sporadic patients,  and may constitute a first step toward uncovering the missing heritability  in genome wide screening studies of complex psychiatric disorders .Complex traits and polygenic disorders22",2010.0,,"M.

The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities.

908,1432,Molecular genetic testing of mental retardation in  Bulgaria,P12.128,,"Mental retardation is highly heterogeneous in clinical and genetic point  of view. Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.

Noonan syndrome (NS) is genetically heterogeneous and mutations in  the PTPN11 , KRAS , SOS1 , RAF1 , BRAF , MEK1 , SHOC2  and NRAS   genes have been identified in up to 75% of cases. Here, we screened  a large cohort of PTPN11  and KRAS  mutation negative NS patients  for SOS1  mutations and found 6 distinct pathogenic SOS1  mutations  in 26 independent cases, and one rare unclassified variant. Seven  SOS1  mutations were novel. Among the new mutations identified, we  observed 5 missense mutations and one small in frame deletion. De   tailed clinical evaluation of SOS1  mutation positive subjects confirmed  the occurrence of a distinctive phenotype characterized by ectodermal  anomalies and congenital heart defects (CHDs), particularly pulmonic  valve stenosis and atrial septal defects, with lower prevalence of short  stature and cognitive impairment. Two individuals developed tumors.  One had mandibular giant cell granuloma (MGCG), while the other  had multiple tumors (MGCG, abdominal rhabdomyosarcoma, cerebral  glioma and granular cell tumors of the skin), providing further molecu   lar evidence of the linking of these tumors to the RAS MAPK signaling  pathway. Possible involvement of germline SOS1  mutations in isolated  CHD commonly encountered in individuals with SOS1  mutations ( i.e.,  atrial [23 patients] and ventricular [15 patients] septal defects, and pul   monic valve stenosis [21 patients]) was also explored.

Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disease char   acterized by congenital heart defects, short stature and characteristic  facial features. Mutations in PTPN11, RAF1, SOS1, KRAS, and NRAS  are responsible for 60 75% of the cases, thus additional genes, are ex   pected to be involved in Noonan syndrome pathogenesis. The geno   type/phenotype correlation has been hindered by the relatively few re   ported genotyped cases. Expanding the case numbers will benefit the  clinical community. A mutation analysis has been performed on RAF1,  SOS1 and on the SOS1 interacting GRB2, in twenty four NS patients  previously found to be negative for PTPN11 and KRAS mutations. We  identified four mutations in SOS1 and one in RAF1, while no GRB2  variants have been found. Interestingly the RAF1 mutation was pres   ent in a patient also carrying a newly identified p.R497Q familial SOS1  mutation, segregating with a typical NS SOS1 cutaneous phenotype.  The new SOS1 mutations have been predicted to dysregulate the pro   tein activity by bioinformatics. Functional analysis demonstrated the  R497Q SOS1 mutation leads to Jnk activation, but had no effect on  the Ras effector Erk1. We propose that this variant might contribute  to the onset of the peculiar ectodermal traits displayed by the proband  amidst the more classical NS presentation. The characteristic cutane   ous traits, frequently shown by NS patients carrying SOS1 mutations,  might be associated to the activation of both Jnk/Erk pathways. To our  knowledge, this is the first reported case of a NS patient harbouring  mutations in two NS genes, allowing us to propose a genotype/pheno   type correlation in the family.",2010.0,,"M.

The observations in the family also suggest  that such a SOX9 regulatory region duplication may predispose for  autism in the presence of a Y chromosome, i.e. a SRY gene.

Somatic mutations in these same genes have been described in various human cancers.We have developed methods to quantify several of these mutations in human sperm and have also identified FGFR3 and HRAS mutations in spermatocytic seminoma, a rare type of testicular tumour. The combined evidence suggests that these mutations, although occurring rarely, provide a selective growth advantage to the mutant spermatogonial cell, resulting in clonal expansion over time, accounting for the PAE. To date, all examples of these Ã¢ÂÂselfishÃ¢ÂÂ spermatogonial mutations  locate within a single signalling pathway, the growth factor receptor RAS pathway, which is a key determinant of spermatogonial stem cell proliferation and renewal. Our recent immunohistochemical analysis of normal testes shows features consistent with the occurrence of mutational microclones; a variety of patterns of antigen positivity are observed, consistent with different underlying driver mutations.Regulation of cell turnover is important in many disease contexts, for example neurogenesis and neoplasia, so the consequences of mutations that hijack this process within the testis are potentially far reaching. Depending on the spectrum of average PAE mutations levels, they may contribute significantly to the Ã¢ÂÂdark matterÃ¢ÂÂ in human heritability, currently speculated to be explained by uncommon alleles of moderate effect. Hence this mechanism is likely to be important in  the origins of common complex diseases such certain cancers and psychiatric disorders, as well as in congenital malformations.",2011.0,,"A. O. M.

927,42, Ankylosing s pondylitis,S10.2,,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory arthropathy affecting  primarily the spine and pelvis, with a disease prevalence of 0.4% in white Europeans. Susceptibility to AS is known to be highly heritable (h2>90%), and the major gene for the condition, HLA B27, has been known since 1972. However, only 1 5% of HLA B27 carriers develop  AS, and 10 20% of cases do not carry the gene, suggesting that other genes must be involved. Genetic studies of AS have made rapid progress over the past 5 years, with associations with novel genes 14 Concurrent Symposia 14 and genetic loci providing insights into the disease pathogenesis,  stimulating much follow up functional research and therapeutic development.In order to identify further genetic variants predisposing to AS, a gwas was performed involving 1782 British and Australian cases fulfilling  modified New York Criteria, and 5167 historical controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2). The study was combined with existing results from the Australo Anglo American AS Consortium (TASC) consortium, and replication of the most significant findings performed in 2109 cases and 4410 controls from Australia, Britain, and the Canadian SPARCC consortium. As well as confirming known associations at HLA, IL23R, ERAP1, KIF21B, 2p15  and 21q22,   we identified and subsequently replicated risk predisposing variants in RUNX3, IL12B, and LTBR, and found suggestive association at  ANTXR2, PTGER4, CARD9 , TRADD and TBKBP1 TBX21. Additionally, we identified a single SNP within the MHC, rs4349859,  which lies near the gene MICA and tags HLA B27 with near perfect sensitivity (98%) and specificity (99%). Studies in cases and controls carrying different HLA B27 subtypes, some AS associated and some not, indicate that rs4349859 is not itself AS causative, and further reduce the likelihood that an HLA B*27 linked gene is responsible for the association of B27 with AS. This SNP is far cheaper and easier to genotype than HLA B*27 itself, and can be used as an alternative to HLA B*27  typing, at least in European populations. In most common diseases the proposed genetic model involves interaction between loci, but to date no convincing examples of such interaction have been demonstrated. We identified an interaction  between HLA B*27 and variants within ERAP1 in the WTCCC2  (p,0.02), TASC (p,0.014) and replication datasets (p,0.0019). Specifically, risk variants in ERAP1 increased odds of disease in  HLA B*27  positive, but not HLA B*27 negative, cases (combined  P,7.3x10  6). In contrast, SNPs at other AS loci, including IL23R,  KIF21B, IL12B and the intergenic regions 2p15 and 21q22, were AS  associated in both HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27  ve disease. This  result indicates that HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27  ve forms of disease  have substantially different but overlapping aetiologies. Interestingly,  in a separate WTCCC2 study, we have demonstrated that ERAP1is associated with psoriasis, and that the association is restricted to cases carrying the HLA Class I protein HLA Cw6. The findings support mechanisms of association of HLA B*27  and ERAP1 with AS that  involve peptide presentation, and that ERAP1 contributes to disease risk through its action in trimming peptides prior to loading into nascent HLA class I molecules, rather than by cleaving pro inflammatory cytokine receptors on the cell membrane.Many further genes are likely to be identified over the coming years.  The International Genetics of Ankylosing Spondylitis Consortium will perform what will likely be the definitive SNP genotyping study of AS, involving over 12,000 cases and 20,000 healthy controls genotyped for 200,000 markers targeting immunogenetically relevant genes using the Ã¢ÂÂImmunochipÃ¢ÂÂ. This study will bring new findings including new genes, fine mapping of known genes, data about the value of genetic risk prediction in different world populations, and even pharmacogenetic data regarding TNF antagonist response and intolerance.These findings provide substantial material for the functional biology community to research, with the promise of early translation in both therapeutics and improved diagnostic tests.",2011.0,,"M.

934,99, m utations in RAD21 as a cause of a new cohesinopathy,C04.6,,"Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a dominantly inherited  multisystem developmental disorder that includes distinctive facial features, growth retardation, limb defects and variable cognitive delay. Mutations in NIPBL have been identified in approximately 75% of patients with severe classical CdLS but have been found in a far lower  percentage of patients with mild or atypical features. NIPBL is required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion through the loading of Cohesin, a multimer consisting of SMC1 and SMC3 and the clasp proteins, RAD21 and STAG. Following the identification of NIPBL,  mutations in SMC1A and SMC3 were detected in a small percent of patients. These patients have a milder phenotype without major structural anomalies, although all have significant mental retardation. By mutation screening of several genes encoding cohesins or associated proteins in a cohort of 180 mutation negative individuals, two de novo   RAD21  mutations in patients with features that diverge from classical  CdLS were identified. We have measured the expression and activity  of these missense mutations in protein interaction, DNA damage and zebrafish developmental assays. In short, one of these RAD21 mutations which increases binding to STAG2, appears to function in a dominant negative manner and results in a more severe phenotype than the other loss of function mutation, which alters binding to SMC1.Cohesinopathies comprise a broadening spectrum of pediatric developmental disorders. We will discuss the current understanding of mechanisms by which Cohesin mutations may alter transcriptional profiles to result in multiple variant developmental phenotypes and speculate on clinical features that appear to be unique and common between different Ã¢ÂÂdisorders of CohesinÃ¢ÂÂ.c05.1 Novel  m ethod to Estimate the Phenotypic Variation Explained by  Genome Wide Association  s tudies Reveals Large Fraction of the  m issing Heritability Z.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are conducted with the  promise to discover novel genetic variants associated with diverse traits. For most traits, associated markers individually explain just a modest fraction of the phenotypic variation, but their number can well be in the hundreds. We developed a maximum likelihood method  that allows us to infer the distribution of associated variants even when many of them were missed by chance. Compared to previous approaches, the novelty of our method is that it (a) does not require having an independent (unbiased) estimate of the effect sizes; (b) makes use of the complete distribution of P values while allowing for the false discovery rate; (c) takes into account allelic heterogeneity and the SNP pruning strategy. We then applied our method to the latest GWAS meta analysis results of the GIANT consortium. It revealed that while the explained variance of genome wide (GW)  significant SNPs is around 1% for waist hip ratio (WHR), the observed P values provide evidence for the existence of variants explaining 10% (CI,[8.5% 11.5%]) of the phenotypic variance in total. Similarly, the total explained variance likely to exists for height is estimated to be 29% (CI,[28% 30%]), three times higher than what the observed GW significant SNPs give rise to. This methodology also enables us to predict the benefit of future GWA studies that aim to reveal more associated genetic markers via increased sample size.",2011.0,,"F. J. Kaiser1, D. Braunholz1, J.

The PTPN11 gene is involved in 50% of Noonan syndrome  cases, but is also found to be mutated in 9% of fetuses with cystic  hygroma and increased nuchal translucency (NT) (Lee et al. (Clin Genet 2009;75:190)). In our laboratory parallel testing of PTPN11and KRAS in fetuses with a normal karyotype and an increased NT showed  a mutation frequency of 16% [Houweling et al.

In cultured umbilical cord derived cells it is clear that many SNPs form eQTLs dependent upon the cell type. The degree to which these loci are reproducibly associated with gene expression in primary  tissues and whether they act in a cell specific manner is unclear. We have sought to identify polymorphisms acting in a cell specific manner from physiologically relevant tissue   freshly purified positively selected lymphoid derived CD19+ B cells and myeloid derived CD14+ monocytes.Cells were purified from a cohort of 288 healthy adult Caucasians. Subjects were genotyped at 731,442 markers (Illumina HumanOmniExpress) and expression analysed using whole genome microarrays (Illumina HumanHT 12, n,566). At a p value <1x10 11  we identify 1960 SNPs with eQTLs unique to B cells and 3700 SNPs with eQTLs unique to monocytes. Whilst the most significant eQTLs tend to be shared between cell type, over 90% of SNPs with eQTLs at a p value <0.01 are cell specific. Furthermore, we identify a subset of ~20 genes with SNPs that lead to opposing directional effects on expression in a cell dependent manner. We confirm the microarray results for multiple genes using quantitative PCR and analyse several monocyte and B cell specific eQTLs in a third cell type   Natural Killer cells.

Our functional study in Danio rerio by the means of gene silencing, has demonstrated a role for five genes from the associated loci (ak3, arhgef3 , jmjd1c ,  rnf145 and tpma) in regulation of thrombopoiesis. Additionally, lineage  relatedness of megakaryocytes and erythrocytes prompted us to  explore the putative role of these genes in erythropoiesis. Morpholino (MO) knockdown of all five genes but tpma resulted in a variable  decrease in the number of erythrocytes. Arhgef3 depletion had the most profound effect on erythropoiesis, leading to further detailed studies. Examination of peripheral blood from arhgef3 MO injected embryos  revealed microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes, a classic feature of iron deficiency. Anaemia was rescued by intracellular supplementation  of iron to arhgef3 MO injected embryos, demonstrating that arhgef3   depleted erythroid cells, once provided with intracellular iron are fully capable of haemoglobinisation. Disruption of the arhgef3  target,  RhoA, also produced severe anaemia, which was again rescued by iron injection. Moreover, silencing of ARHGEF3 expression in the erythromyeloblastoid cell line K562 revealed that the uptake of iron transporter, transferrin, was severely impaired. This is the first study to provide evidence for ARHGEF3 being a regulator of transferrin and iron uptake in erythroid cells, through activation of RhoA.In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the value of pursuing GWAS signals as a new and exciting forward genetics approach in identifying novel regulatory molecules and signalling pathways in haematopoiesis.",2011.0,,"J.

Our experience in clinical genetics proved that childhood autism is a heterogeneous syndrome. The aim of our work was to analyze children with autism for mitochondrial DNA mutations and discuss the possibility of their treatment. We made clinical and laboratory investigations and sequenced mt DNA regions in peripheral blood by the PCR SBT method in 4 of our patients with autism.We found different mt DNA mutations and polymorphisms. In a girl suspected for Rett syndrome we found G6852A in mt CO1,which  changed Gly>Ser. In the 3 boys with autism we found the polymorphism T4216C (connected with predisposition to LHON or insulin resistance) in the first,the polymorphism G9055A (protective of Parkinson disease) in the second, and a polymorphism connected with predisposition to LHON in the third.

It has been demonstrated that de novo  missense mutations in the proto oncogene HRAS resulting in increased  activation of Ras MAPK pathway cause Costello syndrome. We present a group of five unrelated Polish patients with clinical diagnosis of CS. Mutation analysis of HRAS gene revealed heterozygous missense substitutions affecting aminoacid 12 of the protein product: c.34G>A (p.G12S) in two and c.35G>C (p.G12A) in three patients. Analysis of the available parental DNA confirmed four of the mutations as de  novo cases. The evaluated group represented relatively homogenous Costello phenotype with coarse facial features, feeding difficulties  and redundant skin with hyperpigmentation and deep plantar creases on hands and feet. Neonatal macrocephaly was present in all of the patients, as well as developmental delay, hypotonia and cardiac defects (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia or pulmonary stenosis). Interestingly, in one study case the coexistence of Turner and Costello syndrome was observed. Our results deliver the first important information on the molecular basis of Costello syndrome in Polish population. They indicate certain heterozygous missense mutations in HRAS to be responsible for CS cases worldwide and confirm that the molecular analysis of HRAS provide a reliable diagnostic test for Polish patients  diagnosed with Costello syndrome.

The inv dup (15) or idic (15) is the most common of the heterogeneous  group of the extra structurally abnormal chromosomes (ESAC). Two cytogenetics types have been identified. One is a metacentric or submetacentric and heterochromatic chromosome, not containing the Prader Willi Syndrome/ Angelman Syndrome Critical Region  (PWS/ASCR) [dic(15)(q11).dic(15)(q11)], can be familial or de novo  and most children show a normal phenotype. The second type has 15q euchromatin including PWS/ASCR [dic(15)(q12 or q13)], that frequently derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis. This condition is associated with an abnormal phenotype, which constitutes the idic(15) syndrome, and is nearly always sporadic.The inv dup (15) displays distinctive clinical findings represented by early central hypotonia and intellectual disability, epilepsy and autistic behaviour. Expressive language is absent or very poor and  often echolalic. Epilepsy with a wide variety of seizures, as a typical Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), can occur in these individuals.

He presents behavioral disorders as depression, impulsivity, hyperactivity and relationships difficulties with other children. EEG shows epilepsy. He uses short sentences but with pronunciations difficulties.  Developmental quotient was evaluated at 63 (Terman Merrill). Minor dysmorphic features were observed with upslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, mild retrognathia and protruding upper lip with long philtrum. Growth parameters at 7 years are in the normal range.CGH analysis showed a 2.015 Mb deletion distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. The deletion is maternally inherited. The family belongs to underprivileged socio cultural environment with relatives presenting learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities. Given this blurring familial situation, this deletion was initially considered as being  of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore polymorphic CNV were reported in this region.Two publications (Edelmann et al., 2007 ; J Med Genet 44:136 143 and Ramocki et al., 2010 ; Am J Hum Genet 87:857 865) reported  deletions or duplications distal to the Williams Beuren deletion.

1019,873, Genotyping KRAS and BRAF mutations in paraffin embedded cancer research samples,P06.116,,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is a complex  signalling cascade that is associated with the development and progression of many cancer conditions. It has been shown that approximately 35 45% of metastatic colorectal cancer tumors may have a KRAS or BRAF mutation, which makes them less likely to  respond to anti EGFR therapies. The identification of these mutations is therefore of great importance in clinical and pharmaceutical research. The Applied BiosystemsÃÂ® KRAS Mutation Analysis Reagents and BRAF Mutation Analysis Reagents were developed to facilitate research aimed at elucidating the role of these regulatory proteins in oncology. The reagents offer a simple protocol for the detection of 12 mutations in the KRAS gene and 3 mutations in the BRAF gene. In this collaborative research study, we made use of the Applied BiosystemsÃÂ® KRAS and BRAF Mutation Analysis Reagents  and the Applied Biosystems 3500 Dx, 3100 and 310 Genetic Analyzers to genotype known variants on 35 cancer research samples. The KRAS and BRAF Mutation Analysis Reagents results were easy to interpret and equivalent between the Applied BiosystemsÃÂ® 3100 and 310 Genetic Analyzers. The 3500 Dx instrument technology may also ease the analysis and create standardization for genetics laboratories, which will help alleviate the different quality of results that stem from varying technologies and chemistries.The Applied BiosystemsÃÂ® KRAS and BRAF Mutation Analysis Reagents are For Research Use Only.

Molecular diagnosis methods such as DNA  sequencing and conventional genotyping of tumor biopsies have advanced research in this field, but are limited in sensitivity due to stromal contamination and by genetic heterogeneity in cancer. We have developed competitive allele specific TaqMan ÃÂ® PCR (castPCR)  assays assays for detecting cancer associated sequence variations. CastPCR not only maintains the wide dynamic range, high sensitivity and reproducibility of TaqMan ÃÂ® assays but also greatly improves the  specificity. The technology enables detection, of as little as 1 mutant allele molecule in 10,000,000 wild type molecules. We report here sensitive and accurate detection of cancer associated KRAS mutations within formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) heterogeneous  cancer specimens. Eight FFPE model cell lines were initially used to validate the assays. Mutant FFPE cell line DNAs were titrated in the FFPE wild type cell line DNAs from 100% to 0.1%. Mutations were easily identified at the level of 0.1% with high reproducibility. 24 anonymous tumor tissues and 12 non tumor tissues from FFPE specimens were also examined. No positive samples were found in non tumor tissues. The results obtained by castPCR for the 24 tumor tissues were concordant to those previously reported by three different methods (Taqman ÃÂ® PCR, TaqmanÃÂ® PCR + PNA and Sequencing). Our  results demonstrate that castPCR as a new rare mutation detection  technology, has greater sensitivity, specificity and can thereby facilitate accurate molecular diagnosis of heterogeneous cancer specimens.",2011.0,,"R.

Although a few prevalent mutations have been identified with the sequencing of a single melanoma cell line, the full spectrum of somatic driver mutations remains unknown. We have performed exome sequencing to detect somatic mutations in protein  coding regions of seven melanoma cell lines (five unrelated and two derived from the same patient sampled 12 years apart) and their corresponding germline DNA. The number of coding non synonymous somatic mutations in the cell lines ranged from 158 to 709. The most abundant class of somatic mutations in all melanomas is C>T, a hallmark of exposure to UV light. In the two melanomas derived from the same patient two thirds of the somatic mutations were shared and showed signature of UV light; remaining mutations might have originated during the transition to the invasive phase. Six melanomas  had mutations in the BRAF gene around amino acid 600 and one had a mutation (Q61R) in the NRAS gene. In two melanomas we identified novel mutations in genes that are key regulators of the MAPK pathway. These mutations were also observed in two individuals in a larger sample collection.

Hearing is a complex trait but, until now, few genes are known to  contribute to its variability and little is known about genetic factors involved in age related hearing loss (ARHL). To discover genes and pathways underlying auditory function and ARHL we planned an integrated strategy characterized by three approaches. A) a GWAS  meta analyzing quantitative traits data from 6 isolated populations . Results led to the identification of eight suggestive significant loci (p<10 7) with a series of genes expressed within the inner ear. Additional biological candidates (p<10Ã¢ÂÂ6) were identified. Some of these new loci map to already known hereditary hearing loss loci whose genes still need to be identified. Data have also been used to construct a highly significant Ã¢ÂÂin silicoÃ¢ÂÂ pathway for hearing function characterized by a network of 49 genes, 34 of which are certainly expressed in the ear. B) a similar GWAS on qualitative traits from the same populations  leading to the identification of some loci on the following chromosomes 2,13,19,17,16,20 involving in some cases genes related with hearing development and hearing function but also genes whose function is still unknown. A replica phase is now in progress on a series of case/controls coming from different European countries. C) whole exome sequencing of cases selected from large pedigrees showing segregation of ARHL and coming from the same isolated populations. Preliminary results provide new insights into the molecular basis of hearing function and ARHL and may suggest new targets for hearing impairment treatment and prevention.",2011.0,,"G. Girotto1, N.

Aim of the study is the detection of new genetic pathways for potential diagnostic and  therapeutic targets in PCOS.PCOS phenotype definition was based on hormonal and metabolic variables in women in comparison to men. Our Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) focuses on genetic alterations of a special PCOS phenotype, regarding high testosterone levels in female and male LUdwigshafen RIsk and Cardiovascular (LURIC) patients.In total, 908.398 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were generated as GWAS raw data. Those SNPs have been analyzed following multiple steps and have been annotated with different criteria  for autosomal and X chromosome linked genes, separately, using WGAViewer Software. The significant associations between SNPs at 17 loci in LURIC female and 9 loci in the whole cohort with high levels of testosterone were identified.With the replication results of these candidate SNPs in our 669 carefully phenotyped PCOS and 410 control subjects, we expect to identify genetic variants contributing to diagnosis and new therapeutic aspects for PCOS prevention and treatment.",2011.0,,"U.

1040,1064, Next generation sequencing of known and putative susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders to detect rare high penetrant risk variants,P08.64,,"Schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are  complex neurodevelopmental disorders that share certain phenotypes including cognitive deficits and some behavioural characteristics. Such similarities suggest that these disorders may share an underlying pathology and thus may share some genetic risk variants. This study  involves next generation sequencing of the exonic regions of 215 potential susceptibility genes in an Irish sample of 150 cases of ASD, 300 cases of SZ and 300 controls, in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms, indels and structural variants contributing to one or both disorders. A multiplex target enrichment method is used whereby DNA samples are multiplexed together using DNA indexes/barcodes and enriched for the exonic regions of these genes using the Agilent SureSelect target enrichment method. This is followed by 80bp paired end sequencing in a single lane of an Illumina GAII. Gene selection  comprised of five categories: 1) Interactors of NRXN1, 2) Interactors of DISC1, 3) Genes within the Glutamate Receptor Complexes; NMDA, mGluR5 and AMPA, 4) Cell adhesion molecules and 5) Functional and Positional Candidates. Analysis of the pilot set of samples indicates that the approach undertaken is successful with an even spread of sequence information for 24 indexed samples per lane, >8X coverage for 84% of target regions and overall SNP concordance with previous GWAS data (Affymetrix 6.0) of 99.3%.

1049,1113, Association of the ciliary gene AHI1 with autism,P09.032,,"of Medical Genetics, Utrecht, Netherlands. Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an autosomaal recessive disorder  characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, the characteristic neuroradiologic Ã¢ÂÂmolar tooth sign,Ã¢ÂÂ and neurologic symptoms, including dysregulation of breathing and developmental delay. JBTS also includes variable features such as retinal dystrophy and renal  anomalies. Up to 27% of JBTS patients show features of autism. Thus far, 10 genes for JBTS have been identified. The ciliary gene AHI1  has been found mutated in 7 to 16% of cases with JBTS. On the other hand, of the 39 genes associated with autism, 29 (74%) encode ciliary genes. This association of ciliary genes with autism is highly significant (P < 0.001; two sided Fischer exact test). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ciliary genes may be involved in autism, by performing a candidate gene association study with a cohort of 84 patients with autism vs. 145 healthy controls for the 10 known JBTS genes (AHI1,  NPHP1, CEP290, ARL13B, RPGRIP1L, MKS3, CC2D2A, OFD1, TMEM216, and INPP5E). For AHI1 we found nominal association  with odds ratioÃ¢ÂÂs from 3.077 to 9.174 and p values for association < 0.0001 for SNPs rs12179084, rs2327587 and rs7766656.

Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an autosomaal recessive disorder  characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, the characteristic neuroradiologic Ã¢ÂÂmolar tooth sign,Ã¢ÂÂ and neurologic symptoms, including dysregulation of breathing and developmental delay. JBTS also includes variable features such as retinal dystrophy and renal  anomalies. Up to 27% of JBTS patients show features of autism. Thus far, 10 genes for JBTS have been identified. The ciliary gene AHI1  has been found mutated in 7 to 16% of cases with JBTS. On the other hand, of the 39 genes associated with autism, 29 (74%) encode ciliary genes. This association of ciliary genes with autism is highly significant (P < 0.001; two sided Fischer exact test). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ciliary genes may be involved in autism, by performing a candidate gene association study with a cohort of 84 patients with autism vs. 145 healthy controls for the 10 known JBTS genes (AHI1,  NPHP1, CEP290, ARL13B, RPGRIP1L, MKS3, CC2D2A, OFD1, TMEM216, and INPP5E). For AHI1 we found nominal association  with odds ratioÃ¢ÂÂs from 3.077 to 9.174 and p values for association < 0.0001 for SNPs rs12179084, rs2327587 and rs7766656.

Many rare Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that harbor  small genomic deletions and insertions have been described in the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To identify these likely functional elements, we combined three previously published large cohorts of autistic patients with a large number of controls to analyze over 25K unrelated individuals. After stringent quality control measures, we compared 3K cases to over 19K ethnically matched controls in a two stage genome wide association design. In all, we uncovered 275 statistically significant distinct copy number variable regions. The 60 genes nearest these robust CNVRs are most enriched in gene networks impacting neurological disease, behavior and developmental disorder. A more focused analysis of a subset of 87 CNVRs that are predicted to disrupt 26 genes highlights GABA receptor signaling, and methionine/glutathione trans sulfuration as the most significant canonical pathways disrupted in ASD. Furthermore, we used available family members to characterize CNVRs into inherited vs de novo and used ethnicity information to characterize their effects in different ethnic populations. Taken together, the CNVRs we have identified impact multiple novel genes and signaling pathways, including genes involved in GABA receptor signaling, that may be important for new  personalized therapeutic development.",2011.0,,"D.

We describe a family where brother and sister show mild intellectual disability, behavior abnormalities and epilepsy, with normal brain imaging and no major dysmorphic features. Karyotype is normal, as well FMR1 analysis in the male patient. Their mother, who died of cancer at 48 years of age, and a maternal aunt are both reported  to have behavioral abnormalities, mild intellectual disability, but no seizures. Two maternal uncles are healthy.In both patients, array CGH analysis revealed a 250 kb deletion of chromosome 7q31.32 encompassing one single gene, CADPS2. The father does not carry the deletion, indicating likely maternal inheritance. The deletion was excluded in one of the maternal uncles.CADPS2 is a calcium binding protein that regulates the exocytosis of synaptic and dense core vesicles in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. CADPS2 is a candidate gene for autistic disorders, since it maps in the  autism susceptibility region AUTS1 on chromosome 7q31.32, which alsocorresponds to a candidate region for mood disorders. Knock out mice show an autistic like phenotype and some ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) patients show a possible defect in CADPS2 splicing. We performed, therefore, a mutation screening in 46 individuals with ASD and in 34 patients with intellectual disability who did not carry any genomic rearrangement as far as array CGH analysis could detect. Two novel variants were identified in two unrelated ASD individuals, in exon 6 and exon 13 respectively. None of these changes was detected in 140 healthy individuals and functional analysis of these variants is currently ongoing. Detailed results will be presented.",2011.0,,"G. Tortora1, C.

It is known that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8explains approximately 30% of CD heritability.

These 39 non HLA loci comprise113 genes that could potentially also contain rare variants contributing to CD. GWAS arrays preclude the identification of these rare variants. In this study, high throughput exome sequencing was used to investigate significant enrichment of novel and rare coding variants in CD cases versus controls.Genomic DNA of15 unrelated individuals with CD was enriched for the ~30Mb of coding DNA with NimbleGen 2.1M Human Exome Arrays and sequenced using Illumina technology. Sequence variants (SV)  with a quality score above 20 were annotated with our custom pipeline. On average, 91% of the exome was covered at least ten fold and on average18.468genetic variants were identified per individual. To find rare and novel variants in the regions of interest our analysis was restricted to the 113 genes from the 39 CD loci. After removing common SV (>5%) based on HapMap and the 1000 Genome project and all SV present within non coding regions, we are left with 20 potential variants.

In recent years there has been increased focus on the fact that neuroinflammation may underlie many neurodegenerative disorders such as AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease and ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease. Furthermore, the predisposition of certain  families to neuroinflammatory disorders such as Viliuisk encephalitis, RasmussenÃ¢ÂÂs encephalitis and multiple sclerosis, highlights the potential of genetic predisposition to neuroinflammation.We have recently identified a unique breed associated encephalitis in young greyhounds. Although the underlying cause is unknown, the early onset and high frequency of disease in siblings makes a genetic predisposition likely. This disorder is invariably fatal and the unique pattern of distribution of inflammation within brain tissue made it possible to accurately phenotype this condition and allowed for the  collection of diseased siblings, healthy siblings, parents and unrelated control tissues.In preliminary studies, Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Dog Leukocyte Antigen (DLA) three locus class II haplotypes were determined in 39 diseased dogs with post mortem confirmed disease, and 111 unrelated healthy controls. A significant association was detected between the DLA DRB1*01802/DQA1*00101/DQB1*00802 haplotype and the development of disease, observed in 38.5% cases in contrast to 11.7% controls (OR,4.7, Chi2,11.9, p<0.0006).A genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 25 unrelated diseased animals and 24 unrelated controls. No regions achieved genome wide significance but results from a larger cohort are pending. The absence of a strong association in the GWAS study suggests this disease is not monogenic.

1077,1224, Variants associated with mammographic density are also associated with breast cancer,P09.144,,"introduction: Mammographic density (MD), is one of the strongest  breast cancer risk factors. However, the mechanism by which this  risk is mediated is unclear. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that a variant in ZNF365 is associated with both breast cancer risk and MD 1;2. We investigated if other SNPs  showing evidence for association with MD in the meta GWAS were associated, in aggregate, with breast cancer risk. m ethod: The SNPs associated with MD were identified through meta  analysis of 5 GWAS(n,4877). For each SNP, Z statistic for combined  effect over all studies was computed and converted into per allele effect size estimate (ÃÂ² k ). Effect of each SNP on breast cancer risk  was then assessed using data from UK2 GWAS study (3628/5190).  The combined effect of multiple SNPs was evaluated by multiplying signed MD beta value(ÃÂ² k) for each of N SNPs over given significance  threshold in MD meta GWAS by their number of effect alleles at that SNP, G ik(0, 1 or 2), and summing over all N SNPs to create the  individualÃ¢ÂÂs score(Zi). N Zi,Ã¢ÂÂ ÃÂ²k Gik k,1 Logistic regression was then used to examine if the individualÃ¢ÂÂs score was predictive of breast case control status. Results: The top 5% of density SNPs significantly predicted breast  cancer case control status in the UK2 GWAS(P,0.005 & P,0.009 genotyped & imputed SNPs respectively). This predictive effect was  not seen when only top 1% of density SNPs were used(P,0.3 & P,0.5 using genotyped & imputed SNPs respectively). c onclusions: These results suggest that many SNPs associated with  MD are also associated with breast cancer.Complex traits and polygenic disorders302",2011.0,,J.

1082,1253, i nvestigation of genome wide association signals for obesity: synthetic association and haplotype analyses at the melanocortin 4 receptor gene locus,P09.173,,"Background: Independent genome wide association studies (GWAS)  showed an obesogenic effect of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) more than 150 kb downstream of the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R). The SNPs might directly influence MC4R function/expression, or they are on a haplotype that predisposes to obesity or  includes functionally relevant genetic variation (synthetic association). MC4R is an ideal model to explore synthetic association.Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed a genomic region (364.9 kb) encompassing the MC4R in GWAS data of 424 obesity trios (extremely obese child/adolescent and both parents). SNP rs12970134 showed the lowest p value (p , 0.004); conditional analyses on this SNP revealed that 7 of 78 analyzed SNPs provided independent signals. These 8 SNPs were used to derive two marker haplotypes. The confirmed (363 independent obesity trios) obesity effect haplotype  comprises the MC4R. Including MC4R coding variants in a joint model had almost no impact on the effect size estimators expected under synthetic association. Haplotype analyses were also conducted for the 31 additional GWAS derived SNPs; 2 haplotypes revealed better results than the single SNPs, confirmation is ongoing.Conclusions/Significance: A haplotype reaching from 5Ã¢ÂÂ of the MC4R to at least 150 kb from the 3Ã¢ÂÂ end of the gene showed a stronger association to obesity than single SNPs. Synthetic association analyses revealed that MC4R coding variants had almost no impact on the association signal.

1090,1282, Imaging Genetics: tool for gene finding and characterization in psychiatric disorders,P09.202,,"Alteration of regional brain structure is an inherent feature of  neuropsychiatric disorders, but it remains unclear if this is causally related to pathogenesis. If this were the case, alterations of brain structure should also be present in healthy individuals carrying genetic risk factors for such disorders. This, in turn, would imply that brain  structure in the healthy population can be used as an intermediate phenotype for gene finding in neuropsychiatric disorders.We enrolled >1700 young healthy adults in the Brain Imaging Genetics (BIG) study. Structural MRI brain images are available from scans at 1.5 or 3 Tesla. FSL FIRST is used to assess volumes of specific brain structures. Genotyping of several candidate genes and genome wide genotyping (Affymetrix 6.0, n,1000) was performed.Hypothesis driven testing of candidates for neuropsychiatric disorders lead (among others) to the following findings: By gene wide (set  based) testing of the AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD) gene SORL1 we found a significant association with hippocampus volume, one of the first structure affected by AD, in a discovery sample of 446 BIG participants (p,0.0432) and replication in 490 additional subjects (p,0.0093).Preliminary GWAS of amygdala volume in 600 samples resulted in association findings for several suspected psychiatric risk genes, such as CDH13, featuring among the GWAS top findings for ADHD, addiction and schizophrenia.In conclusion, risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders indeed affect brain structure in healthy individuals suggesting that altered brain structure is cause rather  than consequence of disease.

The disorder affects up to 1% of the population and the genetic contribution is estimated to be around 80%. Thus far, genome wide association studies of schizophrenia have had limited success,  with the best finding at the HLA locus at chromosome 6p. While only a very small number of loci yield genome wide significance for association, the vast majority of the genetic contribution to disease susceptibility remains uncovered. It is likely to be overrepresented in non significant top SNPs of large scale GWAS results. In order to uncover potential interesting candidates, we selected the top 6,000 SNPs with significance threshold at p<0.001 from the international PGC meta analysis consisting of some 9,000 cases and 12,000 controls and examined their possible involvement in schizophrenia  using gene expression data from whole blood.

The transcripts significantly regulated by the top SNPs from were subsequently tested for differential expression in an independent set of schizophrenia cases and controls (n,200). The eQTL analysis yielded significant cis acting effects, whereas no trans effects were observed.

Four GWAS cohorts, comprising 2,296 SSc patients and 5,171 healthy controls, were meta analyzed looking for associations in the selected subgroups. Eighteen polymorphisms were further tested in nine independent cohorts comprising an additional 3,175 SSc patients and 4,971 controls. Conditional analysis for associated SNPs in the HLA region was performed to explore their independent association in antibody subgroups. Overall analysis showed non HLA polymorphisms rs11642873 in IRF8 gene (P , 2.32x10 12, OR , 0.75) and rs12540874 in GRB10 gene (P , 1.27x10 6, OR , 1.15) to be  associated with lcSSc and rs11047102 in SOX5 gene (P , 1.39x10 7, OR , 1.36) with ACA positive patients. In the HLA region, we observed highly associated allelic combinations in the HLA DQB1 locus with ACA (P , 1.79x10 61, OR , 2.48), in the HLA DPA1/B1 loci with ATA (P , 4.57x10 76, OR , 8.84) and in NOTCH4 with ACA P , 8.84x10 21, OR , 0.55) and ATA (P , 1.14x10 8, OR , 0.54).

Consequently, comparing different studies is difficult, and it is impossible to examine a full and unbiased picture of all the data that exist. To address this deficit, GWAS Central (www.gwascentral.org) (previously HGVbaseG2P) was constructed   representing a free and open access resource for the interrogation of summary level GWAS data, ultimately combining the features of a database and a scientific journal.GWAS Central employs powerful graphical and text based data presentation methods for discovery, visualisation and co examination of many studies, at genome wide and region specific levels. Studies of interest can be identified using chromosomal regions/genes and  markers. There is also the facility for researchers to securely view their own uploaded datasets alongside many published studies.Current content includes top p values from collections; supplementary data; direct researcher submissions; and publicly available data. Consequently, the database now hosts >21 million p values and 708 studies (vs 3,948 p values and 798 studies in the NHGRI GWAS catalog), representing an estimated ~5% of all such data yet produced.A version of GWAS Central will soon be released for research groups to install on their own servers allowing them to manage, analyse and control access to their own data. These installations will be interoperable and searchable as a federated network.This research received funding from the European CommunityÃ¢ÂÂs Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007 2013) under grant  agreement number 200754, GEN2PHEN.",2011.0,,"R.

1115,1458,The transcription factor MEIS1 marks a megakaryocyte specific alternative promoter of the DN m 3 locus at the position of a GWA s sequence variant for platelet volume,P11.050,,"We recently identified 12 quantitative trait loci for mean platelet volume  and three for platelets count by a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). One of the association single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10914144, lies in intron 2 of the DNM3 gene on chromosome 1q24.3. We set out to elucidate the mechanism by which sequence variation in the DNM3 locus exerts its effect on platelet volume.First we reproduced the GWAS association in platelets from two groups of 19 healthy individuals each, who were homozygous for the major and minor alleles of the association SNP (P<0.05, unpaired t test). We then measured DNM3 transcript abundance and observed significant differences between the groups. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massive parallel sequencing for the MK specific transcription factor MEIS1 in the MK like cell line CHRF  288 11 identified four MEIS1 binding sites within the DNM3 locus. One site in intron 2 of DNM3 harbours a SNP (rs2038479) 10,600 bp downstream of the original association SNP, with which it is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2,0.941). Sequencing of MK mRNA and 5Ã¢ÂÂ RACE identified a novel, alternative DNM3 transcript that lacks the first two exons and instead contains a novel exon, named 2B, which is located in intron 2. Real time qPCR analysis demonstrated that in MKs transcript 2B is predominant whilst being virtually absent from neuronal cells. Promoter studies identified an alternative promoter upstream of exon 2B which is only active in MKs but not in neuronal cells. Studies are currently underway to assess DNM3 protein function in megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation.",2011.0,,S.

We quantified 3 differentially methylated regions in GNAS: NESP (2 regions of 13 and 20 CpGs), XL (24 CpGs) and exon A/B (20 CpGs) methylation via the Sequenom EpiTYPER in 3 PPHP patients with variable degree of AHO (shortness, brachydactyly, behavior problems, round face) but no GNAS coding mutation. These patients showed significant hypermethylation of preferential CpGs in NESP and XL (Z test, p<0,05) and one patient also had significant A/B hypermethylation. This is a novel imprint pattern that has not been described since PHPIb/PHPIa epidefects are characterized by A/B and XL hypomethylation and NESP hypermethylation. Further studies are needed to unravel this novel methylation pattern in relation to an AHO phenotype by including more patients.",2011.0,,"B. Izzi1, K. Devriendt2, D. Lambrechts3, C. Van Geet1,4, K.

1127,1536,Distal gene regulatory elements have an average size of a nucleosome,P11.130,,"Nucleosomes consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around eight histone  proteins, with a normal distance of 20 30 bp between the nucleosome ends. Transcription factors (TFs) bind to promoters and distal regulatory elements and regulate the activity of nearby genes. Promoters located upstream of genes are well known but distal regulatory elements are  poorly defined as to location and size. Using 200 million aligned reads from MNase I digested HepG2 chromatin, we created genome wide nucleosome profiles. These were correlated to ChIP seq results for the TFs HNF4a and FOXA2, which bind to distal regulatory elements. The patterns suggest that one nucleosome is displaced at the regulatory elements. Footprints of nucleosomes around public ENCODE data of DNase I hypersensitivity sites at distal locations also suggests that in general, a single nucleosome is removed by the TF complexes.To apply the strategy to a gene of medical interest, we studied SNPs  identified in GWAS studies for dose requirement of the drug warfarin, which is commonly used to prevent thrombosis. These studies have identified several SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium in and around the VKORC1 gene, but the functional one has not been identified. We  used several chromatin signals and FAIRE DNA as a measure of open chromatin to prioritize among VKORC1 SNPs and found that most of them are located in chromatin without regulatory potential. Out of 22 tested VKORC1 SNPs, 7 are located in nucleosome free regions as  determined by MNase seq and qPCR of FAIRE DNA, which indicates that they may be functional.",2011.0,,"O. Wallerman, M.

1132,1579, t hree novel mutations in t urkish patients with Alstrom s yndrome,P12.007,,"AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome (AS) is a rare multisystemic disorder. Major clinical symptoms of the disease are congenital retinal dystrophy leading to blindness, neurosensorial hearing lost, childhood obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutant form of ALMS1 gene causes AS. ALMS1 is a novel gene which is comprised  of 23 exons encoding a protein of 4169 amino acids that does not  share significant sequence homology with any other known genes. The ALMS1 protein is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies of ciliated cells, perhaps playing an important role in cilia function and intraflagellar transport. RNA interference knockdown experiments indicate that a total lack of ALMS1 impairs cilia formation. To date, more than 100 mutations, mostly nonsense and frameshift type, in ALMS1 have been reported in AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome. The reported mutations are primarily clustered in exons 16, 10, and 8, but less  common mutations also occur in exons 12, 18 and 11. In present study, four Turkish AS patients were analysed. Mutation screening of the whole coding region and all intron/exon boundaries were performed by PCR and direct sequencing. As a result of sequence analysis, three novel mutations; c.4155insA; T1386NfsX15, c.5311C>T; p.Q1771X, c.9749C>A; p.S3250X and several polymorphism; IVS4+20T>A, F731F, V673G, D2674H, R4031K, IVS18 12T>C were detected in patients.

Male patients all had severe mental retardation and behavior problems. Dysmorphic features included long narrow face, malar hypoplasia, large forehead, full nasal root, thin nose, small philtrum. Head circumference was normal. They had no marfanoid habitus or visceral malformations. Brain MRI, in two patients, showed isolated moderate cerebral atrophy. Most affected females were moderately mentally affected but one of them had severe MR with autistic features. The initial linkage study revealed a localization region from Xp11.21 (AlaS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5) in 6 of 7 affected males.

Heterozygous gain of function mutations in various genes encoding proteins of the Ras MAPK signaling pathway have been identified as the genetic basis of NS.  Although NS is relatively commonly inherited disorder (1:1000 1:2500 live births), it has been molecularly characterized in only a small proportion of human populations throughout the world and there are no reports on the genetic background of Slavic patients with NS. Here we report the results of molecular and clinical analysis in a cohort of 59 patients affected by NS. Mutation analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1 and KRAS genes confirmed NS in 56 patients, including 40 probands and 16 affected relatives, with a total mutation detection rate of 67.8%. We identified missense mutations in PTPN11 for 28, SOS1 for 10  and RAF1 for 2 unrelated patients. All of the changes were already known, except for two novel substitutions in SOS1 and one in RAF1 gene. The correlation between genotype and phenotype is similar to that observed in other studies. Patients with SOS1 mutations showed higher frequency of macrocephaly, ptosis, webbed neck, mitral valve anomaly, renal and ectodermal abnormalities in comparison to the group with mutations in PTPN11. This study demonstrated that only three most common genes related to Ras MAPK pathway (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1) are involved in the pathogenesis of Polish NS patients.

1174,86, Modelling neurogenesis impairment in Down syndrome using induced pluripotent stem cells from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21,C04.6,,"Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy 21, is the most common chromo somal disorder, with an incidence of 1 in 800 live births. Its phenotypic cha racteristics include intellectual impairment and several other developmen tal abnormalities, for the majority of which the pathogenetic mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report the generation and the characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21: Twin N iPSCs for the normal and Twin DS iPSCs for the DS affected iPSCs. We hypothesize that these samples were ideal to study the effect of the supernumerary chromosome 21, since the rest of the genome is identical between the two samples. Karyotype and high resolution array based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, confir   med the chromosomal constitution of these iPSCs. Transcriptome analysis by mRNA Seq showed alterations in the expression of genes that impact on DS features. In vivo differentiation of Twin DS iPSCs revealed an abnor  mal teratoma formation in NOD SCID mice. In vitro, Twin DS iPSC derived neurospheres showed a reduced number of neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs). When NPCs were further induced to mature into neurons, we found struc tural changes in the architecture and density of neural populations together with alterations in the expression of genes involved in lineage specification in neurogenesis and brain development. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that the increased expression and activity of the dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A protein underlie these defects. In conclusion, these findings establish these iPSCs as a unique cellu   lar model to study the detailed mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DS and design new therapies.ESHG Concurrent Sessions  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org22 www.eshg.orgC05.1 RNAi based functional profiling of loci from blood lipid genome wide  association studies H.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful tools to unravel  genomic loci associated with common traits and complex human disease.  However, GWAS only rarely reveal information on the exact genetic elements  and pathogenic events underlying an association. In order to extract functio nal information from genomic data, strategies for systematic follow up stu  dies on a phenotypic level are required. Here we address these limitations  by applying RNAi to analyze >100 candidate genes within 55 loci identified by GWAS as associated with blood lipid levels, coronary artery disease and/or myocardial infarction for a function in regulating cholesterol levels in  cells. The genes were knocked down with siRNAs and the consequences on  cellular free cholesterol (FC) and the efficiency of LDL internalization into cells were quantified using automated microscopy and multiparametric  image analysis. We will show evidence that loss of function of a surprisingly  high number of the trait associated genes affected LDL uptake, FC, or both. For several genes without previously known lipid regulatory roles the func  tional effects upon gene knockdown closely correlated with altered LDL  receptor levels. By providing strong evidence for disease relevant functions of lipid trait associated genes our study demonstrates that quantitative, cell based RNAi is a scalable strategy for a systematic, unbiased detection of  functional effectors within GWAS loci.",2012.0,,"Y.

1176,88, Estimating the fraction of established metabolic trait loci with discernible pleiotropic effects,C05.4,,"Genetic variation influences human quantitative trait levels and risk of me tabolic disease. The patterns of trait association observed in genome wide association studies (GWAS) at individual cardio metabolic risk loci are high ly variable and allelic heterogeneity is often observed for association within and between traits.The Cross Consortia Pleiotropy Group was formed to investigate the pat   terns of multi trait associations across the genome for cardio metabolic traits. We aimed to estimate the fraction of established GWAS loci associated with more than one cardio metabolic trait showing strong (r2>0.8), mode   rate (r2>0.2) linkage disequilibrium (LD) or evidence of allelic heterogenei   ty between associated variants.We evaluated 271 SNPs representing associations from published GWAS meta analyses (Nov.2010) in Europeans of 20 quantitative and two disea   se phenotypes from six cardio metabolic trait consortia. We identified 106 regions associated with multiple traits, defined as sets of adjacent variants located less than 500kb apart. We used LD estimated from 1000 Genomes CEU data.Across the 106 regions defined by SNPs of interest, we observed 49 (30%) containing the same SNP associated with more than one trait. Of these, 37 contain SNPs associated with highly correlated traits, e.g. lipids and obesity. Of the remaining regions, 38 (23%) contain variants in strong LD and 30 (19%) contain variants in moderate LD, and 46 (28%) regions contain vari ants in only modest LD (r2<0.2).Our results highlight that a substantial proportion of metabolic trait loci in corporate complex patterns of multi trait allelic heterogeneity, suggesting that statistical approaches that model epidemiological correlations between phenotypes may increase power and resolution of gene mapping efforts.ESHG Concurrent Sessionswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201223 www.eshg.orgC05.5 Dysfunctional NO signaling due to a double mutation in GUCY1A3  and CCT7 identified by whole exome sequencing increases risk for  myocardial infarction J.

Myocardial infarction is a life threatening disease, which results from sud den atherothrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Most cases of MI occur  sporadically but in rare cases the disease accumulates in families. Here we  show by using exome sequencing in such family the identification of hetero zygous mutations (p.Leu163Phefs*24 and p.Ser525Leu) in two functional   ly related genes, GUCY1A3 and CCT7, in 7 and 11 out of 15 affected family members, respectively. Single locus linkage analysis revealed no significant LOD score, however two locus linkage analysis considering both mutations revealed a significant maximum LOD score of 5.68. Moreover, a GWAS of 28K  MI or CAD cases and 75K controls identified a signal across the GUCY1A3  locus (P<1.74x10 8 for rs7692387). While GUCY1A3 encodes the alpha1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), CCT7 a member of the chapero  nin containing TCP1 complex (TRiC/CCT), which, among other functions,  stabilizes sGC. This enzyme generates cGMP upon stimulation with nitric oxide (NO) and thereby pacifies platelets among other functions. We sub  sequently demonstrated that in vitro sGC activity is severely impaired by  the GUCY1A3 and CCT7 mutations. Platelets from double mutation carriers  contained less sGC protein and consequently a reduced NO induced cGMP  formation. Moreover, in mice deficient for the alpha1 sGC protein subunit thrombus formation in the microcirculation in vivo upon local trauma was  accelerated. In conjunction, we linked mutations in GUCY1A3 and CCT7;  encoding two functionally related proteins, to MI, associated a common va riant in one of the genes to the same disease, and propose defective sGC dependent NO signaling as a mechanism leading to MI.",2012.0,,"L.

Microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) has pro vides a relatively quick method to scan the genome for gains and loses of chromosomal material. This new methodologies have led to identification of novel genomic disorder in patients with developmental delay/mental retardation and/or multiple congenital anomalies (DD/MR/MCA), with a significant increase in diagnostic yield .In this study we present the result of array CGH obtained in 150 children with normal karyotype but DD/MR/MCA. The array CGH 60K from agilent platform was performed.In 34 patients (22,66%) was detected a chromosomal deletion or duplicati   on previously described like pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs),. In 15 cases (10%) was necessary the analysis of parental samples, showing that 6 anomalies (40%) had occurred de novo and was classified as pathogenic and in 9 cases (60%) appeared to be inherited from an unaffected parent. In a total of 40 patients (26,66%) was possible to detect a pathogenic CNVs .Recent studies suggest that when aCGH is performed with an apparently normal karyotype, the diagnostic yield increases by an additional 8 17%. In our study we have obtained a 26,66% of children with pathogenic CNVs that is higher than the results obtained by other authors. This increase at the detection rate probably is due to the array type utilized.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201257 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters As a conclusion, array CGH can be implemented routinely after a normal  chromosome result when a phenotype of DD/MR/MCA is present, but is  also appropriate for patients with autism and apparently balanced trans  locations.",2012.0,,"M.

The well known underlying molecular mechanism of this condition, also referred to as FRAXE, is a (CCG)n trinu cleotide repeat expansion which leads to silencing of the FMR2 gene. Addi   tionally, deletions within the FMR2 gene were described in handful number individuals with ID.Here we report on a de novo 131 kb deletion of FMR2 gene in a 2 years old boy with a mild developmental delay, behaviour changes, hypotonia, and discrete facial dysmorphism. The deletion, detected by SNP array ana   lysis (Affymetrix 250 K Nsp I), spans between the base pairs 147454718 147586323 (NCBI36). The aberration and its de novo origin were confirmed by MLPA. RNA analysis on the patient showed a 994 bp deletion of AFF2 transcript, resulting in the complete loss of exons 2 and 3.In conclusion, this case report further confirms the role of FMR2 gene dele tions as a FRAXE phenotype underlying mechanism.

On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis. Three novel (p.Asp331Thrfs*11,  p.Thr321Glnfs*23, p.Glu242*) and two known germline mutations  (p.Pro246Leu, p.Arg130*) have been found in 8 of the 53 probands (15%). We discuss possible genotype/phenotype correlation in our group of pati   ents. Our data support former findings that PTEN mutations are frequent  in patients with ASDs and macrocephaly. Therefore PTEN testing should  be considered in such patients. The findings may impact the assessment of  the recurrence risk and medical management of the families including early cancer prevention.

1241,470,Chromosome kissing in association with the ATR X syndrome,P03.036,,"ATR X (X linked ÃÂ± thalassemia / mental retardation) syndrome is one of the syndromes associated with abnormal epigenetic gene regulation, which  appears males with X linked mental retardation, HbH disease, skeletal ab   normalities, and autistic behavior. ATR X syndrome is caused by a mutation  in the ATRX gene localized on the X chromosome (Xq21.1), which encodes  ATRX protein, one of the chromatin remodeling proteins. However, the  details of molecular mechanism with symptoms of this syndrome are still unknown. Here to learn more about the relationships between nuclear ar chitecture and failure of epigenetic regulation in the ATR X syndrome, we ex   amined characteristics of spatial positioning of following three chromosome arm specific regions by 3D FISH technique; 1) Xq (ATRX gene has mapped on), 2) 16p (HBA has mapped on), and 3) 11p (HBB has mapped on). After  image acquisition by confocal laser scaning microscope, analysis of relative  spatial positioning of three painted regions was performed. The results sho   wed that neighborhood association of particular two chromosome territory  regions called as chromosome kissing was observed with high frequency  between Xq and 16p and between 11p and 16p in cell nuclei from the ATR X syndrome patients, respectively. The frequency of the same combination from the normal individual is approximately halves of them, respectively.  Thus we considered that the spatial arrangement of nuclear architecture  has been affected after one has been attacked with the ATR X syndrome.",2012.0,,"H. Tanabe1, T .

1281,811, Molecular genetic testing in patients with Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma,P06.165,,", Ostrava, Czech Republic, 2Faculty of Medicine, University of  Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic. Introduction:  Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most  serious cancers. For targeted biological treatment, sensitive and specific identification of genetic changes is necessary. Identification of genetic chan ges (mutations) within EGFR, KRAS and ALK oncogenes, associated with NS CLC, allows choosing the patients, which benefit from biological therapy.Material and Methods: DNA is isolated from biopsy and cytology speci   mens with verified histological diagnosis. Mutation detection is performed by real time PCR, fragment analysis, primer extension analysis and mutant enriched PCR. Wt EGFR patients (e.g. with no mutation detected) are tested for ALK gene rearrangement, causing the EML4 ALK fusion gene formation. Analyses are performed on histological slides using the FISH method.Results: Since 10/2010 till 12/2011, 199 DNA samples were analyzed. Out of these, 12 patients (6 %) were found to be positive for activating mutations within EGFR gene. Since 07/2011 till 12/2011, 54 patients were analyzed  for ALK gene rearrangement. This change has been proven in 2 cases. Discussion: Activating mutations of the EGFR gene correlate with therapeu  tic response to tyrosin kinase inhibitors. Frequency of mutations within the EGFR gene is 5   20 %. ALK gene rearrangement can predict therapeutic re  sponse for ALK inhibitors. These rearrangements are found approximately  in 5 % of NSCLC patients. Our results correlate with abovementioned fin dings . Occurrence of certain mutations, e.g. T790M, as well as KRAS gene  mutations and ALK gene rearrangements predicts resistance to TKIs the  rapy. Conclusions: Determination of tumor mutational status can provide power   ful tool for setting up strategy and therapeutic protocols in NSCLC patients.",2012.0,,"D. Konvalinka1, J.

1285,896, Analysis of polymorphisms in GABRA2 and AUTS2 genes in patients with alcoholism from Russia,P08.02,,"Family, twin and adoption studies have provided evidence of a genetic component (40 60%) in the origins of addictive disorders. One of very few confirmed genetic association findings differentiating alcoholics from non alcoholics is with variants in the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid a2 receptor subunit (GABRA2 ) gene. Also according to the recent genome  wide association study variation in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2 ) was strongly associated with alcohol consumption. Population  stratification and ancestry differences within populations may compromise the success of association studies. Therefore analysis of genes variants in homogeneous ethnic groups is of great importance.We designed a classical case control association study for two polymorphis   ms: rs279858 in GABRA2  and rs6943555 in AUTS2  that were tested for asso   ciation with alcoholism. 307 men with ICD 10 diagnosis of alcoholism (112 Russians, 91 Tatars, 100 Bashkirs), and matched control groups were typed for the above mentioned gene variants using PCR RFLP technique.In Russian population the frequency of individuals carrying the *G allele of  rs279858 polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with early onset alcoholism as compared with the healthy controls (p,0.03;OR,1.40). The carriers of GABRA2*A/*A  genotype were found to be at low risk of al   coholism development (p,0.04;OR,0,57). In Tatars the frequency of AUTS2   rs6943555 *T allele was higher in group of alcoholics with acute alcohol  psychosis (0.74) as compared with controls (0.64). However observed diffe rences were not statistically significant.Our results suggest that GABRA2  genetic variation might be involved in the  development of alcoholism in Russians.

1290,921, New genes for normal hearing function and age related hearing loss by genome wide association and expression studies,P08.31,,"Trieste, (Trieste Italy), Trieste,  Italy, 2Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton,  Cambridge Uk, Hinxton Uk, United Kingdom. Little is known about the molecular bases of normal hearing function and age related hearing loss (ARHL) or presbycusis. Thus, research still needs to study hearing as a complex trait and to understand genetic factors un derlying ARHL. To reach this goal an integrated strategy has been designed based on: A) GWAS on hearing quantitative traits as well as on ARHL qua litative traits, and B) expression studies in wildtype mice (at 4 and 5 days postnatal) using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy of genes identified by the GWAS. Up to now, for hearing quantitative traits we have run 2 meta analyses of GWAS data (one with 6 isolated European populati   ons and 1 adding samples from Caucasus and Central Asia), while for ARHL (qualitative traits) a candidate gene analysis has been performed. Matching all the data we defined a list of 27 candidate genes that have been chosen for expression analysis. 5 candidate genes show strikingly specific expression in the cochlea (e.g at the top of sensory hair cells and in the marginal cells of the stria vascularis) while the other 12 are located in multiple cell types in the cochlea. Additional studies now in progress include the identification of variants in genes confirmed by expression analysis, the development of mouse models, and replication of the data.In conclusion, preliminary results prove the useful combination of GWAS and expression studies in providing new insights into the molecular basis of hearing function and ARHL, and may suggest new targets for hearing im pairment treatment and prevention.",2012.0,,"G.

GWAS have found more than 26 regions for CD susceptibility, and several potentially functional can didate genes have been located within. Recently, the IMMUNOCHIP geno typing array discovered additional 13 regions of susceptibility. The GWAS signal in chromosome 6:128.0 128.4 kb pointed to THEMIS and PTPRK as possible candidate genes, both with immune related function. The signal was narrowed to the PTPRK region in the subsequent study, but functional confirmation is pending.The aim of this work was to determine the influence of associated SNPs on THEMIS and PTPRK gene expression in the intestinal mucosa of active and treated CD patients and controls.We assessed the correlation between qPCR expression levels and SNP genotypes of the top SNPs in both studies (rs802734, rs55743914 and rs72975916) and those most strongly associated in our CEGEC population (rs10484718 and rs9491896).THEMIS showed higher expression in active CD compared to treated pati   ents and controls, while PTPRK showed lower expression. Our study confir   med an association of this region with CD in the local population, although only rs802734 genotype showed any influence in THEMIS expression.

Ho   wever, their contribution to pathomechanisms remains elusive. Three SNPs in the HTR3A and HTR3B genes have been associated with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) in pilot studies, and all of them are of functional relevance.We performed a European multicenter study to confirm previous results and provide further evidence for the relevance of these SNPs for neuro psychiatric disorders. This involved analysis of the distribution of the three SNPs among 1804 BPAD cases and 2407 healthy controls. A meta analysis revealed a pooled odds ratio of 0.881 (P , 0.009, 95% CI , 0.802   0.968) for the non synonymous functional SNP HTR3B p.Y129S (rs1176744), there by confirming previous findings.

Imputation is the conventional approach for avoiding loss of SNPs in meta  analysis (MA) of genome wide association studies (GWASes) with differing  SNP panels. Here we present an alternative, fast method to avoid forfeiting  SNPs present in only a subset of studies, without relying on time consuming imputation. This is accomplished by using reference linkage disequilibrium  (LD) data from 1,000 Genomes/HapMap projects to find proxy SNPs to  gether with in phase alleles for SNPs missing in at least one study. MA is conducted by combining association effect estimates of a SNP and those of its proxy SNPs. Our algorithm is implemented in the MA tool YAMAS (Yet  Another Meta Analysis Software). Association results from GWAS analysis applications can be used as input files for MA, tremendously speeding up MA compared to the conventional  imputation approach. Furthermore, analysis of sex chromosomal markers  with YAMAS is readily available, while it can otherwise pose difficulties be cause of lack of universal implementation in imputing tools.We show that our proxy algorithm is well powered and yields valuable ad hoc results, possibly providing an incentive for follow up. In addition, it is more robust if the data contains cohort specific LD patterns. We propose our method as a standard approach for studies without available reference data matching the ethnicities of study participants.

1332,1165, Heterodisomy at 20q as a cause of Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ib,P11.056,,"Introducction: Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ib results from epigenetic GNAS defects. Familial and sporadic forms of PHP Ib have been reported with di stinct GNAS imprinting patterns: familial PHP Ib patients have an exon A/B only imprinting defect whereas sporadic cases have abnormal imprinting of the four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in GNAS. In addition, they present a different underlying genetic alteration.Objective: to analyze the methylation pattern at GNAS locus in a patient diagnosed with Pseudohypoparathyroidism Ib and to identify underlying molecular genetic defect(s).Design: We have studied dosage and methylation pattern at GNAS locus in the patient and her family by MS MLPA. We also analyzed microsatellite and SNP markers along chromosome 20 looking for causative molecular altera tion.Results: We found that the index case and one of her brothers presented an altered methylation pattern at GNAS locus. It seems that the genetic altera tion causative of this epigenetic defect was a paternal heterodisomy at least at 20q13.13.Conclusion: Our work underlines the importance of analyzing apparently healthy family members of affected patients because of the subtle clinical features.

1333,1215, A simple method for improving the limit of detection for capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencing a comparison of methodologies for KRAS variant detection,P11.115,,"Fluorescent dye terminator Sanger sequencing (FTSS), with detection by au   tomated capillary electrophoresis (CE), has long been regarded as the gold standard for variant detection. However, software analysis and base calling algorithms used to detect mutations were largely optimized for resequen   cing applications in which different alleles were expected at heterozygous mixtures of 50%. Increasingly, the requirements for variant detection are an analytic sensitivity for minor alleles of <20%, in particular, when assessing the mutational status of heterogeneous tumor samples. Here we describe a simple modification to the FTSS workflow that improves the limit of de   tection of cell line gDNA mixtures from 50 20% to 5% for G>A transitions and from 50 5% to 5% for G>C and G>T transversions. In addition, we use two different sample types to compare the limit of detection of sequence variants in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene between Sanger sequencing and other methodologies including shifted termination assay (STA) detec tion, single base extension (SBE), pyrosequencing (PS), high resolution melt (HRM), and real time PCR (qPCR).",2012.0,,"C.

When multihormonal resistance is also pre sent (mainly, PTH and TSH), the disorder might be clinically misdiagnosed as pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP Ia). Acrodysostosis with multi   hormonal resistance is caused by mutations in PRKAR1A, which participa tes in the GsÃÂ± protein signaling pathway.Patients and methods: PRKAR1A was sequenced in five PHP Ia patients with negative genetic and epigenetic analysis in GNAS locus.Results: A heterozygous mutation in PRKAR1A was identified in three of the five patients. Parental testing showed that the mutation arose de novo in the three cases. A detailed analysis of clinical and radiological data revealed the characteristic bone abnormalities of acrodysostosis. Conclusion: Acrodysostosis is an infradiagnosed disorder that might be con  founded with PHP Ia.

Although all three variants affect spine volume and have smaller SHANK2 cluster sizes, T1127M additionally fails to rescue spine volume in Shank2 knock down neurons. R462X is not able to rescue spine volume and dendritic branching and lacks postsynaptic clustering, indicating the most severe dysfunction. To demonstrate that R462X when expressed in mouse can be linked to phy   siological effects, we analyzed synaptic transmission and behavior. Princi   pal neurons of mice expressing rAAV transduced SHANK2 R462X present a specific, long lasting reduction in miniature postsynaptic AMPA receptor currents. This dominant negative effect translates into dose dependent alte red cognitive behavior of SHANK2 R462X expressing mice, with an impact on the penetrance of ASD.",2012.0,,"S. Berkel1, W. Tang2, M.

The diagnosis of autism is based on impairments in reciprocal social interaction  and communication, and restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests  and activities, with abnormal development apparent within the first 3 years of life. Autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) include: autistic disorder, child  hood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not other   wise specified, Asperger syndrome and Rett syndrome. There is substantial  evidence from twin and family studies to support the involvement of genetic factors in ASDs. We report a case of 3 years old boy with echolalia, irrelevant talk, not com  prehensible. Muttered to himself occasionally, poor social interaction and avoided eye contact. He was unable to follow commands and responded to  his name very rarely. The child was born after 8 yrs of a non consanguineous  marriage, gestation was controlled and it was a full term caesarean delivery. The provisional clinical diagnosis was autistic features with hyperactivity.  Karyotype was normal, X fragile syndrome analysis was normal too and  was performed a genetic analysis using MLPA (SALSA ÃÂ®MLPAÃÂ® Subtelome  ric Screening P070, X linked mental retardation P106 and Microdeletion  Syndromes P245). Analysis results showed a deletion in SHANK3 gene in  22q13.3.

A new homoplasmic substitusion, A15973G, was identified within the T loop of tRNA Pro gene in 1 patient as  it had not been reported before. This variation is moderatelyly conserved (75 %) among species and also, was not detected in blood sample from the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother.Conclusion: Investigation on mitochondrial varations may strengthen the role of genetics in association with autism.

1391,4, C terminal deletions of the AUTS2 locus cause distinct syndromic features and cognitive impairment,PL2.2,,"Translocations involving 7q21.22 have been associated with autism and in tellectual disability (ID). Discordant evidence has suggested that these cli nical phenotypes might be driven by a number of genes (AUTS2, WBSCR17, CALN1). Here, we examined whether AUTS2 disruptions are causal for neu  rocognitive defects.An international cohort of ~50,000 patients and 16,000 controls was ex   amined for CNVs in AUTS2 by array CGH and we performed detailed pheno  typic analyses. 5âRACE experiments were performed to test for alternative transcripts in human brain. A zebrafish knock down model was generated to test the potential of different AUTS2  splice isoforms to induce some of the  anatomical phenotypes seen in patients.We found 44 AUTS2 deletions. Microdeletions disrupting the coding se   quence were causal to a complex syndromic ID/autism phenotype including short stature, microcephaly, cerebral palsy and distinct facial dysmorphis   ms. The exonic AUTS2 deletions occur with a frequency comparable to NSD1  deletions causing Sotos syndrome. We also discovered a novel, highly con served, C terminal AUTS2 isoform in human brain. Clinical and functional  studies showed this isoform to be a key contributor to the human phenotype because (a) patients with C terminal deletions exhibited significantly more severe and pleiotropic aspects of AUTS2  syndrome, and (b) the significant  microcephaly and craniofacial defects seen in auts2 knockdown zebrafish  embryos were rescued by this C terminal isoform.We identified a hitherto unappreciated syndromic phenotype caused by deletions in AUTS2,  required for both brain and craniofacial development.  The C terminal portion of the gene contributes significantly to the pheno type, demonstrating how transcriptional complexity can underpin human pathology.  E. Voorhoeve: None. G. Beunders: None. C.

1393,17,"The search for bone and joint genes, and what to do with them?",S02.1,,"Height, osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) have strong genetic influ ences and efforts try to identify the causal genes. Knowledge of these gene  variants can help in understanding biology of the disease process and be  nefit development of interventions, but also have potential for diagnostics. Genome Wide Association studies (GWAS) builds upon (1) human genetic  variation, (2) genotyping technology, (3) bio banks, and (4) collaboration  among researchers in consortia. For height this is the GIANT consortium, for osteoporosis GEFOS/GENOMOS, and for osteoarthritis TREAT OA.GWAS has proven to be widely successful and for height, OP , OA, and Pagetâs  Disease several GWAS have been published. For example, 80 loci have been  identified for bone mineral density (BMD), ~600 loci for height, and sever al loci for Pagetâs and OA. Please note that a) GWAS identifies DNA variants rather then genes, and b) the effects per variant are generally modest, e.g., with Odds Ratios ranging from 1.1  1.7, and explained variance of combined common variants, e.g., for height being 25% and for BMD being 3 7 %. While dozens of new loci have been discovered in GWAS, translation takes more time because a) discoveries are recent, b) there are many to choose from, and c) the conservative nature of ânon hypothesis freeâ scientists.Together with studies on rare genetic syndromes, the GWAS approach clarifies the genetic architecture of the skeleton and bone and joint disease. GWAS based on SNP arrays are assessing only a small part, i.e., 0.2%, of the base pairs constituting the human genome. Next Generation Sequencing technology and exome ar rys now allows to asses all coding parts of the genome (~5% of bp) and even the majority of base pairs by full genome sequencing (~95% of bp). These approaches are now underway in Mendelian and complex disease, and for the latter again involve association approaches in large consortia.  A.G. Uitterlinden:  None.",2013.0,,"A. G.

1399,80,The genome structure of the Dutch population,C01.6,,"Louis, MO, United States. On behalf of GONL consortiumThe Genome of the Netherlands project (GoNL, http://nlgenome.nl) aims to create a map of genetic variants through whole genome sequencing of 250 families representing 11 Dutch provinces. Here we report results from the analysis of structural variation employing several complementary approa ches. We detected a wide spectrum of genetic variants including short in dels, deletions, insertions, tandem duplications, inversions, mobile element insertions and translocations.Short indels and structural variants (SVs). Using the consensus of 4 callers (GATK_UG, PINDEL, CLEVER and SOAPdenovo assembly) we predicted 1,196,767 small indels of which 1,413 are causing premature stop codons  and frameshifts in 1,285 genes. On average, we observed 134 frameshift and  19 splice site mutations per individual genome. By combining different stra tegies: read depth (CNVnator, DWAC Seq, Facade), read pair (123SV, Break   Dancer), combined approaches (PINDEL, GenomeSTRiP , CLEVER), de novo assembly (SOAPdenovo) we predicted over 10 thousand variants represen   ting different SV types and size ranges. Validation of structural variant sets. We performed targeted resequencing  to: i) determine the false positive rate for different approaches/tools; ii) va lidate loss of function variants; iii) confirm novel genomic segments, absent in the current genome reference; iv) verify de novo structural events Significance. In combination with GoNL SNP set (reported separately) these  results comprehensively describe common genetic variants in individuals of Dutch origin. This variation catalogue is essential for understanding mecha  nisms of SV formation, their population dynamics and history. It provides an  essential resource for the interpretation of GWAS results and the genomes of other West European individuals with constitutional or acquired disorders.  V. Guryev: None. W.

To do this, we undertook whole exome sequencing of >10,000 individuals from five ethnic backgrounds, including African Americans, Mexican Ame ricans, Europeans (Finnish and Ashkenazim), South Asians (Indian Asians from London and Singapore), and East Asians (Chinese in Singapore and Koreans), half of whom were diagnosed with T2D. We present here initial results from 5,334 individuals (African American, East and South Asian) for lipids. We tested the hypothesis that low frequency (LF, MAF<5%) variants contribute to variation in lipid levels. We identified 1.8 million exome va riants, 91% rare (MAF<0.5%), 5% LF, and 4% common. In covariate adju  sted, single variant fixed effects meta analyses, we have detected genome  wide significant associations (p<5x10  8) within known GWAS signals: CETP  (p,1.03x10 10) and LIPC  (p,1.9x10 8) for HDL,  TOMM40 ( p,6.6x10 14) and  PVRL2  (p,1.7x10 8) for LDL, and APOA5  (p,7.8x10 19) for triglycerides. The   re were suggestive associations at APOA5  (p,9.9x10 8) and LPL ( p,4.9x10 7)  for HDL, and ADAMTSL3  (p,1.6x10 6) for LDL. LF variant analysis employing  aggregate tests with SKAT across all individuals identified associations with  the several previously implicated genes including CETP ( p,1.4x10 7) and  APOA5  (p,2.7 x10 6) for HDL, and PCSK9 ( p,3.6x10 6) for LDL.

Our aim was to detect novel associated loci; low frequency va riants influencing trait variability and novel independent variants at known loci. We performed large scale fixed effects meta analysis of GWAS data including up to 38 million SNPs imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (06/2011 release). The analysis was performed in up to 18 European GWAS, for fasting glucose (FG, n,46,694), fasting insulin (FI, n,24,245), body mass index (BMI, n,87,048) and waist to hip ratio adju sted for BMI (WHR, n,54,572).We identified novel loci at genome wide significance for FG (1 locus near RMST, p,2.0x10  10, MAF,0.10) and BMI (5 loci near GALNT10 , DTX2P1 ,  GRID1 , EPYC  and AKAP6 ; p<4.5x10 8, MAF,0.07~0.49). Through conditional  analysis, we identified a novel low frequency variant associated with FG in dependent of the lead SNP at G6PC2 (2 169748691, MAF,0.012, p,3.0x10   19, conditional p,1.7x10 21). At a known locus for WHR, RSPO3, we detected  a novel independent lead signal with stronger association and larger effect size than the previously reported signal (new Î²,0.11, p,1.7x10  13, MAF,0.08  vs. old Î²,0.04, p,2.1x10 11, MAF,0.49).

Genetic factors have been known to play an important role in the development of IA. Here, we conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify common genetic variants that are associated with IA by using 1383 aSAH subjects and 5484 controls from the Japanese population. The variants that showed suggestive association in the GWAS were validated in an independent set of  1048 IA cases and 7212 controls. We identified, rs6842241, near EDNRA  at  chromosome 4q31.22 (combined P value , 9.58 Ã 10 9; odds ratio , 1.25),  to be significantly associated with IA.

1447,458,Genome wide association study in animal model of vision disorders,P03.09,,"Purebred dogs suffer from hereditary vision disorders, which resembles corresponding disorders in humans. Our study has focused on the genetics of retinal dysplasia (RD) and vitreous degeneration (VD) in two different dog breeds, American Cocker Spaniel (ACS) and Italian Greyhound (IT), re spectively. Both disorders are known to be inherited in the breeds, but the genetic background has remained unknown. Both disorders may cause visi   on deterioration and secondary complications may include glaucoma, lens luxation and retinal detachment, which in turn may lead to a complete blind ness. We have established a large sample cohort for multifocal RD in ACS and for VD in IT . A genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed using canine specific SNP array to map the associated loci in both disorders.The GWAS data identified a genome widely significant association for MRD in ACS on canine chromosome 22 (CFA22) with p raw,1.9*10 5, pgenome,0.01  and a tentative association, with a 2 Mb homozygous haplotype, for VD in IT on CFA15 with p raw,5.1x10 5, pgenome,0.27. Further replication studies are  being performed to confirm and to define the associated regions.Two novel loci were mapped for two canine vision disorders. Ongoing can didate gene sequencing is likely to open new insights to the molecular back   ground of the studied conditions. The identification of genes behind these disorders will establish a large animal model for the corresponding human disorders and the associated genes can be studied in humans. While the as sociated genes will become candidates for human studies, a genetic test can be offered for the studied breeds.  S.J. Ahonen: None. H. Lohi:  E.

Although pathognomonic for Aicardi syndrome (AS), PCRL are seen in other conditions including microcephaly with chorioretinal degeneration, oral facial digital, oculo auricular syndromes.AS is characterized by agenesis of corpus callosum, seizures and PCRL. Inhe ritance is presumed X linked dominant but causative gene is unknown. We present girl without the classic AS triad who had PCRL due to chromosome 3 microdeletion.18 month old girl was evaluated for speech, motor delays, staring spells. She was born at 32 weeks gestation to pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. At birth, was noted to have left hand preaxial polydactyly, atrial septal de   fect, pulmonary valvular stenosis. Examination disclosed flat nasal bridge, ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 123Back to index epicanthal folds, wide mouth, retromicrognathia, truncal hypotonia. Retinal  examination showed bilateral PCRL, which consisted of depigmented areas  with variably pigmentated borders, surrounding optic discs. MRI revealed  mild thinning of corpus callosum and diffuse hypomyelination.Genomic hybridization microarray demonstrated 6 megabase interstitial  deletion of chromosome 3, spanning 3q21.3 to 3q22.1. Conclusions: PCRL are not unique to Aicardi syndrome.AS is thought to arise from gene mutation on X chromosome. Our patientâs large autosomal deletion comprised 66 genes, none known to be associated  with chorioretinal lacunae. It is possible that PCRL in our and patients with  AS may result from complex gene interactions between the X chromosome and autosomes. Because our patient had autosomal microdeletion, we recommend chromo  somal microarray be performed in patients with PCRL when neurological features do not correspond to those in AS.  R.

1452,494,Whole genome analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variants in fibromyalgia suggest a role for the central nervous system,P03.47,,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a highly disabling syndrome defined by a low pain threshold and a permanent state of pain. The mechanisms explaining this complex disorder remain unclear and its genetic factors have not been iden   tified. The aim of this study was to elucidate genetic susceptibility factors for FM.We used the Illumina 1 million duo array to perform a genomewide asso   ciation study (GWAS), and Agilentâs 2X400K platform for array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to identify regions varying in copy number that could be involved in FM susceptibility.GWAS was performed in 300 FM cases and 203 controls. No SNP reached GWAS significance, but 21 of the most associated SNPs were chosen for re plication in over 900 cases and 900 pain free controls. Four of the strongest associated SNPs selected for replication showed a nominal association in the joint analysis, and one, rs11127292 (MYT1L) was found to be associated to FM with low comorbidities (p,4.28X10 5, OR (95%CI),0.58 (0.44 0.75). By aCGH, an intronic deletion in NRXN3 showed to be associated to female cases of FM with low levels of comorbidities (p,0.021, OR (95%CI), 1.46 (1.05 2.04)).Both GWAS and aCGH results point at a role for the central nervous system in FM genetic susceptibility. If the proposed FM candidate genes are further validated in replication studies, this would highlight a neurocognitive invol vement in this disorder, currently considered musculoskeletal and affective.

We recently reported in silico  replication study for AF susceptible chromosomal loci identified Caucasian descent by a genome wide association study (GWAS) results in a Japanese population 1). Here, to further validate the results of the Japanese GWAS and  to identify novel AF susceptible loci, we genotyped the high ranking single nucleotide polymorphisms in the GWAS with additional samples of approxi mately 1,600 cases and 17,100 controls in the Japanese. Through combina tion of the GWAS results, the known AF locus on chromosome 4q25, close to ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 132Back to index PITX2, showed extremely strong association (P < 10 150). Other three known  loci, CAV1 locus on 7q31, ZFHX3 locus on 16q22 and PRRX1  locus on 1q24,  were also validated with statistical significance (P < 1.0 x 10 8). Furthermo   re, we identified two novel association signal on chromosome 10 and 12 (P  < 5 x 10 8). Interestingly, the four genes (PITX2, PRRX1 , ZFHX3 and the gene  on chromosome 12) encode transcription related factors with homeobox  domain found in proteins related to cardiopulmonary development and/or  differentiation. Stratification by age at diagnosis revealed that the greater odds ratios observed in the younger age than the older one on the three  loci, PITX2, CAV1, 2  and chromosome 12. By combination of the six genetic  factors, the odds ratio has risen to 4.5. These results indicate that the genetic  factors significantly contribute to the etiology of AF in the Japanese. 1)Ellinor PT et al., Nature Genetics 44, 670 675 (2012).  K. Ozaki: None. T.

Extremely rare is association of Phelan McDer   mid syndrome and hepatic failure in early childhood. There have been de  scribed only 2 patients with this condition so far. In these cases PIM3 gene  (localized in 22q13.33) was considered to be responsible. We present 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with Phelan McDermid syn drome. Age at diagnosis ranges from 10 month to 55 years and deletion ex   tent varies from 0.4 Mb to 7.6 Mb. All patients present common features  of the syndrome, but they differ in inconstant sypmtoms. Any correlations  between phenotype and deletion range havenâ²t been observed.Patients have been diagnosed using FISH and MLPA, deletion extents were  proven by oligonucleotide arrayCGH. There are 6 patients with deleted PIM3 gene in our group, including two adult patients, but only one of these patients (10 year old boy with 1.9 Mb  long deletion) has developed hepatic failure recently. Therefore simple PIM3  deletion doesnâ²t seem to be the cause of hepatic failure.The possible mechanism is an alteration of the gene on the other allele, epi genetic factors or mutation in some modifier genes.

Here we report a five year old girl with mental and motor retarda  tion, epilepsy, and dysmorphic findings with normal constitutional karyo  type. To determine the genetic contribution in the development of clinical findings, aCGH analysis was performed. Roche NimbleGen Human CGH ISCA  Plus 3x1.4M Array was used for aCGH analysis. The data were analyzed by  using Nexus6 software (BioDiscovery). As a result of aCGH analysis, 5 chro mosomal regions were marked as important regions. Among these regions, one of them has been found to be related with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, previously. Microdeletion in the PTCHD1 locus on  Xp22.11 has been has been found in autism spectrum patients but not in he alty controls. However, we found a 24.3kb copy gain in the same locus in our patient. This finding showed that PTCHD1 locus may not be disrupted with  deletion only, copy gain in that region might also have effect on the gene, and its function.

Background: The genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates.Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort.

Background: The genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates.Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort.

1480,648, BKCa channels: a new therapeutic target in Fragile X Syndrome treatment,P05.067,,"The most common cause of inherited mental deficiency (MD) associated  with autistic features, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), results from the FMR1 gene  silencing and loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among synaptic proteins deregulated by the absence of Fmrp in fmr1  knock out  (KO) mice (murine model for FXS), Kcnma1 (Î± subunit of large conductance Ca 2+ activated potassium channels, BKCa) seems to be the most significant  deregulated one. Since several papers showed an involvement of BKCa chan nels in MD, this channel could be a new therapeutic target for FXS. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the molecular BKCa channel anomaly in fmr1  KO mouse model and 2) to evaluate the thera  peutic effect of a BKCa channel opener molecule (BCOM), BMS 204352, on dendritic spines maturation of fmr1  KO neurons and on social behavior of  fmr1  KO mice. In fmr1  KO mice, Kcnma1 protein quantity was lower in ce  rebral structures and neurons, and associated with a reduced BKCa whole cell current. In vitro addition of BMS 204352 induced dendrite spines ma  turation of fmr1  KO neurons. In vivo, using a behavioral test of direct social  interaction, a single injection of BMS 204352 rescued affiliative behaviors to wild type level. In conclusion, we demonstrated 1) a Kcnma1 protein anomaly in fmr1  KO  mice inducing a decrease in BKCa whole cell current, and 2) that a BCOM, BMS 204352, restored a regular phenotype of dendrite spines and social interaction in fmr1  KO mice. Therefore, BKCa channel could be a new thera  peutic target in FXS treatment.  B. Hebert: None. O. Perche: None. A. Menuet: None. N. Doisne: None. J. Pichon:  None. B. Laudier: None. S.

1482,651,Study of a large Spanish cohort of 22q13 deletion syndromeÂ´s patients. A genotype phenotype correlation?,P05.070,,"Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the deletion or disruption of a 22q13 region containing the post synaptic protein gene SHANK3 . The clinical features of PMS (also known  as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and otherdevelopmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmor   phic features. Other less frequent features include seizures, brain, renal and cardiac malformations, motor deficits, and lymphedema Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, Clinical expression also varies widely, even among patients with small deletions, and no correlation between deletion size and phenotype has been found. A role for additional genetic factors, in addition to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, is likely. Because PMS is considered  to be underdiagnosed, the true prevalence is unknown. Aims. We aim to define a possible genotype phenotype comparison to use  high resolution deletion breakpoint mapping on a large cohort of patients, addressed the hypothesis that additional genes or regions of chromosome  22q13 besides SHANK3 may contribute to the PMS phenotype. Results. Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for more than 50  individuals in a patient cohort using a custom designed high resolution oli  gonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform, prompting  this genotype phenotype association study. Most of them have been studied by FISH, MLPA and array CGH and their clinical features have been defined.  Interestingly, a great genetic variability, with deletion sizes between 10 Kb  and as much as 9 MB was found.Conclusions.

We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p.Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family. A functional test of HUWE1   activity on DNA repair is currently performed on patientâs cells to confirm its pathogenicity.  Y. Alembik: None. J. Lauer Zillhardt:  None. B. Gerard: None. C.

MedykÃ³w 18,,  Katowice, Poland. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation respon   sible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1  gene resulting in its transcriptional silencing. Leptin may be  considered a cytokine like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, immune system, in addition to its role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. Thus, we hypothesized on in volvement of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of autism.Material and methods23 male patients, mean age 19,3 Â± 6,6, affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1  gene), were enrolled into the study. Controls were 24  healthy males, mean age 21,8 Â± 5,8. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA method.ResultsPlasma leptin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients were similar as in con trol group (11,53 Â± 10,24 ng/ml) vs (5,73 Â± 4,52) were not significantly dif   ferent from those found in controls (p , 0,5).While plasma adiponectin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients (6,68 Â± 3,44 ng/ml) were significantly lower in controls (8,95 Â± 4,24) (p< 0,04).ConclusionAdiponectin may be involved in autistic features observed in FXS patients in light of its anti inflammatory properties.

1493,689, 20 ans aprÃ¨s: a second family with mutation in X linked monoamine oxidase A gene affecting cognition and behavior,P05.109,,"Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an extraordinary genetic he terogeneity, with more than 200 genes implicated in monogenic forms. This complexity precluded systematic testing for mutations and because clini cal features are often non specific, for some of these genes only few cases or families have been unambiguously documented. It is the case of the the X linked gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), for which only one nonsense mutation has been identified in Brunner syndrome, characterized in one unique family by borderline ID and impulsive and aggressive behavi ors. We have developed targeted NGS sequencing of 220 ID genes in patients with undiagnosed ID. We identified a p.C266F missense mutation in MAOA in a boy with autistic features and behavioral disturbances. He has good ver   bal comprehension but IQ could not be measured due to attention deficit and heterogeneous results in WISC IV test. Two maternal uncles carry the mutation and have severe ID, with a history of maltreatment in early child hood. The phenotype overlaps with Brunner syndrome. This novel missense mutation decreases MAOA activity, as shown by abnormal levels of urinary monoamines and by measurement of enzymatic activity. The identification of this point mutation confirms, for the first time since 1993, the monogenic implication of the MAOA gene in ID, autistic features and behavioral abnor malities. Variable expressivity might be due to environmental factors. We will discuss possible therapeutic options and hypotheses that could account for the very long time lag between the initial and highly publicized report and the finding of a second family.  A.

1493,689, 20 ans aprÃ¨s: a second family with mutation in X linked monoamine oxidase A gene affecting cognition and behavior,P05.109,,"Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an extraordinary genetic he terogeneity, with more than 200 genes implicated in monogenic forms. This complexity precluded systematic testing for mutations and because clini cal features are often non specific, for some of these genes only few cases or families have been unambiguously documented. It is the case of the the X linked gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), for which only one nonsense mutation has been identified in Brunner syndrome, characterized in one unique family by borderline ID and impulsive and aggressive behavi ors. We have developed targeted NGS sequencing of 220 ID genes in patients with undiagnosed ID. We identified a p.C266F missense mutation in MAOA in a boy with autistic features and behavioral disturbances. He has good ver   bal comprehension but IQ could not be measured due to attention deficit and heterogeneous results in WISC IV test. Two maternal uncles carry the mutation and have severe ID, with a history of maltreatment in early child hood. The phenotype overlaps with Brunner syndrome. This novel missense mutation decreases MAOA activity, as shown by abnormal levels of urinary monoamines and by measurement of enzymatic activity. The identification of this point mutation confirms, for the first time since 1993, the monogenic implication of the MAOA gene in ID, autistic features and behavioral abnor malities. Variable expressivity might be due to environmental factors. We will discuss possible therapeutic options and hypotheses that could account for the very long time lag between the initial and highly publicized report and the finding of a second family.  A.

1494,690,"Microduplication disrupting the MYT1L gene in a familial case of intellectual disability, and neuropsychiatric disorder.",P05.110,,"MYT1L is a member of the myelin transcription factor 1 gene family and is highly expressed in mouse embryonic brain. MYT1L interacts directly with  DISC1, which is involved in schizophrenia. We describe a family in which  the father, his son and his daughter have a 549 kb interstitial duplication in the 2p25.3 region detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and  confirmed by quantitative PCR. This duplication encompasses the five first  exons and is predicted to disrupt the MYT1L gene. The phenotype includes:  slight facial features including bulbous nasal tip, wide mouth, overfolded helix, strabismus, moderate intellectual disability (ID) with speech impedi   ment, hypotonia, hyperactivity, mood disorder with aggressive behaviour, neonatal feeding difficulties followed by a tendency to hyperphagia with overweight and a prominent abdomen with thick panniculus adiposus. Par  tial deletions of chromosome band 2p25.3 encompassing the MYT1L gene  have been reported in patients presenting with ID and overweight whereas  duplications disrupting the MYT1L gene have been reported in patients pre  senting with autism and schizophrenia. Moreover, single nucleotide poly   morphisms (SNPs) of MYT1L contribute to major depressive disorder and  schizophrenia. Recently, de Ligt et al. reported a âde novoâ splice site mu tation of the MYT1L gene identified by exome sequencing in a patient with  severe ID, autistic features, neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, as well as mild facial features.This report and previous publications strongly suggest that alterations of  the MYT1L gene are responsible for diverse neuropsychiatric disorders with  intellectual disability and a tendency to overweight.

It is characterized by developmental regression, acquired mi crocephaly, loss of purposeful hand use and speech, stereotypic hand mo vements, autistic features, gait apraxia, breathing anomalies, and seizures. Mutations in other genes have been identified in early onset seizure variant (CDKL5) and congenital variant (FOXG1) of Rett syndrome. We report the results of molecular analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 genes in patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features from Czech Republic.MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing of coding regions and exon/intron boundaries. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions in all three genes were analy   zed by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification.We identified MECP2 mutations in 65 out of 86 patients with classic Rett syndrome (76%). 20 patients with Rett syndrome variants were initially screened for MECP2 mutations and 6 MECP2 mutations were identified (30%). The subsequent analysis of CDKL5 gene in patients with early onset seizure variant revealed mutations in 2 cases (6,7%).

1501,706, Characterization of novel âde novoâ mutation in the SLC6A8 gene,P05.127,,"Introduction: Cerebral creatine deficiency is an X linked disorder caused by mutations in the SLC6A8  gene (Xq28). It consists of 13 exons and encodes a  protein of 635 amino acids. This disorder causes an increase of creatine le vels in urine and plasma, and urinary creatine/creatinine ratio. The clinical presentation of males affected is mental retardation, expressive speech and language delay, epilepsy, developmental delay and autistic behaviour.Subjects and Methods: An 8 year old male patient presents learning diffi   culties, behaviour disorder and epilepsy. An increase of creatine/creatinine ratio, guanidineacetate and glycine levels (plasma and urine) was detected. The 13 exons of the SLC6A8 gene, including the intron exon junctions, were  analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction.Results: We detected a 34 pb deletion (c.1016+11_1017 52del34) in intron 6, that was predicted to cause an aberrant splicing into acceptor splice site. At the cDNA level, this mutation produces a 30 pb deletion in exon 7 and a single amino acid insertion (p. K339_S349delinsN). This variant was not detected in the mother and is therefore considered de novo.Discussion: DNA and RNA analysis were necessary to characterize this novel pathogenic mutation. The detected change in the creatine transporter could be responsible for a lower and/or no activity of the protein. Functional stu dies in cultured skin fibroblasts will be necessary to show  a deficiency of the  creatine transporter function.   J. Aguirre Lamban: None. C. Cervera Acedo:  None. E. Sarasola: None.

CNVs ranged from 5 kb to 3 Mb, and 67% were deletions. However, genic CNVs, which represented 53% of all CNVs, were more frequently duplications (65%). Genic CNVs integrated between 1 and 17 genes, and included genes implicated in ASD etiology like NRXN1 and CHD2, as well as novel genes.  CNVs were mainly inherited, with only 10% de novo. We further evaluated the presence of autistic traits in parents, using appro priate questionnaires, and the type of inheritance of the CNV (inherited vs  de novo). We observed a significant excess of autistic traits in the fathers  that transmitted CNVs, mainly for the âaloofâ personality, defined as lak   king interest in social interaction. Analysis of familial correlation data from  parents and probands showed a significant correlation between parents. We  therefore show evidence for an excess of subthreshold autistic traits in CNV transmitting parents of children with ASD, particularly for paternal trans mission. We also observed a tendency for assortative mating in families of  affected individuals, in particular for inherited CNVs. We conclude that a large fraction of CNVs are inherited and correlate with autistic traits in parents in the studied sample.  I.C. ConceiÃ§Ã£o: None. C. Correia: None. B. Oliveira: None. M.M.

1510,734,Mosaic copy number variation in the autism and schizophrenia brain: providing a basis for a new (mitotic) theory of neuropsychiatric diseases,P06.13,,"A plethora of data on germ line genomic rearrangements in brain disorders including autism and schizophrenia does exist. On the other hand, the con  tribution of non heritable genomic alterations to the pathogenesis is hardly  appreciated. Here, we have assessed post zygotic autosomal aneuploidy in prefrontal cortex of the diseased and normal brain by molecular cytogenetic  techniques (FISH and interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding  with DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18). Twel  ve autistic, 19 schizophrenic and 27 control samples provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental disorders, University of Maryland and bank of our institute were analyzed. Aneuploidy rate per autosome was 0.3  0.8% in all three cohorts analyzed (0.46%, 0.62% and 0.59%). However, we  observed statistically significant increase of chromosome 9 aneuploidy in  the autistic brain. In schizophrenia, chromosome 1 and 18 aneuploidy rates were significantly increased. Additionally, we performed array CGH and in silico analysis of our data on genomic rearrangements in childhood neuro  developmental diseases (124 individuals) and found that CNV burdens in  these individuals typically affect two pathways specific for brain cells: cell  cycle regulation and programmed cell death. We concluded that somatic genome variation (chromosome specific mosaic aneuploidy) is a non heri   table genetic factor contributing to pathogenesis of brain disorders, that is,  however, a result of specific CNV burdens.

1517,741, Analysis of the hexonucleotide repeat expansion and founder haplotype at C9ORF72 in an Irish psychosis case control sample.,P06.21,,"A hexonucleotide repeat expansion âGGGGCCâ in an intronic region of the  C9ORF72 gene has been found to account for up to 70% of amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS), and this locus also being implicated in the patho  genesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Study of an independent FTD sample showed a strong association between C9ORF72 mutations and psy   chotic symptoms. We sought to screen a large Irish psychosis case control sample for evidence of association between the repeat expansion and psy   chosis. We carried out haplotype analysis on this region, due to reports of a founder haplotype. Our sample included 1,165 cases and 1,283 controls. We used a reverse primed PCR method to amplify the hexonucleotide repeat expansion. Haplotype analysis was carried out using available GWAS data for these samples. The distribution of repeat numbers was very similar for cases and controls. We identified four samples that carried a repeat number approaching the pathogenic range >30. There were two controls samples (26 and 25 repeats respectively) and two schizophrenia cases (27 and 28 re peats). Haplotype analysis found that for the 512 samples that carried more than 7 repeats, 482 (94%) carried the founder haplotype. The significance of the intermediate number of repeats (between 24 and 29) is still unclear. Haplotype analysis showed a clear association between repeat number and the founder haplotype. It would appear that this haplotype is not unique to ALS FTD cases, but its presence predisposes this region to the repeat expan   sion, and in turn this may lead to a greater risk of molecular instability.

1524,765,Identification of a genomic homozygous deletion of ZNF277 in a child with SLI,P06.48,,"Specific language impairment (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental dis   order in which language abilities are below age expectations, in the absence  of explanatory environmental or medical conditions, such as hearing loss,  intellectual disability or autism. SLI affects 3 7% of English speaking pre  school children. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277   gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex   pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L   genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autistic spectrum dis   orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277  deletions. We observed  an increased frequency of ZNF277  deletions in probands with SLI (6/318,  1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen   dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277  in lymphoblastoid cell lines car  rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found  that, while ZNF277  microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do  not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi  crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 . Given these fin  dings, we postulate that ZNF277  microdeletions may contribute to the risk  of speech and language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risks previously described in this region.

1525,769,Deletion of UBE3A gene in brothers with Angelman syndrome close to breakpoint of inversion at 15q11.2 and 15q26.1,P07.03,,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe intellectual disability  with major speech impairment, ataxia and behavioral uniqueness. The un  derlining molecular deficit is the failure of maternal copy of the imprinted  UBE3A gene due to maternal deletions, the most common present in 70 75%  of case, which is detected by FISH of the UBE3A region. Only a small number of intragenic or whole genomic microdeletions of UBE3A have been repor   ted. We report on two brothers with AS with microdeletion of 15q11.2 q12  emcompassing UBE3A gene, close to breakpoint of inversion at 15q11.2 and  15q26.1. The brothers were the first and second children of unrelated and  healthy parents. They were born at term after uneventful pregnancy. Patient  1 (older brother) had developmental delay, walked with ataxic gait, and did not speak word at 6 years old. He developed seizure at 4 years old. Patient  2 (younger brother) had also developmental delay and started sitting at 15  months. They had mild phenotype and behavior of AS. Karyotype revealed  pericentric inversion of 15q and FISH test revealed deletion of UBE3A re  gion. Array CGH revealed 467kb deletion at 15q11.2 q12, only emcompas sing UBE3A and a part of SNORD115, and 53kb deletion at 15q26.1. Their  mother revealed normal karyoptype and no deletion of 15q11.2 q12 with  array CGH, so we assumed germline mosaicism. This report is a rare familial  case with AS detected by routine FISH test. We suggest that array CGH can  detect atypical submicroscopic deletion of UBE3A in patients with mild AS phenotype.  Y. Kuroda: None. I. Ohashi:  None. T. Naruto: None. K. Ida: None. T. Wada:  None.

1529,843,Genomics of FXT AS (Fragile X associated Tremor Ataxia) mouse brains reveals hallmarks of altered neurodevelopmement and neurodegeneration.,P08.43,,"While FMR1 is silenced in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients carrying the full mutation, its expression is elevated (2 8 fold) in premutated individuals. The se subjects may develop the Fragile X associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and parkinsonism. In addition, people carrying the premutation can be affected by a set of neurological and behavioural disorders during young age. Memory problems have been detected in these patients as well as in the mouse mo del for FXTAS. In those animals, by transcriptome analysis we have shown a profound deregulation of the expression levels of genes involved in learning, memory and autistic behavior, Parkinson disease and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest the presence of a synapthopathy (Zongaro et al., HMG, 2013). Furthermore, we studied gene expression profiles of whole brain ob tained from both young and old FXTAS mice. We observed that in this context different neurodegenerative pathways are involved at different ages. In FXTAS mice, we also studied the expression level of several microRNAs that target FMR1 mRNA and we observed that one them, miR 221, is down regulated  at the synapse of young FXTAS mice and in the full brain of the older ones.  Interestingly, many of those deregulated mRNAs at the synapse, as well as in whole brain, are target of miR 221. These findings suggest a network regula  tion   including miRNAs and mRNAs  for FMR1 mRNA.  S. Zongaro: None. R. Hukema: None. R. Willemsen: None. B. Mari: None. B.  Bardoni: None.",2013.0,,"S.

1535,897,Serious neurologic entity in two unrelated patients with Xq13.1 duplication,P08.99,,"Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, Athens, Greece, 31st Department of  Pediatrics, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 43rd Department of  Pediatrics, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 51 st Department of  Pediatrics, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece. The use of array CGH substantially improves the diagnosis of chromosomal  abnormalities that are not evident by conventional karyotype. Recently in an extended family with global developmental delay and autistic features,  a novel Xq12 q13.3 duplication was identified which contained amongst  others TAF1, GJB1 genes .(Kaya et al.2012).The GJB1 gene is associated with  morphology of myelin sheath and peripheral neuropathy, while TAF1  has  been linked with torsion dystonia  3. We present the clinical and molecular findings in two unrelated patients  with Xq13.1 duplication. The first one is a 5 year old boy with truncal hy   potonia, low deep tendon reflexes and proximal weakness. The other pati   ent is a 16 year old boy with progressive difficulties in walking, tremor and  learning disorder, while his mother has an identical positive family history in three deceased males. High resolution 4X180K Agilent arrays used in the  study (> 236.000 probes, average resolution of 8.9 Kb) revealed a duplicati   on on Xq13.1 (0.423 Mb) containing the TAF1 and GJB1 genes in both pati   ents, while the second patient had an additional deletion on 17q21.31 (0.63  Mb) containing KANSL1  gene. To our knowledge this is the second report  of the Xq13.1 duplication extending the previously described phenotypic  spectrum in that a more serious neurologic entity could be attributed to the  TAF1 and GJB1 genes.

We combined summary statistics (single variant and gene based) of up to 109,227 high quality au   tosomal variants across studies by meta analysis. We identified two LF non  synonymous (NS) variants achieving study wide significance (P<2.5 x 10  7)  in genes not mapping to established T2D loci: KRTAP4 3  (P152S; P,1.7x10  17; 0.3% MAF) and DOCK6 (R430H; P,6.2x10 8; 0.4% MAF). One additional  NS variant in PSORS1C1 approached significance (E34K; P,6.4 x 10 7, 9%  MAF). We found no evidence of LF or rare coding variants with large effects  (Odds ratio>1.5) in established T2D risk loci that could explain common SNP GWAS associations. Gene based analysis (SKAT o) of rare NS variants in four genes C16orf91 , IL22RA2 , FAM63A , and GSG2  met the gene based si  gnificance threshold (P< 5x10  6), but each is driven by association in a single  study and further confirmation is required.Our results indicate that the ge netic landscape of T2D susceptibility is not dominated by LF and rare coding variants of large effect.

Background: Personalised cancer medicine based on mutation profiling  of tumours is now reality in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer  (mCRC). KRAS mutations represents a predictive biomarker for resistance  to anti EGFR therapy. However, up to 65% of patients with KRAS wild type tumours do not respond to this therapy. This fact suggest that additional  markers (in the RAS RAF MAPK or PI3K AKT mTOR signaling pathways,  functional polymorphism in the binding site of microRNA) may also contri bute to resistance to anti EGFR therapy.Aim: Mutation profiling of selected mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA gene  and SNP (rs61764370) KRAS LCS6 in the binding site of let 7 microRNA to the 3Â´UTR region of KRAS gene.Method: In this study 503 DNA samples of tumours tissues of mCRC pa  tients were tested for presence of selected mutations of KRAS,BRAF and PIK3CA gene. Analysis was performed by PCR, reverse hybridisation, real time PCR and primer extension method. SNP (rs61764370) was analysed in 164 samples and was performed by PCR+RFLP method.Results: Activating mutations were detected in 40% (KRAS), 5,6% (BRAF)  and 9% (PIK3CA) of the tumours. Coexistence of mutations were detected in 4,8% (mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA gene) and 0,6% (BRAF and PIK3CA). T/G genotype of the SNP (rs61764370) was identified in 11% of 164 mCRC patients.Conclusion: Frequency of mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA is similar  to frequency reported by other authors, respectively. KRAS and BRAF mu tations were mutually exclusive. Additional predictive biomarkers may aid in the selection of mCRC patients which could profit from targeted cancer therapy.  J. Simova: None. B.

This fact suggest that additional  markers (in the RAS RAF MAPK or PI3K AKT mTOR signaling pathways,  functional polymorphism in the binding site of microRNA) may also contri bute to resistance to anti EGFR therapy.Aim: Mutation profiling of selected mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA gene  and SNP (rs61764370) KRAS LCS6 in the binding site of let 7 microRNA to the 3Â´UTR region of KRAS gene.Method: In this study 503 DNA samples of tumours tissues of mCRC pa  tients were tested for presence of selected mutations of KRAS,BRAF and PIK3CA gene. Analysis was performed by PCR, reverse hybridisation, real time PCR and primer extension method. SNP (rs61764370) was analysed in 164 samples and was performed by PCR+RFLP method.Results: Activating mutations were detected in 40% (KRAS), 5,6% (BRAF)  and 9% (PIK3CA) of the tumours. Coexistence of mutations were detected in 4,8% (mutations in KRAS and PIK3CA gene) and 0,6% (BRAF and PIK3CA). T/G genotype of the SNP (rs61764370) was identified in 11% of 164 mCRC patients.Conclusion: Frequency of mutations of KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA is similar  to frequency reported by other authors, respectively. KRAS and BRAF mu tations were mutually exclusive. Additional predictive biomarkers may aid in the selection of mCRC patients which could profit from targeted cancer therapy.  J. Simova: None. B.

1567,1138, Exome sequencing characterise the somatic mutation spectrum of early serrated lesions in a patient with BRAF negative hyperplastic polyposis syndrome,P11.151,,"Background. Hyperplastic polyposis syndrome (HPS) is a yet poorly defined colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition characterised by the occurrence of multiple and/or large serrated lesions throughout the colon. A serrated po lyp CRC sequence (serrated pathway) of CRC formation has been postulated, however, to date only few molecular signatures of serrated neoplasia (BRAF, KRAS mutations, CpG Island Methylation, MSI) were described in a subset of HPS patients and neither the etiology of the syndrome nor the distinct genetic alterations during tumorigenesis have been identified. Methods. To describe the mutational landscape of serrated polyps and the involved pathways we sequenced the exomes (Illumina HiSeq platform) of 11 early hyperplastic polyps without the BRAF V600E mutation obtained from a 41 year old female patient with clinically confirmed HPS. For data analysis the VARBANK pipeline was used. Somatic mutations were identified by compa rison with leukocyte DNA and are currently validated by Sanger sequencing. Results. We identified 25 unique rare somatic alterations of 25 different ge nes in the 11 serrated tumours. All variants are single basepair substituti   ons; all but two variants are present in one tumour only. The predominant mutation type are missense mutations (92%) caused by G>T transversions (75%). No known cancer genes are affected. Conclusions. Somatic mutati   ons seem to be rare events in early hyperplastic lesions of HPS patients wit   hout BRAF mutation. No frequently affected genes or enrichment of specific pathways have been observed. Thus, other alterations such as epigenetic changes might be the major driving force of tumour progression.  S.

1570,1155,The analysis of genetic alterations in the NSCLC patients using hybridization with diagnostic biochips,P11.169,,"N. Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center of Russian Academy  of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation. Specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (gefitinib and  erlotinib) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor (crizotinib)  are used for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Somatic  mutations in EGFR gene and key effectors along EGFR signaling pathway (KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA), as well as ALK rearrangements are associated with  sensitivity to these drugs. A biochip has been developed which allows detecting 13 mutations in 12, 13 and 61 codons of KRAS; 5 mutations in 858, 719, 790 codons and 13 dele tions in exon 19 of EGFR; V600E of BRAF; 5 mutations in 542, 545, 546 and  1047 codons of PIK3CA gene. The technique of LNA (locked nucleic acid)  clamp PCR was used to increase the sensitivity of the assay followed by alle   le specific hybridization of fluorescently labeled target on biochip. To deter   mine the ALK rearrangements a biochip analyzing 11 breakpoint variants of EML4 ALK translocations has been designed. The reverse transcription PCR with chimeric EML4 ALK mRNA was used prior to hybridization. To prove the feasibility of the method clinical samples from 84 unselected  patients with NSCLC were analyzed. We identified EGFR mutations in 13 (15%), KRAS mutations in 14 (17%), PIK3CA mutations in 8 (10%) and EML4 ALK translocations in 2 (2%) of patients. The data on mutation ana   lysis were verified by direct sequencing. We consider the biochip based ap proach to be simple and useful diagnostic tool for identification of NSCLC patients which will respond to target therapy.The work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grant #11 04 01950).

A deficiency of MUTYH function results in somatic G:C>T:A transver   sions that can be observed in APC  and KRAS genes. We report the case of a 33 year old woman with atypical MAP , diagnosed  via detection of the somatic KRAS c.34G>T mutation. The patient was admit  ted to our institution with stercoral peritonitis and liver nodules diagnosed initially as abscesses upon imagery. Further investigation revealed hepatic  metastasis of an occult colonic cancer. Given her young age, she was sent to  the Oncogenetics Unit even if family history was negative. The hypothesis of Lynch syndrome was excluded by the tumor phenotype (microsatellite stab   le phenotype and maintenance of expression of MMR proteins). Rather, the diagnosis of MAP was suspected on the basis of the presence of the somatic KRAS c.34G>T mutation in liver metastasis. MUTYH gene sequence analy   sis identified two germ line mutations: c.[494A>G];[1395_1397delGGA] (p.[Tyr165Cys];[Glu466del]) (refseq NM_001048171.1) confirming the dia gnosis of MAP . Twelve months later, total colectomy was finally performed, which showed the presence of an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon and  more than 30 adenomatous polyps. This case was interesting in view of the unusual presentation of MAP , with stercoral peritonitis revealing metastatic colon cancer in a 33 year old wo man.

1591,1357,Towards a Theory of Science Policy for Genetics,P14.30,,"Many politically charged topics in Western liberal democracies have science at their core: embryonic stem cell research, climate change, GM crops, or al   ternative energy strategies. But science has always been politically charged    from the early 17th century academies advising governments, to the Hori   zon 2020 budget debate in Europe and the âfiscal cliffâ in the United States. We argue that science has become especially challenging for policy making precisely because liberal democracies lack a coherent way to accommodate pluralistic views about scientific innovation. Indeed, given the importance of science in society, it is surprising that so little attention has been given to providing a coherent approach that would explain the way science poli cy works. Such an approach, if it could be developed as theory, might help systematize public decision making about science and more effectively con tribute to desirable social goals. Human genetics is only the most recent of many science policy topics where comprehensive ethical analysis has been brought to bear (rightly) on key issues such as informed consent, privacy, and governance. This may be why regulation of direct to consumer genetic testing, establishing consent protocols for biobanks, or constructing privacy protections for GWAS studies does not admit of harmonized policy. It may also be that insufficient effort has been made to articulate the fundamental political values that underpin progress in science policy. To supplement the role that ethical theory has played in genetics, we sketch the basic features of a theory of science policy using political philosophy to engage these nor   mative problems.   E.M.

The DNA was extracted using the prepITâ¢L2P kit, an alcohol precipitation based ex   traction kit that yields high quality, high molecular weight DNA. Library pre paration, sequencing and assembly were performed at Complete Genomics (CGI). Sequencing performance of DNA from saliva was compared against a publicly available trio data set sequenced from blood DNA, sequenced by CGI. There was no statistical difference between the number of known variants (p,0.064), novel variants (p,0.243), indels (p,0.069) and frames hifts (p,0.075) called among saliva samples compared to blood samples on average. In saliva, we observed minor differences in synonymous reference mismatch calls, missense variants and total sites called. These differences are likely due to differences in donors and sequencing coverage between the saliva and blood samples, work is ongoing to determine the cause.

1597,1400,An integrated âimputation in a boxâ pipeline for GWAS studies,P15.44,,"Genetic imputation has been a major component of many bioinformatics analysis pipelines including GWAS, signal refinement and meta analysis. Moreover, modern genomic research moves towards identification and dis   covery of novel markers that contribute to complex diseases. These markers often belong to the lower side of the frequency spectrum. In order to impute these sufficiently we need vast amounts of data both in the study and the reference panel. Hence imputation tend to be very laborious, complex and demand modern High Performance Computing (HPC) environments. Finally very limited work has been done to improve comparability, reproducibility and sharing of existing pipelines.Here we propose a web application that contains analysis pipelines for al   most all imputation software (mach/minimach, impute2 and beagle). The pipelines include protocols for format conversion, sample and chromosome chunking, quality check, accuracy metrics and visualization, all in simple CSV format and as editable elements in a database. It also includes the wide ly used reference panels of 1000 Genomes (GIANT release), HapMap2 and tools for creation of custom panels. The application supports various fla vours of HPCs including local server, (pbs) cluster, grid and cloud infrastruc ture. The complete computation can be monitored and managed through a web interface or commandline interface.The proposed approach can be conceptualized as an âimputation in a boxâ application that belongs to the family of MOLGENIS âcomputeâ ecosystem that also includes NGS and GWAS pipelines.

1604,1471, From GWAS to WGS: a whole genome association study in 250 trios of the Genome of the Netherlands Project.,P16.047,,"Introduction: The Genome of the Netherlands Project (GoNL) was set up to  characterize genomic variation in 250 pedigrees of Dutch ancestry. 231 trios  and 19 quartets were sequenced at medium depth of coverage (>12x) by BGI  (Shenzhen, China). We explored how this whole genome sequencing data set could be used for an association analysis with height, weight, body mass index  (BMI), and lipid traits (LDL C, HDL C, triglycerides, and total cholesterol). Methods: We included 748 samples in the association analysis and called 19,763,454 bi allelic SNPs. We excluded SNPs based on Hardy Weinberg equi librium (P < 1 x 10  6) and minor allele frequency < 1%, leaving 8,337,919 SNPs  for further analysis. We used FaST LMM to incorporate family structure in the  association testing. Results: No SNPs reached genome wide significance (P â¤ 5 x 10 8) for any trait.  There was no evidence of population stratification or inflated type 1 error rate. Testing loci previously associated with the traits studied, we observed a clear excess of significant associations with the expected direction of effect. We also tested various gene based tests, and explored how to correct effec tively for the correlated test statistics.Discussion: Power to test for association is limited with a small sample size. Nevertheless, we were able to replicate a bulk association signal for known loci of all phenotypes studied. We expect that the primary value of the GoNL whole genome sequencing panel will be for imputation in much larger samp les already genotyped in the GWAS era.  J. van Setten: None. S.L. Pulit: None.

In this case, a General regressive Model (GM), allowing to test for both additive effect and dominance deviation from additive effect, may be more appropri   ate for association tests.Aims: to compare the power of GM to other classical association tests under a large panel of models.Method: Powers were estimated by simulating 1 million replicates of 300 cases and 300 controls for 3 disease prevalence (1%, 5% and 10%), various SNP frequencies (between 0.1 and 0.5), various risk alleleâs genetic effect (Odds Ratio between 1.2 and 4) and different transmission modes (recessi   ve, dominant, additive). Four association tests: general, recessive, dominant ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 391Back to index and additive models were applied to all replicates to estimate their respecti  ve powers to detect association. Results: Although GM has one supplementary degree of freedom, its power  to detect association is close to the power obtained by analysis under the true (simulated) model. Furthermore, GM is much more powerful than the  additive model when the true genetic model is recessive. The test on domi   nance deviation parameter was able to estimate the correct model in more  than 95% of replicates.Conclusion: We recommended applying GM model instead of the additive  model for GWAS.

1612,1490, Association study of TOLL and CARD with leprosy susceptibility in Chinese population,P16.066,,"Background: Previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified  multiple susceptibility loci that have highlighted the important role of TLR  (Toll like Receptor) and CARD (caspase recruitment domain) genes in le  prosy.Methods: A large three stage candidate gene based association study of 69   TLR and CARD  genes was performed in the leprosy samples of Chinese Han. Results: Of 4,363 SNPs investigated, eight SNPs showed suggestive asso   ciation (P<0.01) in our previously published GWAS datasets (Stage 1). Of the eight SNPs, rs2735591 and rs4889841 showed significant association  (P<0.001) in an independent series of 1,504 cases and 1,502 controls (Sta   ge II), but only rs2735591 (next to BCL10) showed significant association  in the second independent series of 938 cases and 5,827 controls (Sta   ge III). Rs2735591 showed consistent association across the three stages  (P>0.05 for heterogeneity test), significant association in the combined va lidation samples (P corrected,5.54Ã10 4 after correction for 4,363 SNPs tested),  and genome wide significance in the whole GWAS and validation samples (P,1.03Ã10  9, OR,1.24). In addition, we demonstrated the lower expression  of BCL10 in leprosy lesions than normal skins and the formation of a highly  significant gene network by BCL10 and the eight previously identified genes  (P,1Ã10 19) that regulates the activity of NFÎºB, a major regulator of down  stream inflammatory responses, which provides further biological evidence for the association.Conclusion: We have discovered a novel susceptibility locus on 1p22, which implicates BCL10 as a new susceptibility gene for leprosy.

1621,1526,Rare Variant Extensions of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test Detects Associations with Autism Exome Sequence Data,P16.106,,"Many population based rare variant association tests have been developed to analyze sequence data. A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise   quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa   tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7  gene. Given  the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

1622,1533, Contribution of rs7756992 of CDKAL1 and rs4402960 of IGF2BP2 to the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Tunisian population.,P16.113,,"Aims: The insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2)  and the cyckin dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit associated protein  1 like 1 (CDKAL1) identified through GWAS studies have been shown to be  associated with type 2 diabetes in various ethnic groups. The study aim was to investigate the association of the rs7756992 of CDKAL1 and rs4402960  of IGF2BP2 with T2D and diabetic complications (nephropathy and retino  pathy). Methods: We performed a case control association study including 200 T2DM Tunisian patients (WHO criteria) with diabetic nephropathy (33%), diabetic retinopathy (41.5%) and 208 controls (age â¥40; fasting plasma glu   cose <6.1 mmol/l; without first degree family history of diabetes). Geno   typing was performed using TaqMan technology. Statistical analyses were carried out using Stata 11 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).Results: We found a significant association between the rs4402960 of IGF2BP2 and T2DM (p < 10 4). Furthermore, the rs7756992 of CDKAL1 was  associated with the reduced risk of diabetic nephropathy in patients with  diabetes (p , 0.001).

1648,1855,2q13.3 deletion syndrome in a newborn with ring chromosome 22 presenting with congenital hypotonia,J02.472,,"The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome or Phelan McDermid syndrome is characte rized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, absent to severely delayed speech, normal to accelerated growth with minor dismorphic fea tures such as dolichocephaly, large or unusual ears, long eye lashes, bulbous  nose, pointed chin, large hands and dysplastic toe nails. Most individuals  have moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic like beha viour and decreased pain perception. Frequency of the syndrome is equal in males and females while incidence is still unknown. Beside the simple de   letion, loss of 22q13.3 can also result from translocation, ring chromosome formation and other less common structural changes affecting the region containing SHANK3 gene on long arm of chromosome 22. The most features  of the syndrome thought to be the consequence of loss that specific gene. We present a case of female newborn with Phelan McDermid syndrome. The child was born on term, from first, uncomplicated pregnancy with un  remarkable family history. She was initially treated in NICU because of early  neonatal infection. Because of congenital hypotonia with mild facial dysmor   phic features genetic analysis were performed. The karyotype revealed ring  chromosome (22): 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13.3). A fluorescent in situ hybridisa   tion analysis was performed, indicating that the deletion encompassed the  critical 22q13.3 region. After good clinical evaluation, congenital hypotonia especially with dysmorphic features may be the only indication for genetic  evaluation, so we suggest importance of genetic review in cases like this.

1657,1940,Replicative association analysis of schizophrenia in Kazakh population,J06.10,,"Ethnic background is an important factor in personalized health care and  predictive medicine directed to prevention of common diseases. Common  psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia are the sub  ject of intensive genetic research based on genome wide association studies (GWAS) and targeted resequencing of genomic regions of interest. Genetic  variants associated with cognitive impairments, which are an important  endophenotypes for schizophrenia, also have been revealed by GWAS. The  aim of this study was to replicate the GWAS findings in European and Chi   nese populations in ethnic populations of Kazakhs. Kazakhs, the Mongoloid Turkic speaking population, represent the major ethnic group of Republic  of Kazakhstan and also a significant ethnic minority in neighboring Russia,  Uzbekistan, Mongolia and China. 15 SNPs strongly associated with schizophrenia and cognitive performance according to recent GWA studies were genotyped by real time PCR in Kaz   akh patients with paranoid schizophrenia and in healthy control group (N,  302). The association of rs2312147 located in the region of vaccinia related  kinase 2 (VRK2) gene, previously reported in GWAS by Stefansson et al.  (2009), was confirmed in Kazakhs (OR , 1.72, p , 0.008). Rs2247572 loca ted in the vicinity of KCNB2 (potassium voltage gated channel) gene found in genome wide association with cognitive performance traits (Need et al,  2009) was also associated with schizophrenia in Kazakhs (OR , 1.64, p ,  0.016). Association of genetic markers in loci for TLR4, SLCO6A1, NOTCH4, TCF4, ZNF804A, AGBL1, RELN, ZFP64P1, CSMD1, CPVL, NRG and NRIP1 was not replicated in Kazakh population.

1662,1972,"Polymorphisms in CLU, CR1 , ACE and catD genes and Alzheimerâs disease: a case control study in Brazil",J08.09,,"Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified many genes re lated with increased risk to Alzheimerâs disease (AD). The ApoE e4 allele ,  a known risk factor for the disease, as well as, variants in CLU (8p21.1) and  CR1 (1q32) genes encoding, respectively, clusterin and complement recep  tor 1, were reported in these studies. Moreover, variants in genes enco ding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, 17q23) and cathepsin D (catD,  11p15.5) were also suggested to be involved with risk to AD. In the Brazilian population ApoE e4 allele showed positive association with the disease. In order to research genetic variations causing susceptibility for AD in Brazil we investigated polymorphisms in CLU (rs11136000), CR1 (rs6701713),  ACE (I/D) and catD (rs17571) genes through PCR FRLP in samples from  VitÃ³ria (Southeast region). A total of 243 individuals were selected through clinical parameters, including 81 patients and 162 controls matched by gender, age and ethnicity. We found no statistic differences in allelic and ge notypic frequencies between the groups (p>0.05), even after stratification by ApoE e4 status. The lack of significance in CLU and CR1 genes could be  due to the small sample size, since these variations only showed association with AD in GWAS studies that analysed thousand of individuals. On the other hand, variations in ACE and catD  genes, even using small samples, showed  controversy results between distinct populations. These results revealed the necessity of validation of genetic variations for the risk of AD among populations with distinct ethnic profile. Supported by FAPES, FACITEC and MCTI/CNPQ/MEC/CAPES.  L.

A very complex and longlasting process, closely related to interaction  of external and genetic factors, contributes to development of this malignant disease. Activation of the KRAS oncogene is of importance in colorectal car  cinogenesis. Methods: Surgically resected colorectal cancer tissue, embedded in paraffin sections, was used for molecular analysis of the KRAS gene. DNA isolation is performed using cobasÂ® DNA Sample Preparation Kit. The status of the  KRAS gene is determined by real time polymerase chain reaction method    Real Time PCR (cobasÂ® 4800 System) with cobasÂ® KRAS Mutation Test CE IVD which is used for detection of somatic mutations of the KRAS gene. Result: Out of the total of 40 analyzed colorectal cancer tissue samples, point  mutation on codons 12, 13 or 61 was detected in 18 samples (45%).

Reports from several independent GWAS studies and other sources showed that some polymorphisms close to IL28B gene were strongly associated to therapeutic response to interfe ron based treatment, and also with spontaneous clearance of HCV. These studies indicated a strong correlation between genotypes of polymorphis   ms RS12979860 and RS8099917 and the outcome of the treatment with interferon in patients infected with genotypes 1 and 4 of HCV. This asso   ciation was not clear with patients infected with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 due to discrepant results from different studies, although study performed with an Italian sample infected with these genotypes showed an association bet   ween polymorphism RS12979860 and therapeutic response of patients that do not achieve a rapid virologic response (no RVR). In Brazil, the genotype 3 is the second most prevalent HCV genotype with about 25 30% of reported cases. In order to verify the influence of the IL28B polymorphisms in this highly admixed population, a meta analysis of 5 independent cohorts was conducted aiming to associate treatment outcome and the polymorphisms RS12979860 e RS8099917 genotypes. The results clearly indicated that both SNPs are associated with response, but the RS8099917 (effect Ï21,14.6; he terogeneity Ï24,1.32) showed a stronger association, indicating that it is a more reliable marker for HCV3 IFN therapy.

1687,2229,Microarray Comparative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients with autism or autistic spectrum disorders,J18.03,,"Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, Athens, Greece. Aim: Autism or autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are a lifelong neurode   velopmental disorder and Î± few cases of chromosomal abnormalities are  found by conventional cytogenetic techniques, while the microarray Compa  rative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) allows the identification of submicroscopic genomic rearrangements. This study describes the ap  plication of array CGH, as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients  with autism or ASD. Materials  Methods: During the last 4 years, 88/480 patients were studied with autism or ASD of unknown aetiology but with normal previous con ventional karyotype and other genetic tests. High resolution 4X180K and  1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro  bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar  dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51). CNVs  detected were in loci at high risk for autism: 2q37.2, 2p16.3, 5p15.32p14.3,  7p22.3, 10q26.3, 12q24.22q24.3, 15q11.2q11.3, 16p11.2, 18q22.3q23, 21q22.3, Î§q21.31. Genes associated with autism or ASD which were identi fied included: NRXN1, SHANK3, DOCK8, ZNF92, ASMT , HSFX1, KCNH7, CHR   FAM7A, CHRNA7, KCND2, CNTNAP3, ÎÎÎÎ, MAOB, STS, VCX.

1687,2229,Microarray Comparative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients with autism or autistic spectrum disorders,J18.03,,"Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, Athens, Greece. Aim: Autism or autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are a lifelong neurode   velopmental disorder and Î± few cases of chromosomal abnormalities are  found by conventional cytogenetic techniques, while the microarray Compa  rative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) allows the identification of submicroscopic genomic rearrangements. This study describes the ap  plication of array CGH, as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients  with autism or ASD. Materials  Methods: During the last 4 years, 88/480 patients were studied with autism or ASD of unknown aetiology but with normal previous con ventional karyotype and other genetic tests. High resolution 4X180K and  1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro  bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar  dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51). CNVs  detected were in loci at high risk for autism: 2q37.2, 2p16.3, 5p15.32p14.3,  7p22.3, 10q26.3, 12q24.22q24.3, 15q11.2q11.3, 16p11.2, 18q22.3q23, 21q22.3, Î§q21.31.

In order to determine the origin of sSMCs, we used a variety of FISH methods with different DNA probes as well as multicolor FISH tech   niques (mFISH, mBAND, cen mFISH). A total of 12 sSMCs (28,6%) originated from chromosome 15: inv dup(15)(q11.1) markers were detected in 9 cases (1 mosaic) with normal phenotype; inv dup(15)(q13) sSMCs , contained PWS/AS critical regionâ in 3 cases with abnormal phenotype. sSMCs derived from chromosome 22 were detected in 13 cases (31%): inv dup(22)(q11.1) markers were detected in 8 cases (2 mosaic) with normal phenotype; inv dup(22)(q11.2) â in 3 cases (2 mosaic) (cat eye syndrome); der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) â in 1 case (Emanuel syndrome); inv dup (22)(:p11.1âqter)â  in 1 case. sSMC originating from chromosome 21   inv dup(21)(q11.1) was  detected in one case. sSMCs as the product of 3:1 segregation of a reciprocal translocation were characterized in 2 cases. sSMCs associated with Palli   ster Killian syndrome were detected in 3cases, with i(18)(p10) syndrome â in 4 cases. Small marker ring chromosomes were identified in 3 cases: one case   r(20) and two cases   r(16). Neocentromere  sSMCs were revealed in  2 cases: unbalanced inv dup(8)(p23) and balanced r(1)(p13p21).

1692,2361,In silico personal omics profiling on the basis of whole genome array CGH analysis uncovers disease pathways,J20.20,,"Regardless of significant efforts made towards definition of personified di sease pathways in clinical populations using whole genome array CGH ana   lysis, there is still a need for developing new tools to process whole genome scan data for definition of causative genome variations. To succeed, we have proposed an original bioinformatic strategy of CNV/gene prioritization by rating data acquired from clinical, cytogenetic and genomic variation da tabases and by means of bioinformatic tools for genome, epigenome and pathway analysis. To test the strategy, we have evaluated the Russian co hort of children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and congeni tal anomalies (116 individuals; partially described in Iourov I.Y. et al. Mol. Cytogenet. 2012; 5:46.). Causative CNVs were deletions of 1q42.13, 2q31.1, 2q35, 2q37.3, 3p22.1, 3p11.1, 7q31.1, 9q34.3, 10q21.3, 13q32.2, 17q25.3, 19p12, 20p12.2, Xq12 and duplications of 2q24.1, 7p14.3, 10p13, 12p13.31, 16p13.3, 19p13.3, 19q13.2, Xp22.12. Accordingly, alterations to such pa thways as apoptosis, axon guidance, brain (fetal) development, transcrip tional regulation, cell cycle regulation, Fanconi anemia, histone acetylation, mitotic checkpoint, o glycan biosynthesis, p53 pathway, V(D)J recombina tion as well as calcium, carbohydrates and zinc metabolism or transport were found to be associated with phenotypic outcome. Moreover, we have determined a Y chromosome locus associated with autism and intellectual disability. Our results demonstrate that a bioinformatic strategy encompas sing all the âomicsâ approaches, which are performed in silico on the basis of data obtained by whole genome array CGH analysis, is a valuable tool for uncovering disease pathways in personalized genomic medicine.Supported by the President of the Russian Federation Grant MD 4401.2013.7  S.G.

We previously showed that increased dosage of methyl CpG binding prote  in 2 (MeCP2) leads to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder in males, desi   gnated as the MECP2 duplication syndrome (MIM#300260). The increased  dosage of MeCP2 is the result of a copy number gain at Xq28, including the MECP2 gene and results in severe to profound neurodevelopmental delay  with onset at birth, limited or absent speech, hypotonia, epilepsy, autistic  behavior and motor dysfunction. We developed induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome carrying different  duplication sizes, to study the impact of increased MePC2 dosage in human  neurons. Differentiation of these iPSCs into neurons of cortical identity sho   wed modulation in the expression of progenitor genes like BLBP and FOXG1  and cortical genes like RELN, CTIP2, TBR1  and VGLUT. Cortical neurons  derived from Mecp2dup iPSCs had more synapses, and altered network  synchronization as well as dendritic complexity. Next, we tested a series of epigenetic drugs for the ability to rescue neuronal defects and validated two HDAC inhibitors as potential clinical candidates. Our model recapitulates  early stages of the human MECP2 duplication syndrome and represents a  promising cellular tool to facilitate therapeutic drug screening for severe  neurodevelopmental disorders .",2014.0,,"S.

1703,111, Genetic studies of mosaic birth defects affecting the skin by next generation DNA sequencing,C05.2,,"A large group of sporadic developmental disorders involving the skin are  or may be caused by postzygotic mutational events. Although mosaic birth defects traditionally rank among the most complex forms of monogenic di seases for gene discovery studies due to the challenges of detecting mutati   ons present in only a fraction of cells, exome sequencing recently emerged  as a powerful tool in the context of postzygotic mosaicism. In recent years,  we and others have identified mutations of PIK3CA and other PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway genes in several mosaic overgrowth syndromes including megalencephaly capillary malformation, hemimegalencephaly, fibroadipo   se hyperplasia, Proteus, CLOVES, and Klippel Trenaunay syndromes. So  matic HRAS and KRAS mutations were reported in isolated and syndromic  sebaceous nevi, and GNAQ mutations were associated with Sturge Weber syndrome and port wine stains. To further study the genetic basis of mosaic birth defects involving the skin, we ascertained and collected blood and skin  specimens from > 100 unrelated individuals with patterns of skin lesions  suggestive of cutaneous mosaicism. Systematic targeted deep sequencing of  known causative genes on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina) in subjects with a clinical presentation consistent with the aforementioned syndromes resul ted in a diagnostic yield over 50% and led to identification of variants with  allelic fractions as low as 1%. Exome sequencing studies based on paired  samples or trios in subjects with a clinical presentation of unknown genetic  cause led to identification of two new genes underlying two mosaic skin pig mentation syndromes.

Our study fo  cused on the analysis of SHANK2  variants associated with schizophrenia. We  analyzed all exons and exon intron boundaries of the ProSAP1A_AB208026 isoform of SHANK2  by Sanger sequencing in a cohort of 481 schizophrenia  patients (177 trios and 304 singleton patients) and 374 unaffected indivi duals. We detected ten missense variants that affect protein structure which are only present in the patient group.We used mutation prediction tools that are based on evolutionary protein conservation and chemical properties of amino acids to select the four most promising variants. In silico investigation is helpful to estimate a functional  relevance of mutations, but cannot substitute the functional analysis itself. To analyze the functional impact of the four selected mutations, we conduc ted overexpression and knockdown rescue experiments in primary hippo campal neurons from rat with a major focus on morphological changes of the neurons. Another major point of our study was to investigate the effect of different SHANK2 isoforms and schizophrenia mutations on the actin  structures. We used COS 7 cells as a model system and live cell TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy for imaging of actin structu res. Additionally, we also performed actin polymerization assays to measu re in vivo F actin/G actin ratio in our mutants compared to SHANK2 wild  type.

As part of the UK10K study, we have investigated the genetic architecture of anthropometric traits in 3,538 individuals with 6.5x whole genome sequence (WGS) data from the ALSPAC and TwinsUK cohorts. Variants discovered through WGS, along with those from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP), were imputed into additional individuals from the ALSPAC and TwinsUK cohorts with GWAS data (total sample size 9,979). We investigated association between anthropometric traits and 8.6 million low frequency and common variants (MAF>0.01). We are in the process of obtai   ning in silico replication of prioritised signals. In interim replication analysis  across ~15,000 samples, 43 out of 66 novel signals for BMI have the same direction of effect in the replication cohorts (p value,0.0093). We examined the concordance of the direction of effect at established loci for each trait. Out of the 31 established independent loci for BMI that were present in our data, 28 have the same direction of effect (p value,2.3e 06). For weight, 10 out of 11 known loci (p value,0.006), and for height 151 out of 172 loci (p value<2.2e 16) have the same direction of effect, respectively. We estimated the improvement in genome wide signal captured relative to those present  in HapMap 2, HapMap 3 or 1KGP .

Comprehensive DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) mapping by the ENCO  DE project identified all classes of cis regulatory elements. Recent studies  showed enrichment of complex trait GWAS noncoding hits in DHS. However,  GWAS hits only partially explain complex trait heritability. The discovery of rare variants located in regulatory regions specific to immune cells should  explain part of this heritability. Our approach combines selective DNA cap  ture of relevant regulatory regions coupled to next generation sequencing. Genome wide DHS mapping data from the ENCODE and NIH Roadmap Epi genomics Projects were used to select regulatory regions of immune cells.  We designed a custom DNA capture panel (Roche SeqCap EZ developer)  to target these selected regions, as well as exonic and HLA regions. Captu   red DNA (163Mb) is indexed (5 fold per lane) for sequencing on Illumina  HiSeq2000 system, yielding average coverage of ~28x.

The  capture panel was also applied to 150 trios from the SaguenayÃ¢ÂÂLac Saint Jean asthma familial collection (complex trait with immune and inflamm atory components). We observe an enrichment of variants in the vicinity  of allelicly differentially expressed genes (p<1e 10) as well as potential  impact of rare conserved variants on allelic differential expression of ge nes (p<0.05).

1717,192, Efficient molecular diagnosis of Intellectual Disability: targeted High throughput exon sequencing of 217 ID genes detects causative mutations in at least 26 of 106 tested patients,C18.2,,"Intellectual disability is a major public health problem, characterized by an extreme genetic heterogeneity, with several hundred genes implicated in monogenic forms with or without autism, complicating molecular dia gnosis. In patients without evocative syndromic forms the offer is limited to Fragile X testing and array CGH, leaving most cases undiagnosed. Trio Exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, but re mains costly for general implementation. We thus tested targeted exon se   quencing of 217 genes previously implicated in X linked ID, or in autosomal dominant or recessive forms in which ID is the major clinical concern. We analyzed 106 patients (mostly males and sporadic cases) with molecularly undiagnosed ID. One third of them harbored autistic features.We identified causative mutations in 26 patients: sixteen in X linked ge nes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD , FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1 , IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA,  MECP2, SLC9A6 , SLC16A2, PHF8), 10 de novo in autosomal genes (DYRK1A ,  GRIN1 , MED13L , TCF4, RAI1 , SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 ). We detected likely  causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3  for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge  nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit  more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions.  The identification of mutations in 25 29% of patients proves the diagnostic efficiency of this strategy, higher than CGH and comparable to trio exome sequencing at lesser cost.

The lack of knowledge on the molecular basis of Normal Hearing Function (NHF) and Age related Hearing Loss (ARHL), prompted us to develop a  combined multiphase strategy using approx. 3000 individuals from isolated  populations of Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia. Starting from our past experience on GWAS meta analysis combined with expression studies (Gi   rotto et al. 2014), the following strategy was designed: PHASE1: GWAS me ta analysis for common tag SNPs and common functional variants, PHASE2: replication in independent cohorts, PHASE3: SKAT gene based test for rare functional variants, PHASE4: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) in a selected  subgroup of 250 ARHL cases/controls. During PHASE1 the following stron  gly significant associations were identified: ITFG2 (p,6.92E 11), PCDH20 (p,4.71E 10), SLC28A3 (p,2.39E 09). The last two belong to gene families  already known as being involved in hearing loss and expressed in the coch   lea. During PHASE2 four SNPs within the PCDH20 gene were replicated at  nominal level (p<0.05) in the 1958 British Birth Cohort. Applying PHASE3,  the SKAT gene based test for rare functional variants (0.001<MAF<0.05)  revealed highly suggestive associations (ranging from 7.97E 06 to 1.90E 05) for the following genes: PTPRCAP , FN1, EAF1, METRNL, PDP2, ARRDC1, HDGF, TMOD1.Finally, thanks to PHASE4 (carried out in collaboration with CRG, Spain), WES data are now available to identify population disease specific rare variants. In vitro and in vivo functional studies will be carried out in the future to confirm the role of the whole list of genes/variants identified through the above described phases.

1759,685, S Intellectual disability and autistic behavior due to de novo microduplication of Xq28 involving part of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. Is this a plausible explanation?,P08.09,,", Bari, Italy,  4Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ  di Milano, Bari, Italy,  5Servizio di Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore,, Roma, Italy, 6Istituto  di Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Saro Cuore, Roma, Italy, 7Istituto di  Anatomia Umana e Biologia Cellulare, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy. FRAXE is an X linked form of intellectual disability characterized by mild  to moderate cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic  behavior. The folate sensitive fragile site FRAXE is located in Xq28 appro  ximately 600 kb distal to the fragile X syndrome fragile site (FRAXA) and harbors an unstable GCC triplet repeat adjacent to a CpG island in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR  (untranslated region) of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. The disorder results from  amplification and methylation of the GCC repeats and consequence silen cing of AFF2. Although chromosome abnormalities (mostly deletions) that disrupt AFF2 have been reported with mild moderate intellectual disability,  microduplication of Xq28 that partially involved AFF2 has not been descri   bed as a potential cause of FRAXE. We performed clinical and molecular cha  racterization of patient with 301 kb interstitial de novo duplication at Xq28 (chrX:147ÃÂ490ÃÂ437 147ÃÂ791ÃÂ737bp)(GRCh37/hg19). This genomic mutati   on leads to the duplication of part of 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR region of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene which could be inactivated due to this genomic change. Namely, duplication of this segment potentially could have the same effects as amplification and  methylation of an unstable GCC triplet repeats. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are perfor   ming experiments aimed to study genic expression/metilation. As our pati   ent had cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity and mild dysmor   phism, we predict that partial duplication of AFF2 in our patient could be  the cause of his phenotype.",2014.0,,"N.

1771,733, M NPAS3 related copy number variants: a role in developmental delay?,P08.56,,"Neuronal PAS domain containing protein 3 (NPAS3) is a transcription factor expressed primarily in developing and adult brain tissues. Current evidence  suggests it is involved in neuronal development and maturation, and it has  recently been highlighted as potentially playing a key role in the evolution of the human brain. Clinically, NPAS3 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and numerous studies have supported this association. In addition, several cases of learning disabilities in patients with disruptions of this gene are reported, but this association remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present four unrelated individuals with small copy number vari ants (CNVs) within NPAS3: two intragenic duplications and two intragenic deletions. These CNVs range between 111 460kb in length and encompass  exonic sequences within the NPAS3 gene. All four patients had variable de   grees of developmental delay, and three had subtle distinctive facial features.  Two patients also had macrosomia and macrocephaly, while the other two had autistic features and behaviour issues, including psychosis in one indivi dual. In contrast, CNVs involving exonic sequences in NPAS3 have only been seen in one of over 19,000 controls. In summary, these four cases support an association between NPAS3 and developmental delay. This association is compatible with this geneÃ¢ÂÂs postulated effects on neuronal development, and suggests that abnormal function of NPAS3 may be implicated in other cases of non specific cognitive impairment.",2014.0,,"L.

1784,780, S Genetic evidence that hyperactive Th2 and NK immune pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder,P09.023,,"Converging evidence suggests that abnormal immunity is involved in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) both in children and  adults. Altered immune processes include ongoing neuroinflammation in  post mortem brains, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal  fluid and blood, altered immune cell function, presence of brain specific  auto antibodies, and dysregulated immune transcriptome. One strategy to  assess whether dysimmunity contributes to ASD pathogenesis or represents  a collateral by standing effect is to investigate whether functional SNPs  known to influence immune gene expression or function are associated with  ASD. We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro  band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in  all major immune pathways. Statistically significant opposite transmission  patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression  and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite  alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi  nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG)  activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autistic disorder in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014.0,,"I.

The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain.Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi   dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion.In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription. In conclusion, rare sequence variants in CHRNA7 do not significantly contribute to ASD susceptibility, at least in our clinical sample characterized by low frequency of associated medical comorbidity. This study represents the first sequence variant analysis of the CHRNA7 gene in a sample of idiopathic autism.",2014.0,,"E. Bacchelli1, A. Battaglia2, C. Cameli1, S. Lomartire1, S. Thomson3, J. S.

1794,834, M MEF2C haploinsufficiency is a recurrent finding in patients with autism spectrum disorders,P09.078,,"Since the first description of MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome in 2009, 42 patients have been reported either with deletion or point mutation of this gene. Intellectual disability (ID) is the core disorder of this syndrome but autistic features such as stereotypic movements and lack of social com munications are commonly reported. To further assess the role of MEF2C in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we looked for MEF2C point mutations by Sanger sequencing and for MEF2C copy number variations by SNP array in a cohort of 195 patients with ASD and mild to severe ID.We identified a de novo frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon in 2 siblings with ASD and severe ID. A maternal germinal mosaicism was confirmed based on the haplotype. A de novo MEF2C deletion was also found in a patient with ASD and a mild ID. In this study, we observed MEF2C haploinsufficiency in 1,5% (95% confidence interval: 0 3.2%) of patients with ASD. This is the first study to look specifically at MEF2C in ASD. Of note, a mutation in MEF2C was also found once by whole exome sequencing in another cohort of 175 trios with ASD. According to this notable MEF2C ha ploinsufficiency frequency in ASD, we strongly recommend to pay specific attention to this gene when performing non targeted genetic screening in ASD with a comorbid ID even for patients without severe ID.",2014.0,,"A.

Surgery and Translational  Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. Autism is a genetic disorder, with an estimated heritability greater than  90%. Over the past years, the convergence of genomic technologies has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci by means of linkage stu dies. Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. Recently, a role of potassium inward rectifying channels in the pathogenesis of autism disease has been postu lated due to the identification in patients affected by autism and epilepsy of two mutations in the KCNJ10 gene. The gene encodes the Kir4.1 channel which is expressed in astrocytes and neurons.We then searched for mutati   on in the KNCJ10 gene, as well as in two genes (KCNJ2 and KCNJ16) coding for additional Kir channels with reported expression in astrocytes and neu rons, in two unrelated patients. We detected a new mutation in the KCNJ2 gene in a boy affected by autism. The mutation has been detected also in the healthy father and in the paternal grandmother who reported a case of SIDS (Sudden Infant death Syndrome) in her family.

Recently de novo heterozygous truncating mutations in KAT6B have been identified in SBBYSS, and independently also in GPS.KAT6B encodes lysine acetyltransferase 6B, a part of histone H3 acetyltrans ferase complex. KAT6B is highly conserved and expressed in adult neural stem cells. Most mutations are in exon 18 encoding the acidic (A) and tran scriptional activation (TA) domains of KAT6B. Genotype phenotype correla   tion showed that patients with mutations in the 5ÃÂ´ region of exon 18 leading to loss of both domains suffer from GPS, while patients with mutations in the 3ÃÂ´ region leading to loss of the TA domain suffer from SBBYSS.We present an 8 year old girl with intellectual disability, autism and multip   le developmental anomalies. She has corpus callosum agenesis, flexion con tractures, hypoplastic patella, renal cysts and tracheomalacia (symptoms frequent in GPS but rare in SBBYSS), as well as blepharophimosis, lacrimal ducts stenosis, long toes, hypotonia and normal head circumference (fre quent in SYBBYSS but rare in GPS) and atrial septal defect, feeding difficul   ties and bulbous nose (common to both syndromes).Karyotyping and aCGH analysis of the patient yielded normal results.

The boy was referred for global intellectual disabili ty with very limited speech capabilities and autistic traits. The pregnancy had been uneventful except for an emergency Cesarean section because of breech position. Birth measurements were normal, however, the baby was hypotonic and exhibited difficulties in feeding. At physical examination at the age of 2ÃÂ½ years measurements were still normal but we noted discrete dysmorphic features: long eye lashes, broad mouth with cupid bow lips, small fingers with broad short endphalanges, clinodactyly of toes V on both sides, tender translucent skin, fine hair and cryptorchidism on the right side. On the MRI at the age of 2 years delayed myelinisation was visible. As the atresia of the external auditory canal is typical for a deletion 18q we performed a karyotype on lymphocytes which was first reported with no pathological findings.The array (2.7 Affymetrix SNP oligo array platform) analysis revealed a de   letion in mosaic form of 20.7 Mb of the long arm of chromosome 18, encom passing 69 genes in total. The mosaic was confirmed with FISH, which also revealed that the mosaic ratio in this case was 13% in cultivated blood and 81% in buccal swab.

1830,1050, S Unusual RASopathy due to a novel and severe mutation in the NF1 gene.,P11.101,,"We report a Caucasian man first seen at age of 25 months, referred with the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy due to prematurity. Furthermore, he presented severe developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, failure to thrive, dysplasia of the right optic nerve, and pulmonic stenosis. We also found dolichocepha   ly, open fontanel, hypertelorism, large ears with posterior pits, wide neck, mild pectus excavatum, short 4th metacarpals, and minor ridge dysplasia and radial loops in the indexes and right 3rd finger. Chromosomes and meta bolic tests were normal. Because features of a RASopathy, sequence analysis of the PTPN11, RAF1, SOS1 and KRAS genes was performed, but no muta   tions were found. At age 21, his older sister was diagnosed with plexiform neurofibromas, requiring amputation of a leg. CT scan of the proband after accident unexpectedly showed massive plexiform neurofibromas infiltrating the spine, pelvis and extremities. Molecular testing showed an NF1 mutati   on, c.2326 6T>G, resulting in in frame skipping of exon 20 (r.2326_2409del), therefore expected to result in a protein lacking 28 amino acids from within the Cystein Serine Rich Domain (CSRD) (p.Trp777_Ala804del). This is a Ã¢ÂÂprivateÃ¢ÂÂ mutation, not previously reported and observed in 1/6,500 NF1 positive unrelated patients (UAB cohort). This was also found in his sister and father who both developed spinal neurofibromas but no classic skin findings (cutaneous neurofibromas, CALMs, freckling). This family illustra tes the importance of molecular confirmation in patients with minimal or no pigmentary manifestations and with features of other RASopathies.

We performed a prospective national case control study based on highly selected patients (CRC in two first degree relatives,  one being diagnosed before 61 years; or  CRC before 51 years; or multiple  primary CRCs, the first before 61 years; exclusion of Lynch syndrome, ade  nomatous and hamartomatous polyposes), and appropriate controls corre sponding to healthy volunteers, between 45 and 60 years of age, without  personal or familial history of CRC. We included 1029 patients and 350 con  trols. We confirmed the association of CRC risk with 4 SNPs, with odds ratio (OR) higher than previously reported : rs16892766  on 8q23.3 (OR: 1.89;  p,0.0006); rs4779584  on 15q13.3 (OR: 1.45; p,0.0033), and rs4939827   and rs58920878/Novel 1 on 18q21.1 (OR: 1.49; p,0.0061 and OR: 1.48;  p,0,0039). We found a significant cumulative effect of the at risk alleles or  genotypes with OR at 1.62, 2.11, 2.92 and 3.95 for 1, 2, 3 and at least 4 at risk  alleles and OR at 1.71, 2.32 and 6.31 for 1, 2 and 3 at risk genotypes.

The GENCODE geneset represents the reference human gene annotation for the ENCODE project and is produced by merging manual annotation and automated En sembl gene predictions with extensive computational and experimental QC and validation. Using different reference genesets will inevitably give diver   gent results and the absence, truncation or misannotation of a gene, exon, or alternatively spliced (AS) transcript may hinder analysis. We will highlight some significant differences between the GENCODE and NCBI Reference Se quence Database (RefSeq) genesets.

The platform of choice to  detect genome wide CNVs has traditionally been microarray (including SNP  arrays that can also detect copy neutral LOH regions); however, since samp  les have often undergone sequencing to discover pathogenic sequence vari  ants, it is desirable to exploit these data to also detect CNVs.

It is therefore of great importance to identify the genetic variation of the native Mexican population. In this study, 319 individuals from four indigenous po pulations (174, 70, 25 and 50 from Nahua, Maya, Totonac and Zapotec, re spectively) were included. Genotyping was performed using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarray. The analysis included a local ancestry estimation to remove segments infered to be of European origin and mixed linear models using EMMAX, adjusted for age, gender and two principal components. Two steps of quality control were performed, before and after the European segments were removed. Log transformed values of tryglecides (TG), total choleste rol (TC) and HDL cholesterol (HDL) were analyzed. By removing segments of European origin in the analysis we identify three suggestive signals, one for each trait.

1894,1527, MSelecting significant SNPs in Genome wide Association Studies using a global False Discovery Rate,P17.32,,"Standard methods for assessing significance in Genome wide Association  Studies (GWAS) are generally too stringent as they are based on controlling  the Family Wise Error Rate. The FDR (False Discovery Rate) approach provi  des a more realistic and less stringent alternative. However, controlling the FDR for correlated entities is difficult without making specific assumptions  on the correlation structure that may not be realistic. In this study, we define  an FDR like criterion (global FDR) for assessing statistical significance of SNPs in GWAS accounting for correlation (Linkage Disequilibrium) between neighboring SNPs. The criterion extends the local FDR criterion of Efron  and ensures control of the False Discovery Proportion (FDP) under arbitrary  correlation structure. We develop a fast and easily scalable Gibbs type itera tive algorithm to approximate the posterior class membership probabilities  that are otherwise hard to compute in general. Unlike the non parametric  estimation approach used in local FDR, we use a parametric three group normal mixture model for SNP Z scores with a known correlation matrix.  Using simulations under different correlation scenarios, we found that the  global FDR approach performs significantly better than local FDR, both in terms of power and accurate control of the type I error (FDP). We also con sidered a sequential procedure to select the most strongly associated SNPs  from independent (non redundant) regions of the genome discarding cor   related surrogates in the same LD region. We assessed the sensitivity and  specificity of our single step and sequential SNP selection strategies. The methods were also validated against known associated regions using pu blished GWAS data from the Collaborative Association Study of Psoriasis.",2014.0,,"A. Mukherjee, S.

Only 5 10% of all breast cancer have genetic predisposition and the number of women in the general population with breast cancer attributable to mutations in highly penetrance genes BRCA1 And BRCA2 is very low. These observations have led to the proposal that breast cancer susceptibility is largely polygenic and recent GWAS studies have identified some regions in the genome which contains SNP that can involved risk of developing breast cancer including FGFR2 (rs2981852) and miR146 (rs2910164). Moreover, several SNPs at the BRCA1 gene such as c.2731C>T (rs7999917), c.3232A>G (rs16941), c.3667A>G (rs16942), could modify the risk.

A germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP;  rs61764370), located in the let   7 complementary site 6 (LCS6) within the  3`UTR of the KRAS gene, affects the binding affinity of microRNA let 7 to the  KRAS mRNA and thus gene expression. It was published that KRAS LCS6 SNP is associated with the higher risk of NSCLC development, especially in  moderate smokers. Material and methods: DNA was isolated from biopsy  and cytology specimens with verified histological diagnosis. Mutation detec  tion was done by real time PCR. EGFR patients with no detected mutation were tested for ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements using the FISH method.  SNP (rs61764370) analysis was performed using PCR and RFLP . Results:  Numbers of positive/tested samples were: Activating EGFR mutations:  50/658 (7,5 %); ALK gene rearrangement: 39/405 (9,6 %); ROS1 gene re  arrangement: 1/159 (0,6 %).

As the GWAS field matures it is becoming clear that for many complex traits, a proportion of the missing heritability is attributable to common variants of individually small effect. Detecting these small effects individually can be difficult and statistical power would be increased if re levant variants could be grouped together for testing. We propose grouping markers together based on pre specified biological pathways. We have im plemented this pathway based test in the program Pathway VEGAS. The me thod is based on prior calculation of gene based p values using the existing Versatile Gene based Association Study (VEGAS) software. Pathway VEGAS uses the gene based P values to construct a pathway test based on a set of pre specified pathways. The method appropriately takes into account situa tions where neighbouring genes are present in the same pathway   results for relevant regions are calculated by accounting for linkage disequilibrium between markers using simulations from the multivariate normal distribu tion. Pathway size is taken into account via a re sampling approach. Impor tantly, since the approach only requires summary data, the method can be easily applied in all GWASs, including meta analysis, singleton based, family based and DNA pooling based designs.

We provide new insights into the genetic architecture of ASDs as our cohort is uniquely enriched for recessive loss of function variants. We follow up fin dings and draw comparisons with additional large ASD and control data   sets: the Simons Simplex and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collections (2,670 affected individuals; 9681 total individuals). Comparing across these cohorts, we demonstrate that ascertainment can lead to selec tion of different underlying genetic mechanisms causing ASDs. These diffe rences are reflected in metrics such as the affected male:female ratio and the relative contribution of de novo CNVs versus inherited homozygous de   letions. Specifically, we find that de novo CNVs play a significant role in non consanguineous families with a single affected child (p,0.04), but a lesser role in multiplex families, and they are no more common in ASD cases than  controls in multiplex consanguineous families.

We provide new insights into the genetic architecture of ASDs as our cohort is uniquely enriched for recessive loss of function variants. We follow up fin dings and draw comparisons with additional large ASD and control data   sets: the Simons Simplex and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collections (2,670 affected individuals; 9681 total individuals). Comparing across these cohorts, we demonstrate that ascertainment can lead to selec tion of different underlying genetic mechanisms causing ASDs. These diffe rences are reflected in metrics such as the affected male:female ratio and the relative contribution of de novo CNVs versus inherited homozygous de   letions. Specifically, we find that de novo CNVs play a significant role in non consanguineous families with a single affected child (p,0.04), but a lesser role in multiplex families, and they are no more common in ASD cases than  controls in multiplex consanguineous families.

2006,122, Context specific eQTLs identify hormonal effects in obese Finnish men,C08.1,,"Introduction: Obesity is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular and metabo   lic disease. Considering the steady increase in obesity prevalence and that GWAS variants explain <5% of body mass index variance, gene environment interactions may contribute to obesity. We hypothesized that expression profiles in adipose tissue may reflect the molecular consequences of envi ronmental changes underlying obesity. Accordingly, in an obese cellular en vironment, context specific expression quantitative trait loci (cseQTL) vari ants might regulate gene expression distinctly from non obese conditions.Materials and Methods: We performed eQTL mapping (FDR<1%) using 7,932,277 SNPs with adipose RNA sequence data on 17,210 expressed ge nes in 582 men from the Finnish METSIM cohort. We considered the eQTLs only observed in the obese group, but not in the non obese or overall groups as obese eQTLs (OB), and vice versa for non obese (NOB). We tested the OB and NOB eQTL genes for replication in an independent METSIM cohort (n,771) using microarray data (FDR<5%).Results: We discovered 2,450 OB eQTL genes regulated by 28,267 cis (+/ 1Mb) variants; and 1,455 NOB eQTL genes regulated by 10,814 vari ants, respectively. Of these 55% of the OB and 41% of the NOB genes were consistent across RNA seq and microarrays in independent cohorts. When searching for potential drivers of context specificity, we observed that estrogen signaling genes were enriched among OB versus NOB eQTL genes (P,0.001), including HSD17B12, which converts estrone into the most acti ve estrogen, estradiol.Conclusion: OB eQTL genes exhibit genetic dependent transcriptional regu lation mediated by obesity and involve genes in the estrogen pathway as regulators of male obesity.",2015.0,,"A.

So far, seven genes from this pathway have been reported in human disease.  Five of them are involved in autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X linked (SMC1A and HDAC8) Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and two of them  in autosomal recessive Roberts (ESCO2) and Warsaw Breakage syndromes  (DDX11). All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which,  along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3  males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel  lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency. Three had history of intrauterine growth retardation, two with prenatal onset  microcephaly, one with post natal growth retardation. One individual had  epilepsy, two had autistic features. The four patients shared common facial features, with widely spaced incisors, thin eyebrows, and high nasal bridge. The mechanism for haploinsufficiency was a small deletion encompassing  STAG1 diagnosed by array CGH in two individuals, an intragenic deletion in  STAG1 found by whole genome analysis in one individual, and a missense heterozygous mutation (c.641A>G) revealed by exome analysis in the last patient.

We found 15,644 candi  date regulatory SNPs of which more than 20% were rare, allele frequency  <1%, and showed evidence of larger functional effect than common SNPs. This high frequency of rare functional variants adds heterogeneity to GWA studies of traits and expression and may explain divergent GWAS results  between populations and why SNPs with the highest association signal rare  ly are functional. The majority of allele specific variants (95%) were specific to one of the six studied cell types. By examining GWAS loci we found >600  allele specific candidate SNPs, 184 of which were highly relevant in our cell  types. Results were confirmed by luciferase assays, EMSA and stimulation of primary cells. Functionally validated SNPs support identification of an in  tronic SNP in MERTK associated to risk for liver fibrosis, a SNP in SYNGR1  affecting risk for rheumatoid arthritis and primary biliary cirrhosis as well as a SNP in the last intron of COG6 affecting risk for psoriasis.

2035,210, Optimal ancestry matched imputation of GWAS association summary statistics using large reference panel of sequenced individuals,C22.2,,"The ultimate goal of GWASs is to find disease associated markers, preferab   ly causal variants. GWASs use microarrays to interrogate tag SNPs, there fore many untyped variants need to be inferred through imputation, using the available genotyped SNPs. As demonstrated recently [Pasaniuc et al. (2014)], not only genotypes, but association summary statistics, generated by large meta analytic studies, can be imputed.We propose several improvements to state of the art summary statistic imputation tools. We compute the optimal shrinking of the SNP SNP cor   relation matrix, which flexibly adapts to the reference panel size, local LD structure, region size, etc. In addition, our method allows for summary sta tistics that are dervied from variable sample sizes. Finally, we search for the optimal linear combination of reference panel sub populations in order to match their joint allele frequency distribution to that of the association stu dies. This is analogous to selecting the subset of the reference panel that best represents the individuals in the GWAS cohorts.Our extensive simulation study, using UK10K whole genome sequencing data sets, showed that our optimized shrinkage constant significantly out performs all previously proposed choices when the reference panel is small (<300). We also demonstrated the importance of ancestry weighted mixture using 1000 Genomes subpopulation panels combined with summary stati   stics simulated from our local CoLaus study (Firman et al., 2008). Finally, using cohort level association summary data from the GIANT (Genetic In vestigation of ANthropometric Traits) Consortium, we found that applying ancestry matched imputation of individual cohort summary statistics before meta analysis substantially outperforms the imputation of meta analysed association summary statistics.Financial support: Swiss National Science Foundation (31003A 143914, 51RTP0_151019).",2015.0,,"S.

2036,211, A novel method and software tool for genome wide multi phenotype analysis of rare variants,C22.3,,"Recently, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been expanded to analysis of low frequency and rare variants (MAFÃ¢ÂÂ¤5%, both denoted by RVs). Power for variant detection could also be increased by jointly analy   sing multiple correlated phenotypes. We have developed software for geno me wide Multi phenotype Analysis of RVs (MARV), combining features from both RV burden tests and multi phenotype analyses. Specifically, the pro portion of rare variants at which an individual carries minor alleles within a gene region is modelled on linear combinations of phenotypes in a regres   sion framework. MARV also implements model selection via the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We have applied this new method on three cor  related phenotypes: fasting insulin (FI), triglycerides (TG) and waist to hip ratio (WHR), using data from 4788 individuals from the Northern Finland  Birth Cohort 1966. Individuals were genotyped on the Illumina370CNV ar  ray and imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project all ancestries reference panel (March 2012). FI/TG/WHR were adjusted for body mass index and three  principal components to control for population structure. The following  transformations were applied: natural logarithm for FI and inverse normal for the residuals of TG and WHR. We identified RV associations, at genome  wide significance (p<1.7x10  6, Bonferroni correction for 30,000 genes) in  ZNF259 , which maps to a common variant GWAS locus for TG and coronary  heart disease. Based on BIC, the model with TG and FI provided the best  fit (Pmodel,3.1x10 9), and stronger associations than in univariate analyses  (PTG,6.7x10 8; PFI,0.13). Using MARV, we demonstrate its ability to identify  RV multi phenotype associations with greater statistical significance than  in univariate analyses.

Cases of neuropathic pain were de   fined as diabetic patients with a multiple prescription history of at least one of five drugs specifically indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Controls were diabetic individuals who were not prescribed any of these drugs, nor amitriptyline, carbamazepine, or nortriptyline. Those who had one use of the five specific neuropathic pain drugs were further excluded from controls. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test genetic associations, adjusting with covariates.Overall, 961 diabetic neuropathic pain cases and 3,260 diabetic controls were identified. We found a cluster in the Chr1p35.1 (ZSCAN20 TLR12P) with a lowest P value of 2.74 x 10 7 at rs71647933 in females and a cluster in the Chr8p23.1, next to HMGB1P46 with a lowest P value of 8.02x 10 7 at rs6986153 in males.

2081,390, Systematic analysis of chromatin interactions at disease associated loci links novel candidate genes to Inflammatory Bowel Disease,PM03.26,,"Introduction: Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed  numerous genomic loci that are associated with complex genetic diseases. Subsequently, many candidate genes have been defined, mainly based on the functional relationships between genes found in the vicinity of the identified loci. However, many of these loci can be linked to regulatory DNA sequences and it is now widely appreciated that part of the GWAS associations is due to sequence variation in regulatory elements. Therefore, the genes controlled by these regulatory elements should be considered as possible candidate genes. Since regulatory elements can regulate genes via chromatin chroma tin interactions that comprise up to 1 Mb, these genes cannot be identified based on base pair distance from the regulatory regions.

2081,390, Systematic analysis of chromatin interactions at disease associated loci links novel candidate genes to Inflammatory Bowel Disease,PM03.26,,"Introduction: Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed  numerous genomic loci that are associated with complex genetic diseases. Subsequently, many candidate genes have been defined, mainly based on the functional relationships between genes found in the vicinity of the identified loci. However, many of these loci can be linked to regulatory DNA sequences and it is now widely appreciated that part of the GWAS associations is due to sequence variation in regulatory elements. Therefore, the genes controlled by these regulatory elements should be considered as possible candidate genes. Since regulatory elements can regulate genes via chromatin chroma tin interactions that comprise up to 1 Mb, these genes cannot be identified based on base pair distance from the regulatory regions.

Sagittal non  syndromic craniosynostosis (sNCS) has an estimated prevalence of ~2 per  10,000 live births. Our recent GWAS study identified robust associations to locus on chromosome 20 that is 345kb 3Ã¢ÂÂ of BMP2 . We did not identify any  coding BMP2  variant, suggesting that variants in the associated region near  BMP2 may harbor regulatory elements responsible for the phenotype. To test this we monitored the expression of BMP2  in primary calvarial osteo  blasts from sNCS patients. We observed overexpression of BMP2  and heigh  tened BMP2 signaling in 2 out of 8 osteoblast cell lines. In order to deter   mine if rs1884302 variation causes functional changes, a 716 bp fragment was cloned into a zebrafish enhancer detector (ZED) vector with the wild  type allele (T) or the risk allele (C). Zebrafish transgenesis carried out with  both fragments resulted in a strong expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the head of the transgenic fish with a C, but not with the T alllele  of rs1884302. Our in vitro results suggest that overexpression of BMP2  by  altered regulatory activity near this gene contributes to the etiology of sNSC,  while in vivo results indicate that the differences in regulatory activity are  dependent on the C or the T allele.",2015.0,,"C.

We tested whether polygenic risk for CAD was associated with cognitive ability in community dwelling cohorts of middle aged and older adults.Materials and Methods: Individuals from Generation Scotland: Scottish Fa mily Health Study (GS:SFHS, N,9865) and from the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (LBC1921, N,517) and 1936 (LBC1936, N,1005) provided cognitive data and genome wide genotype data. Polygenic risk profile scores for CAD were calculated for all of the cohorts using the largest available GWAS data set, the CARDIoGRAM consortium (22,233 cases and 64,762 controls). Poly   genic risk profile scores for CAD were then tested for their association with cognitive abilities in the presence and absence of manifest cardiovascular disease.Results: A meta analysis of all three cohorts supported a negative associati on between CAD polygenic risk and fluid cognitive ability, verbal intelligence and memory. Whereas these findings were not statistically significant in the Lothian Birth Cohorts, in GS:SFHS polygenic risk for CAD was negatively and significantly associated with fluid cognitive ability (ÃÂ² ,  0.02, p , 0.03), Mill Hill Vocabulary test (ÃÂ² ,  0.03, p , 0.006) and Logical Memory (ÃÂ² ,  0.02, p , 0.042).Conclusions: Increased polygenic risk for CAD is associated with lower co gnitive ability in older adults.

2158,687, De novo 19p13.2 microdeletion encompassing the part of NFIX gene in a girl with Sotos like phenotype,PM08.02,,"19p13.2 microdeletion is a rare genomic disorder. To date, less than ten cases was described so far in the literature. This chromosomal syndrome manifests in developmental delay/intellectual impairment, postnatal over   growth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphy, slender habitus, advanced bone age, and scoliosis. Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent. Very similar phenotype is observed in the Sotos syndrome 2 (MIM #614753) that is caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions of the NFIX gene located on chromosome 19p13.2.Here, we report on the case of a 7 year old girl referred to genetic counse   ling because of psychomotor retardation, speech delay and dysmorphic fea tures (macrocephaly, long/narrow and triangular face, high forehead, fron tal bossing, downslanting palpebral fissures, dysplastic low set ears, small nose, flat philtrum, micrognathia). At the examination, behavioral problems (anxiety, tantrums, autoaggression), seizures, and poor coordination were noted. Skeletal anomalies (advanced bone age, joint laxity, slender hands with long fingers, abnormal setting of the lower limbs), strabismus, hypero pia as well as constipations and abdominal pain were also diagnosed.Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a de novo 158.18 kb (the smallest so far) deletion of 19p13.2 region (chr19:13,020,206 13,178,390; hg19) encompassing seven genes; three of them (NFIX, DAND5 and CALR) could be the candidate genes for the genotype phenotype rela   tionship.This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13.2 microdeletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region.

2160,691, A milder Angelman syndrome phenotype due to a novel molecular mechanism: a maternally inherited 30kb deletion of 15q11.2 including the main gene promoter and non coding exon1 of UBE3A,PM08.06,,"We present a novel molecular cause of Angelman syndrome (AS) in a female patient with microcephaly, dysmorphism, global developmental and speech  delay and intellectual disability. Her phenotype resembles a milder form of  AS with no seizures and 20 words of speech at the age of 5 years. EEG inve stigation of the patient showed typical AS findings. Suspecting a clinical diagnosis of AS, molecular analysis was undertaken  using methylation specific PCR (MS PCR) and revealed normal methylation at the SNRPN DMR ruling out UPD, deletion or an imprinting defect asso   ciated with the majority of AS. Sequencing of the coding exons of UBE3A  revealed no pathogenic mutations. Microarray CGH identified a maternally  inherited 30kb deletion at 15q11.2 involving exon 1 of UBE3A. This deletion was de novo in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother and linkage analysis revealed the origin  of the deletion in the grand paternal allele, explaining the normal pheno  type in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother due to genomic imprinting.Although intragenic deletions of the maternal copy of UBE3A are a recog  nised cause of AS, to date there have been no reported deletions of exon 1.  Exon 1 is non protein coding and therefore not routinely sequenced. The intragenic deletion in our patient also includes the main promoter of UBE3A adjacent to exon 1 and the milder phenotype in our patient may be explai   ned by secondary promoters downstream producing transcripts.We present the detailed clinical phenotype of our patient, discuss the initial difficulties of interpreting the clinical significance of this novel finding and present the subsequent RNA/expression analysis.",2015.0,,"D.

2167,708, A novel HCN1 mutation not associated with epileptic encephalopathy,PS08.23,,"B. Rossi Hospital, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita  bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy   perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety  of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity.  Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as  sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi  leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with  different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits. Here we report the case of a 9 year old girl with a Rett like phenotype, cha  racterized by intellectual disability, hand stereotypies, absent speech, nega tive brain MRI and EEG data and no history of epilepsy. By NGS approach,  with the use of a targeted intellectual disability/epilepsy gene panel, we  found the girl to carry a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the HCN1 gene. This mutation is located in the glycine tyrosine glycine (GYG) motif, which constitutes the ion selectivity filter typical of K+  permeable channels.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects.We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con   tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase.This innovative strategy to collect information on natural history and co morbidities of rare monogenic forms of ID/autism will promote familiesÃ¢ÂÂ empowerment and hopefully impact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ care.

Copy number variations (CNV) in RBFOX1, also known as A2BP1, have been associated with human neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disease.This gene, spanning 1.7 MB on chromosome 16p13.3, is one of the largest genes in the human genome, responsible for encoding splicing regulatory factors, specifically expressed in neurons and muscles, and having a regula  tory action in alternative splicing of a large tissue specific gene networks. Materials and methods: Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, using an Agi  lent 4x180K platform, was performed in 1200 patients with mental retarda tion, autism spectrum disorders and congenital anomalies. Results: In our cohort, we identified 6 cases with intragenic deletions in RB  FOX1, 4 of them with additional CNV in other chromosomes. These CNVs are located at 16p13.3, extended in a 1,2Mb region between 6,087,983 7   ,207,012 (GRCh37/hg19), which corresponds to intronic regions in 5 out of  6 patients. Five of these patients have an inherited deletion, from an unaffec  ted progenitor, and one has an unknown inheritance pattern.Conclusions: The phenotypes of all these children have in common, as wide  ly described, neurological alterations. The rearrangements identified lead to  a reduction in RBFOX1 expression, corroborating the importance of RBFOX1 haploinsufficiency in this phenotypes. The continuing follow up of these  patients and similar cases can help our understanding on the phenotypic  diversity of these patients.",2015.0,,"N. Lavoura1, J. B. Melo1, S. I. Ferreira1, M. C.

In contrast one CGI showed intermediate methylation levels with substantial intra individual variation. Follow up analysis of this CGI identified a significant difference in DNA methylation levels between the BPD cases and healthy controls.

2222,850, The PCSK6 intronic region associated with handedness controls expression of a novel shorter isoform,PS09.097,,"We recently reported the first gene, PCSK6, associated with handedness at genome wide significance level (P< 0.5*10 8, Brandler et al. 2013). A Va riable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) within the same PCSK6 locus has been found to be associated with degree of handedness in an indepen   dent study (Arning et al. 2013). Interestingly, PCSK6 is known to activate NODAL, a morphogen involved in a highly conserved pathway known to regulate left/right body axis determination. Our previous data suggest these pathways controlling development of LR asymmetry in the body are reused for brain midline development, which in turn influence functional asymmetries such as handedness (Brandler and Paracchini 2014). All pre vious most significant associations fall within a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block containing a secondary promoter our data show to be bidirectional in nature and controlling transcription of both a novel PCSK6 isoform and a long non coding antisense RNA. Taking forward previous GWAS findings, we have conducted a detailed functional analysis using a combination of further genetic analysis, in silico predictions, and molecular assays. Our functional studies support an allele specific effect on transcription factor binding affinity for a previous top associated SNP rs11855425 however our genetic data could not find any evidence supporting a VNTR role. With this study we have dissected the molecular mechanisms underlying the PCSK6 association with handedness, indicating the regulatory effect the region has on specific RNA isoforms. Future work will focus on understanding the function of the novel shorter PCSK6 isoform and confirming the identity and role of the transcription factors binding at the secondary promoter.Neuro dys018696, WT090532/Z/09/Z, MRCG090074791070, G1000569/1 and MR/J003719/1.",2015.0,,"R.

Different studies have already pointed to  an impairment of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity as an underlying cause of SCZ pathology. To elucidate a putative contribution of genetic SHANK3 variants  to the etiology of SCZ, we sequenced the gene in 500 affected individuals and compared the sequencing results to ancestral   ly matched controls. Novel SHANK3 missense variants were identified in 1.6 % of the screened individuals, three of which were predicted as deleterious by at least two different algorithms. We identified association of 5 genetic variants, with study wide significance(P<0.001).

Progressively acquires suck swallow coordination and no si gnificant symptoms associated were observed. An atrial septal defect (ASD) (ostium secundum) was diagnosed by echocardiography and the patient was discharged for control in external consultations.On the exploration at 3m slightly decreased axial, lower limbs on flexion (without arthrogryposis), increased tendon reflexes, and peculiar phenoty   pic traits (hypertelorism and almond shaped palpebral fissures, short phil trum, thin upper lip and microstomia) were observed.At 15 months, the ASD was repared. He presented a convergent not paretic  strabismus, the muscle tone was improved in general but the lower limb  tone was increased when excited, the reflexes were symmetrical but exal   ted and the CPR was extensor bilateral. We observed a limitation of joints  extension which improved in subsequent controls. Now, at 41momths, he  presented a global developmental delay with autistic traits.The aCGH (Nimblegen, 720K) performed defined a 60Kb deletion on  7q11.22, not seen in the aCGH (qChip  R, 60K), and confirmed by MLPA in  the AUTS2 gene.Balanced genomic rearrangements disrupting AUTS2 gene have been iden   tified implicating AUTS2 in neurodevelopmental disorders.

A 10 year old boy with speech delay, dysmorphic features, short stature, joint hyperlaxity, muscular hypotony and conductive deafness is presented. His father was diagnosed with X linked spondilopehyseal dysplasia tarda.Birth parameters were normal. In the first months he developed motor de   velopmental delay with muscular hypotony. At one year short stature was diagnosed. Repeatedly he has been treated for mild middle ear infections and a conductive hearing loss was diagnosed at 10 years. At this age (height 130,67 cm ( 1.793 SDS); weight 28,25 kg ( 1.194 SDS); head circumference 55,5 cm (0.478 SDS)) he presented with two cafe au lait spots. Several dys morphic features were observed: long face, high vaulted palate, wide, retro verted nostrils, low set ears, tag on the lobule, deep philtrum, tented upper lip, joint hyperlaxity, proximal placed thumbs, wide spaced nipples and 2 3 toe syndactily of the both feet. The boy had difficulties in fine motor skills, concentration, attention and social skills. At the age of 11,5 years suspect of autism spectrum disorder was made.aCGH detected interstitial duplication of approximately 6.1Mb at 15q11.2q13.1 (arr[hg19] 15q11.2q13.1(22,765,628 28,940,098)ÃÂ3 mat), subsequently confirmed by FISH.

A. Nemec3,",PS12.031,,"Background:The polymorphism rs61764370 is a functional variant in the let7a binding site of KRAS that is associated with increased cancer risk, particularly breast and ovarian. This risk may be modified by menopausal status and HRT use.Aim:To evaluate the effect of estrogen exposure and withdrawal on development of breast cancer in patients with the KRAS variant (vKRAS).Methods:Isogenic mammary (MCF10A) cell lines with and without vKRAS were cultured and observed for oncogenic transformation in charcoal stripped media following oestrogen withdrawal and restoration. Cells with and wi thout vKRAS were examined for epithelial mesenchymal transition(EMT) by western blot, immunoflourescence, and relative quantification of EMT associated miRNAs. The effect of the vKRAS on disease phenotype was in vestigated in a cohort of patients with breast cancer, comparing variant and wild type genotype carriers. A case control analysis was also performed using a control group of unaffected vKRAS carriers. Data was collected with respect to pathological characteristics, reproductive risk factors and anthro pomorphic measurements.Results:Isogenic cell lines with vKRAS showed evidence of EMT , with relative over expression of vimentin and fibronectin. Acute estrogen withdrawal by addi   tion of tamoxifen to charcoal stripped media led to 7.9 fold increase in on cogenic transformation, with reduction in colony formation after restitution of oestrogen. Affected vKRAS carriers were significantly more likely to have oophorectomy pre diagnosis than wild type patients(p,0.033). Affected vKRAS carriers with breast cancer had lower BMI(p<0.01) than vKRAS un affected controls. HRT discontinuation in vKRAS carriers was significantly associated with post menopausal triple negative breast cancer.Conclusions: Estrogen withdrawal and a low estrogen state appear to in crease breast cancer and predict aggressive tumor biology in women with variant KRAS.",2015.0,,"J.

Lung cancers show the highest number of cancer associations with human MHC (HLA) region. For a systematic analysis, we extracted 73 SNPs located within chromosome 6: 29 to 33Mb and associated with lung cancer from the GWAS catalog, dbGAP , and GRASP database (P<5E 04), of which 59 exceeded the genome wide statisti cal significance threshold (P < 5E 08). Only three of those were listed in the GWAS catalog (rs3117582, rs3817963, rs2395185), with BAG6 rs3117582 being the most consistently observed. Associations were with squamous ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.ESHG.ORG 256Back to inde x cell and adenocarcinoma, as well as lung cancers in never smoked women.  These SNPs also show associations with Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, and  prostate cancers. Three SNPs occur as somatic mutations in breast and co  lon cancers (rs7750641, rs3749971, rs3134942). Two SNPs (rs3117582, rs1150752) map into CgG islands, one (rs9276472) is within 500bp of a  microRNA sequence (MIR3135B), three in non coding RNA genes, and two  are deleterious missense variants (rs9262143, rs7775397) in KIAA1949 and C6orf10. Only one SNP was in an HLA gene (rs2187668, HLA DQA1, non coding) and none were in a sequence encoding peptide binding region  of HLA molecules. However, 35 of the 73 SNPs scored the highest gene regu  latory function in RegulomeDB analysis. Most notably, rs3117582 and its six statistically indistinguishable (r2 , 1) and 41 statistically similar (r2 > 0.8)  SNPs had high levels of functionality.

Our case, diagnosed with schizophrenia, also presents manifestations that are characteristic for  autistic spectrum disorders. Based on her academic performances, our pati   ent might have a superior than average intellect. The result of the arrayCGH analysis showed genomic imbalances including  several genes. From the list of deleted/duplicated genes, one that was pre  viously reported in patients with psychotic disorders is the SHANK3 gene. ArrayCGH analysis for our case identified an 82.3 Kb duplication of chro  mosome 22q from 51.055.575 51.137.968 bp; this region encompassed the  SHANK3. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother did not carry the duplication. The genetic analysis for father was not possible because he is deceased. Several papers have reported SHANK3 gene variants in autistic spectrum consisting of both  copy number variants and point mutations. The presence of three copies of the SHANK3 gene was reported in associa   tion with autistic spectrum disorders in other papers.

The origins of somatic genome variations manifesting as structural chro mosomal rearrangements remain largely unknown. However, it is generally  accepted that susceptibility to structural chromosome aberrations can be  produced by alterations to DNA sequences flanking the breakpoints or to rearranged chromosomal regions (i.e. CNV). Addressing genome variations  in children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital  malformations (n,200) by high resolution CNV analysis (molecular karyo typing; resolution: 1 kbp or higher), we have surprisingly found that somatic structural chromosome abnormalities can co occur with non mosaic ones  within the same loci. More precisely, we detected 8 cases (4%) (4 dupli  cations and 4 deletions) demonstrating small non mosaic structural chro mosome rearrangements encompassed by larger mosaic ones. The dupli  cations were mosaic dup3p26.3p26.1 (5.8 Mb) vs. regular dup3p26.1 (2.9  Mb); mosaic dup14q32.13q32.2 (4.5 Mb) vs. regular dup14q32.2 (1.8 Mb); mosaic dup17p13.1p11.2 (6.9 Mb) vs. regular dup17p12 (1.4 Mb); mosaic  dup18p11.32p11.31 (5.3 Mb) vs. regular dup18p11.32p11.31 (4.8 Mb). The  deletions were mosaic del5q35.1q35.3 (9.2 Mb) vs. regular del5q35.2q35.3 (2.3 Mb); mosaic del14q11.2 (2.2 Mb) vs. regular del14q11.2 (0.5 Mb); mo saic del15q13.1q14 (8.2 Mb) vs. regular del15q13.2q13.3 (2 Mb); mosaic  delXp22.32p22.2 (4.7 Mb) vs. regular delXp22.31 (0.7 Mb). These findings  allowed us to hypothesize small regular structural variations (CNV) to be able to produce locus specific constitutional chromosome instability resul  ting in larger somatic rearrangements.

Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain,  3Clinical Farmacology Service. Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain. Introduction: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the second cause of  dead in the world. Development of monoclonal antibodies against Epider   mal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Cetuximab and Panitumumab, has in  creased the survival of patients with mCRC. The efficiency of these drugs  depends on the use of genetic biomarkers such as KRAS and, recently, NRAS.  It has been found that patients with mutations in these genes have poorer survival rate when they are treated with anti EGFR therapy. The objective of this study is to perform a mutational analysis of NRAS in patients with  mCRC, and correlate the findings with the response to anti EGFR drugs. Material and Methods: We performed mutational analysis by pyrosequen   cing to detect the commonest changes in codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117 and 146  of NRAS, in tumours samples of 493 patients with mCRC treated with anti EGFR drugs, and whose KRAS mutational status has been studied previous   ly. We also compared the percentage of mutations detected in the different  codons of KRAS and NRAS with previous works. Results: We have found 15 mutations in NRAS in 15 tumour samples. Four teen did not have mutations in KRAS. Codon 61 is the most frequently muta   ted. The percentages obtained in our study are in agreement with previous studies.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a percentage of KRAS negative colorectal tumours has mutations in NRAS, and that this status would be related to the response of anti EGFR therapy.",2015.0,,"G.

2383,1431, Statistical procedure for pathway guided GWAS analysis,PS16.29,,"Genome wide Association (GWA) studies have discovered thousands of po lymorphisms affecting the risk of various complex traits. For most of these  traits, exploration of the identified polymorphisms has revealed that the va  riants tend to be clustered near genes involved in few biological pathways.  It therefore appears naÃÂ¯ve to perform an unbiased GWA scan without taking pathway/network information into account. Post hoc enrichment analysis only helps in interpretation of already discovered variants; it does not im  prove the power for novel discovery. It is now recognized that typical GWAS  are under powered to detect all associated variants due to a huge multiple  testing burden. This is particularly true for variants that are relatively less common and/or those with weaker effects that could have been missed in GWA studies conducted thus far. Pathway/network information, if properly  harnessed, has the potential to improve the power of GWAS drastically. Here  we propose a generic statistical procedure that can utilize pathway infor   mation a priori while conducting a GWA scan. It automatically enhances the power to discover associated variants that are clustered in pathways. We de   monstrate that, our procedure adapts to the data to maintain correct type 1  error (even if the pathway information is irrelevant). At the same time it can  give huge power gains if the associated variants indeed cluster in pathways.  Our method is fast and easy to implement even with summary level data  (p values and odds ratios) from previous GWA studies.

However, the biological context in which these genetic risk factors exert their biological effect is often unknown. Here, the analysis of genetic variants that influence gene expression (eQTLs) has gained major impor   tance. The aim of our present study was to systematically map eQTLs in human hair follicle that can be used to functionally annotate genetic risk factors for hair related traits. Genome wide genotyping of blood DNA and transcriptome profiling of hair follicle RNA was performed on IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs OmniExpress  and HT12v4 arrays. After imputation of genotypes and qua lity control, a total of 6,593,881 SNPs and 14,687 expression probes from 97 individuals remained for analysis.

An epigenome wide association study (EWAS) was performed using DNA methylation data from >470K CpG sites in 729 individuals and a genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed using >8 million genotyped and imputed SNPs in 1033 individuals from a population based cohort.Results revealed EWAS significant CpG sites and GWAS significant SNPs (Bonferroni adjusted p values <0.05) for 45 and 36 biomarkers respectively. In total 189 CpG sites, distributed over 130 loci and 4361 SNPs at 31 loci were identified. Many SNPs are located within or close to (<1Mb) the gene encoding the respective biomarker. A subset of the EWAS and GWAS signals overlap, suggesting that these represent the same underlying regulatory fac tor, while other signals characterize different regulatory factors. Some CpG sites are associated with multiple biomarkers, e.g. one in the inflammatory gene NLRC5.Integrating GWAS and EWAS data gives a unique possibility to study their respective roles in regulating protein biomarkers.

2398,1473, Genomic/epigenomic defects associated with surprisingly detected parental consanguinity uncovered by molecular karyotyping with SNP arrays,PS17.09,,"Parental consanguinity is generally accepted to be a risk factor for hereditary diseases. However, parents may not know about their consanguinity. As a re sult, clinical genetic evaluation is unable to provide a preliminary diagnosis for performing targeted molecular genetic diagnosis. Fortunately, there do exist whole genome scanning techniques making possible to detect not only genomic but also epigenomic variations (i.e. segmental loss of heterozygo sity or SLOH) for evaluating levels of consanguinity. Here, we have analyzed genomes of 188 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformations using SNP/oligonucleotide molecular karyoty   ping (Affymetrix) and an original bioinformatic technology for addressing phenotypic, cellular and molecular consequences of genomic/epigenomic variations. SLOH, specific to clinical manifestations in these children, were found in 6 cases (3.2%). It is to note that parental consanguinity was not initially reported in all these cases. In one child, Meier Gorlin syndrome was diagnosed. Other cases were also associated with hereditary diseases. Two cases of SLOH indirectly related to the phenotype were associated with mi crodeletions in 14q22.1 and 15q15.2, respectively. Parental consanguinity has long been considered as a source of knowledge about origins of here ditary diseases. In the present study, the possibility of genetic analyses of children born in consanguineous marriages has been extended by whole genome and bioinformatic analyses. Actually, it has been shown that sur prisingly detected consanguinity can be relatively common and molecular diagnosis using SNP arrays and bioinformatics can be useful for revealing of mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic diseases.

2403,1486, A retrospective analysis of the prevalence of imprinting disorders in Estonia,PM17.22,,"Introduction: Imprinting disorders (IDs) are a group of rare congenital  diseases affecting growth, development and metabolism. The cause of IDs is an aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities. At present, there are eight clinically well recognized IDs. Be cause of high variability of clinical phenotype and molecular alterations, the exact prevalence of IDs is not known.Methods: In this study we retrospectively reviewed records of all Estonian patients with molecularly confirmed ID diagnosis during the period 1998 2014.Results: A total of 52 individuals with IDs were identified. 46% (24) of them had Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), 23% (12) Angelman syndrome (AS), 13%(7) Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), 12% (6) Silver Russell syndrome (SRS), 2% (1) Temple syndrome (TS), 2% (1) pseudohypopa rathyroidism Ib (PHP Ib) and 2% (1) transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM). No cases of Kagami Ogata syndrome have been found. The age of diagnosis varied between 0.03 and 83 years. All cases of TS, PHP Ib, TNDM and the most cases of SRS and BWS were diagnosed in the last 4 years due to new diagnostic tests. During the period 2004 2014 birth prevalence of PWS in Estonia was 1/13,634 live births (~1/18,000 worldwide), AS 1/32,722 (~1/16,000), BWS 1/40,903 (~1/13,000) and SRS 1/54,537 (~1/70,000). Thus the total prevalence of IDs in Estonia is 4/100,000.Conclusions: The introduction of new diagnostic methods allows todiscover cases of rare and atypical IDs.

Infection peak age is between 6 months and 2y. The heritability for gastroenteritis has been estimated in 54%. We performed a genome wide association meta analysis (GWAMA) to identify genetic variants for gastroenteritis susceptibility du ring first years of life.Material and Methods: Six thousand children from 5 European cohorts from The EArly Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) Consortium par ticipated in the discovery phase. Gastroenteritis was defined based on que stionnaire data or medical records at ages 1y and 2y. Gastroenteritis with or without clinical diagnosis were used as outcomes and followed in enrich   ment pathway analysis (MAGENTA KEGG).

2485,1825, Molecular genetic analyses of single nucleotide polymorphism in the ZBTB17 gene in Slovak patients with dilated cardiomyopathy,J05.11,,"A.Reyman,  PreÃÂ¡ov, Slovakia, 3Cardiology, Reimanus, PreÃÂ¡ov, Slovakia. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a primary myocardial disease and geneti cally heterogeneous disorder. It represents a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is characterized by systolic dysfunction, dilati on, and impaired contraction of the ventricles, often leading to chronic heart failure and eventually requiring cardiac transplantation. Mutations in both sarcomeric and cytoskeletal genes have been implicated in DCM. Recently, a GWAS study on DCM indicated that rs10927875 single nucleotide poly   morphism (SNP) in ZBTB17 gene was associated with DCM. The aim of the study was to analyze the distribution of SNP rs10927875 in ZBTB17 gene in 150 Slovak subjects, 55 patients with DCM (51.7ÃÂ±6.9 years) and 95 healthy controls (51.7ÃÂ±6.9 years) using the Custom TaqmanÃÂ®SNP Genotyping as says. The distribution of ZBTB17 gene rs10927875 polymorphism in Slovak patients with DCM was as follows: CC (36.4%), CT (58.2%), TT (5.4%), in controls: CC (44.2%), CT (51.6%), TT (4.2%). There was no difference in genotype or allele frequencies in ZBTB17 gene rs10927875 polymorphism (OR,0.75, 95% CI,0.46 1.23, P,0.25) between DCM patients and control subjects. Further studies in numerous files and additional functional inve stigations are needed to fully understand the roles of genetic associations.

2576,2176, General Regression Model: a powerful Ã¢ÂÂmodel freeÃ¢ÂÂ association test for both qualitative and quantitative traits allowing to determine the underlying genetic model of transmission,J18.29,,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are usually assessed using regres   sion models, assuming additive mode of transmission. This choice leads to a  significant loss of power in case of departure from additivity. We propose a General Regression Model (GRM) allowing detection of association without making hypothesis of the mode of transmission. Additionally, GRM permits the simultaneous estimation of the underlying genetic model. We compared the power of GRM to additive and other classical regression association tests under a large panel of genetic models.Powers were estimated by simulation of a 2000 cases and 2000 controls sample for qualitative traits and a sample of 5000 cases for quantitative traits. Four association tests (GRM, additive, recessive or dominant tests) were applied to all replicates. The genetic underlying mode of transmission was then tested using GRM.For both qualitative and quantitative trait, we showed that GRM powers to detect association was similar or greater to that of the additive test. In the case of recessive inheritance, gain of power up to 66% for qualitative and to 93% for quantitative traits respectively. The correct underlying model was determined in most cases.GRM test appears powerful to detect association, as much as or even more than the classically used additive test, especially in case of recessive inhe   ritance.

The reanalysis of available Ge nome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data with novel sequencing based reference panels is a promising and cost effective approach to unravel and to better characterize the genetic factors that give susceptibility to tumor related processes.Materials and Methods: We developed GWImp COMPSs, an integrated fra mework that performs imputation and association testing, to re analyze 9 different cancer data, comprising around 80,000 subjects, through imputa   tion with UK10K, 1000 Genomes phase 3 and Go NL. To date, we have ana   lyzed 9,124 samples for bladder cancer and 11,209 samples for lung cancer.Results: Beyond confirming and fine mapping known loci for these cancers,  we identified two novel loci associated with bladder cancer in the ZCCHC7   gene (MAF, 0.01, OR,0.28, p,5.7e 11, regulatory region variant) and in the GRIN2B gene (MAF, 0.01, OR,4.77, p,9.1e 11, intron variant). For lung  cancer, a novel associated locus  was found near the TECRL gene (MAF,0.01,  OR,3.16, p,2.4e 8).Importantly, the ZCCHC7  intragenic variant is highly conserved and, accor   ding to ENCODE and TRANSFAC, is a DNase I hypersensitive site with open chromatin histone marks (H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac), and it is predicted to disrupt the transcription factor binding site for several tran scription factors, including the binding of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1.

2599,142, A potential role for the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) in the neuroanatomical phenotype of the 220kb 16p11,C15.2,,"Copy number variants (CNVs) of the distal 16p11.2 220kb BP2 BP3 regi  on show mirror effect on BMI and head size, and association with autism  spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia, as previously reported for  the proximal 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 deletion and duplication. These two CNVs prone regions at 16p11.2 are also reciprocally engaged in complex  chromatin looping, successfully confirmed by 4C, FISH, Hi C and concomi   tant expression changes. We assessed the 220kb BP2 BP3 duplication by  overexpressing each of the 9 encompassed human transcripts, CD19, NFAT   C2IP , ATXN2L, TUFM, ATP2A1, RABEP2, SPNS1, LAT and SH2B1, in zebrafish  embryos. Overexpression of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) induced  a reduction in dividing cells in the brain and number of post mitotic neurons in the anterior forebrain at 2dpf, and of intertectal axonal tracts at 3dpf, re  sulting in microcephaly at later stages. We showed similar results upon ove  rexpression of CD247 and ZAP70, two genes belonging to the LATÃ¢ÂÂs immune system signaling pathway. Co injections experiments showed that KCTD13,  MVP , and MAPK3, three genes mapping within the 600kb BP4 BP5 locus and  major driver and modifiers, respectively, of the head circumference pheno type linked to that region, and LAT acted in an additive manner to increase the severity of the microcephaly phenotype, suggesting the presence of ge netic interaction. Chromatin conformation capture further showed that LAT cis  and trans interacting chromatin partners were enriched for ASD genes (p,5.6E 03, OR,1.9).

2602,147, FINEMAP: Ultrafast high resolution fine mapping using summary data from genome wide association studies,C16.1,,"Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of loci associated with complex diseases. A next crucial step is fine mapping: iden   tifying causal variants that point to molecular mechanisms behind the asso   ciations and, eventually, suggest therapeutic targets. Recently, fine mapping methods have been extended to use only GWAS summary data together with pairwise correlations of the variants. Common to these approaches is that they rely on computationally expensive exhaustive search restricting their use to a few hundred variants. We introduce a software package FINEMAP that replaces the exhaustive search by an ultrafast stochastic search and the reby allows fine mapping analyses to scale up to whole chromosomes.We show that FINEMAP (1) opens up completely new opportunities by, e.g., exploring 15q21/LIPC locus for HDL cholesterol with 20,000 variants in less than 90 seconds while exhaustive search would require more than 9,000 years, (2) provides similar accuracy to exhaustive search when the latter can be completed, (3) achieves even higher accuracy when the latter must be restricted due to computational reasons, and (4) identifies more plausible variant combinations than conditional analysis. At 15q21/LIPC locus with at least a 3 SNP association pattern with HDL, a missense vari ant and a promoter polymorphism are likely to be causal whereas the lead variant in single SNP testing has less evidence than a regulatory variant cor   related with it.We believe that FINEMAPÃ¢ÂÂs approach of jointly modeling the whole locus together with its unprecedented computational efficiency will help reveal  valuable knowledge that could otherwise remain hidden due to limitations  of existing fine mapping methods.",2016.0,,"C.

2605,158," A syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of acute liver failure, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar vermis atrophy, and ataxia is caused by disruptive mutations in SCYL1",C17.6,,"Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States,  6Division of Pediatric  Neurology, University ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital, Zurich, ZÃÂ¼rich, Switzerland. Hereditary cerebellar ataxias are heterogeneous disorders characterized by gait disturbances, often accompanied by additional neurological symptoms and involvement of other organs. Here, we report on three human individu als from two unrelated families, who presented with recurrent episodes of acute liver failure in early infancy, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar vermis atrophy, and ataxia. By whole exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous mutations within the SCYL1 gene in all affected individuals. All mutations identified were predictably disruptive, causing loss of SCYL1 at the protein level. Despite clear parallels in clinical phenotypes between a Scyl1 deficient mouse model and human patients, recurrent hepatic fai lure represents a non neurological clinical manifestation that has not been anticipated from the mouse study. SCYL1 belongs to the evolutionarily high ly conserved SCY1 like family of catalytically inactive protein kinases and plays an important constituent of the coatomer (COPI) coated vesicles me diated membrane trafficking machinery. We showed that in SCYL1 deficient human fibroblasts the Golgi apparatus is massively enlarged, substantiating the notion that SCYL1 maintains Golgi morphology by interacting with se   veral key components of COPI coats. Intriguingly, SCYL1 shares a functional role in retrograde Golgi transport with the NBAS gene, which was recently implicated in a syndromic as well as a non syndromic form of recurrent episodes of infantile liver failure, which suggests a common pathogenetic underpinning.Our study demonstrates that the discovery of human disease related ge nes can be accelerated by studying naturally occurring mouse mutants and further argues for an unbiased genome wide strategy in the molecular dia gnosis of patients with rare inherited disorders.C18 Eye Disorder",2016.0,,"R.

2608,188, The landscape of polymorphic inversions and their functional impact in the human genome,C23.3,,"Recent advances in genomic techniques have generated an increasing inte rest in structural variants (SVs). However, there is still limited data on their functional impact. This is particularly true for inversions, in which their ba   lanced nature and the complex repetitive regions where they appear make their study especially challenging. In this regard, we have designed a null model to elucidate the functional characteristics of these variants, taking as reference the most reliable set of human polymorphic inversions so far from the InvFEST database. Human inversions show the signature of natural selection, avoiding more often than expected not only genes, but also other functional elements such as enhancers, chromatin domain boundaries and highly conserved regions. Moreover, we measured the effect of 45 experi mentally genotyped polymorphic inversions on gene expression based on the transcriptome data from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 175 individuals from the Geuvadis project. Using a combination of well established tools and further filtering criteria to minimize false positives, we found that alt   hough the majority of inversions do not appear to have any significant regu latory effect in this cell type, around half a dozen of them have a clear influ ence on specific genes, both in cis and in trans. Finally, we intersected SNPs reported as GWAS hits of different human phenotypes with the inversions in our dataset.

2615,340, Identification by exome sequencing and functional characterization of nonobvious pathogenic variants responsible for Alport syndrome,P03.06,,"Introduction: Alport syndrome (AS) is a progressive inherited renal disease caused by mutations in three large collagen IV genes (COL4A3, COL4A4, CO L4A5), comprising about 50 exons each. Recently, the introduction of next  generation sequencing allowed the analysis of all three AS genes in a single  step. Despite that, the total mutation detection rate has been estimated bet   ween 55 80%. Materials and Methods: We selected three Italian families with clear clinical evidence of AS but no molecular diagnosis, despite having been subjected to  extensive candidate gene analyses. The probands were screened by whole  exome sequencing (WES) using the Nextera Rapid Capture kit on a Next   Seq500 platform. All exons of AS genes were adequately covered. Results: Analysis of variants within AS genes identified pathogenic muta   tions in all families. In Family 1, we identified an homozygous 24 bp in  frame deletion in COL4A3 (p.Val11_Leu18del), segregating with autosomal  recessive AS. The variant is predicted to disrupt the signal peptide, possibly  altering COL4A3 protein secretion. In Family 2 proband, a COL4A5 hemi   zygous missense mutation (p.Gly491Asp) was found in exon 33, which was not covered by previous targeted resequencing.

2619,382, Role of miRNAs in the etiology of alopecia areata: A genome wide miRNA association analysis,P04.007,,"Background: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common hair loss disorder charac  terized by a sudden onset of patchy areas of hair loss, which can occur on the scalp or elsewhere on the body. Immunological and genetic association studies support the hypothesis that AA is autoimmune in nature. Recent evi dence points to a significant role of miRNAs in autoimmune diseases;but the role of miRNAs in AA has not been investigated so far.Methods: We performed a systematic analysis to investigate whether com mon variantsamong all known autosomal microRNAs loci contribute to AA development. Gene based analyses were performed by VEGAS for all miRNAs listed in miRBase and their flanking sequences using the largest GWAS data set of 3,253 patients and 7,543 controls.Result: As a result, 78 of the 617 investigated microRNAs showed nominally significant p values. After correction for multiple testing, three microRNAs (miR 1237, miR 30b/d, miR 548h 2) showed significant association with AA. The most promising one was miR 30B.Target gene analyses for 3 di sease associated microRNAs revealed 2,072 nominally significant predicted target genes. Gene based p values were calculated for the predicted target genes revealing 42 of them to be significantly associated with AA after cor   rection for multiple testing,including IL2RA, ERBB3 as genome wide signi ficant loci from former AA GWA studies. By luciferase assays, we validated the site specific regulation of IL2RA, STX17 and TNXBof miR 30B.Conclusion: Our study is the first to suggest the importance of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of AA which could be of interest for development of the rapies in the future.",2016.0,,"A.

Molecular karyotyping by SNP/oligonucleotide mi  croarray (resolution: >1kbp) was used to analyze 300 children with ID, au   tism spectrum disorders and congenital malformations. Results. Cytogenetically visible 2q37 deletions were detected in 2 cases.  Molecular karyotyping confirmed the presence of these deletions (5Mb and 8.5Mb). Furthermore, a CNV within 2q37.3 (44kbp) leading to HDAC4 loss was detected in a patient. All affected female patients had ID, autism and  minor ear anomalies. One had widely set nipples and hypotonia. Another  one had a short statue. Two patients presented with ocular hypertelorism. HDAC4 haploinsufficiency was observed in all three cases. Conclusions. We show that 2q37 deletions can be common in children with  ID, autism, congenital malformations tending to a frequency as high as 1%.

2663,686,"Efficacy of GenIDA, a family oriented international online registry and clinical database for genetic forms of intellectual disability and/or autism, to collect medically relevant information on the Koolen de Vries Syndrome",P08.52,,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are over   lapping disorders that constitute a major public health problem with a cu  mulated frequency of about 2.5%. Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen   tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members.Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen   de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy   potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website.This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare diseases affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce   phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial   ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60  and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense  PUF60  mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked  coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60  and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced  different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome.We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty   ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four  nucleotides in PUF60  (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p.I136Tfs*31).

The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome. The  case illustrates the strength of exome sequencing in deciphering the genetic basis of diseases.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.",2016.0,,"M.

2671,706, Copy number variation in RBFOX1 and DOCK8: Neurodevelopmental disorders or benign variants?,P08.74,,"Deletions and duplications involving the genes RBFOX1 and DOCK8 have been implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disor   ders (ASD). However, the clinical significance of these CNVs is controversial. We analysed 14 RBFOX1 deletions (20 309 kb), six RBFOX1 duplications (34 kb to 1.34 Mb), and eight DOCK8 deletions (22 227 kb) from unrelated individuals. Our analysis revealed that five DOCK8 deletions were terminal and three were interstitial. Two deletions lie within intron 1, two include only exon 1, and four include multiple exons. Thirteen of the RBFOX1 de   letions lie within a single intron; deletion of intron 3 and intron 4 are the most common. Though the clinical information provided is limited, seven individuals with RBFOX1 deletions have a diagnosis of ASD. The clinical si gnificance of duplications is difficult to interpret since intragenic gains can lead to loss of function, whereas whole gene duplication can lead to triplo sensitivity. Half of the RBFOX1 duplications have one breakpoint upstream of the gene and one breakpoint in intron 2, which is predicted to maintain the reading frame if the duplications are in direct tandem orientation. One RBFOX1 duplication lies entirely within intron 3 and two include only exon 4, which could lead to an out of frame transcript. Our analysis sheds light on the genomic structures of small CNVs implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Only two CNVs had identical breakpoints, suggesting diversity in RBFOX1 and DOCK8 rearrangements rather than a few common variants. However, the clinical significance of these CNV remains unclear since all CNVs we included were inherited.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  173Back to index",2016.0,,"S.

2680,743, The power of New Generation Sequencing in identifying mutations in non specific ASD ID phenotypes: the example of SHANK3,P09.019,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by im  pairments in reciprocal social communication and stereotyped behaviors.  Intellectual Disability (ID) frequently coexists with these two core sym  ptoms. Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3  concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo  derate to profound ID. SHANK3  haploinsufficiency is frequently associated  with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs  to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing  of this gene.Materials and Methods: Here we report on 2 boys with ASD and ID and a girl  with severe ID associated with a SHANK3  mutation found by next generation  sequencing (NGS) study (Illumina). Results: Two of these mutations are truncated and de novo involving the  exon 21 in the prolin rich domain (NM_001080420.1:c.2955_2970dup  (p.(Pro992Arg*325) and NM_001080420.1:c.4381C>T (p.(Gln1461*)).

Conclusion: The retrospective clinical examination of these patients did not  permit to distinct specific signs, which highlights the phenotypic hetero  geneity of these patients. Given the scarcity of variants involving SHANK3 ,  the unsystematic presence of the distinctive clinical features of Phelan Mc  Dermid Syndrome, a NGS approach by panel or exome seems more justified  than a targeted sequencing approach of SHANK3  in this phenotype.",2016.0,,"A.

Overall, CNV transmitting parents did not differ significantly in BAPQ and  SRS scores from non transmitting parents. However, independent analyses of relative pairs revealed a significant difference in BAPQ global (t, 2.18; ad  justed P,.032), BAPQ aloofness domain (t, 2.61; adjusted P,.032) and SRS  scores (t, 2.03; adjusted P,.047) between mothers transmitting and mo thers not transmitting etiological CNVs to their affected sons. Our findings  indicate that mothers presenting personality traits in the broader autism  phenotype are frequently carriers of pathogenic CNVs that they transmit to their ASD sons. The results from the analyses of maternal phenotype and CNV transmission patterns to sons support previous reports of maternal  transmission bias to male offspring, and the prevalent hypothesis of a high  er genetic risk tolerance in females due to putative protective factors.

2696,769, Structural chromosome 21 specific instability in the diseased brain,P09.046,," Introduction. Chromosome 21 aneuploidy has been shown to affect the di  seased brain especially in individuals with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD). Howe  ver, structural chromosome 21 specific instability has never been a target  for molecular (neuro)cytogenetic studies of the diseased brain. Here, we have addressed chromosome 21 structural variations in single cells of the  AD, schizophrenia and autism brain as well as in the unaffected brain. Materials and Methods. Ten AD, 18 schizophrenia, 12 autism and 20 age  and sex matched samples of the postmortem brain (frontal cortex, Brod   mann area 10) were studied by interphase chromosome specific multicolor  banding (ICS MCB) and NeuN  immunohistochemistry. Results. We were able to show that rare recurrent rearrangements of chro mosome 21 or structural chromosome 21 specific instabilities are found al   most exclusively in the AD brain. These were isochromosomes 21q, 21q22 >qter losses and chromosome 21 breaks at 21q21 and 21q22 affecting 0.6 3.7% of cells. NeuN immunohistochemistry has indicated that the instability  randomly affects NeuN positive and NeuN negative cell nuclei in contrast to  chromosome 21 breaks, which were more prevalent in NeuN positive cell  nuclei.Conclusions. Our data suggests that chromosome 21 specific instability is able to contribute to the AD pathogenesis. One can hypothesize chromoso   me 21 breaks confined to NeuN positive cells of the AD brain to result from the dysregulation of DNA replication/reparation or DNA damage response pathways.

It usually affects boys, but also there are girls affected. Duplication could be de novo or inherited from asymptomatic carrier mother. It has been reported about 120 cases all over the world, wi thout a known incidence.The aim of the study is to characterize a Spanish cohort with MECP2 dupli cation syndrome to improve our knowledge of the disease and perform a genotype phenotype correlation.Material and Method: The cohort consists in 13 patients of both sexes dia gnosed in different Spanish hospitals. The duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array. The clinical characterization was carried out using a checklist designed for the project. The molecular characterization is di vided into several steps: 1) Checking the duplication by qPCR doses, stu dy XCI and FISH; 2) If FISH shows tandem duplication, we narrowed the breakpoints through qPCR, PCR long and Sanger sequencing; 3) Analyze the expression of the two MeCP2 isoforms by RT qPCR.Results: In this collaborative study has been characterized a heterogeneous cohort, with both sexes, with different phenotypes (Rett like and duplicati   on patients) and inherited or de novo duplication located in different regi ons (tandem, other region of ChrX or ChrY).

2718,855, A French collaborative study of genotype phenotype relationships in 78 patients carried a 22q13,P09.140,,"Patients with Phelan McDermid Syndrome, (or 22q13.3 deletion syndrome)  often have intellectual disability (ID), language impairment and autism. SHANK3 is one of the genes that contribute to the phenotype. There is a high clinical heterogeneity and the genotype phenotype correlation is still unclear. Our French collaborative study aims to precise it and look for poten  tial modifying genetic factors. We reported genetic and phenotypic data from 78 patients, 73 carried a 22q13.3 deletion and 5 had a duplication ranging in size from 45.8 kb to 9.10 Mb. The neonatal period revealed mild motor developmental delay in deleted  carriers. All patients exhibited language disorder and 50% had no verbal  communication. Autistic traits were reported in 50% of cases, unfortunate ly, objective tests were available only for three patients. Most patients had intellectual deficiency and medical comorbidity were also noted. Long term  follow up of two patients showed motor regression and acute psychiatric  disorder episode at adulthood.Patients with duplication had language di  sturbance and three presented with autistic traits.We studied the correlation between the size of the deleted segments and the main clinical features. We also analyzed the presence of other CNVs affecting  gene coding sequences to detect potential Ã¢ÂÂsecond hitÃ¢ÂÂ implicated in the cli  nical heterogeneity of the syndrome. Interestingly, 2 patients with deletion had also a CNV at 16p11.2 involved in ASD, ID and obesity.Based on the results of this pilot study, we aim to extend this research to  other European and International centers to identify factors that modulate  the severity of the disorder.",2016.0,,"A.

2722,925, First familial case of Angelman syndrome in Bulgaria,P11.012,,"Introduction: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by genetic defects leading to loss of expression of the maternal copy of the chromosome 15q11 13 imprinted region. Most cases are sporadic, being caused by de novo deletion of maternal chromosome 15q11 13 or by paternal uniparental disomy. Familial cases can occur, due to mutations in the UBE3A gene or in the imprinting center.Materials and Methods: We describe two sibs with mental retardation, ab   sence of speech, and typical facial dysmorphism. The family members were screened by MS MLPA probemix ME028 B2 Prader Willi/Angelman for copy number variations and assessment of methylation profile. Both child  ren MS MLPA profiles were compared with their parents and 3 normal con  trols.Results: The test for methylation revealed missing SNRPN methylation spe  cific fragments in the patients profile in comparison to their parents and  normal controls, which is compatible with paternal non methylated frag ments and deleted or wrong methylated maternal fragments. The copy number test did not show deletion of the SNRPN specific fragments, but two  other fragments, corresponding to AS SRO region (part of the PWS AS im  printing center) were deleted. The deletion was detected in both affected children and it was inherited from the asymptomatic mother. Conclusion: The missing SNRPN methylation specific fragments correspond  to wrong methylation (demethylation) on the maternal allele due to deleti on of the PWS AS imprinting center. This mistake in the methylation profile  in both affected children affects maternal copy, while in the asymptomatic  mother most probably the deletion affects the paternal copy, hence non pathogenic.",2016.0,,"B.

2736,1043, Spectrum of pathogenic variants and clinical characterisation of a representative cohort of Czech patients with RASopathies,P11.135,,"Introduction: RASopathies represent a group of clinically and molecularly intersecting disorders comprising the Noonan syndrome (NS), NS with mul   tiple lentigines (NSML), Noonan like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH), CBL mutation associated syndrome, cardio facio cutaneous syndro me (CFCS), Costello syndrome (CS), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Le   gius syndrome (LS). These clinical entities are due to pathogenic variants in RAS/MAPK signalling pathway genes. Overlap of phenotypic features makes  clinical diagnosis challenging, while molecular genetic analysis fosters etio  logical diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Targeted analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, RIT1,  BRAF, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, HRAS, SHOC2, CBL, RRAS, SPRED1  and NF1 by  Sanger  and/or HaloPlex enrichment assay (Agilent Technologies, USA) fol  lowed by next generation sequencing (MiSeq platform; Illumina, USA) in a  representative group of 162 unrelated Czech cases with clinically diagnosed  NS or related disorders, excluding NF1 and LS, was performed. Results: Altogether, pathogenic variants were found in 69 (42.6%) of all cases and NS confirmed in 59 patients.

Molecular and clinical data from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations from other centers were also collected, focusing on developmental aspects and the associated epilepsy phenotype. A review of SYNGAP1 mutations published in the lite rature was also performed.Results: We describe 17 unrelated affected individuals carrying 13 diffe rent novel loss of function SYNGAP1 mutations. Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1 related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviors in eight patients. Hypotonia and unstable gait were frequent as sociated neurological features. With the exception of one patient who ex   perienced a single seizure, all patients had epilepsy, characterized by falls or head drops due to atonic or myoclonic seizures, (myoclonic) absences, and/or eyelid myoclonia. Triggers of seizures were frequent (n,7). Seizures were pharmacoresistant in half of the patients. The severity of the epilepsy did not correlate with the presence of autistic features or with the severity of cognitive impairment. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, but spared spliced 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons.

Molecular and clinical data from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations from other centers were also collected, focusing on developmental aspects and the associated epilepsy phenotype. A review of SYNGAP1 mutations published in the lite rature was also performed.Results: We describe 17 unrelated affected individuals carrying 13 diffe rent novel loss of function SYNGAP1 mutations. Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1 related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviors in eight patients. Hypotonia and unstable gait were frequent as sociated neurological features. With the exception of one patient who ex   perienced a single seizure, all patients had epilepsy, characterized by falls or head drops due to atonic or myoclonic seizures, (myoclonic) absences, and/or eyelid myoclonia. Triggers of seizures were frequent (n,7). Seizures were pharmacoresistant in half of the patients. The severity of the epilepsy did not correlate with the presence of autistic features or with the severity of cognitive impairment. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, but spared spliced 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons. Seizures in patients with mutations in exons 4 5 were more pharmacoresponsive than in patients with mutations in exons 8 15.Conclusion: SYNGAP1 encephalopathy is characterized by early neurodeve lopmental delay typically preceding the onset of a relatively recognizable epilepsy comprising generalized seizures (absences, myoclonic jerks) and frequent triggers.",2016.0,,"C.

2748,1127, Field synopsis of genetic variation and colorectal cancer: unified 2016 update,P12.065,,"Background: According to current predictions of global demographic chan  ges, the WHO estimates a 77% increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and 80% increase in CRC related deaths by 2030 (Bray et al., 2012). Iden tifying genetic variants that influence susceptibility to disease potentially can inform the development of approaches for primary and secondary pre vention. Two groups have published field synopses on genetic variants as sociated with CRC, in JNCI in 2012 and Gut in 2013. These groups are now working together on an update.Methods: We have searched all published (and some unpublished) genetic association data  including candidate gene and GWAS  for CRC to the end of 2015. Furthermore, we have access to 4 GWAS datasets. We are conducting meta analyses. We have reached a consensus on the operationalization of the Venice guidelines on the credibility of genetic association, which had dif   fered between the two previous field synopses.Results: More than 200 genes in about 770 SNPs were identified as putative ly associated with CRC. For 450 SNPs, there was a single study only; for 90 SNPs, two studies; and for 230 SNPs, 3 or more studies. Meta analysis will be carried out for SNPs with 3 or more studies, and credibility of association assessed according to the Venice criteria.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  272Back to index Conclusions: The identification of genetic variants with influence on CRC  risk may reflect an importance of genes involved in colorectal cancer risk.

2757,1226, A Hot spot of In frame Duplications Activates the Oncoprotein AKT1 in Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumors,P12.172,,"Ovarian granulosa cell tumors are the most common sex cord stromal tu   mors and have juvenile (JGCTs) and adult forms. The molecular basis of JG   CTs is poorly understood although mutations in the GNAS gene have been reported but only in 30% of the analyzed JGCTs. We have searched for alte rations in other proteins involved in ovarian mitogenic signaling. This led us to detect in frame duplications within the oncogene AKT1 in >60% of the JGCTs studied and point mutations affecting highly conserved residues in tumors without duplications. Subcellular localization analyses of the muta   ted proteins and functional explorations using Western blot and luciferase assays showed that AKT1 variants bearing the duplications located at the plasma membrane and were hyperactive. To gain insights into the effects of these mutations and the existence of potential co driver alterations, we per formed transcriptome of four JGCTs. RNA Seq data analyses showed that the duplications were the sole lesions common to the four tumors suggesting a causative role. They also pinpointed a series of differentially expressed genes, involved in cytokine and hormone signaling and cell division related processes. Our results suggested that most of the transcriptomic dysregula   tion might be mediated by a limited set of transcription factors perturbed by AKT1 activation. Finally, we show that commercially available AKT inhi bitors can modulate the in vitro activity of various mutated forms. Our study incriminates somatic AKT1 mutations as a major event in the pathogenesis of JGCTs and provide therapeutic leads for a targeted treatment.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  296Back to index",2016.0,,"A.

While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver  Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis   order 1 were identified.

Building on the TaqMan based Rare Mutation assay set for detection of rare  mutations using digital PCR on the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System, we are now developing multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of several mutations. We selected relevant mutations in the EGFR and KRAS genes for  our initial multiplex application: EGFR G719, EGFR exon 19 deletions, and  KRAS G12/G13. These mutations may have implications for potential future targeted therapy. Methods: Primers and probes of singleplex Rare Mutation Assays were re  formulated to generate multiplex assays detecting the EGFR and KRAS mu tations. All multiplex assays were tested on template composed of wild type  genomic DNA background mixed with mutant plasmid reflecting each of the  mutations detected by the multiplex assays.Summary: Initial experimental results were successful and showed excel lent signal intensity and clear cluster separation when analyzed with the  QuantStudio 3D AnalysisSuiteÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Cloud Software.

Interpreting such predictions for individual genomes is nontrivial and re sults are typically obtained with proprietary software that is not publicly available. In non clinical settings, 23andme and other private companies have led the charge in providing direct to consumer genetic testing, re sulting in more than one million individuals being genotyped to date. This explosion of genetic data motivated us to develop an easy to install open source platform for polygenic trait and disease risk prediction. The plat   form is developed with both clinical and non clinical settings in mind. It implements three main computational steps: 1) imputation, 2) ancestry inference, and 3) genetic prediction. Through careful choice of algorithms and efficient implementation, the whole pipeline can be applied to a 23and   me genotype in about one minute, ensuring an interactive user experience for all of the three steps. To demonstrate how the application can be used in practice, we provide an online implementation (http://thehonestgene.github.io), where users can upload their 23andme genotypes and obtain polygenic predictions for height and BMI. The polygenic risk prediction is carried out using LDpred weights, which are trained on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. To estimate the accuracy of the predictions we used self reported height and BMI from 609 Danish high school students as validation data. The prediction R2 in the sample after adjusting for age, sex, and the first ten PCs was 25% for height and 11% for BMI.",2016.0,,"B. J. Vilhjalmsson, U. Seren, G. Athanasiadis, G. Bhatia, J.

2784,1440, Integrative Computational Pathogenicity Testing of GWAS Loci Asserted the important role of CCR2 gene in the Celiac Disease,P16.17,,"Celiac disease (CD) is a gluten intolerance disorder with underlying genetic influences. Recent fine mapping and European GWAS studies identified 57  non HLA CD susceptible loci, majority of which are non coding variants and  with no annotated function. So, we undertook the integrative computatio   nal approach to uncover plausible mechanisms connecting these CD specific  loci to the disease pathology. At first, 1,008 linked variants (r2 Ã¢ÂÂ¥0.8) of 57 CD lead loci were ranked from deleterious to benign using CADD, GWAVA, and  FATHMM algorithms. The mRNA levels of highest deleteriously ranked ge  nes were tested in gene expression profiles of intestinal tissues and lympho  cyte data. Pathway analysis was done to identify potential pathways influen cing highly deleterious CD loci. We found that 2% (22 variants in 13 genes) were highly deleterious (Rank I) and 4.3% of 1065 CD variants (22 variants in 29 genes) were deleterious (Rank II). By concordant gene expression and pathway analysis we identified that deleterious SNPs localized in CCR2 gene may influence its expression and elicit cascade of immunological events associated with intestinal gluten intolerance. This study demonstrates the utility of integrative annotations, gene expression and pathway analysis for filtering the potential CD relevant variants from a large scale genomics data.",2016.0,,"N. A.

The proposed statistical framework (Decon2) consists of two components: 1) Decon cell, that estimates cell counts using molecular profiling data (e.g. expression data or methylation results obtained from heterogeneous samples) and 2) Decon eQTL, which subsequently deconvolutes the overall eQTL effect into cell type specific eQTL effects.We observed that estimated cell counts obtained with Decon cell agree very well with the measurements determined experimentally. The correlation coefficient between predicted and measured cell/tissue proportion range from 0.75 to 0.99 using 9 different datasets. Subsequently we applied De   con eQTL to whole blood RNA seq and cell count data obtained from 626 individuals.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have become a powerful tool to  disclose new molecular mechanisms of complex diseases. However, the de   velopment of new therapies based on these findings is hampered by additio   nal hurdles i.e. causal gene mapping and target efficacy & feasibility. We have developed a new gene prioritization approach using weighted  scores for target gene feasibility, function, specificity & novelty. Each score is derived from multiple sub scores which again can be weighted according to specific requirements. We applied this approach to a recent GWAS for Schizophrenia (SZ) including 108 loci.Causal gene mapping has been parameterized by using the number of co ding genes per loci as an inverse estimate for target feasibility. As additional sub score for this dimension we applied the gene protein product class and the homology to model organisms. Gene function has been parameterized by GWAS significance & literature evidence. Target specificity has been de   rived from genome wide expression datasets in different sub categories (brain vs. periphery, cell type specific and pattern in cortical sub regions). Target novelty has been estimated from the inverse number of SZ related publications.The combined scores with flexible weighting allows interactive ranking of the 340 coding genes. Using default weight parameters predicts some well known SZ target genes at top ranks i.e. CACNB2 (#1), DRD2 (#2) or GRM3 (#10).

Many environmental and intrinsic factors are linked with gut microbiome, with both one way causa tions (age, gender) and reciprocal relations (BMI, blood lipid level, medi   cation). It was shown earlier that some bacteria inhabiting human gut are  heritable, so the human genome can influence the microbiome.

For each individual, both genotyping  (Immunochip, Illumina) and metagenomic sequencing (paired end Illumina  reads) were performed. The preprocessing of the microbiome data included QC control and filtering from human DNA followed by MetaPhlAn2.2 map ping.

Output is a subset of SNPs along with their predicted effects on TF binding. This sub set is then used in GWAS studies to identify various kinds of cis regulatory QTLs. Unlike other approaches, our pipeline can identify de novo created TF binding sites not present in the reference genome.Results: To test the pipeline we selected 48 TFs and extracted a list of 248,676 SNPs affecting TF binding.

Variability in functional outcome after ischemic stroke can be influenced by many factors. Irrespective of clinical factors such as age, stroke subtype, vascular stenosis, location of the injury and size of the affected area, inter individual variation in neuronal recovery is considerable. A number of me tabolic pathways are involved in the cerebral ischemic damage response and their activity may be modulated by variation in the genes that encode their various components. Our aim was to identify genetic variants and genes in fluencing the recovery process.We conducted a meta analysis of four different genome wide association studies. We included 1193 anterior territorial ischemic stroke Spanish cases with modified Rankin functional Scale measures at 3 months after stroke. Peripheral blood cell DNA was genotyped using the Illumina HumanCore Exome 24 BeadChip. Association analyses with outcome at 3 months after ischemic stroke were performed using SNPTEST and meta analyzed with METAL. Data was adjusted for clinical severity at discharge measured by Na tional Institute of Health Stroke Scale, hypertension, age, gender and princi   pal components. Imputation was done using IMPUTE2.We discovered three genetic variants associated with 3 months outcome af ter ischemic stroke located in the INADL gene (<5.3E 08).We have identified a potential loci suggestive of being relevant for functio nal outcome and the recovery process after stroke.

GWAS studies for longevity have found only two robustly replicating SNPs in and near APOE and FOXO3. Recent literature has improved power by  looking at subsets of SNPs associated with specific diseases (Fortney et al,  PLOS Genetics, Dec 2015). We improve on previous work in various aspects: (i) combined together the two largest longevity GWAS meta analysis studies  ; (ii) used a large panel (190 studies) of genome wide association summary  statistics and applied Mendelian Randomization to compute a causal esti mate of various traits/diseases on longevity. For example, using the top 15 (independent) LDL increasing SNPs we estimate that high LDL levels reduce  the chance to live longer than 90 years ( 0.24 log odds / LDL SD unit, with  p<3e 15).For each SNP we built priors for longevity effect by combining the SNPÃ¢ÂÂs ef  fect on different diseases and the causal effect of these diseases on longevity.  This way pleiotropic SNPs with even with small impact on individual traits can gain solid prior strength. We then calculated the Bayes factor for each  marker and found that several loci gained genome wide significance thanks  to the informative prior. Furthermore, our approach allowed for dissecting longevity heritability to genetic factors that act through the examined di seases and those that do not.

2816,1597, Association between INADL polymorphisms and ischemic stroke functional outcome through genome wide association meta analysis,P18.050,,"Cerebrovascular disease is one of the leading causes of disability in adults. Variability in functional outcome after ischemic stroke can be influenced by many factors. Irrespective of clinical factors such as age, stroke subtype, vascular stenosis, location of the injury and size of the affected area, inter individual variation in neuronal recovery is considerable. A number of me tabolic pathways are involved in the cerebral ischemic damage response and their activity may be modulated by variation in the genes that encode their various components. Our aim was to identify genetic variants and genes in fluencing the recovery process.We conducted a meta analysis of four different genome wide association studies. We included 1193 anterior territorial ischemic stroke Spanish cases with modified Rankin functional Scale measures at 3 months after stroke. Peripheral blood cell DNA was genotyped using the Illumina HumanCore Exome 24 BeadChip. Association analyses with outcome at 3 months after ischemic stroke were performed using SNPTEST and meta analyzed with METAL. Data was adjusted for clinical severity at discharge measured by Na tional Institute of Health Stroke Scale, hypertension, age, gender and princi   pal components. Imputation was done using IMPUTE2.We discovered three genetic variants associated with 3 months outcome af ter ischemic stroke located in the INADL gene (<5.3E 08).We have identified a potential loci suggestive of being relevant for functio nal outcome and the recovery process after stroke. Follow up studies are warranted to validate these findings in other populations and to establish whether INADL can be a novel therapeutic target for the rehabilitation stra tegies.

2818,1603, Genetic network as post GWAS analysis approach for correlated complex phenotypes: example on infectious diseases,P18.058,,"Background: Due to the rigorous genome wide significance threshold in GWA studies, causative common low risk polymorphisms for complex phe notypes may be missed. We propose building a genetic network as post GWAS approach to provide an insight into the role of host genetics in infec tious disease pathogenesis from the 10,001 Dalmatians biobank.Materials and methods: We included 1,998 participants representing iso   lated island populations and 1,012 participants from mainland population. GWAS with meta analyses was performed for 11 infection related pheno types. Genotypic correlations between each phenotype associated SNPs from GWAS were used for network construction and enrichment analysis. We also searched for the overlap between correlated infectious phenotypes to find shared core genes and pathways.Results: Three genes reached a genome wide significance threshold   HA   PLN1 for meningitis in all cohorts, while IPMK for tuberculosis and TTC39B for hepatitis in island cohorts. Genetic network additionally revealed genes ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  382Back to index DCN and CORIN to be marginally significant for tuberculosis, DMD for hepa  titis and GALNT18 for systemic infections. Pathway analysis also revealed  enrichment in genes outside of the immune system that may have plausible  functions in various infection related outcomes.Conclusions: Network analysis can be a favourable post GWAS approach,  especially to elucidate shared genes among correlated complex phenotypes.  Some variants in infectious diseases may be wide spread, while others could be a result of genetic drift and isolation and possibly even local co adaptation.

2820,1609, Investigating the genetic control of kidney function of individuals in the Scottish population,P18.064,,"Measures of urine electrolytes provide useful information on kidney func tion in people and are used routinely by clinicians as biomarkers of kidney damage. Genome wide association scans to identify significant loci asso   ciations in these traits will give some indication of the underlying genetics which potentially will provide useful insights into kidney disease aetiology.We therefore performed a mixed model GWAS on 2934 individuals which formed part of a larger cohort of individuals genotyped in the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study. We analysed 8 phenotypes consi   sting of measures of urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, chlorides, calcium, glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, and urine osmolarity. We further estimated whole genome and regional heritabilities for these phenotypes using GCTA and REACTA.We report a GWAS significant SNP (rs4574243, p value , 9.378709e 09) close to the RBMS3 gene on chromosome 3 associated with urine calcium concentration. The remaining traits had significant SNP associations at a suggestive level (p value < 1e 06) but not reaching GWAS significance. The regional heritability results in most of the traits mirrored their GWAS re sults by showing significant estimates on chromosomes with GWAS hits. The heritability estimates were very low for all the traits suggesting that these traits are under modest genetic control.The SNP hits identified for these traits lie within areas of the genome that have genes close by (<1Mb) which presents a useful avenue to be explored in future studies. There have been very sparse GWAS reports on these traits which make these findings uniquely important.",2016.0,,"R. F. Oppong, O. Devuyst, C. Hayward, P . Navarro, C. S. Haley, S.

2823,1616, A comprehensive genome wide analysis of melanoma Breslow thickness identifies interaction between CDC42 and SCIN genes,P18.072,,"Breslow thickness (BT) is a major prognostic factor of cutaneous melano ma, the most fatal skin cancer. The genetic component of BT has only been explored by candidate gene studies with inconsistent results. Our objective ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  385Back to index was to uncover the genetic factors underlying BT using a hypothesis free  genome wide approach.Our analysis strategy integrated a genome wide association study (GWAS) for BT followed by pathway analysis of GWAS outcomes using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method and epistasis analysis within BT asso   ciated pathways. This strategy was applied to two large melanoma datasets with Hapmap3 imputed SNP data (~1 million SNPs): the French MELARISK study for discovery (966 cases) and the MD Anderson Cancer Center study (1,546 cases) for replication.While no marginal effect of individual SNPs was revealed through GWAS, three pathways, defined by gene ontology (GO) categories were significantly enriched in genes associated with BT (False Discovery Rate Ã¢ÂÂ¤5% in both studies): hormone activity, cytokine activity and myeloid cell differentiation. Epistasis analysis, within each significant pathway, identified a statistically significant interaction between CDC42 and SCIN SNPs (P interaction ,2.2x10  6, which met the overall multiple testing corrected threshold of 2.5x10 6).  These two SNPs (and proxies) are strongly associated with CDC42 and SCIN  gene expression levels and map to regulatory elements in skin cells.In conclusion, this study identified two novel genes influencing Breslow thickness. This finding has important biological relevance since CDC42 and SCIN proteins have opposite effects in actin dynamics, a key mechanism un derlying melanoma cell migration and invasion.Funding: INCa_5982; PHRC_AOM 07 195; FRM_FDT20130928343; NIH_R01CA100264",2016.0,,"A.

2846,1864, Primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with severe intellectual disability and abnormal brain MRI findings in a patient with 3q29 microduplication syndrome A case report,P08.20,,"Introduction: Chromosome interstitial 3q29 microduplication syndrome (OMIM 611936) has been associated with a recognizable pattern of ab   normalities such as mild to moderate cognitive impairment, cerebral palsy, speech delay, autistic traits, seizures, obesity, musculoskeletal anomalies (chest wall and fingers deformities) and common craniofacial dysmorphic features.Materials and method: We have investigated a 34 year old woman with severe intellectual disability, abnormal brain MRI findings suggestive for fronto temporal dementia and primary immunodeficiency characterized through persistent mucosal infections with Candida albicans. Results of EEG, karyotype, cerebral fluid analyses, abdominal ultrasound and urine/plasma metabolic screens were normal.DNA isolated and purified from peripheral venous blood was further as sessed by array CGH platform (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI, USA) using  an Array CHX 3x720k slide. Copy number data was analyzed with Nexus 6.1  software (Nexus BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA).Results:   Assessment through Array CGH identified 1.65 Mb duplication at  3q29. The duplicated region encompasses 29 genes including several prote  in coding genes such as RNF168, WDR53, TFRC, PIGX, PAK2, NCBP2, PIGZ, MFI2, BDH1, FBXO45 or DLG1 and a non coding mRNA: mir4797 Conclusions: We described a case with typical 3q29 microduplication syn  drome with severe phenotype. To our knowledge, thus is the first case with primary immunodeficiency features and expands the heterogeneous clini cal spectrum of this syndrome. Consideration should be given to the above  mentioned locus (3q29) in patients with recurrent fungal infections, intel  lectual disability and/or abnormal brain MRI findings.Acknowledgement: This study was supported within the frame of European  Social Found, Human Resources Development Operational Program 2007  2013, project no.

Our aim was to analyze, by CGH arrays, a series of patients affected by several neurological diseases and/or malformations to try to determine the etiology of the disease in these patients.Methods: A total of 66 pediatric index patients with normal karyotype were analyzed for Copy Number Variations by CGH arrays using CGXÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 8 plex (Agilent Technologies). Proband patients were clinically classified as: au   tism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n,30), intellectual disability (n,17), mal   formation syndromes (n,9), psychomotor delay (n,8), hypotonia (n,1) and early puberty (n,1).Results: 10 pathogenic (or probably pathogenic) variants and 21 variants of unknown significance were detected. Pathogenic or probably pathogenic variants were identified in 3 patients with psychomotor delay (and other features), 3 patients with intellectual disability, 3 patients with ASD and in one patient with hypotonia and malformations. 6 of the 10 variants were previously described and associated to known syndromes (Prader Willi syndrome (n,1), 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome (n,1), 16p11.2 microde   letion syndrome (n,1), 22q11 deletion syndrome (n,2), and a tetrasomy of 15q11.2 region (n,1)).Discussion and conclusions: Array CGH is a rapid and cost effective techni   que for postnatal screening of unknown syndromes, intellectual disability and autism sprectrum disorders.

2862,1933, Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome: a case report,P11.24,,"Introduction: Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNNS) is a congenital neu rocutaneous disorder with linear epidermal nevus. LNNS is a rare sporadic disease (<1:10.000).Case report: we report a 10 years boy with nevi on left side of face and mid line of neck. Family history was negative. He had refractory partial seizures and developmental delay. Brain MNR showed hemimegalencephaly. EEG had epileptiform bursts. There were retinal anomalies, coloboma, severe ocular hemangiomas and kyphoscoliosis. A diagnosis of LNSS was conside   red. Excisional biopsy of nevus confirmed diagnosis of verrucous epidermal nevus with sebaceous anomalies.Conclusion: LNNS manifestations include linear epidermal nevus, seizures (75%), developmental delays (40%), ocular and skeletal involvement. This rare disease is hypothesized to result from postzygotic mosaic mutations in HRAS or KRAS genes. Isolated congenital sebaceous nevi are more frequent (1:1000). The risk of association with other organ involvement is greater when typical midline nevus has been identified. LNNS is a serious disease, because of cosmetic impact, malignant potential and severity of clinical ma nifestations. This case showes a very serious expression of LNNS, because of the organs involvement is in a very severe form. The diagnosis is difficult and late. It makes us think about the importance of early diagnosis and all children with a suspected diagnosis of LNSS should undergo a multidiscipli nary follow up.ReferencesABSTRACTS ELECTRONIC POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  454Back to index 1.

A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ï¬uence genetic risk. I.M.

In patients with a speci ï¬c phenotype, the identi ï¬cation of a single gene imbalance, namely a deletion, allows the identi ï¬cation of disease related genes and genotype phenotype correlations. TBL1XR1 mutations have been reported to be associated with autism, autosomal dominant mental retardation(OMIM: 616944) and Pierpont syndrome(OMIM: 602342). Only two cases with genedeletions have been reported: a single case with mild developmental delay(DD) and a 1.6 Mb de novo deletion at 3q26.31q26.32; and a familial case (mother/daughter) withmoderate intellectual disability(ID) and facial dysmorph  isms with a 708 kb deletion at 3q26.32. We report a 5Â½ year old male with global DD, growth retardation and dys morphisms with a 3q26.32 de novo deletion, being TBL1XR1 the only known coding gene within the deletion. TBL1XR1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed protein that localizes to the nucleus and plays a role in transcription mediated by nuclear receptors. TBL1XR1 mutations have also been described in autistic patients with ID. In DecipherDatabase, deletions encompassing TBL1XR1 are reported in two patients: one with a de novo deletion and autism, hearing impairment and spotty hyperpigmentation, and theother with a partial de novo deletion of the gene but other genomic imbalances.

2899,237, A novel KDM6B gene de novo mutation in two siblings with a variable neurocognitive phenotype,P08.29,,"Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Praha 5   Motol, Czech Republic Introduction: The clinical  and genetic heterogeneity of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) poses a signi ï¬cant diagnostic challenge. Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ï¬rst line diag  nostic  and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22  and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con  ï¬rmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme  thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ï¬ed a thirdâmutation âinKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ï¬ndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

Monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders which showed autistic behavior patterns have sugges tedsynaptic dysfunction, as a key mechanism in the patho  physiology of ASD. Subsequently, genes involved in synaptic signaling have been investigated with a priority forcandidategene studies. A synaptosomal associated protein 25(SNAP25) gene plays a crucial role in the central ner  voussystem, contributing to exocytosis by targeting andfusion ofvesicles to the cell membrane. Studies have shown a correlation between aberrant expression of theSNA  P25and a varietyof brain diseases. Single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) inthis gene are associated with several psychiatric diseases, suchas bipolar, schizophrenia, and attention de ï¬cit/hyperactivitydisorder. The aim of the pre  sent study was to investigatewhether polymorphisms (rs3746544 and rs1051312) in theregulatory 3 â² untranslated region (3 â²UTR) of theSNAP25gene have an association with ASD in unrelated Iranian case(N ,524) control (N , 472) samples.

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

The occurrence of ANK2 mutation transporters in hereditary primary arrhythmia syndrome (IPAS), nevertheless, is uni dentiï¬ed in Albanian. By means of a next generation sequencer, we intended to recognize ANK2 mutations in the cohort of IPAS individuals, in whom conservative Sangersequencing not succeeded to recognize pathogenic muta  tions in main contributing genes, and to appraise the clinical features of ANK2 mutation transporters. Materials and Methods We monitored 524 probands with IPAS and investigated 42 genes counting entire ANK2 exons applying a bench top NGS (MiSeq, Illumina) orcarried out whole exome sequencing applying HiSeq2000 (Illumina). Results 10 of 524 probands (1.8%, aged 0 â55 years, 7 males) were discovered to hold 6 dissimilar heterozygous ANK2 mutations. ANK2 W1535R was recognized in 3LQTS individuals and 1 symptomatic BrS and was calcu  lated as harmful by numerous forecast software. Altogether, as to phenotype, there were 7 LQTS, 1BrS, 2 IVF.

2946,29, Precision cancer medicine: translating laboratory studies into improvements in patient care,S06.3,,"There are a number of prospective and predictive bio  markers routinely used in clinical practice for solid tumors that have an impact on patient care. Predictive biomarkers currently validated include: (i) levels of expression of hor mone receptors for the prediction of response to hormone blockade in breast cancer; (ii) HER2 expression levels for trastuzumab; (iii) C KIT mutation in the prediction of response to imatinib in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors; (iv)EGFR mutations in the response to TKI inhibitors in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); (v) EML4/ALK translocation in the response to crizotinib in NSCLC; (vi) KRAS andNRAS mutations as negative markers of response to EGFR blockade by cetuximab or panitumumab; (vii)BRAF mutations in the response to vemurafenib in advanced melanoma; (vii) BRCA germline mutation as predictor to response to PARP inhibitors in breast cancer.Critical issues in the translation of the preclinical ï¬ndings to the clinical setting include the use of robust methodologies valid in suboptimal samples with clearly de ï¬ned cut off values. Regarding the design of the clinical studies a number of characteristics must be hIghlighted: (i) the use of response rate as a preferred endpoint; (ii) the focus inadvanced diseases; (iii) preferably based in single agent studies; (iv) an adequate power (v) a well de ï¬ned timing of sample acquisition; and (vi) an independent validationpreferably in randomized trials. So far validation of gene signatures or other complex markers such as immuneinï¬ltrates has been lagging behind precluding a more widespread use of these technologies in the routine setting. Among the challenges to face in this implementation in the years to come include to accelerate the transition, to modify study design based on the lessons learnt and to promote structural changes favoring a biomarker based drug devel opment and a reimbursement of cost of biomarker analysis once its usefulness is shown.

However for CAD, acomplex diseases, GWAS âs only explain a small portion of phenotypic variance. A new proposed approach is to look at the generalized form of compound double heterozygosity(GCDH) to detect the genetic associations caused by com  pound heterozygosity(CH) and thereby aid in explaining some of the âmissing heritability â. Our study aimed to use the GCDH test to discover genetic loci associated with CH of CAD in European ancestry genetic and exome data. Methods : Our genetic sample are based on the German Myocardial Infarction Family Study V(GerMIFS V) population based study cohort which consists of 1,261 families(Men ,64.52%) whereby all cases(N cases,2,459; Ncontrols,1,611) had myocardial infarction. Our exome samples are based on the German CAD North and South Studies(Ncase|Ncontrol for North:4,464|2,886 andSouth:5,255|2,921). The CollapsABEL software tool was used, to conduct a genome wide association scan âPLINK2 was called internally   and subsequently a GCDH test wasperformed. Results : For chr1, we found 2 genetic loci to be sig  niï¬cantly associated ( â¤1.25 Ã 10 â10) with CH in CAD. Interestingly, of these, one SNP was already identi ï¬ed using theâtraditional âsingle SNP based method while the other SNP was only found by using GCDH. Remaining auto somal chromosomes and exome data are currently being analysed. Conclusions : Based on the analysis of one chromosomone, GCDH test was able to reveal a locus that was associated104with CH in CAD which could have otherwise been âmissed â using single SNP based method.

Materials and Methods: To identify genetic variants inï¬uencing obesogenic gene expression in adipose tissue, we combined expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with chromatin interaction data. We detected cis eQTLs (+/â500 kb from the TSS, FDR < 1%) using RNA  sequence data from 793 subcutaneous adipose biopsies from the Finnish METSIM cohort, and then detected distalenhancers interacting with promoters by generating pro  moter capture Hi C data in primary human white adipocytes. Results: We identi ï¬ed 10,667 adipose cis eQTL variants residing inside distal enhancers that loop to physically interact with the promoter of the eQTL and enhancer targetgene (permutation p < 0.001). To focus on genes related to obesity, we correlated the expression of the target genes with body mass index (BMI). Of 1,312 genes with loopingcis eQTLs, 54 were correlated with BMI (genome wide corrected p < 3.197 Ã 10 â6). Of these, MAP2K5 and IL20RB , are regulated by looping cis eQTLs that are LD proxies (r2> 0.80) for BMI GWAS SNPs, suggesting them as the underlying genes at these wide BMI GWAS loci. Byperforming gene gene expression correlations separately in the lean (BMI < 25, n ,118) and obese group (BMI > 30, n,118), we discovered that correlation coef ï¬cients for 34 of the 54 genes show signi ï¬cant differences between lean and obese individuals (permutation p < 0.01), implying that obesity disrupts normal correlation structure in adiposetranscriptomes among these BMI correlated genes. Conclusions: Our results uncover variants in regulatory enhancer promoter interaction circuits in ï¬uencing adipose gene expression underlying obesity. D.Z. Pan: None. K. Garske: None. A. Ko: None.

2969,200," Trans eQTL analysis in 25,000 individuals reveals clear differences between diseases in the types andnumber of causally involved biological pathways",C22.5,,"Netherlands,2Estonian Genome Center, Tartu, Estonia Understanding the role of genetic risk factors identi ï¬ed through genome wide association studies (GWAS) incomplex disease remains dif ï¬cult. For many diseases, hundreds of mostly non coding variants contribute to dis  ease risk through largely unknown molecular pathways. Toidentify these disease pathways, the eQTLGen consortium is integrating genetic and gene expression data from whole blood of >25,000 unrelated individuals, by conductingexpression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta analysis. We performed local cis  eQTL mapping for 7 million genetic variants and distal trans  eQTL mapping for >10,000 known genetic risk factors for disease. Finally, by using GWAS summary statistics for >1,000 (disease) phenotypes we calculated polygenic risk scores for each individual andcorrelated these to gene expression levels. In an intermediate analysis ( N,~18,000), we identi ï¬ed 36,730 signi ï¬cant trans  eQTLs, representing almost 20% of all tested GWAS Catalog SNPs. Trans  acting SNPs are 5.4 times as likely to also affect the expression of a cis gene. Integrating the effects from single SNPs and combineddisease risk allows for comparison of the number and the nature of molecular pathways involved in several complex diseases. For example, in ï¬ammatory bowel disease SNPs affect various pathways (such as the type 1 and type 2 interferon response and B cell receptor signalling), while the combined risk SNPs for HDL cholesterol speci ï¬cally modulate the expression level of genes known to cause familial hypercholesterolemia. In addition, preliminary108analyses suggest that the large number of blood trans  eQTLs can also be used to infer relevant associations in other tissues, and to assess which genes are likely causal for disease.

In about 15% of cases, craniosynostosis is syndromic and multiple sutures are usually affected. Most of the syndromic patients have amutation in one of FGFR genes, that affect cell signaling e.g. RAS/MAPK pathway. Patients and methods: We present clinical evaluations of 3 patients with craniosynostosis and the clinical features of Noonan syndrome. The mutation analysis in these patients was performed using classic Sanger sequencing (2pts) orpanel next generation sequencing (1pt). Results: All patients, besides typical features for Noonan syndrome, like short stature, short neck and dysmorphicfeatures, had abnormal shape of the skull. The patient with p.Ala72Ser mutation in the PTPN11 presented with scaphocephaly, ASDII and cryptorchidism. Patients withmutations (p.Thr58Ile and p.Asp153Val) in the KRAS gene had macrocephaly and developmental delay. One of them had parietal foramina, submucous cleft palate and vertebraldefect, and the other one choanal stenosis and cryptorchidism.

The deletion occurs near the end of the chromosome at a location designated q13.3.In addition to normal growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological de ï¬cits which include global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual impairment, absent or severely delayed speech, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Some people with this condition have autismor autistic like behavior that affects communication and social interaction, such as poor eye contact, sensitivity to touch, and aggressive behaviors. They may also chew onnon food items such as clothing. Less frequently, people with this condition have seizures. Patient 1: 9 year old girl patient Genetic Diseases Diagnosis referred to our center with autism like behaviors. The chromosome structure was determined as 46,XX.

2998,182, Novel WAC frameshift variant in a boy with DeSanto Shinawi syndrome revealed using whole exome sequencing,P08.33,,"1Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Charles University 2nd Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic,2Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Diagnostic and Research Unit for RareDiseases, Charles University 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic DeSanto Shinawi syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the WAC gene. It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep  set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC  related phenotype and its developmental tra  jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype  ï¬rst approach.

Here we report autistic behaviour patient with lack of speech and developmental delay that was referred for genetic testing. Both father andbrother of the proban are heterozygous carriers of beta  talasemia mutations. The patient was previously tested for Fragile X syndrome and X linked mental retardation relatedgenes were sequenced as well as whole exome sequencing was performed without detecting any relevant variants correlating with the clinical features. The only positiveresult was for HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genes predisposing to celiac disease. At the end aCGH array (180K) was per  formed and it detected 278kb duplicated region (11p14.3 /chr11: 22102205 22361578) that included the ANO5 and SLC17A6 genes. This duplication was interpreted as uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance based on the international recommendations. Second aCGH analysis with higher resolution (2,7M) was perform so we can gain additional information and eventually to clarify the previous ï¬nding. An additional duplication of 312 kb was detected in chro  mosome 15 (15q11.2), which included 4 genes: TUBGCP5 , CYFIP1 ,NIPA2 and NIPA1 (PMIDs: 28588435, 27566550). Duplication was inherited by the father who is without clinical manifestation. The 15q11.2 BP1 BP2 region is found duplicated or deleted in people with cog nitive, language, and behavioral impairmen and a variable phenotype so probably this ï¬nding is the leading cause for the clinical features in the affected child.

The worldwide prevalence of autism is increasing.However, autism prevalence is low (0.27%) in Brazil due to misdiagnosis of the disorder. Material and Methods: We report on 16 probands with ASD referred by the public health system of GoiÃ¡s. ASD assessment using Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI R), G band karyotyping, and PCR of FMR1 using Amplidex Â®kit were carried out for all patients. Chromoso  mal Microarray Analysis (CMA) using GeneChipÂ®CytoScanHDTMarray was done for patients who had normal results in karyotype and PCR. Results: The behavioral phenotypes for all participants were classi ï¬ed in the ASD according to ADI R results whose karyotypes showed neither visible numerical nor structural chromosomal aberrations. FMR1 analysis revealed two children affected by Fragile X Syndrome. CMA showed a total of 21 CNVs identi ï¬ed in 12/14 (86%) patients. A total of 13/21 pathogenic CNVs were observedin 8 patients, all located at genetic ASD hotspots, including 22q11.23, Xp22.33 (2/13), 16p11.2 (3/13), harboring no OMIM genes. However, the hotspots at 15q13.3, 15q11.2(2/13), and Xp11.23 (2/13) harbored CHRNA7 ,PWRN2 and ZNF630 genes, respectively, associated with ASD. The remaining CNVs were classi ï¬ed as having unknown clinical signi ï¬cance, distributed at loci: 2q12.2, 3p22.1, 9p21.1 (3/8), Xp22.32, Xq21.1, and Xq24.

They are caused mostly by mutations in the RAS/MAP kinase signaling pathway. According to the clinical presentation and speci ï¬c mutation, they are distributed in several subgroups. Phenotypic changes include facial dysmorphism, short stature, cardiacdefects, haematological disturbances and variable neu  ropsychiatric problems. The mutations in PTPN11 gene are most commonly presented, followed by mutations in othergenes   KRAS, HRAS. SOS1, etc. We present ten patients with clinical phenotype of Noonan syndrome. Phenotypic presentation is consistant with the diagnosis and includeshort stature, variable cardiac defects, skin and hair changes, genital anomalies in some. Facial changes include hyper  telorism, antimongoloid eye slanting, long philtrum, dentalmaloclusion, low set ears, pterigia, etc.Two of the patients had hearing impairment. Molecular analysis was performed by the NGS method including genes: NRAS, ROT1,SCHOC2, HRAS, CBL, KRAS, PTPN11, SPRED1, MAP2K1, NF1 and MAP2K2. In 60% of evaluated patients mutations in PTPN11, RAF1 and KRAS genes were found.In four patients with typical NS features no mutations were found so far. Intelectual disability varies in all patients, ranging from minor to profound. Our ï¬ndings indicate that mutation distribution in RASopathies are similar to those in other studies. Further molecular evaluation is needed in order to reveal all mutations in patients with NS.

Veltishchev Research Clinical Institute of Pediatrics, N.I. Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation,2FSBSI Â«Mental Health Research CenterÂ», Moscow, Russian Federation,3FSBEI FPE Â«Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate EducationÂ» of the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation, Moscow,Russian Federation Introduction: Chromosome and genomic rearrangements are a frequent cause of abnormal brain functioning resulting in neuropsychiatric diseases. Despite a wide variety of available data, speci ï¬c biological processes underlying abnormal neurodevelopment remain to be unmasked. Here, we have used molecular cytogenetic data to analyze speci ï¬c pathways leading to neuropsychiatric diseases in children. Materials and Methods: Conventional and molecular karyotyping was used to evaluate 427 patients with idiopathic intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, andcongenital malformations. An original bioinformatic tech  nique based on candidate process prioritization (Iourov et al., 2014; Yurov et al., 2017) was applied to pathwayenrichment among these patients. Results: Molecular cytogenetic analysis has shown CNVs relevant to a pathway functional change in 397children (93%). The highest enrichment rates (gene percentage among all the prioritized candidate genes/ processes) were found for the following pathways: cellcycle (4.68%), MAPK signaling (6.56%), pathways in cancer (11.94%), DNA replication (1.64%). All the children exhibiting the genomic variations altering genes involved inthese pathways were found to present with chromosome instability (mosaic aneuploidy, chromosome breaks/fragi  lity, non speci ï¬c structural chromosomal rearrangements), whereas the remainder was not demonstrating de ï¬nable chromosome instability. Conclusions: Alterations to pathways associated with genome/chromosome stability maintenance through the cell cycle were shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. The consequences of the altera tions were found to be detectable at chromosomal level. These data supports a previously proposed hypothesis describing two /multiple hits to genome stability as apossible mechanism of neuropsychiatric diseases (Iourov et al., 2013).

3036,50, An atlas of human long non coding RNAs,E03.2,,"JapanMapping 5 â ends of RNAs is the key to understand the gene regulation as they identify promoters, as well as long non  coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with functions. In order to com  prehensively understand regulatory elements, we developed the Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) technology, which enables to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) andquantitatively measure their activity throughout the genome at high throughput. In the RIKEN Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome 5 (FANTOM5) project, we createda very broad map of the promoterome and regulatory net  works by simultaneously mapped mRNAs and lncRNAs TSSs and measured their expression at each different pro moters with CAGE, on a comprehensive panel of human and mouse primary cells and other tissues. The study revealed the existence of 223,428 and 162,264 promotersand 65,423 and 44,459 enhancers, in human and mouse respectively, which are often tissue speci ï¬c (Forrest et al. Nature 507, 462, 2014, Andersson et al. Nature 507, 455,2014). Using CAGE, we also built an atlas of human lncRNAs with accurate 5 â ends (Hon et al. Nature 543, 199, 2017). Classi ï¬cation of lncRNAs revealed that most inter  genic lncRNAs are derived from enhancer like regions rather than classic promoters and GWAS trait associated SNPs enriched at lncRNA loci were speci ï¬cally expressed in cell types relevant to the speci ï¬c diseases, suggesting their roles in diseases. Ongoing FANTOM6 project is aiming at creating the broadest database of functionallncRNAs, as a valuable resource in the community. Fur  thermore, we are pursuing a strategic collaboration with the International Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project, which isaiming at the creation of a comprehensive map of all human cell types and states at single cell level, with our newly developed single cell CAGE.

3041,81," Unraveling the cisandtrans genetic regulatory map in over 1,500 induced pluripotent stem cells lines",C03.3,,"Frazer3, O. Stegle1 1EMBL EBI, Hinxton, United Kingdom,2Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,3UCSD, San Diego, CA, United States,4University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States Genome wide association studies have yielded a compen  dium of genetic variants that are associated with humandiseases. However, the majority of these variants are in intergenic region, and understanding their function remains challenging. One strategy for linking these risk variants togenes are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. To date, most large scale eQTL studies have been per  formed in LCLs, blood, or post mortem collected tissues.However, disease causing variants often have tissue  speciï¬c effects. To understand effects manifesting in plur  ipotent and dedifferentiated cells, we mapped eQTLs in thelargest panel of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) considered to date. Using the data collected in the i2QTL CONSORTIUM we mapped eQTLs in a set of ~1,500 iPSC lines, derived from over 1,000 donors. Gene expression was quanti ï¬ed using RNA sequencing, enabling the mapping of eQTLs togenes, exons, transcripts, splicing and UTR usage. We identi ï¬ed signi ï¬cant cis eQTLs for over 63% of expressed genes (FDR < 5%), 5% of which have not been observed inother studies. Our integrative analysis identi ï¬ed hundreds of trans  acting regulatory variants, including ~100 GWAS786 J. del Picchiavariants. One example is the trans  acting SNP near the transcription factor ELF2 which leads to expression changes in genes, downstream of ELF2 . Another interesting example is the observed link between a GWAS variant to atrans  egene ( MED19 ), both previously implicated in prostate carcinoma, but not previously linked. This high lights the relevance of this map for cancer and pluripotency. Currently, we are including both rare  and structural  variants to try and make a de ï¬nitive map of cis andtrans   eQTLs in iPSCs. M.J. Bonder: None. C. Smail: None. D. Jakubosky: None. C.

Jebsen Coeliac Disease Research Centre, Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Blood circulating proteins are often measured as biomarkers or risk factors for various diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, causal relationships betweenproteins and clinical phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we used genetics as an instrumental variable and assessed causality between circulating proteins, gut micro biome, metabolic traits and complex diseases in 1,294 individuals from the LifeLines DEEP cohort, which has genetics, proteomics, gut microbiome data and over 2,000phenotypes available. In this study, we focused on 92 CVD related proteins and ï¬rst tested their association with genetic variation and microbiome. Then we performed a two directional Mende  lian randomization analysis to assess causal relationships between proteins and microbiome, metabolic traits andclinical phenotypes. To do so, we constructed genetic risk scores (GRS) for 73 proteins, 42 microbial factors, over 1000 complex traits and diseases based on our dataset andpublished GWAS studies. We found 327 protein GRS associations signi ï¬cant at FDR < 0.05. The most signi ï¬cant proteins include GRN, SELE, PECAM 1 and ICAM 2,potentially relevant to CVD. Around one third of the associated GRS involve metabolic traits. We also see associations with GRS for lipids and immune cell traits. Wedetected numerous associations between GRS of proteins with microbiome and clinical traits. Our study suggests bi directional causal relationships between circulating proteins, gut microbiome and complex traits and diseases. We prioritize proteins as potential targets for therapeutic treatment if they are causal risk factors, andproteins as biomarkers to monitor disease progression if their alteration is a consequence of a speci ï¬c disease.

Moreover, the reduced number ofoffspring in individuals engaging in non heterosexual behavior (NHB) presents a Darwinian paradox: why are variants that predispose to NHB are maintained in thepopulation despite apparent selection against them? We report the results from the largest study of sexual orientation by focusing on two main phenotypes: NHB, de ï¬ned as having had at least one same sex partner (N ,28,486 cases and 469,427 controls) and number of partners in802 J. del Picchiaheterosexual individuals (NSP;N ,362,993 individuals) in a meta analysis of UK Biobank and 23andMe.

A signi ï¬cant heritability enrichment in brain  expressed genes was observed for NSP, but not for NHB.The strong genetic correlation between NHB and NSP (rg,0.47,P,9.5x10  25), which replicated in an external study of adolescents (P ,0.007), is consistent with antag  onistic pleiotropy, suggesting that variants predisposing to NHB increase mating success (as measured by NSP) in heterosexuals. Overall, our results depict NHB as a com plex, heritable behavioral phenotype, partially sharing a genetic component with risk taking/substance use, partially with hormonal related phenotypes. A.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health threat, which affects >10% adult population inWestern countries and is associated with increased risk of end stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and all cause mortality. In the absence of therapies for CKD pre  vention, understanding the biological regulators of glo  merular ï¬ltration rate (GFR), the key element that de ï¬nes CKD, is of the highest relevance. Materials and methods . Within the CKDGen Consor  tium, 121 studies applied standardized protocols and scriptsto run genome wide association scans (GWAS) of estimated GFR (eGFR) on ~9 million high quality SNPs, imputed on the 1000 Genomes ph3v5 or Haplotype Reference Con sortium datasets. We performed ï¬xed effect meta analysis of GWAS data on >750,000 participants of European, East  Asian, South Asian, Hispanic, and African ancestries.Effect heterogeneity due to ancestry was investigated using trans ethnic genome wide meta regression as implemented in MR MEGA. Results . Genomic in ï¬ation was negligible: lambda , 1.05 and LD score regression intercept ,1.04. Across ethnicities, we identi ï¬ed 308 1 Mb segments containing â¥1 SNP associated with eGFR (p value â¤5E 08): 228 of these loci were novel and 80 validated previously identi ï¬ed signals. Trans ethnic meta regression revealed limitedheterogeneity correlated with ancestry for most genomic regions. Approximate conditional analysis of the European  ancestry dataset identi ï¬ed 269 independent variants, which together doubled the eGFR variance explained compared to previous estimates. Conclusions . This study represents the largest screen of kidney function genetic loci to date. The large number of identi ï¬ed loci will contribute to increase our understanding of kidney function âs biology. C. Pattaro: None.",2018.0,,"C.

3053,136,A Deletions at 63 GWAS catalog loci based on genome wide 1000 Genomes project CNV tagging SNPs,P18.77,,"2University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia Background: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) successfully exploit the variability of most abundant DNA variants, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),but frequently fail to provide information about causal mutations. Copy number variation (CNV) impacts pheno  type variability and disease susceptibility and is one of thesources for the so called âmissing heritability â. Despite notable genomic effects of both CNVs and SNPs, the cor  relation between them is understudied, and the role ofCNVs in SNP based phenotypic effects is not established. Methods: We estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between CNVs and SNPs in protein coding genes using the1000 Genomes project sequencing data (1000G) from phase 3. We de ï¬ned CNV tagging SNPs for variants reported in the GWAS catalog for disease/phenotype associations (July,2017) and for recently published DIAGRAM consortium type 2 diabetes (T2D) 1000G reference panel imputed meta analysis in Europeans (PMID:28566273). Results: We replicated established CNV tagging SNP effects at ten loci, including NEGR1, LCE3A/B, CFHR1 3 for obesity, psoriasis and nephropathy, respectively. Werevealed 31 novel CNVs (length 275bp to ~ 6kb), all but one being deletions. Among novel CNVs ï¬fteen are <1kb,tagging lead breast cancer and T2D/lupus erythematosus SNPs at CHST9 and JAZF1 loci among others. Novel CNVs covered drug target genes, such as HTR3D/C/E, PLEKHA1 ,a n d MGST1 and tagged SNPs associated with major depressive disorder, age related macular degenera  tion, and visceral fat, respectively. Conclusion: This is the most detailed CNV tagging SNPs catalog to date, which will help in dissecting the functional impact of SNP trait associations and could drive thedevelopment of new drugs.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col  laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var  iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand  or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno  types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

To address this challenge, we propose a summary statistics based Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach that uses multiple SNPs jointly as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as simultaneous exposures. Such anapproach should be more robust to violations of MR assumptions than state of the art tools (GSMR, TWAS).When applied to 43 human phenotypes it uncovered 3,233 putative genes causally associated with at least one phe  notype resulting in 8,388 gene trait associations; of note 5,982 of these loci were missed by GWAS. For example, expression of CRIPT , previously associated with a Men  delian syndrome with short stature (OMIM:615789), iscausally associated with height in the general population. Similarly, expression of the RIDDLE syndrome associated RNF168 (OMIM:611943) correlates with educational attainment. Our analysis found 58% (1,866/3,233) of genes having pleiotropic causal effect, impacting up to 20 traits. Notably, ANKRD55 showed directionally consistent causal effect on rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn âs disease and in ï¬am  matory bowel disease. Using eQTLs from multiple tissues (GTEx) revealed numerous tissue speci ï¬c causal effects, often driven by differences in gene expression. In line with previous ï¬ndings, LDL level is driven speci ï¬cally by SORT1 liver expression.Our method identi ï¬es loci missed by conventional GWAS and pinpoints likely functionally relevant disease genes in known regions. Our ï¬ndings unravel tissue speci ï¬c, causal gene expression networks shared among a range of phenotypes.

Whereas LDSC regression uses summary statistics, methods like Haseman Elston (HE)regression and genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) restric  ted maximum likelihood infer parameters such as SNP  based heritability from individual level data directly.Therefore, these two types of methods are typically con  sidered to be profoundly different. Nevertheless, recent work has revealed that LDSC and HE regression yield near identical SNP based heritability estimates when confound  ing strati ï¬cation is absent. We now extend the equivalence;Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 855under the strati ï¬cation assumed by LDSC regression, we show that the intercept can be estimated from individual  level data by transforming the coef ï¬cients of a regression of the phenotype on the leading principal components from the GRM. Using simulations, considering various degrees and forms of population strati ï¬cation, we ï¬nd that intercept estimates obtained from individual level data are nearly equivalent to estimates from LDSC regression ( R2> 99%). An empirical application corroborates these ï¬ndings. Hence, LDSC regression is not profoundly different from methods using individual level data; parameters that are identi ï¬ed by LDSC regression are also identi ï¬ed by meth  ods using individual level data. In addition, our results indicate that, under strong strati ï¬cation, there is mis  attribution of strati ï¬cation to the slope of LDSC regression, inï¬ating estimates of SNP based heritability from LDSC regression ceteris paribus . Hence, the intercept is not a panacea for population strati ï¬cation. Consequently, LDSC  regression estimates should be interpreted with caution, especially when the intercept estimate is signi ï¬cantly greater than one. R. de Vlaming: None. M. Johannesson: None.

Here, we systematically dissected the functional networks associatedwith 16p11.2 RGD from transcriptome analyses of 70 mice with reciprocal CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region across cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, as well as liver, white andbrown adipose tissues in a subset of 16 mice (n ,250 samples). We integrated these data with brain tissues from a Kctd13 mouse model (a putative driver of 16p11.2 neu  roanatomical phenotypes, n ,50), and CRISPR engi  neered, isogenic 16p11.2 iPSC derived NSCs (n ,25) and induced neurons (n ,27). The strongest magnitude of effect sizes from 7qF3 were observed across brain regions by comparison to non brain tissues (cortex 7qF3 region aver  age p value ,8.80E 35; non brain p ,0.0013), re ï¬ecting the ~3x higher basal expression changes. Coexpression network analyses isolated a consistent module of 16p11.2 genes, as well as a module that was highly enriched forconstrained genes (ExAC pLI â¥0.9), autism associated genes, early fetal development coexpression networks derived from BrainSpan, and neurological phenotypes andprocesses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in this âconstrained âmodule network; moreover, DEGs from the Kctd13 mouse coalesced into this samemodule (cortex enrichment p ,7.82E 41), suggesting overlap in altered transcriptional networks between full length CNV and deletion of KCTD13 alone. These analysesidentify a tissue speci ï¬c impact of 16p11.2 RGD that converges on a module of co expressed genes that are intolerant to genetic perturbation and associated with criticalprocesses in human neurodevelopment.

Corton IIS   University Hospital FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az, Madrid, Spain Congenital aniridia is a panocular disease, with a worldwide incidence of 1:50.000 100.000 births, characterized by iris and foveal hypoplasia and additional anomalies in thecornea, anterior segment and lens, leading to low visual acuity. Up to 90% of the aniridia cases carried monoallelic loss of function variants causing haploinsuf ï¬ciency of PAX6 , a highly conserved transcriptional regulator that is critical for normal ocular development. Here, we aimed to assess functionally the implication on splicing of different exonic and intronic variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS), mainly located in the PAX6 homeodomain. First, novel VUS including synonymous, missense and non canonical splicing variants were identi ï¬ed in our cohort of 87 Spanish families with aniridia after classical genotyping and/or targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of theentire PAX6 locus. No additional pathogenic variants were found in other 250 eye developmental genes. Functional splicing assays were performed using in silico predictors, in vitro minigenes and, when available, patients derived lymphocytes cell lines. We described new spliceogenic mechanisms for PAX6 variants through activating different exonic cryptic donors as the most plausible cause for congenital aniridia in several families. These included an additional case of parental PAX6 mosaicism, as con ï¬rmed by digital droplet PCR, for a synonymous variant in an asymptomatic mother with two affected siblings. In conclusion, clinical interpretation of silent and non canonical splicing variants represents a real challenge for the genetic counseling.

With this study,we aim to increase our knowledge of this complex disease. Materials and Methods: We performed a case control GWAS analysis on 2663 subjects (aged > ,50) coming from Italy, Northern Europe and Caucasus clinically char  acterized including the audiometric phenotype. Cases and controls were classi ï¬ed as previously described (DOI:10.3109/21695717.2014.911472). Genotype data were imputed using 1000Gph3 reference panel. Results were pooled together with METAL. Replication of resultswas performed with UK Biobank data (ie. speech in noise phenotype). Analyses on natural selection in European populations were performed and integrated haplotype scores(iHS) on signi ï¬cant GWAS results were collected. Results: Meta analysis identi ï¬ed some strongly sig  niï¬cant loci. To prioritize these genes, signals of selection were checked to evaluate the presence of genetic variants that could have some evolutionary role and a stronger effect. A signi ï¬cant hit on chr5 was detected in a gene/ protein (|iHS|score>2) catalysing the conversion of homo  cysteine to other amino acids. Signal of selection was pre  sent in North European populations, but absent in SouthEuropean ones. Interestingly, literature showed a relation  ship between hyperhomocysteinemia induced by folate deï¬ciency and premature hearing loss, prompting further investigation and discussion on these results.

While most (80%) AS cases are X linked, approximately 15% and 5% areautosomal recessive or dif ï¬cult to differentiate from thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) dominant forms. Digenic inheritance among COL4A3 COL4A5 or their concomitance with other glomerulopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD) related genes, has been recently proposed to explain the variable phenotypic expression andincomplete penetrance frequently observed in AS patients.1244Materials and Methods: NGS analysis of 55 glomer  ulopathy and CKD related genes was performed in a group of 56 unrelated Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In all patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. Overall, 17 known and 32 novel, likely pathogenic alterations in COL4A3  COL4A5 were identi ï¬ed. The inheritance was X linked in 73% of cases, remaining 9% autosomal recessive and 18% were dominant AS/TBMN. Changes were randomly distributed across allCOL4A3  COL4A5 coding regions, however we revealed a recurrent COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A in twelve patients. Additionally, four patients with this alteration had likelypathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 , which may modify disease âs severity. Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the gen  otypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on the genotype phenotype correlations. Multiple gene sequencing is an effective approach to obtain geneticinformation in AS, particularly about the mode of inheri  tance which is important for counselling and may help to predict the clinical course, especially for those patients withmild, non speci ï¬c or atypical phenotype.

3086,132,A Gastrointestinal dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder: New insights from the Foxp1 +/ mouse with altered gut motility and achalasia,P03.05,,"D. Groneberg2, A. Reigl2, E. Zizer3, A. Friebe2, B. Niesler1, G. Rappold1 1Department of Human Molecular Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,2Institute of Physiology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany,3Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but these symptoms are often overlooked and it is still not clear how GI dysfunction relates to the core features of ASD.FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectualdisability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano  metry. Several Foxp1 targets previously identi ï¬ed by microarray analysis in the brain were signi ï¬cantly deregu  lated in the oesophagus of Foxp1 +/  mice. The total gut transit was signi ï¬cantly prolonged. Spatiotemporal maps depicting the colonic contraction patterns revealed strongly disturbed contractility and peristalsis. Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism spectrum disorder may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1  dependent deregulation of genes. Furthermore, this is theï¬rst report of achalasia being caused by a heterozygous gene deletion. H. FrÃ¶hlich: None. M. Kollmeyer: None. M. Stuhlin  ger: None. V. Linz: None. D. Groneberg: None. A.

Rappold1 1Department of Human Molecular Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,2Institute of Physiology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany,3Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but these symptoms are often overlooked and it is still not clear how GI dysfunction relates to the core features of ASD.FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectualdisability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano  metry. Several Foxp1 targets previously identi ï¬ed by microarray analysis in the brain were signi ï¬cantly deregu  lated in the oesophagus of Foxp1 +/  mice. The total gut transit was signi ï¬cantly prolonged. Spatiotemporal maps depicting the colonic contraction patterns revealed strongly disturbed contractility and peristalsis. Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism spectrum disorder may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1  dependent deregulation of genes. Furthermore, this is theï¬rst report of achalasia being caused by a heterozygous gene deletion. H. FrÃ¶hlich: None. M. Kollmeyer: None. M. Stuhlin  ger: None. V. Linz: None. D. Groneberg: None. A.

In humans, point mutations in the p63 coding region lead to develop mental defects, including syndromic orofacial clefting. Notably, common risk variants located intronically in p63 contribute also to the risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P), the most frequent isolated form of orofacial clefting. To date, our knowledge is limited about the role of p63 in human craniofacial development,due in part to a lack of tractable models. Here we investigated the role of p63 in human craniofacial development, and in the pathogenesis of nsCL/P. Usingan inducible trans differentiation model and systematic epigenomic sequencing (including ATAC seq together with1272ChIP seq of p63 and H3K27ac) we show that p63 establishes enhancers at craniofacial development genes to modulate their transcription. Speci ï¬c substitution mutations in the DNA binding or SAM protein interaction domain of p63 respectively eliminate or reduce establishment of these enhancers. Furthermore, using large scale GWAS data weshow that enhancers established by p63 are highly enriched for SNPs associated with nsCL/P. These orthogonal approaches indicate a strong molecular link between p63enhancer function and nsCL/P, illuminating molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental defect and revealing vital regulatory elements and new candidatecausative genes.

The majority of genetic risk loci map to non coding regions of the genome, suggesting thatthe underlying pathomechanisms act through regulatory effects on gene expression. One potential mechanism might be posttranscriptional gene regulation by micro RNAs(miRNA). For nsCL/P, a suitable cellular model are human neural crest cells (hNCCs), the mesenchymal precursor cells that give rise to the majority of cranial cartilage and bones. Methods and Results: We combined array based miRNA pro ï¬ling in hNCC with in house GWAS data to identify candidate miRNAs for nsCL/P. This analysisrevealed miR 149 3p as strong candidate for nsCL/P involvement, based on consistent hNCC expression across replicates and the presence of associated risk variants withinits genomic region. Next, we aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of miR 149 3p in the context of craniofacial development. In vitro , we modi ï¬ed miRNA149 abundance levels in cultured hNCC by overexpression and inhibition assays and monitored the migration behavior of hNCC using scratch assays. We found that inhibition ofmiR 149 3p signi ï¬cantly increases cellular migration of hNCC compared to untreated hNCCs. RNA Seq data at different time points revealed differential expression ofGPC1 and BMP7. To follow up these ï¬ndings, in vivo analyses are currently performed in the zebra ï¬sh. Conclusion: Through integration of large scale genetic data and expression patterns in relevant cell types we here identi ï¬ed a novel regulatory mechanism that is involved in craniofacial development and might be related to the etiol ogy of nsCL/P.

Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Approximately 10% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) remainwithout a molecular diagnosis (AS like). Whole exome sequencing in a cohort of 17 AS like patients led to the identi ï¬cation of 11 pathogenic/likely pathogenic de novo variants in 10 genes involved in neurodevelopment disorders, not previously associated with AS. Clinical re  evaluation was performed in order to establish thegenotype phenotype correlation in the molecularly diag  nosed patients. Materials and Methods: The clinical characteristics of the 11 patients were reviewed for the presence of the con  sistent and frequent AS clinical features. Additional dis  tinctive clinical features were collected and compared withthe clinical phenotypes reported in the literature in patients carrying pathogenic variants in the identi ï¬ed genes. Results: Clinical re evaluation showed that the 11 patients meet the consistent and almost all of the frequent features of AS. The additional clinical ï¬ndings in patients carrying variants in SMARCE1, KIF1A, SYNGAP1 and SLC6A1 genes ï¬t with the phenotypes reported in patients with pathogenic variants in the same genes. On the otherhand, patients carrying variants in SATB2, ASXL3, SPTAN1 and LAS1L genes present some but not all the consistent features attributed to these genes. Conclusion: Molecular heterogeneity in AS like patients, together with the presence of distinctive clinical features in some of them, indicates that AS like is made up by differentclinical entities overlapping phenotypically with AS, mak  ing them dif ï¬cult to distinguish.

The majority of reported patients harbored de novo loss of function (LoF) variants. To date, the phenotype of only four patients has been precisely described in the literature, contrasting with the relative frequency of detection of such LoF GATAD2B variants. Here, we describe 10 patients with con ï¬rmed LoF GATAD2B variants and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Methods: Patients were included by contacting referent clinicians from several French genetics departments. Results: Developmental delay was severe with a median age of 2.4 years (range [2 5]) for independent walking and of 2.75 years (range [1 4]) for ï¬rst spoken words. They showed very little subsequent progress, one patientremaining non verbal at age 30 years. ID was mostly moderate, with only one severe and one mild case, which differs from the original description of severe ID. Mostcommon dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, downturned mouth and, anomalies of the extremities. Conversely, prenatal compli cations, non cerebral organ malformations, epilepsy and autistic behaviour were very rare. One patient presented asthma and recurrent respiratory infections, another onepresented severe feeding dif ï¬culties and developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and IgG de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: NGS based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of GATAD2B variations. Better knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for a cor  rect interpretation of the molecular results and for anaccurate management of these patients. G. Vera: None. A. Sorlin: None. G.

The ï¬rst patient showed severe developmental delay, thin corpus callosum (CC), prominent supraorbital ridges withsynophrys, deep set eyes and ï¬eshy earlobes: in order to validate our clinical suspicion of Borjeson Forssman Lehmann syndrome (BFLS), we performed PHF6 muta  tional analysis that revealed a de novo missense mutation within the PHD type 2 domain; X inactivation analysis showed skewed X inactivation in blood lymphocytes. The second patient had severe delayed language development, intellectual disability (ID), hypermetropia, strabismus,linear skin hyperpigmentation and increasing obesity: PWS AS test and array CGH resulted normal. Whole  exome sequencing (WES), surprisingly, disclosed a de novo missense mutation in PHF6 , in the same functional domain as our ï¬rst patient; in this case, X inactivation analysis showed normal X inactivation in blood lymphocytes. BFLSis an X linked recessive disease, characterized by ID, epilepsy, hypogonadism, hypometabolism, obesity and a typical facial gestalt; female carriers usually not show anyï¬ndings or present only mild symptoms. To date, de novo aberrations in PHF6 were reported in 13 females with a variable phenotype, characterized by ID, characteristicfacial features, ï¬ngers and dental anomalies, only partially overlapping with BFSL as described in males. Molecular genetics has opened a new path to understand thecomplexity of ID, mostly in female patients, where we would tend to exclude a priori a known as X linked recessive condition. However, in cases with heterogeneousID phenotypes, WES is the instrument to address the exact diagnosis, as suggested in our second case. A. Pagliazzi: None. R. Artuso: None. G. Tra ï¬cante: None.

It has one of the highest mortality rates of all psychiatric disorders and psychological and pharmacologi cal treatments show only limited effect. Materials and Methods: As an international collabora  tion between the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative andthe Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we performed the worldwide largest genome wide association study (GWAS) amassing 16,992 AN cases and 55,525 controls. Secondaryanalyses included chromosome conformation capture (i.e., Hi C), linkage disequilibrium score regression, generalised summary data based Mendelian randomisation (GSMR),gene, and gene set analysis using MAGMA. Results: The GWAS identi ï¬ed 8 independent loci and estimated its common genetic variant heritability to be 11 17%, indicating a polygenic trait. Enrichment analyses implicate central nervous tissues and cell types in AN. Additionally, AN showed positive genetic correlations withobsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, r g,.45), major depressive disorder (r g,.28), and anxiety (r g,.25), mirroring its clinical comorbidity pro ï¬le. Surprisingly, bidirectional GSMR a showed signi ï¬cant bidirectional relationship between AN and BMI ( Î²;;;;; ANâBMI, 0.20; OR BMIâAN,0.96), indicating that genomic variants that predispose to lower body mass may also increase liability for AN. Complementing these ï¬ndings, we also reported genomic overlap between AN and metabolic traits, such asfasting insulin concentrations (r g, .24) as well as high  density lipoprotein concentrations (r g,.21). Conclusions: Through these ï¬ndings, we are encoura  ging a reconceptualization of AN as both a psychiatric and metabolic disorder.

Large genome rearrangements are being identi ï¬ed in ASD as an under  lying cause for development of this syndrome. These rearrangements are mostly deletions, but duplications canbe found. We present case of twin boys with APBA2 gene duplication. Materials and Methods: Twin boys, age 9 were referred to genetic counseling and testing with diagnosed ASD (DSM IV). DNA was isolated from buccal swabs of the boys, and 3 ml of whole blood from parents.

It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD.

The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high  resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non  polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k).

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together.

Anderlid4, A. Falk3, K. Tammimies1 1Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (KIND), Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden,2Department of Women âs and Children âs Health, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden, 3Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden,4Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Solna, Sweden Introduction: Mutations in the CASK gene cause a range of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders such as micro cephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), epilepsy, developmental delay and autism. CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations. Our results can guidedrug development and aid in understanding the pathological spectrum of CASK mutations. M. Becker: None. F. Mastropasqua: None. J.P. Reis  ing: None. I. Rabkina: None. L.

Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p.Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen  cing of an autism spectrum disorder trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C  terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis  localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p.Gly664*, shows a very similar effect on the location of the NCL protein, thus con ï¬rming the presence of the nucleolar location signal of NCL protein in this region. FRAP showssigniï¬cant changes in the kinetics and mobility of mutant NCL protein in the nucleoplasm. Conclusions: Several other studies have also reported de novo mutations in NCL in ASD or neurodevelopmental dis  orders.

Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Madrid, SpainIntroduction: The Spanish Undiagnosed Rare Diseases Program (SpainUDP) performs extended genetic analyses and deep phenotyping to get a de ï¬nite diagnosis in rare syndrome cases. We present the case of a 3 year old male with severe generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness together with neurodevelopmental delay. He presentsmicrocephaly and dysmorphic features highlighting micro  retrognathy, low set ears and hypertelorism. Materials and Methods: Trio based exome analysis was carried out by using Nextera Truseq Rapid Enrichment kit and sequenced in NextSeq500 (Illumina). Results: The exome analysis revealed a novel mutation consisting on a small de novo 30 bp deletion in exon 9 of AUTS2 gene (Autism susceptibility candidate 2, OMIM:607270), which allowed the diagnosis of this patientas AUTS2 Syndrome or Mental Retardation, autosomal dominant 26 (OMIM:615834). AUTS2 gene is involved in the development of neurological disorders. Alterations ofAUTS2 gene were described as a result of genomic rear  rangements, although large copy number variations and intragenic deletions or mutations have also been describedto cause this syndrome. It is noteworthy that the deletion found in this patient included the transcription start site of the short isoform of the gene, which plays an important rolein brain development. The gene expression analysis showed that the deletion causes reduction in the level of expression not only of the short isoform but also of the completetranscript of the gene. Conclusions: This case helps in establishing the genotype phenotype correlation adding more evidence tothe role of mutations speci ï¬cally affecting the short isoform for the development of a severe phenotype.

3175,494,C Genome wide association study for late onset Alzheimer's disease in Japanese population,P09.068,,"Japan By 2025, the number of people living with dementia in Japan is expected to increase to 7 million. Most common form of dementia is late onset Alzheimer âs disease (LOAD). The pathogenesis of LOAD is result from interactions among multiple environmental and genetic factors which consist of considerable hereditary compo nents. Recent large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) in Caucasian have revealed more than 30 genetic loci for LOAD susceptibility. In contrast, GWAS for Asiangroups including Japanese are relatively modest, and have poor reproducibility of associations for identi ï¬ed loci in Caucasian due to possible difference of genetic architectureamong ethnicity in addition to lack of study power. In this context, we launched GWAS using an ethnicity speci ï¬c SNP array, Japonica. To date, we obtained the genotypedata for approximately 7,000 Japanese individuals (includ  ing 2,400 LOAD, 1,400 other dementia and 3,200 controls) and imputed the data with a Japanese reference panel(ToMMo 3.5KJ) constructed using whole genome sequences from 3,500 Japanese. We tentatively conducted a GWAS using the imputed genotype data (~10,000,000SNPs) for approximately 2,400 LOAD cases and 3,200 controls. We combined this GWAS result and the data of another Japanese GWAS reported elsewhere for meta analysis (a total of 8,000 individuals), and found GWAS signiï¬cance for the APOE and SORL1 loci and a novel locus with LOAD. We further identi ï¬ed several new candidate susceptible loci for LOAD with suggestive signiï¬cance. We also found convincing associations for several known AD loci, such as CLU ,PICALM andABCA7 discovered in Caucasian population. K. Ozaki: None. R. Mitsumori: None. S. Niida: None. D.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT  qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail  able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers.Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange  ment.

Mutations inSPAST , encoding Spastin, are the most frequent cause of HSP. Recently, through the analysis of 842 SPAST mutated patients, we showed that mutation nature accounts for some of the age at onset variability and that sex in ï¬uences the disorder penetrance. To identify additional age at onset modiï¬ers, a GWAS analysis was performed on 134 SPAST truncating mutations carriers. Materials and Methods: Patients were genotyped using Illumina In ï¬niumOmni2.5Exome 8 kit. Single variant test was performed using a logistic mixed model for binary traits available with GMMAT R package, adjusted for sex and patients ârelatedness. Patients with very discordant age at onset were compared ( â¤15 years versus â¥45 years). Results: A group of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (r 2>0.8) reached a p value suggestive for association (top p  value,10e 6). The 7 suggestive SNPs are located on chromosome 19, in the 3 âUTR region of SARS2 gene and are described as eQTLs of this gene in the GTEx database.Among the genotyped patients, a signi ï¬cantly lower age at onset (p<0.0001, Mann Whitney test) was associated with the minor allele at all SNPs, as well as a tendency to adecreased disorder severity. Conclusions: Pathogenic mutations affecting SARS2 , encoding a mitochondrial seryl tRNA synthetase, havealready been linked to progressive spastic paraparesis onset, suggesting it as a good candidate. iPSCs derived neurons andDrosophila model are being used to further con ï¬rm its role as SPAST  HSP age of onset modi ï¬er.

Pirogov, Moscow, RussianFederation, 3Research Institute for Pulmonology, Moscow, Russian Federation,4National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russian Federation Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by pathogenic activity of the chimerictyrosine kinase BCR/ABL which stimulates uncontrolled cell proliferation. Primary resistance to the targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is registered in up to 20%of patients. The aim of the work is to search for possible markers of the ef ï¬cacy of TKI therapy. We sequenced 60 exomes of patients with CML with different response totreatment on the platform NextSeq â¢550, Illumina. The microRNA expression pro ï¬le (n,6 with the optimal response, n ,6 with failure of therapy) was examined using Nanostring technology and nCountermiRNA Expression Assay. On an average, we found 280000 variants, which arecurrently under analysis. GWAS analysis using Hail did not reveal polymorphisms associated with the response to therapy. Based on the results of the expression analysis of 17 microRNAs with differential expression in two groups were selected (p <0.05). The greatest difference in expression is shown for hsa miR 4286. Analysis of thefunctional role of microRNA revealed 40 pathways enriched with genes regulated by 17 microRNAs. The most important pathway is Pathways in cancer (hsa05200, p , 9.5 * 10  14). The pathways Chronic myeloid leukemia (hsa05220, p ,0.00018), and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (hsa05221; p ,0.04) are also enriched. Deeper data analysis will help to ï¬nd the possible predictors of the response to therapy, as well as allow us to study the mechanisms of disease progression, and microRNAs maybe prognostic markers of a response to targeted CML therapy.

3209,711,B Exploring the role of CCAT1 andCCAT2 long non coding RNA in colorectal carcinoma metastasis,P12.049,,"P. Cheah1,2,3 1Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore, 2National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore, 3Duke NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore Introduction: Dysregulation of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been recently implicated in cancers. Up regulation of two lncRNAs, CCAT1 andCCAT2 has been separately associated with more aggressive colorectal cancer (CRC) and worse prognosis. The ï¬rst GWAS  identi ï¬ed SNP linked to CRC risk, rs6983267, maps to CCAT2 , and is reported to elevate the expression of c Myc , situated about 300 kb away. Nevertheless, these twolncRNAs have never been studied together with their oncotarget c Myc. Material and Methods: In this study, we measured the expression of CCAT1 ,CCAT2 andc Myc in 150 matched mucosa tumor samples of early stage microsatellite stable Chinese CRC patients with de ï¬nitive metastasis status by real time RT PCR. The expression pro ï¬le is then correlated to the SNP genotype and the clinical data. Results: Expression of c Myc in the tumor is signi ï¬cantly up regulated in metastasis positive CRC patients (T test, p,0.0229) and signi ï¬cantly correlated to time to metastasis by Cox regression analysis [Hazard Ratio ,1.47 (1.10, 1.97), p ,0.0107]. Upregulation of c Myc expression is also signiï¬cantly associated with the risk genotype (GG) of rs6983267. The expression of c Myc is signi ï¬cantly (p<0.0001) correlated to that of CCAT1 and CCAT2 (R 2,0.23 and R2,0.18 respectively) in the tumors. How  ever, the expression of CCAT1 and CCAT2 is not sig  niï¬cantly correlated to metastasis status, time to metastasis or the SNP genotypes. Conclusions: Expression of c Myc in the tumors is pre  dictive of metastasis. The expression of CCAT1 andCCAT2 does not add to the predictive value suggesting that theircontribution to metastasis are probably accounted for via their effects on c Myc . L. Thean: None. H.

3222,828,D Finland âs largest next generation biobank provides valuable resources for genomics research,P14.005,,"Helsinki, Finland,2Research Program for Clinical and Molecular Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Background: Studying the genetics of complex diseases requires large genotyped datasets of tens of thousands ofindividuals, while whole exome (WES) or whole genome (WGS) sequencing data is often necessary for studying rare variants. High quality analyses require high quality pheno type data and well de ï¬ned disease endpoints. Since 1992 the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has systematically collected DNA samples from allparticipants of its health examination surveys. These samples have now been processed, and vast amounts of genomic data is available to researchers through THLBiobank. Materials and Methods: THL Biobank collections include genetic data from >10 Finnish study cohorts. Cur rently the collections include: GWAS chip data N>74,000, of which >50,000 imputed in the FinnGen project to a high  coverage population speci ï¬c reference panel (N>100,000 reached within a year); WES N>12,500; WGS N>2,000; methylation data N>500; gene expression data N>550. All study participants can be followed up (for up to 25 years)from national registers for disease endpoints and drugpurchases, and the vast majority has wide availability of questionnaire and laboratory variables. Additionally, there are cells available for >10,000, RNA for >3,000 and NMR metabolomics for >40,000 of these. Results and Conclusions: THL Biobank data is available for research use for researchers and companies worldwide.Since 2015, 98 biobank projects have been initiated, including interesting projects ranging from pharmacoge  nomics and returning genetic data to study participants tocardiovascular and cancer research. Of the biobank pro  jects 93% (91/98) have included genomic data, thus genetic data is of high interest for researchers seeking biobankmaterial. A. Joensuu: None. K. Silander: None. M. Perola: None.

3238,992,A Open Targets Genetics: An open science resource forimproved drug target identi ï¬cation and prioritisation using genetic data,P16.25,,"1Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom,2Open Targets, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom The discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals is a time consuming and expensive process. A major challenge is high attrition, as a large proportion of drugs are found tobe ineffective at clinical trial. However, drugs that have genome wide association study (GWAS) evidence support  ing a link between its target and indication are twice aslikely to be approved for clinical use. Here we present Open Targets Genetics, an open science resource which makes robust connections between disease associated loci andlikely causal genes, to enable the identi ï¬cation and prioritisation of new drug targets. We combine GWAS associations curated from literature and the recently released NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog summary statistics database (including over 3,000 UK Biobank phenotypes) to locate over 100,000 disease associated loci. We then use statistical ï¬ne mapping (or linkage disequilibrium expansion if no summary statistics are available) to identify a set of potentially causal variantsat each locus. Lastly, variants are integrated with functional genomics data (e.g. promoter capture Hi C, DNase hyper  sensitivity sites), molecular quantitative trait loci (e.g.eQTLs, pQTLs) and in silico functional predictions to link each variant to its target gene(s) using a uni ï¬ed evidence score. Most recently, we have added systematic disease molecular trait colocalisation analysis using the upcoming Open Targets European Bioinformatics Institute eQTL database. The results of Open Targets Genetics are made available through our web portal (genetics.opentargets.org), for bulkdownload and via a GraphQL API, enabling users to easily prioritise genes at disease associated loci and assess their potential as pharmaceutical targets.

Epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) havemainly investigated DNA methylation and its association with disease or traits, exposure factors or gene expression. This systematic review aimed to identify all EWASassessing differentially methylated sites associated with asthma in humans.1724Design: Structured systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines, Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was used for bias assessment. Data Sources: We searched PubMed and Embase data  bases from 2005 through 2019. Eligibility Criteria: EWAS studies testing association between differential methylation and asthma in humans. Results: Overall, we identi ï¬ed sixteen EWAS studies complying with our search criteria. Twelve studies wereconducted on children and ten were conducted on sample sizes less than 150 subjects. Four hundred and nineteen CpGs were reported in children studies after correction formultiple testing. In adult studies, thousands of differentially methylated sites were identi ï¬ed. Differential methylation in inï¬ammatory related genes correlated with higher levels of gene expressions of in ï¬ammatory modulators in asthma. Differentially methylated genes associated with asthma included SMAD3, SERPINC1, PROK1, IL13, RUNX3 and TIGIT . Fourty one CpGs were replicated at least once in blood samples, and 28 CpGs were replicated in nasal samples. Conclusion: Although many differentially methylated CpGs in genes known to be involved in asthma have been identi ï¬ed in EWAS to date, we conclude that further studies of larger sample sizes and analyses of differential methy  lation between different phenotypes are needed.

A recent GWAS meta analysis identi ï¬ed 14 risk loci, which are all located in non coding genomic regions. Therefore, our understanding of the biological mechanismsunderlying these associations is incomplete. The aim of this study was (i) to statistically ï¬nemap and (ii) to functionally annotate all known risk loci for BE/EA. First, we calculated credible SNP sets for every risk locus. This resulted in sets of variants that most likely included true causal variants. The credible SNPs were cross referenced with Roadmap chromatin states associated with enhancer activity from esophageal tissue. We functionally annotated variants located in enhancers and investigatednearby genes regarding their function. Based on thisAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1725information, the risk loci were prioritized for subsequent functional follow up analyses. As a ï¬rst result, two credible SNPs at the 5p15 locus are located in an enhancer upstream SLC9A3 , which encodes an epithelial brush border Na H exchanger. Both SNPs, as well as the best associated SNP at 5p15, are eQTLs forSLC9A3 . Interestingly, upregulation of SLC9A3 has been associated to gastroesophageal re ï¬ux disease   a major risk factor for BE/EA. In order to unveil regulatory mechanisms that are involved in the development of BE/EA, we are now per  forming functional analyses. This includes 4C sequencingand dual luciferase assays in cells of all stages of BE/EA development. Altogether, our systematic approach of functional characterization of genetic risk factors will con tribute to the elucidation of pathomechanisms involved in the development of BE/EA. J.

Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are characterized by unique molecular features. Recent studies have revealed that cancer related changes in DNA methylation are not random, and subsets of genes are selectively affected. The aim of theresearch was to characterize methylome pro ï¬les of AC and SCC tumors, and to develop novel prognostic biomarkers speciï¬c for both sub types. Materials and Methods: For large scale methylome proï¬ling, reduced representation bisul ï¬te sequencing (RRBS) in 123 patients with NSCLC was carried out. Thepaired analyses of lung tumor and adjacent normal tissue of patients grouped into several comparison sets was per  formed. Then, using binary segmentation algorithm, dif ferentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identi ï¬ed. Results: Hundreds of DMRs were identi ï¬ed in NSCLC; vast majority of them exhibited hypomethylation in patientswith relapse or who died. In tumors of SCC patients with relapse, several DMRs were detected within GATA2 gene, playing a role in an aggressiveness of lung cancer andespecially important in patients with KRAS mutations. Interestingly, a distinctive methylation levels were observed forRUVBL1  related DMRs in SCC and AC patients with relapse. Hypomethylation of PRKCA , which exhibits sup  pressor activity in lung cancers, was identi ï¬ed in AC patients who eventually did not survive. Conclusion: Obtained results allow for better under  standing of speci ï¬c epigenetic pathways dysregulated in different sub types of NSCLC. We have provided a catalogof methylation related biomarkers predictive in terms of tumor relapse and survival. The study was funded within the MOBIT project (STRATEGMED2/266484/2/NCBR/2015). K.

3267,1102,C The length of the expressed 3' UTR is an intermediatemolecular phenotype linking genetic variants to complex diseases,P18.27,,"P. Provero1,2 1University of Turin, Turin, Italy,2San Raffaele Scienti ï¬c Institute IRCCS, Milan, Italy Introduction: The investigation of the genetic determinants of intermediate molecular phenotypes can provide useful insights about the mechanisms of action of genetic variantsthat have been identi ï¬ed by genome wide association studies (GWAS). We propose a computational strategy to discover genetic variants affecting the relative expression ofalternative 3' untranslated region (UTR) isoforms, generated through alternative polyadenylation (APA), a post  transcriptional regulatory mechanism known to haverelevant functional consequences. Material and Methods: We analyzed whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) data that wereobtained for 373 European individuals (GEUVADIS data  set). RNA Seq data were used, together with an annotation of alternative 3 âUTR isoforms, to compute the expression ratio between the short and long isoform (m/M value) of each gene in each individual. Then, the association betweenthe m/M values of a gene and the genotype of the indivi  duals for each in cis genetic variant was evaluated by linear regression. Results: We identi ï¬ed 2,530 genes with alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs) and we subsequently performed a deep investigation of the possiblemechanisms of action of these variants. In addition, we observed that apaQTLs are signi ï¬cantly enriched in GWAS hits, in particular those associated to immune related andneurological disorders. Conclusions: Our results suggest that genetic variants have a widespread effect on the relative expression ofalternative 3 âUTR isoforms in human. In addition, they point to an important role for genetically determined APA in affecting predisposition to complex diseases and suggestnew ways to extract functional information from GWAS data. E.

However, most of these variants lay in intronic or intragenic regions and do not provide a clear target gene. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)studies and transcription wide association analyses (TWAS) may contribute to explain the observed associations between genetic regions and complex diseases such asCrohn âs disease and ulcerative colitis. In this study, we conducted a summary based TWAS for In ï¬ammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) risk using RNA seq data form alargest set of colon tissue biopsies from healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: Colon tissue biopsies were obtained from 191 healthy volunteers at colonoscopy.Genetic predictive models for the expression of ~6,000 genes were obtained through penalized elastic net models using PredXcan software. Subsequently, summary TWASwas performed combining genetic prediction models andgenome wide association results for IBD risk published by the International IBD Genetics Consortium. Results: TWAS analysis identi ï¬ed one novel IBD locus association (INPP5E gene at 9q34.3 region; P ,1.2x10 19) and eleven new candidate genes in known GWAS loci (P<1x10 8). We envisage enlarging the analyzed data set tonearly 500 samples during the following months. Conclusions: Our ï¬ndings help to explain observed association results for diseases affecting colon tissue andprovide target genes for further functional analyses.

However, most of these variants lay in intronic or intragenic regions and do not provide a clear target gene. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)studies and transcription wide association analyses (TWAS) may contribute to explain the observed associations between genetic regions and complex diseases such asCrohn âs disease and ulcerative colitis. In this study, we conducted a summary based TWAS for In ï¬ammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) risk using RNA seq data form alargest set of colon tissue biopsies from healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: Colon tissue biopsies were obtained from 191 healthy volunteers at colonoscopy.Genetic predictive models for the expression of ~6,000 genes were obtained through penalized elastic net models using PredXcan software. Subsequently, summary TWASwas performed combining genetic prediction models andgenome wide association results for IBD risk published by the International IBD Genetics Consortium. Results: TWAS analysis identi ï¬ed one novel IBD locus association (INPP5E gene at 9q34.3 region; P ,1.2x10 19) and eleven new candidate genes in known GWAS loci (P<1x10 8). We envisage enlarging the analyzed data set tonearly 500 samples during the following months. Conclusions: Our ï¬ndings help to explain observed association results for diseases affecting colon tissue andprovide target genes for further functional analyses.

Long non coding RNA (lncRNA) have previously been demonstrated to be enriched within genomewide association study (GWAS) loci, however the sig  niï¬cance of this enrichment, its relevance, and its generalisability to individual traits is unknown. Materials and Methods: Using fgwas, the ability of individual annotations to improve a probabilistic model of disease susceptibility was tested. Publicly available lncRNAannotations, including lncRBase, lncipedia and the miTranscriptome assembly, were incorporated, in addition to cell type speci ï¬c chromatin states annotations. Results: Using fgwas it is possible to reproduce a pre  viously reported enrichment of enhancers active in primary T helper cells amongst RA GWAS loci (log 2enrichment 2.96, 95% con ï¬dence interval [2.01, 3.69]), however esti  mates for enrichment of lncRNA are statistically insignif  icant. Interestingly, the miTranscriptome assembly,previously used to demonstrate an enrichment of lncRNA amongst GWAS loci, is demonstrated to be depleted amongst RA loci, using fgwas (log 2enrichment  0.80, 95% conï¬dence interval [ 1.70,  0.08]). The enrichment estimate associated with alternative databases of lncRNA seems to vary based on the protein coding potential threshold appliedto discriminate against protein coding transcripts and appears to be independent of chromatin state annotations.

3291,24, Alu elements and cellular RNA metabolism,S08.2,,"ID (B/ID) SINEs can promote mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, translation in the cytoplasm, and/or Staufen mediated mRNA decay (SMD) when present in mRNA 3 â²UTRs. The transposable nature of SINEs, their presence in long noncoding RNAs, their interactions withStaufen (STAU), and their rapid divergence in different evolutionary lineages suggest they could have generated substantial modi ï¬cation of post transcriptional gene control networks during mammalian evolution. Some of the variation in SMD regulation produced by SINE insertion might have been similarly adaptive in separate mammalianlineages, leading to parallel evolution of the STAU network by independent exaptation of SINEs. To explore this, we searched for orthologous gene pairs, each carrying aspecies speci ï¬c3 â²UTR SINE and each regulated by SMD, by measuring changes in mRNA abundance after individual depletion of two SMD factors, STAU1 and UPF1, in bothhuman and mouse myoblasts. We identi ï¬ed and con ï¬ rmed orthologous gene pairs with 3 â²UTR SINEs that have been independently exapted in mouse and humans for SMDcontrol of myoblast metabolism.

Maquat: None.Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1055S08.3 Insertion variants at disease risk loci K. H. BurnsJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States Interspersed repeat sequences derived from mobile genetic elements make up much of our DNA. In this presentation, I will introduce the concept that transposable element insertions deliver repressed functions to genomic locations trans  activating functions bound by repressive silencers, and splicing functions masked by RNA binding proteins. These antithetical properties are the result of complexrelationships pitting the intrinsic activities of these retro  elements against the host factors that evolve to mitigate their effects. Insertions provide a unique substrate forevolutionary innovation since either of the opposing functions can be made permanent. Our lab studies how the contours of this con ï¬ict impact human disease. First, I will describe how speci ï¬c transposable element loci âescape âsilencing in diseased tissues. For example, long interspersed element 1 (LINE 1) sequences are commonlyderepressed in human cancers, resulting in somatic retro  transposition events and potentially creating unique mole  cular requirements for cancer cell growth. Second, I willdescribe how rare and commonly occurring inherited insertion alleles can affect mRNA expression and splicing and lead to genetic disease. Examples include highlypenetrant disease alleles, as well as variants with lesser effects that are detectable by genome wide association study (GWAS). We have cataloged 809 polymorphic Alu elements mapping to 1,159 loci implicated in disease risk by genome wide association study (GWAS) (P < 10 â8). We found that Aluinsertion variants occur disproportio  nately at GWAS loci (P ,0.013). Moreover, we have identi ï¬ed many of these Aluelements in linkage disequili  brium (LD) with the trait associated SNP. We are nowworking to understand their molecular mechanisms. One variant of interest is an Aluinsertion at the CD58 locus on a haplotype that affects multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility(OR,1.3 p,3x10 â10). We found perfect LD between the trait associated SNP (rs2300747) and the intronic Alu insertion. We went on to show that the Alualters splicing of the CD58 mRNA, promoting exon 3 skipping in splice reporter assays, and creating a splice quantitative trait locus (sQTL) in lymphoblastoid cell lines. The aberrant CD58 isoform is frame shifted, and presumed to be non  functional. This work provides a broader perspective on how structural variants of repetitive DNAs may contributeto human disease.

3293,28, From association to causal variant(s): statistical methods for ï¬nemapping,S10.1,,"Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have narrowed down the genome into regions underlying complex phenotypes. However, any one region still harbours thousands of correlated genetic variants, complicatingbiological follow up. We therefore need variable selection to reï¬ne the large set of variants simply associated with a phenotype down to a much smaller set of putative causalvariants with direct effect on the phenotype. We present the FINEMAP software that couples Bayesian variable selection for ï¬ne mapping causal variants with an ultrafast high resolution stochastic search. We show that FINEMAP is as accurate as gold standard exhaustive search implemented in existing ï¬ne mapping approaches when the latter can be completed and achieves even higher accuracy when the latter must be constrained due to computational reasons. We further demonstrate that FINEMAP opens up completely new opportunities by ï¬ne mapping genomic regions with tens of thousands of variants in few minutes while exhaustive search would require thousands of years. Statistical ï¬ne mapping methods that use GWAS results also require Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) information. We report important practical consequences of misspeci ï¬cation of LD that could happen when publicly available reference genomes are used. We demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that the size of the reference panel needs toscale with the GWAS sample size to produce accurate results. This ï¬nding has major implications for the appli  cation of all ï¬ne mapping methods using GWAS results from GWAS consortia in which accurate LD information from each participating study is typically not available. GWAS sample sizes soon counted in millions provide unprecedented opportunities to use ï¬ne mapping results for downstream analysis. Therefore, we investigate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by a ï¬ne  mapping model compared to the variance component model BOLT. Although results from FINEMAP and BOLT showAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1057good concordance in regions with negligible contribution to the genome wide heritability, BOLT yields larger estimates than FINEMAP in regions with moderate to high herit  ability levels. Scaling the analysis to biobank data, we further illustrate how violations of model assumptions on polygenicity induces inaccuracy to heritability estimatesthat become more accentuated as statistical power to iden  tify causal variants increases.

Recently, we performed agenome wide association study (GWAS) meta analysis of 694,649 individuals from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium and UKBiobank (UKBB) and identi ï¬ed 346 genome wide sig  niï¬cant (p < 5 Ã 10 â9) loci associated to WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Additionally, we recapitulated theknown sexual dimorphism observed in WHRadjBM: ~30% of all loci are sex dimorphic, with most signals showing a larger effect in women. Notably, this sexual dimorphism isvirtually absent in GWAS of BMI, prompting a host of questions around the underlying biology of fat distribution and how elucidating (potentially sex speci ï¬c) mechanisms could yield insights into the etiology of fat distribution. We thus set out to perform comprehensive ï¬ne mapping and enrichment testing in the 346 loci associated withWHRadjBMI, as well as the 266 and 91 loci discovered in the women only and men only meta analyses, respectively. We used up to 484,563 samples from the UK Biobank to:(i) examine enrichment of WHRadjBMI associated loci in hundreds of cell and tissue types, (ii) perform Bayesian ï¬ne  mapping to generate so called âcredible sets âof likely  causal SNPs, (iii) test for global and local patterns of enrichment of the credible sets in various genomic anno  tations, and (iv) perform functional work on likely causalvariants and genes. Global pathway analyses across the full GWAS results replicated the previously described enrichment ofWHRadjBMI signals in subcutaneous (p ,1.12 Ã 10 â8) and visceral (p ,1.23 Ã 10 â6) adipose tissue.

We next used a Bayesian ï¬ne mapping approach (FINEMAP) to generate credible sets at each locus that capture 99% of the posterior probability that the causal SNP(s) are in that SNP set (i.e., the â99% credible set â). We found that for 215 of the 346 (~62%) in the combined sample, FINEMAP identi ï¬ed only 1 likely causal SNP. A similar proportion of the women only and men only loci were most likely to contain only 1 causal SNP. Finally, we tested to see if our credible sets were enriched in genomic annotations via ENCODE and the Roadmap Consortium. We found that SNPs in credible sets derived1058from the GWAS of WHRadjBMI in men were enriched in ChIP seq binding tracks for EZH2, a component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 implicated in the adipo  genesis pathway.

Haplotype dependent allele speci ï¬c DNA methylation (hap ASM) is a pervasive phenomenon thatreï¬ects cis acting effects of local DNA sequences on local CpG methylation patterns in human cells and tissues. Differential DNA methylation in Down syndrome (DS DM)is an interesting trans acting effect, in which the presence of the extra chromosome 21 leads to recurrent changes in CpG methylation patterns at loci distributed throughout thegenome. I will brie ï¬y cover both topics, emphasizing the practical utility of hap ASM mapping as a post GWASapproach for homing in on mechanistically informative disease associated regulatory sequence variants, and the analysis of DS DM to test mechanistic hypotheses for how DNA methylation patterns are shaped in mammalian genomes.

3312,129, Metabolomic pro ï¬ling of ANGPTL3 de ï¬ciency,C10.4,,"Introduction: Loss of function variants in the angiopoietin like 3 gene ( ANGPTL3 ) have been associated with low levels of plasma lipoproteins and decreased coronary artery disease risk. We aimed to determinedetailed metabolic effects of genetically induced ANGPTL3 deï¬ciency in fasting and postprandial state. Materials and Methods: We studied individuals carry  ing S17X loss of function mutation in ANGPTL3 (6 homo  zygous and 32 heterozygous carriers) and 38 noncarriers. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used toquantify 225 circulating metabolic measures. We compared metabolic differences between loss of function carriers and noncarriers in fasting state and after a high fat meal. Results: In fasting, ANGPTL3 de ï¬ciency was char  acterized by similar extent of reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.74 SD units lower concentrationper loss of function allele [95%CI 0.42 â1.06]) as observed for many triglyceride rich lipoprotein measures, including very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.75 [0.45 â1.05]). Within most lipoprotein subclasses, absolute levels of cholesterol were decreased more than triglycerides, result ing in the relative proportion of cholesterol being reducedwithin triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, beta hydroxybutyrate was elevated (0.55 [0.21 â0.89]). Homozygous ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers showed essentially no postprandial increase in triglyceride rich lipoproteins and fatty acids, without evi  dence for adverse compensatory metabolic effects. Conclusion: In addition to overall triglyceride and low  density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering effects, ANGPTL3 deï¬ciency results in reduction of cholesterol proportion within triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers had elevated ketone body production, suggesting enhanced hepatic fattyacid beta oxidation. The detailed metabolic pro ï¬le in human knockouts of ANGPTL3 reinforces inactivation of ANGPTL3 as a promising therapeutic target for decreasingcardiovascular risk. E. Tikkanen: A.

Although these discoveries rely on genetic variation present across individuals, association studies have overwhelminglybeen performed in populations of European descent. In light of differential genetic architecture between populations, biased representation in research can exacer bate existing disease and health care disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they are at a low frequency or completely absent in European populations, especially astheï¬eld shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population speci ï¬c. More concerning, the effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derivedin one population will not accurately extrapolate to other populations. Herein, we describe our recent work of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, where we have conducted a GWAS of 26 cardio  metabolic phenotypes in 49,839 non European individuals.We identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known cardiometabolic loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalog associations across these traits. Our datashows strong evidence of effect size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantialbeneï¬ts for ï¬ne mapping using diverse cohorts, and insights into clinical implications. We fear that the lack of repre  sentation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. Thus, we strongly advocate for continued, large genome wide efforts indiverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities. G.L. Wojcik: None. M. Graff: None. K.

3312,129, Metabolomic pro ï¬ling of ANGPTL3 de ï¬ciency,C10.4,,"Introduction: Loss of function variants in the angiopoietin like 3 gene ( ANGPTL3 ) have been associated with low levels of plasma lipoproteins and decreased coronary artery disease risk. We aimed to determinedetailed metabolic effects of genetically induced ANGPTL3 deï¬ciency in fasting and postprandial state. Materials and Methods: We studied individuals carry  ing S17X loss of function mutation in ANGPTL3 (6 homo  zygous and 32 heterozygous carriers) and 38 noncarriers. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used toquantify 225 circulating metabolic measures. We compared metabolic differences between loss of function carriers and noncarriers in fasting state and after a high fat meal. Results: In fasting, ANGPTL3 de ï¬ciency was char  acterized by similar extent of reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.74 SD units lower concentrationper loss of function allele [95%CI 0.42 â1.06]) as observed for many triglyceride rich lipoprotein measures, including very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.75 [0.45 â1.05]). Within most lipoprotein subclasses, absolute levels of cholesterol were decreased more than triglycerides, result ing in the relative proportion of cholesterol being reducedwithin triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, beta hydroxybutyrate was elevated (0.55 [0.21 â0.89]). Homozygous ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers showed essentially no postprandial increase in triglyceride rich lipoproteins and fatty acids, without evi  dence for adverse compensatory metabolic effects. Conclusion: In addition to overall triglyceride and low  density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering effects, ANGPTL3 deï¬ciency results in reduction of cholesterol proportion within triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers had elevated ketone body production, suggesting enhanced hepatic fattyacid beta oxidation. The detailed metabolic pro ï¬le in human knockouts of ANGPTL3 reinforces inactivation of ANGPTL3 as a promising therapeutic target for decreasingcardiovascular risk. E. Tikkanen: A.

Although these discoveries rely on genetic variation present across individuals, association studies have overwhelminglybeen performed in populations of European descent. In light of differential genetic architecture between populations, biased representation in research can exacer bate existing disease and health care disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they are at a low frequency or completely absent in European populations, especially astheï¬eld shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population speci ï¬c. More concerning, the effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derivedin one population will not accurately extrapolate to other populations. Herein, we describe our recent work of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, where we have conducted a GWAS of 26 cardio  metabolic phenotypes in 49,839 non European individuals.We identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known cardiometabolic loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalog associations across these traits. Our datashows strong evidence of effect size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantialbeneï¬ts for ï¬ne mapping using diverse cohorts, and insights into clinical implications. We fear that the lack of repre  sentation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. Thus, we strongly advocate for continued, large genome wide efforts indiverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities. G.L. Wojcik: None. M. Graff: None. K.

Methods: We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 141 lipid species in 2,181 individuals, followed by phenome wide scans (PheWAS) with 23 CVDend points in >500,000 individuals from the Finnish and UK Biobanks. We also determined (1) how heritable are lipid species and do they share genetic components and (2)could we gain mechanistic insights into lipid metabolism. Results: SNP based heritabilities for lipid species ranged from 10 â54%. Long polyunsaturated lipids showed highest heritability and genetic sharing, suggesting considerable genetic regulation at fatty acids levels. The observed low genetic sharing between traditional lipids and lipid speciessuggested that routine lipid screens may fail to capture potential disease risk factors. GWAS identi ï¬ed 35 lipid  species associated loci (P < 5x10 â8), with 15 new lipid loci and 37 new SNP lipid species pair associations e.g. asso  ciation between ABCG5/8 and CE(20:2;0). We show that LPL (lipoprotein lipase) may have more ef ï¬cient hydrolysis of medium length TAGs (triacylglycerides) than other TAGs. The association patterns of SYNGR1, MIR100HG , andPTPRN2 suggested their probable roles in desaturation and/or elongation of fatty acids. PheWAS revealed that 7 of 35 lipid species associated loci also associate with CVD related outcomes, including ABCG5/8 ,APOA1 ,BLK, FADS2 ,LPL, and two new loci  COL5A1 and GALNT16 (false discovery rate <0.05). Conclusion: We demonstrate that lipidomics enable deeper insights to the genetic regulation of lipid metabolismthan clinically used lipid measures, which in turn might help guide future disease biomarker discovery.

Improved discovery, by further increasing study sizes is not the only strategy. Leveraging published studies of related traits can improveinference. To this end, we developed a Bayesian GWAS approach that builds informative priors from GWASs of related risk factors. Mendelian Randomisation is used toderive multivariate causal effects of a set of iteratively selected risk factors on the target outcome. These causal effects of the risk factors on the outcome are then combinedwith the SNP âs effect on the identi ï¬ed risk factors to build a Bayesian prior for the SNP âs effects on the outcome. We found a set of universally optimal parameters (instrumentstrength, clumping stringency and shrinkage intensity) that maximizes the out of sample squared correlation betweenprior and observed effects (up to ~40%). We use Bayes Factors (BFs) to quantify the evidence in favour of the prior and derived an analytical formula for the null BFs distribution, which led to a 6 fold reduced runtime and a more accurate estimation of P values, compared to permutation based approaches. We are able to gaugegenetic risk score (GRS) performance using only summary statistics from training and test samples. Its application revealed that GRSs based on posterior effects outperformstandard GRS. Applying this technique to human lifespan, we identi ï¬ed 7 new loci ( P< 5e 8), which were missed by standard GWAS.

However, phase IIIrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, suggest an imbalance of serious cardiovascular events. Methods: We used two independent variants in SOST (encoding sclerostin) associated with bone mineral density (BMD) as proxies for therapeutic inhibition of sclerostin.We estimated the effects on risk of osteoporosis, fracture, coronary heart disease (CHD) and a further 22 cardiome  tabolic traits, by combining data from 478,967 participantsfrom three cohorts and up to 1,030,836 participants from nine GWAS consortia. In addition, we performed meta  analysis of cardiovascular outcomes from RCTs ofromosozumab. Results: RCT meta analysis identi ï¬ed a higher risk of cardiac ischaemic events in patients randomised to romo sozumab (25 events among 4,298 individuals; odds ratio [OR] 2.98; 95% con ï¬dence interval [CI], 1.18 â7.55; P , 0.017). Scaled to the equivalent dose of romosozumab(210mg/month; 0.09 g/cm 2higher BMD), the SOST var  iants associated with lower risk of fracture (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.54 â0.66; P ,1.4 Ã 10â24), and osteoporosis (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36 â0.52; P ,2.4 Ã 10â18). The SOST var  iants associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularisation (69,649 cases; OR, 1.18;95% CI, 1.06 â1.32; P ,0.003) and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05 â1.27; P ,0.003), higher systolic blood pressure (1.3mmHg; 95% CI 0.8 â1.9; P,5.9 Ã 10 â6) and waist to hip ratio adjusted for BMI (0.05 SDs; 95% CI, 0.02â0.08; P ,8.5 Ã 10â4).Conclusion: Genetically and therapeutically lowered sclerostin leads to higher risk of cardiovascular events.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels.

Themain reason is a defective glomerular ï¬ltration barrier allowing the passage of serum proteins, including albumin, into the urine. Largely overlooked, a failure of reabsorbingtheï¬ltered proteins in the proximal tubular segment can also lead to a mild tubular proteinuria, but it is unclear if it is harmful for the kidney. Here, we combine targeted andexome sequencing to explore the contribution of tubular genes to chronic subnephrotic proteinuria (0,5 3 g/24h). Altogether, we identi ï¬ed 24 patients with recessive mutations in the tubular uptake receptor cubilin ( CUBN) . Meta analyzing our in house genetic database, we further identify a signi ï¬cant association between loss of function CUBN mutations and proteinuric conditions. The tubular proteinuria in the CUBN patients was atypical, lacking important tubular proteinuria markers and consisting ofmore than 50% albumin. Importantly, the renal function was normal, even in old patients, suggesting that the proteinuria is benign. All identi ï¬ed mutations localize to the C terminal half of the protein, which is in contrast to the known N terminal Imerslund GrÃ¤sbeck mutations for CUBN featured by Vitamin B12 malabsorption in addition to the proteinuria. Some mutations have an allele frequency of 0.5% suggesting that this kind of proteinuria is not uncommon. This is supported by the gnomAD databaseshowing a high prevalence of damaging CUBN variants, mostly localizing to the C terminal half. In summary, we identify C terminal CUBN mutations as a common but benign cause of chronic proteinuria. M. Bedin: None. O. Boyer: None. A. Servais: None. L. Villoing GaudÃ©: None. O. Gribouval: None.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) liver iron, compared to circulating iron traits,permit detection of liver speci ï¬c susceptibility loci. We performed the ï¬rst GWAS of MRI determined liver iron in 8,289 individuals in UK Biobank and validated ourresults in 1,513 individuals from DIRECT. Liver iron was calculated from MRI data using LiverMultiScanTM. We used GEMMA, which corrects for relatedness and popula tion structure, and adjusted our model for age, sex, BMI and genotyping array. We identi ï¬ed three independent genetic variants (rs1800562 & rs1799945 in HFE, rs855791 in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron (P < 5x10 8). Both HFE and TMPRSS6 are involved in hepcidin production, the keyhormone responsible for iron balance in the body. We estimated the heritability of liver iron to be 7.39%. The most genetically correlated traits in LD score regressionanalysis were transferrin (rG ,â0.78) and ferritin (rG , 1.24) with nominal signi ï¬cant correlation. In our Mendelian randomisation analysis, we found some evidence that highercentral obesity, measured as waist to hip ratio, is casually associated with higher liver iron content (IVW P ,0.003). Phenome wide association analysis demonstrates sharedaetiology of elevated liver iron with high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, extrahepatic malignancies, neuropsychiatric, endocrine and rheumatological conditions, and an inverseassociation with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease. Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying excess liver iron are likely systemic not organ speciï¬c. Our data provides new insights into the biology of liver iron and its link to metabolic and non metabolic dis ease outcomes.H.R. Wilman: None. C.A. Parisinos: None. N. Ata  baki pasdar: None. M.

3331,202, A transcriptome wide Mendelian randomization study to uncover tissue dependent regulatory mechanismsacross the human phenome,C25.1,,"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, United KingdomBackground: Developing insight into tissue speci ï¬c tran  scriptional mechanisms can help improve our understanding of how genetic variants exert their effects on complex traits and disease. By applying the principles of Mendelian randomization, we have undertaken a systematic analysis to evaluate transcriptome wide associations between geneexpression and 395 complex traits across 48 different tissue types. Results: Overall, we identi ï¬ed 59,810 gene trait asso  ciations in at least 1 tissue type based on multiple testing and genetic colocalization corrections. These results indi  cate that genetic effects expressed more ubiquitously acrossdifferent tissues are more likely to be pleiotropic (i.e. associated with multiple diverse phenotypes). We have also explored these results in detail with a series of analyses thathighlight tissue dependent effects. For instance, TPO, NR3C2 andSPATA13 expression was only associated with thyroid disease in thyroid tissue, whereas FBN2 was asso  ciated with both cardiovascular and lung function traits but only when analysed in heart and lung tissue respectively. We also demonstrate that phenome wide investigations of our results can be valuable for drug validation purposes. Finally, we have evaluated the tissue dependency of ï¬nd  ings from genome wide association studies (GWAS). Thissuggested that integrating tissue speci ï¬c data with GWAS results can help elucidate the causal genes and tissues responsible for effects, as well uncover putative novelï¬ndings. Conclusion: The atlas of tissue dependent associations we have constructed should prove extremely insightful tofuture studies investigating the genetic determinants of complex disease.

Results of previous research suggest that susceptibility to ACEi induced angioedema (ACEi AE) isdependent on a genetic predisposition and non genetic risk factors. However, as the biological mechanisms contribut  ing to these angioedema are still largely unknown, furtherresearch is needed. The aim of the present study was to investigate common and rare genetic variation in ACEi AE patients. In a targeted sequencing approach, we investi gated the occurrence rate of known pathogenic mutations associated with monogenic forms of angioedema in 69 German and 68 Danish patients with ACEi AE. All sam ples were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform using single molecule molecular inversion probes. InAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 823addition, all samples were genotyped on the Illumina Inï¬nium Global Screening Array to identify common genetic variants contributing to angioedema risk under ACEi. Analysis of the sequencing data revealed no known pathogenic mutations in genes associated with the mono  genic forms of angioedema. However, we identi ï¬ed 19 other rare (MAF â¤0.05), non synonymous variants for which a contribution to ACEi AE risk cannot be excluded. Quality control and imputation of the array data is currentlyongoing. Furthermore, we are currently applying the above investigation strategies to an independent Swedish sample (n,77). Follow up of the variants identi ï¬ed by targeted sequencing in larger patient samples as well as subsequent biostatistics/ informatics analyses of the GWAS data will help to gain further insights into the underlying molecularmechanisms of ACEi AE.

Ammosov North  Eastern Federal University, Yakutsk, Russian Federation, 2Medical Genetic Center, Republican Hospital â1â Â«National Medical CenterÂ», Yakutsk, Russian Federation Introduction: Biallelic mutations in the NBAS gene have been reported to cause three different clinical signs: shortstature with optic nerve atrophy and Pelger HuÃ«t anomaly (SOPH) syndrome, infantile liver failure syndrome 2 (ILFS2) and a combined severe phenotype including bothSOPH and ILFS2 features. Material and Methods: Here, we describe a case of a 6  year old Yakut girl who presented with clinical signs ofSOPH syndrome, acute liver failure (ALF) and bone fragility by the type of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Targeted panel sequencing for 494 genes of connectivetissue diseases was performed on our patient. To predict the protein damaging effects of the suspected pathogenic variations in NBAS, three different software programs wereused: Polyphen 2, SIFT, MutationTaster. Results: The molecular genetic study revealed the known heterozygous variant c.5741G>A (p.Arg1914His) in 45exon of NBAS. Also, in 23 exon of NBAS was identi ï¬ed a previously unreported missense heterozygous variant838 J. del Picchiac.2535G>T (p.Trp845Cys). Mutation affect evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues and predicted to be highly damaging. Conclusion: Timely health care of patients with such a set of clinical spectrum of SOPH syndrome, ALF and bone fragility can contribute to establishment coordinated multi specialty management of the patient focusing on the health problems issues through childhood.

De novo missense variants in this gene have been linked to developmental disorders (DD) in a large scale study ofpatients with severe undiagnosed DD (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Only ï¬ve patients have been reported to date and clinical data remains very scarce. We report a new patientwith COL4A3BP  related intellectual disability (ID) aiming to contribute to the recognition of this condition. Materials and methods: Clinical data was collected from the patient âs medical records and compared with previous reports from scienti ï¬c literature and databases. Results: A 5 year old girl with unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery, presented with postnatal microcephaly, axial hypotonia, and severe global864 J. del Picchiadevelopmental delay. Short stature and facial dysmorphisms were noted and, at 24 months, she developed generalized seizures. Currently, she does not walk unaided, says only one word, and has poor visual contact and marked stereotypic behavior with bruxism. Whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a de novo pathogenic variant in COL4A3BP (S260L). Conclusions: This missense variant was previously found in 4 out of 5 known patients, suggesting a mutational hotspot in this gene. Former functional evidence indicates itresults in intracellular imbalances in ceramide, pivotal to the synthesis of sphingolipids. Our case has signi ï¬cant overlap with clinical data from previous patients.

Aloulou, S. Mallek, S. Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ï¬lled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen  tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ï¬nally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ï¬ve cardinal manifestations of KB deï¬ned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ï¬nitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ï¬rmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N.B. Abdelmoula: B.

3385,341, Low density oligonucleotide microarray for the detec tion of ethnospeci ï¬c mutations causing ï¬ve genetic disorders prevalent among the Yakut population,P16.08,,"tion In yakut population of republic of Sakha (Yakutia) serious genetic disorders occur with relatively high frequency. Thereis a pressing need for comprehensive carrier screening and molecular diagnostic, but methods of genetic diagnostics that commonly used today are not able to afford it due to the highcost and time consumption for a single test. For such pur  poses, we developed an ethnicity speci ï¬c assay based on DNA microarray. Microarray is designed to address mostprevalent mutations among yakut population: 4582_4583insT inCUL7 gene,Ñ.5741G >Ai n NBAS gene,Ñ.806Ð¡>Ð¢inDIA1 gene, c.1090G>C in FAH gene, c. 23 +1G>A in GBJ2 gene causing 3 M syndrome, SOPH syndrome, Tyrosinemia type 1, Methaemoglobinaemia type 1, Nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness (DFNB1) type 1A respectively. Oligonucleotideprobes printed onto aldehyde group coated glass slides using non contact microarrayer. The assay based on reverse hybri  dization, which include two step multiplex PCR reactionswith production of one stranded Cy5 labeled PCR products following its hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. Using this microarray, we estimated heterozygose carrier frequencyin 120 healthy people of yakut ethnicity and validated data by real time PCR and PCR RLFP methods. The evaluation of this microarray demonstrates that it is comprehensive, robust,sensitive, speci ï¬c, and easily modi ï¬able. The developed assay can be considered as an alternative cost effective tool for genetic screening purposes and it is suitable for both carrierscreening and disease diagnostics in yakut population in the republic of Sakha (Yakutia).

However, the gene regulatory landscape of the hypothalamus remainsunclear. We characterized the physical relationships among gene promoters and their corresponding cis regulatory ele  ments in human embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived hypo thalamic cells by integrating RNA seq, ATAC seq and promoter focused Capture C pro ï¬les. We conducted thiseffort in an in vitro model of hypothalamic neurons using human ESCs at 3 stages of differentiation: ESCs, hypo  thalamic progenitors (HPs) and hypothalamic like neurons (HNs). We identi ï¬ed 87,170 open chromatin regions (OCRs) contacting promoters in at least 1 stage of HN differentiation. Interestingly, we observed that regardless ofgene expression pattern during differentiation, overall accessibility of interacting OCRs ï¬rst increased during the transition to HP, then decreased following differentiation toHN. In order to relate these ï¬ndings to GWAS data, we tested for enrichment of SNPs within promoter interacting OCRs. We found signi ï¬cant associations with BMI, sleep traits, age at menarche (AAM) and major depressive dis  order (MDD). We mapped these trait associated variants to their physically interacting genes. We identi ï¬ed 2 putative effector genes for AAM ( RPS26 andSUOX ) and 1 for BMI (DHRS11 ), which were also supported by colocalized hypothalamus eQTLs in GTEx. Additionally, HyPrColocanalyses revealed several putative effector genes associated with >1 trait, including ZRANB2 for AAM, BMI and MDD, andFEZF1 for AAM and BMI. Taken together, our ana  lyses provide insight into cis regulatory architecture during hypothalamic development and how it may contribute to hypothalamus associated phenotypes.

Since then, many related methods have been proposed (e.g, methods forestimating heritability enrichments, genetic correlations and confounding bias), that allow us to further interrogate the genetic architecture of complex traits. I will begin by providing an introduction to the ï¬eld, and describing methods that use individual level data. Then I will discuss the second generation methods, that requireonly GWAS summary statistics (and thus allow us to analyze ever increasing amounts of data). I will explain how a crucial feature of all methods is the choice ofheritability model, which re ï¬ects our prior information about the relative contributions of different SNPs. I will ï¬nish by providing examples not only of how these methods have improved our understanding of complex traits (e.g., allowed us to determine which types of SNPs are most important, and to infer the impact of selection), buthow this information can be utilized in other areas of statistical genetics (e.g., to enable us to produce more accurate polygenic risk scores).

The population  wide cohort of FinnGen offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate phenotype associa tions of rare variants because the founding bottleneck of Finland concentrates them to h igher population frequencies. This âFinnish disease heritage âapplies particularly to recessive variants. Here, we studied rec essive, dominant and additive effects of 82,516 coding variants on 2,264 disease endpoints using nation wide electronic health record data of 176,899Finns. Globally, variant effe cts in different GWAS models were in agreement with inherita nce modes of the respective genes in OMIM (recessive, dominant or âbothâ). However, there were many exceptions e.g. 33 genes listed only as recessive in OMIM had coding va riants with dominant asso  ciations (p < 10 â7). One example was XPA (recessive disease: Xeroderma pigmentosa), where a heterozygous truncating variant was associated with skin cancer (p ,8Ã1 0â11,b e t a, 1.24). Another example was a variant in SCN5A associated with sick sinus syndrome in recessive state. Interestingly, in heterozygous form it had a protective effect for cardiac arrhythmia phenotypes (p ,2Ã1 0â8,b e t a,â0.48, repli  cated in UK Biobank with p ,0.04, beta ,â0.39). Our data also included 6794 coding variants listed in ClinVar. We found signi ï¬cantly more phenotype associations than for random intergenic variants in 498 (likely) pathogenic/con  ï¬icting, but also 4019 âbenign âvariants in dominant and recessive genes.

Runz2 1EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany,2Biogen Inc., Cambridge, MA, United States Introduction: Genetic Interactions (GIs), where variants in two genes collectively cause non additive phenotypes dif  ferent from the sum of the variants âindividual effects, are considered a foundational element in the genetic archi tecture of complex traits. In humans, however, GIs have remained largely elusive. Here, we combined exome  sequencing and genotyping in the UK Biobank with sys tematic cell based RNA interference (RNAi) to assess whether GIs between lipid genes contribute to changes inplasma lipid levels as risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and Methods: We systematically tested for modi ï¬er effects between 30 lipid  regulatory genes derived from GWAS loci associated with plasma LDL, HDL, TG, TC or CAD using robust linear model ï¬tting with three complementary data types: pr otein truncating variants (PTVs) from whole exome sequencing of 161,508 UK Biobank participants; GWAS lead SNPs from 378,033UK Biobank participants; and results from a combinator  ial RNAi screen measuring cellular LDL uptake. Results: We show that additive effects between lipid genes are pervasive, consistent with the use of summed effect sizes in polygenic risk scores. Yet, all three approaches also indicated existence of non additive GIs,with one GI identi ï¬ed from PTV based, 26 from SNP  based, and 20 from cell based analyses, respectively. Integrating genetic and functional data validated threeGIs as modulating both plasma lipid levels and cellular uptake. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional analyses propose distinct gene pairs that modulate plasma and cellular lipid levels via additive and non additive effects. Our results can help prioritize drug target pairs forthe development of lipid lowering combination therapies. M. Zimon: None. Y. Huang: A. Employment (full or part  time); Signi ï¬cant; Biogen Inc.

Bowden1, J. Alegre Abarrategui1,R . Wade Martins1,C. Webber2,1* 1Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom,2UK Demen  tia Research Institute, Cardiff, United Kingdom We sequenced ~ 17,000 nuclei from both the Cortex and Substantia Nigra (SN) of ï¬ve human brains and generated theï¬rst human single nuclei transcriptomic atlas of the SN, a region playing important roles in reward and movement. By mapping genetic variants associated with different human traits to SN cell type speci ï¬c gene expression pat  terns, we demonstrate for the ï¬rst time that Parkinson âs disease (PD) genetic risk, for which the symptoms are caused by loss of SN dopaminergic neurons (DaNs), isindeed associated with DaN speci ï¬c gene expression affecting pathways such as mitochondrial organisation and functioning, protein ubiquitination and vesicle transport.However, we also identify a distinct cell type association between PD risk and oligodendrocyte speci ï¬c gene expression. Unlike Alzheimer âs disease (AD), we ï¬nd no association between PD risk and microglia or astrocytes, suggesting that neuroin ï¬ammation plays a less causal role in PD than AD. Beyond PD, we ï¬nd other neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia (SCZ), to be associated to SN DaNs and GABAergic neurons. Nevertheless, we ï¬nd that each neuropsychiatric disorder is associated with adistinct set of genes within those neuronal types. On the contrary, we ï¬nd an overlapping component of risk between neuropsychiatric disorders in the association to glial cells,particularly oligo precursor cells (OPCs). This atlas pro  vides the ï¬rst objective associations between genetic risk of multiple disorders and the midbrain cell types these riskslikely manifest through, thereby directing our aetiological understanding.

XCE is one of the most frequent epilepsies. It is a disorder ofcellular mosaics, i.e. hete rozygous females (due to X  inactivation mosaicism) or postzygotic somatic mosaic males. Hemizygous males without functional PCDH19are not affected. In the present study we investigated the complexity of the XCE NDD phenotype as well as the cellular and molecular determinants of its variable(~80%) penetrance. Firstly, using standardized survey tools we have assessed executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory) and psychiatric comorbidities (SocialResponsiveness Scale, Social Communication Ques  tionnaire, Strengths and Dif ï¬culties Questionnaire, and Dimensional Obsessive Compulsive Scale) on 112 indi viduals with deleterious PCDH19 variant, males and females. Genetic, seizure, an d developmental information were also collected. Developmental delay prior to seizureonset occurred in 18%, executive dysfunction and ASD in 60% of individuals. 21% of in dividuals met criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, distinct from ASD. There were no phenotypic differences between heterozygous females and somatic mosaic ma les attesting to the cellular mosaicism as the disease dri ver. Secondly, we assessed 322 PCDH19 missense variants, 45 of which we tested experimentally using in vitro assays to engineer a highaccuracy PCDH19 variant predictor toolbox. Thirdly, using patient derived skin ï¬broblast cell lines we identi  ï¬ed genetic (mRNA, protein) and epigenetic (methyla  tion) biomarkers of the penetrance of XCE even among discordant monozygotic twins .

Snyder1 1Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany,3University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States Physical interactions between distal regulatory elements in the genome play a key role in regulating gene expression, yet the extent to which these interactions vary between cell types andcontribute to cell type speci ï¬cg e n ee x p r e s s i o na n dh o wt h e y are related to overall gene function remains unclear. To address these questions as part of ENCODE Phase III, we mappedcohesin mediated chromatin loops, using a high resolution ChIA PET assay, and gene expression in 24 diverse human cell types, including core ENCODE cell lines. We ï¬nd that 28% of all chromatin loops vary across cell types, and these changes are effective at grouping cell types based on their tissue of origin, indicating commonalities in three dimensional(3D) genome architecture amongst related cell types. This also applied to different cell types that were derived from the same individual, demonstrating that the observed variation is mainlydue to epigenetic changes. Cell type speci ï¬c loops show dif  ferent patterns of chromatin states, with stem cell loops being depleted of active promoter states and transcription, and enri  ched in bivalent states. We further ï¬nd that the connectivity of genes corresponds to different functional classes, with house keeping genes being connected by few loops, and dosage  sensitive genes being highly connected to enhancer elements. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic variants identi ï¬ed in GWAS are enriched in variable loops in disease relevant cell types. Overall, our results provide important insights on how variation in 3D chromatin organization correspondsto cell type speci ï¬c functions and identity. F. Grubert: None. R. Srivas: None. D.

O âMara QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia We have previously identi ï¬ed 11 joint risk endometrial  ovarian cancer loci through analysis of genome wide association study (GWAS) data from the two largest studies of these diseases. To ï¬nd candidate target genes at joint risk loci, we performed HiChIP chromatin looping analysis of three endometrial and three ovarian cancer cell lines. To enrich for enhancer promoter interactions, a mechanismthrough which GWAS identi ï¬ed variation may target genes, we captured loops associated with H3K27Ac histone (characteristic of promoters and enhancers). We identi ï¬ed 60,208 182,001 replicated loops per cell line, 28 44% of which contacted a promoter. Intersection of promoter  associated loops with statistically credible risk variantshighlighted 59 genes, at eight joint risk loci, as candidate targets in both endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines. These genes included those with well established oncogenicroles (e.g. TERT ,MYC andCCND1 ). Among the candidate target genes, there was a two fold enrichment (p ,0.01) for genes differentially expressed in endometrial or ovariantumours. Network analysis prioritised a set of proteins that interact with those encoded by candidate target genes. This set was 16 fold enriched (p ,2Ã10 â15) for endometrial or ovarian cancer drivers and included proteins encoded by mismatch repair genes MLH1 ,MSH2 andMSH6 , for which variants are penetrant for endometrial cancer and ovariancancer. Lastly, candidate target genes and prioritised inter  acting proteins were over represented in pathways related to endometrial and ovarian cancer development. In summary, we have identi ï¬ed biologically relevant candidate genes and pathways, providing insight into endometrial and ovariancancer aetiology.

Recent studies highlight the existence of structural andregulatory domains orchestrating the organised expression of nearby genes (Delaneau et al. 2019 Science 364(6439)). Yet, the molecular mechanisms, genetic control and tissuespeciï¬city of local gene co expression are far from being understood. Here, we developed a novel method to identify groups of nearby genes (within 1Mb) that are co expressed,using genome wide RNA seq datasets from large popula  tions (e.g. >200 individuals). First, we identi ï¬ed 9548 high  conï¬dence co expressed gene pairs (FDR 1%) from 358 human lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) samples from the Geuvadis dataset. These constitute 52.5% of the protein  coding and lincRNA genes expressed in LCLs, demon strating that local gene co expression is highly prevalent. Next, by integrating various molecular assays (e.g. ChIP  seq, Hi C), we determined the relative contribution ofseveral molecular features towards local gene co expres  sion. For instance, we found that CTCF binding plays a role in determining which gene pairs can be co expressed,whereas chromatin contacts between genes shown to be key only when these are distant (>200kb) from each other. Notably, developing novel QTL mapping approaches, wefound that the co expression of more than 50% of the gene pairs is controlled by nearby genetic variants (co QTLs), many of whom falling within shared regulatory elements, such as enhancers. Finally, we applied our novel approaches across 53 human GTEx tissues to study in depth the tissue speciï¬city and genetic control of local gene co expression, ultimately improving the functional interpretation of QTL and GWAS ï¬ndings.

Pre synaptic disorders, characterized bycongenital nystagmus and photophobia, night blindness, are known as cone rod synaptic disorder (CRSD) can be mis  taken for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Full  ï¬eld electroretinogram is crucial for the differential diagnosis, but it can be dif ï¬cult to perform in young children. Here, we report (i) the identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in the RIMS2 gene encoding a pre synaptic protein not yet asso  ciated with human diseases in 3/4 families initially referred for LCA and (ii) the diagnostic adjustment to CRSD withvariable associated alteration including autistic behavior and insulinopathy. Methods : Exome sequencing combined with targeted RIMS2 testing were performed in 46 prescreened patients with CRSD and 94 with LCA. Biallelic RIMS2 mutated cases underwent ophthalmologic, neurologic and metabolicassessment. RIMS2 immunostaining was performed on human retina, brain and pancreas. Nonsense variants were functionally investigated in mammalian cells. Results.Biallelic RIMS2 sequence variants were found in four unrelated families. RIMS2, a protein regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis localizes in the human retinal outerplexiform layer, Purkinje cells and pancreatic islets. Apart from CRSD, neurodevelopmental disease was observed in all cases, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in the eldestpatient.?Nonsense variants lead to truncated RIMS2 and decreased insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Conclusion : This is the ï¬rst report of syndromic CRSD with neurodevelopmental or pancreatic involvement due to RIMS2 loss of function.

Perez Jurado5 1Barcelona Institute for Global Health, BARCELONA, Spain,2Barcelona Supercomputing Center, BARCELONA,Spain,3Broad Institute, BOSTON, MA, United States, 4University of Tartu, BARCELONA, Estonia,5Universitat Pompeu Fabra, BARCELONA, Spain Background: The burden of several common diseases including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and depression is increasing in most world populations. Themechanisms underlying the numerous epidemiological and genetic correlations among these disorders remain largely unknown. Genomic inversions can alter the function ofgenes by multiple mechanisms affecting several diseases. Its impact remained largely unknown because they were dif  ï¬cult to genotype in large cohorts. Methods: We performed an inversion association analysis including 21 inversions and 25 obesity related traits, on a total of 408,898 Europeans, and validated theresults in 67,299 independent individuals. Inversion calling was performed using our scoreInvHap tool that uses exiting GWAS data. Results: Seven inversions were associated with multiple diseases while inversions and inversions 8p23.1, 16p11.2 and 11q13.2 were strongly associated with the co occurrence of obesity with other common diseases. Transcriptome analysis across numerous tissues revealed strong candidate genes of obesity related traits. Analyses inhuman pancreatic islets indicated the potential mechanism of inversions in the susceptibility of diabetes by disrupting the cis regulatory effect of SNPs from their target genes. Conclusions: We report the largest association study of genomic inversions and human traits that represents a breakthrough for genomic association of comorbid dis orders. Inversions have major genetic contribution into the joint susceptibility to common diseases. The results in obesity and diabetes reveal a mechanism in which cis regulatory SNPs are separated from their target genes by inversion breakpoints. Future studies in other diseases are now accessible to the research community thanks to our inversion genotyping tool. J. R. Gonzalez: None. C. Ruiz: None. A. Caceres: None. I. Moran: None. M.

Stevens Kroef, G. van der Zande, D. Smeets, A. Hoischen Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen, Netherlands Recently, we raised the question whether the Bionano genome  imaging technology would have potential to replace all, FISH, karyotyping and CNV microarr ay studies, in the analysis of somatic aberrations for different kind of leukemia samples.1 Here we aimed to test the clinical utility of this technology forthe analysis of constitutional aberrations in DNA derived fromvarious tissues. We analyzed samples with known aberrations of patients with infertility, recurrent abortions or intellectual disability, as well as prenata l samples by genome imaging. For 30 samples, ultra high molecular weight gDNA was isolated either from blood (EDTA/Heparin) or cell lines (ï¬broblasts/amniotic ï¬uid/chorionic villi). DNA was pro  cessed and imaged on the Saphyr instrument (Bionano Genomics). 1For each sample at least 100x genome coverage was obtained. Using Bionano Access software,de novo genome assembly, SV and CNV variant calling and annotation was performed. Sample preparation for all different materials was successful. Data analysis on average resulted in ~50 rare SVs and ~20 high conï¬dence CNVs per sample. In the analyzed cases, all previously clinically reported structural aberrations weredetected except for Robertsonian translocations, as expectedfor the current technology. Correctly detected aberrations included 8 microdeletions and 8 dup lications, 11 translocations, 1 inversion and 4 aneuploidies. Bionano genome imaging is a promising technology with potential to become a generic cytogenetic test for all types of (molecular )cytogenetic aberrations. The 10.000 time higherresolution as compared to standard karyotyping thereby enables precise breakpoint mapping and strikingly, even balanced translocations and inversions are picked up easily. 1.

It is not known whether whole exome sequencing (WES) or GWAS followed by target gene mapping can better identify causalgenes for this disease. To compare these approaches, we ï¬rst identi ï¬ed a set of 54 positive control genes whose perturbation causes a Mendelian form of osteoporosis, orwhich act as drug targets for approved therapies. We undertook sequence kernel association tests (SKATO) to associate 18,350 autosomal protein coding genes withestimated bone mineral density (eBMD), using WES dataof 42,404 white British participants from UK Biobank and performed a GWAS in the same sample. We found that WES identi ï¬ed genes were more strongly enri  ched for positive control genes (odds ratio [OR] ,119, P,5.2 Ã 10 â6), and this enrichment was 5 fold higher compared to enrichment of GWAS identi ï¬ed genes (OR , 22.5, P ,5Ã1 0â5). From WES data, we identi ï¬ed 38 genes with exonic variants with functional impact that collectively associated with eBMD, one of the most prominent geneswasCADM1 (SKATO, P ,1.8 Ã 10 â9). We used CRISPR  Cas9 to knockout (KO) CADM1 in SaOS 2 osteoblast cell lines, suppressing protein abundance at the cell surface,which resulted in increased expression of early bone mar  kers: RUNX2 ,COL1A1/ 2 and ALPL . We previously demonstrated that Cadm1 KO mice had reduced bone mineral content ( 3.2 standard deviations [SD]) and strength ( 2.0 SD) compared to wildtype. These ï¬ndings demon  strate that WES is a powerful approach to identify genesinï¬uencing bone density, such as CADM1 , which could serve as targets for osteoporosis therapies. S. Zhou: None. L.

Introduction: Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that can be isolatedor syndromic. Biallelic ALDH1A3 variants are responsible for 11% of recessive AM cases, mostly described in consanguineous families, and present severe bilateral AM with variable neurodevelopmen tal anomalies. We present six families with biallelic ALDH1A3 variants, further characterising the associated phenotype. Material and Methods: AM individuals from UK, France and Spain were analysed by WES, targeted gene screening and arrays. Results: We identi ï¬ed 6 families: Family 1) with two brothers with bilateral anophthalmia, one present additional developmen tal delay, absent speech and autism with compound heterozygousALDH1A3 variants (c.874G>T:p.(D292Y);c.1393A>T:p.(I465F)); 2) a boy with bilateral anophthalmia, developmental and intellectual delay, seizures and autistic features with compound heterozygous variants (c.845G>C:p.(G282A);c.1459A>G:p.(R487G)); 3) a girl withbilateral microphthalmia and coloboma with compound hetero zygous variants (c.847_849del;p.(G283del);c.953C>A,:p.(S318Y)); 4) a girl with bilateral anophthalmia with a homozygous missense variant (c.1144G>A:p.(G382R)); 5) a boy with bilateral microphthal mia, unilateral coloboma and cataract, with a homozygous splice variant (c.1233 +2T>C) and 6) a boy with bilateral microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, facial dysmorphism with ahomozygous missense variant (c.434C>T:p.A145V). Conclusions: Three of the six families presented with com pound heterozygous variants, highlighting this mode of inheri tance in ALDH1A3 related disorders. Five of 6 families had a variant in the catalytic domain, supporting the importance of this domain,which is critical for substrate selectivity.

Introduction: Type IV collagen related nephropathy covers a spectrum of hereditary hematuric diseases (thin basementmembrane nephropathy, TBMN; Alport syndrome, AS). Whereas AS results from disease causing variants in COL4A3 5 (autosomal recessive and X linked AS), monoallelic disease causing variants inCOL4A3/4 are associated with TBMN. Methods: Variants of 96 index cases reported between 2009 and 2014 with the clinical tentative diagnosis AS (77/96), TBMN (13/96) or unclear determination of AS/TBMN (6/96) weremeticulously reinterpreted based on ACMG criteria and current amendments. Monoallelic (likely) pathogenic variants in COL4A3 /4 in an AS case were not considered as diagnostic, as thedesignation âautosomal dominant AS âis contested. 6 cases had to be excluded from further analysis due to limited data. Results: In total, 84 variants (allocated to 96 cases) and their genotypes have been reassessed ( COL4A3 : 21/84, COL4A4 : 18/84, COL4A5 : 45/84). 64/90 cases included in the further analysis could be classi ï¬ed as solved (original report: 83/90; p< 0.001, Fisher exact test). 26/90 were classi ï¬ed as ânot solved â(original report: 7/ 90), due to inconclusive results on variant (11/90), on genotype(12/90) or both variant and genotype level (3/90). Conclusions: Transparent and coherent variant /genotype interpretation enables physicians to diagnose hereditary diseasesand allows them to provide patients with well founded informa tion concerning prognosis and recurrence risk. This is especially true for type IV collagen related nephropathy, covering an intri cate phenotypic and genotypic spectrum. Since reassessment ofvariants/genotypes in this study showed a signi ï¬cant reduction in genetic diagnoses, reports on type IV collagen related nephro pathy obtained in the pre ACMG era should be critically evaluated.",2021.0,,K.M.

K. Williams1 1King âs College London, London, United Kingdom,2Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation,3PolyOmica, âs Hertogen bosch, Netherlands,4University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. Background: Chronic back pain (CBP) is more common among females for reasons not fully understood. We hypothesized that sitting to standing height ratio, known to be different betweenthe sexes, may contribute. Methods: We used European individuals from UK Biobank (project #18219) comprising 222,361 males and 263,602 femalesto test this hypothesis. Logistic regression was used to assess theassociation of CBP with sitting height, standing height, and their ratio while adjusting for age, BMI, and job involving prolonged standing and heavy lifting. Mediation analysis and Mendelianrandomization (MR) were applied to assess causality. Instrumentsfor MR were selected from publicly available GWAS data for sitting to standing height ratio, ensuring non overlap with chronic BP GWAS using UK Biobank. Results: Both sitting and standing height exhibited a weak association of similar magnitude for CBP in both sexes (Table). However, sitting to standing height ratio was associated with greater odd of CBP in males (Table) but with lower odds in females(Table). Mediation analysis showed both direct and BMI mediated risk effects of the ratio on CBP in males; while in females there was BMI mediated risk effect and direct protective effect. MRsupported a causal impact of sitting to standing height ratio onCBP risk in females, but not in males.Abstracts from the 54thEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference 157 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:88 â 608Conclusion: We provide evidence that different body propor tions seen in men and women may contribute to the different risk of CBP between the sexes.

Non syndromic cleft lip with/wi thout cleft palate (nsCL/P) is a common multifactorial disorde r with strong genetic contribu tion. Here, we systematically investigate the contribution of de novo mutations (DNMs) to nsCL/P risk, using whole genome sequence (WGS) data for 211 nsCL /P and 284 non cleft reference trios from the Kids First Project. For the total set of 31,490 DNMs, overall comparison between cohorts did not show conclusive differences, neither in absolut e numbers nor when weighted for different functional scores. However, we observed nominallysigni ï¬cant accumulation of non coding DNMs at bivalent TSS/ enhancer chromatin states in nsCL/P during human embryonic face development at Carnegie Stage 15 (p ,0.0269), and a nominally signi ï¬cant enrichment of non coding DNMs in topologically associating domains at two GWAS risk loci, i.e. 4q28.1 (7 cases, 0 controls, p ,0.0008) and 2p21 PKDCC (7 cases, 2 controls, p ,0.0161). We ï¬nally used transcription factor (TF) binding information to identify TFs with potential key role in nsCL/P etiology. Based on position weight matrices, we predicted TF binding sites for 810 human TFs, and calculatedchanges of binding capacity at 28,773 DNM sites. We observed asigni ï¬cant enrichment of DNM hits for motif TFAP2A in nsCL/P, and identi ï¬edATF3 ,MSC and HES5/7 as potential TF candidates. Notably, for MSC and ATF3 ,t h i s ï¬nding was supported by a strong quantitative effect on the predicted binding change, which for MSC is currently validated using in vitro assays. Our study provides novel insights into nsCL/P etiology and suggestsa TF based approach that can be used to annotate non codingrisk variants from WGS data.",2021.0,,H.K. Zieger: None. L.

Introduction: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the second most common structural OA disorder affecting approximately 22.9% of individuals 40 years and over globally. The only currently available effective treatment is total knee joint replacement, whichis performed at the late stages of the disease. The lack of effectivedisease modifying drugs and preventive tools highlights our incomplete understanding of the fundamental biological aspects of osteoarthritis. Materials and methods: We performed label free shotgun LC MS in primary chondrocytes obtained from the articular cartilage of 10 OA and 6 healthy individuals. We implemented the statisticalconcepts of Weighted Gene Co expression Network Analysis toreconstruct in an unbiased way the organisation of thechondrocyte proteome and to parse the shared chondrocyte protein interactome in disease associated modules. Results: Chondrocyte proteome is parsed into functional modules with well characterized signi ï¬cance to the disease, such as core structural components of the cartilage ECM which form a meta module with proteins mediating glycolysis. Meta module protein abundance is reduced whilst proteins mediating focal adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics are increased in OA. COL11A1 and TNC have signiï¬cant associations with OA in the GWAS catalog and are members of the ECM module indicating that variants could be exerting a detrimental effect in the context of ECM mechanosensing based regulation of chondrocyte metabolism. Conclusions: Our systems analysis recapitulates hallmarks of OA and offers new insights into the modular structure of the protein interactome that is associated with OA chondrocyte biology.

Introduction: GNAS , located on 20q13.2, is a highly complex imprinted locus from which at least four transcripts (NESP55, GNAS, XL GNAS and A/B) are generated and, some of them, in an allele speci ï¬c way. It is well known that heterozygous GNAS alterations in either allele are associated with growth impairment, pre and postnatally. But less is known about the effect of genetic alterations at XL Î±s(eXtra Large Gs Î±), encoded by and alternative exon 1 of the paternally expressed long form of GsÎ±. Patients and Methods: Three independent families in which the probands (P) were referred for short stature (SS) (P1) and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) or PTH related proteinsignalling disorder type 2 (iPPSD2) (P2,P3) were studied by NGS custom panels. Variant con ï¬rmation and cosegregation studies were carried out via Sanger sequencing. Parental origin of the allele was tested by allele speci ï¬c RT PCR ampli ï¬cation, and sequencing. Results: Three different heterozygous variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS) were identi ï¬ed in the XLÎ±sexon (Table 1). Familial studies suggested cosegregation when the variant waspresent on the paternal allele. Conclusion: We describe the ï¬rst three families in whom XLÎ±ss p e c i ï¬c exon variants on the paternal allele seem to be associated with short stature an d brachydactyly (BD).

Other mutations in NBAS gene have been reported to cause multisystemic disorders with a wide range of phenotypes including recurrent acute liver failure, skeletal dysplasia, eyes pathologies and immunological abnorm alities. Although SOPH patients developed a frequent respiratoryinfection, immunological parameters were not examined.Abstracts from the 54thEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference 224 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:88 â 608Materials and Methods: Sampling was carried out from unrelated Yakut patients with SOPH syndrome and healthy individuals. The percent and number of immunocompetent cells were determined by ï¬ow cytometry. Immunoglobulin serum levels were determined using ELISA kits. In experiments, we usedthe equipment of NEFU âs Center for Collective Use. Results: Serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE) were signi ï¬cantly reduced in SOPH patients in comparison with controls, CD4+and CD8+T cells amounts were unremarkable. Patients with SOPH syndrome were characterized by low percentage and number of CD16+CD56+NK cells and slightly lower levels of CD19+B cells. Conclusions: We suggest that impaired immunological features contribute to recurrent infections in SOPH patients. We would like to emphasize that physicians should pay attention to immuno deï¬ciency in SOPH patients to start appropriate treatment.

AS is caused by the loss of expression of the maternal copy of theUBE3A gene in 15q11.2 q13 imprinted region. Many genetic mechanisms are involved, of which the most frequent was the deletion of the maternally inherited 15q11.2 q13 region. Materials and Methods: Clinical and genetic analyses of a cohort of 44 patients, referred to our Department of Congenital and Hereditary Diseases from 2004 to 2020. MS PCR was performed for diagnostic con ï¬rmation while FISH, microsatellites study and UBE3A gene sequencing were realized to genetic mechanism determination. Results: We noted one familial form with 6/44 affected cases and 38/44 sporadic ones. The sex ratio was 1,44. The averageage at the ï¬rst presentation was 4 years and at the diagnosis conï¬rmation was 4.5 years. All patients had developmental delay, severe speech impairment and characteristic behavior.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorders or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorders (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorders without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

SPATA5 protein localizes predo minantly in the mitochondria and is proposed to be involved in mitochondrial remodeling, ATP production and brain development. Materials and Methods: A boy aged 11 years (Patient 1) was born the ï¬rst child to non consanguineous parents at term. He was referred to genetic evaluation because of the mental retardation, hypotonia and autistic features. Patient 2 was a 1 year old girl and the younger sister of Patient 1.She was referred to genetic evaluation because of the developmental delay and low muscle tone. Metabolic and mitochondrial DNA testing resultswere normal in both patients. In an attempt to establish thediagnosis Whole exome sequencing was carried out. Results: Both patients underwent Whole Exome Sequencing. The two siblings carried compound heterozygous mutations in theSPATA5 gene: c.554G>A(p.Gly185Glu) and c.1831C>T(p.Pro611 Ser). The variants were con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing.

Introduction: Kabuki Makeup Syndrome (KMS) OMIM 147920 is a rare genetic disease characterized by phenotypic traits, mental retardation, and autistic symptoms. KMS is caused by pathogenicmutations in the genes KMT2D, KDM6A. Mutation of the KMT2Dgene is inherited by autosomal dominant type; mutation of the KDM6A gene is inherited X linked dominantly. Materials and Methods: A clinical case of KMS in a 2 year old girl. Syndromological, ""Face2gene"", cytogenetic, moleculargenetic, instrumental methods of examination were used. Results: Girl from the third planned pregnancy; which was on the background of the threat of miscarriage, polyhydramnios,hypothyroidism. The baby was born at 36 weeks of pregnancy weighing 2930 g, length 49 cm, on the Apgar scale 8/8 points. Phenotype: cleft palate, protruding ear shells, arched eyebrows,long oblique eye slits, blue sclera, epicanthus, ectropion of thelower eyelids, wide tip of the nose, hypoplasia of the nails on the V ï¬ngers of the wrists of the hands, congenital, muscular hypotension, delay of stato kinetic development. Syndromologicaldiagnostics was performed using the diagnostic program ""Face2 gene""; suspected KMS; cytogenetic, molecular genetic research is recommended to verify the diagnosis. Karyotype of a child 46,XX. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic mutation(c.11884C>T) (p.Gln3962 ) in the KMT2D gene, which is associated with an autosomal dominant type of KMS (MedGen UID: 893727). Conclusions: Diagnosis of KMS is possible by speci ï¬c pheno typic characteristics. Veri ï¬cation of the diagnosis is based on the results of molecular genetic analysis.

The main features of patients with an 8q21.11 deletion encompassing this gene are intellectualdisability, hypotonia, short stature, and a peculiar facial pheno type. Corneal opacity has been frequently reported and some of the subjects also show a wide range of severe eye abnormalities. Case report: We describe a female patient with mild intellectualdisability and autism spectrum disorder. She had brachycephaly with ï¬at occiput, wide forehead, strabismus, monolateral ptosis, epicanthic folds, low set, prominent, posteriorly rotated ears, longand smooth philtrum, thin lips, high arched palate, microretrog nathia, short 4 thand 5thmetacarpal bones, lumbar hyperlordosis. Clinical Exome Sequencing revealed the presence of the hetero zygous de novo pathogenic variant c.3093 +1G>T in the ZFHX4 gene. This variant is located in a canonical donor splice site,suggesting a possible alteration of the splicing process and a loss of protein function. Conclusions: Severe eye abnormalities occur with a high frequency in patients with large 8q21.11 deletions. They range from Peters anomaly to cataract, microphthalmia, sclerocornea, corneal opacity, pigmentary retina degeneration. None of theseabnormalities have been reported in patients with ZFHX4 point mutations, intragenic deletions, or small deletions encompassing only ZFHX4 . We propose that ZFHX4 loss of function is associated with an autosomal dominant condition, characterized by aneurobehavioural phenotype and a recognizable pattern of facialfeatures.

Material and Methods: Mutant variant allele frequencies (VAFs) in plasma were measured by BRAF p.V600E and KRAS p.G12/p.G13 ddPCR assays in 22 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, from whomclinical data were available. Results: Analytical validation of BRAF p.V600E and KRAS p.G12/ p.G13 assays revealed a cutoff for residual disease detection of0.02% and 0.11% VAF and accurate quanti ï¬cation for â¥0.52% and â¥0.41% VAF in plasma, respectively.

Two splicing prediction algorithms were used.Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the expression of GNAS . Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using a gene speci ï¬c primer was realized in order to identify the mutant allele. Results: We identi ï¬ed a synonymous GNAS variant NM_001077488.2:c.108C>A / p.(Val36 ,) present in the affected members with IPPSD2 phenotype. In silico splicing prediction algorithms were in favor of a deleterious effect of this variant, bycreating a new donor splicing site. The GNAS expression studies in blood suggested haploinsuf ï¬ciency and showed an alternate splice product demonstrating the unmasking of a cryptic site,leading to a 34 base pairs deletion and possibly, the creation of an unstable RNA. Conclusions: We present the ï¬rst familial case of IPPSD2 caused by a pathogenic synonymou s predicted variant in GNAS gene. This observation supports the increasing interest in the identi ï¬cation of splicing variants, particularly tho se predicted as synonymous, which are often systematically categori zed as benign.

Non coding variants have emerged as important contributors to the pathogenesis of human diseases, not only as common susceptibilityalleles but also as rare high impact variants. Despite recent advances in the study of regulatory elements and the availability of specialized data collections, the systematic annotation of non coding variants from genome sequencing remains challenging. Here we present a framework for the annotation and prioritization of regulatory variants in WGS/GWAS analysis to support thediscovery of candidate disease associated variants in the non coding genome. First, we integrated 24 data sources to develop a standardized collection of 2.4 million regulatory elements in the human genome, transcription factor binding sites, DNase peaks,ultra conserved non coding elements, and super enhancers. Infor mation on controlled gene(s), tissue(s) and associated phenotype(s) are provided for regulatory elements when possible. Then, we calculated a variation constraint metric for regulatory regions andshowed that genes controlled by constrained regions are more likely to be disease associated genes and essential genes. Finally, we evaluated 16 non coding impact prediction scores providingsuggestions for variant prioritization. The proposed annotationframework was able to capture previously published disease associated non coding variants and its integration in a routine prioritization pipeline increased the number of candidate genes,including genes potentially correlated with patient phenotype, andestablished clinically relevant genes.

We postulated that longitudinal changes in microRNAs could be a signature of psychotic transition. Material and methods: Next generation high throughput sequencing of microRNAs was done at two time points in 81 at risk subjects (of whom 35 transited). MicroRNA variation across time ( Îmirna) was computed as the difference between baseline and follow up microRNA measures, divided by the subject âs follow up time. Three methods were combined to ï¬ndÎmirna associated with psychosis: 1) a differential expression analysis of Îmirna after stringently ï¬ltering microRNAs sequenced in all samples at all times (77 among 2479 detected in total); 2) asupervised algorithm with a ridge classi ï¬er applied to all 2479 Îmirna to identify the variations in expression most relevant for prediction; 3) a differential network analysis applied to all Îmirna to identify interactions speci ï¬c to converters or non converters. Results: miR 150 5p variation across time differed signi ï¬cantly between groups, after FWER correction. The machine learning strategy predicted psychosis with an area under the curve of 66 %(non parametric p ,0.009), and 207 Îmirna were con ï¬dently leveraged for prediction, with bootstrapped 95% con ï¬dence intervals excluding zero. There were 276 Îmirna with interactions speci ï¬c to either converters or non converters. Discussion: Combining three different strategies, we reduced the risk of methodological biases associated with any single method. Crossing machine learning and network analyses, we identi ï¬ed 25 microRNAs. Their 438 gene targets were enriched in schizophrenia GWAS genes and synaptic processes.

Identifying sample mix ups in biobanks is essential to allow the repurposing of genetic data for clinical pharmacogenetics. Pharmacogenetic advice based on the genetic information of another individual is potentially harmful. Existing methods foridentifying mix ups are limited to datasets in which additionalomics data (e.g. gene expression) is available. Cohorts lacking such data can only use sex, which can reveal only half of the mix ups. Here, we describe IdÃ© ï¬x, a method for the identi ï¬cation of accidental sample mix ups in biobanks using polygenic scores. In the Lifelines biobank we calculated polygenic scores (PGSs) for 25 traits for 32,786 population based participants. IdÃ© ï¬x then compares the actual phenotypes to PGSs and uses the relativediscordance that is expected for mix ups, compared to correct samples. In a simulation, using induced mix ups, IdÃ© ï¬x reaches an AUC of 0.90 using 25 polygenic scores and sex. This is a substantialimprovement over using only sex, which has an AUC of 0.75. IdÃ© ï¬x therefore is not yet able to identify every sample mix up. However, this will likely improve soon, with highly powered GWAS summarystatistics that will likely become available for more commonlymeasured traits. Nevertheless, IdÃ© ï¬x can already be used to identify a high quality set of participants for whom it is very unlikely that theyreï¬ect sample mix ups, and therefore could be offered a pharmacogenetic passport. For instance, when selecting the 10% of participants for whom predicted phenotypes adhere bestto the actually measured phenotypes, we estimate that theproportion of sample mix ups is reduced 250 fold.",2021.0,,R.

After migration, the secondgroup had been subjected to ârelative hyperoxia âbecause of environmental shift. We studied various hematological and epigenetic signatures of these two groups. Additionally, wesearched for loci that are under natural selection. Hematological parameters of 89 low and 79 high altitude Tibetans were evaluated by automated hematology analyzer and manual methods. Serumerythropoietin was measured by ELISA.

Here we present the ï¬rst study in the Cypriot population with respect to different RASopathies. NF1 is excluded from this study since anexclusive study of this gene in the Cypriot population has been previously performed. 43 patients with suspected or con ï¬rmed clinical diagnosis of RASopathies, were screened with NGS andMLPA in an attempt to elucidate the underlying genetic etiologyof their condition. Of these, 60% had a clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome, whereas 12% had a clinical diagnosis of either Costello, NF2, Swannomatosis, Legius or cardio facio cutaneoussyndromes.

Despite decades of research, problems discerning cause and effect have impeded our under standing of its pathophysiology. Materials and Methods: Using GWASs we explored genetic correlations of the ï¬ve aforementioned traits and 1218 additional GWAS traits using LD score based genetic correlations. This was done to examine if the current de ï¬nition was meaningful and to identify traits that could be substituted or added to the syndrome. We further used MAGMA to identify genetic loci, pathways, mouse/human phenotypes, drugs, tissues, and cells that werebroadly associated with the syndrome or were uniquely associatedwith the different components of the syndrome. Results: The metabolic syndrome traits were more correlated than traits in general ( P,3.9E 6). Several, often unexpected traits, signi ï¬cantly correlated with all components of the syndrome (n , 314). These included osteoarthritis, smoking, drinking, attention deï¬cit hyperactivity disorder, and various metabolites. At the gene level, genes associated with lipid/glucose metabolism, andadipocyte function showed associations across all aspects of themetabolic syndrome. Genes uniquely associated with a single trait of the syndrome were often well known from physiology and/or monogenic disease. Further analyses dissected the ï¬ve constitu ent traits into different disease components. E.g. abdominal obesity had, in addition to the lipid/glucose component, also brain/behavioral component. Conclusions: Jointly, this data driven approach suggested endophenotypes and implicated both lipid/glucose metabolismand behavior in the syndrome as well as highlighting a genetic overlap with related monogenic traits and drug targets.",2021.0,,M.E.

Introduction: Sepsis is a severe systemic in ï¬ammatory response to infections that has a 20 30% mortality rate. To date, most genetic studies have focused on particular biological candidates. Weperformed the ï¬rst genome wide association study (GWAS) of 28 day survival in sepsis. Methods . A GWAS was performed in 475 Europeans from the GEN SEP cohort and 7.5 million imputed variants. Associationanalyses were conducted using Cox regression models, adjusting by gender, age, and the main two principal components of genetic variation. A replication was performed in 212 independentpatients from the same cohort. Statistical signi ï¬cance was established at p< 5.0E 8 in the meta analysis. Whole blood transcriptomics from septic patients were assessed by focusing on genes linked to signi ï¬cant variants. Results and conclusions . The GWAS identi ï¬ed three indepen dent common variants associated with reduced 28 day survival, including an exonic variant in SAMD9 (HR,4.75, 95%CI ,2.86 7.89, p,1.77E 9), which encodes the sterile alpha motif domain containing protein 9, related with the in ï¬ammatory response to tissue injury. An upregulation of SAMD9 expression in non surviving septic patients ( p,0.003) was observed. In conclusion, we completed the ï¬rst GWAS of 28 day survival in sepsis and identi ï¬ed novel candidate genes associated with reduced survival.

Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a high ly prevalent musculoske letal disorder and a leading caus e of disability among older adults. Varicose veins (VVs) are a common venous pathology affecting over one third of adults worldwide. There is increasing evidence of the link between VVs of lower extremities and knee OA, but it is unclear ifthere are causal relationships between the disorders. Materials and Methods: We performed a two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using two pairs of publicly available genome wide association study ( GWAS) summary statistics for Europeans from UK Biobank (Gene ATLAS, N ,452,264) and FinnGen (N,176,899). Each trait pair in cluded non overlapping GWAS datasets on âVVs of lower extremities â(I83 ICD 10 code) and âGonarthrosis â(M17 ICD 10 code) gained from different biobanks. The MR was conducted using inverse variance weighted meta analysis and Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE) approach. All the tests were run in two directions. Results: No statistically signi ï¬cant results were obtained and no concordance between the MR effect estimates (magnitude and direction) was observed. Conclusions: We provided no support for causal relationships between VVs of lower extremities and knee OA. Conversely, evenif the causality exists, its magnitude is not clinically signi ï¬cant since it has not been detected using such large datasets.",2021.0,,A.S. Shadrina: None. E.E. Elgaeva: None. M.B.

Recent studies highlight the existence of regulatory domains (e.g. groups ofenhancers) orchestrating the organised expression of nearby genes (Delaneau et al. 2019 Science 364(6439)). Yet, the prevalence and genetic control of local gene co expression arefar from being understood. By leveraging gene expressionmeasurements across 49 human tissues and hundreds of individuals, we found local gene co expression to be highly prevalent, occurring in 13% to 53% genes per tissue. Notably, weidenti ï¬ed >30.000 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) which associate with co expressed gene pairs and often overlap enhancer regions. Due to affecting several genes, these eQTLsare more often associated with multiple human traits than eQTLsassociated with only one gene. Next, to understand how the observed local gene co expression and its regulation manifests at the single cell level, we analysed a dataset of single cell RNA seqacross 60 genotyped individuals in a homogeneous cell type(iPSC). By taking advantage of co expression measurements for >50 cells per individual, we identi ï¬ed 100 550 locally co expressed gene pairs per individual. Interestingly, while many co expressedgene pairs are speci ï¬c to certain individuals, we discovered that those present across >50% of the individuals often participate in the same biological pathway (OR ,16.5, P value ,1e 9). Finally, in a bid to comprehend disease comorbidity and providefunctional interpretation of QTL and GWAS ï¬ndings, we identify eQTLs affecting co expressed gene pairs in individuals suffering from various disease comorbidities in the UK Biobank.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes.

3674,11," Leveraging public epigenomic datasets to examine the role of regulatory variation in complex traits Sushmita Roy University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, USA",S01.2,," Many variants identi ï¬ed by genome wide association studies (GWAS) occur in non coding sequences. Understanding theimpact of such variants on complex phenotypes is a signi ï¬cant challenge. This is because such regulatory variants can affect the expression of gene hundreds of kilobases away, and the targetgenes themselves are part of a larger unknown biological pathway. High throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technologies that measure the three dimensional proximityof genomic loci at high resolution (e.g. 5kb) can be used to linkgenes to regulatory variants over long distances, but they exist only for a handful of model cell lines due to high sequencing costs. We have developed a computational framework forpredicting such data, comprising (1) a Random Forest basedregression model to predict in silico contact counts of pairs of genomic loci, and (2) a multi task subnetwork identi ï¬cation approach to identify potential pathways targeted by a set ofvariants from a GWAS study. Our count prediction approach takes as input one dimensional signals such as histone modi ï¬cations, chromatin accessibility and accessible sequence motifs ofarchitectural proteins such as CTCF and predicts the contactcount for pairs of regions. We trained our approach on ï¬ve high resolution Hi C datasets and applied the trained models to 55 human cell lines and tissues from the Roadmap Epigenomics6 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 â 87project using both measured and imputed features. Our predic tions, when aggregated to a lower resolution (e.g. 40kb), accurately recapitulate the measured low resolution contact count, as well as identify larger units of 3D chromosomeorganization. Signi ï¬cant interactions from our predicted counts are associated with increased gene expression and enriched for interactions from ChIA PET experiments. We used our compen dium of signi ï¬cant interactions to predict target genes of regulatory SNPs associated with traits from the NHGRI GWAScatalog. We applied our multi task graph clustering approach to identify subsets of cell types associated with a phenotype of interest, e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia.We found that the subnetworks are enriched for processes thatare relevant to the phenotype of interest (e.g. SNPs associated with ASD and schizophrenia are enriched for cognition, associative and visual learning and regulation of nerve impulse in fetal brainand fetal spinal cord tissue).

Introduction: Williams Syndrome (WS) is caused by a 1.5 1.8 MB deletion on 7q11.23. About 15 20% of people with WS havesevere supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) requiring surgicalintervention. In contrast, ~40% with WS have no SVAS. Little is known about the genetic features impacting SVAS severity. Conventional statistical approaches for modi ï¬er evaluation would require thousands of cases, making it infeasible for the study ofrare diseases. Here we propose an alternative approach to identify disease modi ï¬ers in smaller cohorts. Methods: We sequenced 450 geno mes from individuals w i t hW S ,i n c l u d i n gt h o s ew i t hs e v e r e( n,75) and no ( n,186) SVAS. Variants were jointly called using GATK procedures, identifying ~132,000 non syno nymous variants. CADD phred scores were used to ï¬lter out variants with little potential pathogenicity as well as those with minimal frequency difference between severity groups. Geneset enrichment,followed by burden testing of candidate pathway was then performed. Results: We identi ï¬ed 901 genes with 1032 non synonymous variants with a difference in allele frequency between severe SVASand no SVAS > 5% and CADD phred scores > 10. Among the topcanonical pathways enriched, we identi ï¬ed the extracellular matrix (FDR q,7.19 x 10 â15, with particular enrichment of collagens and glycoproteins), and cell matrix interactions (FDR q ,4.58 x 10â5). Genes related to G protein coupled receptor signaling (FDR q,9.02 x 10â11) and those implicated in the response to viral infection (FDR q,1.39 x 10â5) are also notable.

Cognitive resilience is the ability to withstand the negative effects of stress on cognitive functioning and is important for maintaining quality of life while aging. UK Biobank (UKB) does not have directmeasurements of cognitive ability at distal timepoints. Therefore,we used number of years in education (EY) as a proxy phenotype for past cognitive performance. Current cognitive performance was determined based on processing speed. This approachcaptured an average time span of 40 years between past and current cognitive performance in 330,097 individuals. A confound ing factor was that EY is highly polygenic and masked the geneticsof resilience. To overcome this, we employed Genomics StructuralEquation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to perform a GWAS by subtraction using two GWAS, one GWAS of EY and resilience and a second GWAS of EY but not resilience. Subtracting one fromthe other generated a GWAS of resilience. Replication of thisapproach was shown using independent discovery and replication samples and the full GWAS results were examined further using functional genomics analysis. We found 13 independent geneticloci for resilience. Functional analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of speci ï¬c cell types, including GABAergic neurons ( P,6.59x10 â8) and glutamatergic neurons ( P,6.98x10â6) in the cortex.

The employment ofcomplementary research approaches may be useful to identify additional genes implicated in GD pathogenesis. Here we combined for the ï¬rst time in the ï¬eld the transcriptomic analysis of GnRH neurons with exome sequencing data from GD patientsto identify novel candidate genes. As a proof of principle, we identi ï¬ed a pathogenic variant in the autism linked Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3 ) gene in a patient with severe delayed puberty and autistic traits. We demonstrated that NLGN3 is enriched in GnRH neurons at late developmental stages. Further we found that NLGN3 overexpression in an immature model of immortalizedGnRH neurons promoted neurite extension whereas the novelNLGN3 mutation formed a truncated protein, thus supporting its pathogenic potential. Overall, our results highlighted how the combination of gene expression and exome sequencing data is areliable approach to identify novel candidate gene for GD such aNLGN3, an autism linked gene that we found for the ï¬rst time associated to GD.",2021.0,,R.

Introduction: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non atherosclerotic arteriopathy of unknown etiology, affecting mostly middle aged women. It is characterized by stenotic lesions of thevascular wall in middle size arteries, sometimes associated with dissection, aneurysm or tortuosity. Methods: We report results from the ï¬rst genome wide association meta analysis of six studies including 1962 FMD casesand 7100 controls. We integrated genetic association with arterial gene expression using transcriptome wide association (TWAS). To identify FMD associated variants located in regulatory elements,we determined open chromatin regions in artery derived primarycells using ATAC Seq and estimated heritability and genetic correlation of FMD with other vascular traits and diseases using LD Score regression. Results: We found an estimate of SNP based heritability compatible with a polygenic feature for FMD and report four robustly associated loci ( PHACTR1 ,LRP1 ,ATP2B1 , and LIMA1 ). TWAS identi ï¬ed one additional locus ( SLC24A3 ). We found that FMD associated variants were located in arterial speci ï¬c regulatory elements. Target genes were broadly involved in mechanisms related to actin cytoskeleton and intracellular calcium home ostasis, central to vascular contraction. We found signi ï¬cant genetic overlap between FMD and hypertension, one of the most frequent consequences of FMD lesions. We also report an important genetic overlap with migraine, intracranial aneurysm,coronary artery disease and LDL cholesterol. Conclusion: We identi ï¬ed several loci related to vascular contraction, suggesting that altered vascular tonicity may play a role in the pathogenesis of FMD. We ï¬nd that FMD is genetically close to several vascular diseases where vascular integrity is impaired. This work was funded by ERC grant ERC Stg ROSALIND 716628.",2021.0,,A. Georges: None. M.

To investigate the interplay between molecular intermediaries that de ï¬ne the pathways from genetic variation to disease, we evaluated the shared genetic regulation of mRNA molecules,proteins and metabolites derived from whole blood from 3,029 human donors. We observed extensive allelic heterogeneity, with 94.4% genes, 97.3% proteins and 49.2% metabolites associatedwith two or more variants, and pleiotropy, where variants wereassociated with multiple local (cis) and distal (trans) molecular phenotypes. Estimates of the proportion of shared genetic regulation ranged from 66.6% for expression and proteins,33.3% for expression and metabolites, to 27% for proteins andmetabolites. Compared to gene expression in a diverse set of 44 tissues, the highest proportion of sharing of genetic regulation was observed for gene expression (from 81% in testis to 98% inbrain); followed by plasma proteins (from 20.5% spleen to 100% inliver or skeletal muscle) and plasma metabolites (from 0% brain to 16.88% testis).
