5,443,Preliminary Findings In The Diagnostic Evaluation Of A Sample Of 103 Individuals With Pervasive DevelopmentDisorders,P0341., E. Steiner   M. M. Guerreiro  A. P. Marques de Faria Unicamp  Campinas  B,Pervasive development disorders (PDD) are a heterogeneous group ofneurobehavioral disorders of infancy. In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD  a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation  screening for inborn errors of metabolism  karyotypein folic acid deficient medium  and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation.Until now  the following conditions were detected  Down syndrome (n = 3) untreated phenylketonuria (n = 2)  Rett syndrome (n = 2)  tuberous sclero sis (n = 1)  fragile X syndrome (n = 1)  5 other dysmorphic conditions  2non genetic etiologies  and 2 individuals with chromosomal polymor phisms. Besides those  4 individuals presented no PDD and 3 individualshad infantile psychosis. These data suggest that  in at least 15% of thissample  a main etiologic factor could be identified. Although the diagnosisof a specific genetic condition do not modify the treatment of autistic indi viduals in most cases  it is of significant importance to the genetic coun seling of their relatives. For this reason  we reinforce the importance ofcareful dysmorphologic examination and complementary tests in any per son presenting with PDD  besides neurologic and psychiatric evaluation. ,2001.0,dgmfcm@unicamp.br,,,In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD  a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation  screening for inborn errors of metabolism  karyotypein folic acid deficient medium  and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation.Until now  the following conditions were detected  Down syndrome (n = 3) untreated phenylketonuria (n = 2)  Rett syndrome (n = 2)  tuberous sclero sis (n = 1)  fragile X syndrome (n = 1)  5 other dysmorphic conditions  2non genetic etiologies  and 2 individuals with chromosomal polymor phisms.,,autistic behavior,[],"['autistic', 'behavior']"

Brondum NielsenJohn F. Kennedy Institute  Glostrup  D,The subtelomeric regions are often involved in chromosomal rearrange 172 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyments. They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients  all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism  andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found  A 1pter deletion  resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR  growth retardation  and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR  epilepsy microcephaly  and dysmorphism  consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR  microcephaly  an atrial septum defect  and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients.In conclusion three out of 41 (7.3%) patients with idiopathic MR were foundto have subtelomeric rearrangements  in concordance with the prevalence(5 10%) in previous studies. ,2001.0,els@kennedy.dk,,,Two groups of patients  all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism  andwith at least one other relative affected with autism.,patients with autism,,"['patient', 'with', 'autism']",[]

This is due to an abnormalexpanded GCC repeat  adjacent to a methylated CpG island proximal tothe FMR2 gene. As part of a routine diagnosis  all individuals referred to usfor Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) study  and tested FRAXA negative  werestudied for FRAXE mutation. Among 485 index case patients  2 were iden tified with the FRAXE full mutation  both with cytogenetic expression of thefragile site (29 and 23% respectively) and with no history of mental retar dation. One of them has an autistic disorder with severe MR an a dysmor phic face similar to FXS. The second one is a nearly normal man with nor mal phenotype but who had learning difficulties at school when he was achild. Their families were also studied  with a total of 16 members at risktested. We found 6 of them normal (3 men and 3 women) and 10 carrierwomen (4 premutated and 6 fully mutated). None of these women presentany type of mental impairment. The last sample studied was a fully mutat ed female foetus that was spontaneously aborted after obtaining chorionicvilli for prenatal diagnosis. Although the GCC expansion was greater than0.8 kb  it was unmethylated in the majority of the tissues studied by us. So even though molecular study of FRAXE mutation is now available  furtherstudies are nedeed for the purpose of genetic counselling and prenataldiagnosis. ,2001.0,itejada@hbas.osakidetza.net,,,One of them has an autistic disorder with severe MR an a dysmor phic face similar to FXS.,,autistic disorder,[],"['autistic', 'disorder']"

Yaron1 1Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center  Tel Aviv  Israel  2Sheba Medical Cen  ter  Ramat Gan  Israel  3UCLA School of Medicine  Los Angeles  CA Unit  ed States  4Meir General Hospital  Kfar Saba  Israel ,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized bycognitive and adaptive regression with autistic features  loss of acquiredskills like speech and hand usage  stereotypic hand movements  epilepsy ataxia and deceleration of head growth that almost exclusively affectsfemales. Even before the causative gene for this syndrome was identified  pedigree studies indicated that it was likely to be an X linked dominantdisorder  with presumed lethality in males. Nonetheless  there were a fewdescriptions of males suspected of having Rett syndrome. These includesporadic cases meeting the clinical inclusion criteria  sporadic males withKlinefelter syndrome (47 XXY)  and males with severe neonatalencephalopathy in known Rett syndrome families. With the recent discov ery that the MECP2 gene on Xq28 is the gene responsible for most casesof Rett syndrome  it is possible to molecularly assess cases suspected ofhaving male Rett syndrome by direct sequencing analysis. We describethe first 4 cases of molecularly confirmed cases of Rett syndrome in Israel.One of the families presented here consists of a female having classicalRett syndrome and a male sibling with severe neonatal encephalopathy.Molecular analysis revealed that both sister and brother have the sameMECP2 gene mutation  however their mother does not  suggestinggermline mosaicism. The case emphasizes the point that maternalgermline mosaicism may lead to affected female or male offspring  whichshould be taken into consideration during genetic counseling regardingrecurrence risks  and suggests that prenatal diagnosis may be warrantedin siblings of apparently sporadic cases of Rett syndrome. It also highlightsthe importance of molecular diagnosis in every case of idiopathic neonatalencephalopathy in males. ,2001.0,aviorr@tasmc.health.gov.il,,,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized bycognitive and adaptive regression with autistic features  loss of acquiredskills like speech and hand usage  stereotypic hand movements  epilepsy ataxia and deceleration of head growth that almost exclusively affectsfemales.,,autistic features,[],"['autistic', 'feature']"

Clas sical RS features seem to occur almost exclusively in females  with an esti mated prevalence of one in 10 000 15 000 female birth. The vast majori ties of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin  and are due to de novomutations. Mutations in the Methyl CpG Binding protein 2 gene have been identified in roughly 75 % of classical Rett girls. We collected DNA samplesfrom 42 Italian classical Rett girls  and screened the MECP2 coding regionfor mutations by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography(DHPLC)  and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently devel oped method for mutation screening combining high sensitivity  reducedcost per run and high throughput. In our study  16 different de novoMECP2 mutations  seven of which were previously unreported  were foundin 32/42 Rett girls (76%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized ina total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identifi cation of 14/16 different mutations (87%)  after optimal conditions wereestablished  this figure increased to 100%  with all recurrent MECP2 muta tions generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Standardizationof DHPLC reagents and methods seems to be critical to the reliability andaccuracy of mutation prediction. Detailed analysis of signature shape retention time  and retention time differences between peaks will allow sig nature based sequence identification  at least for the most commonMECP2 mutations and SNPs. ,2001.0,talycarella@tigem.it,,,Rett Syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disordercharacterized by several clinical abnormalities  such as progressiveencephalopathy  autistic behavior and stereotyped hand movements.,,autistic behavior,[],"['autistic', 'behavior']"

We report a girl withautistic features carrying a balanced translocation t(5 7)(q14 q34). Fluo rescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis with chromosome 7q specificYAC clones showed that the chromosome 7 breakpoint is located betweenmarkers D7S684 and D7S661. The region coincides with the candidateregion for autism on chromosome 7 from previous linkage studies. A BACclone of 82 kb spanning the translocation breakpoint was identified  andthe breakpoint was mapped to 2 kb region within the BAC. Mutationscreening of the 2 genes closest to the breakpoint was performed in a setof 30 autistic patients. We found no sequence variant which predictsaminoacid alteration associated with the phenotype. Two polymorphicnucleotides were identified in one of the genes  and the significance of thepolymorphism in autism remains to be clarified. Study of the methylationpattern of the breakpoint region failed to find any difference betweenpatient with the translocation and normal individuals.

Poustka Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum  Molecular Genome Analysis  Heidel berg  G,Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic componentas shown in family studies. The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line. In order to determine the exact localizationand orientation of the duplication FISH experiments using several YACswere performed. ,2001.0,ermanyk.beyer@dkfz.de,,,One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients.,,autistic patients,[],"['autistic', 'patient']"

37,23,The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families. Four regions of linkage were identifi ed  including chromosome 2q (MLS 3.74), 7q (MLS 3.20), 16p (MLS  2.93) and 17q (MLS 2.34), three of which have been replicated by  other groups. Candidate gene and association studies are now in  progress in order to isolate the susceptibility genes at these loci.  On chromosome 7q31, the FOXP2 gene is mutated in a severe  monogenic form of speech and language impairment and encodes a  transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead  domain. FOXP2 was tested for association and mutation in both  complex language impairments and autism.

These results confirm that the  vast majority of mutations in the MECP2 gene lead to a classical Rett  syndrome phenotype. They also show that a large proportion of girls  with a severe mental handicap are not found to be associated with a  MECP2 mutation on the contrary to what was recently proposed in  the litterature. In addition, we did not find any genotype phenotype correlations for  the Rett syndrome patients taking into account the mutation type, the  functional domain affected by the mutation and the X chromosome  inactivation status of these patients except for the mutation involving  the C terminal domain associated with a ÃÂ« forme frustre ÃÂ» of the  disease.

There have been occasional reports of hyperphosphatasia associated with progressive postnatal neurodevelopmental disease and seizures (MIM#239300). Affected children exhibit consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) of uncertain origin. There are no other laboratory Ã¯Â¬Ândings of note and no evidence of any abnormality of bone or liver metabolism, or altered skeletal architecture. Affected siblings and/or consanguinity suggest autosomal recessive inheritance, but the underlying pathogenesis is  unknown.We describe a new case and review the clinical features in the context of 16 previously reported children. Our proband is a 5ÃÂ½ yr old girl born to consanguineous parents, who presented with marked developmental delay and dysmorphic features (brachycephaly, coarse facies, hypertelorism, bulbous nose with prominent nasal bridge, and downturned corners of the mouth) at Ã¯Â¬Âve months of age. Subsequently, failure to thrive, acquired microcephaly, and autistic behaviours were observed. Seizures and an abnormal EEG were also seen. The hyperphosphatasia (867ÃÂ±72 IU/L, n=7) is associated with decreased pyridoxal 5Ã¢ÂÂ phosphate (B 6), and the question of aberrant vitamin  B6 metabolism has been raised in this condition before. Pyridoxine  challenge (100 mg bolus) resulted in normalized EEG activity. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs tonic clonic and absence seizures have not been evident since phenobarbital withdrawal and treatment with 100 mg pyridoxine daily.

KBG syndrome is a rare, but underestimated, autosomal dominant disease (40 cases described), characterized by macro oligodontia, short stature, mild to medium mental retardation, skeletal defects and other clinical features. We report 7 sporadic cases, 3 M and 4 F, observed during adolescence.This period is characterized by the modiÃ¯Â¬Âcation of previous relationships, that leads, to a possible change in the role and importance of the family and reference Ã¯Â¬Âgures.The child grows and Ã¢ÂÂthe chrysalis becomes butterÃ¯Â¬ÂyÃ¢ÂÂ. The process seems complicated and difÃ¯Â¬Âcult in KBG patient. He links superÃ¯Â¬Âcially to other persons. His world remains limited to a biunivocal relation with the mother, that lasts longer than the other children, so remaining in a condition of passivity and greatest dependence. He understands he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt overtake the daily problems without help. He reacts isolating from the real life, taking refuge in a fantastic world. He closes himself in a autistic passivity as the only answer to his own inadequacy. The world outside seems to him full of hostility.More than ten years ago we chose, in favour of patients with genetic syndromes, a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a clinical genetist. Therapeutical results have been  satisfactory in KBG patients.We noted: acceptance of their own body, more optimistic approach to life, improvement of school and working integration, higher control of  nutritional and drug addiction.This experience improved our life and our profession, allowing a deep and empathyc interaction between patient and physician, that  represents the true essence of every medical act.",2005.0,,"Biondi , D.

One of the genes associated with CHD is the  NKX2 5 gene, which encodes a  cardiac homeobox transcription factor.

Functional studies of  NKX2  5 mutations have indicated that haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency determines the AV conduction block and ASD phenotypes. However, some studies suggest dominant negative effects and it has not been possible to correlate other  NKX2 5 phenotypes with a speciÃ¯Â¬Âc mechanism of the  mutation due to a small sample size.Here, we present delineation of a microdeletion in a patient with AV conduction block, ASD and tricuspid valve malformation (Ebstein anomaly) in addition to microcephaly, scoliosis and pectoral hypoplasia.

BARCODE (Basic ASD Regression for COmparative Dating Estimates), applies a comparative dating approach free of assumptions on STR mutation rates to detect the linear accumulation of ASD over time. Its power relies on the exploitation of the UEP deÃ¯Â¬Âned phylogeny, which provides a unique solution for the order of nodes in the tree to be analysed. The set of possible solutions to be tested for ASD TIME linearity is created through an algorithm speciÃ¯Â¬Âcally created. The more the phylogeny has a nested shape, the more the dating result is robust. BARCODE allows to weight each lineage according to its frequency in the dataset, a fundamental option Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology348 when the sampled lineages include variants supposed to be ancestral  to a demographic expansion or when dealing with data unbalanced in  sample size.We report the results obtained by running BARCODE on published Y chromosomal data sets. The relative dating estimates are in general agreement with the absolute estimates originally published. The results also allow inferences on STR mutation rates (ASD TIME regression slopes): some critical loci emerged, which show variable mutation patterns across the data sets. However, most STR loci show a similar behaviour across the data sets, thus conÃ¯Â¬Ârming their informativeness.

Moreover, the male:female ratio in multiplex families was 2 .8:1 (37 males:13 females), which appears to be lower than the typical male:female ratio of 4:1 . These data support  our hypothesis that ASD in some families may be caused by autosomal recessive inheritance . Linkage analyses were conducted in multiplex families .

Here, we have attempted to test this hypothesis concern   ing autism, a common childhood psychiatric disorder. About 5 10% of  autism cases are known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities  or gene mutations. However, mosaic aneuploidy in autism has not ever  been studied. We surveyed stochastic aneuploidy in children with/with   out idiopathic autism by interphase multiprobe fluorescence in situ hy   bridization (mFISH). The rate of chromosome loss and gain involving  six arbitrarily selected autosomes (chromosomes 1, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18)  and sex chromosomes was assessed in peripheral blood cells of 60  unaffected male children and 116 male children with idiopathic autism.

However, the frequency  of mosaic aneuploidy over the background level was found in 19 (16%) of 116 children  with idiopathic autism, while outlier values were not found in controls.

148,259,cADHERiN 11 as a possible candidate gene for autism,P01.247,,"Child Psychiatry, Leuven,  Belgium, 3University Center for Child and Youth Psychiatry, Antwerp, Belgium. Background: Positional cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in autism  patients is a valuable strategy towards the identification of candidate  genes, especially in isolated autism, and when the aberration is de novo and family history is negative for autism . (1) Objectives:  We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ  of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods:  1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro   scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON   SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat   ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the  AK13094  gene, another was near GFOD  and RANBP10  . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11   gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11  is expressed in  the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses . (2) Interestingly, there is evidence that  altered synaptogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism .  For instance, the cell adhesion molecules NLGN 3  and  4 are impli   cated in autism through their role in the establishment of functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons . (3) Thus, CHD11  represents  both a positional and functional candidate gene for autism . Mutation  screening in a larger cohort of autism patients is ongoing .

Normal karyotype, and 15q microdeletion was demonstrated in both cases . In the second case, the phenotype was highly suggestive for Angel   man syndrome, while in the first case, a differential diagnosis with Rett  syndrome was considered, especially because of the severe vertebral scoliosis . A diagnosis of Angelman syndrome should be considered in patients  with Rett like phenotype. Molecular investigation of specific genetic  defect allowed, in our cases, the refinement of clinical diagnosis.Financial support: CEEX (Project 150/2006) . Acknowledgements: The authors thank Prof .

In particular, the 15q13.3 microdeletion has been identi   fied in 0.2 0.3% of individuals with mental retardation and epilepsy,  schizophrenia, autism and other neuropsychiatric features. The criti   cal region between BP4 and BP5 contains at least seven genes, in   cluding CHRNA7 , which is considered a good candidate gene for the  epilepsy phenotype. We report a series of 11 patients (8 index cases  and 3 affected parents) presenting a developmental delay and a 1.5  Mb 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion ascertained through 11 French  CGH array platforms. All 8 index cases presented mild to moderate  mental retardation with absent or non specific dysmorphic features.  Only two had seizures, 4 had an abnormal electroencephalogram and  none had an autistic behaviour. One patient presented a highly differ   ent phenotype, including hydrocephaly, joint dislocations, congenital  lymphoedema and notable dysmorphic features associated to men   tal retardation. Familial studies could be performed in 5/8 index pa   tients. Interestingly, all 15q13.3 microdeletions were inherited (3 from  the mother, 2 from the father). The affected parents had mild mental  retardation with epilepsy in one. In particular, the microdeletion was  found in 2 completely asymptomatic mothers. This study is in favour  of incomplete penetrance and more variable clinical expressivity than  previously published. Therefore, the 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion  might be only considered as a risk factor for mental retardation.

Born at term with normal growth parameters, he demonstrated since  the age of 6 months, growth and weight retardation. Delay in motor  milestones was observed as the child did not sit alone at 9 months. He  had also reduced social interactions. G banding showed the presence of a supernumerary chromosome  (47,XY,+mar), composed, as revealed by high resolution aCGH, of  27 Mb from region 9p24.3 to 9p21.2 and 12,3 Mb from 15q11.2 to  15q13.3. This derivative chromosome [der(15)t(9;15)(p21.2;q13.3)]  was subsequently found to derive from a maternal reciprocal trans   location, very likely originating from a meiotic missegregation of 3:1  tertiary type. Partial trisomy 9p21.2 9pter is not well defined but two patients with an  intrachromosomal duplication of chromosome arm 9p [dup(9)(p21p24)]  demonstrated classical clinical manifestations of 9p trisomy with, in  one case, features overlapping with Coffin Siris syndrome. Duplication of the 15q Prader Willi /Angelman syndrome region is  mainly associated with autistic behavior, mental retardation and de   velopmental delay. Most reported cases with associated clinical symp   toms have been linked to extra copies of 15q11 q13 from maternal  origin, paternally derived duplications being generally associated with  a normal phenotype. Our results also support this observation. Presence of potential extra copies of numerous genes from chromo   some 9p in addition to the duplicated 15q region renders a clinical  prognosis difficult.

Most of reported patients have nu   merical chromosomal anomalies, with only few cases having structural  chromosomal anomalies. Here, we report on the clinical and cytoge   netic details of 4 year old female monozygotic twins with discordant  phenotypes. Twin 1 exhibited global developemental delay with walk at 35 months,  absence of speech, and hyperactivity. Twin 2 had an autistic spectrum  disorder without motor delay. Extensive investigations including blood  karyotype, metabolic screening and brain MRI were normal in both  twins. Molecular karyotyping in twin 1 identified a 2p25.3 deletion, further  confirmed by FISH analysis on leukocytes in all cells. Interestingly, ar   ray CGH was normal in twin 2 but FISH analysis performed on leuko   cytes using the same probes showed mosaicism with 33 % of deleted  cells, 33 % of duplicated cells, and 33% of normal cells. Genotyping  confirmed the monozygosity of the twins and ruled out uniparental di  Cytogenetics somy for chromosome 2. We propose that the discordant chromosome  imbalance may be due to a mitotic non allelic recombination occuring  during blastomeric divisions of a normal zygote. Such event will result  in 3 distinct cell populations whose proportion in each embryo formed  after separation from the inner cell mass, may differ, leading to dis   cordant chromosomal anomalies between twins.

These were iden   tified by either array based MLPA or by array CGH/oligonucleotide  analysis in a series of patients with idiopathic mental retardation with  an estimated population frequency of 1:13.000 1:20.000. Interchromo   somal recombination is the preferred exchange mechanism by which  the duplication arises. The CYLN2  gene within the duplicated region  is approximately 2 times overexpressed in carriers of the duplication.  The expression of the GTF2I  gene, just on the boundary of the dupli   cated region and thus with only 2 intact copies present in patients, was  also significantly increased. Variable speech delay is a constant finding in our patient group, con   firming previous reports. Cognitive abilities range from normal to mod   erate mental retardation.

207,11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,,"People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2   gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth  movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects  of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly  conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and  function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak   ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have  been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010.0,,S.

Standard chromosome analysis of amniocytes  revealed apparently the same balanced karyotype in the proband.  However, at the age of three years the boy was referred for genetic  analysis because of psychomotor delay, speech problems, autistic fea   tures, teeth irregularity and dysplastic ears. Array CGH and SNP array  analysis were performed but yielded no clues, including no evidence  for uniparental disomy. ProbandÃ¢ÂÂs elder brother was born prematurely  and died perinatally due to multiple severe malformations including  bilateral cleft lip and palate, protruding premaxilla, right microtia with  the absence of ear canal, deformation of legs, hypospadia and hypo   genitalism. Chromosome analysis showed an unbalanced transloca   tion t(8;10)(q13;q24) which led to partial monosomy of 8q. ProbandÃ¢ÂÂs  unaffected stepbrother has normal karyotype. ProbandÃ¢ÂÂs unaffected  stepsister has karyotype 46,XX,t(8;10)(q13;q24). In her case a recom   bination replaced the deletion in the translocated part of chromosome  8 with a segment of the normal chromosome 8. This, in combination  with chromosome 3 lacking the insertion, led to a balanced karyotype  with a simple reciprocal translocation. All findings were validated using  FISH with chromosome paints.

Their carriers have a high risk of primary infertility, spontane   ous abortions or children with unbalanced karyotypes. We report an  unusual case of a familial CCR involving three chromosomes. An 8 year old girl was referred for chromosome analysis because of  heart defect, dysmorphic facial features, mild mental retardation and  autistic features including a delay of speech development. Karyotyping  revealed derivative chromosomes 20 and 22. For further clarification of  the rearrangement, FISH was performed using 20p and 20q subtelo   meric probes. It showed that material from 20p was translocated onto  22p. Array CGH was essential for the identification of the suspected  third partner in this CCR: It showed a 3q duplication of about 16.5 Mb,  and the CCR thus involved chromosomes 3, 20 and 22. Karyotyping and FISH analysis of other relatives indicated that four  members of this family are carriers of a balanced form of this CCR.  These individuals are asymptomatic. Four of their descendants have  two types of unbalanced CCRs. The proband and her maternal aunt  have partial duplications of chromosome 3.

230,489,t wo girls with mental retardation and behavioural  abnormalities: is the deletion of the A tXN1 gene on 6p22.3 a  major factor in causing the phenotype?,P03.065,,"6p22 interstitial deletions are relatively rare, with only eight patients  described so far. The clinical phenotype in these patients includes  developmental delay/mental retardation, defects of brain, heart and  kidney, craniofacial malformations and dysmorphic features. The com   mon deleted region, 2.2 Mb, harbouring 12 genes, has been defined  as critical for this syndrome. ATXN1 , located within this interval, has  been suggested as a candidate gene for the mental retardation based  on its expression in CNS and the cognitive impairments manifested in  knock out mice. We report on two patients carrying partly overlapping  de novo deletions within 6p22.3, which are smaller than the ones pre   viously reported. Patient 1 displays mild mental retardation and behav   ioural problems; her 115 kb deletion (chr6:16215803 16332297, hg19)  encompasses only GMPR  and ATXN1 . Patient 2 has severe mental  retardation, autistic features and hyperactivity. Her deletion spans 2.3  Mb (chr6:14545576 16846846, hg19) and includes JARID2 , DTNBP1   and MYLIP , in addition to GMPR  and ATXN1 . Because the GMP re   ductases encoded by GMPR and GMPR2  have redundant functions,  haploinsufficiency of GMPR  is not likely causing the cognitive impair   ments in our patients. We therefore suggest that ATXN1 hemizygosity  is sufficient to cause the mental retardation in patient 1. Furthermore,  additional genes such as MYLIP , which is expressed in brain and has  been shown to have a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, is expected  to contribute to the significantly more severe phenotype of patient 2.Cytogenetics11",2010.0,,"T.

Autism is characterized by  difficulties in managing social interaction and communication, and a  limited, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of reactions and behavior.

244,1317,molecular investigation of TBX1  gene in individuals  with Asperger syndrome,P12.013,," Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder from the  Autism Spectrum Disorders. It is characterized by impairments in so   cialization and ritualistic and stereotypic behaviors. Despite of the de   scription of mutations in several genes, the etiology remains unknown.  Genetic and early developmental factors are considered important for  its occurrence. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders are a prominent  part of the 22q11 deletion syndrome. Furthermore, there is a description  of one individual with AS and mutation in TBX1  gene that is mapped in  22q11.2 region. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform  a mutation screening of TBX1  gene in individuals with AS. We ana   lyzed 14 subjects. Mutation screening of TBX1  by direct sequencing  detected several synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),  already reported in NCBI database.

Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.  Most probably this is due to the characteristics of this group, being  clinically mixed and containing some definite autistic cases.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.  Conclusion: The Arg468His mutation is the most prevalent (6/14 fami   lies) mutation in MFN2 causing CMT2A in Spanish patients and our  study confirmed that it is actually pathological, presenting as a neu   ropathy in a mild to moderate degree.",2010.0,,"T.

Speech delay was found in 5/6 patients, with dysarthry in 3/6, mental retardation in 4/6 patients, ASD phenotype in 3/6 patients, mild non specific dysmorphism (3/6) with prominent ear lobes in 2/6 patients, normal growth parameters with macrocephaly in 1/6 patient and microcephaly in 1/6. Variable expressivity or incomplete penetrance was found in both familial cases. The clinical and molecular data of this group of patients were compared to the other observations of the literature. The ELKS/ERC1 gene is found in the commonly deleted  region, and appears as a good candidate for speech delay.These results reinforce the hypothesis that the 12p13.33 subtelomeric or interstitial deletions can be responsible of a variable phenotyope ranging from normal developpement, speech delay, to mental retardation and ASD.",2011.0,,"J.

The inv dup (15) or idic (15) is the most common of the heterogeneous  group of the extra structurally abnormal chromosomes (ESAC). Two cytogenetics types have been identified. One is a metacentric or submetacentric and heterochromatic chromosome, not containing the Prader Willi Syndrome/ Angelman Syndrome Critical Region  (PWS/ASCR) [dic(15)(q11).dic(15)(q11)], can be familial or de novo  and most children show a normal phenotype. The second type has 15q euchromatin including PWS/ASCR [dic(15)(q12 or q13)], that frequently derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis. This condition is associated with an abnormal phenotype, which constitutes the idic(15) syndrome, and is nearly always sporadic.The inv dup (15) displays distinctive clinical findings represented by early central hypotonia and intellectual disability, epilepsy and autistic behaviour.

Minor dysmorphic features were observed with upslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, mild retrognathia and protruding upper lip with long philtrum. Growth parameters at 7 years are in the normal range.CGH analysis showed a 2.015 Mb deletion distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. The deletion is maternally inherited. The family belongs to underprivileged socio cultural environment with relatives presenting learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities. Given this blurring familial situation, this deletion was initially considered as being  of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore polymorphic CNV were reported in this region.Two publications (Edelmann et al., 2007 ; J Med Genet 44:136 143 and Ramocki et al., 2010 ; Am J Hum Genet 87:857 865) reported  deletions or duplications distal to the Williams Beuren deletion.

303,36, De Novo Mutations in Neurodevelopmental disorders,S10.3,,"INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual deficiency (ID) are common, devastating and poorly treated neurodevelopmental brain disorders. The wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical variability in these disorders suggest a complex genetic etiology, which is consistent with the numerous loci thus far identified by linkage, copy number variation and association studies. Although heritability in all three disorders may be as high as ~80%, the genes responsible for much ESHG Concurrent Symposia  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org12 www.eshg.orgof this heritability remain to be identified. Based on the observed redu  ced reproductive fitness, the relatively uniform world wide incidence, the  increased risk of disease with increasing paternal age and the phenotypic  complexity of each disease, we, and others, hypothesized that a fraction of this missing heritability may be the result of the occurrence of de novo mu  tations affecting any of a large number of genes. In order to test this hypo thesis we first sequenced over 400 synaptic genes in 148 subjects with SCZ, 148 subjects with ASD and 96 subjects with ID. Many likely de novo mutati   ons were identified   these plus relevant functional studies will be presen   ted. Next we sequenced the exomes of SCZ, ASD and ID probands, plus their parents, identifying numerous additional de novo mutations (DNMs). In ad  dition, 1/4 of identified DNMs are nonsense mutations, which is more than  what is expected by chance. Interestingly, some of the identified genes, such  as SHANK3, show deleterious de novo mutations in patients from the three  disease cohorts, suggesting close biological overlap in these disorders. Our  study supports the notion that DNMs may account for some of the missing  heritability SCZ, ASD and ID while providing a list of genes possibly involved in disease pathogenesis.",2012.0,,"G. A.

However, only a few patients  with a microdeletion including the HIP1 gene, located in the distal region  of 7q11.23, have been reported. These patients show a neurodevelopmen tal and epilepsy syndrome. HIP1 encodes huntingtin interacting protein 1  which is normally expressed in the brain. HIP1 knockout mice develop a  progressive neurologic phenotype with tremor and gait ataxia. Therefore, HIP1 haploinsufficiency has been proposed to lead to cognitive and beha vioural dysfunction in these patients. We present a 4 year old girl with mo  tor and speech delay, mild ataxia, and behavioral problems including im  pulsivity, aggression and mild autistic features. She showed facial dysmor   phism, including a short nose with anteverted nares, downturned corners  of the mouth, and a full lower lip, reminiscent of patients with WBS. Array  CGH analysis revealed an intragenic 14 23kb deletion in the distal region 7q11.23, which leads to loss of exons 5 to 8 of HIP1. The deletion detected  in this patient overlaps with a recurrent distal deletion in 7q11.23 in the  patients reported by Ramocki et al. (2010). Those patients had similar cli nical features, including intellectual disabilities, neurobehavioral problems and in addition epilepsy. However, no information about facial dysmorphism  was reported.

After  image acquisition by confocal laser scaning microscope, analysis of relative  spatial positioning of three painted regions was performed. The results sho   wed that neighborhood association of particular two chromosome territory  regions called as chromosome kissing was observed with high frequency  between Xq and 16p and between 11p and 16p in cell nuclei from the ATR X syndrome patients, respectively. The frequency of the same combination from the normal individual is approximately halves of them, respectively.

Monserrato,Cagliari, Italy., Monserrato( Cagliari), Italy. We re examined ten patients with normal and/or abnormal karyotypes and dysmorphic features, associated with Mental Retardation, Autism and/or Epilepsy. We applied a fast BAC Genome Array  CGH platform (Cytochips Blue gnome, Techno genetics   Bouty). Cyto Chips are high quality BAC microarrays (4898 BAC Clones spotted in quadruplicate 0.6 Mb). This ap proach led us to discover further cryptic chromosomal rearrangements, pre viously undetected by conventional cytogenetic procedures. We identified two genes: SLC8A3 (human gene for member 3 of solute carrier family 8), a  sodium calcium exchanger electively expressed in the brain, and a possible candidate gene for Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2010) and the CSMD1 gene (Cub  and sushi multiple domains 1) a candidate gene for Autism associated with Mental Retardation (MR) and Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2011). This approach allows us to better delineate the genotype/phenotype correlation in our pa tients.

332,530, Clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with de novo 0.45 Mb deletion of 2p16.1,P03.102,,"The widespread use of microarray methods has contributed to the identi fication of several new rare microdeletion syndromes including that asso   ciated with deletions of 2p15 p16.1. The 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndro me is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, microcephaly, growth retardation, facial abnormalities, disturbed vision and other symptoms. We report here an 11 year old autistic girl showing clinical features consistent with the syndrome. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of the patient showed a normal female karyotype. Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 BeadChip analysis revealed a 0.45 Mb long deletion of the paternal allele of  2p16.1. FISH analysis confirmed the deletion in the patient but not in any of  her parents. The deleted region contains only 3 protein coding RefSeq ge  nes, BCLA11, PAPOLG and REL, and 1 long non coding RNA gene FLJ16341. Based on high phenotype similarity of our patient with 6 reported patients  showing the typical phenotype of the 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome  we propose that the critical region of the syndrome can be narrowed down and that these brain expressed genes can be considered candidates for the clinical symptoms. However, multiple deletions of variable length within  the interval between 2p14 and 2p16.1 have been described in patients with  intellectual disability but not necessarily the other typical symptoms of the syndrome and some of these deletions do not overlap. This observati  on indicates that also other genes located in this broader unstable region  are associated with cognitive functioning.

This  finding leads to the suggestion that all cases of undiagnosed MR should be  screened for subtelomeric aberration. Nevertheless, resolution of standard karyotyping using G banding is limited and cannot detect this anomaly.  Therefore, in this study, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification  (MLPA) technique, was used to screen 129 patients with idiopathic MR.  Twelve of them were also diagnosed with autistic disorder. We identified 5 patients (3.87%) with subtelomeric aberration. All have MR with normal ka ryotypes. One patient has a submicroscopic deletion at 1p36.33 which was  confirmed by real time PCR. There are two patients with subtelomeric du  plication at 15q11.2 and 11p15.5 subsequently. Two patients have the same  duplication at Xp22.33. Results were confirmed by using additional MLPA probes. Parental samples were also examined when available. Interestingly the deletion at 1p36.33 and duplication at Xp22.33 fall into the regions whe  re copy number variation (CNV) have been reported. However the patholo   gic effect of these aberrations is still inconclusive. Further characterization  of these aberration boundaries and screening in normal population should be performed.

361,1709, Investigation of mitochondrial tRNA Thr and tRNAPro genes mutations in autism,J09.38,,"Objectives: Autism as one of three recognized condition in the autism spec trum disorders (ASDs) is a neurodevelopmental, multifactorial disorder. Autism is noticeably reported to be affected by mitochondrial dysfunction which impairs energy metabolism. mtDNA encodes 22 tRNAs working as amino acid transporters for synthesis of the respiratory chain enzymes. In volvement of mutations within tRNA genes have been well documented in mitochondrial disorders. In this study, tRNA Pro and tRNAThr were investigated  to find mutations which are related to autism pathogenesis, as these two genes mutations have been reported to be involved in some neurological disorders.Methods: In this study, a cohort of 24 unrelated idiopathic patients and 100 ethnically matched Persian control individuals were obtained. PCR sequen   cing of mtDNA fragments was employed to investigate the involvement of mitochondrial variations in autism.Results: A substitution , G15928A, was identified in two groups without a significant difference (P , 0.179, P> 0.05). A new homoplasmic substitusion, A15973G, was identified within the T loop of tRNA Pro gene in 1 patient as  it had not been reported before. This variation is moderatelyly conserved (75 %) among species and also, was not detected in blood sample from the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother.Conclusion: Investigation on mitochondrial varations may strengthen the role of genetics in association with autism.

We extended the GWAS to a discovery cohort of  1,995 cases with various CHD phenotypes. A region on chromosome 4p16, between MSX1 and STX18, was associated (P,9.5x10  7) with the risk of atrial  septal defect (ASD; N,340 cases), and this was replicated in a further 445 ASD cases and 2520 controls (replication P,1.1x10  4; combined P,6.9x10  10). The association between SNPs at 12q24 and TOF was not apparent in  any other CHD subgroup; similarly, the association between SNPs at 4p16 and ASD was not apparent for CHD phenotypes other than ASD.

A few patients with larger and smaller WBS deletion have been reported. They  show clinical features that vary between isolated SVAS to the full spectrum  of WBS phenotype, associated with epilepsy or autism spectrum behavior.We describe four patients with atypical 7q11.23 deletions identified by mul   tiple ligation probe amplification analysis and fine mapping by quantitative real time PCR. Two carry an approximately 3.5 Mb larger deletion towards the telomere that includes HIP1  and YWHAG genes. Other two carry a shor   ter deletion of approximately 1.2 Mb at centromeric side that excludes the  distal WBS genes BAZ1B  and FZD9 , respectively. Along with previously reported cases, genotype phenotype correlation in  the patients described here further suggests that haploinsufficiency of HIP1   and YWHAG might cause the severe neurological and neuropsychological  deficits including epilepsy and autistic traits and that the preservation of BAZ1B  and FZD9  genes may be related to mild facial features and moderate  neuropsychological deficits.

Array CGH using Agilent detected a 2Mb loss in Xp22.33 and 4,5Mb gain in Xp22.2p22.12. The deleted region contains 12 genes of which CSFRA and Shox are known as OMIM Morbid Genes. The duplicated region contains 7 OMIM morbid Genes. We used late replicating chromatin technique to detect the pattern of X inactivation. we found that 70% of the translocated X is the inactive one, in the same time the translocated chro mosome 14 escape inactivation, while in 30% the normal X is the inactivate one leaving the abnormal X as the active one. The clinical picture may be affected by the haploinsufficiency of the genes that are known to escape X inactivation and lie within the deleted region (Xp22.33), or it is affected by duplicated genes (Xp22.2p22.12) on the abnormal X when it was the active one.

Extremely rare is association of Phelan McDer   mid syndrome and hepatic failure in early childhood. There have been de  scribed only 2 patients with this condition so far. In these cases PIM3 gene  (localized in 22q13.33) was considered to be responsible. We present 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with Phelan McDermid syn drome. Age at diagnosis ranges from 10 month to 55 years and deletion ex   tent varies from 0.4 Mb to 7.6 Mb. All patients present common features  of the syndrome, but they differ in inconstant sypmtoms. Any correlations  between phenotype and deletion range havenâ²t been observed.Patients have been diagnosed using FISH and MLPA, deletion extents were  proven by oligonucleotide arrayCGH. There are 6 patients with deleted PIM3 gene in our group, including two adult patients, but only one of these patients (10 year old boy with 1.9 Mb  long deletion) has developed hepatic failure recently. Therefore simple PIM3  deletion doesnâ²t seem to be the cause of hepatic failure.The possible mechanism is an alteration of the gene on the other allele, epi genetic factors or mutation in some modifier genes.

Among synaptic proteins deregulated by the absence of Fmrp in fmr1  knock out  (KO) mice (murine model for FXS), Kcnma1 (Î± subunit of large conductance Ca 2+ activated potassium channels, BKCa) seems to be the most significant  deregulated one. Since several papers showed an involvement of BKCa chan nels in MD, this channel could be a new therapeutic target for FXS. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the molecular BKCa channel anomaly in fmr1  KO mouse model and 2) to evaluate the thera  peutic effect of a BKCa channel opener molecule (BCOM), BMS 204352, on dendritic spines maturation of fmr1  KO neurons and on social behavior of  fmr1  KO mice. In fmr1  KO mice, Kcnma1 protein quantity was lower in ce  rebral structures and neurons, and associated with a reduced BKCa whole cell current. In vitro addition of BMS 204352 induced dendrite spines ma  turation of fmr1  KO neurons. In vivo, using a behavioral test of direct social  interaction, a single injection of BMS 204352 rescued affiliative behaviors to wild type level. In conclusion, we demonstrated 1) a Kcnma1 protein anomaly in fmr1  KO  mice inducing a decrease in BKCa whole cell current, and 2) that a BCOM, BMS 204352, restored a regular phenotype of dendrite spines and social interaction in fmr1  KO mice.

A genotype phenotype correlation?,P05.070,,"Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the deletion or disruption of a 22q13 region containing the post synaptic protein gene SHANK3 . The clinical features of PMS (also known  as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and otherdevelopmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmor   phic features. Other less frequent features include seizures, brain, renal and cardiac malformations, motor deficits, and lymphedema Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, Clinical expression also varies widely, even among patients with small deletions, and no correlation between deletion size and phenotype has been found. A role for additional genetic factors, in addition to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, is likely. Because PMS is considered  to be underdiagnosed, the true prevalence is unknown. Aims. We aim to define a possible genotype phenotype comparison to use  high resolution deletion breakpoint mapping on a large cohort of patients, addressed the hypothesis that additional genes or regions of chromosome  22q13 besides SHANK3 may contribute to the PMS phenotype. Results. Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for more than 50  individuals in a patient cohort using a custom designed high resolution oli  gonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform, prompting  this genotype phenotype association study. Most of them have been studied by FISH, MLPA and array CGH and their clinical features have been defined.

We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p.Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family.

400,684,Plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin in Fragile X syndrome,P05.104,,"MedykÃ³w 18,, Katowice, Poland,  3Department of Pathophysiology Medical University of Silesia, ul. MedykÃ³w 18,,  Katowice, Poland. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation respon   sible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1  gene resulting in its transcriptional silencing. Leptin may be  considered a cytokine like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, immune system, in addition to its role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. Thus, we hypothesized on in volvement of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of autism.Material and methods23 male patients, mean age 19,3 Â± 6,6, affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1  gene), were enrolled into the study. Controls were 24  healthy males, mean age 21,8 Â± 5,8. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA method.ResultsPlasma leptin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients were similar as in con trol group (11,53 Â± 10,24 ng/ml) vs (5,73 Â± 4,52) were not significantly dif   ferent from those found in controls (p , 0,5).While plasma adiponectin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients (6,68 Â± 3,44 ng/ml) were significantly lower in controls (8,95 Â± 4,24) (p< 0,04).ConclusionAdiponectin may be involved in autistic features observed in FXS patients in light of its anti inflammatory properties.

It consists of 13 exons and encodes a  protein of 635 amino acids. This disorder causes an increase of creatine le vels in urine and plasma, and urinary creatine/creatinine ratio. The clinical presentation of males affected is mental retardation, expressive speech and language delay, epilepsy, developmental delay and autistic behaviour.Subjects and Methods: An 8 year old male patient presents learning diffi   culties, behaviour disorder and epilepsy. An increase of creatine/creatinine ratio, guanidineacetate and glycine levels (plasma and urine) was detected. The 13 exons of the SLC6A8 gene, including the intron exon junctions, were  analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction.Results: We detected a 34 pb deletion (c.1016+11_1017 52del34) in intron 6, that was predicted to cause an aberrant splicing into acceptor splice site. At the cDNA level, this mutation produces a 30 pb deletion in exon 7 and a single amino acid insertion (p. K339_S349delinsN). This variant was not detected in the mother and is therefore considered de novo.Discussion: DNA and RNA analysis were necessary to characterize this novel pathogenic mutation. The detected change in the creatine transporter could be responsible for a lower and/or no activity of the protein. Functional stu dies in cultured skin fibroblasts will be necessary to show  a deficiency of the  creatine transporter function.   J. Aguirre Lamban: None. C. Cervera Acedo:  None. E. Sarasola: None.

410,728,The association analysis of ABHD11 gene (rs2293484 and rs10279013 with autism in a South African population.,P06.05,,"Background : Autism is genetically inherited neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant impairments of social interaction, difficulties in communication and displays of restrictive or repetitive behaviors activi ties and interests. Genome scan data have pointed towards the long arm of chromosome 7 as a strong candidate region. Various association and linkage studies are being undertaken in order to screen candidate genes mapping to the long arm of chromosome 7 as susceptibility loci. The anhydrolase do   main containing 11 gene (ABHD11) is located on 7q11.23 which is a hotspot region for autism. This gene has not been investigated for its association to autism. Aims : The aim of this study was to investigate the association of two SNPs from genes ABHD11 (rs2293484 and rs10279013) in South African autistic population.Methods : A total of 435 individuals were recruited in cluding 217 autistic and 218 control subjects. The Taqman Â®Real Time PCR and geno typing assay was utilized to determine the genotypes. Results: A significant association of SNP rs10279013 but not for SNP rs229348 with autism in the South African (SA) population is observed. Conclusion: There might be a possible role of ABHD11 in autism especially for SA populations.

412,730,Missing heritability of Korean patient with autism spectrum disorder(ASD),P06.07,,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been identified SNPs asso   ciated with complex traits. However, a great deal of the heritable variation associated with common traits remains unaccounted for within the geno me. The objective of this study is to discover large parts of additive gene tic variance not typically associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through GWAS in Korean population and estimates of ASD heritability.Subjects with ASD were recruited through the Korean Autism Genetic Study Consortium. Each child was diagnosed as ASD by using the Korean versions of ADOS and ADI R (Lord et al. 1994; Lord et al. 1997).Total 146 patients were genotyped on the Affymetrix 5.0 platform. Geno   type data for n,858 sex matched controls were drawn from the Korea As sociation Resource database. Genotype data were filtered for <5% missing   ness/sample or /SNP; MAF >0.01; HWE p>0.0001. Cases were verified as unrelated using identity by descent estimation in PLINK v1.07. In order to examine the missing heritability in ASD, we applied genome wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) to 142 case and 842 controls after data filtering.The results identified phenotypic variants of 84.5% (Â±0.313 SE) with affec ted status of ASD, 7.0% (Â±0.027 SE) with topGWAS SNPs (Â± 1mb region) and 81.0%(Â± 0.313 SE) with nonGWAS SNPs. Increase from the genetic variance identified by top GWAS hits region indicates there might be more risk loci to be identified. Our results suggest that many common variants of small effect remain to be discovered, although GWAS is useful in identifying the most common variants associated with ASD.  J.E. Park: None. S.A.

In a genome wide CNVs screening performed by the AGP , a rare inherited  microdeletion, disrupting two genes transcribed in the same direction,  KLHL23 and SSB, was identified in an Italian ASD individual. This deletion, potentially resulting in a gene fusion transcript, causes a frameshift with the  introduction of a premature stop codon. No fusion transcript was detected  by RT PCR, suggesting that it is subject to ânonsense mediated mRNA decayâ. KLHL23 encodes for a brain expressed Kelch repeat protein of unknown function. While several CNVs affecting SSB are reported in controls making  it an unikely dosege sensitive gene, no CNVs have been previously described  in KLHL23. KLHL23 expression analysis in peripheral blood of the CNV car riers did not show reduction of RNA levels, although we canât exclude that  the deletion could have an effect on the brain. In a mutation screening of KLHL23 in 85 multiplex familis with ASD we identified a damaging variant (M65V), absent in controls, and segregating  with the ASD in an affected sibling pair. Taken together our results suggest that rare variants altering KLHL23 func tion in the brain, could contribute to ASD risk in a small number of cases.  S. Lomartire: None. E. Bacchelli: None. F.

As autism is one of the most debilitating neurocognitive disorders and only cli nical criteria are available, some more effective and not so subjective signs are needed.

On the other hand, the con  tribution of non heritable genomic alterations to the pathogenesis is hardly  appreciated. Here, we have assessed post zygotic autosomal aneuploidy in prefrontal cortex of the diseased and normal brain by molecular cytogenetic  techniques (FISH and interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding  with DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18). Twel  ve autistic, 19 schizophrenic and 27 control samples provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental disorders, University of Maryland and bank of our institute were analyzed. Aneuploidy rate per autosome was 0.3  0.8% in all three cohorts analyzed (0.46%, 0.62% and 0.59%). However, we  observed statistically significant increase of chromosome 9 aneuploidy in  the autistic brain. In schizophrenia, chromosome 1 and 18 aneuploidy rates were significantly increased. Additionally, we performed array CGH and in silico analysis of our data on genomic rearrangements in childhood neuro  developmental diseases (124 individuals) and found that CNV burdens in  these individuals typically affect two pathways specific for brain cells: cell  cycle regulation and programmed cell death. We concluded that somatic genome variation (chromosome specific mosaic aneuploidy) is a non heri   table genetic factor contributing to pathogenesis of brain disorders, that is,  however, a result of specific CNV burdens.

419,737,Targeted high throughput gene sequencing of the NMDA receptor multi protein complex and high resolution genomic study of 100 families with autism spectrum disorder,P06.17,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early childhood neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a significant genetic aetiology and a prevalence  currently estimated at 1/100. Epidemiological studies described that ASDs  are heterogeneous at both clinical and genetic levels, which has been further illustrated by the large number of loci and genes that have been identified to  date (>100). Several biological pathways have been highlighted, particularly  the NMDA receptor multiprotein (NRC) complex, affected by copy number variations (CNV) and mutations enriched in NRC proteins encoding genes.We performed a global genetic study of 100 French families including at least 1 individual with ASD, which was included in the research project âNeurophysiological Molecular and Developmental Analysis of the Glutama   te Synapse in Autism (NMDA Autism)â (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).For each family, we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic compa rative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array for   mat to identify rare or de novo CNVs; Secondly, a high throughput targeted sequencing of 216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene mutations in our cohort.Preliminary results on CGH experiments led us to identify small rare CNVs in several known regions (20p12.1 MACROD2; 18q21.1 KATNAL2; 11p13.11) or novel potential candidates such as FRMPD4, GUCY2F and NXPH3.

The se subjects may develop the Fragile X associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and parkinsonism. In addition, people carrying the premutation can be affected by a set of neurological and behavioural disorders during young age. Memory problems have been detected in these patients as well as in the mouse mo del for FXTAS. In those animals, by transcriptome analysis we have shown a profound deregulation of the expression levels of genes involved in learning, memory and autistic behavior, Parkinson disease and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest the presence of a synapthopathy (Zongaro et al., HMG, 2013). Furthermore, we studied gene expression profiles of whole brain ob tained from both young and old FXTAS mice. We observed that in this context different neurodegenerative pathways are involved at different ages. In FXTAS mice, we also studied the expression level of several microRNAs that target FMR1 mRNA and we observed that one them, miR 221, is down regulated  at the synapse of young FXTAS mice and in the full brain of the older ones.  Interestingly, many of those deregulated mRNAs at the synapse, as well as in whole brain, are target of miR 221. These findings suggest a network regula  tion   including miRNAs and mRNAs  for FMR1 mRNA.  S. Zongaro: None. R. Hukema: None. R. Willemsen: None. B. Mari: None. B.  Bardoni: None.",2013.0,,"S.

The use of array CGH substantially improves the diagnosis of chromosomal  abnormalities that are not evident by conventional karyotype. Recently in an extended family with global developmental delay and autistic features,  a novel Xq12 q13.3 duplication was identified which contained amongst  others TAF1, GJB1 genes .(Kaya et al.2012).The GJB1 gene is associated with  morphology of myelin sheath and peripheral neuropathy, while TAF1  has  been linked with torsion dystonia  3. We present the clinical and molecular findings in two unrelated patients  with Xq13.1 duplication. The first one is a 5 year old boy with truncal hy   potonia, low deep tendon reflexes and proximal weakness. The other pati   ent is a 16 year old boy with progressive difficulties in walking, tremor and  learning disorder, while his mother has an identical positive family history in three deceased males. High resolution 4X180K Agilent arrays used in the  study (> 236.000 probes, average resolution of 8.9 Kb) revealed a duplicati   on on Xq13.1 (0.423 Mb) containing the TAF1 and GJB1 genes in both pati   ents, while the second patient had an additional deletion on 17q21.31 (0.63  Mb) containing KANSL1  gene.

Due to its relative invasiveness it is essential to identify any adverse effects on the long term development of children born as a result of PGD.Aim: The aim of this study was to measure and evaluate developmental neu  ropsychological profiles of 4 5 year old children born after PGD relative to norms representing the general population.Materials and methods: Twenty seven, 4 5 year old, PGD children were recruited. Participants were subjected to a battery of neuropsychological assessments including: WPPSI III(cognitive development), PLS 4(language development), WRAVMA(visual motor abilities), CARS2(screening test for autistic spectrum disorders) and the Miles ABC Test(ocular dominance). Pa rental questionnaires regarding executive function and demographics were performed as well. Each subjectâs tests results were compared to each testâs norms as provided by the test authors. When available, Israeli norms were used for comparison.Results: Children born after PGD showed scores within the normal or above normal ranges for all developmental outcomes. The mean WPPSI Full Scale Intelligence Quotient and Verbal Intelligence Quotient were signi ficantly higher than the general population(P,0.013), although not clinically significant(100Â±15). All other tests performed within normal test ranges.Conclusions: This pilot study shows that children conceived after PGD dis   play normal developmental neuropsychological outcomes at age 4 5 years when compared to age matched normal children in the general population.

The phenotype of the 9 p duplication syndrome is clinically recognizable, and phenotype/genotype correlations suggested that the critical region is located on 9p22. We report on a rare case of a tri somy for the whole short arm of chromosome 9 resulting from a de novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation. A 3 year old girl was referred to genetic counselling because of facial dysmorphism, seizures, and moderate mental retardation. MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) was interpreted as normal. Chromosome analysis revealed a 46,XX,der(15)add(15)(p11) karyotype. Parental karyotypes were normal. Thus, we conclude that this chromosomal rearrangement occurred de novo. In order to identify this additional materi   al on chromosome 15, we performed array CGH (Nimbelgen Whole genome tiling135K HG18) that showed a duplication of the whole short arm of chro mosome 9. No other imbalances were found elsewhere in the genome. FISH studies performed with whole chromosome 15 and chromosome 9 painting probes confirmed that the chromosomal material added on chromosome 15 derived from 9p. Our observation is unique because the duplication of the whole short arm of chromosome 9 without monosomy of another chromo some and resulting from a de novo unbalanced translocation was never re ported.

Trio Exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, but re mains costly for general implementation. We thus tested targeted exon se   quencing of 217 genes previously implicated in X linked ID, or in autosomal dominant or recessive forms in which ID is the major clinical concern. We analyzed 106 patients (mostly males and sporadic cases) with molecularly undiagnosed ID. One third of them harbored autistic features.We identified causative mutations in 26 patients: sixteen in X linked ge nes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD , FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1 , IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA,  MECP2, SLC9A6 , SLC16A2, PHF8), 10 de novo in autosomal genes (DYRK1A ,  GRIN1 , MED13L , TCF4, RAI1 , SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 ). We detected likely  causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3  for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge  nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit  more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions.  The identification of mutations in 25 29% of patients proves the diagnostic efficiency of this strategy, higher than CGH and comparable to trio exome sequencing at lesser cost.

Anophthalmia/microphthalmia (A/M) is a genetically heterogeneous birth defect for which the etiology remains unknown in more than 50% patients. A/M can occur without other structural eye defects (simplex A/M), or can be present with other ocular findings (complex A/M), such as anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). We used exome sequencing (ACE ExomeTM, Personalis, Inc., 18 exomes; UCSF Genomics Core, 20 exomes; 6 were run twice) to se   quence DNA from 32 children with A/M or other developmental eye defects for pathogenic mutations. In 19 patients with simplex A/M, we identified mutations in STRA6 (1 patient), RARB (1 patient; p.Arg387Cys), GDF6 (1 pa tient; p.Ala249Glu) and OTX2 (1 patient; p.Gln91His) and in 9 patients with complex A/M, we found mutations in STRA6 in 2 patients.

Current evidence  suggests it is involved in neuronal development and maturation, and it has  recently been highlighted as potentially playing a key role in the evolution of the human brain. Clinically, NPAS3 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and numerous studies have supported this association. In addition, several cases of learning disabilities in patients with disruptions of this gene are reported, but this association remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present four unrelated individuals with small copy number vari ants (CNVs) within NPAS3: two intragenic duplications and two intragenic deletions. These CNVs range between 111 460kb in length and encompass  exonic sequences within the NPAS3 gene. All four patients had variable de   grees of developmental delay, and three had subtle distinctive facial features.  Two patients also had macrosomia and macrocephaly, while the other two had autistic features and behaviour issues, including psychosis in one indivi dual. In contrast, CNVs involving exonic sequences in NPAS3 have only been seen in one of over 19,000 controls. In summary, these four cases support an association between NPAS3 and developmental delay.

Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists.

The duplicated region (9.4 Mb) contains numerous genes and the authors pointed out the possible role of an increased dosage of specific genes focusing on their presumed role in developmental delay and autism. Subsequent reports (Prontera et al. 2012; Wentz et al. 2013) described 4 more patients with a variable association of severe global developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphism and autism spectrum disorder, all car rying a duplication in the Xq12 q13.3 region, supporting the existence of a clinically recognizable X linked recessive disorder. We describe a further patient affected by global developmental delay, epilepsy, autistic traits and carrying two non contiguous duplications detected by array CGH, involving Xq12 and Xq13 regions. Detailed clinical description is provided and com pared to previous reported cases. Due to the narrowed size of the duplicated regions (123 Kb and 509 Kb, respectively), this case helps to redefine the region of interest for this condition.

479,778, S Three SNP haplotypes in Neuroligins may correlate to autism susceptibility,P09.021,,"Chemistry  and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain.Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi   dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion.In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment.

487,858, S The role of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor in epileptogenesis,P09.105,,"NMDA receptors are tetrameric ligand gated ion channels composed of two glycine binding NR1 subunits and two glutamate binding NR2 subunits (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) regulating synaptic plasticity. Mutations in the NR2A and NR2B subunits encoded by the genes GRIN2A  and GRIN2B  have  been associated with different phenotypes of intellectual disability (ID). Mutations in GRIN2A  were known to cause unspecific ID and epilepsy as  well as other neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas mutations in GRIN2B have mainly been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but not seizures. We show for the first time that mutations of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor cause different and specific epilepsy phenotypes. NR2 muta   tions are involved in benign Rolandic epilepsy, the most frequent childhood epilepsy as well as in a variety of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathi es, such as Landau Kleffner and West syndrome. Furthermore, we demon   strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign  Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre  sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations. The severity of phenotypes depends on the af fected domain and the extent of receptor activation. Our observations high light the so far underestimated role of dysregulated NMDA signalling in both frequent and rare epilepsy disorders and reveal promising pharmacologic targets for novel therapeutic approaches.",2014.0,,"J.

519,2041, Genetic alterations of postsynaptic NMDA receptor related complex are associated with autism spectrum disorder,J09.59,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early childhood neurodevelopmen tal disorder characterized by a significant genetic aetiology and prevalence currently estimated at 1/100. Several biological pathways have been high lighted, particularly the excitatory synapse, affected by copy number varia tions (CNV) and enrichment in mutations in genes belonging to the NMDA  receptor complex (NRC). We performed a global genetic study of 100 French  families including at least 1 individual with autism, who were included in the research project (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).Our project aimed to evaluate both the contribution of CNV in ASD, and  secondly the presence of mutations in the NRC complex. For each family,  we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array format to identify  rare or de novo CNVs. In parallel, a high throughput targeted sequencing of  216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex (179) was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene  mutations in our cohort. The first results of our study allowed us to characterize candidates and li kely pathogens genetic alterations in at least 10% of patient. We have found mutations or CNV in genes encoding receptors (NLGN4X, GRM5 ), and in cy   tosolic (UPF3B), nuclear (MACROD2), and synaptic (NXPH3) proteins.

Its deletion is one of the most frequent known etiologies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while this deletion and reciprocal duplication are associated with mirror phenotypes on BMI, head circumference and brain volume. We observed complex chromatin looping between genes located in the proximal 600kb BP4 BP5 and those mapping to the distal 16p11.2 220kb BP2 BP3 region, two loci separated by 650kb, successfully confir   med by reciprocal 4C, FISH, Hi C and associations between active regula   tory regions. Phenotyping of 137 unrelated carriers of distal 16p11.2 220 kb BP2 BP3 deletion and duplication showed that these CNVs are similarly associated with ASD and reciprocal impacts on BMI and HC.Our results indicate that chromosomal contactsÃ¢ÂÂ maps could uncover func tionally and clinically related genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, loci chromatin contacted by our selected viewpoints are enriched for ASD genes (OR,2.15, P,1.65e 08). Furthermore, we uncovered 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 chromatin loops with (i) the 1q21.1 cytoband, whose deletions and du plications were previously linked to micro  and macrocephaly, respectively; (ii) PTEN, mutations of which are associated with a macrocephalic form of ASD; and (iii) the 2p15 cytoband. We enrolled 35 carriers of 2p15 16.1 de   letion and duplication and showed that they similarly display mirror pheno types on HC and weight.Finally, we observe that genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 BP4 BP5 CNV carriers are concomitantly modified in their chromatin interactions, suggesting that disruption of chromatin interplays participates in the ob   served phenotypes.

So far, seven genes from this pathway have been reported in human disease.  Five of them are involved in autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X linked (SMC1A and HDAC8) Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and two of them  in autosomal recessive Roberts (ESCO2) and Warsaw Breakage syndromes  (DDX11). All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which,  along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3  males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel  lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency. Three had history of intrauterine growth retardation, two with prenatal onset  microcephaly, one with post natal growth retardation. One individual had  epilepsy, two had autistic features. The four patients shared common facial features, with widely spaced incisors, thin eyebrows, and high nasal bridge. The mechanism for haploinsufficiency was a small deletion encompassing  STAG1 diagnosed by array CGH in two individuals, an intragenic deletion in  STAG1 found by whole genome analysis in one individual, and a missense heterozygous mutation (c.641A>G) revealed by exome analysis in the last patient.

541,687, De novo 19p13.2 microdeletion encompassing the part of NFIX gene in a girl with Sotos like phenotype,PM08.02,,"19p13.2 microdeletion is a rare genomic disorder. To date, less than ten cases was described so far in the literature. This chromosomal syndrome manifests in developmental delay/intellectual impairment, postnatal over   growth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphy, slender habitus, advanced bone age, and scoliosis. Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent. Very similar phenotype is observed in the Sotos syndrome 2 (MIM #614753) that is caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions of the NFIX gene located on chromosome 19p13.2.Here, we report on the case of a 7 year old girl referred to genetic counse   ling because of psychomotor retardation, speech delay and dysmorphic fea tures (macrocephaly, long/narrow and triangular face, high forehead, fron tal bossing, downslanting palpebral fissures, dysplastic low set ears, small nose, flat philtrum, micrognathia). At the examination, behavioral problems (anxiety, tantrums, autoaggression), seizures, and poor coordination were noted. Skeletal anomalies (advanced bone age, joint laxity, slender hands with long fingers, abnormal setting of the lower limbs), strabismus, hypero pia as well as constipations and abdominal pain were also diagnosed.Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a de novo 158.18 kb (the smallest so far) deletion of 19p13.2 region (chr19:13,020,206 13,178,390; hg19) encompassing seven genes; three of them (NFIX, DAND5 and CALR) could be the candidate genes for the genotype phenotype rela   tionship.This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13.2 microdeletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region.

545,708, A novel HCN1 mutation not associated with epileptic encephalopathy,PS08.23,,"B. Rossi Hospital, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita  bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy   perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety  of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity.  Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as  sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi  leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with  different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits. Here we report the case of a 9 year old girl with a Rett like phenotype, cha  racterized by intellectual disability, hand stereotypies, absent speech, nega tive brain MRI and EEG data and no history of epilepsy. By NGS approach,  with the use of a targeted intellectual disability/epilepsy gene panel, we  found the girl to carry a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the HCN1 gene. This mutation is located in the glycine tyrosine glycine (GYG) motif, which constitutes the ion selectivity filter typical of K+  permeable channels. This motif is highly conserved structurally and functio  nally during evolution.This is the first report of a HCN1 mutation involved in a neurodevelopmen  tal phenotype without epilepsy.",2015.0,,"E.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects.We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con   tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase.This innovative strategy to collect information on natural history and co morbidities of rare monogenic forms of ID/autism will promote familiesÃ¢ÂÂ empowerment and hopefully impact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ care.

Copy number variations (CNV) in RBFOX1, also known as A2BP1, have been associated with human neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disease.This gene, spanning 1.7 MB on chromosome 16p13.3, is one of the largest genes in the human genome, responsible for encoding splicing regulatory factors, specifically expressed in neurons and muscles, and having a regula  tory action in alternative splicing of a large tissue specific gene networks. Materials and methods: Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, using an Agi  lent 4x180K platform, was performed in 1200 patients with mental retarda tion, autism spectrum disorders and congenital anomalies. Results: In our cohort, we identified 6 cases with intragenic deletions in RB  FOX1, 4 of them with additional CNV in other chromosomes. These CNVs are located at 16p13.3, extended in a 1,2Mb region between 6,087,983 7   ,207,012 (GRCh37/hg19), which corresponds to intronic regions in 5 out of  6 patients. Five of these patients have an inherited deletion, from an unaffec  ted progenitor, and one has an unknown inheritance pattern.Conclusions: The phenotypes of all these children have in common, as wide  ly described, neurological alterations.

In this study we addressed the possible contri bution of epigenetic factors to ASD etiology, focusing on deregulated Mi croRNAs (miRNAs) expression. miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. miRNAs are thought to be released from pathological tissues to plasma in illness situations, and the strong correlation between circulating and tissue miRNAs indicates that plasma miRNAs may be useful disease biomarkers.Methods: miRNA plasma profiles were obtained for patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), essentially disruptive beha vior, language delay and psychomotor delay. Patients were all male, with a mean developmental coefficient of 92ÃÂ±18, and no obvious dysmorphisms.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental condi   tion with highly complex genetic predisposition. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of both sequence and structural rare variations in ASD susceptibility. In particular, focusing on rare copy number variants (CNVs) has already been highly productive in uncovering an increasing num ber of specific genes and chromosomal intervals conferring risk to ASD.During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach on 9 multiplex ASD families from Sardinia, we identified a rare genic deletion of ~37 Kb, transmitted from the unaffected mother to both affected siblings. This deletion includes the entire CAPG gene and the last coding exons of  ELMOD3 . CAPG encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin re  gulatory proteins, that might be involved in control of dendritic spine shape. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, with recently proposed functional links to sound perception and actin cytoske leton.No deletions involving this genomic region were found in 4768 controls from published high resolution SNP array data, while other two deletions encompassing CAPG and ELMOD3 have been reported in two subjects with  ASD, suggesting that CAPG and/or ELMOD3 haploinsufficiency may have  clinical relevance to ASD. In order to test this hypothesis together with a recessive model of inheritance, we first excluded that this deletion is a com mon polymorphism in Sardinia, then we performed expression and muta   tion analysis of both genes in the discovery pedigree, and a further clinical evaluation of all family members.Grant references: Fondazione Banco di Sardegna, Kyulan Family Foundati o",2015.0,,"E.

Different phenotypes and clinical findings are caused by the number of ge nes deleted on the 4p16.3 locus.Here we represent the clinical findings of three patients who have deletion on 4p16.3 chromosomal locus. Size of the deletions were different from each other.The first patient is a 3,5  year old female who has afebrile convulsion, hea ring loss and speech delay. Submicroscobic heterozygous deletion including PIGG, GAK, FGFRL1, SPON2 genes on 4p16.3 was determined by MLPA me thod performed with P373 A1 MLPA probemix.The second patient is a 2 day old female patient. She has a dysmorphic face appearence, preauricular pit, PDA? and sacral dimple. She has a 46,XX,del(4)(p15.?3) karyotype. A 19 Mb heterozygous deletion between 4p16.3 4p15.3 regions was determined by arrayCGH [CytoScan750K_Array, Affymetrix] method. Deleted region includes 88 genes described in OMIM.Third patient is a 9 year old male who has microcephaly, dysmorphic face appearence, iris coloboma, exophtalmus, ASD+PDA+ pulmonary steno sis, gastroesophageal reflux, scoliosis and seizures. He has a 46,XY, der(4)t(4;18)(p16.3;p11.2) karyotype.Differential expressivity and incomplete penetrance in WHS cause difficul   ties in clinical diagnosis and problems in understanding the genotype/phe notype correlations.",2015.0,,"H.

We discovered that ASD genes were significantly lon ger, and less variable than non ASD genes (2684 vs. 1632 bp, and nucleoti   de diversity ÃÂ , 0.036 vs. ÃÂ , 0.046 respectively; P<0.001). The mutational dearth in ASD genes was particularly eminent when considering only SNVs with functional consequences, a possible effect of negative selection. Inte restingly, ASD genes also showed signs of positive selection, but these were less evident (P<0.09). We used these genomic characteristics to generate a multivariate model that classified ASD from non ASD genes with 72% ac curacy.

Some facial features are characteristic for the syndrome (i.e. round face, frontal bossing, arched eyebrows, deep set eyes, upslanted palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, thin upper lip, minor ear anomalies).

Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping by SNP/oligonucleotide mi  croarray (resolution: >1kbp) was used to analyze 300 children with ID, au   tism spectrum disorders and congenital malformations. Results. Cytogenetically visible 2q37 deletions were detected in 2 cases.  Molecular karyotyping confirmed the presence of these deletions (5Mb and 8.5Mb). Furthermore, a CNV within 2q37.3 (44kbp) leading to HDAC4 loss was detected in a patient. All affected female patients had ID, autism and  minor ear anomalies. One had widely set nipples and hypotonia. Another  one had a short statue. Two patients presented with ocular hypertelorism. HDAC4 haploinsufficiency was observed in all three cases. Conclusions.

611,686,"Efficacy of GenIDA, a family oriented international online registry and clinical database for genetic forms of intellectual disability and/or autism, to collect medically relevant information on the Koolen de Vries Syndrome",P08.52,,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are over   lapping disorders that constitute a major public health problem with a cu  mulated frequency of about 2.5%. Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen   tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members.Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen   de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy   potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website.This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare diseases affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

Mutation in KPTN gene have been identified as causative for autosomal re cessive mental retardation and clinically characterized by significantly be low average general intellectual functioning associated with impairments in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period. Most consistent features are global developmental delay, macrocephaly with frontal bossing, high levels of anxiety, repetitive speech, and mild to severe speech deficits. Recent repots suggest that KPTN mutations are associated with a broader phenotypic spectrum. We used next generation sequencing to find out disease causing gene confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

613,696, Mosaic Xq26,P08.64,,"Introduction. Recurrent mosaic duplications are exclusive in the available literature. This is especially the case in terms of clinically relevant X chro mosome duplications in females. However, a growing amount of reports on somatic genome variations causing intellectual disability and congenital malformations allows speculations that mosaic (sub)chromosomal rear rangements might be more common and clinically relevant than previously recognized.Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping using SNP/oligonucleotide microarray (resolution: >1 kbp) was performed in a cohort of 402 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformati ons.Results. Four girls (~1%) have exhibited mosaic duplications spanning Xq26.2q26.3.The age varied from 1 year 1 month to 6 years. Shared features included intellectual disability/developmental delay, microcephaly, broad phyltrum and wide nasal bridge, long lashes, ptosis; one patient demonstrated autistic features. The overlapping region for all duplications included 8 genes: GPC3,  MIR19B2 , MIR106A, PHF6, HPRT1, MIR503, MIR424, PLAC1. Although non  mosaic duplication in this region involving genes PHF6 and HPRT1 has been  described in the literature previously, the lack of phenotypic resemblance to the detected cases and an original bioinformatics analysis allow the specu lation that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 might be a new chromosomal syndrome associated with intellectual disability and congenital malforma tions.Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 are relatively common in children with intellectual disability, autism, epi lepsy and/or congenital malformations. Furthermore, our findings demon   strate the possibility that mosaic chromosomal rearrangements can be a cause for a new chromosomal syndrome.

615,704, Characterization of patient with de novo frameshift PUF60 mutation suggests that disruption of this gene is sufficient for most symptoms of Verheij syndrome,P08.72,,"Verheij syndrome (OMIM 615583) is associated with rare de novo 8q24.3  microdeletions. Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce   phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial   ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60  and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense  PUF60  mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked  coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60  and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced  different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome.We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty   ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four  nucleotides in PUF60  (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p.I136Tfs*31). The  patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome. The  case illustrates the strength of exome sequencing in deciphering the genetic basis of diseases.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.",2016.0,,"M.

618,709,Rubinstein Taybi syndrome type 2: Report of 9 new cases that extend the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum,P08.77,,"BACKGROUND: Rubinstein Taybi syndrome is an autosomal dominant  neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by growth deficiency, broad  thumbs and great toes, intellectual disability and characteristic craniofacial  appearance. Mutations in CREBBP account for around 55% of cases, with a further 8% attributed to the paralogous gene EP300. Comparatively few  reports exist describing the phenotype of Rubinstein Taybi due to EP300  mutations. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data were gathered from 9 pa tients from the UK and Ireland with pathogenic EP300 mutations, identified either by targeted testing or exome sequencing. RESULTS: All patients had  mild or moderate intellectual impairment. Behavioural or social difficul   ties were noted in eight, including three with autistic spectrum disorders.  Typical dysmorphic features of Rubinstein Taybi were only variably present.  Additional observations include maternal pre eclampsia (2/9), syndactyly  (3/9), delayed bone age (2/9), feeding or swallowing issues (2/9), scolio   sis (2/9) and hypermobility of the elbow (2/9). Six patients had truncating mutations in EP300, with pathogenic missense mutations identified in the remaining three. DISCUSSION: The findings support previous observations that microcephaly, maternal pre eclampsia, mild growth restriction and a mild to moderate intellectual disability are key pointers to the diagnosis of EP300 related Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Variability in the presence of typical facial features of Rubinstein Taybi further highlights clinical hetero geneity, particularly among patients identified by exome sequencing. Fea tures that overlap with Floating Harbor syndrome including craniofacial dysmorphism and delayed osseous maturation were observed in 3 patients. Previous reports have only described mutations predicted to cause haplo insufficiency of EP300. This cohort includes the first described pathogenic missense mutations in EP300.",2016.0,,"M. J.

621,742, Genomic and genetic variation at complex segmental duplications in Autism Spectrum disorders,P09.018,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most heri   table neurodevelopmental conditions but the aetiology remains elusive in a high proportion of cases. Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients  and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population.Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func  tional GTF2IRD2  genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls.  We also identified a disruptive mutation (p.M1?) in a GTF2IRD2  copy in two  affected brothers, inherited from their father. In the chr9 pericentromeric region, a de novo deletion was identified in a patient but the global distribu  tion of rearrangements and rare SNVs did not differ significantly between controls and patients.Conclusions: Despite their complex genetic architecture, our method suc cessfully identifies rearrangements and SNVs in SDs, such as copy gains and mutations at GTF2IRD2 or deletions of CNTNAP3 that could represent sus  ceptibility factors for ASD.Grant support: FISPI1302481/PI1300823/FEDER, 2014SGR1468 and FI DGR/2013.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  182Back to index",2016.0,,"M.

621,742, Genomic and genetic variation at complex segmental duplications in Autism Spectrum disorders,P09.018,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most heri   table neurodevelopmental conditions but the aetiology remains elusive in a high proportion of cases. Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients  and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population.Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func  tional GTF2IRD2  genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls.

Results: Savant skills were significantly more prevalent in our sample than in other children with ASD in the SSC cohort (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Child   ren with savant skills had, on average, a higher IQ (93.0ÃÂ±24.2 vs. 79.1ÃÂ±25.5; P<0.001), and a larger head circumference (HC) (54.3ÃÂ±2.55 vs. 53.8ÃÂ±2.60; P , 0.003). Interestingly, savant skills were associated with a lower count  of rare CNVs among children with ASD (14.0ÃÂ±5.54 vs. 14.8ÃÂ±6.2 for children  with and without savant skills respectively; P , 0.03). In addition, children with exceptional computational ability had lower burden of rare deletions compared to other children (203.46ÃÂ±164.25kb vs. 333.67ÃÂ±715.56kb; P ,  6.8x10 5) even after accounting for IQ and socioeconomic status. We also  examined whether certain talents are predisposed by specific ASD suscepti bility CNV loci, but no such associations were found.

The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication can be associated with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. The aim was to assess the neural networks involved in visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval in ASD due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication.Materials and methods: A woman with autistic features, macrocephaly and body asymmetry due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication and 7 healthy controls were investigated. Six runs of BOLD fMRI data were collected to assess the networks of the visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval; a single run of encoding task was followed by 10 minute retention period, then 2 runs of the retrieval tasks both for visual and verbal domain respectively. During encoding participants were instructed to memorize the task stimu li, whilst during retrieval they were instructed to decide whether the given image or word was presented during the encoding period. Data analysis was performed using the SPM8 toolbox under Matlab, with standard processing steps.Results: In patient fMRI for visual memory encoding/retrieval showed hig her activation in the posterior insulae, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared to the controls where visual areas were predominant in these tasks. Verbal memory activation was higher in the hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, precuneus; and lower in the anterior insulae; higher visual areas in our patient compared to the controls.Conclusion: The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication resulted in peculiar activity pat   tern of the brain responsible for visual and verbal memory in ASD.

637,795, Social anxiety and autism spectrum traits among adult FMR1 premutation carriers,P09.076,," Introduction: Behavioral symptoms and traits have been proposed as early markers in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim was of this study was to evaluate social anxiety and autism in FMR1 premutation carriers and con trols using the Social Phobia Inventory and the Autism Spectrum Quotient.Material and Methods: Fifty nine premutation carriers (40 females; 19 ma les) (7 females and 9 males with FXTAS) were compared to 50 controls (32 females; 18 males).Results: Our results show that FMR1 premutation carriers have higher so   cial anxiety scores and autistic traits compared to controls. Indeed, the SPIN scores were higher increased in women FMR1 premutation carriers compa red to men whereas the AQ scores were similar between the two genders. Finally, SPIN scores were correlated with the repeat size when the CGG num ber was greater than 100.Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that social anxiety is greater in FMR1 premutation carrier women than in controls but not in men. In addi   tion, both men and women with the FMR1 premutation have an increased risk of autism traits. Our results suggest that a wide range of behavioral/psychiatric traits should be included within the Fragile X Spectrum disorder and that the penetrance of these traits depends on the genetic background (CGG repeat number, gene modifiers, epigenetic, among others) as well as on gender.Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the Instituto de Salud Car   los III (ISCIII; PI12/00879), cofinanced by the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional Ã¢ÂÂuna manera de hacer EuropaÃ¢ÂÂ and AGAUR from the Autonomous Catalan Government (2014 SGR603).ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  195Back to index",2016.0,,"M.

It usually affects boys, but also there are girls affected. Duplication could be de novo or inherited from asymptomatic carrier mother. It has been reported about 120 cases all over the world, wi thout a known incidence.The aim of the study is to characterize a Spanish cohort with MECP2 dupli cation syndrome to improve our knowledge of the disease and perform a genotype phenotype correlation.Material and Method: The cohort consists in 13 patients of both sexes dia gnosed in different Spanish hospitals. The duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array. The clinical characterization was carried out using a checklist designed for the project. The molecular characterization is di vided into several steps: 1) Checking the duplication by qPCR doses, stu dy XCI and FISH; 2) If FISH shows tandem duplication, we narrowed the breakpoints through qPCR, PCR long and Sanger sequencing; 3) Analyze the expression of the two MeCP2 isoforms by RT qPCR.Results: In this collaborative study has been characterized a heterogeneous cohort, with both sexes, with different phenotypes (Rett like and duplicati   on patients) and inherited or de novo duplication located in different regi ons (tandem, other region of ChrX or ChrY).

651,1295, The use of automated facial analysis in the clinical diagnostic of autism spectrum disorders (ASD),P14.005,,"Introduction: Autism can be part of a genetic syndrome associating with dysmorphic features. While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts.

During pregnancy, a ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal  defect (ASD) and an omphalocele were diagnosed. At the time of presen   tation, he demonstrated global developmental delay and unspecific facial  dysmorphism. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed an apparently normal male karyotype (46,XY; GTG banding at 550 band level). Array CGH analysis (Agilent 400k microarray set) uncovered a de novo deletion of 1.6  Mb in the chromosomal region 5q35.1 q35.2. This deletion was confirmed  by FISH analysis. The deletion comprises 11 genes including the NKX2 5 gene (OMIM 600584). Mutations in the NKX2 5 gene were identified in patients with ASD, VSD, tetralogy of Fallot, and other congenital cardiac defects. The de   letion does not overlap with the minimal Sotos syndrome deletion region.To the best of our knowledge, there are only two reports on patients with small deletions in 5q35.1 q35.2 including the NKX2 5 gene. One patient was described with severe heart defect, microcephaly, minor facial dys morphic features, scoliosis, cryptorchidism, learning difficulties associated with ADHD and an IQ of 83.

Thirteen patients with de novo protein disrupting intrage  nic FOXP1 variants have been reported. They have language impairment,  developmental delay/intellectual disability (ID) and autistic features. We report an 8 year old boy with severe language impairment, moderate ID and atypical autism. His speech regressed at 18 months of age and started to improve again since 5 years of age. However, expressive speech is severely affected and shows no progress. The boy is hyperactive and anxious. Other features include hypotonia, mild facial dysmorphism, hypermetropia and strabismus.Karyotyping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Targeted next ge   neration sequencing using the TruSight Autism panel (Illumina) identified a private heterozygous nonsense FOXP1 mutation (NM_032682.5:c.1319C>G,p. S440*), which was confirmed using Sanger sequencing in the patient but in neither of his parents indicating its de novo nature. The aberrant transcript is likely removed by nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and FOXP1 haploin  sufficiency was proposed as the main pathogenic mechanism. If the tran script escaped NMD, the p.S440* mutation would truncate FOXP1 between the leucine zipper dimerization domain and the FOX DNA binding domain. A recently functionally characterized neighbouring FOXP1 variant p.Y439* showed aberrant protein localization.Our patient supports the role of FOXP1 in language, cognition and behaviour,  and helps to define the emerging characteristic somatic phenotype of FOXP1  mutation carriers which may include prominent forehead, frontal hair ups weep, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, low set ears, short nose with a broad tip and smooth philtrum.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.

In posterior pediatric revission was detected language and cognitive delayed, supected due to autistic disorder (AD), at 3 years age preseted epilepsy epi sodies. The familiar history include fater and maternal grandmother with epilepsy, maternal uncle with autism and a sister healty.Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH Array) with the Nimblegen CGX Cytogenetic Microarrays platform, suplied by PerkinElmer, was performed for the patient and parentsThe CGH  Array was normal in the father and both mother and patient presented a duplication of 5,56 Mb in 15q11.2 q13.1 PWS/AS region (arr(hg19)15q11.2 q13.1(22,822,019 28,379,369)x3). The Array CGH from grandmother, maternal uncle and sister were no done. This results are according with previous studies that show the correlation between this duplication and autistic disorder when have been maternal in origin.

679,2140, Genetic counselling in idiopathic autism: parental knowledge and perspectivesM,EMP1.22,," Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most inheritable neurodevelopmental disorders, but the aetiology remains unknown in 
the majority of cases. Therefore, most parents must base their reproductive 
decisions on empiric recurrence risk (RR) estimates. To determine factors 
influencing family planning and benefits of genetic counselling (GC), we studied knowledge and perceptions in parents with children with idiopathic 
ASD.
Materials and Methods: Parents with at least one child with ASD (n=39) answered a basal questionnaire addressing different topics, such as knowledge, 
perceived causes and RR or attitude towards genetics. A subset whose child had obtained negative results in molecular karyotype and exome sequencing (n=15) received GC and a following-up questionnaire afterwards and 
fifteen days later.
Results: Although most parents had received information about ASD, few 
had seen a medical geneticist or a genetic counsellor. Genetics was the most 
frequent perceived cause, especially among those with affected relatives. RR 
was overestimated by most parents and qualitative and quantitative estimates correlated. About half of parents believed that RR affected their family planning and their risk perception was higher compared to those who 
did not. After GC, quantitative but not qualitative RR estimates lowered and 
knowledge and favorable opinion towards genetics increased.
Conclusions: Although most parents perceived genetic factors as the most 
common cause of ASD, few had visited a genetics service. Perception of RR 
affects family planning and is overestimated by most parents. GC can improve knowledge and RR estimates and is key to take informed choices.

When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ï¬uence genetic risk. I.M.

TBL1XR1 mutations have been reported to be associated with autism, autosomal dominant mental retardation(OMIM: 616944) and Pierpont syndrome(OMIM: 602342). Only two cases with genedeletions have been reported: a single case with mild developmental delay(DD) and a 1.6 Mb de novo deletion at 3q26.31q26.32; and a familial case (mother/daughter) withmoderate intellectual disability(ID) and facial dysmorph  isms with a 708 kb deletion at 3q26.32. We report a 5Â½ year old male with global DD, growth retardation and dys morphisms with a 3q26.32 de novo deletion, being TBL1XR1 the only known coding gene within the deletion. TBL1XR1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed protein that localizes to the nucleus and plays a role in transcription mediated by nuclear receptors.

BDNF is indispensable for brain development. CADPS2 is maternally expressed in human blood and amygdala.Maternally inherited genetic variants of CADPS2 were suggested to contribute to intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), whereas paternallyinherited missense variants were not shown to have speci ï¬c phenotype. We report on two unrelated girls, in whom array CGH was performed due to ID and behavioral pro blems. Patient 1, a 13 year old girl showed a microdeletion of 79 kb in 7q31.32(12212618_122291639) (GRCh37/ hg19) encompassing four exons of CADPS2 . Her beha  vioral phenotype was characterized by anxiety. She showed mild dysmorphic features in terms of arched eyebrows and a prominent columella, the body measurements were normal.Patient 2, a 4 year old girl, had a microdeletion of 4.15 Mb in 7q31.31q31.32(118243718_122394183) (GRCh37/hg19) encompassing the whole CADPS2 gene. This patient showed behavioral problems consisting of impulsive dis  turbance with a tendency of self destruction.

Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ï¬rst line diag  nostic  and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22  and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con  ï¬rmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme  thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ï¬ed a thirdâmutation âinKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ï¬ndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

Nowakowska1 1Department of Medical Genetics, Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland,22) Department of Molecular & Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States,3Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are one of the most common groups of neurodevelopmental disorders with theprevalence of 1 â2%. Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of ASDs; it has been estimated that sub  microscopic copy number variants (CNVs) are the cause ofASDs in ~ 5 â13% of patients. We elected to use aCGH to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 178 patients with ASDs and toidentify novel ASDs genes. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using genome wide oligonucleo  tide microarrays (180k; Agilent Technology, OGT) with anaverage resolution of 30 kpz. We identi ï¬ed 25 CNVs in 21 out of 178 (11.8%) patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 12 (6.7%) patients, whereas CNVsof unknown clinical signi ï¬cance were found in 6.2% of patients with ASDs. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were sub  microscopic in size (between 75 kb and 4.54 Mb) and thuscould not have been detected by standard karyotype ana  lysis. Our study further con ï¬rmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by theidenti ï¬cation of two novel genes: ARHGAP24 and SLC16A7 as pathogenic for ASDs and three genes: SNX19 , PIGN andHCN1 as candidate for ASDs.

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities.Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro  mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol  vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ï¬rmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet. Five disease related genes arelocated in affected region and only haploinsuf ï¬ciency sen  sitive TBX6 has indirect effect on neural development. V. Å liuas: None. B. Aleksiuniene: None. E.

The deletion occurs near the end of the chromosome at a location designated q13.3.In addition to normal growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological de ï¬cits which include global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual impairment, absent or severely delayed speech, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Some people with this condition have autismor autistic like behavior that affects communication and social interaction, such as poor eye contact, sensitivity to touch, and aggressive behaviors. They may also chew onnon food items such as clothing. Less frequently, people with this condition have seizures. Patient 1: 9 year old girl patient Genetic Diseases Diagnosis referred to our center with autism like behaviors. The chromosome structure was determined as 46,XX. In the constructed arrayCGH analysis, 4315 kb deletion wasdetected in 22q13.31 q13.33 and 5057 kb duplication was detected in 8p23.3 p22.2 (Agilent 4x180K ISCA CGH +SNP).

It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep  set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC  related phenotype and its developmental tra  jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype  ï¬rst approach.

Obregia Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry, Bucharest, Romania,4Victor Babes National Institute of Pathology, Bucharest, Romania,5Titu Maiorescu University, Bucharest, Romania Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairment of social interaction,reduced communication skills and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The etiology of ASD is complex including genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. 2q13 dupli cation have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, ASD and dysmorphism. Several previous studies have linked the NPHP1 gene, located inthis genomic region, to ASD. In this paper we report a new case of 2q13 duplication in association with ASD and intellectual disability. The patient is a 5 years old boy bornat term from health, non consanguineous parents who was referred to the department of Child Psychiatry for speech delay and behavioral problems. Clinical evaluation revealeddysmorphic features (high forehead, large protruding ears, open held mouth), severe speech delay (he says only 6 simple words), moderate intellectual disability, autisticbehavior (no visual contact, dif ï¬cult social interaction, stereotypic movements). The genomic pro ï¬le obtained by array CGH (Agilent platforms) unveiled a 645 Kb dupli cation at 2q13 (110457697 111103309, hg18) encompass  ingRGPD6 ,MALL andNPHP1 genes. To date, 11 cases with 2q13 microduplication, including NPHP1 andMALL genes, have been reported. All patients presented behavior problems including ASD, attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder. Intellec tual disability was also noted in 8 patients. Other features described in some cases were speech delay and dysmorphic traits. All these ï¬ndings were found in our case, further contributing to the delineating of the 2q13 microduplication. I.O.

Here we report autistic behaviour patient with lack of speech and developmental delay that was referred for genetic testing. Both father andbrother of the proban are heterozygous carriers of beta  talasemia mutations. The patient was previously tested for Fragile X syndrome and X linked mental retardation relatedgenes were sequenced as well as whole exome sequencing was performed without detecting any relevant variants correlating with the clinical features. The only positiveresult was for HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genes predisposing to celiac disease. At the end aCGH array (180K) was per  formed and it detected 278kb duplicated region (11p14.3 /chr11: 22102205 22361578) that included the ANO5 and SLC17A6 genes. This duplication was interpreted as uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance based on the international recommendations. Second aCGH analysis with higher resolution (2,7M) was perform so we can gain additional information and eventually to clarify the previous ï¬nding. An additional duplication of 312 kb was detected in chro  mosome 15 (15q11.2), which included 4 genes: TUBGCP5 , CYFIP1 ,NIPA2 and NIPA1 (PMIDs: 28588435, 27566550). Duplication was inherited by the father who is without clinical manifestation. The 15q11.2 BP1 BP2 region is found duplicated or deleted in people with cog nitive, language, and behavioral impairmen and a variable phenotype so probably this ï¬nding is the leading cause for the clinical features in the affected child.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col  laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var  iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand  or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno  types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation.

It varies from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifesta tions and an increased risk of toxicity from 5  ï¬uorouracil treatment. Materials and Methods: A child with severe autistic behavior, intellectual disability (no speech at 6 years old) and family history   aunt with mental retardation, was referred for genetic counseling. Metabolic screening wasperformed in urine sample by dipstick   glucose, ketone, pH, and reducing sugars, followed by LC MS/MS blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines and GC/MS urine organicacids analysis. Mutations in DPYD gene are reported in DPD de ï¬ciency patients. The gene was investigated by direct Sanger sequencing in proband and his parents. Results: Elevated levels of thymine and uracil were detected by GC/MS urine test which was suggestive of DPD deï¬ciency.

Materials and Methods: In the context of an Interna  tional project aiming at identifying the genetic causes of ASD (Autism Sequencing Consortium, Mount Sinai), weperformed a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis in a cohort of 100 ASD patients, not harboring CNVs, attending the Medical Genetics Unit of Siena. Results: Mutations in already known ASD related genes were detected in 11% of cases, while either de novo or inherited mutations in novel genes were identi ï¬ed in 21% of cases.

The majority of reported patients harbored de novo loss of function (LoF) variants. To date, the phenotype of only four patients has been precisely described in the literature, contrasting with the relative frequency of detection of such LoF GATAD2B variants. Here, we describe 10 patients with con ï¬rmed LoF GATAD2B variants and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Methods: Patients were included by contacting referent clinicians from several French genetics departments. Results: Developmental delay was severe with a median age of 2.4 years (range [2 5]) for independent walking and of 2.75 years (range [1 4]) for ï¬rst spoken words. They showed very little subsequent progress, one patientremaining non verbal at age 30 years. ID was mostly moderate, with only one severe and one mild case, which differs from the original description of severe ID. Mostcommon dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, downturned mouth and, anomalies of the extremities. Conversely, prenatal compli cations, non cerebral organ malformations, epilepsy and autistic behaviour were very rare. One patient presented asthma and recurrent respiratory infections, another onepresented severe feeding dif ï¬culties and developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and IgG de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: NGS based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of GATAD2B variations. Better knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for a cor  rect interpretation of the molecular results and for anaccurate management of these patients. G. Vera: None. A. Sorlin: None. G.

764,451,A Autism monozygotic twins with APBA2 gene duplication vary for tick development,P09.018,,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is neurological and developmental disorder that begins earlyin childhood and lasts throughout a person's life, character  ized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and non verbal communication. Large genome rearrangements are being identi ï¬ed in ASD as an under  lying cause for development of this syndrome. These rearrangements are mostly deletions, but duplications canbe found. We present case of twin boys with APBA2 gene duplication. Materials and Methods: Twin boys, age 9 were referred to genetic counseling and testing with diagnosed ASD (DSM IV). DNA was isolated from buccal swabs of the boys, and 3 ml of whole blood from parents. Parents pro vided completed questionnaires for tick disorders in chil  dren as well as Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ). Identi ï¬cation of mutations was made with MLPA (multiplex ligase dependent probe ampli ï¬cation) technique, with MLPA kits P343 and P339 (Mrc Holland). Results: All samples were typed successfully. We iden  tiï¬ed de novo APBA2 gene duplication in both twins. This gene, located on 15q13.1 locus is already associated with autism features. DCDQ scores are similar in twins withindication of DCD. Assessment of the Questionnaires for tick disorders in children revealed that one sibling is com  pletely absent for ticks while other has high score for sec tion related to vocal and involuntary ticks.

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi  duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%). CYP2D6 metabo  lizes most psychoactive drugs, while CYP1A1 acts on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of endocrine disrupting chemi cals (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A). Early exposure to neurotoxic phthalates, bisphenol A and PAHs has been previously associated with ASD risk, and here we provideevidence for an effect of gene environmental exposure interaction mediated by CYP450 gene variants.

Nowakowska1 1Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland, 2MEDGEN, Warsaw, Poland Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a heterogenous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by problems in social interaction and communication as well as thepresence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviour. It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD. We elected to use oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 275 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high  resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non  polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k). Our study furtherconï¬rmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by the identi ï¬cation of two novel genes: LRRTM4 and DOCK1 as candidate for ASDs. B.

771,458,A Establishing genotype phenotype associations for ASD,P09.026,,"Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) has hindered the establishment of genotype phenotype associations. Herein, we presented a novel approach that integrates semantic similarity andunsupervised machine learning methods to dissect the ASD genotypic heterogeneity and to identify phenotypic mani  festations of ASD genetic variants. This approach wasapplied to copy number variants (N ,6650), disrupting 3998 genes from 1119 ASD patients. Functional similarities among genes were computed using Resnik semanticsimilarity measure. Semantic similarity score, ranging from 0 to 1 represents the functional similarity between two genes, where 1 represents identical genes while score 0reï¬ects functionally dissimilar genes. Agglomerative hier  archical clustering of the computed gene similarity matrix identi ï¬ed four different clusters of functionally related genes. Silhouette analysis indicated that clusters were compact and consistent (average Silhouette value ,0.31). The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations.

CNVs were called, validated, and subsequently ï¬ltered using established pipelines and detection algorithms (PennCNV, QuantiSNP, SnipPeep). Results: Fisher âs exact test reveal that CNVs encom  passed in core circadian clock genes, circadian pathway genes, and sleep trait candidate genes are signi ï¬cantly overrepresented in probands with ASD in comparison totheir unaffected siblings (p ,0.003; Odds ratio 1.6; CI95% [1.2 ; 2.3]). Conclusions: These preliminary results are the ï¬rst to implicate a broad network of sleep related genes in the etiology of ASD. Using whole exome sequencing (WES) data from the SSC, future investigations will evaluate therepresentation of probands âSNPs within sleep related genes in comparison to their unaffected siblings. Furthermore, SNP set Kernel Association Test (SKAT) using probands â WES and corresponding phenotypic sleep observations will identify candidate SNPs that associate signi ï¬cantly with disturbed sleep traits in individuals with ASD.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT  qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail  able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers.Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange  ment.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ï¬rst benchmarked our bioinfor  matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conï¬rmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub  stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ï¬rst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B.B.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti  mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

De novo missense variants in this gene have been linked to developmental disorders (DD) in a large scale study ofpatients with severe undiagnosed DD (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Only ï¬ve patients have been reported to date and clinical data remains very scarce. We report a new patientwith COL4A3BP  related intellectual disability (ID) aiming to contribute to the recognition of this condition. Materials and methods: Clinical data was collected from the patient âs medical records and compared with previous reports from scienti ï¬c literature and databases. Results: A 5 year old girl with unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery, presented with postnatal microcephaly, axial hypotonia, and severe global864 J. del Picchiadevelopmental delay. Short stature and facial dysmorphisms were noted and, at 24 months, she developed generalized seizures. Currently, she does not walk unaided, says only one word, and has poor visual contact and marked stereotypic behavior with bruxism. Whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a de novo pathogenic variant in COL4A3BP (S260L). Conclusions: This missense variant was previously found in 4 out of 5 known patients, suggesting a mutational hotspot in this gene. Former functional evidence indicates itresults in intracellular imbalances in ceramide, pivotal to the synthesis of sphingolipids. Our case has signi ï¬cant overlap with clinical data from previous patients.

Additional clinical fea  tures include dysmorphic features, obesity, musculoskeletal disorders (hypotonia, hypermobility, kyphoscoliosis) andbehavioural problems (autistic spectrum disorders) and afebrile seizures. The underlying cause of the syndrome is constitutive variants in the DNMT3 gene. We present an 11  old boy with recognized Tatton Brown Rahman syndrome and con ï¬rmed variant in the DNMT3 gene. Materials and methods: During molecular diagnostic procedure analysis of FMR1 gene for FRAXA syndrome and panel of 264 genes correlated with autism and mental retardation (NGS) were performed. Results: ForFMR1 gene expansion of CGG repeats was not identi ï¬ed. NGS analysis allowed identi ï¬cation of known heterozygotic variant p.Pro904Leu (c.2711C>T) intheDNMT3A . This variant is reported in dbSNP database (rs149095705) and ClinVar Database as likely pathogenic. Molecular analysis of p.Pro904Leu was also performed forproband âs mother and sister were mutation was not identi ï¬ed. Unfortunately the father âs material was not available for genetic analysis. There is high probability ofde novo character of identi ï¬ed variant. Conclusions: In the case of patients with intellectual disability and obesity, Tatton Brown Rahman syndromeshould be considered in the differential diagnosis. Studies using the NGS technique facilitate the diagnosis of patients with intellectual disabilities. I. Jaszczuk: None. I. Winkler: None. A. Sobczy Åska  Tomaszewska: None. M. Lejman: None. A.

In 10 patients pathogenic/ probably pathogenic mutations were discovered. We haveperformed comprehensive study of HLA gene variants discovered by NGS after lack of pathogenic mutations in patients affected by epilepsy with or without autism/mental retardation and compared with patients with other pathol  ogies (referred as controls). We focused on variants anno  tated as Variants of Unknown Signi ï¬cance (VUS). We determined the frequency of such variants in DRB1 and DRB5, in cases and controls, as they were the most com  monly found in both groups. The frequency varied between11 15% in cases and 11 23% in controls. In addition, we reported variants found only in cases(5 variants in DRB5 and 1 in DRB1), only in controls (7 in DRB5 and 10 inDRB1) and both in cases and controls (5 in DRB5 and 6 in DRB1).

813,255, Neurodevelopmental disorders and chromatin remodel ing dysregulation: the lessons from Kabuki syndromespectrum and clinical presentation of Tunisian cases,P11.056,,"Kaabi, W. Ltaif, S. Aloulou, S. Mallek, S. Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ï¬lled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen  tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ï¬nally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ï¬ve cardinal manifestations of KB deï¬ned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ï¬nitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ï¬rmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N.B. Abdelmoula: B.

The most frequent cause of mono  genic ID   the fragile X syndrome  is due to the absence of the RNA binding protein (RBP) FMRP. Many other IDgenes have been implicated in the RNA metabolism. NOVA2 is a RBP known to regulate neuron speci ï¬c alternative splicing (AS). We identi ï¬ed 6 individuals with de novo frameshift variants in NOVA2 affected with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by ID, motor and speech delay, autistic features, spasticity or ataxic gaitand abnormal brain MRI. All variants cluster in a small GC  repeat rich region, located in the last exon, indicating that the mutated transcript might escape to nonsense mediated decay. All 6 frameshift variants lead to the addition of a novel common C terminal part instead of the last KH RNA binding domain, suggesting a dominant negative mechan  ism. We detected 41 genes differentially spliced after downregulation of NOVA2 in human neuronal cells. TheNOVA2 variant protein shows decreased ability to bind target RNA sequences and to regulate target AS events. It also fails to complement the effect on neurite outgrowthinduced by NOVA2 downregulation in vitro and to rescue alterations of retinotectal axonal path ï¬nding induced by loss of NOVA2 ortholog in zebra ï¬sh. Our results showed that truncating mutations in NOVA2 cause a syndromic form of ID, suggesting a hypomorphic mechanism rather than a full heterozygous loss of function, although a speci ï¬c con  tribution of the novel C terminal extension cannot be excluded.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 33F.

Pre synaptic disorders, characterized bycongenital nystagmus and photophobia, night blindness, are known as cone rod synaptic disorder (CRSD) can be mis  taken for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Full  ï¬eld electroretinogram is crucial for the differential diagnosis, but it can be dif ï¬cult to perform in young children. Here, we report (i) the identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in the RIMS2 gene encoding a pre synaptic protein not yet asso  ciated with human diseases in 3/4 families initially referred for LCA and (ii) the diagnostic adjustment to CRSD withvariable associated alteration including autistic behavior and insulinopathy. Methods : Exome sequencing combined with targeted RIMS2 testing were performed in 46 prescreened patients with CRSD and 94 with LCA. Biallelic RIMS2 mutated cases underwent ophthalmologic, neurologic and metabolicassessment. RIMS2 immunostaining was performed on human retina, brain and pancreas. Nonsense variants were functionally investigated in mammalian cells. Results.Biallelic RIMS2 sequence variants were found in four unrelated families. RIMS2, a protein regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis localizes in the human retinal outerplexiform layer, Purkinje cells and pancreatic islets. Apart from CRSD, neurodevelopmental disease was observed in all cases, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in the eldestpatient.?Nonsense variants lead to truncated RIMS2 and decreased insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Conclusion : This is the ï¬rst report of syndromic CRSD with neurodevelopmental or pancreatic involvement due to RIMS2 loss of function.

Introduction: Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that can be isolatedor syndromic. Biallelic ALDH1A3 variants are responsible for 11% of recessive AM cases, mostly described in consanguineous families, and present severe bilateral AM with variable neurodevelopmen tal anomalies. We present six families with biallelic ALDH1A3 variants, further characterising the associated phenotype. Material and Methods: AM individuals from UK, France and Spain were analysed by WES, targeted gene screening and arrays. Results: We identi ï¬ed 6 families: Family 1) with two brothers with bilateral anophthalmia, one present additional developmen tal delay, absent speech and autism with compound heterozygousALDH1A3 variants (c.874G>T:p.(D292Y);c.1393A>T:p.(I465F)); 2) a boy with bilateral anophthalmia, developmental and intellectual delay, seizures and autistic features with compound heterozygous variants (c.845G>C:p.(G282A);c.1459A>G:p.(R487G)); 3) a girl withbilateral microphthalmia and coloboma with compound hetero zygous variants (c.847_849del;p.(G283del);c.953C>A,:p.(S318Y)); 4) a girl with bilateral anophthalmia with a homozygous missense variant (c.1144G>A:p.(G382R)); 5) a boy with bilateral microphthal mia, unilateral coloboma and cataract, with a homozygous splice variant (c.1233 +2T>C) and 6) a boy with bilateral microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, facial dysmorphism with ahomozygous missense variant (c.434C>T:p.A145V). Conclusions: Three of the six families presented with com pound heterozygous variants, highlighting this mode of inheri tance in ALDH1A3 related disorders. Five of 6 families had a variant in the catalytic domain, supporting the importance of this domain,which is critical for substrate selectivity. Severe neurodevelop mental phenotypes were present in two individuals, and variably penetrant in family 1, supporting that this can be an importantfeature of the ALDH1A3 syndrome.",2021.0,,Y.

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families.

We performed deep sequencing of mtDNA, de ï¬ning haplogroups and evaluating private variants, including those at low heteroplasmy. An independent cohort of 127 Italian families was used as a replica. Both these cohorts were compared to a controlgroup of 5088 healthy individuals. MtDNA content was assessed inblood cells. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate risk factors inï¬uencing ASD severity classi ï¬ed by the calibrated severity score of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Results: Haplogroup H in probands resulted protective for ASD, counterbalanced by increased risk conferred by haplogroups L and I. Paternal haplogroups U5a and K increased the risk ofdeveloping ASD in offspring. Probands showed increased numberof missense mutations in MT ATP6 and MT ATP8 and reduced mtDNA content. Paternal super haplogroups H and JT are associated with mild phenotypes, whereas variants with 15% 5%heteroplasmy are associated with severe phenotypes. Conclusions: Our results indicate a contribution of mtDNA to ASD susceptibility and phenotypic expression.

Introduction: Helsmoortel van der Aa syndrome, or Intellectual Disability Autosomal Dominant 28 (MDR28, OMIM 61 5873) is a rare neurodevelopmental genetic disorder affecting about 1 9/100 000 individuals (0.17% of patients with i ntellectual disability and autism). The broad and variable spectrum of clinical manifestations includesglobal developmental delay, autistic features and neuropsychiatric or behavioral issues, seizures and distinct dysmorphic facial features. We report a case of a nine month old girl with delayed motordevelopment (delays in sitting and holding head up), general hypotonia, dysmorphic facial featur es (prominent forehead, discrete strabismus) and noticeable happy demeanor. Materials and Methods: The initial metabolic screen and array CGH results were normal and the additional genetic testing included an NGS gene panel of 37 spinal muscular atrophy associated genes (AARS1, ASAH1, ASCC1, ATP7A, BICD2, BSCL2,CHCHD10, DCTN1, DNAJB2, DYNC1H1, EMILIN1, EXOSC3, EXOSC8,FBXO38, GARS1, HEXA, HSPB1, HSPB3, HSPB8, IGHMBP2, LAS1L, PLEKHG5, RBM7, REEP1, SCO2, SETX, SIGMAR1, SLC25A21, SLC5A7, SPTAN1, SYT2, TRIP4, TRPV4, UBA1, VAPB, VRK1, WARS1) includingADNP using Illumina NGS platform, SMN1/SMN2 deletion/duplica tion by MLPA and AR repeat by PCR analysis.

The variant is predicted to create a premature stopcodon and protein truncation and results in a loss of function ofADNP, affecting chromatin packing and transcription.

This has signi ï¬cant implications for recurrence risk in future pregnancies, and therefore must be given due consideration when analysing next generation sequencing (NGS) data. Automated trio analysis pipelines ï¬ltering for de novo variants may discard these variants as inherited, depending on their parameters. A secondary analysis comparing VAF in the proband and apparently unaffected parents can be used to identify theseinherited âde novo âvariants in clinically relevant genes. Using this approach, we have detected a mosaic TGFBR2 variant (VAF of 20%) in a clinically unaffected individual with multiple children with Marfan syndrome. It has also lead to the identi ï¬cation of a heterozygous HECW2 variant in a patient with intellectual disability and severe autistic features. The patient âs clinically unaffected father was mosaic for this change (VAF of 30%). Additional challenges surrounding the identi ï¬cation of mosai cism in NGS data include determining the clinical signi ï¬cance of variants detected with a low VAF in affected probands, and analysis of appropriate tissue types in cases of suspected somaticmosaicism.L.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes. Collectively, the cross disorder rCNV maps and metrics derived here set the foundation for future studies of dosage sensitivity throughout the human genome.",2021.0,,R.L. Collins: None. J.T.

During development, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are born in the nasal placode and migrate to the hypothalamus, where they position to regulate sexual reproduc tion. Defective GnRH neuron development may lead to GnRH deï¬ciency (GD) which is characterized by absent or delayed puberty. Several GD causative genes have been identi ï¬ed so far, but half of the cases are still idiopathic. The employment ofcomplementary research approaches may be useful to identify additional genes implicated in GD pathogenesis. Here we combined for the ï¬rst time in the ï¬eld the transcriptomic analysis of GnRH neurons with exome sequencing data from GD patientsto identify novel candidate genes. As a proof of principle, we identi ï¬ed a pathogenic variant in the autism linked Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3 ) gene in a patient with severe delayed puberty and autistic traits. We demonstrated that NLGN3 is enriched in GnRH neurons at late developmental stages. Further we found that NLGN3 overexpression in an immature model of immortalizedGnRH neurons promoted neurite extension whereas the novelNLGN3 mutation formed a truncated protein, thus supporting its pathogenic potential. Overall, our results highlighted how the combination of gene expression and exome sequencing data is areliable approach to identify novel candidate gene for GD such aNLGN3, an autism linked gene that we found for the ï¬rst time associated to GD.",2021.0,,R.
