Itis characterised by difficulties in social interaction and stereotyped behav iour but in contrast to infantile autism by normal intelligence and usuallynormal language skills. In the pediatric age group the prevalence ofAsperger syndrome is around 4 7/1000 whereas the corresponding figurefor the infantile autism is 4/10000. Etiopathogenesis is unknown but thereis evidence for a strong genetic component. Based on clinical observationsAS is inherited in the same families as infantile autism but also as a sepa rate entity often transmitted from male to male. We report the analysis of13 candidate gene loci associated with autism and schizophrenia in 17Finnish AS families with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Linkageto the previously reported predisposing loci for autism could not be repli cated with Finnish AS families. By contrast  evidence for linkage wasobtained on 1q21 22 the region that has previously been linked to schizo phrenia (Brzustowicz et al.  2000) with the maximum two point lod score of2.70 with marker D1S484. Two families shared a common haplotype with in an 8.6 cM region between markers D1S2721 and D1S484.

Besides those  4 individuals presented no PDD and 3 individualshad infantile psychosis. These data suggest that  in at least 15% of thissample  a main etiologic factor could be identified. Although the diagnosisof a specific genetic condition do not modify the treatment of autistic indi viduals in most cases  it is of significant importance to the genetic coun seling of their relatives. For this reason  we reinforce the importance ofcareful dysmorphologic examination and complementary tests in any per son presenting with PDD  besides neurologic and psychiatric evaluation. ,2001.0,dgmfcm@unicamp.br,,,In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with  PDD a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation screening for inborn errors of metabolism karyotypein folic acid deficient medium and molecular test for the  FRAXA mutation.,,autistic behavior

Brondum NielsenJohn F. Kennedy Institute  Glostrup  D,The subtelomeric regions are often involved in chromosomal rearrange 172 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyments. They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients  all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism  andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found  A 1pter deletion  resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR  growth retardation  and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR  epilepsy microcephaly  and dysmorphism  consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR  microcephaly  an atrial septum defect  and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients.In conclusion three out of 41 (7.3%) patients with idiopathic MR were foundto have subtelomeric rearrangements  in concordance with the prevalence(5 10%) in previous studies. ,2001.0,els@kennedy.dk,,,Two groups of patients all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism andwith at least one other relative affected with autism.,patient with autism,

Even before the causative gene for this syndrome was identified  pedigree studies indicated that it was likely to be an X linked dominantdisorder  with presumed lethality in males. Nonetheless  there were a fewdescriptions of males suspected of having Rett syndrome. These includesporadic cases meeting the clinical inclusion criteria  sporadic males withKlinefelter syndrome (47 XXY)  and males with severe neonatalencephalopathy in known Rett syndrome families. With the recent discov ery that the MECP2 gene on Xq28 is the gene responsible for most casesof Rett syndrome  it is possible to molecularly assess cases suspected ofhaving male Rett syndrome by direct sequencing analysis. We describethe first 4 cases of molecularly confirmed cases of Rett syndrome in Israel.One of the families presented here consists of a female having classicalRett syndrome and a male sibling with severe neonatal encephalopathy.Molecular analysis revealed that both sister and brother have the sameMECP2 gene mutation  however their mother does not  suggestinggermline mosaicism. The case emphasizes the point that maternalgermline mosaicism may lead to affected female or male offspring  whichshould be taken into consideration during genetic counseling regardingrecurrence risks  and suggests that prenatal diagnosis may be warrantedin siblings of apparently sporadic cases of Rett syndrome. It also highlightsthe importance of molecular diagnosis in every case of idiopathic neonatalencephalopathy in males. ,2001.0,aviorr@tasmc.health.gov.il,,,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized bycognitive and adaptive regression with autistic features loss of acquiredskills like speech and hand usage stereotypic hand movements epilepsy ataxia and deceleration of head growth that almost exclusively affectsfemales.,regression with autistic,autistic feature

W ieacker Institute for Human Genetics  Otto von Guericke University  Magdeburg G, magdeburg.deThe candidate tumor suppressor gene DICE1 is located within a previous ly reported LOH critical region telomeric to the RB1 gene in chromosomalregion 13q14.3. Intron/exon mapping of the DICE1 gene revealed 18exons that are preceded by a GC rich promoter. The DICE1 mRNA isexpressed in a variety of normal tissues and it is downregulated in tumorcells suggesting tumor specific inactivation of DICE1 by gene silencing. Inadult brain an alternatively spliced DICE1 transcript (ASP1) has been iden tified that appears to be differentially expressed. In the variant DICE1 tran script ASP1 exon 3 is spliced out which results in a DICE1 protein lackinga potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site. In order to determineexpression of the DICE1 mRNAs in different brain regions RT PCR basedexpression profiling of a regional brain panel was performed. Expressionof DICE1 was observed in frontal and temporal lobe  cerebellum  substan tia nigra  caudate nucleus  thalamus  hypothalamus  pons  medulla andspinal cord but not in hippocampus and amygdala. The ASP1 transcriptappears to be expressed predominantly in substantia nigra.

In contrast  inmouse fibroblasts  the maternally derived inactive allele is less acetylatedthan the paternally derived active allele at all tested loci  with the moststriking difference detected at the CpG island of Snurf Snrpn. These find ings suggest that 1) histone acetylation may not strictly correlate with the DNA methylation status at each imprinted locus  and 2) chromatin structureof the imprinted domain may vary between mouse fibroblasts and humanlymphoblasts. ,2001.0,tatesmakmak@med.hokudai.ac.jp,,,Lym phoblastoid cells from  PWS and  AS patients and controls as well asfibroblasts from  PWS and  AS model mice carrying a 4 Mb deletion andcontrol mice were used.,,AS patient

Gallati3 1Children s University Hospital  Berne  Switzerland  2Children s University Hospital  Department of metabolic disease  Berne  Switzerland  3Chil  dren s U niversity Hospital  Human Molecular Genetics  Berne  Switzerland ,Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive diseasecaused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme Arylsulfatase A (ASA).Depending on whether the mutations in the ASA gene cause complete oronly partial loss of enzyme activity age of onset and the course of the dis ease vary. MLD is lethal and no specific treatment can be offered topatients. Genetic counseling and the offer of prenatal diagnosis are there fore a need. They are complicated by the great variety of different muta tions occuring in the ASA gene. The aim of this study is to identify diseasecausing ASA mutations and to study their nature and distribution in ourpatient population. Mutation screening was started in a group of 50 MLDpatients. Fifty healthy individuals serve as controls. Preliminary results  apartial screening of the ASA gene using SSCP and sequencing lead to theidentification of 24 mutant alleles carrying 20 different mutations  9 ofwhich were novel. 85% of mutations found were nucleotide substitutions(missense/nonsense)  10% splice site mutations and 5% small deletions.This corresponds well to the distribution found among known ASA muta tions.

Clas sical RS features seem to occur almost exclusively in females  with an esti mated prevalence of one in 10 000 15 000 female birth. The vast majori ties of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin  and are due to de novomutations. Mutations in the Methyl CpG Binding protein 2 gene have been identified in roughly 75 % of classical Rett girls. We collected DNA samplesfrom 42 Italian classical Rett girls  and screened the MECP2 coding regionfor mutations by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography(DHPLC)  and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently devel oped method for mutation screening combining high sensitivity  reducedcost per run and high throughput. In our study  16 different de novoMECP2 mutations  seven of which were previously unreported  were foundin 32/42 Rett girls (76%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized ina total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identifi cation of 14/16 different mutations (87%)  after optimal conditions wereestablished  this figure increased to 100%  with all recurrent MECP2 muta tions generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Standardizationof DHPLC reagents and methods seems to be critical to the reliability andaccuracy of mutation prediction. Detailed analysis of signature shape retention time  and retention time differences between peaks will allow sig nature based sequence identification  at least for the most commonMECP2 mutations and SNPs. ,2001.0,talycarella@tigem.it,,,Rett  syndrome is an  X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disordercharacterized by several clinical abnormalities such as progressiveencephalopathy autistic behavior and stereotyped hand movements.,,autistic behavior

Eighteen patients originated from former Czechoslovakia  sixwere from Netherlands. Niemann Pick disease type A and B is an autoso mal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal ASM (E.C.3.1.4.12) and the resultant lysosomal sphingomyelin accumulation. Thereare 21 ASM gene mutations published up to date.

Restag  noMolecular Genetics Laboratory  Children s Hospital Regina Margherita Torino  I,Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndromes (AS) are caused by the lossof function of imprinted genes in proximal 15q. The PWS and AS imprint ing mutations  include the DMR (Regions of allele specific DifferentialMethylation) at the CpG islands of the SNRPN locus which may lead toincorrect resetting of the imprint in the germ line. We are using M PCR(Methylation specific PCR) which can rapidly assess the methylation sta tus of CpG sites within a CpG island  without using methylation sensitiverestriction enzymes. This assay entails initial modification of DNA by sodi um bisulfite  converting only unmethylated cytosines to uracils and subse quent amplification with primers specifically designed for the methylated orunmethylated version of the CpG island of SNRPN. A retrospective studyconducted on 42 DNA samples previously analyzed by Southern blottingshowed 100% concordance on 15 PWS  4 AS and 23 normal samples. Adiagnostic test is now routinely performed on DNAs from various sources(blood  Guthrie cards  CVS). In the last year we analyzed 65 subjects withsuspected PWS/AS  nine showed the methylation pattern of PWS  two themethylation pattern of AS and fifthy four were normal. M PCR is a reliablemethod in the differential diagnosis of neonatal hypotonias and of the var ious forms of obesity/hypotonia/mental retardation. The advantage of M PCR  when compared with previous PCR based techniques or Southernblot are the rapidity  sensitivity  the use of cheap reagents and the possi bility of detecting the major classes of molecular defects causing PWS/AS(deletions  uniparental disomy and imprinting mutations) without the needof parental DNA. ,2001.0,talygrestagno@hotmail.com,,,The  PWS and  AS imprint ing mutations include the  DMR (Regions of allele specific  Differential Methylation) at the  CpG islands of the  SNRPN locus which may lead toincorrect resetting of the imprint in the germ line.,,AS imprint

The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line.

It is caused by muta tions in the FGD1 gene located in Xp11.21. Since many X linked mentalretardation (XLMR) conditions localize to a broad region encompassingXp11.2  we began a mutational analysis of XLMR families linked to Xp11.2as well as males from small  unstudied XLMR families. In one affectedmale in the families  a shift in exon 4 of FGD1 was detected by SSCP.Sequence analysis revealed a C1665T change  which gave rise to anamino acid substitution  P312L. The base change was confirmed by StyIdigestion of the altered allele. Analysis of the family indicated the C1665Talteration segregated with XLMR in the family. The C1665T alteration wasnot detected in 250 normal X chromosomes. The phenotype of the affect ed males is non syndromic.

141,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test  and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and  analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose.  Control hybridizations with normal male to male, male to female and  female to female reference samples were performed and showed  the expected results.

142,131,Association between TNFR2 and familial but not  sporadic rheumatoid arthritis provides evidence for  genetic heterogeneity.,P0036.,,"Background. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), involved in  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) binds TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors.  Genome scans have suggested the TNFR2 locus as a candidate RA  locus. A case control study in a UK Caucasian population has shown  an association between a TNFR2 genotype (196R/R in exon 6) and  familial, but not sporadic RA. Objective. To test this association in the  French Caucasian population. Methods. To test for an association in sporadic RA, 100 families were  genotyped for the 196M/R polymorphism and analysed using the  transmission disequilibrium test and the haplotype relative risk (HRR).  To test for an association in familial RA, RA index cases from affected  sib pair (ASP) families (n = 100) were genotyped for 196M/R. Linkage  analysis was performed with 3 TNFR2 microsatellite markers. Results. The TNFR2 196R/R genotype was not associated with  sporadic RA (P= 0.72), but with familial RA (P= 0.026). The  association was most marked in the context of TNFR2 Ã¢ÂÂtwin likeÃ¢ÂÂ  RA sibs (affected sibs sharing both TNFR2 haplotype) (P= 0.0017).  Linkage analysis was consistent with the association, the subgroup of  families with 196R/R ASP index cases provided most of the TNFR2  linkage evidence. Conclusion. This study represents the first replication of the  involvement of TNFR2 in RA genetic heterogeneity. Our data refine  the initial hypothesis, to suggest that a TNFR2 recessive factor, in  linkage disequilibrium with the 196R allele, plays a major role in a  subset of families with multiple RA cases.",2002.0,,"Dieude1, E.

Methods:  Clinical Posters   Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 114 115 manifestation, family data, history of pregnancy, parental age and  anthropometric traits were analysed and compared in two groups of  patients with deletion and mUPD. Cytogenetic analysis was routinely  performed using HRBT in all patients. FISH was done in all cases  which were diagnosed in our genetic unit. Methylation analysis, gene  dosage analysis for SNRPN and polymorphism analysis for loci  within the PWS/AS region are included in our molecular diagnostic  procedure. Results: PWS diagnosis was confirmed by methylation  test in 77 (38%) patients. Among them deletion was detected in 40  (25%) patients, mUPD in 11 (14,2%) and imprinting mutation in 1  (1.3%) patient. Detection of the molecular defect was impossible in  6 (7,8%) patients because of uninformative polymorphism analysis  results. For 19 patients the procedure for the purpose of molecular  defect detection is in progress. Detailed comparison of phenotype  and anthropometric evaluation will be presented in the group of  deletion and non deletion patients. Discussion: Our results of  clinical and molecular investigations are comparable with those from  published analyses.

We are presenting the results of our studies in a serie of 64 female  cases in which we looked for mutations in the MECP2 gene.

In the first group, 21 mutations were identified ; in the second, 8  mutations and zero in the third group. These results confirm that the  vast majority of mutations in the MECP2 gene lead to a classical Rett  syndrome phenotype. They also show that a large proportion of girls  with a severe mental handicap are not found to be associated with a  MECP2 mutation on the contrary to what was recently proposed in  the litterature. In addition, we did not find any genotype phenotype correlations for  the Rett syndrome patients taking into account the mutation type, the  functional domain affected by the mutation and the X chromosome  inactivation status of these patients except for the mutation involving  the C terminal domain associated with a ÃÂ« forme frustre ÃÂ» of the  disease.

In this study, we investigated 33 patients from 25  families with a definite clinical diagnosis of AS and we evaluated 4  methods to establish a mutation screening strategy for the UBE3A   gene. Automated SSCP analysis was used to screen the UBE3A  gene for point mutations in all patients, in combination with direct  sequencing if mutation could not be detected. Since the majority of  UBE3A identified mutations are truncating mutations, we developed  the protein truncation test (PTT) as a possible alternative approach  to rapidly detect such inactivating alterations in this large gene.

Method: Parents of 21 children with BBS seen for a multidisciplinary clinical  assessment completed standardised measures of behaviour. Results: Children with BBS showed elevated levels of internalising problems  including feeling withdrawn and anxious/depressed. They also had  elevated levels of social, thought and attention problems. A significant  minority scored in the clinical range on a measure of autistic  symptoms, although none met clinical diagnostic criteria. The children  also had elevated scores on a measure of repetitive behaviour and  the majority was reported to be obsessive by their parents.

This leads to a  human brain that is three times greater in size. Perturbations of this  process result in congenital microcephaly. We have studied a cohort  of 57 consanguineous Northern Pakistani families with the clinical  diagnosis of Ã¢ÂÂautosomal recessive primary microcephalyÃ¢ÂÂ (MCPH)  and now report our clinical and molecular findings. Affected individuals have a head circumference of < 4SD and mild/ moderate mental retardation, but no other abnormal findings. MRI  scans show a general reduction of brain size but particularly of the  cerebral cortex. Using autozygosity mapping we have found 7 MCPH loci. Genotyping  of all families against all loci showed that MCPH5 is the common  locus accounting for 27/57 families. We identified the ASPM gene (the orthologue to the drosophila  abnormal spindle protein which is involved in neuroblast asymmetric  cell division ) at the MCPH5 locus using a common haplotype and  positional cloning approach. All mutations identified to date cause  premature truncation of the 3442 amino acid protein. We are currently  investigating the function of ASPM in humans.

Microsatellite analysis in the proband showed biparental  inheritance of markers located within and outside of the AS/PWS  critical region.

In addition, we visited all Estonian institutions  for disabled children. The selection of investigated patients based on  the consensus diagnostic criteria for PWS described by Williams et al  (1995), and for AS by Holm et al (1993). The DNA methylation test was carried out in 45 patients with  suspicion of PWS and in 73 patients with suspicion of AS, this test  was positive in 6 and 3 patients, respectively. Patients with positive  test results and previously diagnosed patients were analysed by FISH  and chromosomal analysis. From 8 identified PWS patients 4 had a  deletion in the region 15q11 13, one had a translocation 15;15 and 3  had a matUPD15. From 5 AS patients 4 had a deletion and 1 had a  patUPD15. Two patients with AS were included into study based on  clinical picture only. The preliminary prevalence of PWS and AS in Estonia was estimated  as 1:40000 and 1:46000, respectively.

The investigations undertaken have also been scrutinised  to see which are giving a high diagnostic yield. The overall rate for establishibg a firm diagnosis was 29% with an  additional 12% of patients having tentative or partial diagnoses being  made. It is not suprising that a genetics department is not diagnosing  Downs syndrome, but perhaps unexpected that there is only one  case of a microdeletion syndrome in the list of patient diagnoses. Analysis of features evident from initial history of examination  that predict an aetiology being established show the presence of  dysmorphic features and a milder level of delay to be the only factors  with positive predictive value. The presence of autistic features,  positive neurology (inc. microcephaly, macrocephaly, epilepsy) other  system anomalies (eg cardiac etc)were all found not to have any  predictive value in whether or not a firm diagnosis would be made.

239,705,Mutations In The Col4a4 Gene In Relation To  Familial Hematuria,P615.,,"Mutations in COL4A4 gene have been reported in autosomal  recesive and dominant type of Alport syndrome (AS), as well as  benign familial hematuria (BHF) or thin basement membrane disease  (TBMD). BHF probably affects at least 1% of the population and  is characterized by persistent microscopic glomerular hematuria,  sometimes with proteinuria or hypertension, thinning of the  glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and normal renal function.  Considering the similarities in GBM abnormalities, TBMD cannot be  clinically differentiated from the initial stages of AS. It has recently  been suggested that TBMD represents a carrier state of autosomal  recessive or X linked AS. We analyzed 22 patients with confirmed  BHF and 12 AS patients who had tested negative in COL4A5 gene  screening also for COL4A4 mutations. Non isotopic single stranded  conformation analysis (SSCA) after amplification of each exon with  boundary intronic sequences by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  was used for all 51 exons of COL4A5 and 47 exons of COL4A4  gene. While no mutation was identified in COL4A5 gene in all 34  patients COL4A4 mutation screening disclosed eleven common  polymorphisms that are shared in part with other populations and  six novel mutations: G774R (GGT>CGT), G789G (GGA>GGT),  2860+2T>G, R908W (CGG>GGG), D1049H (GAC>CAC)+del 5 bp,  3506 8T>G and 4081 8G>C comprising three missense mutations,  one frameshift and two potentially splice site mutations. Furthermore,  we found one silent mutation, one rare variant in a non coding region,  and several polymorphism with a very low heterozygosity.

250,971,The angiotensin I converting enzyme gene  polymorphism and AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease,P885.,,"Introduction:  Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive  neurodegenerative disorder characterized by irreversible cognitive  and physical deterioration. The levels of angiotensin I converting  enzyme (ACE) in brain influence cognitive processing acquisition  and recall of newly learned tasks in animal. The insertion/deletion  (I/D) polymorphism influence the variation of ACE level in plasma and  brain. In previous studies this polymorphism was associated with AD,  but the results were controversial maybe due to ethnic background.  Aim of the study : To investigate the possible association between  I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene and AD in Serbian population.  Methods: The study sample consisted of 160 persons: 30 late  onset AD patients (85.50 ÃÂ± 5.47 years old), 30 healthy age matched  non AD controls ( 84.22 ÃÂ± 3.99 years old) and 100 healthy young  controls (33.8 ÃÂ± 8.9). The diagnosis of AD was made according to  the NINCDS ADRDA criteria. Genotyping for I/D was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a modified three primer  method. Results: Frequencies for II, ID and DD ACE genotypes  in AD patients were 21.43 %, 57.14 %, 21.43 % respectively and  I/D allele frequencies were 0.5/0.5. No significant difference in  distribution of ACE genotypes between AD patients and healthy age  matched controls or young controls was found. Conclusion: Further Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics254 255 study with larger number of AD patients could suggest that the ACE  I/D gene polymorphism may constitute a genetic susceptibility factor  for dementia in Serbian population. P886  Association of lipoprotein lipase gene Asn291Ser  DNA polymorphism with plasma lipid levels   S. Glisic , A. Stankovic, M. Zivkovic, T. Djuric, D. Alavantic;  Ã¢ÂÂVincaÃ¢ÂÂ Institute of Nuclear Sciences, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.   Introduction : The enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has a central  role in lipid metabolism. LPL hydrolyses triglyceride (TG) rich  core of circulating chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins.  Asn291Ser substitution is located in the N terminal end and may  influence the catalytic activity of LPL. It was recently reported that this  polymorphism was associated with Alzheimer disease, increased risk  of pre eclampsia and ischemic heart disease. The aim : of this study  was to determine genotype and allele frequencies of Asn291Ser  polymorphism in 193 healthy and unrelated subjects from Serbia.  Relationship between this polymorphism and plasma lipid levels  was investigated in our healthy population as a base for future  studies on different groups of patients. Methods : Genomic DNA  was extracted from whole blood by proteinase K/phenol method.  LPL genetic variants were detected by ASA method combined  with semi nested PCR. Results : Frequencies of Asn291Ser and  Asn291Asn genotypes were 1% and 99%, respectively and Ser291/ Asn291 allele frequencies were 0.05/0.95. Variation of lipid levels  among individuals with different LPL genotype were not statistically  significant. We detected a trend of increase in triglyceride levels  and both, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in carriers of the  291Ser allele. Conclusions : Genotype and allele frequencies in our  population are consistent with other Caucasian populations. Data  from our study could be important for further research of pathological  states considering lipid metabolism.",2003.0,,"Djuric1, A. Stankovic1, M. Zivkovic1, S. Glisic1, D. Pavlovic2, D.

MPS VI (Maroteaux Lamy syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disease  caused by insufÃ¯Â¬Âcient activity of the enzyme N acetylgalactosamine  4 sulfatase (arylsulfatase B or ASB). The clinical course is chronic, progressive, and life threatening. Results are reported here for a multicenter, multinational, open label extension of the Phase 3 study of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using weekly treatment of 1 mg/kg recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB). Nineteen patients in each of the rhASB and placebo groups completing the 24 week placebo controlled study were enrolled. The primary objective was to evaluate rhASBÃ¢ÂÂs ability to enhance endurance based on an increase in the number of meters (m) walked in a 12 MinuteWalk at Week 48 compared to baseline (Week 0) and with entry into the extension study (Week 24). As a reference, the rhASB group improved by a mean distance of 109 m relative to 26 m for the placebo during the double blind phase (p=0.025). From Week 24 to Week 48, the original placebo group received rhASB and showed a mean increase of 65 m relative to Week 24 values (p=0.007), and an increase of 90 m relative to baseline for the entire 48 weeks (p<0.001). From Week 24 to Week 48, the original rhASB group improved their mean walk distance an additional 36 m (p = 0.15) for a total of 145 m relative to baseline (p=0.001). Similar changes were observed for each group in a 3 Minute Stair Climb, a secondary endpoint variable, providing additional evidence of improved endurance.

Several dismorphic facial features were noted: caratacts of both eyes, cleft upper right lip and complete cleft of the palate. Heart ultrasound showed ASD secundum. Brain US and CT showed periventricular hypoxia with cystic leucomalatia. Genetic counselling in such a family can be difÃ¯Â¬Âcult. As both parents in the present case had normal karyotypes, the risk seems to be extremely small but it can also be further minimized if the next pregnancy is properly supervised.

265,232,Hyperphosphatasia with cognitive deÃ¯Â¬Âcit and seizures:  further syndrome delineation,P0115.,,"Hyperphosphatasia is a persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase activity seen in many disorders, particularly those affecting bone turnover. There have been occasional reports of hyperphosphatasia associated with progressive postnatal neurodevelopmental disease and seizures (MIM#239300). Affected children exhibit consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) of uncertain origin. There are no other laboratory Ã¯Â¬Ândings of note and no evidence of any abnormality of bone or liver metabolism, or altered skeletal architecture. Affected siblings and/or consanguinity suggest autosomal recessive inheritance, but the underlying pathogenesis is  unknown.We describe a new case and review the clinical features in the context of 16 previously reported children. Our proband is a 5ÃÂ½ yr old girl born to consanguineous parents, who presented with marked developmental delay and dysmorphic features (brachycephaly, coarse facies, hypertelorism, bulbous nose with prominent nasal bridge, and downturned corners of the mouth) at Ã¯Â¬Âve months of age. Subsequently, failure to thrive, acquired microcephaly, and autistic behaviours were observed. Seizures and an abnormal EEG were also seen. The hyperphosphatasia (867ÃÂ±72 IU/L, n=7) is associated with decreased pyridoxal 5Ã¢ÂÂ phosphate (B 6), and the question of aberrant vitamin  B6 metabolism has been raised in this condition before. Pyridoxine  challenge (100 mg bolus) resulted in normalized EEG activity. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs tonic clonic and absence seizures have not been evident since phenobarbital withdrawal and treatment with 100 mg pyridoxine daily. Our case illustrates two points: 1) alkaline phosphatase should be assayed in children presenting with similar Ã¯Â¬Ândings; 2) pyridoxine EEG challenge should be attempted to determine whether other affected children show pyridoxine responsiveness.",2005.0,,"M.

KBG syndrome is a rare, but underestimated, autosomal dominant disease (40 cases described), characterized by macro oligodontia, short stature, mild to medium mental retardation, skeletal defects and other clinical features. We report 7 sporadic cases, 3 M and 4 F, observed during adolescence.This period is characterized by the modiÃ¯Â¬Âcation of previous relationships, that leads, to a possible change in the role and importance of the family and reference Ã¯Â¬Âgures.The child grows and Ã¢ÂÂthe chrysalis becomes butterÃ¯Â¬ÂyÃ¢ÂÂ. The process seems complicated and difÃ¯Â¬Âcult in KBG patient. He links superÃ¯Â¬Âcially to other persons. His world remains limited to a biunivocal relation with the mother, that lasts longer than the other children, so remaining in a condition of passivity and greatest dependence. He understands he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt overtake the daily problems without help. He reacts isolating from the real life, taking refuge in a fantastic world. He closes himself in a autistic passivity as the only answer to his own inadequacy. The world outside seems to him full of hostility.More than ten years ago we chose, in favour of patients with genetic syndromes, a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a clinical genetist. Therapeutical results have been  satisfactory in KBG patients.We noted: acceptance of their own body, more optimistic approach to life, improvement of school and working integration, higher control of  nutritional and drug addiction.This experience improved our life and our profession, allowing a deep and empathyc interaction between patient and physician, that  represents the true essence of every medical act.",2005.0,,"Biondi , D.

One of the genes associated with CHD is the  NKX2 5 gene, which encodes a  cardiac homeobox transcription factor. Mutations of NKX2 5, which  is located at 5q35.1 have been identiÃ¯Â¬Âed in a subset of familial and sporadic cases of atrioventricular (AV) conduction block associated with a spectrum of structural heart defects, including atrial septal defect (ASD) and tetratology of Fallot. Functional studies of  NKX2  5 mutations have indicated that haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency determines the AV conduction block and ASD phenotypes. However, some studies suggest dominant negative effects and it has not been possible to correlate other  NKX2 5 phenotypes with a speciÃ¯Â¬Âc mechanism of the  mutation due to a small sample size.Here, we present delineation of a microdeletion in a patient with AV conduction block, ASD and tricuspid valve malformation (Ebstein anomaly) in addition to microcephaly, scoliosis and pectoral hypoplasia. FISH mapping of an apparently balanced inversion, 46, XY, inv(5)(q13q35) de novo, revealed a 2.2 megabase deletion  at the distal inversion breakpoint. This region contains 17 RefSeq genes, including  NKX2 5. This case gives therefore strong evidence  for haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency of NKX2 5 as the cause of Ebstein anomaly.

Furthermore subtelomeric 2q37.3 deletions are often detected with FISH subtelomeric screening and most of those 2qtel deletions are considered polymorphisms as they are also observed in the parents. However some of them are de novo terminal deletions associated with an abnormal phenotype. We collected 14 observations from 10 new families through the A.C.L.F.

Canavan disease (OMIM 271900) is an autosomal recessive spongy degeneration of the central nervous system and usually has fatal prognosis in 1 to 3 years. The disease is caused by deÃ¯Â¬Âciency of the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) (EC 3.5.1.15) and characterised by increased levels of N acetylaspartic acid (NAA), a possibly neurotoxic compound, in body Ã¯Â¬Âuids. The human aspartoacylase gene is located on chromosome 17p13ter and contains 6 exons, which encodes a  protein of 313 amino acids.Two unrelated patients have been diagnosed in Slovakia last year. Patient 1 a third child in family presented psychomotor retardation, hypertonic syndrome and leukodystrophy at 4 months of age. Patient 2 a Ã¯Â¬Ârst child of non consanguineous parents presented macrocephaly, spastic quadruparesis, amaurosis, seizures and leukodystrophy at 1 year of age. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses of organic acids in urine revealed high excretion of NAA in both cases.To elucidate the cause of disease at molecular level we analysed the ASPA gene by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products of all 6 exons from genomic DNA of patient 1. We have found homozygous missense point mutation 914 C>A in exon 6 changing alanine 305 to glutamic acid (A305E), which is the most common mutation among European patients of non Jewish origin and leads to complete loss of ASPA enzyme activity. Both parents were found heterozygous for A305E. The molecular genetic analysis of patient 2 has revealed heterozygous state for A305E mutation.

Canavan disease (OMIM 271900) is an autosomal recessive spongy degeneration of the central nervous system and usually has fatal prognosis in 1 to 3 years. The disease is caused by deÃ¯Â¬Âciency of the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) (EC 3.5.1.15) and characterised by increased levels of N acetylaspartic acid (NAA), a possibly neurotoxic compound, in body Ã¯Â¬Âuids. The human aspartoacylase gene is located on chromosome 17p13ter and contains 6 exons, which encodes a  protein of 313 amino acids.Two unrelated patients have been diagnosed in Slovakia last year. Patient 1 a third child in family presented psychomotor retardation, hypertonic syndrome and leukodystrophy at 4 months of age. Patient 2 a Ã¯Â¬Ârst child of non consanguineous parents presented macrocephaly, spastic quadruparesis, amaurosis, seizures and leukodystrophy at 1 year of age. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses of organic acids in urine revealed high excretion of NAA in both cases.To elucidate the cause of disease at molecular level we analysed the ASPA gene by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products of all 6 exons from genomic DNA of patient 1. We have found homozygous missense point mutation 914 C>A in exon 6 changing alanine 305 to glutamic acid (A305E), which is the most common mutation among European patients of non Jewish origin and leads to complete loss of ASPA enzyme activity. Both parents were found heterozygous for A305E. The molecular genetic analysis of patient 2 has revealed heterozygous state for A305E mutation. The search for  the second pathologic mutation is still in progress.",2005.0,,"Futas1, R. PetroviÃÂ1, D. KantarskÃÂ¡2, M. KolnÃÂ­kovÃÂ¡3, J.

A total of 52 patients presenting with clinical manifestations of MLD were studied using quantitative determination of leucocytic ASA, inorganic sulfates and sialic acid, their ages ranged between 1.5  4 yrs.

In the case group, 24 (68.6%) individuals exhibited wild type E selectin 128S genotype, 7 (20%) were heterozygous S128R and 4 (11.2%) were homozygous for the 128R allele. In the control group, the distribution was 26 (65%) homozygous 128S, 13 (32.5%) heterozygous S128R and 1 (2.5%)  homozygous 128R.The distribution of the E selectin genotype in our control group showed Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, which veriÃ¯Â¬Âed that the control group was statistically appropriate, and that the genotyping protocol was error  free.The genotype distribution in the AS group was statistically signiÃ¯Â¬Âcant different (ÃÂ 2=5.74) from the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Disease association with S128R was assessed by single locus and single locus allele based ÃÂ 2 tests for a 3x2, respectively 2x2 contingency  table, to compare each genotype/allele frequency in patients with AS versus control individuals. No signiÃ¯Â¬Âcant association was found in  either situation.The Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium observed in AS group could be produced by random sampling errors due to small population size (estimated frequency of AS in general Caucasian population is 0.1  0.2%).",2005.0,,"Popa1, R.

ASD of the secundum type is characterised by an incomplete coverage of the ostium secundum resulting in a left to right shunting. The effects of the ASD range from subclinical to severe symptoms including pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias and heart failure. ASD is mostly sporadic but several familial cases have been reported. We describe two extended Swedish families with isolated autosomal dominant ASD. Using polymorphic microsatellite markers, we performed a genome wide scan in search for chromosomal regions linked to ASD. Linkage to the previously described candidate loci including the  COMP and GATA4 genes were excluded for the two  families. We identiÃ¯Â¬Âed a 23 cM region on chromosome 15 (15p11 q13) which is linked to the disease phenotype. The region is restricted by recombination events between the markers D15S165 and D15S659 and we calculated a maximum cumulative LOD score for the two families of 3.6 assuming full penetrance.

331,1338,BARCODE: a new software for comparative dating of  haplotypic nested lineages,P1225.,,"We present a new software for comparative dating estimates of haplotypic lineages deÃ¯Â¬Âned by Unique Event Polymorphisms (UEP), on the basis of linked STR diversity. BARCODE (Basic ASD Regression for COmparative Dating Estimates), applies a comparative dating approach free of assumptions on STR mutation rates to detect the linear accumulation of ASD over time. Its power relies on the exploitation of the UEP deÃ¯Â¬Âned phylogeny, which provides a unique solution for the order of nodes in the tree to be analysed. The set of possible solutions to be tested for ASD TIME linearity is created through an algorithm speciÃ¯Â¬Âcally created. The more the phylogeny has a nested shape, the more the dating result is robust. BARCODE allows to weight each lineage according to its frequency in the dataset, a fundamental option Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology348 when the sampled lineages include variants supposed to be ancestral  to a demographic expansion or when dealing with data unbalanced in  sample size.We report the results obtained by running BARCODE on published Y chromosomal data sets. The relative dating estimates are in general agreement with the absolute estimates originally published. The results also allow inferences on STR mutation rates (ASD TIME regression slopes): some critical loci emerged, which show variable mutation patterns across the data sets. However, most STR loci show a similar behaviour across the data sets, thus conÃ¯Â¬Ârming their informativeness. The most commonly used STR loci can then be ranked in different classes, according to their mutation rates, independently on the  particular data set considered.Work supported by PRIN MIUR 2003.",2005.0,,"Luca1, M.

Microsatellite analysis in patient No 1 showed  a combination of maternal iso and hetero disomy of chromosome  15 while in patient No 2 the coexistence of heterodisomy or normal biallelic inheritance along with isodisomy is noted . The coexistence of uniparental maternal iso  and heterodisomy could  be explained by a recombination event before the 1st meiotic division  followed by non disjunction during the 2nd division and loss of the  paternal homologue due to trisomy rescue . The influence of complex rearrangements of chromosome 15 on the phenotype, when imprinted genes are included, is of great interest . Such cases are rare in the literature .

419,1234,Evaluation of ms mLPA for molecular diagnosis of  Prader Willi and Angelman syndrome in a clinical context,P1218.,,"Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) are distinct syndromes  characterized by developmental impairment, caused by loss of  expression of imprinted genes in the paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) chromosomal region 15q11 q13 . Molecular genetic testing is important  to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to predict the familial recurrence  risk which depends on the underlying molecular mechanism [deletion  (in 75% of PWS and AS cases), uniparental disomy (UPD), an imprinting error or point mutations] . In most diagnostic laboratories methylation specific PCR or Southern blot analysis is used . Additional testing (FISH, UPD analysis) is required to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism . An ideal molecular test  should provide information about both parent specific methylation imprinting on 15q11 q13 and the underlying genetic mechanism .  Recently, methylation specific multiplex ligation dependent probe  amplification (MS MLPA) became commercially available. This  technique allows detection of changes in CpG methylation and copy number of chromosomal sequences in a single reaction . We evaluated this technique for diagnostic applications in a clinical setting . Using MS MLPA we tested a group of 16 patients with  previously confirmed PWS (7) and AS (9) respectively. The molecular  diagnosis and underlying molecular mechanism were confirmed in all cases . A comparison was made between MS MLPA and Southern blot results . We conclude that MS MLPA is a powerful technique, suitable for molecular diagnostics of PWS/AS in a clinical context .  MS MLPA has important advantages compared to other techniques  as starting from genomic DNA, information about methylation status  and underlying molecular mechanism is provided within in a single experiment, resulting in a shorter turnover time .",2006.0,,"Claes , K.

Among the three genes of the minimal critical region (from  centromere to telomere: SHANK3 , ACR  and RABL2B ), SHANK3  is  considered to be at the origin of the neurobehavioral symptoms. We report a child with a de novo  interstitial 22q13.3 deletion detected  by MLPA and confirmed by FISH. She demonstrates mental retardation, severe speech delay, epicanthic  fold, and protruding ears with normal growth. This non specific pheno   type is concordant with the classical presentation of 22q13.3 deletion  syndrome. Subtelomeres analysis by MLPA showed a discrepancy between the  P036B and P070 kits (MCR Holland): P070 MLPA probe (targeting  ARSA  gene) showed a deletion but P036B (targeting RABL2B  gene)  showed a normal result. FISH analysis using LSI TUPLE1 /LSI ARSA   (Vysis) probes confirmed deletion of ARSA , whereas FISH with N25/ N85A3 (Cytocell) probes, targeting SHANK3  locus was normal. This  was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR of exons 23 and 24 of  SHANK3 . Supplemented FISH analysis using BAC clones were per   formed to delineate both breakpoint regions of the interstitial deletion. These data highlight the difficulty of performing an appropriate test in  order to search for cryptic 22q13.3 deletion.

472,603,The single cell as a tool for genetic testing: credibility  and precision,P0467.,,"Specimen for prenatal testing: chorionic villus sampling or amniocen   tesis are obtained during pregnancy thus the diagnosis of an affected  embryo usually leads to pregnancy termination. Pre implantation ge   netic diagnosis (PGD) is a procedure which involves the biopsy and  testing of one cell following in vitro fertilization and the implantation of  unaffected embryos. The process minimizes pregnancy terminations  in case of at risk couples. The minute initial amount of DNA (single genome) generates technical  difficulties such as amplification failure and allele dropout (ADO). Our  objective was to measure and quantify those aspects of the single cells  analysis. The study was carried out in single peripheral lymphocytes  and embryonic culture cells.

ADO rate however was significantly lower in embryonic single cells  compared to lymphocytes (average of 4.5 fold). We hypothesize that  dividing cells demonstrate lower ADO rate due to their less compact  nucleus structure. To test the hypothesis, lymphocytes were induced  to divide by PHA and single cells were tested for ADO rate.

BCR ABL fusion  gene encodes cytoplasmic BCR ABL oncoprotein with a constitutive  tyrosine kinase activity that enhances the proliferation of affected cell  clone. Selective inhibitor of BCR ABL tyrosine kinase namely imatinib  mesylate (Gleevec, STI571) is used as an effective therapeutic agent.  imatinib induces the BCR ABL protein into the inactive conformation  by binding to amino acids in the ABL kinase domain and blocks the  binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This prevents the transfer  of phosphate from ATP and blocks the downstream signal pathways,  leading to growth arrest or apoptosis. Targeted therapy with imatinib  has led to revolution in the treatment of CML. However, some patients  develope resistance to imatinib. Point mutations in the ABL kinase do   main is the major mechanism of resistance in patients treated with  imatinib and these missense mutations cause different degrees of  resistance.

Most deletions are similar in  size (approximate 4 Mb) and occur de novo through maternal unequal Molecular and biochemical basis of disease1 crossing over between low copy repeats (LCRs). Paternal occurrence  of similar deletions, instead, results in Prader Willi syndrome (PWS,  OMIM#176270).

491,972,PLP1 overexpression in PMD and PMLD patients: interest  of fibroblasts analysis,P0839.,,"The myelin proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1), which encodes for the main  proteins of the CNS myelin, is implicated in the X linked disorders of  CNS myelination, Pelizaeus Merzbacher Disease (PMD) and Spastic  Paraplegia 2 (SPG2). Large duplications including the whole gene ac   count for 60% of gene alterations. Transgenic mice with additional Plp  gene copies are identically hypomyelinated and have demonstrated  that Plp overexpression may act in a dominant negative effect on my   elinating oligodendrocytes that enter into apoptosis. By real time quantitative RT PCR, we quantified PLP/DM20 mRNA  levels in nerve biopsies (n=6) and primary cultured fibroblasts (n=14),  from PMD patients carrying a PLP1 gene duplication. An overexpres   sion of the PLP/DM20 transcripts was observed in all samples com   pared to controls, suggesting that PLP1 expression in fibroblasts and  in PNS may reflect PLP1 expression level in the CNS. Therefore, fi   broblasts from 17 male PMD/SPG2 patients without identified PLP1  or GJA12 abnormality (PMD Like, PMLD), were analyzed. Among  them, 8 present with a PLP/DM20 mRNAs overexpression, implicat   ing a PLP1 dysregulation due to mechanism(s) alternative to the gene  duplication. All have a mild form of dysmyelination.

493,985,Mutations in the MECP2 gene in patients of Slavonic  origin with Rett syndrome,P0852.,,"Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder  affecting almost exclusively females. It has an incidence of 1:10,000  female births and is characterized by apparently normal development  for the first 6 18 months of life followed by the loss of acquired motor  and language skills, autistic features, and development of stereotypic  hand movements. Rett syndrome is caused primarily by de novo mu   tations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Methyl  CpG binding protein 2 plays important roles in the regulation of gene  expression and RNA splicing. Here we report the mutational analysis  of the MECP2 gene in 95 patients from the Czech and Slovak Repub   lics and the Ukraine with classical Rett syndrome. The patients, all  girls, were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing of the entire  coding sequence and the exon/intron boundaries of the MECP2 gene.  RFLP analysis was performed to confirm the mutations that cause the  creation or abolition of the restriction site. Mutation negative cases  were subsequently examined by multiple ligation dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) to identify large deletions. Sequencing analysis  revealed 33 different mutations in 74 patients, and MLPA analysis re   vealed large deletions in two patients. The detection rate was 78%.  One mutation in exon 1 (c.48_55del8) has not been published yet.

494,1016,Determination of the pathogenicity of USH2A and MYO7A  genes variations.,P0883.,,"Abnormalities of pre mRNA splicing are increasingly recognized as an  important mechanism through which gene mutations cause disease. It  has been shown that intronic or exonic enhancer (ISE/ESE) or silencer  (ISS/ESS) cis regulatory elements are required for splice site (ss) rec   ognition. Consequently, nonsense, missense and even silent mutations  could be a novel form of splicing mutations. Numerous intronic and ex   onic variations for which the pathogenic effect is not well established  were found in the MYO7A  and USH2A  genes responsible for Usher  syndrome. In this study, the putative effect on splicing of some of these  variations was determined. As specific transcripts analysis was not  possible in these patients, we use a splicing reporter minigene system.  We first concentrated on intronic variations localized inside or outside  the canonical splice sites. Several mutations revealed a splicing altera   tion. For instance, a mutation localized in position  14 and predicted to  create a novel 3Ã¢ÂÂss, was found to activate a downstream exonic cryptic  splice site. Another one, localized in position +3 and not predicted to  alter the splicing by in silico  tools, induces an exon skipping. Secondly,  we evaluated the effect of missense or silent mutations predicted to  alter ESE sequences, in particular SF2/ASF sites, by measuring the  ability of these predicted ESE to rescue splicing of an enhancer de   pendent exon using a fluorescent reporter minigene. These results are  of great help to assess the pathogenicity of unclassified variants and  will also contribute to a better understanding of the splicing regulatory  mechanisms in genes involved in Usher syndrome.",2007.0,,"Le GuÃÂ©dard1, O.

Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a complex neurobehavioral disorder as   sociated with loss of function of differentially expressed imprinted gene  at the region 15q11 q13. It is a rare disorder. It occurs in one of 20  000 live births. It is due either to a microdeletion in the 15q11 locus  (65 75%), or to uniparental disomy (5%), or to UBE3a gene mutations  (10%), or to an anomaly of printing center (5%). In the 10% remainders  cases, the cause still unknown. The molecular study of the patients appear with a great importance  with an aim of being able to conclude about the parental origin and,  therefore, about the disease. In this work, we developed an experimental protocol able to ensure  the molecular detection of this pathology. It is based on the MS MLPA  technique (Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe  Amplification), which is able to detect abnormal methylation of imprint   ed genes as well as deletion occurring at 15q11 q13 locus. The study  of STRs markers of chromosome 15 allowed us to distinguish between  uniparental disomy and microdeletion when abnormal methylation was  detected. These two complementary techniques allowed us to study 8 suspected  AS patients. Only one of them showed a deletion in the 15q11 q13  region. This anomaly was confirmed with FISH (Fluorescent In Situ  Hybridysation). The combination of these two techniques, in the diagnosis of AS,  represents a very good strategy to find more than 85% of causative  anomalies.

We collected 153 documents, from 77 European and international in  stitutions, national health associations, regulating and research fund   ing agencies, professional organizations, civic and ethics bodies, phar   maceutical and insurance industry. Definitions ranged from being strictly synonymous to DNA based test   ing, to any source that can provide unambiguous genetic information.  They may or not bridge different applications, contexts, mutations and  material analysed. Pharmacogenetics, somatic mutations, population  screening, or even carrier testing and caryotyping were included only  sometimes; while non medical or research applications, identity testing  and sources other than genetic material (other tests, physical exam,  family history) are seldom covered. Some trends could be found when  comparing different professional organizations or among countries  and cultures (geneticists vs. pathologists, insurers vs. human rights  and patient interest groups, ethical bodies vs. commercial labs, Eu   rope vs. USA). E.g., the ASHG definition covers only tests in DNA and  specific gene products, while the ESHG includes also caryotyping and  all sources of genetic information.

After a period of normal  development usually until 6 18 months of age, affected girls enter a  period of regression, losing speech and motor skills, coincident with  the onset of hand stereotypies, leading to loss of purposeful hand use, which is the hallmark of the disorder  . MECP2 gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and is subject to X in   activation. Gene mutations are identifiable in 80% of classic Rett syn   drome, but less frequently in atypical RTT  .

First, the analysis of methylation status was performed with MS PCR  method using primers specific for SNRPN  locus  .

557,438,Laboratory progress in molecular diagnosis of Prader Willi  syndrome and Angelman syndrome   A new strategy by  methylation specific competitive multiplex PCR,P02.056,,"Introduction: Most of the Prader Willi syndrome and Angelman syn   drome patients are caused by the deletion of chromosomal 15q11 13 or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 . There are many diagnostic  tools available like the FISH analysis, methylation based PCR, multi   plex PCR, High Resolution Melting analysis and commercialized MS MLPA . Each of them has some disadvantages and limitations such as  high costs, time consuming and requiring DNA bisulfite treatment. We  introduce a novel, in house designed methylation specific competitive  multiplex PCR, which takes three hours for the reaction, avoids bisul   fite treatment of DNA and provides reliable results of PWS and AS. Material and methods: 68 patients with clinical suspicion of PWS, two  with AS, and 20 unaffected individuals from the general population  were analyzed. In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, we amplified  one SNRPN control gene, the KRITI gene to serve as internal control,  and the promoter of the SNRPN gene, which could be digested them with HhaI enzyme . By comparing the copy number of the three re   gions, we could differentiate the wild type, deletion type and UPD type PWS within one reaction . We also evaluated other different diagnostic technologies in clinical applications . Results: In this article, we successfully made the molecular diagno   sis of one AS patients and 46 PWS patients by several different tech   niques . In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, the total copy numbers were accurately calculated in all of the cases . Conclusions: The MS competitive multiplex PCR strategy is a good al   ternative for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS . This approach could  serve as an alternative genotyping platform for epigenetics .",2008.0,,"S. Y. Lin , C. H. Lin, Y. N.

The usage of probes  specific for 15q11 q13 locus  makes it useful as a diagnostic tool in the  diagnosis of Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) . The  aim of our study was the implementation of MS MLPA technique as a standard diagnostic procedure in PWS/AS patients . The Salsa MS MLPA Prader Willi / Angelman Kit (ME028) was used according to MRC HOLLAND suggested protocol . The MS MLPA peak  analysis, normalization and calculation of dosage ratio were performed with the SoftGenetics LLC GeneMarker ver 1 .6 software . For the pilot  study, we have chosen 20 cases with established PWS or AS mo   lecular diagnosis based on PCR based DNA methylation analysis of  SNRPN  locus  (MS PCR) and the STR analysis of deletion or UPD  presence . The results of the analysis of the copy number variation and the meth   ylation status in 15q11 q13 locus  with MS MLPA confirmed the previ   ous findings obtained for the pilot patients. We have also performed  the copy number variation analysis in additional 16 AS and 24 PWS patients with abnormal methylation status detected by MS PCR .

Karyotype analysis revealed  a de novo apparently balanced translocation t(6;14)(q16;q22) . Whole  genome array CGH analysis with ~385,000 oligonucleotide probes  (NimbleGen) identified an ~1.48 Mb deletion in 6q16.1. FISH with  BAC clones mapping within and directly flanking the deleted segment  showed that the deletion arose at the translocation breakpoint .

585,786,Residual disease monitoring in chronic myelogenous  leukaemia (CML) using tricolour dual fusion fluoresence in situ   hybridisation (FisH) probe system,P04.088,,"Objectives: We investigate the application of the BCR ABL  + 9q34 tri  colour dual fusion translocation probe system (Vysis) for the monitor   ing of residual disease in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) with  der(9) deletion through analysis of both interphase and metaphase FISH signal patterns . Methods: BCR ABL  dual colour dual fusion FISH (D FISH) was per   formed on the diagnostic samples of 22 CML patients . The tri colour  system was tested on cases that showed aberrant signal patterns oth   er than the classical 1G1O2F. Using the aqua band pass filter, random  signal overlap would be indicated by the presence of an aqua signal  (ASS) in the Ã¢ÂÂfusionÃ¢ÂÂ signal, while genuine fusion was represented by  the absence of the ASS signal . Results: Using the D FISH system, the signal patterns could be cat   egorized into 4 groups: group 1 (n , 17) showed the classical 1G1O2F;  group 2 (n , 2) showed 2G1O1F indicating ABL deletion; group 3 (n  , 1) showed 1G2O1F indicating BCR  deletion; group 4 (n , 2) with  1G1O1F indicating reciprocal ABL BCR  deletion . The tri colour dual  fusion system showed excellent correlation with D FISH for cases with der(9) deletion . In particular, the added aqua  ASS probe allowed the  discrimination of random signal overlap from genuine BCR/ABL  fusion  in the interphase cells (group 4) . Conclusion: Although the D FISH probe remains valuable in establish   ing the different patterns of aberrant signals and monitoring patients  with the classic 2 fusion signals in CML, the tri colour dual fusion  translocation probe should be used for patients with der(9) deletion to monitor response to treatment .",2008.0,,"L.

Genetic polymorphisms  in codons 10 of the TGF ÃÂ²1 gene have been shown to be associated  with the production of high or low TGF ÃÂ²1 levels. The role of this poly   morphism in development of prostate cancer and hyperplasia was in   vestigated . Material and Methods:Using ASO PCR method, association between  the T (Leu) to C (Pro) polymorphism at codon10 of the TGF ÃÂ1 gene  (TGFB1) and the risk of PCa or BPH in 100 controls were deter   mined . Results: Significant differences in the CC versus TT genotype distribu   tion between PCa patients and male controls (P , 0 .009), and between BPH patients and male controls (P , 0 .005) were noticed . Males with  the TT genotype had a 1.67 fold increased risk of PCa [95% confi   dence interval (95% CI) , 1 .49 1 .87, P , 0 .009] and TC /TT genotype,  1.14 fold increased risk of PCa [95% confidence interval (95% CI) , 1 .02 1 .26, P , 0 .047] and a 1 .54 fold increased risk of BPH with the TT genotype (95% CI , 0 .98 1 .14, P , 0 .005) and 1 .06 fold increased risk of BPH with the TT/TC genotype (95% CI , 0 .98 1 .14, P , 0 .061)  compared with those with the CC genotype respectively  . Conclusion: Based on our findings, it was possible to conclude that the  codon10 polymorphism in TGFB1 may have a significant influence on  the development of PCa and BPH and the T allele of TGFB1gene has  the dominant effect on development of PCa and BPH .",2008.0,,"M.

605,1155,the BDNF receptor gene NTRK  is a susceptibility gene for  autism,P06.034,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely determined by multiple genes . The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant  transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns  5 6  and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) . Given this evidence for association, we  genotyped these markers in a second population sample of 168 Irish trios . In the combined sample (N,491) we found an association of the  same three SNPs at a more stringent P level (0 .006<P<0 .015), and  found nominal associations with four additional markers in intron  22  23 (0 .0211< P<0.043). Previously we have described a significant in   crease of plasma BDNF levels in approximately 30% of our patients .  We therefore screened NTRK2 exons  encoding ligand binding and  catalytic regions ( exons  6, 7, 12, 18, 20 24) for mutations in 20 autis   tic individuals with increased BDNF levels and 10 controls . No muta   tions were identified in these individuals, and there was no evidence  for association of NTRK2 with plasma BDNF distribution .

605,1155,the BDNF receptor gene NTRK  is a susceptibility gene for  autism,P06.034,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely determined by multiple genes . The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant  transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns  5 6  and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) . Given this evidence for association, we  genotyped these markers in a second population sample of 168 Irish trios . In the combined sample (N,491) we found an association of the  same three SNPs at a more stringent P level (0 .006<P<0 .015), and  found nominal associations with four additional markers in intron  22  23 (0 .0211< P<0.043). Previously we have described a significant in   crease of plasma BDNF levels in approximately 30% of our patients .  We therefore screened NTRK2 exons  encoding ligand binding and  catalytic regions ( exons  6, 7, 12, 18, 20 24) for mutations in 20 autis   tic individuals with increased BDNF levels and 10 controls . No muta   tions were identified in these individuals, and there was no evidence  for association of NTRK2 with plasma BDNF distribution .

In particular, the 15q13.3 microdeletion has been identi   fied in 0.2 0.3% of individuals with mental retardation and epilepsy,  schizophrenia, autism and other neuropsychiatric features. The criti   cal region between BP4 and BP5 contains at least seven genes, in   cluding CHRNA7 , which is considered a good candidate gene for the  epilepsy phenotype. We report a series of 11 patients (8 index cases  and 3 affected parents) presenting a developmental delay and a 1.5  Mb 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion ascertained through 11 French  CGH array platforms. All 8 index cases presented mild to moderate  mental retardation with absent or non specific dysmorphic features.  Only two had seizures, 4 had an abnormal electroencephalogram and  none had an autistic behaviour. One patient presented a highly differ   ent phenotype, including hydrocephaly, joint dislocations, congenital  lymphoedema and notable dysmorphic features associated to men   tal retardation. Familial studies could be performed in 5/8 index pa   tients. Interestingly, all 15q13.3 microdeletions were inherited (3 from  the mother, 2 from the father). The affected parents had mild mental  retardation with epilepsy in one. In particular, the microdeletion was  found in 2 completely asymptomatic mothers. This study is in favour  of incomplete penetrance and more variable clinical expressivity than  previously published. Therefore, the 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion  might be only considered as a risk factor for mental retardation.

688,455,Not so irrelevant pseudomosaicism of trisomy 18 previously  found in amniotic fluid culture,P03.047,,"In 1993, a woman (G4, P3) underwent amniocentesis because of ma   ternal age. Regular chromosome analysis resulted in thirteen colonies  showing a normal female karyotype and a single isolated metaphase  with 47,XX,+18. After extensive work up according to international pre   natal quality standards, no other colony  with trisomy 18 was found in a  total of 29 colonies. Therefore, the  finding of a single Ã¢ÂÂ47,XX,+18Ã¢ÂÂ cell  was considered to represent a pseudomosaicism and the foetus was  diagnosed with a normal female karyotype. Fifteen years later and at the age of 14, the very same girl was re   ferred to our department because of mental retardation and autistiform  behaviour. After exclusion of a (pre)mutation for Fragile X syndrome,  oligo array CGH analysis was performed, using the Agilent 105 K Ox   ford array (custom design ID: 019015), in search for a previously un   detected (sub)microscopic genomic imbalance. To our surprise, a slightly elevated ratio was found for all (2424) oligo  probes on chromosome 18, suggestive for a mosaic pattern of trisomy  18. No further genomic aberrations were detected. Subsequent FISH  analysis on interphase and metaphase cells of blood and other tissue   samples from the patient confirmed the presence of a mosaic pattern  for trisomy 18.

Born at term with normal growth parameters, he demonstrated since  the age of 6 months, growth and weight retardation. Delay in motor  milestones was observed as the child did not sit alone at 9 months. He  had also reduced social interactions. G banding showed the presence of a supernumerary chromosome  (47,XY,+mar), composed, as revealed by high resolution aCGH, of  27 Mb from region 9p24.3 to 9p21.2 and 12,3 Mb from 15q11.2 to  15q13.3. This derivative chromosome [der(15)t(9;15)(p21.2;q13.3)]  was subsequently found to derive from a maternal reciprocal trans   location, very likely originating from a meiotic missegregation of 3:1  tertiary type. Partial trisomy 9p21.2 9pter is not well defined but two patients with an  intrachromosomal duplication of chromosome arm 9p [dup(9)(p21p24)]  demonstrated classical clinical manifestations of 9p trisomy with, in  one case, features overlapping with Coffin Siris syndrome. Duplication of the 15q Prader Willi /Angelman syndrome region is  mainly associated with autistic behavior, mental retardation and de   velopmental delay. Most reported cases with associated clinical symp   toms have been linked to extra copies of 15q11 q13 from maternal  origin, paternally derived duplications being generally associated with  a normal phenotype. Our results also support this observation. Presence of potential extra copies of numerous genes from chromo   some 9p in addition to the duplicated 15q region renders a clinical  prognosis difficult.

We are conducting a 5 year longitudinal study on the natural history  of AS, to improve our understanding of the complications, morbidity  and neurodevelopment in AS. We present the baseline clinical data  that describes characteristics of the first 102 subjects enrolled in our  study. Methods: All subjects were between 5 months and 26 years old. Sub   jects were evaluated by detailed history, physical examination, stan   dardized neurodevelopmental assessments, and electroencephalo   grams (EEG). Deletions were sized using a chromosome 15 specific  comparative genomic hybridization microarray. Results: The median age of the 102 subjects was 36 months (80%  were between 17 months and 60 months). 74% of subjects had dele   tions, 15% had either imprinting defects or uniparental disomy, and  12% had UBE3A  mutations. The most common findings were mouth   ing behavior in 93%, short attention span in 91%, microcephaly in 81%,  sleep difficulties in 79%, ataxic or broad based gait in 78%, fascination  with water in 75%, and inappropriate laughter was observed in 62% of  subjects. Clinical seizures were reported in 69% of subjects, although  all EEGs were abnormal. Data on the variations in these characteris   tics by molecular subtype will be presented. Conclusions: In children with AS, it is the neurobehavioral phenotype,  rather than the dysmorphic features or seizures, that is most char   acteristic.

We present 14 new  7q11.23 cases with the reciprocal duplication of the Williams Beuren  syndrome critical region, 9 familial and 5 de novo . These were iden   tified by either array based MLPA or by array CGH/oligonucleotide  analysis in a series of patients with idiopathic mental retardation with  an estimated population frequency of 1:13.000 1:20.000. Interchromo   somal recombination is the preferred exchange mechanism by which  the duplication arises. The CYLN2  gene within the duplicated region  is approximately 2 times overexpressed in carriers of the duplication.  The expression of the GTF2I  gene, just on the boundary of the dupli   cated region and thus with only 2 intact copies present in patients, was  also significantly increased. Variable speech delay is a constant finding in our patient group, con   firming previous reports. Cognitive abilities range from normal to mod   erate mental retardation. The association with autism is present in five  patients and in one father who also carries the duplication. There is  an increased incidence of hypotonia and congenital anomalies: heart  defects (PDA), diaphragmatic hernia, cryptorchidism and non spe   cific brain abnormalities on MRI.

728,1004,A 2.2mb microduplication in 1q42.2 including DISC  in 2  brothers with autism and mild mental retardation,P09.018,,"A growing number of copy number variations (CNV) are detected in  individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the interpre   tation is not always straightforward. We describe the identification and delineation of a 2.2Mb microdupli   cation in 1q42.2 in 2 brothers with autism and mild mental retardation. The duplication was detected by Array CGH with clones from the 1 Mb  BAC/PAC clone set (Sanger Institute Hinxton, UK). The aberration was  further delineated to 2.2Mb with a full tiling BAC array. By means of  quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) the breakpoints of the duplication  were mapped and segregation in the family was investigated. qPCR  was used to screen 260 patients with autism for DISC1  duplications. The 2.2Mb duplication was present in the proband, his affected brother  and the apparently unaffected father and paternal grandmother. Since  this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, it was con   sidered as a rare variant. Within this region the most interesting gene  with respect to autism is DISC1  (disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ) since  it is known to be involved in schizophrenia and has recently been as   sociated to autism and bipolar disorder. A group of 260 patients with  autism was studied for the occurrence of DISC1  duplications, but no  additional duplications were found.

The ma   jority of AS cases is X linked (XLAS) and caused by mutations in the  COL4A5 gene. The COL4A5 contains 51 exons with more than 400  mutations reported throughout the gene. We present here a compre   hensive molecular testing for XLAS using several technologies and an  algorithm that maintains good sensitivity while limiting cost. For adult onset XLAS, we developed an assay identifying the three  most common adult type XLAS mutations in the US; C1564S, L1649R,  and R1677Q. For molecular diagnostic testing of individuals with unknown mutations  we developed a DNA sequencing assay to identify point mutations and  small deletions and insertions.

774,11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,,"People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2   gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth  movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects  of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly  conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and  function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak   ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have  been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010.0,,S.

825,461,Duplications 20p and 3q as a consequence of familial  complex chromosomal rearrangement,P03.037,,"Balanced complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) are extreme   ly rare. Their carriers have a high risk of primary infertility, spontane   ous abortions or children with unbalanced karyotypes. We report an  unusual case of a familial CCR involving three chromosomes. An 8 year old girl was referred for chromosome analysis because of  heart defect, dysmorphic facial features, mild mental retardation and  autistic features including a delay of speech development. Karyotyping  revealed derivative chromosomes 20 and 22. For further clarification of  the rearrangement, FISH was performed using 20p and 20q subtelo   meric probes. It showed that material from 20p was translocated onto  22p. Array CGH was essential for the identification of the suspected  third partner in this CCR: It showed a 3q duplication of about 16.5 Mb,  and the CCR thus involved chromosomes 3, 20 and 22. Karyotyping and FISH analysis of other relatives indicated that four  members of this family are carriers of a balanced form of this CCR.  These individuals are asymptomatic. Four of their descendants have  two types of unbalanced CCRs. The proband and her maternal aunt  have partial duplications of chromosome 3. Both have similar dysmor   phic facial features and mental retardation, but the aunt is lacking the  heart defect and autism. Two other individuals have partial duplica   tions of chromosome 20.

827,489,t wo girls with mental retardation and behavioural  abnormalities: is the deletion of the A tXN1 gene on 6p22.3 a  major factor in causing the phenotype?,P03.065,,"6p22 interstitial deletions are relatively rare, with only eight patients  described so far. The clinical phenotype in these patients includes  developmental delay/mental retardation, defects of brain, heart and  kidney, craniofacial malformations and dysmorphic features. The com   mon deleted region, 2.2 Mb, harbouring 12 genes, has been defined  as critical for this syndrome. ATXN1 , located within this interval, has  been suggested as a candidate gene for the mental retardation based  on its expression in CNS and the cognitive impairments manifested in  knock out mice. We report on two patients carrying partly overlapping  de novo deletions within 6p22.3, which are smaller than the ones pre   viously reported. Patient 1 displays mild mental retardation and behav   ioural problems; her 115 kb deletion (chr6:16215803 16332297, hg19)  encompasses only GMPR  and ATXN1 . Patient 2 has severe mental  retardation, autistic features and hyperactivity. Her deletion spans 2.3  Mb (chr6:14545576 16846846, hg19) and includes JARID2 , DTNBP1   and MYLIP , in addition to GMPR  and ATXN1 . Because the GMP re   ductases encoded by GMPR and GMPR2  have redundant functions,  haploinsufficiency of GMPR  is not likely causing the cognitive impair   ments in our patients. We therefore suggest that ATXN1 hemizygosity  is sufficient to cause the mental retardation in patient 1. Furthermore,  additional genes such as MYLIP , which is expressed in brain and has  been shown to have a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, is expected  to contribute to the significantly more severe phenotype of patient 2.Cytogenetics11",2010.0,,"T.

Mutations of SH2D1A  are  responsible for the X linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. We present 3 patients from 2 families with complete deletions of the  SH2D1A  gene. The first patient was an 18 year old man with Burkitt Cancer genetics1 lymphoma treated by intensive chemotherapy at the age of 16 followed  by severe aplastic anaemia treated by stem cell transplantation from  his brother. Molecular analysis showed a deletion of all SH2D1A  exons.  His maternal cousin, a 25 year old man with mild learning difficulties,  mild autistic features and severe epidermolysis bullosa like dermatitis  that manifested at the age of 8 years, carried the same deletion. Due  to this atypical phenotype, array CGH was performed to specify the  extent of the deletion. It was about 65 kb long and removed also the 3Ã¢ÂÂ  terminal part of the ODZ1  gene.

855,947,Identification and characterization of copy number  variations in 50 children with autism,P09.021,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in the first  three years of life. The group of pervasive developmental disorders  (PDDs), also termed autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), includes the  prototypical autism as well as PDD not otherwise specified (PDD), Complex traits and polygenic disorders220 Rett syndrome and AspergerÃ¢ÂÂs disorder. Autism is characterized by  difficulties in managing social interaction and communication, and a  limited, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of reactions and behavior.  ASDs are etiologically heterogenous, and only 10% of the cases are  due to known medical conditions (chromosomal imbalances, genetic  disorders like Fragile X, Rett syndrome or Tuberous sclerosis). The emerge of new high resolution screening methods allows for de   tection of submicroscopic genomic aberrations. One of these methods;  microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) offers  the possibility of detecting copy number variations (CNVs, deletions or  duplications) associated with autism. We present the results of applying aCGH for identification of causal  CNVs in 50 children diagnosed with autism. Genomic DNA was ex   tracted from buccal cells and aCGH was performed using 44k and  105k human genome CGH oligo microarrays (Agilent Technologies  Inc.). Causal CNVs were identified in 9 (18%) of the patients. Two pa   tients had large aberrations (unbalanced translocation between chro   mosome 8 and chromosome 12, idic(15)). Five patients had smaller  CNVs in or close to genes previously associated with autism, and  two patients had CNVs not previously reported. Further analyses are  needed to determine the significance of these aberrations.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.  Conclusion: The Arg468His mutation is the most prevalent (6/14 fami   lies) mutation in MFN2 causing CMT2A in Spanish patients and our  study confirmed that it is actually pathological, presenting as a neu   ropathy in a mild to moderate degree.",2010.0,,"T.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.  Conclusion: The Arg468His mutation is the most prevalent (6/14 fami   lies) mutation in MFN2 causing CMT2A in Spanish patients and our  study confirmed that it is actually pathological, presenting as a neu   ropathy in a mild to moderate degree.",2010.0,,"T.

927,42, Ankylosing s pondylitis,S10.2,,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory arthropathy affecting  primarily the spine and pelvis, with a disease prevalence of 0.4% in white Europeans. Susceptibility to AS is known to be highly heritable (h2>90%), and the major gene for the condition, HLA B27, has been known since 1972. However, only 1 5% of HLA B27 carriers develop  AS, and 10 20% of cases do not carry the gene, suggesting that other genes must be involved. Genetic studies of AS have made rapid progress over the past 5 years, with associations with novel genes 14 Concurrent Symposia 14 and genetic loci providing insights into the disease pathogenesis,  stimulating much follow up functional research and therapeutic development.In order to identify further genetic variants predisposing to AS, a gwas was performed involving 1782 British and Australian cases fulfilling  modified New York Criteria, and 5167 historical controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2). The study was combined with existing results from the Australo Anglo American AS Consortium (TASC) consortium, and replication of the most significant findings performed in 2109 cases and 4410 controls from Australia, Britain, and the Canadian SPARCC consortium. As well as confirming known associations at HLA, IL23R, ERAP1, KIF21B, 2p15  and 21q22,   we identified and subsequently replicated risk predisposing variants in RUNX3, IL12B, and LTBR, and found suggestive association at  ANTXR2, PTGER4, CARD9 , TRADD and TBKBP1 TBX21. Additionally, we identified a single SNP within the MHC, rs4349859,  which lies near the gene MICA and tags HLA B27 with near perfect sensitivity (98%) and specificity (99%). Studies in cases and controls carrying different HLA B27 subtypes, some AS associated and some not, indicate that rs4349859 is not itself AS causative, and further reduce the likelihood that an HLA B*27 linked gene is responsible for the association of B27 with AS. This SNP is far cheaper and easier to genotype than HLA B*27 itself, and can be used as an alternative to HLA B*27  typing, at least in European populations. In most common diseases the proposed genetic model involves interaction between loci, but to date no convincing examples of such interaction have been demonstrated. We identified an interaction  between HLA B*27 and variants within ERAP1 in the WTCCC2  (p,0.02), TASC (p,0.014) and replication datasets (p,0.0019). Specifically, risk variants in ERAP1 increased odds of disease in  HLA B*27  positive, but not HLA B*27 negative, cases (combined  P,7.3x10  6). In contrast, SNPs at other AS loci, including IL23R,  KIF21B, IL12B and the intergenic regions 2p15 and 21q22, were AS  associated in both HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27  ve disease. This  result indicates that HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27  ve forms of disease  have substantially different but overlapping aetiologies. Interestingly,  in a separate WTCCC2 study, we have demonstrated that ERAP1is associated with psoriasis, and that the association is restricted to cases carrying the HLA Class I protein HLA Cw6. The findings support mechanisms of association of HLA B*27  and ERAP1 with AS that  involve peptide presentation, and that ERAP1 contributes to disease risk through its action in trimming peptides prior to loading into nascent HLA class I molecules, rather than by cleaving pro inflammatory cytokine receptors on the cell membrane.Many further genes are likely to be identified over the coming years.  The International Genetics of Ankylosing Spondylitis Consortium will perform what will likely be the definitive SNP genotyping study of AS, involving over 12,000 cases and 20,000 healthy controls genotyped for 200,000 markers targeting immunogenetically relevant genes using the Ã¢ÂÂImmunochipÃ¢ÂÂ. This study will bring new findings including new genes, fine mapping of known genes, data about the value of genetic risk prediction in different world populations, and even pharmacogenetic data regarding TNF antagonist response and intolerance.These findings provide substantial material for the functional biology community to research, with the promise of early translation in both therapeutics and improved diagnostic tests.",2011.0,,"M.

In India, metropolitan cities like Chennai, Hyderabad etc. are showing an increased incidence of stress related disorders like Thyroid malfunction, Polycystic Ovarian Disease, infertility etc., and hence assisted reproduction is on the rise among the young urban population.

972,413, Approach to molecular screening in Polish patients with hearing loss,P02.156,,"Background: In European countries, about 2/1000 children suffer from severe congenital or prelingually hearing loss, another 1 / 300 children are born with a minor degree of hearing loss. Causes of hearing loss are complex and in most cases harbor a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is assumed that approximately 60% of  isolated cases of hearing loss are genetic. For this type of hearing loss most often are responsible mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 genes. The optimal diagnostic algorithm for this group of patients can reduce the cost of conducting effective research and genetic counseling.Aims: The aim of the study was to present an algorithm of molecular investigations in patients with a suspicion of a genetic based hearing loss.Materials: 6882 DNA samples retrieved from patients suffering from bilateral hearing loss prelingual and postlingual, varying in degree from  mild to severe. Only non consanguineous patients (probands) were included for the analysis.Methods: Mutliplex PCR test for 5 common Polish GJB2 mutations, direct sequencing of coding exon of GJB2 gene, rtPCR test for the presence of IVS1+1G>A mutation, AS PCR for the detection of GJB6 D13S1830 deletion, real time PCR for the detection of MELAS 3243 A>G mutation.Results: Molecular analysis, performed step by step, revealed presence of the two pathogenic mutations in a group of 720 among 4103 analyzed probands.Conclusions: Application of the optimal algorithm of molecular tests can detect the cause of hearing impairment in about 18% of patients.",2011.0,,"A.

There are feeding difficulties and regurgitations. He has a global developmental delay, especially speech development is impaired. There are an autistic like  manner and phases of behaviour problems with restlessness and laughter attacks.Molecular cytogenetic analysis of the subtelomeric regions identified a secondary signal of the chromosome 21 subtelomere probe on the distal short arm of one chromosome 21.

The inv dup (15) or idic (15) is the most common of the heterogeneous  group of the extra structurally abnormal chromosomes (ESAC). Two cytogenetics types have been identified. One is a metacentric or submetacentric and heterochromatic chromosome, not containing the Prader Willi Syndrome/ Angelman Syndrome Critical Region  (PWS/ASCR) [dic(15)(q11).dic(15)(q11)], can be familial or de novo  and most children show a normal phenotype. The second type has 15q euchromatin including PWS/ASCR [dic(15)(q12 or q13)], that frequently derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis. This condition is associated with an abnormal phenotype, which constitutes the idic(15) syndrome, and is nearly always sporadic.The inv dup (15) displays distinctive clinical findings represented by early central hypotonia and intellectual disability, epilepsy and autistic behaviour. Expressive language is absent or very poor and  often echolalic. Epilepsy with a wide variety of seizures, as a typical Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), can occur in these individuals. Areas of increased and reduced skin pigmentation can be occasionally observed.We report on a 6 years old girl, patient of Neuropediatrics, with language delay, LGS and hypopigmented streaks on the trunk.

998,612,Report of a patient with distal Williams Beuren deletion.,P03.095,,"A 7 years old boy was referred to the genetic consultation given  psychomotor delay, learning difficulties and dysmorphism. He presents behavioral disorders as depression, impulsivity, hyperactivity and relationships difficulties with other children. EEG shows epilepsy. He uses short sentences but with pronunciations difficulties.  Developmental quotient was evaluated at 63 (Terman Merrill). Minor dysmorphic features were observed with upslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, mild retrognathia and protruding upper lip with long philtrum. Growth parameters at 7 years are in the normal range.CGH analysis showed a 2.015 Mb deletion distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. The deletion is maternally inherited. The family belongs to underprivileged socio cultural environment with relatives presenting learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities. Given this blurring familial situation, this deletion was initially considered as being  of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore polymorphic CNV were reported in this region.Two publications (Edelmann et al., 2007 ; J Med Genet 44:136 143 and Ramocki et al., 2010 ; Am J Hum Genet 87:857 865) reported  deletions or duplications distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. These patients exhibit variable expression of epilepsy, learning difficulties, intellectual disabilities (mild to severe developmental delay or intellectual disability with autistic features in some patients) and/or neurobehavioral abnormalities (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and aggression including self abusive behavior and depression). The majority of the patients have a deletion inherited from a normal or less affected parent. HIP1 and YWHAG genes are also deleted in our patient. However the inheritance from normal relatives, strongly  suggests an incomplete penetrance of this deletion which preclude a unambiguous genetic counseling.",2011.0,,"B. Grisart, S. Vidrequin, K.

1040,1064, Next generation sequencing of known and putative susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders to detect rare high penetrant risk variants,P08.64,,"Schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are  complex neurodevelopmental disorders that share certain phenotypes including cognitive deficits and some behavioural characteristics. Such similarities suggest that these disorders may share an underlying pathology and thus may share some genetic risk variants. This study  involves next generation sequencing of the exonic regions of 215 potential susceptibility genes in an Irish sample of 150 cases of ASD, 300 cases of SZ and 300 controls, in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms, indels and structural variants contributing to one or both disorders. A multiplex target enrichment method is used whereby DNA samples are multiplexed together using DNA indexes/barcodes and enriched for the exonic regions of these genes using the Agilent SureSelect target enrichment method. This is followed by 80bp paired end sequencing in a single lane of an Illumina GAII. Gene selection  comprised of five categories: 1) Interactors of NRXN1, 2) Interactors of DISC1, 3) Genes within the Glutamate Receptor Complexes; NMDA, mGluR5 and AMPA, 4) Cell adhesion molecules and 5) Functional and Positional Candidates. Analysis of the pilot set of samples indicates that the approach undertaken is successful with an even spread of sequence information for 24 indexed samples per lane, >8X coverage for 84% of target regions and overall SNP concordance with previous GWAS data (Affymetrix 6.0) of 99.3%.

1044,1099, A long non coding RNA accounts for Angelman syndrome like neurodevelopmental disorder,P09.018,,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder  characterized by severe mental retardation and autistic like features. AS is due to lack of UBE3A gene expression, but in 15% of the cases the molecular cause still remains unknown. Long non coding RNAs (lncRNA) constitute a large portion of the human transcriptome,  which regulates gene expression by different mechanisms, including splicing, translational repression and epigenetic regulation. The spatial and temporal expression of lncRNA appears to be extremely important for the development and function of the central nervous system. Our study is focused on an AS like patient with an unusual combination of a deletion that involves lncRNA AK097590 inherited from one parent, and a rare SNP within AK097590 inherited from the other parent. Besides, this SNP leads to a change in the predicted secondary structure of AK097590 that may affect its normal function. We have  performed AK097590 knock down experiments in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. qPCR assays have demonstrated that a decrease of AK097590 levels is sufficient to modify the expression of UBE3A, PRKCG and PPP2R1A. Interestingly, these genes have a role in synaptic plasticity and long term depression, which are reduced in AS murine models. Our results suggest that changes in the expression levels of AK097590 may contribute to the clinical features associated to AS, offering a novel molecular basis for the cases non associated with mutations in UBE3A. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanism of AK097590 lncRNA and its target genes may help in the development of therapeutic strategies for these neurodevelopmental disorders.",2011.0,,"S.

Many rare Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that harbor  small genomic deletions and insertions have been described in the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To identify these likely functional elements, we combined three previously published large cohorts of autistic patients with a large number of controls to analyze over 25K unrelated individuals. After stringent quality control measures, we compared 3K cases to over 19K ethnically matched controls in a two stage genome wide association design. In all, we uncovered 275 statistically significant distinct copy number variable regions. The 60 genes nearest these robust CNVRs are most enriched in gene networks impacting neurological disease, behavior and developmental disorder. A more focused analysis of a subset of 87 CNVRs that are predicted to disrupt 26 genes highlights GABA receptor signaling, and methionine/glutathione trans sulfuration as the most significant canonical pathways disrupted in ASD. Furthermore, we used available family members to characterize CNVRs into inherited vs de novo and used ethnicity information to characterize their effects in different ethnic populations. Taken together, the CNVRs we have identified impact multiple novel genes and signaling pathways, including genes involved in GABA receptor signaling, that may be important for new  personalized therapeutic development.",2011.0,,"D.

Some contradictory results on association of activating and inhibitory  alleles of killer immunoglobulin like receptor KIR3D gene with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were reported. Only one of the studies analyzed the association in the context of functionality of polymorphic KIR3DL1. In our study we analyzed both the frequencies of alleles  encoding inhibitory and activating KIR3D receptors and alleles encoding functional (KIR3DL1*F) and non functional (KIR3DL1*004) inhibitory receptors in two Russian Caucasian cohorts which include 83 AS patients and 107 HLA B27 positive healthy donors. Presence of low expressed KIR3DL1*005 and KIR3DL1*007 alleles was also detected.The frequency of KIR3DS1 allele was found to be higher (30.7% vs 18.7%, p < 0.01, OR , 1.93) and the frequency of KIR3DL1 allele was found to be lower (69.3% vs 81.3%, p < 0.01, OR , 0.52) in the  AS cohort. Also it was found that the KIR3DL1*004 allele frequency are near equal in both cohorts, and the decrease of KIR3DL1 allele frequency in the AS cohort is due to the KIR3DL1*F but not KIR3DL1*004 frequencies. Likewise the frequencies of genotypes carrying KIR3DL1*004 was found to be near equal in both cohorts. 9 from 17 KIR3DL1*F/KIR3DL1*F AS patients carry at least one of low expressed allele.These findings support the hypothesis that KIR3DL1 is not simply a passive counterpart of the segregating KIR3DS1 allele product but play a protective role, although the presence of activating KIR3DS1 allele is more important for AS susceptibility.

1132,1579, t hree novel mutations in t urkish patients with Alstrom s yndrome,P12.007,,"AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome (AS) is a rare multisystemic disorder. Major clinical symptoms of the disease are congenital retinal dystrophy leading to blindness, neurosensorial hearing lost, childhood obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutant form of ALMS1 gene causes AS. ALMS1 is a novel gene which is comprised  of 23 exons encoding a protein of 4169 amino acids that does not  share significant sequence homology with any other known genes. The ALMS1 protein is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies of ciliated cells, perhaps playing an important role in cilia function and intraflagellar transport. RNA interference knockdown experiments indicate that a total lack of ALMS1 impairs cilia formation. To date, more than 100 mutations, mostly nonsense and frameshift type, in ALMS1 have been reported in AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome. The reported mutations are primarily clustered in exons 16, 10, and 8, but less  common mutations also occur in exons 12, 18 and 11. In present study, four Turkish AS patients were analysed. Mutation screening of the whole coding region and all intron/exon boundaries were performed by PCR and direct sequencing.

They have been divided into syndromic and non syndromic according to the association of 422 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders additional features. Identification of genes causing non syndromic  XLMR has long been challenging but large scale systematic resequencing has been shown to be promising for the discovery of rare, disease causing sequence variants.We report on a family including 10 affected males with severe MR  and several females with variable cognitive impairment consistent with X linked recessive inheritance. Male patients all had severe mental retardation and behavior problems. Dysmorphic features included long narrow face, malar hypoplasia, large forehead, full nasal root, thin nose, small philtrum. Head circumference was normal. They had no marfanoid habitus or visceral malformations. Brain MRI, in two patients, showed isolated moderate cerebral atrophy. Most affected females were moderately mentally affected but one of them had severe MR with autistic features. The initial linkage study revealed a localization region from Xp11.21 (AlaS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5) in 6 of 7 affected males. A novel, unreported frameshift mutation was identified in the MED12 gene  by exome sequencing performed within the EuroMRX consortium. The mutation segregated with disease in all affected males. MED12  encodes a subunit of the mediator complex, which serves as an interface between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.

We have found one already described variant (M1589V) and six novel heterozygous missenses with five of  them observed in a single patient each. Three out of these five variants were predicted as possibly or probably pathogenic using Polyphen. Parental samples have been obtained for one case: the R2131S substitution has been found in both affected and healthy relatives and  is thus unlikely to be pathogenic. Other parental samples were not available yet.Among the eighteen variants observed in American and French  cohorts, five have since been reported in the dbSNP database and one is also found in an unaffected individual, questioning the implication of DMXL1 in the disease and suggesting a rarer frequency of possibly pathogenic variants than reported initially (2.7% at the most).",2011.0,,"N.

The NADPH system is considered to be the most important source of super oxide anion (*O 2 )  in vascular cells such as smooth muscle and endothelial cells. The CYBA gene (16q24) encodes the essential subunit of the NADPH oxidase p22phox and has several allelic variants, some of them in the promoter region associated with higher transcriptional activity, as the   930A/G (rs9932581). Once there is no data regarding the frequency of this variant in the Brazilian population, it was determined in 135 SCA patients and 66 controls through direct sequencing. In the SCA group, the GG, AG and AA genotype frequency was 33.3%, 48.9% and 17.8%, respectively while in the control group it was 37.9%, 45.4% and  16.7%. The frequency of the G allele was 57.8% in patients and 64.4% in controls and of the A allele it was 42.2% in patients and 35.6% in controls, similar to the ones reported by the HapMap Project for CEU and ASW populations. There is no statistically significant difference in the genotype distribution between patients and controls although p value is equal to 0.053; the alleles are in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in both groups.

This new methodologies have led to identification of novel genomic disorder in patients with developmental delay/mental retardation and/or multiple congenital anomalies (DD/MR/MCA), with a significant increase in diagnostic yield .In this study we present the result of array CGH obtained in 150 children with normal karyotype but DD/MR/MCA. The array CGH 60K from agilent platform was performed.In 34 patients (22,66%) was detected a chromosomal deletion or duplicati   on previously described like pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs),. In 15 cases (10%) was necessary the analysis of parental samples, showing that 6 anomalies (40%) had occurred de novo and was classified as pathogenic and in 9 cases (60%) appeared to be inherited from an unaffected parent. In a total of 40 patients (26,66%) was possible to detect a pathogenic CNVs .Recent studies suggest that when aCGH is performed with an apparently normal karyotype, the diagnostic yield increases by an additional 8 17%. In our study we have obtained a 26,66% of children with pathogenic CNVs that is higher than the results obtained by other authors.

Diagnostic testing including  high resolution karyotyping and extended metabolic screening were nor   mal. Brain MRI demonstrated a dysplasia of the DMJ with a characteristic  Ã¢ÂÂbutterflyÃ¢ÂÂ like contour of the midbrain on axial sections. Additional ima ging features included variable degrees of supratentorial ventricular dilata   tion and hypoplasia to complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Diffusion tensor imaging showed diffuse hypomyelination and lack of an identifiable corticospinal tract. All patients displayed severe cognitive impairment, post natal progressive microcephaly, axial hypotonia, spastic quadriparesis and seizures. Autistic features were noted in older cases. Talipes equinovarus, non obstructive cardiomyopathy and persistent hyperplastic primary vi treous were additional findings in two families.

A 28 y old male originating from eastern Algeria with a diagnosis of Fragi  le X mental retardation established at the age of 12 y during evaluation of  severe learning disabilities married his second cousin. He required special  education in France and is currently working in a shelter. After an arrange ment has been decided by his family, his second cousin who was educated in  Algeria was married to him. Although he suffers moderate mental retarda  tion, his wife is of normal intelligence. A pregnancy developed soon thereaf ter. A male with the full mutation is expected to transmit alleles of premuta   tion size to his daughters, based on an experience of less than ten reported  cases. This is why prenatal testing is still recommended for a female fetus  of a fully mutated genitor. Fetal DNA was extracted from cultured amnio cytes and submitted to Southern blotting and (CGG)n PCR analysis. While  the father is mosaic for a methylated full mutation in lymphocytes (around  20% of the cells are not methylated), his wife has two normal alleles. The female fetus harbored a normal allele and a 105 CGG repeats premutation.  She was therefore predicted to be unaffected with Fragile X syndrome and  the pregnancy was pursued. Repeat ultrasound examination of the fetus was normal. After an uneventful pregnancy, the woman gave birth to a healthy female baby. Reproduction in Fragile X males is exceptional.

1208,287, Detection of serum anti neuronal antibodies in patients with Fragile X syndrome,P02.103,,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and known cause of autism. The mutation responsible for FRAXA is a large expansion of the trinucleotide CGG repeats at 5Ã¢ÂÂ end of the FMR1 gene  resulting in the transcriptional silencing of the gene. There are close simila rities between autism profiles in idiopathic and comorbid autism (FXS).Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency of serum anti neural antibodies in a group of 23 Fragile X males.Material and methods: Serum anti neuronal antibodies were measured by Western blot technique (Anti neuronal Antigens EUROLINE WB EUROIM   MUN) in 23 patients with FXS (full mutation in the FMR1 gene), aged bet  ween 10 and 32 years, in comparison to 19 healthy matched malesResults: We detected the presence of antibodies in the serum of 10 FXS ma les and in 1 from the reference group.

All participants were tested with standardized neu ropsychological tests and 4 questionnaires investigating psychological pro blems.KS patients scored significantly lower in processing speed, working memo ry, verbal abilities and showed a selective deficit in executive function com pared to control subjects, whereas visual cognitive abilities and cognitive response inhibition was preserved. The KS patients displayed significantly  higher levels of cognitive failures, emotional distress and autism traits as reported in questionnaires. Furthermore symptoms of anxiety were also si gnificantly higher among KS patients, whereas there were no difference in depressive symptoms between KS patients and control subjects. On the NEO PI R personality test KS patients scored high on the neuroticism scale, low on the extraversion scale and low on the conscientiousness scale.Men with KS have deficits in several cognitive domains and have an alte red personality phenotype. Furthermore our results suggest that KS patient may be associated with an increased genetic vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms.

We have identified pericetromeric deletion and duplication, within 16p11.2 p12.2 in three patients by Cytogenetics 2.7M array. Patient 1 was a 10 year old girl with autism and obesity. She had a heterozygous 593kb deletion in 16p11.2. Her mother with the same deletion was not autistic, but was obese. Patient 2 was a 2 year old boy with VSD, hypotonia, developmental delay and frequent ear infections. He had.dysmorphic features including flat face, down slanting palpebral fissures, low set posteriorly rotated ears and thin upper lip. Autistic features were not seen. Microarray analysis revealed a 7.7Mb deletion at 16p11.2 p12.2. He showed common clinical features to the 16p11.2 p12.2 deletion syndrome. Patient 3 was an 8 year old girl with developmental delay, autism and dysmophic features including hypertri   chosis, wide mouth and macrocephaly. She showed poor communication skills and ritualized patterns of interests and behavior. Microarray analysis revealed a 6.7Mb duplication at 16p11.2 p12.2.

1241,470,Chromosome kissing in association with the ATR X syndrome,P03.036,,"ATR X (X linked ÃÂ± thalassemia / mental retardation) syndrome is one of the syndromes associated with abnormal epigenetic gene regulation, which  appears males with X linked mental retardation, HbH disease, skeletal ab   normalities, and autistic behavior. ATR X syndrome is caused by a mutation  in the ATRX gene localized on the X chromosome (Xq21.1), which encodes  ATRX protein, one of the chromatin remodeling proteins. However, the  details of molecular mechanism with symptoms of this syndrome are still unknown. Here to learn more about the relationships between nuclear ar chitecture and failure of epigenetic regulation in the ATR X syndrome, we ex   amined characteristics of spatial positioning of following three chromosome arm specific regions by 3D FISH technique; 1) Xq (ATRX gene has mapped on), 2) 16p (HBA has mapped on), and 3) 11p (HBB has mapped on). After  image acquisition by confocal laser scaning microscope, analysis of relative  spatial positioning of three painted regions was performed. The results sho   wed that neighborhood association of particular two chromosome territory  regions called as chromosome kissing was observed with high frequency  between Xq and 16p and between 11p and 16p in cell nuclei from the ATR X syndrome patients, respectively. The frequency of the same combination from the normal individual is approximately halves of them, respectively.

1285,896, Analysis of polymorphisms in GABRA2 and AUTS2 genes in patients with alcoholism from Russia,P08.02,,"Family, twin and adoption studies have provided evidence of a genetic component (40 60%) in the origins of addictive disorders. One of very few confirmed genetic association findings differentiating alcoholics from non alcoholics is with variants in the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid a2 receptor subunit (GABRA2 ) gene. Also according to the recent genome  wide association study variation in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2 ) was strongly associated with alcohol consumption. Population  stratification and ancestry differences within populations may compromise the success of association studies. Therefore analysis of genes variants in homogeneous ethnic groups is of great importance.We designed a classical case control association study for two polymorphis   ms: rs279858 in GABRA2  and rs6943555 in AUTS2  that were tested for asso   ciation with alcoholism. 307 men with ICD 10 diagnosis of alcoholism (112 Russians, 91 Tatars, 100 Bashkirs), and matched control groups were typed for the above mentioned gene variants using PCR RFLP technique.In Russian population the frequency of individuals carrying the *G allele of  rs279858 polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with early onset alcoholism as compared with the healthy controls (p,0.03;OR,1.40). The carriers of GABRA2*A/*A  genotype were found to be at low risk of al   coholism development (p,0.04;OR,0,57). In Tatars the frequency of AUTS2   rs6943555 *T allele was higher in group of alcoholics with acute alcohol  psychosis (0.74) as compared with controls (0.64). However observed diffe rences were not statistically significant.Our results suggest that GABRA2  genetic variation might be involved in the  development of alcoholism in Russians.

X linked AS (XLAS) is caused by COL4A5  mutations and the autosomal recessive and do   minant forms of AS and TBMN are due to COL4A3  and/or COL4A4  mutations.  Approximately 80% of AS is X linked.Aim: Describe the molecular pathology of XLAS in Portuguese families.Patients and methods: In the setting of an ongoing national multicenter  study, 51 unrelated patients with the clinical diagnosis of AS referred by ne phrologists have already been studied. Mutational analysis of COL4A5  gene  was performed by direct PCR sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Direct PCR sequencing of the COL4A3  and CO  L4A4  genes will be subsequently performed in COL4A5  negative cases.

We have performed mutation analysis in the MCPH1, WDR62, CDK5RAP2, CEP152, ASPM, CENPJ, STIL and PNKP genes using haplotype analysis and direct sequencing in 14 families and 10 sporadic patients. Mu   tations were found in the ASPM (5 families, 8 patients), WDR62 (5 families, 5 patients), CDK5RAP2 (1 family, 2 patients), STIL (1 family, 1 patient) and PNKP (1 family, 1 patient) genes. Twelve of the 16 different mutations found have not been previously described. All patients had severe developmental delay, with speech development being most severely affected. All patients showed a MCD in addition to severe microcephaly. The mildest brain pheno type was associated with ASPM mutation and a characteristic combination of polymicrogyria and pachygyria was associated with WDR62 mutation. Patients with CDK5RAP2 and PNKP mutation had agenesis of the corpus callosum in addition to simplified gyration. The recognition of specific pat   terns associated with mutation of each of the MCPH genes will aid targeted diagnosis in the future.

Autosomal dominant microcephaly with mild to moderate mental re  tardation with no dysmorphism or other anomalies was diagnosed in  eleven individuals of an Arab Israeli family. Craniosynostosis and envi  ronmental factors were ruled out per history as possible contributors to the disease, thus verifying the diagnosis of primary microcephaly.  Brain CT scan of affected individuals showed no architectural anoma  lies. Nine living affected individuals were available for clinical and ge netic evaluation.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints characterized by degradation of the hyaline articular cartilage and remodeling of the sub chondral bone with sclerosis. Asporin (ASPN) gene encodes a cartilage ex   tracellular protein that is member of the small leucine rich proteoglycan fa mily. Polymorphisms in the aspartic acid repeat region in the second exon of this gene, that is consist of GAT repeats, are associated with a susceptibility to osteoarthritis. The D14 allele (an allele containing 14 D repeats) is asso   ciated with increased OA susceptibility in Japanese and Han Chinese, but is not an important factor in OA etiology among Caucasians, although the D15 allele is considered a risk allele for Greek population. To apprise the possible association, that seems controversially, we explored the ASPN effect in Ira nian patients with knee OA. The D repeat polymorphism was genotyped in 100 knee OA patients and 100 control subjects, and the allelic association of the D repeat was examined. Our data suggest that the D15 allele could  be considered a risk allele significant only for females (p,0.045) of Iranian  population.

1391,4, C terminal deletions of the AUTS2 locus cause distinct syndromic features and cognitive impairment,PL2.2,,"Translocations involving 7q21.22 have been associated with autism and in tellectual disability (ID). Discordant evidence has suggested that these cli nical phenotypes might be driven by a number of genes (AUTS2, WBSCR17, CALN1). Here, we examined whether AUTS2 disruptions are causal for neu  rocognitive defects.An international cohort of ~50,000 patients and 16,000 controls was ex   amined for CNVs in AUTS2 by array CGH and we performed detailed pheno  typic analyses. 5âRACE experiments were performed to test for alternative transcripts in human brain. A zebrafish knock down model was generated to test the potential of different AUTS2  splice isoforms to induce some of the  anatomical phenotypes seen in patients.We found 44 AUTS2 deletions. Microdeletions disrupting the coding se   quence were causal to a complex syndromic ID/autism phenotype including short stature, microcephaly, cerebral palsy and distinct facial dysmorphis   ms. The exonic AUTS2 deletions occur with a frequency comparable to NSD1  deletions causing Sotos syndrome. We also discovered a novel, highly con served, C terminal AUTS2 isoform in human brain. Clinical and functional  studies showed this isoform to be a key contributor to the human phenotype because (a) patients with C terminal deletions exhibited significantly more severe and pleiotropic aspects of AUTS2  syndrome, and (b) the significant  microcephaly and craniofacial defects seen in auts2 knockdown zebrafish  embryos were rescued by this C terminal isoform.We identified a hitherto unappreciated syndromic phenotype caused by deletions in AUTS2,  required for both brain and craniofacial development.  The C terminal portion of the gene contributes significantly to the pheno type, demonstrating how transcriptional complexity can underpin human pathology.  E. Voorhoeve: None. G. Beunders: None. C.

1395,23, The role of glia in neurodegenerative diseases,S04.2,,"of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States. The great biologists of the 19th century, especially Virchow and Bernard, established the pivotal idea that individual cells function autonomously, while being part of the whole organism. Since then many the major neu rodegenerative diseases have traditionally been considered mechanistically cell autonomous, meaning that damage within a selective population of af fected neurons alone suffices to produce disease. Most of the genes whose mutation is now known to cause the major neurodegenerative diseases are widely or ubiquitously expressed, however, including superoxide dismutase (SOD1) whose mutation causes an inherited form of the fatal, adult motor neuron disease ALS. Modeling in mice has demonstrated that disease mecha nism is through an acquired toxicity unrelated to dismutase activity. Selec tive gene excision has demonstrated that toxicity is non cell autonomous, with mutant SOD1 within motor neurons and oligodendrocytes driving disease onset, while damage within neighboring astrocytes and microglia accelerates disease progression. Non cell autonomy is a general feature of human neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinsonâs and frontal tem poral dementia, where disease has been demonstrated to spread from cell to cell in a prion like manner, and in Huntingtonâs disease (HD), an inherited disease caused by tri nucleotide expansion.An approach to therapy is suppression of disease causing genes following infusion of DNA antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to direct RNase H depen   dent destruction of the target mRNA widely within the nervous system. Such an approach slows disease progression in inherited examples of ALS like disease in rodents. Moreover, infusion of ASOs targeting huntingtin mRNA effectively lowers huntingtin levels in the striatum and cortex, the primary brain targets of HD pathology. Transient infusion into already symptomatic HD mouse models mediates a sustained reversal of disease phenotype that persists for much longer than the huntingtin knockdown. These findings establish a therapeutic strategy for sustained HD disease reversal from a âHuntingtin holidayâ produced by transient ASO therapy.   D.W. Cleveland: F.

1412,178,Genome wide assocation study identifies common variation associated with congenital heart disease,C18.5,,"We tested the hypothesis that common variants contribute to congenital heart disease by conducting a genome wide association study for Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) using a northern European discovery set of 835 cases and 5159 controls. A large region on chromosome 12q24 which includes PT  PN11  was associated (P , 1.4 Ã 10  7) and replicated in 798 cases and 2931  controls (replication P , 3.9 Ã 10 5; combined P , 7.7 Ã 10 11). SNPs in GPC5  on chromosome 13q32 were also associated (P , 1.7 Ã 10 7) and replica  ted convincingly in 789 cases and 2927 controls (replication P , 1.2 Ã 10 5;  combined P , 3.03 Ã 10 11). We extended the GWAS to a discovery cohort of  1,995 cases with various CHD phenotypes. A region on chromosome 4p16, between MSX1 and STX18, was associated (P,9.5x10  7) with the risk of atrial  septal defect (ASD; N,340 cases), and this was replicated in a further 445 ASD cases and 2520 controls (replication P,1.1x10  4; combined P,6.9x10  10). The association between SNPs at 12q24 and TOF was not apparent in  any other CHD subgroup; similarly, the association between SNPs at 4p16 and ASD was not apparent for CHD phenotypes other than ASD. We con clude that there is phenotypic specificity for common variants associated with CHD.  J. Goodship:  None. H. Cordell: None. J. Bentham: None. A. Topf: None. D.  Zelenika: None. S. Heath: None.

The non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs11209026 (Arg381Gln) in the IL23R gene, has reproducib ly been shown as associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Here, we ex   amined the association between rs11209026 and SpA as a whole. Particular attention was devoted to genotype phenotype correlation.Methods: rs11209026 was genotyped in a French collection of 415 cases/372 controls and 383 trios. Association analysis was carried out in SpA as a whole group and then separately in AS and non radiographic SpA (non AS) patients. Phenotype/genotype correlations were examined using a logistic regression analysis.Results: A significant association between rs11209026 and SpA was only identified in the familial dataset (P , 0.03; OR , 0.57). Strong associati on with AS was observed in both case/control and familial datasets (P , 4.5x10 4 and 4x10 3, respectively). In contrast, such association was not detected with the non AS group. Furthermore, rs11209026 frequency was significantly different between the AS and non AS patients (P , 2.5x10 3).

1431,321,Short report: Delineation of a new chromosome 20q11.2 duplication syndrome including the ASLX1 gene,P02.003,,"The current use of microarray based comparative genomic hybridization allowed the identification of novel cytogenetic abnormalities. Partial triso   mies of the long arm of chromosome 20 are rare. Here we report on three males with a de novo overlapping 7.5, 9.78 and 10 Mb duplication of chro  mosome 20q11.2. Together with another patient previously published in the literature with overlapping 20q11 microduplication, we showed that such patients display common clinical features including striking similar dysmorphic features with metopic ridging/trigonocephaly, full eyelids, epi canthal folds, moderate developmental delay, short hands, cryptorchidism, and normal growth to mild growth retardation. The minimal critical region of the duplication to 7.5 Mb encompassing 173 genes including ASLX1  gene  (MIM612990).  ASLX1  is a human homolog of the Drosophila asx gene which  is an homeotic gene. De novo heterozygous nonsense or truncating mutati   ons have been reported recently in patients with Borhing Opitz syndrome (MIM605039), a severe developmental and malformation disorder.Because of craniofacial features in common with Borhing Opitz syndrome, in particular metopic ridging/trigonocephaly, we suggest that duplication of ASXL1 may contribute to the phenotype. These observations suggest a  novel recognizable microduplication syndrome, and reporting of additional patients with molecular characterization will allow more detailed genotype phenotype correlations.

Inhe ritance is presumed X linked dominant but causative gene is unknown. We present girl without the classic AS triad who had PCRL due to chromosome 3 microdeletion.18 month old girl was evaluated for speech, motor delays, staring spells. She was born at 32 weeks gestation to pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. At birth, was noted to have left hand preaxial polydactyly, atrial septal de   fect, pulmonary valvular stenosis.

Retinal  examination showed bilateral PCRL, which consisted of depigmented areas  with variably pigmentated borders, surrounding optic discs. MRI revealed  mild thinning of corpus callosum and diffuse hypomyelination.Genomic hybridization microarray demonstrated 6 megabase interstitial  deletion of chromosome 3, spanning 3q21.3 to 3q22.1. Conclusions: PCRL are not unique to Aicardi syndrome.AS is thought to arise from gene mutation on X chromosome. Our patientâs large autosomal deletion comprised 66 genes, none known to be associated  with chorioretinal lacunae. It is possible that PCRL in our and patients with  AS may result from complex gene interactions between the X chromosome and autosomes.

The aim of this study was to identify genes which may contribute to these processes in asthmatic airways. To compare the gene expression profiles of human primary ASM cells from asthmatic (n,3) and healthy donors (n,3), Affymetrix GeneChip HuGene_1.0_ST Arrays were used. PartekÂ® analysis revealed 11 differentially expressed genes, which were not previously as sociated with asthma, including latrophilin 3 (LPHN3), a gene thought to be brain specific, which was up regulated in asthmatic ASM cells compared to healthy donors (3.4 fold p<0.001, n,3). Using qPCR LPHN3 and the family member LPHN1 were both found to be up regulated in asthmatics (n,16) compared with healthy donors (n,6, p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). The microarray predicted a single splice variant of LPHN3 increased in asthma tics which was confirmed by RT PCR and sequencing. The LPHN1 ligand, Î± LTX (toxin produced by black widow spider), increased proliferation of immortalised ASM cells (n,3, 1.21 & 1.20 fold, 0.3nM & 1nM, p<0.01 respec   tively) and induced the phosphorylation of AKT at 1 min (1nM). Addition of Î± LTX (10nM) caused contraction of human airways, while FLRT3 (LPHN3 ligand) had no direct effect.

Microdeletions and microduplications of the distal region  within 1q21.1 are susceptibility factors for a variety of neurodevelopmental phenotypes and distinct dysmorphic features. We present a 6 years old boy with severe intellectual disability, ASD, signi  ficant speech delay, hyperactivity and macrocephaly. He comes from 3rd pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia , diabetes and excessive obesity of the mother ( there were 2 sponatenous abortions from another partnership  of the mother). His early development was delayed  walking unattended at  18 months of age. He exhibits significant facial dysmorphism: macrocephaly with prominent forehead, long face, arched eyebrows, periorbital fullness,  epicanthal folds, broad nasal bridge, upturned nose, deep philtrum . His  extremities are relatively short with short fingers, he also has hypoplastic genitalia.

The syndrome could also comprise autistic features, seizures or thermore gulation problems. Rare symtoms are hearing loss, genitourinary anomalies and congenital heart defect. Extremely rare is association of Phelan McDer   mid syndrome and hepatic failure in early childhood. There have been de  scribed only 2 patients with this condition so far. In these cases PIM3 gene  (localized in 22q13.33) was considered to be responsible. We present 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with Phelan McDermid syn drome. Age at diagnosis ranges from 10 month to 55 years and deletion ex   tent varies from 0.4 Mb to 7.6 Mb. All patients present common features  of the syndrome, but they differ in inconstant sypmtoms. Any correlations  between phenotype and deletion range havenâ²t been observed.Patients have been diagnosed using FISH and MLPA, deletion extents were  proven by oligonucleotide arrayCGH. There are 6 patients with deleted PIM3 gene in our group, including two adult patients, but only one of these patients (10 year old boy with 1.9 Mb  long deletion) has developed hepatic failure recently. Therefore simple PIM3  deletion doesnâ²t seem to be the cause of hepatic failure.The possible mechanism is an alteration of the gene on the other allele, epi genetic factors or mutation in some modifier genes.

One  of those is mental retardation (MR) with developmental delay with an esti  mated prevalence of 2 3% in the general population. Application of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to clinical practice,  unraveled genetic aberration in MR patients with normal constitutional ka  ryotype. Here we report a five year old girl with mental and motor retarda  tion, epilepsy, and dysmorphic findings with normal constitutional karyo  type. To determine the genetic contribution in the development of clinical findings, aCGH analysis was performed. Roche NimbleGen Human CGH ISCA  Plus 3x1.4M Array was used for aCGH analysis. The data were analyzed by  using Nexus6 software (BioDiscovery). As a result of aCGH analysis, 5 chro mosomal regions were marked as important regions. Among these regions, one of them has been found to be related with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, previously. Microdeletion in the PTCHD1 locus on  Xp22.11 has been has been found in autism spectrum patients but not in he alty controls. However, we found a 24.3kb copy gain in the same locus in our patient. This finding showed that PTCHD1 locus may not be disrupted with  deletion only, copy gain in that region might also have effect on the gene, and its function. Also, other identified copy gains and loss may have contributed to the accompanying dysmorphic findings. As we experienced in the current patient, array CGH analysis is a valuable tool in uncovering submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements.  Y.K. Terzi: None. F.I. Sahin:  None. Z. Yilmaz Celik: None.

The key features are childhood obesi   ty, blindness due to congenital retinal dystrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Associated endocrinologic features include hyperinsulinemia, early onset type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, AS shares several features with the common metabolic syndrome, namely obesity, hyperinsu   linemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Mutations in the ALMS1 gene have been  found to be causative for AS. ALMS1 protein localizes to the basal bodies of cilia and plays an unknown role in intracellular trafficking.CASE REPORT: We describe the case of two brothers of 13 year old (male)  and 11 year old (female) born to unrelated healthy spanish parents. Both patients were attended in the Paediatric Service with a diagnosis of Alstrom  syndrome. Boy had hypothyroidism, acanthosis nigricans and hepatosple  nomegaly. He had normoacusia in the limit. The child also gave a history of  photophobia with nystagmus along with 100% visual disability. The patient  also had secondary metabolic myopathy which involved the proximal mus cles and kyphosis. Girl had hypothyroidism, dyslipemia, hypoacusia and di lated caridomiopathy. As her brother, she was blind (100%) and had a histo  ry of photophobia with nistagmus. Both brothers had a progressive cronic  nephropathy and central obesity. Genetic analysis showed that both were  carriers of two heterozygous ALMS1 mutations: c.5145T>G; p.Tyr1715X and  c.4268T>A; p.Leu1423X. Both mutations cause a truncated protein and had been described previously in literature. Diagnosis of Alstrom Syndrome can  be difficult because some features begin at birth and others emerge as the  child develops and phenotype is family dependent.  G. Pi:  None. J. Marshall: None. M.

1474,620,Diagnosis and management of Bohring Opitz Syndrome with or without ASXL1 mutations,P05.036,,"We define the characteristic features and management for Bohring Opitz  Syndrome (BOS), a rare genetic condition characterized by distinctive facial features, characteristic posture, microcephaly, severe intellectual disability and feeding problems. Since being initially delineated in 1999, there are now approximately 30 published cases. In 2011, Hoischen et al. identified de novo  nonsense mutations in ASXL1 in 7 out of 13 patients with BOS. Previously,  somatic mutations in ASXL1 have been detected in myeloid malignancies,  suggesting ASXL1 might be involved in tumor suppression. We report natu   ral history from 3 previously unpublished patients with BOS, including the first known case of BOS with bilateral Wilms tumors. All 3 patients had no vel de novo frameshift mutations in ASXL1, and 2 patients are normocephalic  with varied feeding issues and distinctive personalities (interactive, happy, and curious). Surviving patients with BOS may have a risk for tumors, and 2 previous patients with BOS had neoplasms. One patient with BOS died at 5 months with bilateral nephroblastomatosis, and another patient with BOS developed medulloblastoma at age 5 years; neither had mutations in ASXL1.  With a malignancy potential for BOS, tumor surveillance should be conside   red in patients with and without ASXL1 mutations for disease monitoring  and management. Diagnostic criteria may also need to be broadened to help identify previously undiagnosed cases. We review these 3 new cases and compare them with previous cases of BOS with and without mutations in ASXL1, and also with patients with mutations in ASXL3, to broaden diagno  stic criteria and suggest a tumor surveillance protocol.

1480,648, BKCa channels: a new therapeutic target in Fragile X Syndrome treatment,P05.067,,"The most common cause of inherited mental deficiency (MD) associated  with autistic features, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), results from the FMR1 gene  silencing and loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among synaptic proteins deregulated by the absence of Fmrp in fmr1  knock out  (KO) mice (murine model for FXS), Kcnma1 (Î± subunit of large conductance Ca 2+ activated potassium channels, BKCa) seems to be the most significant  deregulated one. Since several papers showed an involvement of BKCa chan nels in MD, this channel could be a new therapeutic target for FXS. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the molecular BKCa channel anomaly in fmr1  KO mouse model and 2) to evaluate the thera  peutic effect of a BKCa channel opener molecule (BCOM), BMS 204352, on dendritic spines maturation of fmr1  KO neurons and on social behavior of  fmr1  KO mice. In fmr1  KO mice, Kcnma1 protein quantity was lower in ce  rebral structures and neurons, and associated with a reduced BKCa whole cell current. In vitro addition of BMS 204352 induced dendrite spines ma  turation of fmr1  KO neurons. In vivo, using a behavioral test of direct social  interaction, a single injection of BMS 204352 rescued affiliative behaviors to wild type level. In conclusion, we demonstrated 1) a Kcnma1 protein anomaly in fmr1  KO  mice inducing a decrease in BKCa whole cell current, and 2) that a BCOM, BMS 204352, restored a regular phenotype of dendrite spines and social interaction in fmr1  KO mice. Therefore, BKCa channel could be a new thera  peutic target in FXS treatment.  B. Hebert: None. O. Perche: None. A. Menuet: None. N. Doisne: None. J. Pichon:  None. B. Laudier: None. S.

The clinical features of PMS (also known  as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and otherdevelopmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmor   phic features. Other less frequent features include seizures, brain, renal and cardiac malformations, motor deficits, and lymphedema Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, Clinical expression also varies widely, even among patients with small deletions, and no correlation between deletion size and phenotype has been found. A role for additional genetic factors, in addition to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, is likely. Because PMS is considered  to be underdiagnosed, the true prevalence is unknown. Aims. We aim to define a possible genotype phenotype comparison to use  high resolution deletion breakpoint mapping on a large cohort of patients, addressed the hypothesis that additional genes or regions of chromosome  22q13 besides SHANK3 may contribute to the PMS phenotype. Results. Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for more than 50  individuals in a patient cohort using a custom designed high resolution oli  gonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform, prompting  this genotype phenotype association study. Most of them have been studied by FISH, MLPA and array CGH and their clinical features have been defined.  Interestingly, a great genetic variability, with deletion sizes between 10 Kb  and as much as 9 MB was found.Conclusions. Preliminary data from this large cohort (first, with Spanish patients) were presented and may it provide additional data on genotype  phenotype hypothesis.  J. Nevado: None. M. Palomares:  None. F.

We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p.Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family. A functional test of HUWE1   activity on DNA repair is currently performed on patientâs cells to confirm its pathogenicity.  Y. Alembik: None. J. Lauer Zillhardt:  None. B. Gerard: None. C.

MedykÃ³w 18,,  Katowice, Poland. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation respon   sible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1  gene resulting in its transcriptional silencing. Leptin may be  considered a cytokine like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, immune system, in addition to its role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. Thus, we hypothesized on in volvement of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of autism.Material and methods23 male patients, mean age 19,3 Â± 6,6, affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1  gene), were enrolled into the study. Controls were 24  healthy males, mean age 21,8 Â± 5,8. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA method.ResultsPlasma leptin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients were similar as in con trol group (11,53 Â± 10,24 ng/ml) vs (5,73 Â± 4,52) were not significantly dif   ferent from those found in controls (p , 0,5).While plasma adiponectin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients (6,68 Â± 3,44 ng/ml) were significantly lower in controls (8,95 Â± 4,24) (p< 0,04).ConclusionAdiponectin may be involved in autistic features observed in FXS patients in light of its anti inflammatory properties.

The phenotype includes:  slight facial features including bulbous nasal tip, wide mouth, overfolded helix, strabismus, moderate intellectual disability (ID) with speech impedi   ment, hypotonia, hyperactivity, mood disorder with aggressive behaviour, neonatal feeding difficulties followed by a tendency to hyperphagia with overweight and a prominent abdomen with thick panniculus adiposus. Par  tial deletions of chromosome band 2p25.3 encompassing the MYT1L gene  have been reported in patients presenting with ID and overweight whereas  duplications disrupting the MYT1L gene have been reported in patients pre  senting with autism and schizophrenia. Moreover, single nucleotide poly   morphisms (SNPs) of MYT1L contribute to major depressive disorder and  schizophrenia. Recently, de Ligt et al. reported a âde novoâ splice site mu tation of the MYT1L gene identified by exome sequencing in a patient with  severe ID, autistic features, neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, as well as mild facial features.This report and previous publications strongly suggest that alterations of  the MYT1L gene are responsible for diverse neuropsychiatric disorders with  intellectual disability and a tendency to overweight.

1496,693, Alteration in synaptic genes NRXN1 and NLGN4 may predispose to neurological syndromes,P05.113,,"Neurexins and neuroligins are proteins functionally connected by interac tion in synaptic network formation and maitenance. According to recent studies alteration in NRXN1 (2p16.3) and NLGN4 (Xp22.3) genes can pre  dispose to the wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including autistic spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, speech and language de   lay, hypotonia and schizophrenia. NRXN1 as one of the largest known human  genes (1,1 Mb) tends to frequent intragenic alterations. Whole genome ge notyping was performed using the Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1.We present 3 children of comparable age (5 6 year old), having different size of microdeletion in isoform alpha1 NRXN1 gene (40   360 kb ) and slightly  different phenotype. All children had mild to moderate mental retardation, two of them had speech delay and anxiosity, hypotonia and facial dysmor   phism. Two of detected deletions were intronic, the third deletion covered exones 1 to 11 of NRXN1. As the deletion in the NRXN1 may not be fully  penetrant, we examine also parental DNA.Microduplication (300 kb) spanning the exones 1,2 and 3 of NLGN4 gene  was found in 22 year old patient with hyperkinetic syndrome, attention failure, but without mental retardation. The same duplication was detected in clinically normal mother and maternal cousin with Asperger syndrome. Thanks to this family examination prenatal array diagnosis in a new preg nancy could be provided. Consequently probandÂ´s brother without duplica   tion in NLGN4 was born.  V. Becvarova:  None. L.

It is characterized by developmental regression, acquired mi crocephaly, loss of purposeful hand use and speech, stereotypic hand mo vements, autistic features, gait apraxia, breathing anomalies, and seizures. Mutations in other genes have been identified in early onset seizure variant (CDKL5) and congenital variant (FOXG1) of Rett syndrome. We report the results of molecular analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 genes in patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features from Czech Republic.MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing of coding regions and exon/intron boundaries. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions in all three genes were analy   zed by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification.We identified MECP2 mutations in 65 out of 86 patients with classic Rett syndrome (76%). 20 patients with Rett syndrome variants were initially screened for MECP2 mutations and 6 MECP2 mutations were identified (30%). The subsequent analysis of CDKL5 gene in patients with early onset seizure variant revealed mutations in 2 cases (6,7%). No mutation has been identified in FOXG1 gene in the patients with congenital variant of Rett syn drome.We confirmed the high frequency of MECP2 mutations in classic Rett syn ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 186Back to index drome.

1501,706, Characterization of novel âde novoâ mutation in the SLC6A8 gene,P05.127,,"Introduction: Cerebral creatine deficiency is an X linked disorder caused by mutations in the SLC6A8  gene (Xq28). It consists of 13 exons and encodes a  protein of 635 amino acids. This disorder causes an increase of creatine le vels in urine and plasma, and urinary creatine/creatinine ratio. The clinical presentation of males affected is mental retardation, expressive speech and language delay, epilepsy, developmental delay and autistic behaviour.Subjects and Methods: An 8 year old male patient presents learning diffi   culties, behaviour disorder and epilepsy. An increase of creatine/creatinine ratio, guanidineacetate and glycine levels (plasma and urine) was detected. The 13 exons of the SLC6A8 gene, including the intron exon junctions, were  analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction.Results: We detected a 34 pb deletion (c.1016+11_1017 52del34) in intron 6, that was predicted to cause an aberrant splicing into acceptor splice site. At the cDNA level, this mutation produces a 30 pb deletion in exon 7 and a single amino acid insertion (p. K339_S349delinsN). This variant was not detected in the mother and is therefore considered de novo.Discussion: DNA and RNA analysis were necessary to characterize this novel pathogenic mutation. The detected change in the creatine transporter could be responsible for a lower and/or no activity of the protein. Functional stu dies in cultured skin fibroblasts will be necessary to show  a deficiency of the  creatine transporter function.   J. Aguirre Lamban: None. C. Cervera Acedo:  None. E. Sarasola: None.

1505,729,"CNV characterization, inheritance and phenotypic correlations in families with autism",P06.06,,"In this study, we characterized potentially pathogenic CNVs in a sample of 342 Portuguese children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), geno typed by the Autism Genome Project whole genome CNV analysis. We selec ted high confidence CNVs (detected by 3 algorithms) not overlapping more than 20% with CNVs in 8000 controls.We identified 165 CNVs in 132 individuals, 78% with only one CNV. CNVs ranged from 5 kb to 3 Mb, and 67% were deletions. However, genic CNVs, which represented 53% of all CNVs, were more frequently duplications (65%). Genic CNVs integrated between 1 and 17 genes, and included genes implicated in ASD etiology like NRXN1 and CHD2, as well as novel genes.  CNVs were mainly inherited, with only 10% de novo. We further evaluated the presence of autistic traits in parents, using appro priate questionnaires, and the type of inheritance of the CNV (inherited vs  de novo). We observed a significant excess of autistic traits in the fathers  that transmitted CNVs, mainly for the âaloofâ personality, defined as lak   king interest in social interaction. Analysis of familial correlation data from  parents and probands showed a significant correlation between parents.

1506,730,Missing heritability of Korean patient with autism spectrum disorder(ASD),P06.07,,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have been identified SNPs asso   ciated with complex traits. However, a great deal of the heritable variation associated with common traits remains unaccounted for within the geno me. The objective of this study is to discover large parts of additive gene tic variance not typically associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through GWAS in Korean population and estimates of ASD heritability.Subjects with ASD were recruited through the Korean Autism Genetic Study Consortium. Each child was diagnosed as ASD by using the Korean versions of ADOS and ADI R (Lord et al. 1994; Lord et al. 1997).Total 146 patients were genotyped on the Affymetrix 5.0 platform. Geno   type data for n,858 sex matched controls were drawn from the Korea As sociation Resource database. Genotype data were filtered for <5% missing   ness/sample or /SNP; MAF >0.01; HWE p>0.0001. Cases were verified as unrelated using identity by descent estimation in PLINK v1.07. In order to examine the missing heritability in ASD, we applied genome wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) to 142 case and 842 controls after data filtering.The results identified phenotypic variants of 84.5% (Â±0.313 SE) with affec ted status of ASD, 7.0% (Â±0.027 SE) with topGWAS SNPs (Â± 1mb region) and 81.0%(Â± 0.313 SE) with nonGWAS SNPs. Increase from the genetic variance identified by top GWAS hits region indicates there might be more risk loci to be identified. Our results suggest that many common variants of small effect remain to be discovered, although GWAS is useful in identifying the most common variants associated with ASD.  J.E. Park: None. S.A.

On the other hand, the con  tribution of non heritable genomic alterations to the pathogenesis is hardly  appreciated. Here, we have assessed post zygotic autosomal aneuploidy in prefrontal cortex of the diseased and normal brain by molecular cytogenetic  techniques (FISH and interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding  with DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18). Twel  ve autistic, 19 schizophrenic and 27 control samples provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental disorders, University of Maryland and bank of our institute were analyzed. Aneuploidy rate per autosome was 0.3  0.8% in all three cohorts analyzed (0.46%, 0.62% and 0.59%). However, we  observed statistically significant increase of chromosome 9 aneuploidy in  the autistic brain. In schizophrenia, chromosome 1 and 18 aneuploidy rates were significantly increased. Additionally, we performed array CGH and in silico analysis of our data on genomic rearrangements in childhood neuro  developmental diseases (124 individuals) and found that CNV burdens in  these individuals typically affect two pathways specific for brain cells: cell  cycle regulation and programmed cell death. We concluded that somatic genome variation (chromosome specific mosaic aneuploidy) is a non heri   table genetic factor contributing to pathogenesis of brain disorders, that is,  however, a result of specific CNV burdens.

While it is well esta blished that de novo genetic variation plays an important role in ASD risk, recent studies have demonstrated a convincing evidence of a rare recessive contribution to the heritability of ASDs.In the genome wide CNV study carried out by the Autism Genetic Consorti   um (AGP), we identified one homozygous deletion intersecting the CTNNA3 gene in an Italian proband with ASD and moderate intellectual disability (PIQ,50). This deletion includes a coding exon, leading to a putative frames hift and premature stop codon, inherited from both parents, each heterozy   gote for a deletion of slightly different length. The unaffected sister is also heterozygote for the deletion.CTNNA3 encodes for the alfaT catenin protein that has a crucial role in cel lular adherence showing suggestive association in GWAS and a de novo de   letion.Even if the frequency of exonic deletions of CTNNA3 is not significantly dif   ferent between ASDs cases and controls (17/2446 cases and 35/5097 con trols, P,.88), no homozygous exonic deletions were found in a sample of  5097 controls, suggesting that only the complete knockout of CTNNA3 could  cause or confer susceptibility for ASDs.

1524,765,Identification of a genomic homozygous deletion of ZNF277 in a child with SLI,P06.48,,"Specific language impairment (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental dis   order in which language abilities are below age expectations, in the absence  of explanatory environmental or medical conditions, such as hearing loss,  intellectual disability or autism. SLI affects 3 7% of English speaking pre  school children. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277   gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex   pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L   genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autistic spectrum dis   orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277  deletions. We observed  an increased frequency of ZNF277  deletions in probands with SLI (6/318,  1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen   dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277  in lymphoblastoid cell lines car  rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found  that, while ZNF277  microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do  not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi  crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 . Given these fin  dings, we postulate that ZNF277  microdeletions may contribute to the risk  of speech and language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risks previously described in this region.

1525,769,Deletion of UBE3A gene in brothers with Angelman syndrome close to breakpoint of inversion at 15q11.2 and 15q26.1,P07.03,,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe intellectual disability  with major speech impairment, ataxia and behavioral uniqueness. The un  derlining molecular deficit is the failure of maternal copy of the imprinted  UBE3A gene due to maternal deletions, the most common present in 70 75%  of case, which is detected by FISH of the UBE3A region. Only a small number of intragenic or whole genomic microdeletions of UBE3A have been repor   ted. We report on two brothers with AS with microdeletion of 15q11.2 q12  emcompassing UBE3A gene, close to breakpoint of inversion at 15q11.2 and  15q26.1. The brothers were the first and second children of unrelated and  healthy parents. They were born at term after uneventful pregnancy. Patient  1 (older brother) had developmental delay, walked with ataxic gait, and did not speak word at 6 years old. He developed seizure at 4 years old. Patient  2 (younger brother) had also developmental delay and started sitting at 15  months. They had mild phenotype and behavior of AS. Karyotype revealed  pericentric inversion of 15q and FISH test revealed deletion of UBE3A re  gion. Array CGH revealed 467kb deletion at 15q11.2 q12, only emcompas sing UBE3A and a part of SNORD115, and 53kb deletion at 15q26.1. Their  mother revealed normal karyoptype and no deletion of 15q11.2 q12 with  array CGH, so we assumed germline mosaicism. This report is a rare familial  case with AS detected by routine FISH test.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous  disease characterized by degeneration of lower motor neurons. The most  frequent form is linked to mutations of the SMN1. Childhood SMA associated  with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA PME) has been reported as a rare autosomal recessive condition unlinked to SMN1 mutation. Through  linkage analysis, homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in three un  related SMA PME families, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.125C>T; p.Thr42Met) in the ASAH1 exon 2 in affected children of two fa milies and the same mutation associated with a deletion of the whole gene  in the third one. Expression studies of the c.125C>T mutant cDNA in Farber  fibroblasts showed an acid ceramidase activity deficiency of 32% of that ge nerated by normal cDNA. More recently, two additional living patients were  analyzed: identical ASAH1 mutation was found leading to reduction of acid  ceramidase activity (17 20 % of the control value ) in patient fibroblasts.

Morpholino knockdown of ASAH1 ortholog in zebrafish led to a marked loss  of motor neuron axonal branching associated with increased apoptosis in the spinal cord.

1529,843,Genomics of FXT AS (Fragile X associated Tremor Ataxia) mouse brains reveals hallmarks of altered neurodevelopmement and neurodegeneration.,P08.43,,"While FMR1 is silenced in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients carrying the full mutation, its expression is elevated (2 8 fold) in premutated individuals. The se subjects may develop the Fragile X associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and parkinsonism. In addition, people carrying the premutation can be affected by a set of neurological and behavioural disorders during young age. Memory problems have been detected in these patients as well as in the mouse mo del for FXTAS. In those animals, by transcriptome analysis we have shown a profound deregulation of the expression levels of genes involved in learning, memory and autistic behavior, Parkinson disease and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest the presence of a synapthopathy (Zongaro et al., HMG, 2013). Furthermore, we studied gene expression profiles of whole brain ob tained from both young and old FXTAS mice. We observed that in this context different neurodegenerative pathways are involved at different ages. In FXTAS mice, we also studied the expression level of several microRNAs that target FMR1 mRNA and we observed that one them, miR 221, is down regulated  at the synapse of young FXTAS mice and in the full brain of the older ones.  Interestingly, many of those deregulated mRNAs at the synapse, as well as in whole brain, are target of miR 221. These findings suggest a network regula  tion   including miRNAs and mRNAs  for FMR1 mRNA.  S. Zongaro: None. R. Hukema: None. R. Willemsen: None. B. Mari: None. B.  Bardoni: None.",2013.0,,"S.

The use of array CGH substantially improves the diagnosis of chromosomal  abnormalities that are not evident by conventional karyotype. Recently in an extended family with global developmental delay and autistic features,  a novel Xq12 q13.3 duplication was identified which contained amongst  others TAF1, GJB1 genes .(Kaya et al.2012).The GJB1 gene is associated with  morphology of myelin sheath and peripheral neuropathy, while TAF1  has  been linked with torsion dystonia  3.

The first one is a 5 year old boy with truncal hy   potonia, low deep tendon reflexes and proximal weakness. The other pati   ent is a 16 year old boy with progressive difficulties in walking, tremor and  learning disorder, while his mother has an identical positive family history in three deceased males. High resolution 4X180K Agilent arrays used in the  study (> 236.000 probes, average resolution of 8.9 Kb) revealed a duplicati   on on Xq13.1 (0.423 Mb) containing the TAF1 and GJB1 genes in both pati   ents, while the second patient had an additional deletion on 17q21.31 (0.63  Mb) containing KANSL1  gene.

Cryptic BCR/ABL1  rearrangements were reported in 5% of  CML patients, which are not visible under conventional cytogenetic analysis and so are detectable only with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Here we re port the case with this rare coincidence of coexistence of inv(16) and cryptic BCR/ABL1  rearrangement. A 65 year old man presented with leukocytosis  (18.2Ã10 9/L) with 72% blasts. Bone marrow blast cells showed cytogenetic  abnormality with 46,XY,inv(16)(p13.1q22)[15]/46,XY[5], and Philadelphia chromosomes were not found. Metaphase FISH detected both the CBFB and  the BCR/ABL1 rearrangements, located on chromosome 9. Additional FISH  study for BCR ABL1  ASS  gene showed no apparent deletion of flanking ma  terial of ASS gene on chromosome 9. These results prove that BCR/ABL1   fusion signal resulted from an insertional translocation from the small part of BCR gene on chromosome 22, to the proximal of ABL1  gene on chromo   some 9. CBFB/MYH11 (A type) and minor BCR/ABL1  (e1a2, P190) fusion  transcripts were both detected by real time quantitative RT PCR. The pati   ent was treated with standard AML chemotherapy.

We found 9861 genes with at least one significant cis eQTLs for fat, 10015 for LCL and 9243 for skin (FDR,10%). We also found that between 75% and 80% of the eQTLs are shared among two tissues and that 50% are shared by the three tissues.  RNA seq data allows the quantification of allele specific expression (ASE).  At a 10% FDR we observed that 9.5%, 9.3% and 9.1% of the heterozygous sites had a significant ASE effect in fat, LCL and skin. The observed ASE can  be caused by genetic or epigenetic /environmental factors. To quantify how  much variation in allelic expression is due to genetic factors we estimated the heritability of ASE ratios. We found a heritability of 42% for fat, 45% for LCL and 66% for skin, suggesting that epigenetic / environmental factors  have a substantial effect on allelic expression. We also observed that cis ge  netic effects explain just a fraction (68% in fat, 37% in lcl, and 44% in skin) of the total genetic effects, suggesting potential epistatic effects between  trans and cis genetic variants.

1621,1526,Rare Variant Extensions of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test Detects Associations with Autism Exome Sequence Data,P16.106,,"Many population based rare variant association tests have been developed to analyze sequence data. A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise   quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa   tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7  gene. Given  the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

1640,1811,A rare case of a complete 9p trisomy without autistic features and resulting from a de novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation,J02.03,,"Trisomy 9p is one of the most frequent autosomal anomalies compatible with long survival rate. The phenotype of the 9 p duplication syndrome is clinically recognizable, and phenotype/genotype correlations suggested that the critical region is located on 9p22. We report on a rare case of a tri somy for the whole short arm of chromosome 9 resulting from a de novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation. A 3 year old girl was referred to genetic counselling because of facial dysmorphism, seizures, and moderate mental retardation. MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) was interpreted as normal. Chromosome analysis revealed a 46,XX,der(15)add(15)(p11) karyotype. Parental karyotypes were normal. Thus, we conclude that this chromosomal rearrangement occurred de novo. In order to identify this additional materi   al on chromosome 15, we performed array CGH (Nimbelgen Whole genome tiling135K HG18) that showed a duplication of the whole short arm of chro mosome 9. No other imbalances were found elsewhere in the genome. FISH studies performed with whole chromosome 15 and chromosome 9 painting probes confirmed that the chromosomal material added on chromosome 15 derived from 9p. Our observation is unique because the duplication of the whole short arm of chromosome 9 without monosomy of another chromo some and resulting from a de novo unbalanced translocation was never re ported. Our patient had the most common clinical findings of the trisomy 9p syndrome but neither visceral anomalies, nor autistic features.

1648,1855,2q13.3 deletion syndrome in a newborn with ring chromosome 22 presenting with congenital hypotonia,J02.472,,"The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome or Phelan McDermid syndrome is characte rized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, absent to severely delayed speech, normal to accelerated growth with minor dismorphic fea tures such as dolichocephaly, large or unusual ears, long eye lashes, bulbous  nose, pointed chin, large hands and dysplastic toe nails. Most individuals  have moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic like beha viour and decreased pain perception. Frequency of the syndrome is equal in males and females while incidence is still unknown. Beside the simple de   letion, loss of 22q13.3 can also result from translocation, ring chromosome formation and other less common structural changes affecting the region containing SHANK3 gene on long arm of chromosome 22. The most features  of the syndrome thought to be the consequence of loss that specific gene. We present a case of female newborn with Phelan McDermid syndrome. The child was born on term, from first, uncomplicated pregnancy with un  remarkable family history. She was initially treated in NICU because of early  neonatal infection. Because of congenital hypotonia with mild facial dysmor   phic features genetic analysis were performed. The karyotype revealed ring  chromosome (22): 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13.3). A fluorescent in situ hybridisa   tion analysis was performed, indicating that the deletion encompassed the  critical 22q13.3 region.

Two cytochrome  P450 genes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, are involved in metabolization of psy   chotropic medications.The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*41, CYP2C19*2 alleles in the case and control groups, and progno stic assessment of risperidone therapy in association with defined alleles.Methods: Ninety five patients with ASD participated in the study. The con  trol group consisted of 190 healthy, non related individuals without ASD. CYP2C19*2, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*41 were genotyped by the TaqMan method. Allelesâ and haplotype frequency differences in case and control groups were compared by chi square (Ï 2) test. Frequency of adverse reactions and  therapy corrections were evaluated in the patient group.Results: Association with ASD pharmacotherapy was not found for the ha  plotypes CYP2D6*41C/T â CYP2D6*4C/T (p,0.4), therefore these cannot be safely used in the drug therapy prognostics. In the case group CYP2D6*41 allele T was observed more frequently than in the control group (p,0.01).The most common adverse drug reaction was hyperprolactinemia, the cau se of which may be associated with ASD neurotransmitter defects, and not with the primary phase of xenobiotic metabolism.

Methods: A 17 years old boy was evaluated in our neuropsychiatry department for a psychotic episode. Results: The adolescent was in a state of extreme agitation and presented auditory and visual hallucinations. Furthermore, he had persecution delirium, was highly suspicious and anxious and feared for his life. The symptoms appeared gra dually during the 3 weeks prior to admission. His medical history revealed he was previously diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and Asperger disorder. The physical examination was suggestive for the connective tissue disorder and otherwise unremarkable. The EEG didnât show abnormal electrical ac tivity, while a heart ultrasound confirmed a mildly dilated aortic bulb. He received antipsychotic and sedative treatment with a favorable outcome and remains in psychiatric follow up.

1689,2343,Validation of a commercially available mRNA reprogramming method for iPS cell generation.,J20.01,,"Since the pioneer work of Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2006, many methods have been reported on the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Most protocols rely on viral vector mediated transduction of repro gramming genes involving random insertions of exogenous sequences into the genome with insertional mutagenesis being a serious concern. Recently, a non integrating system has been reported to efficiently reprogram hu man BJ foreskin fibroblasts using synthetic mRNA trancripts encoding the Yamanaka factors. The mRNA method requires  the use of irradiated human  newborn foreskin fibroblasts (NuFF) as feeder cells. We evaluated the com mercially available mRNA reprogramming system (Stemgent) on human adult skin fibroblasts (ASF) using human BJ foreskin fibroblasts as positi ve control. For the required feeder cells, we used either irradiated NuFF or human fetal skin fibroblasts. Five mRNA encoding reprogramming factors (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, Lin28, c Myc) were delivered to the target cells via a lipid based vehicle (RNAiMAX, Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency for both ASF and BJ cells was about 50% positive cells.

We previously showed that increased dosage of methyl CpG binding prote  in 2 (MeCP2) leads to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder in males, desi   gnated as the MECP2 duplication syndrome (MIM#300260). The increased  dosage of MeCP2 is the result of a copy number gain at Xq28, including the MECP2 gene and results in severe to profound neurodevelopmental delay  with onset at birth, limited or absent speech, hypotonia, epilepsy, autistic  behavior and motor dysfunction. We developed induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome carrying different  duplication sizes, to study the impact of increased MePC2 dosage in human  neurons. Differentiation of these iPSCs into neurons of cortical identity sho   wed modulation in the expression of progenitor genes like BLBP and FOXG1  and cortical genes like RELN, CTIP2, TBR1  and VGLUT. Cortical neurons  derived from Mecp2dup iPSCs had more synapses, and altered network  synchronization as well as dendritic complexity. Next, we tested a series of epigenetic drugs for the ability to rescue neuronal defects and validated two HDAC inhibitors as potential clinical candidates.

In silico investigation is helpful to estimate a functional  relevance of mutations, but cannot substitute the functional analysis itself. To analyze the functional impact of the four selected mutations, we conduc ted overexpression and knockdown rescue experiments in primary hippo campal neurons from rat with a major focus on morphological changes of the neurons. Another major point of our study was to investigate the effect of different SHANK2 isoforms and schizophrenia mutations on the actin  structures. We used COS 7 cells as a model system and live cell TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy for imaging of actin structu res.

In patients without evocative syndromic forms the offer is limited to Fragile X testing and array CGH, leaving most cases undiagnosed. Trio Exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, but re mains costly for general implementation. We thus tested targeted exon se   quencing of 217 genes previously implicated in X linked ID, or in autosomal dominant or recessive forms in which ID is the major clinical concern. We analyzed 106 patients (mostly males and sporadic cases) with molecularly undiagnosed ID. One third of them harbored autistic features.We identified causative mutations in 26 patients: sixteen in X linked ge nes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD , FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1 , IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA,  MECP2, SLC9A6 , SLC16A2, PHF8), 10 de novo in autosomal genes (DYRK1A ,  GRIN1 , MED13L , TCF4, RAI1 , SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 ). We detected likely  causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3  for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge  nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit  more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions.

FRAXE is an X linked form of intellectual disability characterized by mild  to moderate cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic  behavior. The folate sensitive fragile site FRAXE is located in Xq28 appro  ximately 600 kb distal to the fragile X syndrome fragile site (FRAXA) and harbors an unstable GCC triplet repeat adjacent to a CpG island in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR  (untranslated region) of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. The disorder results from  amplification and methylation of the GCC repeats and consequence silen cing of AFF2. Although chromosome abnormalities (mostly deletions) that disrupt AFF2 have been reported with mild moderate intellectual disability,  microduplication of Xq28 that partially involved AFF2 has not been descri   bed as a potential cause of FRAXE. We performed clinical and molecular cha  racterization of patient with 301 kb interstitial de novo duplication at Xq28 (chrX:147ÃÂ490ÃÂ437 147ÃÂ791ÃÂ737bp)(GRCh37/hg19). This genomic mutati   on leads to the duplication of part of 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR region of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene which could be inactivated due to this genomic change. Namely, duplication of this segment potentially could have the same effects as amplification and  methylation of an unstable GCC triplet repeats. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are perfor   ming experiments aimed to study genic expression/metilation. As our pati   ent had cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity and mild dysmor   phism, we predict that partial duplication of AFF2 in our patient could be  the cause of his phenotype.",2014.0,,"N.

Foundation, Milano, Italy. In 2012 Kaya et al. reported three related patients with a recurrent dupli cation Xq12 q13.3 with mental retardation, autism, seizures and dysmor   phic features. The duplicated region (9.4 Mb) contains numerous genes and the authors pointed out the possible role of an increased dosage of specific genes focusing on their presumed role in developmental delay and autism. Subsequent reports (Prontera et al. 2012; Wentz et al. 2013) described 4 more patients with a variable association of severe global developmental delay, microcephaly, dysmorphism and autism spectrum disorder, all car rying a duplication in the Xq12 q13.3 region, supporting the existence of a clinically recognizable X linked recessive disorder. We describe a further patient affected by global developmental delay, epilepsy, autistic traits and carrying two non contiguous duplications detected by array CGH, involving Xq12 and Xq13 regions. Detailed clinical description is provided and com pared to previous reported cases. Due to the narrowed size of the duplicated regions (123 Kb and 509 Kb, respectively), this case helps to redefine the region of interest for this condition. The two duplications in our patients involve 13 genes, and 7 of them are mainly expressed in the nervous sy   stem (OPHN1, SNX12, MED12, NLGN3, GJB1, ZMYM3, TAF1) and all, except for SNX12, are involved in the pathogenesis of a known human disease.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients.

The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU.

Statistically significant opposite transmission  patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression  and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite  alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi  nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG)  activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autistic disorder in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014.0,,"I.

We replicated this genetic association in an Italian population (409 cases, 723 controls), identifying a protective signal, corresponding to a GCC mi  crosatellite in the PRKCA promoter (P,0.033, OR,0.12, 95%CI,0.015 0.94),  and a risk haplotype in intron 3 (P,7.7*10 4; OR,1.57, 95%CI,1.24 1.99, meta analysis P,1.1*10 12). Expression experiments demonstrated that the protective signal is associated with PRKCA promoter variants confer   ring higher expression levels of the gene. Minigene based transfection ex   periments proved that the risk signal is driven by an ins/del polymorphism (rs35476409/rs61762387) influencing, with an hnRNP H dependent me  chanism, the skipping of a PRKCA alternative exon. Studies performed on RNA extracted from different cell lines and human tissues evidenced a complex pattern of alternatively spliced (AS) PRKCA  isoforms, which are modulated by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay  (NMD) and display a preferential association with the use of alternative po lyadenilation sites.MS patients showed significantly decreased PRKCA levels (49 cases, 61  controls; P<1*10 4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a conco   mitant unbalance in the relative abundance of its mRNA variants. One of  these alternative transcripts is predicted to encode a truncated PKCÃÂ± that, when overexpressed, aberrantly localizes to the plasma membrane and/or  in cytoplasmic clusters.

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autistic spectrum. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndromes in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval.Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan   ces.

1799,858, S The role of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor in epileptogenesis,P09.105,,"NMDA receptors are tetrameric ligand gated ion channels composed of two glycine binding NR1 subunits and two glutamate binding NR2 subunits (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) regulating synaptic plasticity. Mutations in the NR2A and NR2B subunits encoded by the genes GRIN2A  and GRIN2B  have  been associated with different phenotypes of intellectual disability (ID). Mutations in GRIN2A  were known to cause unspecific ID and epilepsy as  well as other neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas mutations in GRIN2B have mainly been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but not seizures. We show for the first time that mutations of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor cause different and specific epilepsy phenotypes. NR2 muta   tions are involved in benign Rolandic epilepsy, the most frequent childhood epilepsy as well as in a variety of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathi es, such as Landau Kleffner and West syndrome. Furthermore, we demon   strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign  Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre  sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations.

In available control databases, deletions of segments from exons 1 to intron 4 as well as intron 9 were recurrent, but only 1/4139 controls had a CNV overlapping exon 6,  suggesting a pathogenic role of deletions in this region. The smaller exon  6 CNVs deleted a functional domain SYT11 binding site, compromising the  attachment of synaptotagmin and ubiquitination.These results support a role of PARK2 structural variants in ASD.

Over the past years, the convergence of genomic technologies has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci by means of linkage stu dies. Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. Recently, a role of potassium inward rectifying channels in the pathogenesis of autism disease has been postu lated due to the identification in patients affected by autism and epilepsy of two mutations in the KCNJ10 gene. The gene encodes the Kir4.1 channel which is expressed in astrocytes and neurons.We then searched for mutati   on in the KNCJ10 gene, as well as in two genes (KCNJ2 and KCNJ16) coding for additional Kir channels with reported expression in astrocytes and neu rons, in two unrelated patients. We detected a new mutation in the KCNJ2 gene in a boy affected by autism. The mutation has been detected also in the healthy father and in the paternal grandmother who reported a case of SIDS (Sudden Infant death Syndrome) in her family.

The use of high resolution array based comparative genomic hybridiza   tion (array CGH) in whole genome investigation led to an unprecedented rate of discovery of clinically relevant microdeletions/microduplications in neurodevelopmental disorders. We report on a 12 year old boy with facial dysmorphic features, autism (Asperger syndrome), motor and vocal tics, speech disorder in early childhood presenting a 9q34.11   q34.12 deletion. Cytogenetic investigations included array CGH investigation (105K plat   form, Agilent Technologies) and FISH (BAC probes). Array CGH revealed a de novo 2.4 Mb deletion spanning cytogenetic bands 9q34.11 q34.12 (geno mic coordinates, hg19: 131485878 133931680). Approximately 50 genes are located within the deleted region, some of these being disease causing OMIM genes: AGM5, CDG1M, TOR1A, ASS1, ABL1. Deletions of genomic re gion 9q34.11 q34.13, proximal to EHMT1, are rarely described. Few pati   ents with deletions similar to our case have been reported in the literature and centralized in databases (e.g. DECIPHER). Haploinsufficiency of genes located in this region might be responsible for the clinical findings in the reported patients (such as autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, move ment disorders etc). Thus our case adds to the body of knowledge and will help in establishing genotype phenotype correlations.

Several biological pathways have been high lighted, particularly the excitatory synapse, affected by copy number varia tions (CNV) and enrichment in mutations in genes belonging to the NMDA  receptor complex (NRC). We performed a global genetic study of 100 French  families including at least 1 individual with autism, who were included in the research project (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).Our project aimed to evaluate both the contribution of CNV in ASD, and  secondly the presence of mutations in the NRC complex. For each family,  we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array format to identify  rare or de novo CNVs. In parallel, a high throughput targeted sequencing of  216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex (179) was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene  mutations in our cohort. The first results of our study allowed us to characterize candidates and li kely pathogens genetic alterations in at least 10% of patient. We have found mutations or CNV in genes encoding receptors (NLGN4X, GRM5 ), and in cy   tosolic (UPF3B), nuclear (MACROD2), and synaptic (NXPH3) proteins.

1995,84, Non invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening an ESHG/ASHG position statement,C01.6,,"Several professional societies have issued position statements on noninvasi ve testing (NIPT) in prenatal screening for common autosomal aneuploidies. Ethical aspects have not been a main focus of those statements. This ESHG/ASHG document fills this lacuna. Emerging scenarios for introducing NIPT into prenatal screening should not just be regarded as a matter of screening technology and health economics; the question is also how the trade offs involved enable or impede meaningful reproductive choices and how they affect the balance of benefits and burdens for pregnant women and their partners. With improving screening technologies and decreasing costs of sequencing and analysis, it will become technically possible to expand the scope of prenatal screening beyond common autosomal aneuploidies. This should be limited to serious congenital and childhood disorders, and only following sound validation studies and a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant aspects. In countries where prenatal screening for fetal abnormali   ties is offered as a public health programme, governments and public health authorities should adopt a more active role to ensure the responsible inno vation of prenatal screening on the basis of ethical principles. This requires guarantees of the quality of the screening process as a whole (including non laboratory aspects such as information and counseling), education of professionals, systematic evaluation in the light of the aim of the practice, accountability to all stakeholders and promotion of equity of access.

2019,156," Chromosomal contacts connect loci associated with autism, BMI and head circumference phenotypes",C13.3,,"We identified the cis  and trans acting long range chromosomal contacts of five genes located within the 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 copy number variants (CNVs). Its deletion is one of the most frequent known etiologies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while this deletion and reciprocal duplication are associated with mirror phenotypes on BMI, head circumference and brain volume. We observed complex chromatin looping between genes located in the proximal 600kb BP4 BP5 and those mapping to the distal 16p11.2 220kb BP2 BP3 region, two loci separated by 650kb, successfully confir   med by reciprocal 4C, FISH, Hi C and associations between active regula   tory regions. Phenotyping of 137 unrelated carriers of distal 16p11.2 220 kb BP2 BP3 deletion and duplication showed that these CNVs are similarly associated with ASD and reciprocal impacts on BMI and HC.Our results indicate that chromosomal contactsÃ¢ÂÂ maps could uncover func tionally and clinically related genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, loci chromatin contacted by our selected viewpoints are enriched for ASD genes (OR,2.15, P,1.65e 08). Furthermore, we uncovered 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 chromatin loops with (i) the 1q21.1 cytoband, whose deletions and du plications were previously linked to micro  and macrocephaly, respectively; (ii) PTEN, mutations of which are associated with a macrocephalic form of ASD; and (iii) the 2p15 cytoband. We enrolled 35 carriers of 2p15 16.1 de   letion and duplication and showed that they similarly display mirror pheno types on HC and weight.Finally, we observe that genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 BP4 BP5 CNV carriers are concomitantly modified in their chromatin interactions, suggesting that disruption of chromatin interplays participates in the ob   served phenotypes.

2032,204, ST AG1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for a new cohesinopathy with intellectual disability and characteristic facial features in four unrelated individuals,C21.2,,"Cohesinopathies are rare disorders arising from a dysfunction in the cohesin  pathway, which enables chromosome segregation and proper cell division.  So far, seven genes from this pathway have been reported in human disease.  Five of them are involved in autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X linked (SMC1A and HDAC8) Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and two of them  in autosomal recessive Roberts (ESCO2) and Warsaw Breakage syndromes  (DDX11). All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which,  along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3  males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel  lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency. Three had history of intrauterine growth retardation, two with prenatal onset  microcephaly, one with post natal growth retardation. One individual had  epilepsy, two had autistic features. The four patients shared common facial features, with widely spaced incisors, thin eyebrows, and high nasal bridge. The mechanism for haploinsufficiency was a small deletion encompassing  STAG1 diagnosed by array CGH in two individuals, an intragenic deletion in  STAG1 found by whole genome analysis in one individual, and a missense heterozygous mutation (c.641A>G) revealed by exome analysis in the last patient.

The mo  noallelic maternal expression of CDKN1C is under the control of the IC2  imprinting centre through the antisense non coding KCNQ1OT1 transcript. The protein comprises three functional domains including from the N  to the C terminus a CDK binding, a PAPA and a PCNA domain. CDKN1C mutations underlie the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) ac  counting for 10% of sporadic cases and up to 40% of familial cases. Here we report on the clinical and molecular characterization of ten BWS  families, negative for the known 11p15 (epi)genetic alterations and 2 prena tal cases diagnosed because of omphalocele.

The disease is genetically heterogeneous and associated with mutations in type IV collagen that forms a distinct network in the glomerular basement mem brane (GBM). Fifteen percent of patients with AS have autosomal recessive inheritance caused by pathogenic mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes, located in 2q36 37.Subjects and methodsGenetic analysis was performed on a 28 year old male patient who had, since the age of 3 years old, presented nephrotic syndrome and persistent microhematuria. He fulfilled four of the AS clinical diagnostic criteria: a po sitive family history of hematuria, proteinuria, hearing loss, and typical elec tron microscopy abnormalities of the GBM. The entire coding sequence and flanking intronic regions of the COL4A3/A4 genes were analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction. Afterwards, sixteen members of his family (8 males and 8 females) were included in the analysis.ResultsA novel heterozygous mutation (c.

2136,581, Acid ceramidase deficiency: clinical implications of an emerging spectrum and potential therapies,PS06.13,,"Sinai, New York, NY, United States. Mutations in the ASAH1 gene lead to acid ceramidase deficiency, the resul tant accumulation of the lipid ceramide, and a distinct variety of disease phenotypes, culminating in two recognized diseases: Farber disease and Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy (SMA PME). Farber disease represents a broad clinical spectrum presenting from infan cy through late childhood, associated with the pro inflammatory and pro apoptotic characteristics of ceramide. SMA PME, a late childhood onset, primarily neurologic disease, has been less well characterized to date, and the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestations are the subject of ongoing study. The prevalence of both diseases is currently  unknown and awareness of them is limited due to their rarity; both are li  kely underdiagnosed.We have collected data on over 20 living Farber patients, the largest cohort  to date, including data on biochemical and immunologic phenotypes. Our  findings reinforce the validity of the characteristic symptoms of Farber di sease: early onset polyarticular arthritis, subcutaneous nodules and dys phonia. However, it also reveals that there are patients who present with  only one or two of these symptoms, and that the spectrum of disease inclu   des remarkably attenuated forms with relatively little associated disability.  We feel there is an indication for diligent screening of certain pediatric (and  even young adult) polyarticular arthritis patients for Farber disease, and  certain therapy resistant epilepsy patients for SMA PME. Such screening is being initiated and natural history studies are planned in both diseases.

2158,687, De novo 19p13.2 microdeletion encompassing the part of NFIX gene in a girl with Sotos like phenotype,PM08.02,,"19p13.2 microdeletion is a rare genomic disorder. To date, less than ten cases was described so far in the literature. This chromosomal syndrome manifests in developmental delay/intellectual impairment, postnatal over   growth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphy, slender habitus, advanced bone age, and scoliosis. Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent. Very similar phenotype is observed in the Sotos syndrome 2 (MIM #614753) that is caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions of the NFIX gene located on chromosome 19p13.2.Here, we report on the case of a 7 year old girl referred to genetic counse   ling because of psychomotor retardation, speech delay and dysmorphic fea tures (macrocephaly, long/narrow and triangular face, high forehead, fron tal bossing, downslanting palpebral fissures, dysplastic low set ears, small nose, flat philtrum, micrognathia). At the examination, behavioral problems (anxiety, tantrums, autoaggression), seizures, and poor coordination were noted. Skeletal anomalies (advanced bone age, joint laxity, slender hands with long fingers, abnormal setting of the lower limbs), strabismus, hypero pia as well as constipations and abdominal pain were also diagnosed.Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a de novo 158.18 kb (the smallest so far) deletion of 19p13.2 region (chr19:13,020,206 13,178,390; hg19) encompassing seven genes; three of them (NFIX, DAND5 and CALR) could be the candidate genes for the genotype phenotype rela   tionship.This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13.2 microdeletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region.

2160,691, A milder Angelman syndrome phenotype due to a novel molecular mechanism: a maternally inherited 30kb deletion of 15q11.2 including the main gene promoter and non coding exon1 of UBE3A,PM08.06,,"We present a novel molecular cause of Angelman syndrome (AS) in a female patient with microcephaly, dysmorphism, global developmental and speech  delay and intellectual disability. Her phenotype resembles a milder form of  AS with no seizures and 20 words of speech at the age of 5 years. EEG inve stigation of the patient showed typical AS findings. Suspecting a clinical diagnosis of AS, molecular analysis was undertaken  using methylation specific PCR (MS PCR) and revealed normal methylation at the SNRPN DMR ruling out UPD, deletion or an imprinting defect asso   ciated with the majority of AS. Sequencing of the coding exons of UBE3A  revealed no pathogenic mutations. Microarray CGH identified a maternally  inherited 30kb deletion at 15q11.2 involving exon 1 of UBE3A. This deletion was de novo in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother and linkage analysis revealed the origin  of the deletion in the grand paternal allele, explaining the normal pheno  type in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother due to genomic imprinting.Although intragenic deletions of the maternal copy of UBE3A are a recog  nised cause of AS, to date there have been no reported deletions of exon 1.  Exon 1 is non protein coding and therefore not routinely sequenced. The intragenic deletion in our patient also includes the main promoter of UBE3A adjacent to exon 1 and the milder phenotype in our patient may be explai   ned by secondary promoters downstream producing transcripts.We present the detailed clinical phenotype of our patient, discuss the initial difficulties of interpreting the clinical significance of this novel finding and present the subsequent RNA/expression analysis.",2015.0,,"D.

2167,708, A novel HCN1 mutation not associated with epileptic encephalopathy,PS08.23,,"B. Rossi Hospital, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita  bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy   perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety  of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity.  Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as  sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi  leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with  different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits. Here we report the case of a 9 year old girl with a Rett like phenotype, cha  racterized by intellectual disability, hand stereotypies, absent speech, nega tive brain MRI and EEG data and no history of epilepsy. By NGS approach,  with the use of a targeted intellectual disability/epilepsy gene panel, we  found the girl to carry a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the HCN1 gene. This mutation is located in the glycine tyrosine glycine (GYG) motif, which constitutes the ion selectivity filter typical of K+  permeable channels.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects.We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con   tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase.This innovative strategy to collect information on natural history and co morbidities of rare monogenic forms of ID/autism will promote familiesÃ¢ÂÂ empowerment and hopefully impact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ care.

2192,774, Expression profile of circulating miRNAs in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),PS09.017,,"Introduction: ASD is a genetically complex disorder, highly heterogeneous and with unclear etiology. In this study we addressed the possible contri bution of epigenetic factors to ASD etiology, focusing on deregulated Mi croRNAs (miRNAs) expression. miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. miRNAs are thought to be released from pathological tissues to plasma in illness situations, and the strong correlation between circulating and tissue miRNAs indicates that plasma miRNAs may be useful disease biomarkers.Methods: miRNA plasma profiles were obtained for patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), essentially disruptive beha vior, language delay and psychomotor delay. Patients were all male, with a mean developmental coefficient of 92ÃÂ±18, and no obvious dysmorphisms. Exiqon human miRNome PCR panels (testing 752 miRNAs) were used for miRNA profiling.Results: We identified 50 miRNAs differentially expressed in ASD vs NDD. Notably, of the 10 miRNAs with higher fold change (increased 2.5 3.3X), 8 miRNAs had a target gene in common, MMP16. This gene is expressed at high levels in the brain, and a balanced de novo translocation in a ASD pati   ent involving MMP16 has previously been described.Conclusions: This is the first study of circulating miRNA profiles comparing patients with ASD and other NDDs. The preliminary results suggest that miRNA profilling may eventually improve differential diagnosis. The results also implicate novel pathological pathways in ASD, namely involving metal   oproteinases. These are crucial molecules for the integrity of the extracellu   lar matrix and consequently for cell migration and regeneration, processes thought to be involved in ASD.",2015.0,,"I. C.

Different studies have already pointed to  an impairment of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity as an underlying cause of SCZ pathology. To elucidate a putative contribution of genetic SHANK3 variants  to the etiology of SCZ, we sequenced the gene in 500 affected individuals and compared the sequencing results to ancestral   ly matched controls. Novel SHANK3 missense variants were identified in 1.6 % of the screened individuals, three of which were predicted as deleterious by at least two different algorithms. We identified association of 5 genetic variants, with study wide significance(P<0.001). Combined with previous studies, the rare G>V variant was  found in 4 out of 1543 SCZ patients and in 4 out of 2147 individuals with autismspectrum disorders (ASD), but not in 9315 controls.We conclude that the SHANK3  gene harbors different genetic variations predisposing to SCZ, ranging from common and uncommon va riants torare deleterious missense mutations.

A 10 year old boy with speech delay, dysmorphic features, short stature, joint hyperlaxity, muscular hypotony and conductive deafness is presented. His father was diagnosed with X linked spondilopehyseal dysplasia tarda.Birth parameters were normal. In the first months he developed motor de   velopmental delay with muscular hypotony. At one year short stature was diagnosed. Repeatedly he has been treated for mild middle ear infections and a conductive hearing loss was diagnosed at 10 years. At this age (height 130,67 cm ( 1.793 SDS); weight 28,25 kg ( 1.194 SDS); head circumference 55,5 cm (0.478 SDS)) he presented with two cafe au lait spots. Several dys morphic features were observed: long face, high vaulted palate, wide, retro verted nostrils, low set ears, tag on the lobule, deep philtrum, tented upper lip, joint hyperlaxity, proximal placed thumbs, wide spaced nipples and 2 3 toe syndactily of the both feet. The boy had difficulties in fine motor skills, concentration, attention and social skills. At the age of 11,5 years suspect of autism spectrum disorder was made.aCGH detected interstitial duplication of approximately 6.1Mb at 15q11.2q13.1 (arr[hg19] 15q11.2q13.1(22,765,628 28,940,098)ÃÂ3 mat), subsequently confirmed by FISH.

This mutation was found in myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) especially in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential throm bocythemia (ET). In addition, MPDs represent a risk factor for development of thrombosis that is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients.Materials and Methods: We aimed to consider the correlation between JAK2 mutation and thrombosis. Thirty nine patients who had clinical diagnosis as thrombocytosis and Budd Chiari syndrome from 2010 to 2014 were collec ted to determine JAK2 V617F mutation. DNA from all specimens were am plified and detected the presence of JAK2 V617F mutation by AS PCR.Results: In this study, we demonstrated JAK2 V617F mutation in both pa tients who had clinical diagnosis as thrombocytosis and Budd Chiari syn drome. We found that 11 of 37 (29.7%) thrombocytosis patients had JAK2 V617F mutation. Moreover, one of two patients who had represent as Budd Chiari syndrome was detected JAK2 V617F mutation.Conclusions: JAK2 V617F mutation has associated with thrombosis.

Pirogov, Separated  Structural Unit Ã¢ÂÂClinical Research Institute of PediatricsÃ¢ÂÂ, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation,  3Department of Medical Genetics, Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Ministry of Health, Moscow, Russian Federation,  4Moscow City University of Psychology and Education, Moscow, Russian Federation. The origins of somatic genome variations manifesting as structural chro mosomal rearrangements remain largely unknown. However, it is generally  accepted that susceptibility to structural chromosome aberrations can be  produced by alterations to DNA sequences flanking the breakpoints or to rearranged chromosomal regions (i.e. CNV). Addressing genome variations  in children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital  malformations (n,200) by high resolution CNV analysis (molecular karyo typing; resolution: 1 kbp or higher), we have surprisingly found that somatic structural chromosome abnormalities can co occur with non mosaic ones  within the same loci. More precisely, we detected 8 cases (4%) (4 dupli  cations and 4 deletions) demonstrating small non mosaic structural chro mosome rearrangements encompassed by larger mosaic ones. The dupli  cations were mosaic dup3p26.3p26.1 (5.8 Mb) vs. regular dup3p26.1 (2.9  Mb); mosaic dup14q32.13q32.2 (4.5 Mb) vs. regular dup14q32.2 (1.8 Mb); mosaic dup17p13.1p11.2 (6.9 Mb) vs. regular dup17p12 (1.4 Mb); mosaic  dup18p11.32p11.31 (5.3 Mb) vs. regular dup18p11.32p11.31 (4.8 Mb). The  deletions were mosaic del5q35.1q35.3 (9.2 Mb) vs. regular del5q35.2q35.3 (2.3 Mb); mosaic del14q11.2 (2.2 Mb) vs. regular del14q11.2 (0.5 Mb); mo saic del15q13.1q14 (8.2 Mb) vs. regular del15q13.2q13.3 (2 Mb); mosaic  delXp22.32p22.2 (4.7 Mb) vs. regular delXp22.31 (0.7 Mb). These findings  allowed us to hypothesize small regular structural variations (CNV) to be able to produce locus specific constitutional chromosome instability resul  ting in larger somatic rearrangements.

2398,1473, Genomic/epigenomic defects associated with surprisingly detected parental consanguinity uncovered by molecular karyotyping with SNP arrays,PS17.09,,"Parental consanguinity is generally accepted to be a risk factor for hereditary diseases. However, parents may not know about their consanguinity. As a re sult, clinical genetic evaluation is unable to provide a preliminary diagnosis for performing targeted molecular genetic diagnosis. Fortunately, there do exist whole genome scanning techniques making possible to detect not only genomic but also epigenomic variations (i.e. segmental loss of heterozygo sity or SLOH) for evaluating levels of consanguinity. Here, we have analyzed genomes of 188 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformations using SNP/oligonucleotide molecular karyoty   ping (Affymetrix) and an original bioinformatic technology for addressing phenotypic, cellular and molecular consequences of genomic/epigenomic variations. SLOH, specific to clinical manifestations in these children, were found in 6 cases (3.2%). It is to note that parental consanguinity was not initially reported in all these cases. In one child, Meier Gorlin syndrome was diagnosed. Other cases were also associated with hereditary diseases. Two cases of SLOH indirectly related to the phenotype were associated with mi crodeletions in 14q22.1 and 15q15.2, respectively. Parental consanguinity has long been considered as a source of knowledge about origins of here ditary diseases. In the present study, the possibility of genetic analyses of children born in consanguineous marriages has been extended by whole genome and bioinformatic analyses. Actually, it has been shown that sur prisingly detected consanguinity can be relatively common and molecular diagnosis using SNP arrays and bioinformatics can be useful for revealing of mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic diseases.

We will discuss the incorporation of public  RNAseq and SLRseq datasets into our annotation pipeline to identify novel loci and describe our PacBio Capture seq pipeline to extend loci to their full length and identify alternative splicing (AS). Additionally, we will show how  we use PhyloCSF and Mass Spectrometry data to check coding potential in  lncRNA loci and confirm their non coding status, or update their annotation.Combining multiple public and bespoke next generation data sets allows us  to identify novel lncRNA loci, extend and add AS transcripts to existing loci  and validate their non coding annotation in an effort to provide a more de   tailed picture of the human non coding transcriptome. *PubMedID 25504755 **http://www.gencodegenes.org/rgasp/ C24 Rare Disease Gene Discoverie",2016.0,,"M.

2623,422, Farber disease: a growing clinical cohort indicates that acid ceramidase deficiency has a broader clinical spectrum and higher incidence than previously anticipated,P04.047,," Farber disease (Farber lipogranulomatosis) represents a broad clinical spectrum presenting from infancy through late childhood, with joint disease (arthritis and/or contractures), subcutaneous nodules and hoarseness as sociated with the pro inflammatory and pro apoptotic characteristics of the lipid ceramide. Farber is caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene, which lead to acid ceramidase deficiency, accumulation of ceramide, and a distinct va riety of disease phenotypes, culminating in two recognized diseases: Farber disease and Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy (SMA PME). The prevalence of both diseases is currently unknown and awa  reness of them is limited due to their rarity; both are likely underdiagnosed. We have begun collecting data including genotypes, clinical, biochemical and immunologic phenotypes, on a growing cohort of over 30 living Farber  patients from around the world. Our findings so far reinforce the validity  of the characteristic symptoms of Farber disease (arthritis, nodules, dys phonia). However, it also reveals that there are patients who present with only one or two of these symptoms, and that the spectrum of disease inclu   des remarkably attenuated forms with relatively little associated disability. These insights provide an indication for screening of certain pediatric and young adult polyarticular arthritis patients for acid ceramidase deficiency,  and such programs are being initiated. Acid ceramidase enzyme therapy is  currently under development, and Plexcera Therapeutics is working with physicians and patients to develop a natural history study framework to  better understand disease progression and factors influencing the different  phenotypes, as well as what benefits can be derived from currently available anti inflammatory treatments.",2016.0,,"A.

Introduction. 2q37.3 deletion syndrome is considered to be a rare chro mosomal disorder associated with variable clinical features, among which are intellectual disability (ID), autistic features, brachydactyly, short stat   ure, hypotonia and obesity. Some facial features are characteristic for the syndrome (i.e. round face, frontal bossing, arched eyebrows, deep set eyes, upslanted palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, thin upper lip, minor ear anomalies). Haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 seems to be the most critical for the phenotypic spectrum.

Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping by SNP/oligonucleotide mi  croarray (resolution: >1kbp) was used to analyze 300 children with ID, au   tism spectrum disorders and congenital malformations. Results. Cytogenetically visible 2q37 deletions were detected in 2 cases.  Molecular karyotyping confirmed the presence of these deletions (5Mb and 8.5Mb). Furthermore, a CNV within 2q37.3 (44kbp) leading to HDAC4 loss was detected in a patient. All affected female patients had ID, autism and  minor ear anomalies. One had widely set nipples and hypotonia. Another  one had a short statue. Two patients presented with ocular hypertelorism. HDAC4 haploinsufficiency was observed in all three cases. Conclusions. We show that 2q37 deletions can be common in children with  ID, autism, congenital malformations tending to a frequency as high as 1%. Therefore, one can suggest that 2q37.3 deletions are likely to be more com  mon among these children than previously recognized.

2657,651, Targeted gene panel to investigate intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders comorbidity,P08.14,,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinical   ly and genetically heterogeneous diseases. Recent whole exome sequencing studies indicated that genes associated with different neurologic disorders are shared among these disorders or converge on common functional pa thways.The aim of this study was to design a customized multiplex PCR based gene panel to investigate the genetic bases of ID and ASD comorbidity. The gene panel covers 74 genes, including a subset of genes that are found recurrently mutated in ID or ASD conditions, genes shared among ID and ASD disease network and ID/ASD genes that are directly connected to these. We analy   zed 18 clinically selected patients with ID and ASD without syndromic fea tures, negative for Fragile X test and array CGH.

2663,686,"Efficacy of GenIDA, a family oriented international online registry and clinical database for genetic forms of intellectual disability and/or autism, to collect medically relevant information on the Koolen de Vries Syndrome",P08.52,,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are over   lapping disorders that constitute a major public health problem with a cu  mulated frequency of about 2.5%. Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen   tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members.Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen   de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy   potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website.This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare diseases affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

Results : WES analysis revealed homozygous pre viously unreported variant in exon 25 of the PGAP1 gene, c.2349delins14 (p.His783Glnfs*2) in patients. Both parents are heterozygous carrier of the detected variant. Conclusions: We present a novel PGAP1variant in a Tur kish family. Few cases were reported about PGAP1 mutations in patients with intellectual disability. Our case presentation will be helpful to define the phenotype of the patients with PGAP1 mutations and to confirm the cli nical findings of previous studies and also to shed light on the further stu dies.

2669,704, Characterization of patient with de novo frameshift PUF60 mutation suggests that disruption of this gene is sufficient for most symptoms of Verheij syndrome,P08.72,,"Verheij syndrome (OMIM 615583) is associated with rare de novo 8q24.3  microdeletions. Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce   phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial   ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60  and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense  PUF60  mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked  coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60  and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced  different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome.We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty   ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four  nucleotides in PUF60  (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p.I136Tfs*31). The  patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome. The  case illustrates the strength of exome sequencing in deciphering the genetic basis of diseases.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.",2016.0,,"M.

2671,706, Copy number variation in RBFOX1 and DOCK8: Neurodevelopmental disorders or benign variants?,P08.74,,"Deletions and duplications involving the genes RBFOX1 and DOCK8 have been implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disor   ders (ASD). However, the clinical significance of these CNVs is controversial. We analysed 14 RBFOX1 deletions (20 309 kb), six RBFOX1 duplications (34 kb to 1.34 Mb), and eight DOCK8 deletions (22 227 kb) from unrelated individuals. Our analysis revealed that five DOCK8 deletions were terminal and three were interstitial. Two deletions lie within intron 1, two include only exon 1, and four include multiple exons. Thirteen of the RBFOX1 de   letions lie within a single intron; deletion of intron 3 and intron 4 are the most common. Though the clinical information provided is limited, seven individuals with RBFOX1 deletions have a diagnosis of ASD. The clinical si gnificance of duplications is difficult to interpret since intragenic gains can lead to loss of function, whereas whole gene duplication can lead to triplo sensitivity. Half of the RBFOX1 duplications have one breakpoint upstream of the gene and one breakpoint in intron 2, which is predicted to maintain the reading frame if the duplications are in direct tandem orientation. One RBFOX1 duplication lies entirely within intron 3 and two include only exon 4, which could lead to an out of frame transcript. Our analysis sheds light on the genomic structures of small CNVs implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Only two CNVs had identical breakpoints, suggesting diversity in RBFOX1 and DOCK8 rearrangements rather than a few common variants. However, the clinical significance of these CNV remains unclear since all CNVs we included were inherited.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  173Back to index",2016.0,,"S.

2680,743, The power of New Generation Sequencing in identifying mutations in non specific ASD ID phenotypes: the example of SHANK3,P09.019,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by im  pairments in reciprocal social communication and stereotyped behaviors.  Intellectual Disability (ID) frequently coexists with these two core sym  ptoms. Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3  concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo  derate to profound ID. SHANK3  haploinsufficiency is frequently associated  with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs  to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing  of this gene.Materials and Methods: Here we report on 2 boys with ASD and ID and a girl  with severe ID associated with a SHANK3  mutation found by next generation  sequencing (NGS) study (Illumina). Results: Two of these mutations are truncated and de novo involving the  exon 21 in the prolin rich domain (NM_001080420.1:c.2955_2970dup  (p.(Pro992Arg*325) and NM_001080420.1:c.4381C>T (p.(Gln1461*)).

The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication can be associated with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. The aim was to assess the neural networks involved in visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval in ASD due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication.Materials and methods: A woman with autistic features, macrocephaly and body asymmetry due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication and 7 healthy controls were investigated. Six runs of BOLD fMRI data were collected to assess the networks of the visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval; a single run of encoding task was followed by 10 minute retention period, then 2 runs of the retrieval tasks both for visual and verbal domain respectively. During encoding participants were instructed to memorize the task stimu li, whilst during retrieval they were instructed to decide whether the given image or word was presented during the encoding period. Data analysis was performed using the SPM8 toolbox under Matlab, with standard processing steps.Results: In patient fMRI for visual memory encoding/retrieval showed hig her activation in the posterior insulae, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared to the controls where visual areas were predominant in these tasks. Verbal memory activation was higher in the hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, precuneus; and lower in the anterior insulae; higher visual areas in our patient compared to the controls.Conclusion: The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication resulted in peculiar activity pat   tern of the brain responsible for visual and verbal memory in ASD.

We selected CNVs spanning well established candidate genes for ASD, and compared transmitting and non transmitting parental test scores using a t test corrected for multiple testing by the Group Benja   mini Hochberg Procedure. Overall, CNV transmitting parents did not differ significantly in BAPQ and  SRS scores from non transmitting parents.

2696,769, Structural chromosome 21 specific instability in the diseased brain,P09.046,," Introduction. Chromosome 21 aneuploidy has been shown to affect the di  seased brain especially in individuals with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD). Howe  ver, structural chromosome 21 specific instability has never been a target  for molecular (neuro)cytogenetic studies of the diseased brain. Here, we have addressed chromosome 21 structural variations in single cells of the  AD, schizophrenia and autism brain as well as in the unaffected brain. Materials and Methods. Ten AD, 18 schizophrenia, 12 autism and 20 age  and sex matched samples of the postmortem brain (frontal cortex, Brod   mann area 10) were studied by interphase chromosome specific multicolor  banding (ICS MCB) and NeuN  immunohistochemistry. Results. We were able to show that rare recurrent rearrangements of chro mosome 21 or structural chromosome 21 specific instabilities are found al   most exclusively in the AD brain. These were isochromosomes 21q, 21q22 >qter losses and chromosome 21 breaks at 21q21 and 21q22 affecting 0.6 3.7% of cells. NeuN immunohistochemistry has indicated that the instability  randomly affects NeuN positive and NeuN negative cell nuclei in contrast to  chromosome 21 breaks, which were more prevalent in NeuN positive cell  nuclei.Conclusions. Our data suggests that chromosome 21 specific instability is able to contribute to the AD pathogenesis. One can hypothesize chromoso   me 21 breaks confined to NeuN positive cells of the AD brain to result from the dysregulation of DNA replication/reparation or DNA damage response pathways.

2709,813, Genetic studies of multiple consanguineous families with primary microcephaly revealed pathogenic variants in ASPM and CDK6,P09.095,,"Background: Primary microcephaly is a rare genetic disorder that is charac terized by reduced head circumference and intellectual disability. Genetic studies have identified 15 (MCPH) causative genes which include MCPH1, WDR62, CDK5RAP2, CASC5, ASPM, CENPJ, STIL, CEP135, CEP152, ZNF335, PHC1, CDK6, CENPE, SASS6 and MFSD2A. Physiologically, most of the prote in products of these MCPH genes are involved in cell cycle and its regulation.Methods: The genomic analysis was performed through whole exome se   quencing, while co segregation of the identified pathogenic variants in the corresponding family members was carried out by sanger DNA sequencing.Results: In the present genetic study, we present three consanguineous Pakistani families segregating primary microcephaly that are ascertained from the rural area of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Sequence analysis of two families revealed one novel [NM_018136.4: c.10013delA (p.Asp3338Valfs*2)] and a previously reported [NM_018136.4: c.9730C>T (p.Arg3244*)] mutation in ASPM gene. The novel frame shift mutation (p.Asp3338Valfs*2) in ASPM presumably truncate the protein synthesis that result in loss of armadillo type fold domain. The third family showed the same missense mutation [NM_001259.6: c.589G A (p. Ala197Thr)] in CDK6 gene as recently identified in a single Pakistani family.Conclusion: ASPM is the most prevalent gene for MCPH in south Asian po pulations, and our study also expanded its mutational spectrum. The repor   ted CDK6 gene has previously been mapped in a consanguineous Pakistani family, and here we are reporting the second family. These results further extend the evidence of CDK6 gene implication in MCPH and suggest its foun der effect in the Pakistani population.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  199Back to index",2016.0,,"M.

It usually affects boys, but also there are girls affected. Duplication could be de novo or inherited from asymptomatic carrier mother. It has been reported about 120 cases all over the world, wi thout a known incidence.The aim of the study is to characterize a Spanish cohort with MECP2 dupli cation syndrome to improve our knowledge of the disease and perform a genotype phenotype correlation.Material and Method: The cohort consists in 13 patients of both sexes dia gnosed in different Spanish hospitals. The duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array. The clinical characterization was carried out using a checklist designed for the project. The molecular characterization is di vided into several steps: 1) Checking the duplication by qPCR doses, stu dy XCI and FISH; 2) If FISH shows tandem duplication, we narrowed the breakpoints through qPCR, PCR long and Sanger sequencing; 3) Analyze the expression of the two MeCP2 isoforms by RT qPCR.Results: In this collaborative study has been characterized a heterogeneous cohort, with both sexes, with different phenotypes (Rett like and duplicati   on patients) and inherited or de novo duplication located in different regi ons (tandem, other region of ChrX or ChrY). However, this information is not enough to create a clear genotype phenotype correlation.Conclusions: We suppose MECP2 duplication syndrome is an underdia gnosed disease that needs further characterization studies in order to give a better genetic and clinical diagnosis.",2016.0,,"L.

2722,925, First familial case of Angelman syndrome in Bulgaria,P11.012,,"Introduction: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by genetic defects leading to loss of expression of the maternal copy of the chromosome 15q11 13 imprinted region. Most cases are sporadic, being caused by de novo deletion of maternal chromosome 15q11 13 or by paternal uniparental disomy. Familial cases can occur, due to mutations in the UBE3A gene or in the imprinting center.Materials and Methods: We describe two sibs with mental retardation, ab   sence of speech, and typical facial dysmorphism. The family members were screened by MS MLPA probemix ME028 B2 Prader Willi/Angelman for copy number variations and assessment of methylation profile. Both child  ren MS MLPA profiles were compared with their parents and 3 normal con  trols.Results: The test for methylation revealed missing SNRPN methylation spe  cific fragments in the patients profile in comparison to their parents and  normal controls, which is compatible with paternal non methylated frag ments and deleted or wrong methylated maternal fragments. The copy number test did not show deletion of the SNRPN specific fragments, but two  other fragments, corresponding to AS SRO region (part of the PWS AS im  printing center) were deleted. The deletion was detected in both affected children and it was inherited from the asymptomatic mother. Conclusion: The missing SNRPN methylation specific fragments correspond  to wrong methylation (demethylation) on the maternal allele due to deleti on of the PWS AS imprinting center. This mistake in the methylation profile  in both affected children affects maternal copy, while in the asymptomatic  mother most probably the deletion affects the paternal copy, hence non pathogenic.",2016.0,,"B.

Although  germline mutations are known to increase the risk of many diverse, rare tumours such as pleuropulmonary blastoma and sertoli leydig cell tumours and multinodular goitre, the complete phenotype is still poorly understood. The variability in expression and the lack of penetrance data continues to make DICER1 a difficult condition to diagnose and counsel around.

2750,1159,genetic investigation of familial hematological malignancies,P12.100,,"Introduction: Familial aggregation among patients with several hematolo gical malignancies has been revealed. This emphasizes the importance of  genetic factors. Only few genes predisposing to familial hematological ma  lignancies have been reported until now due to the low occurrence. Few variants that might contributing to the background of genetic factors were  reported, this fact encourage us to extend our investigations to other co  operating genes. We target several genes previously reported in sporadic hematological malignancies as apoptotic genes (FAS, FASLG, CASP8, CASP10, PRF1 ), proto oncogenes (CRAF, BRAF, CBL), tumor suppressor genes (CEB  PA, TP53, RUNX1) and genes involved in several cell process (YY1, ASXL1, NPM1, JAK2). Materials and Methods: In this study, we investigated these 15 candidate genes by direct sequencing in 20 Tunisian familial cases with  aggregated hematological malignancies. Results: We report a new ASXL1  germline missense substitution p.Arg402Gln in two related patients that we  describe it for the first time in non Hodgkin lymphoma. We report also a  PRF1  p.Ala211Val variant in two related patients both diagnosed with Hod   ginien lymphoma. In silico analysis has predicted potential deleterious effect  of these two variants and were totally absent in 200 control chromosomes.  We report also two intronic substitutions: c.1641+6 T>C in JAK2 gene and  559+1 G>A in TP53 gene in familial cases diagnosed respectively with Hod   ginien lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This two substitutions may disrupt the splice site and impact the normal protein function. Con   clusion: From an extended candidate genes analyzed in the Ã¯Â¬Âeld of familial hematological malignancies, ASXL1, TP53, JAK2  and PRF1  might be involved.

Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a myeloproliferative neo plasm of childhood with a poor prognosis. The only curative therapy is he  matopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with relapse being the most  common reason for treatment failure. The patient is a 5 year old boy with a 3,5 year history of JMML. The disease had progressed to acute leukemia  after low dose chemotherapy, so the patient received allogeneic HSCT , and  he relapsed after the transplantation. We performed the genetic work up at 3 points: at initial evaluation, at progression and at post transplant relapse. DNA extracted from bone marrow was sequenced using Illumina TruSight  Myeloid sequencing panel on the MiSeq platform, with following valida   tion using Sanger sequencing. Analysis of the first point revealed a novel  NRAS mutation NM_002524: c.29_31dupGAG (NP_002515: p.Gly10dup)  with 48% mutated allele frequencies. The point at progression revealed  SETB1 c.2612T>C (p.Ile871Thr), ZRSR2 c.557+2T>G, ASXL1 c.2131insA (p.Thr711fs) and the same NRAS mutations in 24%, 96%, 45% and 49% of  reads respectively. Relapse point revealed the same ZRSR2, ASXL1 and NRAS  mutations in 83%, 39% and 48% of reads respectively. NRAS mutation was  not found in buccal smear cells DNA samples indicating its somatic origin.  NRAS is known to be one of the key genes in JMML pathogenesis, and this novel mutation is in the hot spots region for JMML, while SETBP1, ASXL1  and ZRSR2 are among targets for secondary mutations.

Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of pathogenic links between MS and abnormalities in alternative splicing (AS). Among splicing regulators, besides hnRNPs and SR proteins, long noncoding RNAs (lncR   NAs) are emerging as critical players in pre mRNA AS. Here, we aimed at exploring the role of MALAT1, an abundant lncRNA reported to influence AS through its interaction with pre mRNA splicing factors.Materials and Methods: The expression levels of several splicing regulators, as well as the AS pattern of specific MS related genes, were evaluated in HEK293, HeLa, and SH SY5Y cells after MALAT1 overexpression or downre gulation. Gene expression analysis was performed by real time RT PCR and RNAseq analysis.Results: Upon MALAT1 modulation, expression levels of splicing regulato ry genes, such as HNRNPF and CELF1, were significantly dysregulated in a cell specific manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MALAT1 overex   pression/silencing influence also the AS pattern of IL7R and PRKCA genes, previously associated with MS susceptibility and characterized by the pres   ence of a SNP acting on splicing.

We analyzed the genomes of three patients with  congenital disease without apparent karyotype anomalies. The rearran  gements displayed unanticipated complexity resembling chromothripsis.  The array CGH analysis identified complex chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 (Case 1), 12 (Case 2) and 1 and 4 (Case 3). Case 1 presented a complex clinical phenotype in which coexisted 3 known dis   orders: Potocki Lupski syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease and neu rofibromatosis type 1.

Case 3 exhibited a complex clinical picture, not im mediately framed with 1p36 deletion syndrome (array CGH revealed a 3  Mb deletion in 1p36). With whole genome sequencing we investigated the  genetic architecture of these constitutional complex chromosomal rearran  gements (CCRs),copy number profiling, and breakpoint junctions proving  that the rearrangements (deletions/duplications/inversions) identified in our cases were not clustered on a single chromosome region, but on the  whole length of the chromosomes.

Low ceramidase  activity is resulting in accumulation of fatty substances, mainly ceramides. At clinical level, Farber disease is manifesting through hallmark symptoms  such as: periarticular nodules, lipogranulomas, swollen and painful joints  and a hoarse voice or a weak cry; in addition to these, also hepatospleno  megaly, rapid neurological deterioration or developmental delay are repor   ted [1, 5 6]. Seven different Farber types were described, with phenotypes varying from mild cases with a longer life expectancy to very severe cases,  where the patients do not survive past their first year of life. The screening through over 40 different ceramide like molecule show that  only C26 is specifically increased in samples from Farber patients. We pre sent here a new method of diagnosis of Farber disease by determining the concentration of C26 ceramide isoforms using LC/MRM MS and C25 cera  mide as internal standard. Moreover, we found that cis isomer of the C26  ceramide is a specific biomarker for Farber disease, with pathological va  lues in a range of 39.2 150.0 nmol/L blood (normal range 13.6 23.4 nmol/L blood, N,192, healthy individuals).

2796,1487, Genotyping of all public RNA sequencing data for large scale trans QTL and ASE studies,P16.66,,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses have recently identified hundreds of disease  and expresssion associated genetic loci. However, finding the causal SNP in a  locus remains challenging, especially for rare variants. Additionally, studies  show that eQTL effects are often cell type and tissue specific, so there is a  need for large numbers of cell type specific samples. We have previously shown that public RNAseq data from 9500 samples can be used to identify eQTL effects for 8,034 unique genes (Deelen et al., 2015). By analyzing pu  blic RNAseq samples at an even larger scale, we will further increase our  detection power. For this purpose we developed a pipeline to genotype and quantify gene ex   pression for all RNAseq samples in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). In August we retrieved 33,000 samples from ENA, which includes, among  others, eight tissues with each over 500 samples. Of the 33,000 quantified  samples, 9,000 have been haplotype called and approximately 5,000 are of sufficient quality to continue with genotyping.This strictly quality controlled re use of freely available data will allow us to find many previously undetected allelic imbalanced SNPs and eQTLs. Mo reover, we expect the sample size to be large enough to also find tissue speci   fic trans eQTLs and to contribute meaningfully in large scale trans eQTL or ASE studies.

Logistic regression analyses were carried out in each dataset and subsequently meta analyzed. We further tested for involvement of known canonical pathways for loci that had significant asso   ciations in our study using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.Results: We detected associations at five index variants at the CDKN2A/2B , PHACTR1, BCAS3, ABO and VAMP5/VAMP8/GGCX loci (P values 6.37x10 4   4.53x10 2).

Detection of low grade mosaicism involves many factors, like the type and number of tissues analyzed, the number of cells studied and the sensitivity of the techniques applied.We describe a case of cytogenetic analysis after amniocentesis in which a normal male karyotype was obtained. Postnatal molecular cytogenetic tests on peripheral blood revealed a low level trisomy 9 mosaicism.Amniocentesis requested for advanced maternal age gave a normal male ka ryotype. Because of poor fetal growth and the pathological CTG emergency cesarean section at 32nd week of gestation was done. At the age of 10 month the propositus was presenting some abnormalities: hypotonia, delayed mo tor development, mild micrognathia, deeper palmar and plantar creases, left eye strabismus, bilateral cryptorchidism and bilateral inguinal hernia. Ultra sound examination revealed ASD secundum, dilatation of the left ventricle, and bilateral mild pyelectasis.These findings led us to perform postnatal molecular cytogenetic testing.

2840,1851,7p13,P08.051,,"Introduction: 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome has a wide spectrum of clinical features, including intellectual disability, absent/very poor speech,  dysmorphism and microcephaly. This clinical diversity is partly a conse   quence of deletion size, which ranges from 245kb to 4.4Mb. Thus, it is sugge  sted that two or more microdeletion syndromes may exist within this region  and a genotype phenotype correlation has yet to emerge. Here we discuss  the genetic and clinical features observed in a patient with a small 17p13.1 deletion. We focus on microcephaly, a prominent feature of this syndrome. Material and Methods: We report a 4 year old boy referred to aCGH testing  presenting with global psychomotor delay, facial dysmorphisms and micro  cephaly. Family history was unremarkable. Samples were studied by aCGH (NimbleGen CGX 135K, Perkin Elmer). Genomic analysis was performed  with Genoglyphix v3.0 software (Signature Genomics). Results: aCGH re  vealed a de novo microdeletion of 287.53kb in the 17p13.1 region (hg19; chr17:7,119,830 7,407,357) containing 23 OMIM genes. Overlapping our  deletion with the previously reported 17p13.1 microdeletions, we identified  a new minimal region of 92kb for microcephaly. Conclusions: The pheno type observed in our patient is consistent with the 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome. Previously reported patients with 17p13.1 deletions pointed to an overlapping region associated with microcephaly, including four genes, ASGR1, ACADVL, DVL2 and GABARAP . Considering the presence of microce   phaly in our patient and the lack of ASGR1 gene in the deleted segment, we propose to exclude this gene as a candidate for this feature. These findings contribute to narrow the 17p13.1 critical genomic region associated with microcephaly. E",2016.0,,"E. A. Rolo, A. Sousa, S. Serafim, R. Rodrigues, S. CustÃÂ³dio, R.

In a recent stu dy, a K Cl cotransporter protein, KCC2 gene SLC12A5 on chromosome 20,  which previously was linked to idiopathic generalized epilepsy, familial fe  brile seizures and schizophrenia, was reported to be associated with func tionally impairing variants in autism spectrum disorders. Here, we report a  novel association of a polymorhism, rs9074, located in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR region of  SLC12A5 with autistic like traits in a healthy population.A total of 75 healthy volunteers aged between 18 30 participated to the study. Autistic like traits were quantitized on the autism spectrum quotient  (AQ) scale. AQ scores measured for each individual were comprised of five  subscales of social skills, attention switching, communication, attention to details and imagination categories utilizing a previously validated version  of the AQ in Turkish. SNP genotyping assays were performed with specific  primers and probes in an RT PCR platform.rs9074 genotypes were distributed as GG:48%, GA:41.3%, AA:10.7% with  allele frequencies in HWE. Total AQ (p,0.008), social skills (p,0.002) and at   tention switching (p,0.038) subscale scores were significantly higher in AA  bearers compared to GG+GA genotypes (Mann Whitney U test).

2858,1902, Genetics of language deficits in schizophrenia and autism: an evolutionary approach,P09.38,,"Both autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are highly prevalent cognitive disorders, entailing language deficits. Recent advances in genome wide technologies have provided with a long list of candidate genes for SZ and ASD, but the gap between genes, the pathophysiology of SZ and ASD, and their distinctive cognitive and linguistic profiles still remains open. Our study aims to bridge this gap through an evo devo approach that focuses on how language evolved in the species and that construes both con ditions as poles of a continuum of modes of cognition, also encompassing typically developing cognition. To this aim, we have performed literature mining and network analysis of known candidate genes for SZ and ASD and found that they are overrepresented among the gene believed to be impor   tant for the evolution of the human faculty of language. Many of these genes are common risk factors for both conditions. Additionally, we performed in silico data mining of previously published SZ and ASD microarray data   sets and found that many of these genes important for language evolution (like CNTNAP2, DLX5, FOXP1, or ROBO2) are differentially expressed in the brains of schizophrenics and autists.

Detection of KRAS mutations is critical for  effective and appropriate treatment for individual patients. The aim of the present study was to develop Allele Specific PCR (AS PCR) assay for analysis of the mutational status of KRAS codons 12 and 13, at nucleotides 34, 35  and 38.Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from 41 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer tissues. The AS primers for specific amplifying wild type KRAS were established. The assay has been validated  with pyrosequencing method. The sensitivity and limit of detection were determined.Results: Three AS primers were successfully distinguished wild type KRAS from the mutant alleles at nucleotides 34, 35 and 38. The limit of detection was detected at 50 55% mutant allele with the lowest amount of DNA at 10  ng/ul. The results of AS PCR assay were in good concordance with pyrose   quencing only in samples with % mutant alleles greater than 60%.

Several studies de   scribed an association between the functional repeat length polymorphism 5 HTTLPR, with two common repeat elements (14R; S allele and 16R; L al lele), and impulsivity, aggression, and conduct disorders. This study aims to replicate the association between 5 HTTLPR and antisocial behavior (ASB) in response to childhood environment (CE) in a general population sample of young adults.Materials and Methods: A sample of 205 (103 males; 102 females) Por   tuguese healthy individuals, aged 18 37 years, was enrolled in the study. Both ASB and CE were assessed by self reports using questionnaires. Ge notyping was performed for polymorphisms 5 HTTLPR and rs25531 accor   ding to published protocols.Results: Allele frequencies (5 HTTLPR L:0.56, S:0.44; rs25531 A:0.95, G:0.05) were similar to those previously reported for European populations and genotype distributions were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (P,0.866 and P,0.431, respectively). When considering individuals exposed to adver   se CE a grading tendency towards ASB was observed in carriers of S alleles. Linear regression analysis yielded near significant association (P,0.05) bet   ween the S allele and ASB in males. By contrast, in the group not exposed to adverse CE, individuals homozygous for the L allele were more prone to commit ASB. The L allele was found significantly associated (P,0.01) with ASB when testing all subjects.Conclusions: The findings showing that the S allele carriers are more vul   nerable to childhood negative environments for ASB outcomes and profit more from positive environmental conditions support the hypothesis that 5 HTTLPR is a genetic marker of differential susceptibility.

A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ï¬uence genetic risk. I.M.

BDNF is indispensable for brain development. CADPS2 is maternally expressed in human blood and amygdala.Maternally inherited genetic variants of CADPS2 were suggested to contribute to intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), whereas paternallyinherited missense variants were not shown to have speci ï¬c phenotype. We report on two unrelated girls, in whom array CGH was performed due to ID and behavioral pro blems. Patient 1, a 13 year old girl showed a microdeletion of 79 kb in 7q31.32(12212618_122291639) (GRCh37/ hg19) encompassing four exons of CADPS2 . Her beha  vioral phenotype was characterized by anxiety. She showed mild dysmorphic features in terms of arched eyebrows and a prominent columella, the body measurements were normal.Patient 2, a 4 year old girl, had a microdeletion of 4.15 Mb in 7q31.31q31.32(118243718_122394183) (GRCh37/hg19) encompassing the whole CADPS2 gene.

2899,237, A novel KDM6B gene de novo mutation in two siblings with a variable neurocognitive phenotype,P08.29,,"Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Praha 5   Motol, Czech Republic Introduction: The clinical  and genetic heterogeneity of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) poses a signi ï¬cant diagnostic challenge. Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ï¬rst line diag  nostic  and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22  and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con  ï¬rmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme  thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ï¬ed a thirdâmutation âinKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ï¬ndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

Nowakowska1 1Department of Medical Genetics, Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland,22) Department of Molecular & Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States,3Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are one of the most common groups of neurodevelopmental disorders with theprevalence of 1 â2%. Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of ASDs; it has been estimated that sub  microscopic copy number variants (CNVs) are the cause ofASDs in ~ 5 â13% of patients. We elected to use aCGH to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 178 patients with ASDs and toidentify novel ASDs genes. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using genome wide oligonucleo  tide microarrays (180k; Agilent Technology, OGT) with anaverage resolution of 30 kpz.

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities.Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro  mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol  vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ï¬rmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet. Five disease related genes arelocated in affected region and only haploinsuf ï¬ciency sen  sitive TBX6 has indirect effect on neural development. V. Å liuas: None. B. Aleksiuniene: None. E.

The deletion occurs near the end of the chromosome at a location designated q13.3.In addition to normal growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological de ï¬cits which include global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual impairment, absent or severely delayed speech, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Some people with this condition have autismor autistic like behavior that affects communication and social interaction, such as poor eye contact, sensitivity to touch, and aggressive behaviors. They may also chew onnon food items such as clothing. Less frequently, people with this condition have seizures. Patient 1: 9 year old girl patient Genetic Diseases Diagnosis referred to our center with autism like behaviors. The chromosome structure was determined as 46,XX.

It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep  set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC  related phenotype and its developmental tra  jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype  ï¬rst approach.

Here we report autistic behaviour patient with lack of speech and developmental delay that was referred for genetic testing. Both father andbrother of the proban are heterozygous carriers of beta  talasemia mutations. The patient was previously tested for Fragile X syndrome and X linked mental retardation relatedgenes were sequenced as well as whole exome sequencing was performed without detecting any relevant variants correlating with the clinical features. The only positiveresult was for HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genes predisposing to celiac disease. At the end aCGH array (180K) was per  formed and it detected 278kb duplicated region (11p14.3 /chr11: 22102205 22361578) that included the ANO5 and SLC17A6 genes. This duplication was interpreted as uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance based on the international recommendations. Second aCGH analysis with higher resolution (2,7M) was perform so we can gain additional information and eventually to clarify the previous ï¬nding. An additional duplication of 312 kb was detected in chro  mosome 15 (15q11.2), which included 4 genes: TUBGCP5 , CYFIP1 ,NIPA2 and NIPA1 (PMIDs: 28588435, 27566550). Duplication was inherited by the father who is without clinical manifestation. The 15q11.2 BP1 BP2 region is found duplicated or deleted in people with cog nitive, language, and behavioral impairmen and a variable phenotype so probably this ï¬nding is the leading cause for the clinical features in the affected child.

A total of 13/21 pathogenic CNVs were observedin 8 patients, all located at genetic ASD hotspots, including 22q11.23, Xp22.33 (2/13), 16p11.2 (3/13), harboring no OMIM genes. However, the hotspots at 15q13.3, 15q11.2(2/13), and Xp11.23 (2/13) harbored CHRNA7 ,PWRN2 and ZNF630 genes, respectively, associated with ASD. The remaining CNVs were classi ï¬ed as having unknown clinical signi ï¬cance, distributed at loci: 2q12.2, 3p22.1, 9p21.1 (3/8), Xp22.32, Xq21.1, and Xq24. Two patients showed no alterations in CMA. Conclusions: Identify CNVs and genes using CMA in our patients was very important to understand the hetero  geneous spectrum of ASD.

Despite a wide variety of available data, speci ï¬c biological processes underlying abnormal neurodevelopment remain to be unmasked. Here, we have used molecular cytogenetic data to analyze speci ï¬c pathways leading to neuropsychiatric diseases in children. Materials and Methods: Conventional and molecular karyotyping was used to evaluate 427 patients with idiopathic intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, andcongenital malformations. An original bioinformatic tech  nique based on candidate process prioritization (Iourov et al., 2014; Yurov et al., 2017) was applied to pathwayenrichment among these patients. Results: Molecular cytogenetic analysis has shown CNVs relevant to a pathway functional change in 397children (93%). The highest enrichment rates (gene percentage among all the prioritized candidate genes/ processes) were found for the following pathways: cellcycle (4.68%), MAPK signaling (6.56%), pathways in cancer (11.94%), DNA replication (1.64%). All the children exhibiting the genomic variations altering genes involved inthese pathways were found to present with chromosome instability (mosaic aneuploidy, chromosome breaks/fragi  lity, non speci ï¬c structural chromosomal rearrangements), whereas the remainder was not demonstrating de ï¬nable chromosome instability. Conclusions: Alterations to pathways associated with genome/chromosome stability maintenance through the cell cycle were shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. The consequences of the altera tions were found to be detectable at chromosomal level. These data supports a previously proposed hypothesis describing two /multiple hits to genome stability as apossible mechanism of neuropsychiatric diseases (Iourov et al., 2013).

Their high genetic heterogeneity hinders the devel  opment of effective gene based therapies. We have recentlydemonstrated that the microRNA miR 204 is essential for retinal function and plays a pathogenic role in IRD in humans. Therefore, we investigated the potential ther apeutic action of this microRNA in IRDs. Materials and Methods: We delivered by subretinal injection an adeno associated viral vector carrying the miR 204 precursor to the Aipl1 knockout and the P347S  RHO transgenic mouse lines, models of autosomal recessive and dominant forms of IRDs, respectively. The impact on retinalfunction and degeneration was assessed by electroretino  graphic and immunohistological analyses. Results: We detected a notable improvement of the ERG response in the miR 204 injected eyes of P347S  RHO mice. This effect persisted for two months post injection and was prevalent under photopic conditions that re ï¬ect cone activity. We also observed a preservation of cone photo  receptors and a signi ï¬cant decrease in apoptotic photo  receptor cells. Photoreceptors were better preserved also inthe miR204 injected eyes of Aipl1 knockout mice. Tran  scriptome analysis suggested that dampening of microglia activation represents one of the main mechanisms under lying the neuroprotective effect of miR 204. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings indicate that the subretinal delivery of miR 204 attenuates retinal degeneration in IRDmouse models and preserves retinal function, supporting the gene independent therapeutic potential of this microRNA.

Hydration of their reduced forms (either spontaneously if the temperature is elevated or following speciï¬c enzymatic processes) leads to the accumulation of NADHX and NADPHX, which are toxic and can inhibit a number of dehydrogenases. Highly conserved dehydrataseNAD(P)HX Dehydratase (NAXD) is one of the key intra  cellular NADHX/NADPHX repair enzymes. Materials and Methods: We describe 6 unrelated children with generally fever induced recurrent episodic neurological impairment and/or cardiac failure with early demise, and its genetic basis. Results: Genomic sequencing revealed biallelic NAXD variants in all cases, and in silico analyses predicting potential pathogenicity for each of them. Pathogenicity wasfunctionally validated using patient ï¬broblasts through a combination of transcript analysis (splicing abnormality in one case), demonstration of markedly elevated S NADHX,R NADHX and cyclic NADHX, impaired mitochondrial function, and reduced viability in culture media containing galactose and azide but not glucose. Transduction withwildtype NAXD restored damaged metabolite levels back to normal. Finally, in vitro studies revealed that the two missense variants [(p.(Gly63Ser) and p.(Arg608Cys)] werethermolabile, and speci ï¬c ATP dependent NADHX dehy  dratase activity showed abnormal enzyme kinetics. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst report of a human disorder caused by NAXD de ï¬ciency, showing remarkable clinical overlap with the other known defect of the NADH/NADPH repair pathway, NAXE de ï¬ciency.

Deletion cause Williams Beuren syn  drome (WBS) characterized by hypersociability, anxiety and intellectual disability, while duplication give rise to 7qduplication syndrome (7DupASD) with severe impairments in language, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the well established genetic underpinnings of thesedisorders effective treatments are unavailable. Converging evidence points to GTF2I as a major player mediating the cognitive behavioral phenotype associated with WBS and7DupASD. We showed previously in patient derived iPSC and neural progenitors that GTF2I associates with LSD1 to suppress expression of genes involved in neuronal function,whereas inhibition of LSD1 restored gene expression balance. Here we used mouse models together with patient derived 3D cortical organoids and single cell transcriptomics to dissectthe molecular foundations of WBS and 7DupASD. Mice with duplication of GTF2I faithfully recapitulated the ASD like phenotype in the three chambered sociability apparatus.Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1 with an irreversible inhibitor, rescued the ASD like phenotype. Bulk and single cell RNAseq from cortical organoids revealed divergent dynam ics of neuronal maturation with accelerated maturation in 7DupASD and decelerated in WBS organoids resulting in a divergent neural fate, which was con ï¬rmed by relative abundance of basal progenitor populations. Strikingly, knockdown of GTF2I in 7DupASD organoids rescued neu  ronal maturation rate to control levels. These ï¬ndings suggest that GTF2I LSD1 axis plays a critical role in social behavior and cognition by controlling the timing of cortical maturation. A. Lopez Tobon: None. R. Shyti: None. E.

Here we have used whole exome sequencing to uncover the endo plasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the cau  sative gene of a novel leukodystrophy. This enzyme catalizes the ï¬n a ls t e pi nt h e de novo biosynthesis of ceramides controlling the conv ersion of dihydroceramide (DhCer) to ceramide (Cer), and may play intriguing roles in antiapoptotic, and anabolic and insulin signalling.Through international collaborative networks, we have identi ï¬ed eighteen patients from twelve unrelated families carrying biallelic de leterious variants in the DEGS1 gene. Common features among the cases include severe hypomyelination, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum on MRI, accompanied by speechabnormalities, developmental delay and intellectual dis  ability, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 and ceramide metabolism in myelin development and maintenance.Patients âï¬broblasts exhibited accumulation of DhCer, which increased ROS production. Knockdown of the DEGS1 ortholog in Danio rerio recapitulated the bio  chemical imbalance of ceram ides, showed diminished numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and impaired locomotor abilities. The enzymatic inhibition of cer amide synthase, one step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, by the multiple sclerosis treatment Fingolimod (FTY720), restored the critic al DhCer/Cer balance, and ameliorated the cellular and locomotor phenotypes in the zebra ï¬sh model. These results pave the way to clinical translation, illustrating the tr ansformative, timely impact of clinical genomics in patient care.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col  laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var  iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand  or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno  types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

Human accelerated regions (HARs) repre  sent conserved genomic loci with elevated divergence in humans compared to other primate and non primate species.At least some HARs are thought to contribute to neurode  velopmental functions underlying the unique social and behavioral traits of humans. If some HARs regulate human speciï¬c social and behavioral traits, then mutations would likely impact cognitive and social disorders. Recent studies support the role of HARs in complex neurodevelopmentalfunctions and associated disorders including Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia. Strikingly, through large scale whole genome and targeted HAR omesequencing we ï¬nd, for the ï¬rst time, that rare noncoding mutations in neurally active HARs contribute to simplex, multiplex, and consanguineous ASD cases. These mutationshighlight more than 20 HARs with putative essential roles in neural development. Functional validation of candidate HARs and underlying mutations using chromatin interac tion sequencing, high throughput reporter assays, and transgenic mice allowed for further functional character  ization of inherited HAR mutations in active regulatoryelements for RBFOX1 ,CUX1, PTBP2, GPC4, CDKL5 , and other genes implicated in neural function, autism spectrum disorder, or both.

Here, we systematically dissected the functional networks associatedwith 16p11.2 RGD from transcriptome analyses of 70 mice with reciprocal CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region across cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, as well as liver, white andbrown adipose tissues in a subset of 16 mice (n ,250 samples). We integrated these data with brain tissues from a Kctd13 mouse model (a putative driver of 16p11.2 neu  roanatomical phenotypes, n ,50), and CRISPR engi  neered, isogenic 16p11.2 iPSC derived NSCs (n ,25) and induced neurons (n ,27). The strongest magnitude of effect sizes from 7qF3 were observed across brain regions by comparison to non brain tissues (cortex 7qF3 region aver  age p value ,8.80E 35; non brain p ,0.0013), re ï¬ecting the ~3x higher basal expression changes. Coexpression network analyses isolated a consistent module of 16p11.2 genes, as well as a module that was highly enriched forconstrained genes (ExAC pLI â¥0.9), autism associated genes, early fetal development coexpression networks derived from BrainSpan, and neurological phenotypes andprocesses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in this âconstrained âmodule network; moreover, DEGs from the Kctd13 mouse coalesced into this samemodule (cortex enrichment p ,7.82E 41), suggesting overlap in altered transcriptional networks between full length CNV and deletion of KCTD13 alone. These analysesidentify a tissue speci ï¬c impact of 16p11.2 RGD that converges on a module of co expressed genes that are intolerant to genetic perturbation and associated with criticalprocesses in human neurodevelopment.

3080,77,D The role of next generation sequencing in the differential diagnosis of congenital iris anomalies,P02.02,,"Genetics Department, IIS FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az  CIBERER, UAM, Madrid, Spain Abnormal development of the iris is a feature of severalcongenital ocular malformations. Classical aniridia, the most common form, is a panocular disease characterized by iris and foveal hypoplasia, keratopathy, cataracts andglaucoma, caused by PAX6 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. The pre  sence of variable expressivity and phenotypic overlapping with other types of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD)hinders the genetic characterization of atypical presentations of aniridia. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of NGS to improve the clinical diagnosis of these pathologies. Acohort of 106 families was studied, including cases with classical aniridia or atypical forms (iris hypoplasia, atrophy or coloboma). The entire PAX6 gene and other 260 genes associated with ocular malformations were analyzed using custom targeted NGS and aCGH approaches, as well as clinical or whole exome and/or Sanger sequencing. About82% of the cases presented likely pathogenic variants or CNVs in 5 different genes. Defects in PAX6 explain 75% of cases, including not only all characterized cases withclassical aniridia, but also 30% of patients with more atypical presentations, in whom LOF or atypical missense and non coding variants were identi ï¬ed, respectively. Other aniridia like patients presented pathogenic variants in ASD  related genes or variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance in candidate genes. Molecular analysis of iris malformationspresents high diagnostic yield not only in cases with classical aniridia (95%) but also in patients with aniridia  like phenotypes (>50%). Our work evidences the clinicalutility of differential genetic studies based on NGS in patients with congenital iris anomalies.

Digenic inheritance among COL4A3 COL4A5 or their concomitance with other glomerulopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD) related genes, has been recently proposed to explain the variable phenotypic expression andincomplete penetrance frequently observed in AS patients.1244Materials and Methods: NGS analysis of 55 glomer  ulopathy and CKD related genes was performed in a group of 56 unrelated Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In all patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. Overall, 17 known and 32 novel, likely pathogenic alterations in COL4A3  COL4A5 were identi ï¬ed. The inheritance was X linked in 73% of cases, remaining 9% autosomal recessive and 18% were dominant AS/TBMN.

Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism spectrum disorder may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1  dependent deregulation of genes. Furthermore, this is theï¬rst report of achalasia being caused by a heterozygous gene deletion. H. FrÃ¶hlich: None. M. Kollmeyer: None. M. Stuhlin  ger: None. V. Linz: None. D. Groneberg: None. A.

The resulting de ï¬ciency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase, and accumulation of the pro in ï¬ammatory sphingolipid ceramide, causes a broad spectrum of symptoms and disease severity which may delay diagnosisor lead to misdiagnosis. The ongoing study described here is the ï¬rst comprehensive, systematic clinical study of the natural history of Farber disease. Methods: The Observational and Cross Sectional Cohort Study of the Natural History and Phenotypic Spectrum of Farber Disease (NCT03233841) is designed to collect ret rospective and prospective data including demographics, clinical presentation, phenotype, and diagnostic history of patients diagnosed with Farber disease who have or havenot undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), along with speci ï¬c prospective clinical evaluations in living patients. Results: From November 2017 to December 2018, 42 patients (25 living, 17 deceased) have been enrolled in the study. The average age of the living patients is 9 years(range 1 to 28 years). Average time from onset of ï¬rst symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years (range < 1 to 12 years). Patient countries of birth include Afghanistan, Argentina,Canada, Egypt, Germany, India, Iraq, Italy, Mexico, Swe  den, Syria, Turkey, and the USA. Conclusions: Patients representing the breadth of the phenotypic spectrum of Farber disease, from rapidly pro  gressive (severe), to slowly progressive (attenuated) have1332been enrolled from 15 centers (9 countries). Demographic data and numbers of patients enrolled indicate that Farber disease is likely not as rare as previously thought. E. Sundberg: B.

It varies from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifesta tions and an increased risk of toxicity from 5  ï¬uorouracil treatment. Materials and Methods: A child with severe autistic behavior, intellectual disability (no speech at 6 years old) and family history   aunt with mental retardation, was referred for genetic counseling. Metabolic screening wasperformed in urine sample by dipstick   glucose, ketone, pH, and reducing sugars, followed by LC MS/MS blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines and GC/MS urine organicacids analysis. Mutations in DPYD gene are reported in DPD de ï¬ciency patients. The gene was investigated by direct Sanger sequencing in proband and his parents. Results: Elevated levels of thymine and uracil were detected by GC/MS urine test which was suggestive of DPD deï¬ciency.

Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Approximately 10% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) remainwithout a molecular diagnosis (AS like). Whole exome sequencing in a cohort of 17 AS like patients led to the identi ï¬cation of 11 pathogenic/likely pathogenic de novo variants in 10 genes involved in neurodevelopment disorders, not previously associated with AS. Clinical re  evaluation was performed in order to establish thegenotype phenotype correlation in the molecularly diag  nosed patients. Materials and Methods: The clinical characteristics of the 11 patients were reviewed for the presence of the con  sistent and frequent AS clinical features. Additional dis  tinctive clinical features were collected and compared withthe clinical phenotypes reported in the literature in patients carrying pathogenic variants in the identi ï¬ed genes. Results: Clinical re evaluation showed that the 11 patients meet the consistent and almost all of the frequent features of AS. The additional clinical ï¬ndings in patients carrying variants in SMARCE1, KIF1A, SYNGAP1 and SLC6A1 genes ï¬t with the phenotypes reported in patients with pathogenic variants in the same genes. On the otherhand, patients carrying variants in SATB2, ASXL3, SPTAN1 and LAS1L genes present some but not all the consistent features attributed to these genes. Conclusion: Molecular heterogeneity in AS like patients, together with the presence of distinctive clinical features in some of them, indicates that AS like is made up by differentclinical entities overlapping phenotypically with AS, mak  ing them dif ï¬cult to distinguish.

The majority of reported patients harbored de novo loss of function (LoF) variants. To date, the phenotype of only four patients has been precisely described in the literature, contrasting with the relative frequency of detection of such LoF GATAD2B variants. Here, we describe 10 patients with con ï¬rmed LoF GATAD2B variants and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Methods: Patients were included by contacting referent clinicians from several French genetics departments. Results: Developmental delay was severe with a median age of 2.4 years (range [2 5]) for independent walking and of 2.75 years (range [1 4]) for ï¬rst spoken words. They showed very little subsequent progress, one patientremaining non verbal at age 30 years. ID was mostly moderate, with only one severe and one mild case, which differs from the original description of severe ID. Mostcommon dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, downturned mouth and, anomalies of the extremities. Conversely, prenatal compli cations, non cerebral organ malformations, epilepsy and autistic behaviour were very rare. One patient presented asthma and recurrent respiratory infections, another onepresented severe feeding dif ï¬culties and developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and IgG de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: NGS based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of GATAD2B variations. Better knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for a cor  rect interpretation of the molecular results and for anaccurate management of these patients. G. Vera: None. A. Sorlin: None. G.

Material and Methods: In a collaborative initiative we have identi ï¬ed 11 patients with neurodevelopmental dis  orders and ASD phenotype with loss of function(LoF) mutations in the ASXL3 gene. Exome sequencing was used as a diagnostic tool and Sanger sequencing was used forfamilial segregation. The mutational spectrum of ASXL3 was revised in public_data (PubMed, Clinvar, SFARI). Results: We identi ï¬ed 10 new ASXL3 LoF variants and one recurrent mutation (c.3106C>T;p.Arg1036Ter).

The ï¬rst patient showed severe developmental delay, thin corpus callosum (CC), prominent supraorbital ridges withsynophrys, deep set eyes and ï¬eshy earlobes: in order to validate our clinical suspicion of Borjeson Forssman Lehmann syndrome (BFLS), we performed PHF6 muta  tional analysis that revealed a de novo missense mutation within the PHD type 2 domain; X inactivation analysis showed skewed X inactivation in blood lymphocytes. The second patient had severe delayed language development, intellectual disability (ID), hypermetropia, strabismus,linear skin hyperpigmentation and increasing obesity: PWS AS test and array CGH resulted normal. Whole  exome sequencing (WES), surprisingly, disclosed a de novo missense mutation in PHF6 , in the same functional domain as our ï¬rst patient; in this case, X inactivation analysis showed normal X inactivation in blood lymphocytes. BFLSis an X linked recessive disease, characterized by ID, epilepsy, hypogonadism, hypometabolism, obesity and a typical facial gestalt; female carriers usually not show anyï¬ndings or present only mild symptoms. To date, de novo aberrations in PHF6 were reported in 13 females with a variable phenotype, characterized by ID, characteristicfacial features, ï¬ngers and dental anomalies, only partially overlapping with BFSL as described in males. Molecular genetics has opened a new path to understand thecomplexity of ID, mostly in female patients, where we would tend to exclude a priori a known as X linked recessive condition. However, in cases with heterogeneousID phenotypes, WES is the instrument to address the exact diagnosis, as suggested in our second case. A. Pagliazzi: None. R. Artuso: None. G. Tra ï¬cante: None.

Homozygosity for the Æ4 allele increases AD risk, with homozygotes estimated having up to 60 70% lifetime risk (penetrance), withaverage age of onset ~70 years. Some Æ4 homozygotes live >75 without AD, suggesting protective factors, yet are rarely ascertained. We sought to test APOE haplotypes against cognitive function/dementia in a longitudinal study and identify Æ4 homozygotes aged >75 years without AD. Methods: We sequenced 13,131 healthy elderly partici  pants in the ASPREE study. At baseline, participants had no history of cardiovascular disease or dementia, and passed a general cognition screen (Modi ï¬ed Mini Mental State Examination â¥78), average age 74 years. We administered different cognitive tests (general cognition, verbal learning/ memory, verbal ï¬uency, processing speed) over ï¬ve years. We collected clinical outcome data on a range of endpoints, and associated each APOE haplotype with speci ï¬c cogni  tive functions and dementia. Results: APOE frequencies aligned with other cohorts (Æ3/Æ3,62.3%, Æ3/Æ4,21.0%, Æ2/Æ3,12.5%, Æ2/ Æ2,0.6%, Æ4/Æ4,1.5%). Yet we observed notable differ  ences in cognitive function (verbal learning/ memory), after controlling for demographic and clinical risk factors. We quanti ï¬ed the effect of each APOE haplotype on dementia risk and age of onset. We identi ï¬ed 200 Æ4 homozygous, of whom after median 4.7 years follow up, only 14 reached the dementia endpoint (7% penetrance).

Large genome rearrangements are being identi ï¬ed in ASD as an under  lying cause for development of this syndrome. These rearrangements are mostly deletions, but duplications canbe found. We present case of twin boys with APBA2 gene duplication. Materials and Methods: Twin boys, age 9 were referred to genetic counseling and testing with diagnosed ASD (DSM IV). DNA was isolated from buccal swabs of the boys, and 3 ml of whole blood from parents. Parents pro vided completed questionnaires for tick disorders in chil  dren as well as Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ).

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together.

Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028).

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations.

Sleep is disturbed in upto 80% of affected youths with ASD. Genes underlying the circadian rhythm are proposed to elucidate sleep and other timing problems in individuals with ASD. Our ï¬rst aim investigates whether copy number variants (CNVs) encom  passing core circadian clock genes, circadian pathway genes, and sleep trait candidate genes, detected fromprevious large genome wide association studies, areAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1423signiï¬cantly overrepresented in ASD individuals compared to their unaffected siblings. Material and Methods: We used microarray data from probands with ASD (n ,2926) and their unaffected siblings (n,2434) from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). CNVs were called, validated, and subsequently ï¬ltered using established pipelines and detection algorithms (PennCNV, QuantiSNP, SnipPeep). Results: Fisher âs exact test reveal that CNVs encom  passed in core circadian clock genes, circadian pathway genes, and sleep trait candidate genes are signi ï¬cantly overrepresented in probands with ASD in comparison totheir unaffected siblings (p ,0.003; Odds ratio 1.6; CI95% [1.2 ; 2.3]). Conclusions: These preliminary results are the ï¬rst to implicate a broad network of sleep related genes in the etiology of ASD. Using whole exome sequencing (WES) data from the SSC, future investigations will evaluate therepresentation of probands âSNPs within sleep related genes in comparison to their unaffected siblings. Furthermore, SNP set Kernel Association Test (SKAT) using probands â WES and corresponding phenotypic sleep observations will identify candidate SNPs that associate signi ï¬cantly with disturbed sleep traits in individuals with ASD.

Vincent1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada,2Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,3Queen âs University,, Kingston, ON, Canada, 4University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Worcester, MA, United States Introduction: Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein, playing a critical role in multiple processes, including ribosome assembly and maturation, chromatin decondensa tion, and pre rRNA transcription. Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p.Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen  cing of an autism spectrum disorder trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C  terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis  localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p.Gly664*, shows a very similar effect on the location of the NCL protein, thus con ï¬rming the presence of the nucleolar location signal of NCL protein in this region. FRAP showssigniï¬cant changes in the kinetics and mobility of mutant NCL protein in the nucleoplasm. Conclusions: Several other studies have also reported de novo mutations in NCL in ASD or neurodevelopmental dis  orders.

Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Madrid, SpainIntroduction: The Spanish Undiagnosed Rare Diseases Program (SpainUDP) performs extended genetic analyses and deep phenotyping to get a de ï¬nite diagnosis in rare syndrome cases. We present the case of a 3 year old male with severe generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness together with neurodevelopmental delay. He presentsmicrocephaly and dysmorphic features highlighting micro  retrognathy, low set ears and hypertelorism. Materials and Methods: Trio based exome analysis was carried out by using Nextera Truseq Rapid Enrichment kit and sequenced in NextSeq500 (Illumina). Results: The exome analysis revealed a novel mutation consisting on a small de novo 30 bp deletion in exon 9 of AUTS2 gene (Autism susceptibility candidate 2, OMIM:607270), which allowed the diagnosis of this patientas AUTS2 Syndrome or Mental Retardation, autosomal dominant 26 (OMIM:615834). AUTS2 gene is involved in the development of neurological disorders. Alterations ofAUTS2 gene were described as a result of genomic rear  rangements, although large copy number variations and intragenic deletions or mutations have also been describedto cause this syndrome. It is noteworthy that the deletion found in this patient included the transcription start site of the short isoform of the gene, which plays an important rolein brain development. The gene expression analysis showed that the deletion causes reduction in the level of expression not only of the short isoform but also of the completetranscript of the gene. Conclusions: This case helps in establishing the genotype phenotype correlation adding more evidence tothe role of mutations speci ï¬cally affecting the short isoform for the development of a severe phenotype.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT  qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail  able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers.Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange  ment.

3185,552,B Bringing genetics into clinical practice: antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy in 5q associated spinal muscular atrophy (SMA),P10.03,,"L. MÃ¼schen1, O. Abu Fares2, F. GÃ¶tz2, O. Schreiber  Katz1, S. Petri11Department of Neurology, Hannover, Germany,2Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Hannover, Germany Introduction: The neuromuscular disorder SMA is the most frequent genetic cause of death in children. Due tolower motor neuron loss caused by homozygous deletions in the survival of motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene patients suffer from progressive muscular atrophy and paralysis.Whereas SMA 1 and 2 patients never walk independently, SMA 3 patients present with a milder phenotype and later onset mainly attributable to higher copy numbers of theonly partially functional SMN2 gene. In 2017 the intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) Nusinersen has been approved as ï¬rst treatment for all types of SMA by the EU, based on results from phase 3 trials in pediatric patients. Nusinersen alters the splicing of SMN2 pre mRNA in order to increase production of full lengthSMN protein. Long term evaluation of treatment effects and impact of SMN2 carrier status in adult SMA patients under ASO therapy is urgently needed. Materials and Methods: In our center, 24 patients aged 18 65 years have been treated with intrathecal loading doses of Nusinersen at day 1, 14, 28 and 63, followed by main tenance doses every 4 months so far. Treatment ef ï¬cacy was assessed by monitoring of muscular functions and patient reported outcome measures in correlation to theSMN2 carrier status. Results: Intrathecal administration either by conventional or computed tomography (CT) guided lumbar puncture waswell tolerated. No patient has developed communicating hydrocephalus. First objective and subjective results indi  cate a bene ï¬t in motor function in dependence of disease severity and SMA type which correlates to the SMN2 copy number. A. Osmanovic: None. G.

Biomedicine, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden,7Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden We recently reported novel recurrent germline and somatic mutations in the myosin Vb motor gene ( MYO5B )i n malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PCC/PGL),an adolescent/adult counterpart to neuroblastoma arising from the same neural crest origin. Here, we have explored the functional impact of three MYO5B missense mutations(p.L587P, p.G1611S, and p.R1641C) with respect to proliferation, migration and intracellular traf ï¬cking in vitro . MYO5B mutated cDNA clones (pCMV6 MYO5B Myc DKK tagged) were generated by site directed mutagenesis and stably transfected into human embryonic1594kidney cells (HEK293) and SK N AS neuroblastoma cells. All three MYO5B mutants demonstrated a signi ï¬cantly increased proliferation rate compared to MYO5B wild type clones (p<0.001). The Scratch wound assay also indicated an increased migration rate (p<0.05) in cells harboring the two somatic variants p.L587P (located in the motor domain)and p.G1611S (located in the tail dilute domain). Moreover, investigating the endocytic recycling pathway by the transferrin assay showed an increased transferrin uptake inp.L587P and p.G1611S mutants, indicating a disturbed intracellular transport. Immunohistochemistry and transcrip  tomic analysis of 31 primary PCC/PGL tumor cases show adifferential expression of MYO5B mRNA and protein levels in some malignant PGLs, as well as a changed subcellular localization of MYO5B in one PGL caseharboring an acquired p.G1611S MYO5B mutation.

3300,53, Genetic epigenetic interactions: mechanistic insights and practical applications,S20.2,,"United States Our lab, with our collaborators, has been working to understand genetic epigenetic interactions that occur in cis and in trans. Haplotype dependent allele speci ï¬c DNA methylation (hap ASM) is a pervasive phenomenon thatreï¬ects cis acting effects of local DNA sequences on local CpG methylation patterns in human cells and tissues. Differential DNA methylation in Down syndrome (DS DM)is an interesting trans acting effect, in which the presence of the extra chromosome 21 leads to recurrent changes in CpG methylation patterns at loci distributed throughout thegenome. I will brie ï¬y cover both topics, emphasizing the practical utility of hap ASM mapping as a post GWASapproach for homing in on mechanistically informative disease associated regulatory sequence variants, and the analysis of DS DM to test mechanistic hypotheses for how DNA methylation patterns are shaped in mammalian genomes.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti  mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

Leveraging up to 23 years of prospective data from the population based FINRISK study (n ,21,951), we built genome wide PRSs with >6 million variants forcoronary heart disease (CHD), atrial ï¬brillation (AF), type 2 diabetes (T2D), breast cancer, and prostate cancer and tested their 1) associations with incident cases, 2) impact onage at disease onset, and 3) impact in prediction alongside established clinical risk factors.1128A high PRS (>97.5thpercentile) was strongly associated with higher disease incidence (hazard ratios 3.73 â38.29 for top vs bottom 2.5%, p values 0.0003 â6.65x10â22). This risk increase translated into earlier disease onset by 9 to 29 years in the high risk group. For example, for T2D the age at onset in the high risk group was 29.0 years earlier than inthe low risk group. Of 297 early onset CHD (age <55) cases, the clinical ASCVD risk calculator for cardiovascular diseases identi ï¬ed only 13.1% as high risk ( â¥7.5%); high (>80 thpercen  tile) CHD PRS was the only risk factor in 31.0% and a familial hypercholesterolemia mutation was present in0.3%. Excluding age as a risk factor, the PRS had a higher effect for CHD risk than did the routinely measured clinical risk factors combined, with similar ï¬ndings for AF and T2D.

Themain reason is a defective glomerular ï¬ltration barrier allowing the passage of serum proteins, including albumin, into the urine. Largely overlooked, a failure of reabsorbingtheï¬ltered proteins in the proximal tubular segment can also lead to a mild tubular proteinuria, but it is unclear if it is harmful for the kidney. Here, we combine targeted andexome sequencing to explore the contribution of tubular genes to chronic subnephrotic proteinuria (0,5 3 g/24h). Altogether, we identi ï¬ed 24 patients with recessive mutations in the tubular uptake receptor cubilin ( CUBN) . Meta analyzing our in house genetic database, we further identify a signi ï¬cant association between loss of function CUBN mutations and proteinuric conditions. The tubular proteinuria in the CUBN patients was atypical, lacking important tubular proteinuria markers and consisting ofmore than 50% albumin. Importantly, the renal function was normal, even in old patients, suggesting that the proteinuria is benign. All identi ï¬ed mutations localize to the C terminal half of the protein, which is in contrast to the known N terminal Imerslund GrÃ¤sbeck mutations for CUBN featured by Vitamin B12 malabsorption in addition to the proteinuria. Some mutations have an allele frequency of 0.5% suggesting that this kind of proteinuria is not uncommon. This is supported by the gnomAD databaseshowing a high prevalence of damaging CUBN variants, mostly localizing to the C terminal half. In summary, we identify C terminal CUBN mutations as a common but benign cause of chronic proteinuria. M. Bedin: None. O. Boyer: None. A. Servais: None. L. Villoing GaudÃ©: None. O. Gribouval: None.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) liver iron, compared to circulating iron traits,permit detection of liver speci ï¬c susceptibility loci. We performed the ï¬rst GWAS of MRI determined liver iron in 8,289 individuals in UK Biobank and validated ourresults in 1,513 individuals from DIRECT. Liver iron was calculated from MRI data using LiverMultiScanTM. We used GEMMA, which corrects for relatedness and popula tion structure, and adjusted our model for age, sex, BMI and genotyping array. We identi ï¬ed three independent genetic variants (rs1800562 & rs1799945 in HFE, rs855791 in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron (P < 5x10 8). Both HFE and TMPRSS6 are involved in hepcidin production, the keyhormone responsible for iron balance in the body. We estimated the heritability of liver iron to be 7.39%. The most genetically correlated traits in LD score regressionanalysis were transferrin (rG ,â0.78) and ferritin (rG , 1.24) with nominal signi ï¬cant correlation. In our Mendelian randomisation analysis, we found some evidence that highercentral obesity, measured as waist to hip ratio, is casually associated with higher liver iron content (IVW P ,0.003). Phenome wide association analysis demonstrates sharedaetiology of elevated liver iron with high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, extrahepatic malignancies, neuropsychiatric, endocrine and rheumatological conditions, and an inverseassociation with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease. Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying excess liver iron are likely systemic not organ speciï¬c. Our data provides new insights into the biology of liver iron and its link to metabolic and non metabolic dis ease outcomes.H.R. Wilman: None. C.A. Parisinos: None. N. Ata  baki pasdar: None. M.

The second pregnancy ended as a missed abortion. Karyotyping was perfomed to the couple and results were normal kar  yotypes. Couple negated the family burden, but X linkedand primary autosomal recessive microcephaly was suspected. Materials and methods: After fetal ultrasonogram showing recurrent primary microcephaly in the third pregnancy, fetal blood sample obtained by cordocentesis. The sample was used for standard cytogenetic analysis,aCGH and clinical exome next generation sequencing. Results: The fetal karyotyping showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY), con ï¬rmed by aCGH analysis. Clinical exome testing and bioinformatic analysis of the genes known to be associated with microcephaly and similar pathological conditions detected pathogenic and likelypathogenic variant in the ASPM (abnormal spindle like microcephaly associated) gene. Pathogenic variant was ASPM c.7324C> T, known stop gained mutation with conï¬rmed maternal origin. Likely pathogenic variant was newely described fremeshift deletion ASPM c.10148 delC, with con ï¬rmed paternal origin. Conclusions: Comprehensive genetic testing of affected fetus showed compound heterozygous mutations in ASPM gene, designed as MCPH5 (microcephaly primary heredi tary) locus. An autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance of the detected mutations is most likely involved in the formation of primary congenital microcephaly.Patients are genetically informed about the mode of inheritance of these mutations, possibility of prenatal testing, as well as of the possibility of in vitro fertilizationfor the purpose of preimplantation genetic diagnosis of detected mutations.

De novo missense variants in this gene have been linked to developmental disorders (DD) in a large scale study ofpatients with severe undiagnosed DD (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Only ï¬ve patients have been reported to date and clinical data remains very scarce. We report a new patientwith COL4A3BP  related intellectual disability (ID) aiming to contribute to the recognition of this condition. Materials and methods: Clinical data was collected from the patient âs medical records and compared with previous reports from scienti ï¬c literature and databases. Results: A 5 year old girl with unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery, presented with postnatal microcephaly, axial hypotonia, and severe global864 J. del Picchiadevelopmental delay. Short stature and facial dysmorphisms were noted and, at 24 months, she developed generalized seizures. Currently, she does not walk unaided, says only one word, and has poor visual contact and marked stereotypic behavior with bruxism. Whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a de novo pathogenic variant in COL4A3BP (S260L). Conclusions: This missense variant was previously found in 4 out of 5 known patients, suggesting a mutational hotspot in this gene. Former functional evidence indicates itresults in intracellular imbalances in ceramide, pivotal to the synthesis of sphingolipids. Our case has signi ï¬cant overlap with clinical data from previous patients.

Chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) has offered a high detection rate of small and large CNVs associated with ASD, and ledto discovery of new autism genes. We report on the results of chromosomal CMA investigation in a group of ASDs patients. Eighty patients were referred to our laboratory forgenetic testing with ASDs as part of a broad phenotype including ID or other clinical features. A complete clinical evaluation was performed with focus on psychiatric exam ination and psychological evaluation with speci ï¬c ASDs tests (ADOS, ADI R). Array CGH completed with kar  yotyping, FISH and qPCR tests were performed. A total of21 pathological CNVs (14 deletions and 7 duplications), with a median length of 3.7 Mb were detected in 17 patients. The involved genomic regions overlap 550 OMIMgenes. Besides well described syndromic regions associated with ASDs (e.g. deletions of 1q21.1, 22q13.3, 22q11.2, MBD5; Xq28 duplication), other genomic regions, rarelyreported in patients with ASDs were identi ï¬ed (deletion of 8p11.2p21.2, 9q34.1, 9p13, duplication of 7p22.2p22.1 , CHRNA7) ; thus having the potential to reveal new ASD genes.

Pizzuti1 1Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy,2Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza IRCCS Foundation, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures 2 (SMABF2) is a rare autosomal recessiveneuromuscular disorder characterized by arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and prenatal fractures. Reported patients present biallelic loss of function single nucleotidevariants in ASCC1 gene, encoding a subunit of the tran  scriptional coactivator ASC 1 complex. We describe the ï¬rst SMABF2 case with documented prenatal disease evo  lution, caused by an in frame microdeletion and a nonsense nucleotide variant in a stillbirth. Materials and methods: The stillbirth, born from non  consanguineous parents, presented hydrops, lower limbs hyperextension with bending of the hips, bilateral club foot and congenital fractures. Prenatal ultrasound had showedbilateral club foot, closed ï¬sts and fetal biometric para  meters at middle lower limits. Microarray analysis was performed on DNA extracted from umbilical cord. Datawere analyzed by CytoGenomics software. Next Generation Sequencing analysis was performed using the TruSightOne sequencing panel kit. NGS data were processed andanalyzed using an in house implemented pipeline. Results: A 64Kb microdeletion, involving four exons of ASCC1, was detected by microarray analysis. NGS discloseda single nucleotide variant of the same gene (c.1027C>T; p. Arg343*), resulting in a premature termination codon. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst case of ASCC1 due to an exonic microdeletion and a nucleotide variant in compound heterozygosity, expanding the mutational spectrum of this gene. This case provides further evidence that exonic copynumber variants are an underestimated cause of disease  alleles and that the integrated use of the last generation genetic analysis tools, together with careful clinicalevaluations, are fundamental for the characterization of rare diseases even in prenatal setting.

3374,255, Neurodevelopmental disorders and chromatin remodel ing dysregulation: the lessons from Kabuki syndromespectrum and clinical presentation of Tunisian cases,P11.056,,"Kaabi, W. Ltaif, S. Aloulou, S. Mallek, S. Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ï¬lled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen  tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ï¬nally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ï¬ve cardinal manifestations of KB deï¬ned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ï¬nitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ï¬rmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N.B. Abdelmoula: B.

However, the consequences of the mutations on PLD1 protein function and the mechanism by which PLD1 dysfunction leads tocongenital valve abnormalities remained unknown. Methods: We established an international cohort of patients with autosomal recessive mutations in PLD1 .W e assessed the location of the disease causing missense mutations on the 3 dimensional structure of PLD1 and testedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 43their effect on PLD1 enzymatic activity in a cellular assay.

Results: We identi ï¬ed 26 patients with bi allelic PLD1 mutations. While most patients presented with right sidedcongenital cardiac valve defects (24/26), two patients displayed isolated severe fetal/neonatal cardiomyopathy. Using haplotype analyses, we established that p.I668F is afounder mutation among the Ashkenazi Jews (AJS, minor  allele frequency in gnomAD ASJ ,2%). We found that disease causing PLD1 missense mutations cluster in regions of the protein critical for catalytic activity. Correspondingly, a drastic reduction in enzymatic activity was observed for the mutant proteins. We demonstrate that PLD1 inhibitiondecreases EndoMT, an established pivotal early step in valvulogenesis. Conclusion: We here provide the genetic and phenotypic characterization of the largest cohort of PLD1 patients.

Recently, clinical reas  sessment highlighted the high prevalence of gastrointestinal(GI) defects in ASD. Transient suppression of chd8 in zebra ï¬sh led to a reduced number of enteric neurons and a decreased gut mobility which likely drive the GI problems(Bernier et al. Cell, 2014). Materials and Methods: To understand how the loss of chd8 causes the loss of mature enteric neurons, we generated and characterized a stable mutant zebra ï¬sh line: Tg(chd8 sa19827;phox2bb:GFP ) in which the neuronal pro  genitors (i.e. enteric neural crest cells, eNCCs) are labeledwith GFP. Results: First, we observed a migration delay and reduced proliferation of eNCCs during early developmentand a decreased number of mature neurons and more speciï¬cally serotonergic neurons at 5 days post fertilization. Second, transcriptomic analyses of eNCCs revealed theupregulation of the serotonin receptor htr6 and the dysregulation of several actors of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity and RhoA pathways, extracellular matrix compo nents, and several genes from the human morbid genome. Third, behavioral analyses showed i) hyperactivity of the mutant chd8 larvae and ii) normal sociability and no aggressive behavior in the adult mutants. Conclusion: We showed that the decreased number of enteric neurons in absence of chd8 is due to a combination of proliferation, migration and differentiation defects of the eNCCs. Moreover, our transcriptomic data identi ï¬ed druggable targets in chd8  associated signaling pathwaysand we are currently performing rescue experiments with small molecules in the chd8 mutants.

Pre synaptic disorders, characterized bycongenital nystagmus and photophobia, night blindness, are known as cone rod synaptic disorder (CRSD) can be mis  taken for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Full  ï¬eld electroretinogram is crucial for the differential diagnosis, but it can be dif ï¬cult to perform in young children. Here, we report (i) the identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in the RIMS2 gene encoding a pre synaptic protein not yet asso  ciated with human diseases in 3/4 families initially referred for LCA and (ii) the diagnostic adjustment to CRSD withvariable associated alteration including autistic behavior and insulinopathy. Methods : Exome sequencing combined with targeted RIMS2 testing were performed in 46 prescreened patients with CRSD and 94 with LCA. Biallelic RIMS2 mutated cases underwent ophthalmologic, neurologic and metabolicassessment. RIMS2 immunostaining was performed on human retina, brain and pancreas. Nonsense variants were functionally investigated in mammalian cells. Results.Biallelic RIMS2 sequence variants were found in four unrelated families. RIMS2, a protein regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis localizes in the human retinal outerplexiform layer, Purkinje cells and pancreatic islets. Apart from CRSD, neurodevelopmental disease was observed in all cases, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in the eldestpatient.?Nonsense variants lead to truncated RIMS2 and decreased insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Conclusion : This is the ï¬rst report of syndromic CRSD with neurodevelopmental or pancreatic involvement due to RIMS2 loss of function. The disease presentation is con  sistent with the localization and function of RIMS2. S. Mechaussier: None. B. Almoallem: None. C. Zeitz: None. K. Van Schil: None. L. Jeddawi: None. J.

Introduction: Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that can be isolatedor syndromic. Biallelic ALDH1A3 variants are responsible for 11% of recessive AM cases, mostly described in consanguineous families, and present severe bilateral AM with variable neurodevelopmen tal anomalies. We present six families with biallelic ALDH1A3 variants, further characterising the associated phenotype. Material and Methods: AM individuals from UK, France and Spain were analysed by WES, targeted gene screening and arrays. Results: We identi ï¬ed 6 families: Family 1) with two brothers with bilateral anophthalmia, one present additional developmen tal delay, absent speech and autism with compound heterozygousALDH1A3 variants (c.874G>T:p.(D292Y);c.1393A>T:p.(I465F)); 2) a boy with bilateral anophthalmia, developmental and intellectual delay, seizures and autistic features with compound heterozygous variants (c.845G>C:p.(G282A);c.1459A>G:p.(R487G)); 3) a girl withbilateral microphthalmia and coloboma with compound hetero zygous variants (c.847_849del;p.(G283del);c.953C>A,:p.(S318Y)); 4) a girl with bilateral anophthalmia with a homozygous missense variant (c.1144G>A:p.(G382R)); 5) a boy with bilateral microphthal mia, unilateral coloboma and cataract, with a homozygous splice variant (c.1233 +2T>C) and 6) a boy with bilateral microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, facial dysmorphism with ahomozygous missense variant (c.434C>T:p.A145V). Conclusions: Three of the six families presented with com pound heterozygous variants, highlighting this mode of inheri tance in ALDH1A3 related disorders. Five of 6 families had a variant in the catalytic domain, supporting the importance of this domain,which is critical for substrate selectivity.

Introduction: Alport syndrome (AS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous nephropathy caused by pathogenic variants inCOL4A3, COL4A4 orCOL4A5 . About 85% of AS patients have X linked inheritance, which causes more severe phenotype in males, whereas in females, penetrance depends onX chromosome inactivation pattern. Originating in the MiddleAges COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A p.Gly624Asp is predominant in Central/East Europe and mostly gives mild AS symptoms. Materials and Methods: Next generation sequencing analysis of glomerulopathy and chronic kidney disease related genes panelwas performed in Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In 65 patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. The most frequent was X linked AS caused by 32different COL4A5 variants (75%). A recurrent COL4A5 variant p. Gly624Asp in 15 patients (nine males and six females) was identi ï¬ed. Additionally, four patients with this substitution had pathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 . The clinical course of patients with this genotype was mostly milder than observed in individuals with other COL4A5 variants. They presented only haematuria with or without proteinuria. Of these, two patients alsohad hearing impairment: male with only p.Gly624Asp variant andfemale with additional variant in COL4A3 . Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the genotypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on thegenotype phenotype correlations.

Introduction: Type IV collagen related nephropathy covers a spectrum of hereditary hematuric diseases (thin basementmembrane nephropathy, TBMN; Alport syndrome, AS). Whereas AS results from disease causing variants in COL4A3 5 (autosomal recessive and X linked AS), monoallelic disease causing variants inCOL4A3/4 are associated with TBMN. Methods: Variants of 96 index cases reported between 2009 and 2014 with the clinical tentative diagnosis AS (77/96), TBMN (13/96) or unclear determination of AS/TBMN (6/96) weremeticulously reinterpreted based on ACMG criteria and current amendments.

Results: In total, 84 variants (allocated to 96 cases) and their genotypes have been reassessed ( COL4A3 : 21/84, COL4A4 : 18/84, COL4A5 : 45/84). 64/90 cases included in the further analysis could be classi ï¬ed as solved (original report: 83/90; p< 0.001, Fisher exact test). 26/90 were classi ï¬ed as ânot solved â(original report: 7/ 90), due to inconclusive results on variant (11/90), on genotype(12/90) or both variant and genotype level (3/90).

The pathop hysiological mechanisms are still unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate if this group of patients is burdened by mutations in genes associated with ASD. Methods: We included 147 patients with an unrepaired ASD. We curated a list of ASD candidate genes, and patients wereanalyzed for genetic variants in these genes, using targeted next generation sequencing. We ï¬ltered for protein altering variants (PAVs) with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01 and predictedpathogenicity using the Combined Annotation Dependent Deple tion (CADD) method. The number of rare and pathogenic variants in cases were compared with variants identi ï¬ed in 33,370 controls of European ancestry. Results: We identi ï¬ed 384 rare (MAF < 0.01) PAVs in 59 genes. ASD patients were signi ï¬cantly enriched for very rare (MAF < 0.0001) PAVs compared to controls (P ,0.0001). The frequency of PAVs with CADD score â¥30 was signi ï¬cantly higher in ASD patients, compared to controls (P ,0.0042). Conclusions: Patients with a small, unrepaired ASD were enriched for rare PAVs within 59 ASD candidate disease genes.

First classi ï¬ed into three types (types I, II, and III) based on biochemical manifestations, it was later reclassi ï¬ed into types I (CTLN1, MIM# 215700) and II (CTLN2, MIM# 603471) basedon molecular pathogenesis. It is due to variation in the ASS1 gene located on chromosome 9q43.11. Incidence of variants differs across populations and ethnic groups. A genotype phenotype correlation has been established, although not clearly outlined. Materials and methods: A total of seven families with citrullinemia type 1, four of Lebanese origins, and three others of Syrian, Iraqi, and Kurdish origins were included in our study.Upon informed consent, genomic DNA was isolated fromperipheral blood samples and analysis of ASS1 was carried out. Results: A novel variant c.286C>A, in exon 5 was described in one Lebanese family with early onset and severe clinicalpresentation. Two other homozygous missense variantsc.535T>C, in exon 8 and c.787G>A, in exon 10 were identi ï¬ed in two Lebanese families each presenting with late onset and mild manifestations.

AS is caused by the loss of expression of the maternal copy of theUBE3A gene in 15q11.2 q13 imprinted region. Many genetic mechanisms are involved, of which the most frequent was the deletion of the maternally inherited 15q11.2 q13 region. Materials and Methods: Clinical and genetic analyses of a cohort of 44 patients, referred to our Department of Congenital and Hereditary Diseases from 2004 to 2020. MS PCR was performed for diagnostic con ï¬rmation while FISH, microsatellites study and UBE3A gene sequencing were realized to genetic mechanism determination. Results: We noted one familial form with 6/44 affected cases and 38/44 sporadic ones. The sex ratio was 1,44. The averageage at the ï¬rst presentation was 4 years and at the diagnosis conï¬rmation was 4.5 years. All patients had developmental delay, severe speech impairment and characteristic behavior. Seizures and ataxia were noted in 81.8 and 72.7% of patients, respectively. The physical examination revealed hypopigmenta tion (72.7%), an evocative facial dysmorphia. 70.4%, microce phaly (63.6%) and strabismus (68% ). The follow up was possible for only 59% of patients. The ge netic mechanisms were 15q11 q13 microdeletion (30/44), UBE3A mutations (8/44) and maternal DUP15 (3/44).Conclusion: We studied the largest cohort of AS in Tunisia.

NGS analysis allowed identi ï¬cation of new heterozygotic variant p.Glu367Glyf sTer17 (c.1095_1096delAA) in the ASXL3 gene. This variant is reported in dbSNP database (rs1599562180) and ClinVar Database as likely pathogenic. Mutation was con ï¬rmed using Sanger sequencing. Molecular analysis of p.Glu367GlyfsTer17 was alsoperformed for proband âs parents but mutation was not identi ï¬ed, what con ï¬rmed de novo character of variant of ASXL3 gene. Conclusions: In the case of patients with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders, BRPS should be considered in thedifferential diagnosis.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorders or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorders (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorders without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families.

The main features of patients with an 8q21.11 deletion encompassing this gene are intellectualdisability, hypotonia, short stature, and a peculiar facial pheno type. Corneal opacity has been frequently reported and some of the subjects also show a wide range of severe eye abnormalities. Case report: We describe a female patient with mild intellectualdisability and autism spectrum disorder. She had brachycephaly with ï¬at occiput, wide forehead, strabismus, monolateral ptosis, epicanthic folds, low set, prominent, posteriorly rotated ears, longand smooth philtrum, thin lips, high arched palate, microretrog nathia, short 4 thand 5thmetacarpal bones, lumbar hyperlordosis. Clinical Exome Sequencing revealed the presence of the hetero zygous de novo pathogenic variant c.3093 +1G>T in the ZFHX4 gene. This variant is located in a canonical donor splice site,suggesting a possible alteration of the splicing process and a loss of protein function. Conclusions: Severe eye abnormalities occur with a high frequency in patients with large 8q21.11 deletions. They range from Peters anomaly to cataract, microphthalmia, sclerocornea, corneal opacity, pigmentary retina degeneration. None of theseabnormalities have been reported in patients with ZFHX4 point mutations, intragenic deletions, or small deletions encompassing only ZFHX4 .

Introduction: Pakistan has one of the highest rates of con sanguinity worldwide. Our previous studies in this population demonstrate an exceptionally high prevalence (30 49%) ofmonogenic obesity in children, mainly due to homozygousmutations in LEP and LEPR genes. Here, for the ï¬rst time, we assess rare variants (MAF < 0.001 in gnomAD) in obesity associated genes in adults with severe obesity from the same region. Methods: Genomic DNA from randomly selected 128 subjects (BMI,37.7 Â± 0.5; Age ,18.7 Â± 0.3) was screened by conventional or augmented whole exome analysis. Results: We identi ï¬ed thirteen subjects carrying 13 variants in 7 monogenic obesity genes ( LEPR ,PCSK1 ,MC4R ,NTRK2 ,POMC, SH2B1 and SIM1) of which 4 predicted (likely) pathogenic through ACMG criteria. We further identi ï¬ed a novel homozygous stop gain mutation in ASNSD1 gene, inactivation of which in mouse results in obesity. Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 10 homozygous mutations in genes previously linked to obesity associated traits through GWAS. Finally, analyses of CNVs resulted in identi ï¬cation of 4 copy loss variants. Conclusions: Of signi ï¬cance is the identi ï¬cation of novel/rare variations in genes linked to obesity by GWAS and mouse knock outs providing mechanistic leads to genetic identi ï¬cation of severe obesity in human. Whereas in this adult cohort variants in genes involved in the downstream leptin signalling appear to be more prevalent, inactivating mutations in genes encoding keyregulators of leptin melanocortin pathway are absent ( LEP)o r under represented ( LEPR ). This is presumably due to high pathogenicity and mortality risk, and social disadvantage, in children with LEP or LEPR de ï¬ciency.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes.

Yet different cell types in the body are able to develop because epigenetic marks, placed on top of the DNA, direct each cell type to read only speci ï¬c sections of the DNA. There are several types of epigenetic marks includingDNA methylation (DNAm), and histone modi ï¬cations. These marks orchestrate normal developmental processes via the expression of several hundred epigenes (genes that function in epigeneticregulation). Rapid advances in genomic research have led to the identi ï¬cation of over 60 epigenes which are associated with Mendelian disorders, many of which are characterized byovergrowth and dysregulation of neurodevelopment. We andothers have identi ï¬ed highly speci ï¬c and highly sensitive genome wide DNAm signatures for several of these epigenes including DNMT3A, NSD1, EZH2/EED, and CHD8; mutations inthese genes are associated with Tatton Brown Rahman, Sotos,Weaver, and Autism syndromes, respectively.

During development, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are born in the nasal placode and migrate to the hypothalamus, where they position to regulate sexual reproduc tion. Defective GnRH neuron development may lead to GnRH deï¬ciency (GD) which is characterized by absent or delayed puberty.

Parkinson âs disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and the fastest growing neurological disease,with a prevalence in the general population aged â¥65 years of 2 3 % already. With no approved curative or disease modifying therapies currently available, PD presents a major unmet clinical need. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the abnormal aggrega tion of the protein Î± synuclein, encoded by the SNCA gene, is the causative agent of PD, driving the neuronal death and cellular dysfunction characteristic of the disorder. Given that multiplications of the SNCA gene are known to cause familial PD, and that PD risk loci identi ï¬ed through genome wide association studies have been shown to regulate SNCA expression, there has been growing interest in novel therapies directly targeting Î± synuclein. Here, we use novel antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeted to human SNCA to reduce Î± synuclein expression in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons generated from PD patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrate that an ASO induced reduction in Î± synuclein expression reverses established Î± synuclein pathology and rescues cell death in these neurons. We further demonstrate that this improvement in neuronal health may be mediated through an amelioration of mitochondrial function. In summary, our datasupports the continued exploration of ASO technology targeted to SNCA as a novel disease modifying therapy for PD and other related synucleinopathies.",2021.0,,J.R. Evans: None.
