410,728,The association analysis of ABHD11 gene (rs2293484 and rs10279013 with autism in a South African population.,P06.05,,"Background : Autism is genetically inherited neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant impairments of social interaction, difficulties in communication and displays of restrictive or repetitive behaviors activi ties and interests. Genome scan data have pointed towards the long arm of chromosome 7 as a strong candidate region. Various association and linkage studies are being undertaken in order to screen candidate genes mapping to the long arm of chromosome 7 as susceptibility loci. The anhydrolase do   main containing 11 gene (ABHD11) is located on 7q11.23 which is a hotspot region for autism. This gene has not been investigated for its association to autism. Aims : The aim of this study was to investigate the association of two SNPs from genes ABHD11 (rs2293484 and rs10279013) in South African autistic population.Methods : A total of 435 individuals were recruited in cluding 217 autistic and 218 control subjects. The Taqman Â®Real Time PCR and geno typing assay was utilized to determine the genotypes. Results: A significant association of SNP rs10279013 but not for SNP rs229348 with autism in the South African (SA) population is observed. Conclusion: There might be a possible role of ABHD11 in autism especially for SA populations.

239,948,common variants in cadherin 10 gene show  association with autism spectrum disorders in Finnish  population,P09.022,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are severe neurodevelopmental  disorders that are highly heritable, but phenotypic and genetic het   erogeneity have made it challenging to identify predisposing variants  across populations. Although 10 20% of ASD cases are known to be  caused by rare high penetrance mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities,  and de novo DNA copy number variation, genome wide association  studies (GWAS) with large sample sizes have also revealed common  genetic variants associated with ASDs. Recently, several candidate  genes have been shown in independent studies to be associated with  ASDs in different populations. To test for association between ASDs  and genetic variants in these genes in the Finnish founder popula   tion, we have genotyped 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in eight candidate genes in families with autism (n,142) or Asperger  syndrome (AS; n,121) and performed association analyses. In the au   tism study sample, the most significant association was observed with  an intronic SNP in CDH10 , rs1505874 ( P,0.000066). In the AS study  sample, the most significant association was also observed in CDH10,  but with intronic rs6867043 ( P,0.000774). In a recent GWAS (Wang  et al.  2009), signals with a strong genome wide significance were ob   served in six SNPs located between CDH10  and CDH9 . Results from  our study support the role of CDH10  in ASDs using an independent  sample. To our knowledge, this is the first replicated association be   tween ASDs and CDH10  reported.

383,614,Custom designed CGH array in autism spectrum disorders,P05.030,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a complex multifac torial etilogy. Recently, copy number variants (CNVâs) have been shown to contribute to over 10% of ASD cases. Many of the known genes whose mutations cause ASD, have functions related to epigenetic regulation. We have applied a custom designed oligo array CGH with an exonic overlapping coverage of 450 genes known to cause autism or intellectual disability and autism candidate genes related to epigenetic machinery.Material and methods: Custom oligonucleotide arrays (formats 4x44 and 8x60) were designed with e Array Agilent technology. The final array design contains: 36,000 exonic probes for 450 genes considered of high priority (mean distance between probes 25bp), 2,000 probes for regulatory ele ments and microRNAâs and 22,000 whole genome probes (backbone).Results: We have studied a series of 139 patients including syndromic au   tism and/or familial cases of idiopathic autism.

524,2409, Epidemiology of consanguineous families in Autism,J17.71,,"Analyses of large autism datasets have provided statistical and functio nal evidence for the role of rare point mutations (OÃ¢ÂÂRoak, 2012, Sanders, 2012; Yu, 2013) and transmitted and de novo copy number variants (CNVs)(Morrow, 2008; Pinto, 2010; Levy, 2011; Sanders, 2011), and offer crucial insights into the diverse genetic mechanisms that can lead to Autism Spec trum Disorders (ASDs). Here we present CNV analysis for a cohort of 183 consanguineous families with one or more children affected with ASD. We provide new insights into the genetic architecture of ASDs as our cohort is uniquely enriched for recessive loss of function variants. We follow up fin dings and draw comparisons with additional large ASD and control data   sets: the Simons Simplex and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collections (2,670 affected individuals; 9681 total individuals). Comparing across these cohorts, we demonstrate that ascertainment can lead to selec tion of different underlying genetic mechanisms causing ASDs. These diffe rences are reflected in metrics such as the affected male:female ratio and the relative contribution of de novo CNVs versus inherited homozygous de   letions. Specifically, we find that de novo CNVs play a significant role in non consanguineous families with a single affected child (p,0.04), but a lesser role in multiplex families, and they are no more common in ASD cases than  controls in multiplex consanguineous families.

Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients  and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population.Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func  tional GTF2IRD2  genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls.  We also identified a disruptive mutation (p.M1?) in a GTF2IRD2  copy in two  affected brothers, inherited from their father. In the chr9 pericentromeric region, a de novo deletion was identified in a patient but the global distribu  tion of rearrangements and rare SNVs did not differ significantly between controls and patients.Conclusions: Despite their complex genetic architecture, our method suc cessfully identifies rearrangements and SNVs in SDs, such as copy gains and mutations at GTF2IRD2 or deletions of CNTNAP3 that could represent sus  ceptibility factors for ASD.Grant support: FISPI1302481/PI1300823/FEDER, 2014SGR1468 and FI DGR/2013.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  182Back to index",2016,,"M.

Epidemiological evidence from family and twin studies supports a strong genetic component in ASD etiology. Oxidative stress and abnormal DNA me thylation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. Brain tissues from ASD cases showed higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers than healthy controls in postmortem analysis. Association between oxidative stress and DNA damage has been well known. Thus, we sought to investiga te a potential link between DNA repair genes and ASD and analyze the role of XPD Asp312Asn and XRCC4 G 1394T gene polymorphisms for ASD in the Turkish population.Material and Methods: Genotyping was conducted by PCR RFLP based on 100 patients and 96 unrelated healthy controls.Results: We, for the first time, demonstrated a positive association between XRCC4 gene variants and ASD risk. Frequencies of XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotypes were higher in patients (%34) than the controls (%18.7). The statistical analysis revealed that the individuals who had XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotype had an increased risk for ASD (OR , 2.23, 95% CI , 1.10 4.55).

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi  duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%). CYP2D6 metabo  lizes most psychoactive drugs, while CYP1A1 acts on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of endocrine disrupting chemi cals (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A).

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER. This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore. To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com  pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases. The subject âs transcriptome showed increased expression (>5sd) of genes including the ATP2A3 calcium pump and purinergic receptors, and extremely lowexpression (>24sd) of VDAC2, a mitochondrial calcium uptake channel.

Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study. The  study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German). Twenty eight tagSNPs were selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. A significant association, that over   came the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and permutations was obtained with the marker rs7052177 (p, 6.13e 4). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible participation of PTCHD1 rare variants in ASD and  ID, we are currently performing a mutation screening in the Spanish ASD cohort, and in an additional sample of 200 individuals with ID.

While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver  Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis   order 1 were identified. Conclusion: The preliminary results show that deep phenotyping provided  by a computer aided facial analysis could be instrumental in the early clini cal diagnostic of the syndromic ASD forms and could help in the selection of diagnostic molecular tests.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that  there is an enrichment in CNVs encompassing synaptic transmission genes in ASD.To obtain a list of genes involved in synaptic structure and function, we que ry pathway databases for synaptic pathways (KEGG and GO). By intersecting this list with the results of a large CNV genomic screening in ASD patients (performed by the Autism Genome Project), and CNV information on the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), we found a significantly increased bur den of CNVs encompassing synaptic genes in ASD subjects compared to DGV controls (Fisher exact test P,2.2X10  16, OR,1.47). Detailed analysis of the frequencies of each synaptic gene duplicated or de   leted by CNVs in ASD and control subjects identified 39 genes that were si gnificantly more frequent in ASD (P<0.05).

The nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway is essential to control mRNA quality and has an important role in the regulation of thetranscriptome. Mutations in genes involved in the NMD pathway, such as the UPF3B gene, a core component of this pathway, were previously linked to ASD. In this study weexplored the potential role of other NMD factors in ASD. We generated a list of 153 genes involved in the NMD pathway using AmiGO, Reactome and a systematic litera ture review. To identify potentially pathogenic variants in the NMD genes, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data (WES) data from 1338 ASD subjects. We also searched forCopy Number Variants (CNVs) targeting NMD genes in ASD patients (n ,3570) and checked their frequency in controls (n ,9649).

620,741,Contribution of chromosomal aberrations in mosaicism to Autism Spectrum Disorders,P09.017,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequent  neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD has a strong genetic component in its  etiology, including de novo germ line mutations and copy number variants.  Detectable mosaicism for chromosomal rearrangements in blood has been reported in >1% of the aging population (>65y), but is very rare in young  people. Chromosomal mosaicism due to early developmental events could  be causative of ASD.Methods: We have studied molecular karyotypes (SNP array) of blood DNA of two large ASD datasets, the Autism Genome Project and the Simons Sim  plex Collection (4427 patients, 9268 parents, 2433 unaffected siblings) for  mosaic chromosomal alterations >0.4Mb, using the MAD and Tripod soft wares. As age matched controls, we also used reported data of 5094 child  ren with no developmental abnormalities. We independently analyzed data  from cell line DNA of 564 patients and 806 parents.Results: Mosaic alterations (0.4 155Mb) were detected in blood DNA of  21 out of 4427 patients (0,47%). A total of 34 events were also detected  in parental samples (0,37%) and 5/7517 unaffected children (0,07%). The frequency of detectable mosaicism is significantly higher in ASD patients. In cell line DNA, the frequency was similar in cases and parents although 6 unbalanced chromosomal translocations were detected in patients and just 1 in parents.Conclusion: Chromosomal aberrations present in mosaicism are detected in blood samples of a small but significant proportion of children with ASD (0,47%).

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi  duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%).

527,134, Whole genome sequencing reveals the mutation characteristics in Autism Spectrum Disorder,C10.1,,"JohnÃ¢ÂÂs, NL, Canada. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous, with evi  dence for hundreds of susceptibility loci. Previous microarray and exome  sequencing studies have examined portions of the genome in simplex fami  lies (parents and one ASD affected child) having presumed sporadic forms of the disorder. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 85 quartet  families (parents and two ASD affected siblings), consisting of 170 indivi  duals with ASD, to generate a comprehensive data resource encompassing all classes of genetic variation (including noncoding variants) and accom panying phenotypes, in apparently familial forms of ASD. By examining de  novo and rare inherited single nucleotide and structural variations in genes  previously reported to be associated with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders, we found that more than two thirds of the affected siblings car  ried different ASD relevant mutations. These siblings with discordant muta   tions tended to demonstrate more clinical variability than those who shared  a risk variant. Our study emphasizes that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in ASD, necessitating the use of WGS to delineate all genic and non genic susceptibility variants in research and in clinical diagnostics.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental condi   tion with highly complex genetic predisposition. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of both sequence and structural rare variations in ASD susceptibility. In particular, focusing on rare copy number variants (CNVs) has already been highly productive in uncovering an increasing num ber of specific genes and chromosomal intervals conferring risk to ASD.During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach on 9 multiplex ASD families from Sardinia, we identified a rare genic deletion of ~37 Kb, transmitted from the unaffected mother to both affected siblings. This deletion includes the entire CAPG gene and the last coding exons of  ELMOD3 . CAPG encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin re  gulatory proteins, that might be involved in control of dendritic spine shape. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, with recently proposed functional links to sound perception and actin cytoske leton.No deletions involving this genomic region were found in 4768 controls from published high resolution SNP array data, while other two deletions encompassing CAPG and ELMOD3 have been reported in two subjects with  ASD, suggesting that CAPG and/or ELMOD3 haploinsufficiency may have  clinical relevance to ASD. In order to test this hypothesis together with a recessive model of inheritance, we first excluded that this deletion is a com mon polymorphism in Sardinia, then we performed expression and muta   tion analysis of both genes in the discovery pedigree, and a further clinical evaluation of all family members.Grant references: Fondazione Banco di Sardegna, Kyulan Family Foundati o",2015,,"E.

345,960," Mirror effects for Autism Spectrum Disorder due to gene dosage at 10q11.22 affecting GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth and PPYR1 gene involved in energy homeostasis.",P09.030,,", Madrid, Spain. We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including  GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome. Specifi   cally, duplications were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of speech, and lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features. Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant. We concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients. We now report more convincing evidences that dosage balance at GPRIN2 locus plays a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We observed 6 pati   ents affected by ASD with an overlapping small deletion including the two genes (and extending to MAPK8 in one patient). We then compared a group of 164 ASD patients with a group of 180 syndromic and non syndromic intel lectual deficit (SID/NSID) patients and 160 controls.

Two maternal uncles are healthy.In both patients, array CGH analysis revealed a 250 kb deletion of chromosome 7q31.32 encompassing one single gene, CADPS2. The father does not carry the deletion, indicating likely maternal inheritance. The deletion was excluded in one of the maternal uncles.CADPS2 is a calcium binding protein that regulates the exocytosis of synaptic and dense core vesicles in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. CADPS2 is a candidate gene for autistic disorders, since it maps in the  autism susceptibility region AUTS1 on chromosome 7q31.32, which alsocorresponds to a candidate region for mood disorders. Knock out mice show an autistic like phenotype and some ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) patients show a possible defect in CADPS2 splicing. We performed, therefore, a mutation screening in 46 individuals with ASD and in 34 patients with intellectual disability who did not carry any genomic rearrangement as far as array CGH analysis could detect. Two novel variants were identified in two unrelated ASD individuals, in exon 6 and exon 13 respectively. None of these changes was detected in 140 healthy individuals and functional analysis of these variants is currently ongoing. Detailed results will be presented.",2011,,"G. Tortora1, C. Graziano1, S.

In a genome wide CNVs screening performed by the AGP , a rare inherited  microdeletion, disrupting two genes transcribed in the same direction,  KLHL23 and SSB, was identified in an Italian ASD individual. This deletion, potentially resulting in a gene fusion transcript, causes a frameshift with the  introduction of a premature stop codon. No fusion transcript was detected  by RT PCR, suggesting that it is subject to ânonsense mediated mRNA decayâ. KLHL23 encodes for a brain expressed Kelch repeat protein of unknown function. While several CNVs affecting SSB are reported in controls making  it an unikely dosege sensitive gene, no CNVs have been previously described  in KLHL23. KLHL23 expression analysis in peripheral blood of the CNV car riers did not show reduction of RNA levels, although we canât exclude that  the deletion could have an effect on the brain. In a mutation screening of KLHL23 in 85 multiplex familis with ASD we identified a damaging variant (M65V), absent in controls, and segregating  with the ASD in an affected sibling pair.

Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription.

We show for the first time that mutations of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor cause different and specific epilepsy phenotypes. NR2 muta   tions are involved in benign Rolandic epilepsy, the most frequent childhood epilepsy as well as in a variety of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathi es, such as Landau Kleffner and West syndrome. Furthermore, we demon   strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign  Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre  sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations.

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families. The identi ï¬ed biallelic damaging variants could affect the CACNA1H protein activity with a recessive model and contribute to the disease development in the context of a high risk genetic background. Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.Supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Grant GR 2013 02357561).",2021,,M.

Its genetic underpinnings are very heteroge neous and include many common and rare variants located in hundreds of different loci, each characterized by variable levels of penetrance. Multiplex families from single ethnic groups represent a useful means to reduce hete rogeneity and enhance genetic load. We screened 19 Italian ASD multiplex families (3 triplets and 16 duplets, total N,41 ASD subjects), using array CGH (Agilent 180K). Certainly or probably causal CNVs, defined Ã¢ÂÂclinical   ly relevant CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ, were detected in 17/41 (41%) of ASD probands, corre sponding to 9/19 (47%) multiplex families with at least one affected sibling genetically positive. However only in 3/9 (33%) of these families, siblings share the same causal or highly causal CNV. Additional potentially relevant CNVs not shared by affected sib pairs were detected also in these three fa milies. 45 genes are located on the Ã¢ÂÂclinically relevantÃ¢ÂÂ CNVs. Through an enrichment analysis, we found that 9/45 (20%) of these genes appear pri marily involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation/management. Our results highlight the importance of synaptic and neurite elongation ge nes in the pathogenesis of autism, despite genetic heterogeneity in ASD even within multiplex families belonging to a single ethnic group.

Recently, array based genome wide screens have demonstrated frequent copy number variation in non syndromic ASD .  Screening 56 patients with autism and additional major or minor anom   alies with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP platform (Illumina, Inc.,  San Diego, CA) we found in 16 patients 9 regions with deleted and 9 with duplicated signals . Aberrant signals were distributed among 16 distinct chromosomal loci . Apart from 14 patients with unique aberra   tions, 2 patients carried duplications and a 3rd patient a deletion within  the 22q11 region, of 0 .726, 2 .966, and 0 .388 Mb, respectively  . The  duplications were confirmed by multiplex ligation mediated probe am   plification and are likely to involve LCRs A, B and D. We conclude that  SNP array based screening of ASD patients uncovers an appreciable  number of CNVs, which in part overlap with loci already discovered by  other approaches. Our finding that 3 out of 56 ASD patients carried aberrations within the 22q11 region is highly unexpected .

240,959,Systematic evaluation of the clinical significance of  inherited and de novo copy Number Variations in families with  Autism spectrum Disorders,P09.033,,"Array based studies have detected a wealth of copy number variations  (CNVs) in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Since some  CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini   cal significance of de novo  and inherited CNVs containing genes being  transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive   ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were  grouped into four categories. First, de novo  CNVs in families with both  parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from  a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely  to be causally related to ASD. The genes in these two categories par   ticipate in pathways probably associated with ASD, such as contactin  based cell communication ( CNTN5 , CNTN6 ), phosphoinositol signaling  (PIK3CA ), and regulation of neurotransmitter levels ( KCNMB4 , TPH2 ).  The de novo  CNVs found in patients with at least one parent scoring  higher than 1 SD above the mean on the SRS, and the CNVs inher   ited from an unaffected parent, while the other parent has an elevated  SRS score, are likely to exert a minor contribution to the phenotype.  Our analysis also indicates that in 6 out of 48 ASD patients two or more  genetic etiologies may be involved. This study extends the scope of  genome wide CNV profiling beyond de novo  CNVs in sporadic patients,  and may constitute a first step toward uncovering the missing heritability  in genome wide screening studies of complex psychiatric disorders .Complex traits and polygenic disorders22",2010,,"M.

We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including  GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome. Specifi   cally, duplications were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of speech, and lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features. Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant. We concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients. We now report more convincing evidences that dosage balance at GPRIN2 locus plays a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autistic spectrum. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndromes in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval.Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan   ces. We selected a large and unique panel of WBS and 7dup ASD patients and derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the most advanced reprogramming technology based on synthetic mRNAs. These were then differentiated into relevant lineages to establish experimentally tractable models of these conditions.

620,741,Contribution of chromosomal aberrations in mosaicism to Autism Spectrum Disorders,P09.017,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequent  neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD has a strong genetic component in its  etiology, including de novo germ line mutations and copy number variants.  Detectable mosaicism for chromosomal rearrangements in blood has been reported in >1% of the aging population (>65y), but is very rare in young  people. Chromosomal mosaicism due to early developmental events could  be causative of ASD.Methods: We have studied molecular karyotypes (SNP array) of blood DNA of two large ASD datasets, the Autism Genome Project and the Simons Sim  plex Collection (4427 patients, 9268 parents, 2433 unaffected siblings) for  mosaic chromosomal alterations >0.4Mb, using the MAD and Tripod soft wares. As age matched controls, we also used reported data of 5094 child  ren with no developmental abnormalities. We independently analyzed data  from cell line DNA of 564 patients and 806 parents.Results: Mosaic alterations (0.4 155Mb) were detected in blood DNA of  21 out of 4427 patients (0,47%). A total of 34 events were also detected  in parental samples (0,37%) and 5/7517 unaffected children (0,07%). The frequency of detectable mosaicism is significantly higher in ASD patients. In cell line DNA, the frequency was similar in cases and parents although 6 unbalanced chromosomal translocations were detected in patients and just 1 in parents.Conclusion: Chromosomal aberrations present in mosaicism are detected in blood samples of a small but significant proportion of children with ASD (0,47%).

Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients  and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population.Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func  tional GTF2IRD2  genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls.  We also identified a disruptive mutation (p.M1?) in a GTF2IRD2  copy in two  affected brothers, inherited from their father. In the chr9 pericentromeric region, a de novo deletion was identified in a patient but the global distribu  tion of rearrangements and rare SNVs did not differ significantly between controls and patients.Conclusions: Despite their complex genetic architecture, our method suc cessfully identifies rearrangements and SNVs in SDs, such as copy gains and mutations at GTF2IRD2 or deletions of CNTNAP3 that could represent sus  ceptibility factors for ASD.Grant support: FISPI1302481/PI1300823/FEDER, 2014SGR1468 and FI DGR/2013.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  182Back to index",2016,,"M.

673,1902, Genetics of language deficits in schizophrenia and autism: an evolutionary approach,P09.38,,"Both autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are highly prevalent cognitive disorders, entailing language deficits. Recent advances in genome wide technologies have provided with a long list of candidate genes for SZ and ASD, but the gap between genes, the pathophysiology of SZ and ASD, and their distinctive cognitive and linguistic profiles still remains open. Our study aims to bridge this gap through an evo devo approach that focuses on how language evolved in the species and that construes both con ditions as poles of a continuum of modes of cognition, also encompassing typically developing cognition. To this aim, we have performed literature mining and network analysis of known candidate genes for SZ and ASD and found that they are overrepresented among the gene believed to be impor   tant for the evolution of the human faculty of language. Many of these genes are common risk factors for both conditions. Additionally, we performed in silico data mining of previously published SZ and ASD microarray data   sets and found that many of these genes important for language evolution (like CNTNAP2, DLX5, FOXP1, or ROBO2) are differentially expressed in the brains of schizophrenics and autists. We will conclude that the (substanti   ally opposite) linguistic (dys)abilities seen in SZ and ASD patients may re present abnormal (but still related) ontogenetic itineraries for the human faculty of language and that the same factors that prompted the transition from an ape like cognition to a human specific cognition may explain the high prevalence of SZ and ASD, but also their related cognitive profiles.Grant: FFI2014 61888 EXP E",2016,,"A.

Incomplete penetrance of theaffected genes and variable expressivity usually is indicated as cause of clinical features. Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities.Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro  mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs.

Materials and Methods: In the context of an Interna  tional project aiming at identifying the genetic causes of ASD (Autism Sequencing Consortium, Mount Sinai), weperformed a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis in a cohort of 100 ASD patients, not harboring CNVs, attending the Medical Genetics Unit of Siena. Results: Mutations in already known ASD related genes were detected in 11% of cases, while either de novo or inherited mutations in novel genes were identi ï¬ed in 21% of cases. The novel identi ï¬ed genes can be pooled in three categories: i genes for which causative mutations have not1378been previously reported (eight genes), ii genes for which a likely association with ASD has been previously reported in a single case (eg DRP2 etc) and iii genes whose mutations have been previously associated with intellectual disability (ID) in only one (eg BCORL1 etc) or a few families (eg BRD4 recently associated with a Cornelia De Lange likephenotype etc). Conclusions: Overall, our extensive approach goes beyond safely con ï¬rming the pathogenic role of ASD/ID candidate genes and allows establishing the novel role of ID related genes in ASD.

The nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway is essential to control mRNA quality and has an important role in the regulation of thetranscriptome. Mutations in genes involved in the NMD pathway, such as the UPF3B gene, a core component of this pathway, were previously linked to ASD. In this study weexplored the potential role of other NMD factors in ASD. We generated a list of 153 genes involved in the NMD pathway using AmiGO, Reactome and a systematic litera ture review. To identify potentially pathogenic variants in the NMD genes, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data (WES) data from 1338 ASD subjects. We also searched forCopy Number Variants (CNVs) targeting NMD genes in ASD patients (n ,3570) and checked their frequency in controls (n ,9649). We identi ï¬ed 43 high impact variants in 28 NMD genes, including the UPF3B and ACE, two genes previously implicated in ASD. Importantly, 11 were novel candidategenes that carry loss of function and missense (deleterious and damaging) variants with a frequency of 1 to 5% in this ASD dataset.

771,458,A Establishing genotype phenotype associations for ASD,P09.026,,"Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) has hindered the establishment of genotype phenotype associations. Herein, we presented a novel approach that integrates semantic similarity andunsupervised machine learning methods to dissect the ASD genotypic heterogeneity and to identify phenotypic mani  festations of ASD genetic variants. This approach wasapplied to copy number variants (N ,6650), disrupting 3998 genes from 1119 ASD patients. Functional similarities among genes were computed using Resnik semanticsimilarity measure. Semantic similarity score, ranging from 0 to 1 represents the functional similarity between two genes, where 1 represents identical genes while score 0reï¬ects functionally dissimilar genes. Agglomerative hier  archical clustering of the computed gene similarity matrix identi ï¬ed four different clusters of functionally related genes. Silhouette analysis indicated that clusters were compact and consistent (average Silhouette value ,0.31). The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD. Cluster 1 genes were also most signiï¬cantly enriched for Schizophrenia Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term, which is a co occurring condition with ASD. The other three clusters were not enriched for ASD related HPO terms. The results indicated thatphenotypic genotypic associations can established for ASD by reducing its genotypic heterogeneity i.e. clustering of functionally similar genes. However, to associate theseclusters with phenotype, further efforts are required to enrich HPO resource. (Grant reference: PTDC/CCI BIO/ 28685/2017) A.C.G. IlhÃ©u: None. M. Asif: None. F.M.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components.

Methods: We included 147 patients with an unrepaired ASD. We curated a list of ASD candidate genes, and patients wereanalyzed for genetic variants in these genes, using targeted next generation sequencing. We ï¬ltered for protein altering variants (PAVs) with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01 and predictedpathogenicity using the Combined Annotation Dependent Deple tion (CADD) method. The number of rare and pathogenic variants in cases were compared with variants identi ï¬ed in 33,370 controls of European ancestry. Results: We identi ï¬ed 384 rare (MAF < 0.01) PAVs in 59 genes. ASD patients were signi ï¬cantly enriched for very rare (MAF < 0.0001) PAVs compared to controls (P ,0.0001). The frequency of PAVs with CADD score â¥30 was signi ï¬cantly higher in ASD patients, compared to controls (P ,0.0042). Conclusions: Patients with a small, unrepaired ASD were enriched for rare PAVs within 59 ASD candidate disease genes. Our resultssuggest that recurrence risk may be increased for this group ofpatients and warrants further inve stigations. Funding: This work was supported by Novo Nordic Foundation (Grant no.

481,780, S Genetic evidence that hyperactive Th2 and NK immune pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder,P09.023,,"Converging evidence suggests that abnormal immunity is involved in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) both in children and  adults. Altered immune processes include ongoing neuroinflammation in  post mortem brains, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal  fluid and blood, altered immune cell function, presence of brain specific  auto antibodies, and dysregulated immune transcriptome. One strategy to  assess whether dysimmunity contributes to ASD pathogenesis or represents  a collateral by standing effect is to investigate whether functional SNPs  known to influence immune gene expression or function are associated with  ASD. We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro  band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in  all major immune pathways. Statistically significant opposite transmission  patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression  and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite  alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi  nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG)  activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autistic disorder in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014,,"I.

591,141,A Complex Mutational Spectrum of Structural Variation Contributing to Autism,C15.1,,"Recent genomic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have relied upon genome wide characterization of coding mutations using whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variants (CNV) using chromosomal microarray (CMA). In ASD, these efforts have revealed a strong associati on with de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and CNVs segments that alter the dosage of genes under evolutionary constraint. Unfortunately, the impact of balanced and complex structural variation (SV), which also repre sent LoF variation, remains uncharacterized in ASD and other human disea   se studies. Here, we explored the full mutational spectrum of SV contribu ting to ASD by integrating large insert, short insert and synthetic long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies with CMA in 307 idiopathic ASD probands and 120 family members from the Simons Simplex Collec tion. Analyses revealed a diverse landscape of SVs beyond canonical CNVs, including inversions, insertions, and translocations. We also categorized 13 distinct subclasses of recurrent complex SVs and demonstrate that each ge nome sequenced harbored at least one such large complex rearrangement (~5 kb resolution). We identified 26 de novo SVs likely contributing to ASD, 50% of which were cryptic to detection by previous technologies on the se same samples. These data confirmed 13 previously proposed ASD risk factors and discovered 12 novel candidates. We estimate that the overall contribution of de novo SVs in ASD at this resolution to be at least 8.2%, or a two fold increase over previous analyses restricted to CNVs. These data suggest that cryptic and complex SV represent an important and presently underappreciated component of ASD etiology.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ï¬rst benchmarked our bioinfor  matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conï¬rmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub  stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ï¬rst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B.B.

630,753, Increased frequency of the autism broader phenotype in mothers transmitting etiological CNVs to sons affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),P09.029,,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder with a high male to female ratio. An increased prevalence of autism like perso   nality traits is found in unaffected relatives of ASD children, suggesting a genetic liability of a broader autism phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that the parents of ASD children who transmit etiological CNVs might exhi bit ASD traits more frequently than non transmitting parents. To test this hypothesis, we analysed CNV inheritance and parental behavioral traits in families from the Autism Genome Project, assessed using the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) (N,341) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (N,456). We selected CNVs spanning well established candidate genes for ASD, and compared transmitting and non transmitting parental test scores using a t test corrected for multiple testing by the Group Benja   mini Hochberg Procedure. Overall, CNV transmitting parents did not differ significantly in BAPQ and  SRS scores from non transmitting parents. However, independent analyses of relative pairs revealed a significant difference in BAPQ global (t, 2.18; ad  justed P,.032), BAPQ aloofness domain (t, 2.61; adjusted P,.032) and SRS  scores (t, 2.03; adjusted P,.047) between mothers transmitting and mo thers not transmitting etiological CNVs to their affected sons. Our findings  indicate that mothers presenting personality traits in the broader autism  phenotype are frequently carriers of pathogenic CNVs that they transmit to their ASD sons. The results from the analyses of maternal phenotype and CNV transmission patterns to sons support previous reports of maternal  transmission bias to male offspring, and the prevalent hypothesis of a high  er genetic risk tolerance in females due to putative protective factors.

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi  duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%).

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER.

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families. The identi ï¬ed biallelic damaging variants could affect the CACNA1H protein activity with a recessive model and contribute to the disease development in the context of a high risk genetic background. Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.Supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Grant GR 2013 02357561).",2021,,M.

420,738,Homozygous exonic deletion in CTNNA3 suggests a role for alfaT catenin in susceptibility to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs),P06.18,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable, neurodevelopmen tal conditions, showing extreme genetic heterogeneity. While it is well esta blished that de novo genetic variation plays an important role in ASD risk, recent studies have demonstrated a convincing evidence of a rare recessive contribution to the heritability of ASDs.In the genome wide CNV study carried out by the Autism Genetic Consorti   um (AGP), we identified one homozygous deletion intersecting the CTNNA3 gene in an Italian proband with ASD and moderate intellectual disability (PIQ,50). This deletion includes a coding exon, leading to a putative frames hift and premature stop codon, inherited from both parents, each heterozy   gote for a deletion of slightly different length. The unaffected sister is also heterozygote for the deletion.CTNNA3 encodes for the alfaT catenin protein that has a crucial role in cel lular adherence showing suggestive association in GWAS and a de novo de   letion.Even if the frequency of exonic deletions of CTNNA3 is not significantly dif   ferent between ASDs cases and controls (17/2446 cases and 35/5097 con trols, P,.88), no homozygous exonic deletions were found in a sample of  5097 controls, suggesting that only the complete knockout of CTNNA3 could  cause or confer susceptibility for ASDs. Expression analysis of alfaT catenin and alfaN catenin proteins in mouse cortex and hippocampus (P0 P90), provided further support of a role of CTNNA3 in early mid fetal develop  ment of the brain. While the exact biological significance of CTNNA3 homozygous deletion is yet to be determined, we hypothesize that it could have clinical relevance to  the ASDs phenotype in this Italian patient.  E.

Chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) has offered a high detection rate of small and large CNVs associated with ASD, and ledto discovery of new autism genes. We report on the results of chromosomal CMA investigation in a group of ASDs patients. Eighty patients were referred to our laboratory forgenetic testing with ASDs as part of a broad phenotype including ID or other clinical features. A complete clinical evaluation was performed with focus on psychiatric exam ination and psychological evaluation with speci ï¬c ASDs tests (ADOS, ADI R). Array CGH completed with kar  yotyping, FISH and qPCR tests were performed. A total of21 pathological CNVs (14 deletions and 7 duplications), with a median length of 3.7 Mb were detected in 17 patients. The involved genomic regions overlap 550 OMIMgenes. Besides well described syndromic regions associated with ASDs (e.g. deletions of 1q21.1, 22q13.3, 22q11.2, MBD5; Xq28 duplication), other genomic regions, rarelyreported in patients with ASDs were identi ï¬ed (deletion of 8p11.2p21.2, 9q34.1, 9p13, duplication of 7p22.2p22.1 , CHRNA7) ; thus having the potential to reveal new ASD genes.

239,948,common variants in cadherin 10 gene show  association with autism spectrum disorders in Finnish  population,P09.022,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are severe neurodevelopmental  disorders that are highly heritable, but phenotypic and genetic het   erogeneity have made it challenging to identify predisposing variants  across populations. Although 10 20% of ASD cases are known to be  caused by rare high penetrance mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities,  and de novo DNA copy number variation, genome wide association  studies (GWAS) with large sample sizes have also revealed common  genetic variants associated with ASDs. Recently, several candidate  genes have been shown in independent studies to be associated with  ASDs in different populations. To test for association between ASDs  and genetic variants in these genes in the Finnish founder popula   tion, we have genotyped 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in eight candidate genes in families with autism (n,142) or Asperger  syndrome (AS; n,121) and performed association analyses. In the au   tism study sample, the most significant association was observed with  an intronic SNP in CDH10 , rs1505874 ( P,0.000066). In the AS study  sample, the most significant association was also observed in CDH10,  but with intronic rs6867043 ( P,0.000774). In a recent GWAS (Wang  et al.  2009), signals with a strong genome wide significance were ob   served in six SNPs located between CDH10  and CDH9 . Results from  our study support the role of CDH10  in ASDs using an independent  sample. To our knowledge, this is the first replicated association be   tween ASDs and CDH10  reported. CDH10 is involved in neuronal cell  adhesion and in the development of synaptic complexes so our results  further support the hypothesis that neuronal cell adhesion are impli   cated in the etiology of ASDs.",2010,,"M.

Epilepsy occurs in 25% of patients with autism. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) and massively parallel sequencing have identified a large number of genomic regions as well as specific genes which confer suscep   tibility to autism. Six pathogenic copy number variants (4 deletions and 2 duplications) which ranged from 1.3  17.2 Mb and overlapping the HDAC1 gene had been reported. HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, directly interacts with MeCP2 through the transcription co repressor Sin3A/HDAC complex. Mutations in MECP2 cause Rett syndrome; however, no mutations have been described in HDAC1 so far. In a 10 year old boy with non syndromic autism, developmental delay and epilepsy, routine karyotype, CMA, meta bolic, and neuroimaging studies were normal.

133,440,Frequency of mosaic aneuploidy in children with  idiopathic autism,P0303.,,"It has been repeatedly suggested that numerous human diseases in   cluding major psychiatric disorders could be associated with mosaic  aneuploidy. Here, we have attempted to test this hypothesis concern   ing autism, a common childhood psychiatric disorder. About 5 10% of  autism cases are known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities  or gene mutations. However, mosaic aneuploidy in autism has not ever  been studied. We surveyed stochastic aneuploidy in children with/with   out idiopathic autism by interphase multiprobe fluorescence in situ hy   bridization (mFISH). The rate of chromosome loss and gain involving  six arbitrarily selected autosomes (chromosomes 1, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18)  and sex chromosomes was assessed in peripheral blood cells of 60  unaffected male children and 116 male children with idiopathic autism.  Studying over 420,000 cells, we have determined the mean frequency  of stochastic aneuploidy in control and autism: Control Chromosome loss Chromosome gain Autosomes   Sex chromosomes0.58% (95% CI 0.42 0.75%)   _0.15% (95% CI 0.09 0.21%)   1.11% (95% CI 0.90 1.31%) Autism Autosomes   Sex chromosomes0.60% (95% CI 0.37 0.83%)   _0.22% (95% CI 0.14 0.30%)   1.01% (95% CI 0.85 1.17%) CI   confidence interval The difference of stochastic aneuploidy rate was insignificant. However, the frequency  of mosaic aneuploidy over the background level was found in 19 (16%) of 116 children  with idiopathic autism, while outlier values were not found in controls. These data  identify mosaic aneuploidy as a new autism genetic risk factor. Therefore, molecular  cytogenetic analysis of somatic mosaicism is warranted in children with idiopathic au   tism.

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER.

The platform of choice to  detect genome wide CNVs has traditionally been microarray (including SNP  arrays that can also detect copy neutral LOH regions); however, since samp  les have often undergone sequencing to discover pathogenic sequence vari  ants, it is desirable to exploit these data to also detect CNVs.

Afterwards he tried to graduate from expert school for social sciences which could not be  completed because of his special defects in social competence and  communication skills, and his deficiency of empathy which, at the end  of the initiated diagnostic procedure, led to the diagnosis of Asperger  autism. Since recent studies (1) were able to show a defined interstitial dupli   cation of chromosome15q11 13 in a few patients with autism disorder  (1 3%) we investigated this region with respect to this abnormality . We were able to show a duplication of the region of interest with the  proof of three alleles for the internal markers D15S122, D15S822 and  D15S1234. Furthermore we could confirm this result with FISH using the probe  GABRB3 (15q11 12),which showed three signals on meta  and inter   phase chromosomes. Parental investigations (FISH and molecular analysis) were inconspic   uous. Microsatellite analysis showed that the duplication did arise from  the boy`s maternal chromosome 15, as described in the literature (2). The proposed mechanism is misalignment in maternal meiotic recom   bination. The influence of parental imprinting on phenotype will be discussed; the  variation of the symptoms of the yet published cases will be shown.",2007,,"Oehl Jaschkowitz1, T. Martin1, E. Goettert1, A.

The world  wide average prevalence of ASDs is 1 in 160 children and1 3% of ID. Due to the genetic heterogeneity of these pathologies different genetic tests are available. Today,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1439chromosomal microarray is the ï¬rst tier recommended diagnostic test and provides a yield around 10 15% for ID patients and around 9% for ASDs patients, depending on the cohort. Our goal is to evaluate if the diagnostic yield estimated by targeted sequencing in our cohorts of ID or ASDs subjects is higher than that obtained by CGH array.We screened 701 in house selected ID related genes and 189 autism related genes in a cohort of more than 100 and 60 patients, respectively. Libraries were prepared withdifferent capture kits and the Illumina NextSeq500 platform was used to sequence targeted regions. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with an in house pipeline. Thediagnostic yield was 41% in the ID cohort and 20% in the ASDs cohort. Variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 50% of the ID patients and 72% of the autism patients and negative results were obtained in 9% and 8% of the ID and autism individuals, respectively. ID or autism  related genes sequencing provide higher diagnostic yieldsthan CGH array. Furthermore, copy number variants evaluation could be performed simultaneously with our pipeline. For this reason, we proposed targeted sequencingas the ï¬rst tier genetic test for ID and autism diagnosis. M. PeÃ±a Vilabelda: A.

Over the past years, the convergence of genomic technologies has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci by means of linkage studies. Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. We analysed two families showing both autism and epilepsy. The first one is the family of a woman, showing a severe and progressive epileptic disorder, who is married with an healthy man and has six children: two girls are healthy, a girl and two boys are affected by autism, while a boy showed partial seizures only twice. The three children with autism show a moderate mental retardation and an EEG with no epileptic alterations. The second family is composed by an epileptic woman married with a healthy man and their child affected by autism.The genetic basis of autism and epilepsy were studied in these  families. In particular, we performed an array CGH analysis to search for pathological CNVs which are common to all affected members of the two families.The study detected a single common region on chromosome 15q11.2, which has already been reported to be either deleted or duplicated in about 1% of epileptic patients. Moreover, the same region was associated with ASDs (autism spectrum disorders).

474,746, M An hiPSCs based in vitro model of Angelman Syndrome and dup15 Autism,P08.70,,"UBE3A gene maps on 15q11q13 chromosome and encodes for the pro tein E6AP , an Ubiquitine ligase involved in protein degradation process. The gene is maternally imprinted in central nervous system and different studies show that loss of expressed copy causes Angelman Sydrome (AS) while the duplication of 15q11q13 represents the genetic cause in 1 3% of autistic patients (dup15 Autism). Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists. In the other hand this new challenging and arduous technology give to the scientists the possibility to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms in tissues that for obviously reasons are difficult to study.",2014,,"F.

Over the past years, the convergence of genomic technologies has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci by means of linkage stu dies. Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. Recently, a role of potassium inward rectifying channels in the pathogenesis of autism disease has been postu lated due to the identification in patients affected by autism and epilepsy of two mutations in the KCNJ10 gene. The gene encodes the Kir4.1 channel which is expressed in astrocytes and neurons.We then searched for mutati   on in the KNCJ10 gene, as well as in two genes (KCNJ2 and KCNJ16) coding for additional Kir channels with reported expression in astrocytes and neu rons, in two unrelated patients. We detected a new mutation in the KCNJ2 gene in a boy affected by autism.

The world  wide average prevalence of ASDs is 1 in 160 children and1 3% of ID. Due to the genetic heterogeneity of these pathologies different genetic tests are available. Today,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1439chromosomal microarray is the ï¬rst tier recommended diagnostic test and provides a yield around 10 15% for ID patients and around 9% for ASDs patients, depending on the cohort. Our goal is to evaluate if the diagnostic yield estimated by targeted sequencing in our cohorts of ID or ASDs subjects is higher than that obtained by CGH array.We screened 701 in house selected ID related genes and 189 autism related genes in a cohort of more than 100 and 60 patients, respectively. Libraries were prepared withdifferent capture kits and the Illumina NextSeq500 platform was used to sequence targeted regions. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with an in house pipeline. Thediagnostic yield was 41% in the ID cohort and 20% in the ASDs cohort. Variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 50% of the ID patients and 72% of the autism patients and negative results were obtained in 9% and 8% of the ID and autism individuals, respectively.

774,461,A Heterozygous de novo truncating mutation of nucleolin in an ASD individual disrupts its nucleolar localization,P09.030,,"J. B. Vincent1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada,2Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,3Queen âs University,, Kingston, ON, Canada, 4University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Worcester, MA, United States Introduction: Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein, playing a critical role in multiple processes, including ribosome assembly and maturation, chromatin decondensa tion, and pre rRNA transcription. Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p.Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen  cing of an autism spectrum disorder trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C  terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis  localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p.Gly664*, shows a very similar effect on the location of the NCL protein, thus con ï¬rming the presence of the nucleolar location signal of NCL protein in this region. FRAP showssigniï¬cant changes in the kinetics and mobility of mutant NCL protein in the nucleoplasm. Conclusions: Several other studies have also reported de novo mutations in NCL in ASD or neurodevelopmental dis  orders. Altered mislocalization and dynamics of mutant NCL (p.G664Glufs*70/ p.G664*) may have relevance to the etio pathlogy of NCL related neurodevelopmental phenotypes. T.I. Sheikh: None. N. Vasli: None.

125,297,Clinical report: a new case of macrocephaly/autism  syndrome ( MIM00 ) with a germline PTEN  tumor suppressor  gene mutation,P0160.,,"Macrocephaly is found in approximately 20% of patients with autism.  In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes. The possibility of developing spe   cific alterations of Cowden disease during the second decade should  be considered.

Since some  CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini   cal significance of de novo  and inherited CNVs containing genes being  transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive   ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were  grouped into four categories. First, de novo  CNVs in families with both  parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from  a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely  to be causally related to ASD. The genes in these two categories par   ticipate in pathways probably associated with ASD, such as contactin  based cell communication ( CNTN5 , CNTN6 ), phosphoinositol signaling  (PIK3CA ), and regulation of neurotransmitter levels ( KCNMB4 , TPH2 ).  The de novo  CNVs found in patients with at least one parent scoring  higher than 1 SD above the mean on the SRS, and the CNVs inher   ited from an unaffected parent, while the other parent has an elevated  SRS score, are likely to exert a minor contribution to the phenotype.  Our analysis also indicates that in 6 out of 48 ASD patients two or more  genetic etiologies may be involved.

Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study.

R462X is not able to rescue spine volume and dendritic branching and lacks postsynaptic clustering, indicating the most severe dysfunction. To demonstrate that R462X when expressed in mouse can be linked to phy   siological effects, we analyzed synaptic transmission and behavior. Princi   pal neurons of mice expressing rAAV transduced SHANK2 R462X present a specific, long lasting reduction in miniature postsynaptic AMPA receptor currents.

We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p.Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family.

A similarly affected sister (autism spectrum disorder, anxiety and intellectual impairment) and their clinically depressed mother also carried the duplication. The mother has normal intellect. Another clini cally depressed sibling with normal intellect did not carry the duplication. Methylation studies showed that the duplication had been inherited from the maternal grandfather who had normal intellect and absence of psych iatric disease.Duplication of 15q11 q13 has previously been associated with cognitive impairment, autism, and psychiatric disease. Furthermore, the maternally inherited duplication most likely confers this phenotype whereas paternally derived duplications primarily show normal phenotypes.Our family provides additional evidence that autism, psychiatric disease and intellectual disability segregate with a maternally inherited duplication at 15q11 q13 although with variable presentation. The presence of depression in the non carrier sister however, suggests a lack of association between cli nical depression and the chromosomal duplication in this family, providing evidence that this duplication does not play a strong role in depression.

Methods: We studied the association between CNVs and savant skills among  1108 children diagnosed with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) database. Savant skills were determined based on five designated questions from the autism diagnostic interview revised (ADI R) questionnaire. CNVs  data were retrieved from a genome wide analysis of CNVs in these children. Results: Savant skills were significantly more prevalent in our sample than in other children with ASD in the SSC cohort (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Child   ren with savant skills had, on average, a higher IQ (93.0ÃÂ±24.2 vs. 79.1ÃÂ±25.5; P<0.001), and a larger head circumference (HC) (54.3ÃÂ±2.55 vs. 53.8ÃÂ±2.60; P , 0.003).

But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano  metry.

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together. Conclusion: Autistic individuals with higher genetic burden for the disorder, including large rare CNVs andhigher load of PRS, have different bene ï¬ts of SSGT com  pared with individuals with lower genetic risk.

442,1936,Abnormal growth and dysmorphic features in children with autism spectrum disorders,J06.06,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are very heterogeneous neurodevelop mental disorders of children diagnosed solely on the basis of the triad of per   sistent social and language deficits and stereotypic behaviors. Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism. Identifiable endophenotypes and reliable biomarkers within ASDs would help to focus molecular research and uncover genetic causes and deve lopmental mechanisms.  D. Avdjieva Tzavella: None. S.

431,1526,Rare Variant Extensions of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test Detects Associations with Autism Exome Sequence Data,P16.106,,"Many population based rare variant association tests have been developed to analyze sequence data. A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise   quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa   tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7  gene. Given  the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorders or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorders (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorders without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

Different studies have already pointed to  an impairment of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity as an underlying cause of SCZ pathology. To elucidate a putative contribution of genetic SHANK3 variants  to the etiology of SCZ, we sequenced the gene in 500 affected individuals and compared the sequencing results to ancestral   ly matched controls. Novel SHANK3 missense variants were identified in 1.6 % of the screened individuals, three of which were predicted as deleterious by at least two different algorithms. We identified association of 5 genetic variants, with study wide significance(P<0.001). Combined with previous studies, the rare G>V variant was  found in 4 out of 1543 SCZ patients and in 4 out of 2147 individuals with autismspectrum disorders (ASD), but not in 9315 controls.We conclude that the SHANK3  gene harbors different genetic variations predisposing to SCZ, ranging from common and uncommon va riants torare deleterious missense mutations.

These patients share common clinical features including early onset obesity, intellectual disabili ty and behavioral troubles or autism. A minimal critical region of 1.97 Mb has been estimated, encompassing seven genes (SH3HYL1 , ACP1, TMEM18 ,  SNTG2, TPO, PXDN, and MYT1L). Many recent studies pointed out MYT1L  gene as the main candidate for ID and obesity. We present three new pa tients carrying 2p25 deletions: an autist female child with developmental delay and her depressive father, and a third unrelated patient who has psy   chomotor retardation and behavioral troubles. Moreover, our patients do not have an overweight phenotype, highlighting indeed the role of MYT1L  in obesity, as none of the deletions encompasses MYT1L. The only common  disrupted gene is SNTG2, thus redefining the smallest region of overlap for  autism. SNTG2 is expressed in brain. Its product interacts with neuroligins  NLGN3, NLGN4X, and NLGN4Y, which are autism related isoforms. Finally, the parental origin of the deletions seems to be of interest, as all inherited deletions described today appear to be inherited from the paternal side.

Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.

479,778, S Three SNP haplotypes in Neuroligins may correlate to autism susceptibility,P09.021,,"Chemistry  and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

Recently, the identification of the Preserved Speech  Variant (PSV), where autistic behavior is usual, stressed the  phenotypic overlap between these two conditions. In 1999 it was  shown that about 80% of RTT cases have a de novo  mutation in  the transcriptional silencer MECP2  gene, classifying RTT as a  monogenic X L dominant disorder. Subsequently, we and others  provided evidence that this model was too simple and not sufficient  to explain why germline MECP2  mutations may result in X L mental  retardation in males while they may be silent in carrier females. On  the other hand, we and others have provided evidence that 15q11  q13 maternally inherited duplications are found in autistic children,  suggesting that an abnormal dosage of gene(s) within this region  might be responsible for A. Now we show that a proportion of RTT  patients are carriers of both a MECP2  mutation and a 15q11 q13  duplication and that other RTT patients are carriers of a MECP2   mutation and a 15q11 q13 duplication. Therefore, we hypothesize  a complex model in which a MECP2  mutation is necessary but not  sufficient to cause the RTT phenotype in females, based on the  status of a second gene which, at least in a proportion of cases, may  be abnormal dosage of one or more 15q11 q13 gene.

175,1155,the BDNF receptor gene NTRK  is a susceptibility gene for  autism,P06.034,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely determined by multiple genes . The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant  transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns  5 6  and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) .

No muta   tions were identified in these individuals, and there was no evidence  for association of NTRK2 with plasma BDNF distribution .

It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010,,S.

294,1315,PON1 phenotype and gene polymorphisms in children with autism,J09.01,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology.  Many genetic and environmental factors are incriminated in its pathogenesis. Subacute exposure to organophosphates (OPs) during critical periods of prenatal neurodevelopment is one of the factors that may trigger autism. Human serum paraoxonase (PON1)  is a HDL associated hydrolase, which in addition to hydrolyzing the OPs, plays a physiological role in reducing LDL oxidation. The PON1 gene shows two functional polymorphisms: M55L and Q192R. These polymorphisms influence the concentration and activity of PON1 towards different substrates, including OPs.The gene environment interaction is tested in the present study by assessing the distribution and frequency of M55L and Q192R polymorphisms in 58 autistic children and 43 controls.No significant difference (p>0.05) in genotypes distribution was found  between autistic patients and controls (QQ 51.72%, QR 43.1%, RR 5.17% / MM 12.1%, ML 60.3%, LL 27.6% for autistic group and QQ 51.16%, QR 44.18%, RR 4.65% / MM 9.3%, ML 53.5%, LL 37.2% for control group).Although, the paraoxonase activity did not present a significant difference between the patients and controls (p>0.05), there was a significant activity increase in the autistic groups with R allele number and both in autistic and control groups with L allele number (p<0.05). The arylesterase activity was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in autistic patients, with no relation to the number of R alleles, but increased in relation with L allele number (p<0.05).These results provide support for the hypothesis that PON1 arylesterase activity could represent a biochemical/genetic test in  estimating autism risk.",2011,,"E.

Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis. Three novel (p.Asp331Thrfs*11,  p.Thr321Glnfs*23, p.Glu242*) and two known germline mutations  (p.Pro246Leu, p.Arg130*) have been found in 8 of the 53 probands (15%). We discuss possible genotype/phenotype correlation in our group of pati   ents. Our data support former findings that PTEN mutations are frequent  in patients with ASDs and macrocephaly. Therefore PTEN testing should  be considered in such patients. The findings may impact the assessment of  the recurrence risk and medical management of the families including early cancer prevention.

This  finding leads to the suggestion that all cases of undiagnosed MR should be  screened for subtelomeric aberration. Nevertheless, resolution of standard karyotyping using G banding is limited and cannot detect this anomaly.  Therefore, in this study, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification  (MLPA) technique, was used to screen 129 patients with idiopathic MR.  Twelve of them were also diagnosed with autistic disorder. We identified 5 patients (3.87%) with subtelomeric aberration. All have MR with normal ka ryotypes. One patient has a submicroscopic deletion at 1p36.33 which was  confirmed by real time PCR. There are two patients with subtelomeric du  plication at 15q11.2 and 11p15.5 subsequently. Two patients have the same  duplication at Xp22.33. Results were confirmed by using additional MLPA probes. Parental samples were also examined when available. Interestingly the deletion at 1p36.33 and duplication at Xp22.33 fall into the regions whe  re copy number variation (CNV) have been reported. However the patholo   gic effect of these aberrations is still inconclusive. Further characterization  of these aberration boundaries and screening in normal population should be performed.

The diagnosis of autism is based on impairments in reciprocal social interaction  and communication, and restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests  and activities, with abnormal development apparent within the first 3 years of life. Autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) include: autistic disorder, child  hood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not other   wise specified, Asperger syndrome and Rett syndrome. There is substantial  evidence from twin and family studies to support the involvement of genetic factors in ASDs.

He was unable to follow commands and responded to  his name very rarely. The child was born after 8 yrs of a non consanguineous  marriage, gestation was controlled and it was a full term caesarean delivery.

Genetic and cytogenetic studies revealed that most of the chromosomes are associated with autism, abnormalities of  chromosomes 15 and X being most frequently documented. AIM OF THE STUDY: Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood samples from children with autism was performed to identify possible structural or nume rical chromosomal abnormalities by GTG banding. RESULTS: The study revealed normal karyotypes in most cases (47 out of  50 individuals). Two of the male patients had modified karyotypes (2% mo saicism): chromosome 9qh+ polymorphism and terminal deletion on chro  mosome 15q, respectively. One of the female patients had an extra chromo  some 8 (2% mosaicism).CONCLUSION: This is the first cytogenetic testing performed specifically on  autistic children in Romania. Our results show that karyotyping analysis is not conclusive in most cases with autism.

481,780, S Genetic evidence that hyperactive Th2 and NK immune pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder,P09.023,,"Converging evidence suggests that abnormal immunity is involved in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) both in children and  adults. Altered immune processes include ongoing neuroinflammation in  post mortem brains, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal  fluid and blood, altered immune cell function, presence of brain specific  auto antibodies, and dysregulated immune transcriptome. One strategy to  assess whether dysimmunity contributes to ASD pathogenesis or represents  a collateral by standing effect is to investigate whether functional SNPs  known to influence immune gene expression or function are associated with  ASD. We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro  band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in  all major immune pathways. Statistically significant opposite transmission  patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression  and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite  alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi  nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG)  activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autistic disorder in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014,,"I.

It varies from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifesta tions and an increased risk of toxicity from 5  ï¬uorouracil treatment. Materials and Methods: A child with severe autistic behavior, intellectual disability (no speech at 6 years old) and family history   aunt with mental retardation, was referred for genetic counseling. Metabolic screening wasperformed in urine sample by dipstick   glucose, ketone, pH, and reducing sugars, followed by LC MS/MS blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines and GC/MS urine organicacids analysis. Mutations in DPYD gene are reported in DPD de ï¬ciency patients. The gene was investigated by direct Sanger sequencing in proband and his parents. Results: Elevated levels of thymine and uracil were detected by GC/MS urine test which was suggestive of DPD deï¬ciency. Molecular analysis of DPYD gene showed a homozygous splice site mutation c.1905 +1G>A in the proband, inherited from heterozygous parents. Subse  quently, prenatal testing in the family was performed. Thefetus was healthy non carrier. Conclusion: Here we report the ï¬rst Bulgarian patient with severe autistic disorder caused by DPD de ï¬ciency and subsequent prenatal diagnostics performed in the family. As patients with this de ï¬ciency could be easily detected by determination of the thymine uraciluria, screening for thesedefects are indicative for all patients with any autistic behavior and intellectual disability. It also could be useful for those patients who are going to be treated with 5 ï¬uorouracil to prevent lethal toxicities and personalise treatments. M.B. Ivanova: None. V. Jordanova: None. T.

95,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples.

It has an incidence of 1:10,000  female births and is characterized by apparently normal development  for the first 6 18 months of life followed by the loss of acquired motor  and language skills, autistic features, and development of stereotypic  hand movements. Rett syndrome is caused primarily by de novo mu   tations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Methyl  CpG binding protein 2 plays important roles in the regulation of gene  expression and RNA splicing. Here we report the mutational analysis  of the MECP2 gene in 95 patients from the Czech and Slovak Repub   lics and the Ukraine with classical Rett syndrome. The patients, all  girls, were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing of the entire  coding sequence and the exon/intron boundaries of the MECP2 gene.  RFLP analysis was performed to confirm the mutations that cause the  creation or abolition of the restriction site. Mutation negative cases  were subsequently examined by multiple ligation dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) to identify large deletions. Sequencing analysis  revealed 33 different mutations in 74 patients, and MLPA analysis re   vealed large deletions in two patients. The detection rate was 78%.  One mutation in exon 1 (c.48_55del8) has not been published yet. Our  results confirm the high frequency of MECP2 mutations in females with  Rett syndrome and provide data concerning the mutation heterogene   ity in the Slavonic population.

Both children were born from healthy non consanguineous parents . Clinical investigations included neurological evaluation, EEG, and MRI . Chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lympho   cytes, by GTG banding. Locus specific BAC probes for critical region 15q11 13 and control probes were used for FISH analysis . Normal karyotype, and 15q microdeletion was demonstrated in both cases . In the second case, the phenotype was highly suggestive for Angel   man syndrome, while in the first case, a differential diagnosis with Rett  syndrome was considered, especially because of the severe vertebral scoliosis .

We describe a 6 year old male with a 1.2 Mb de novo  deletion of  2p16.3 detected by aCGH (Agilent 244K). Most of NRXN1  is missing  and no other known genes are within the deletion. The child has minor  dysmorphic features: triangular open mouth, inverted and supernu   merary nipples. Growth parameters, including head circumference are  within normal limits. At the age of 9 months he had several seizure epi   sodes successfully controlled with valproic acid. Mental development  is delayed (absent speech) and the patient presents typical autistic  features. Brain MRI was unremarkable. As the deletion is de novÃÂ¿ and the missing segment only encompasses  part of NRXN1 , it is highly likely that haploinsuficieny of this gene is  causally related to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype.

An 8 year old girl was referred for chromosome analysis because of  heart defect, dysmorphic facial features, mild mental retardation and  autistic features including a delay of speech development. Karyotyping  revealed derivative chromosomes 20 and 22. For further clarification of  the rearrangement, FISH was performed using 20p and 20q subtelo   meric probes. It showed that material from 20p was translocated onto  22p. Array CGH was essential for the identification of the suspected  third partner in this CCR: It showed a 3q duplication of about 16.5 Mb,  and the CCR thus involved chromosomes 3, 20 and 22. Karyotyping and FISH analysis of other relatives indicated that four  members of this family are carriers of a balanced form of this CCR.  These individuals are asymptomatic. Four of their descendants have  two types of unbalanced CCRs. The proband and her maternal aunt  have partial duplications of chromosome 3. Both have similar dysmor   phic facial features and mental retardation, but the aunt is lacking the  heart defect and autism. Two other individuals have partial duplica   tions of chromosome 20.

Her deletion spans 2.3  Mb (chr6:14545576 16846846, hg19) and includes JARID2 , DTNBP1   and MYLIP , in addition to GMPR  and ATXN1 . Because the GMP re   ductases encoded by GMPR and GMPR2  have redundant functions,  haploinsufficiency of GMPR  is not likely causing the cognitive impair   ments in our patients.

Mutations of SH2D1A  are  responsible for the X linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. We present 3 patients from 2 families with complete deletions of the  SH2D1A  gene. The first patient was an 18 year old man with Burkitt Cancer genetics1 lymphoma treated by intensive chemotherapy at the age of 16 followed  by severe aplastic anaemia treated by stem cell transplantation from  his brother. Molecular analysis showed a deletion of all SH2D1A  exons.  His maternal cousin, a 25 year old man with mild learning difficulties,  mild autistic features and severe epidermolysis bullosa like dermatitis  that manifested at the age of 8 years, carried the same deletion. Due  to this atypical phenotype, array CGH was performed to specify the  extent of the deletion. It was about 65 kb long and removed also the 3Ã¢ÂÂ  terminal part of the ODZ1  gene. The molecular defect was identical in  both cousins. The third patient was a 20 year old man who developed  EBV driven lymphoproliferation at the age of 3. He recovered after  chemotherapy and now, at the age of 21, he is well, suffering only from  hypogammaglobulinaemia. His brother died of lymphoproliferation in  infancy.

246,1501,A 134 kb duplication 0.5 mb upstream of sOX9  associated with hermaphroditism in an XX male and autism in  his XY brother,P12.200,,"In a sibship of six a 46,XX male hermaphrodite with ovotestes and no  detectable SRY sequence had a brother with infantile autism without  mental retardation. Both brothers had inherited an identical 134 Kb  duplication of the regulatory genomic region 0.5 Mb upstream of SOX9  from their mother. In another brother who had inherited the same ma   ternal SOX9 haplotype, no upstream duplication was found, proving  that the mother was a gonadal mosaic for the duplication. We hypoth   esize that the duplication caused sufficient SRY independent SOX9  expression in the undifferentiated fetal gonads to promote testicular  development. Apparently, this effect was tissue  and/or fetal specific as  no SOX9 expression was detectable in leukocytes and skin fibroblasts  from any of the siblings. The observations in the family also suggest  that such a SOX9 regulatory region duplication may predispose for  autism in the presence of a Y chromosome, i.e. a SRY gene. This hy   pothesis is supported by the SOX9 segregation pattern which as a less  than 8,2 % probability of being a random event, and the unexplained  general excess of autistic features in males. We therefore propose that  an additional role of SOX9, directly linked to testicular differentiation,  could be the promotion of male specific brain development. Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders ",2010,,"A.

Extremely rare is association of Phelan McDer   mid syndrome and hepatic failure in early childhood. There have been de  scribed only 2 patients with this condition so far. In these cases PIM3 gene  (localized in 22q13.33) was considered to be responsible. We present 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with Phelan McDermid syn drome. Age at diagnosis ranges from 10 month to 55 years and deletion ex   tent varies from 0.4 Mb to 7.6 Mb. All patients present common features  of the syndrome, but they differ in inconstant sypmtoms. Any correlations  between phenotype and deletion range havenâ²t been observed.Patients have been diagnosed using FISH and MLPA, deletion extents were  proven by oligonucleotide arrayCGH. There are 6 patients with deleted PIM3 gene in our group, including two adult patients, but only one of these patients (10 year old boy with 1.9 Mb  long deletion) has developed hepatic failure recently. Therefore simple PIM3  deletion doesnâ²t seem to be the cause of hepatic failure.The possible mechanism is an alteration of the gene on the other allele, epi genetic factors or mutation in some modifier genes. We discuss potential  benefit of whole exome sequencing to further elucidate mechanism in these  patients.Support: Czech Ministry of Health project 00064203.  R. PourovÃ¡: None. P.

388,648, BKCa channels: a new therapeutic target in Fragile X Syndrome treatment,P05.067,,"The most common cause of inherited mental deficiency (MD) associated  with autistic features, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), results from the FMR1 gene  silencing and loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among synaptic proteins deregulated by the absence of Fmrp in fmr1  knock out  (KO) mice (murine model for FXS), Kcnma1 (Î± subunit of large conductance Ca 2+ activated potassium channels, BKCa) seems to be the most significant  deregulated one. Since several papers showed an involvement of BKCa chan nels in MD, this channel could be a new therapeutic target for FXS. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the molecular BKCa channel anomaly in fmr1  KO mouse model and 2) to evaluate the thera  peutic effect of a BKCa channel opener molecule (BCOM), BMS 204352, on dendritic spines maturation of fmr1  KO neurons and on social behavior of  fmr1  KO mice. In fmr1  KO mice, Kcnma1 protein quantity was lower in ce  rebral structures and neurons, and associated with a reduced BKCa whole cell current. In vitro addition of BMS 204352 induced dendrite spines ma  turation of fmr1  KO neurons. In vivo, using a behavioral test of direct social  interaction, a single injection of BMS 204352 rescued affiliative behaviors to wild type level. In conclusion, we demonstrated 1) a Kcnma1 protein anomaly in fmr1  KO  mice inducing a decrease in BKCa whole cell current, and 2) that a BCOM, BMS 204352, restored a regular phenotype of dendrite spines and social interaction in fmr1  KO mice. Therefore, BKCa channel could be a new thera  peutic target in FXS treatment.  B. Hebert: None. O. Perche: None. A. Menuet: None. N. Doisne: None. J. Pichon:  None. B. Laudier: None. S.

MedykÃ³w 18,,  Katowice, Poland. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation respon   sible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1  gene resulting in its transcriptional silencing. Leptin may be  considered a cytokine like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, immune system, in addition to its role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. Thus, we hypothesized on in volvement of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of autism.Material and methods23 male patients, mean age 19,3 Â± 6,6, affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1  gene), were enrolled into the study. Controls were 24  healthy males, mean age 21,8 Â± 5,8. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA method.ResultsPlasma leptin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients were similar as in con trol group (11,53 Â± 10,24 ng/ml) vs (5,73 Â± 4,52) were not significantly dif   ferent from those found in controls (p , 0,5).While plasma adiponectin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients (6,68 Â± 3,44 ng/ml) were significantly lower in controls (8,95 Â± 4,24) (p< 0,04).ConclusionAdiponectin may be involved in autistic features observed in FXS patients in light of its anti inflammatory properties.

One third of them harbored autistic features.We identified causative mutations in 26 patients: sixteen in X linked ge nes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD , FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1 , IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA,  MECP2, SLC9A6 , SLC16A2, PHF8), 10 de novo in autosomal genes (DYRK1A ,  GRIN1 , MED13L , TCF4, RAI1 , SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 ). We detected likely  causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3  for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge  nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit  more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions.  The identification of mutations in 25 29% of patients proves the diagnostic efficiency of this strategy, higher than CGH and comparable to trio exome sequencing at lesser cost.

470,733, M NPAS3 related copy number variants: a role in developmental delay?,P08.56,,"Neuronal PAS domain containing protein 3 (NPAS3) is a transcription factor expressed primarily in developing and adult brain tissues. Current evidence  suggests it is involved in neuronal development and maturation, and it has  recently been highlighted as potentially playing a key role in the evolution of the human brain. Clinically, NPAS3 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and numerous studies have supported this association. In addition, several cases of learning disabilities in patients with disruptions of this gene are reported, but this association remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present four unrelated individuals with small copy number vari ants (CNVs) within NPAS3: two intragenic duplications and two intragenic deletions. These CNVs range between 111 460kb in length and encompass  exonic sequences within the NPAS3 gene. All four patients had variable de   grees of developmental delay, and three had subtle distinctive facial features.  Two patients also had macrosomia and macrocephaly, while the other two had autistic features and behaviour issues, including psychosis in one indivi dual. In contrast, CNVs involving exonic sequences in NPAS3 have only been seen in one of over 19,000 controls. In summary, these four cases support an association between NPAS3 and developmental delay.

In this study, we observed MEF2C haploinsufficiency in 1,5% (95% confidence interval: 0 3.2%) of patients with ASD. This is the first study to look specifically at MEF2C in ASD. Of note, a mutation in MEF2C was also found once by whole exome sequencing in another cohort of 175 trios with ASD.

All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which,  along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3  males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel  lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency.

One had widely set nipples and hypotonia. Another  one had a short statue. Two patients presented with ocular hypertelorism. HDAC4 haploinsufficiency was observed in all three cases. Conclusions. We show that 2q37 deletions can be common in children with  ID, autism, congenital malformations tending to a frequency as high as 1%. Therefore, one can suggest that 2q37.3 deletions are likely to be more com  mon among these children than previously recognized.

613,696, Mosaic Xq26,P08.64,,"Introduction. Recurrent mosaic duplications are exclusive in the available literature. This is especially the case in terms of clinically relevant X chro mosome duplications in females. However, a growing amount of reports on somatic genome variations causing intellectual disability and congenital malformations allows speculations that mosaic (sub)chromosomal rear rangements might be more common and clinically relevant than previously recognized.Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping using SNP/oligonucleotide microarray (resolution: >1 kbp) was performed in a cohort of 402 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformati ons.Results. Four girls (~1%) have exhibited mosaic duplications spanning Xq26.2q26.3.The age varied from 1 year 1 month to 6 years. Shared features included intellectual disability/developmental delay, microcephaly, broad phyltrum and wide nasal bridge, long lashes, ptosis; one patient demonstrated autistic features. The overlapping region for all duplications included 8 genes: GPC3,  MIR19B2 , MIR106A, PHF6, HPRT1, MIR503, MIR424, PLAC1. Although non  mosaic duplication in this region involving genes PHF6 and HPRT1 has been  described in the literature previously, the lack of phenotypic resemblance to the detected cases and an original bioinformatics analysis allow the specu lation that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 might be a new chromosomal syndrome associated with intellectual disability and congenital malforma tions.Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 are relatively common in children with intellectual disability, autism, epi lepsy and/or congenital malformations. Furthermore, our findings demon   strate the possibility that mosaic chromosomal rearrangements can be a cause for a new chromosomal syndrome.

The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication can be associated with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. The aim was to assess the neural networks involved in visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval in ASD due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication.Materials and methods: A woman with autistic features, macrocephaly and body asymmetry due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication and 7 healthy controls were investigated. Six runs of BOLD fMRI data were collected to assess the networks of the visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval; a single run of encoding task was followed by 10 minute retention period, then 2 runs of the retrieval tasks both for visual and verbal domain respectively. During encoding participants were instructed to memorize the task stimu li, whilst during retrieval they were instructed to decide whether the given image or word was presented during the encoding period. Data analysis was performed using the SPM8 toolbox under Matlab, with standard processing steps.Results: In patient fMRI for visual memory encoding/retrieval showed hig her activation in the posterior insulae, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared to the controls where visual areas were predominant in these tasks. Verbal memory activation was higher in the hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, precuneus; and lower in the anterior insulae; higher visual areas in our patient compared to the controls.Conclusion: The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication resulted in peculiar activity pat   tern of the brain responsible for visual and verbal memory in ASD.

Molecular and clinical data from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations from other centers were also collected, focusing on developmental aspects and the associated epilepsy phenotype. A review of SYNGAP1 mutations published in the lite rature was also performed.Results: We describe 17 unrelated affected individuals carrying 13 diffe rent novel loss of function SYNGAP1 mutations. Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1 related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviors in eight patients. Hypotonia and unstable gait were frequent as sociated neurological features. With the exception of one patient who ex   perienced a single seizure, all patients had epilepsy, characterized by falls or head drops due to atonic or myoclonic seizures, (myoclonic) absences, and/or eyelid myoclonia. Triggers of seizures were frequent (n,7). Seizures were pharmacoresistant in half of the patients. The severity of the epilepsy did not correlate with the presence of autistic features or with the severity of cognitive impairment. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, but spared spliced 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons.

660,1861," Patient with language impairment, intellectual disability, autism and de novo truncating FOXP1 variant helps to define emerging somatic phenotype associated with FOXP1 defects",P08.16,,"FOXP1 (forkhead box protein P1) is a transcription factor important in neu rodevelopment. Thirteen patients with de novo protein disrupting intrage  nic FOXP1 variants have been reported. They have language impairment,  developmental delay/intellectual disability (ID) and autistic features. We report an 8 year old boy with severe language impairment, moderate ID and atypical autism. His speech regressed at 18 months of age and started to improve again since 5 years of age. However, expressive speech is severely affected and shows no progress. The boy is hyperactive and anxious. Other features include hypotonia, mild facial dysmorphism, hypermetropia and strabismus.Karyotyping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Targeted next ge   neration sequencing using the TruSight Autism panel (Illumina) identified a private heterozygous nonsense FOXP1 mutation (NM_032682.5:c.1319C>G,p. S440*), which was confirmed using Sanger sequencing in the patient but in neither of his parents indicating its de novo nature. The aberrant transcript is likely removed by nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and FOXP1 haploin  sufficiency was proposed as the main pathogenic mechanism. If the tran script escaped NMD, the p.S440* mutation would truncate FOXP1 between the leucine zipper dimerization domain and the FOX DNA binding domain. A recently functionally characterized neighbouring FOXP1 variant p.Y439* showed aberrant protein localization.Our patient supports the role of FOXP1 in language, cognition and behaviour,  and helps to define the emerging characteristic somatic phenotype of FOXP1  mutation carriers which may include prominent forehead, frontal hair ups weep, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, low set ears, short nose with a broad tip and smooth philtrum.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.

680,17, Gonadal mosaicism: its contribution for de novo events,P01.25,,"1LaboratÃ³rio de CitogenÃ©tica e GenÃ³mica da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Por  tugal,2CIMAGO   Centro de InvestigaÃ§Ã£o em Ambiente, GenÃ©tica e Oncobiologia, Faculdade de Medicina da Uni versidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, 3CNC IBILI, Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal,4ServiÃ§o de ObstetrÃ­cia A, Centro Hospitalar e UniversitÃ¡rio de Coim bra, Coimbra, Portugal, 5Centro do Desenvolvimento da828CrianÃ§a, Centro Hospitalar e UniversitÃ¡rio de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism.

Yudkin1 1Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation,2Novosibirsk State Med  ical University, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation,3Novosi  birsk State Regional Clinical Diagnostic Center, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation,4Novosibirsk State Uni  versity, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation Introduction: A cytogenetic and molecular genetic study of the family with a male child who had mental retardation and autistic features revealed an abnormal chromosome 13 bearing an enlarged p arm with ampli ï¬ed ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in a boy and his father. Study and results: Cytogenetic analysis using standard G banding and FISH with labeled rDNA probes revealed an abnormalchromosome 13 with an enlarged p arm due to rDNA ampli ï¬cation in a male child, who had clinically con ï¬rmed mental retardation and an autistic behavior. This chromo some is evidently inherited from the father, who has mor  phologically the same chromosome, but is healthy. The karyotype of the mother was normal. Ag NOR stainingshowed brightly stained large whole p arm nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) in a child and normal sized NORs in his father with 13p + NOR amount mosaicism. qRT PCR with speci ï¬c primers showed highly increased levels of 18 S, 28 S and 5,8 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the patient âs blood samples compared to a normal healthy control donor. Both patient âs father and mother had no elevated levels of rRNAs expression. Conclusions: In this case rRNA level seems to correlate with mental retardationin familial individuals with 13p +. Our ï¬ndings of rRNA overexpression in a patient with mental retardation and his parents may show a possible link between the karyotype (p arm enlargement due to rDNA ampli ï¬cation), rDNA func  tionality (rRNA overexpression), functional changes in the brain and mental retardation.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col  laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var  iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand  or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno  types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

The most frequent cause of mono  genic ID   the fragile X syndrome  is due to the absence of the RNA binding protein (RBP) FMRP. Many other IDgenes have been implicated in the RNA metabolism. NOVA2 is a RBP known to regulate neuron speci ï¬c alternative splicing (AS). We identi ï¬ed 6 individuals with de novo frameshift variants in NOVA2 affected with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by ID, motor and speech delay, autistic features, spasticity or ataxic gaitand abnormal brain MRI. All variants cluster in a small GC  repeat rich region, located in the last exon, indicating that the mutated transcript might escape to nonsense mediated decay. All 6 frameshift variants lead to the addition of a novel common C terminal part instead of the last KH RNA binding domain, suggesting a dominant negative mechan  ism. We detected 41 genes differentially spliced after downregulation of NOVA2 in human neuronal cells. TheNOVA2 variant protein shows decreased ability to bind target RNA sequences and to regulate target AS events. It also fails to complement the effect on neurite outgrowthinduced by NOVA2 downregulation in vitro and to rescue alterations of retinotectal axonal path ï¬nding induced by loss of NOVA2 ortholog in zebra ï¬sh. Our results showed that truncating mutations in NOVA2 cause a syndromic form of ID, suggesting a hypomorphic mechanism rather than a full heterozygous loss of function, although a speci ï¬c con  tribution of the novel C terminal extension cannot be excluded.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 33F.

Introduction: Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that can be isolatedor syndromic. Biallelic ALDH1A3 variants are responsible for 11% of recessive AM cases, mostly described in consanguineous families, and present severe bilateral AM with variable neurodevelopmen tal anomalies. We present six families with biallelic ALDH1A3 variants, further characterising the associated phenotype. Material and Methods: AM individuals from UK, France and Spain were analysed by WES, targeted gene screening and arrays. Results: We identi ï¬ed 6 families: Family 1) with two brothers with bilateral anophthalmia, one present additional developmen tal delay, absent speech and autism with compound heterozygousALDH1A3 variants (c.874G>T:p.(D292Y);c.1393A>T:p.(I465F)); 2) a boy with bilateral anophthalmia, developmental and intellectual delay, seizures and autistic features with compound heterozygous variants (c.845G>C:p.(G282A);c.1459A>G:p.(R487G)); 3) a girl withbilateral microphthalmia and coloboma with compound hetero zygous variants (c.847_849del;p.(G283del);c.953C>A,:p.(S318Y)); 4) a girl with bilateral anophthalmia with a homozygous missense variant (c.1144G>A:p.(G382R)); 5) a boy with bilateral microphthal mia, unilateral coloboma and cataract, with a homozygous splice variant (c.1233 +2T>C) and 6) a boy with bilateral microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, facial dysmorphism with ahomozygous missense variant (c.434C>T:p.A145V). Conclusions: Three of the six families presented with com pound heterozygous variants, highlighting this mode of inheri tance in ALDH1A3 related disorders. Five of 6 families had a variant in the catalytic domain, supporting the importance of this domain,which is critical for substrate selectivity.

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER. This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore. To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com  pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases. The subject âs transcriptome showed increased expression (>5sd) of genes including the ATP2A3 calcium pump and purinergic receptors, and extremely lowexpression (>24sd) of VDAC2, a mitochondrial calcium uptake channel.

332,530, Clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with de novo 0.45 Mb deletion of 2p16.1,P03.102,,"The widespread use of microarray methods has contributed to the identi fication of several new rare microdeletion syndromes including that asso   ciated with deletions of 2p15 p16.1. The 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndro me is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, microcephaly, growth retardation, facial abnormalities, disturbed vision and other symptoms. We report here an 11 year old autistic girl showing clinical features consistent with the syndrome. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of the patient showed a normal female karyotype. Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 BeadChip analysis revealed a 0.45 Mb long deletion of the paternal allele of  2p16.1. FISH analysis confirmed the deletion in the patient but not in any of  her parents. The deleted region contains only 3 protein coding RefSeq ge  nes, BCLA11, PAPOLG and REL, and 1 long non coding RNA gene FLJ16341. Based on high phenotype similarity of our patient with 6 reported patients  showing the typical phenotype of the 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome  we propose that the critical region of the syndrome can be narrowed down and that these brain expressed genes can be considered candidates for the clinical symptoms. However, multiple deletions of variable length within  the interval between 2p14 and 2p16.1 have been described in patients with  intellectual disability but not necessarily the other typical symptoms of the syndrome and some of these deletions do not overlap.

316,392, Genetic study of PTEN mutations among individuals with ASDs / MR and macrocephaly,P02.213,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of severe neurodevelopmen tal conditions among which pervasive developmental disorder (not other   wise specified) and autistic disorder are the most common. The prevalence of ASDs is currently estimated at 60 and 13 per 10,000 for ASDs and autism, respectively. Autistic disorder is often associated with macrocephaly; 24%  of patients have head circumference (HC) at >98th centile. Mutations in the  PTEN gene have been reported in patients with ASDs and significant ma  crocephaly (HC ranging from +2.5 SD to +8 SD). Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis. Three novel (p.Asp331Thrfs*11,  p.Thr321Glnfs*23, p.Glu242*) and two known germline mutations  (p.Pro246Leu, p.Arg130*) have been found in 8 of the 53 probands (15%). We discuss possible genotype/phenotype correlation in our group of pati   ents. Our data support former findings that PTEN mutations are frequent  in patients with ASDs and macrocephaly.

Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism.

While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver  Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis   order 1 were identified.

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of  generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene  hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach  towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with  an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high  resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor   matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes  using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et  al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected:  deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1  (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du  plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83,  RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM   PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and  axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests  generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able  to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome  determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor   matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

We report a girl withautistic features carrying a balanced translocation t(5 7)(q14 q34). Fluo rescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis with chromosome 7q specificYAC clones showed that the chromosome 7 breakpoint is located betweenmarkers D7S684 and D7S661. The region coincides with the candidateregion for autism on chromosome 7 from previous linkage studies. A BACclone of 82 kb spanning the translocation breakpoint was identified  andthe breakpoint was mapped to 2 kb region within the BAC. Mutationscreening of the 2 genes closest to the breakpoint was performed in a setof 30 autistic patients. We found no sequence variant which predictsaminoacid alteration associated with the phenotype. Two polymorphicnucleotides were identified in one of the genes  and the significance of thepolymorphism in autism remains to be clarified. Study of the methylationpattern of the breakpoint region failed to find any difference betweenpatient with the translocation and normal individuals.

The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line.

40,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test  and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and  analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose.

95,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples.

Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy. Our findings support the hypothesis that somatic genome instability could affect as homeostasis of aneuploid neurons as functioning of the neu ronal network in the whole autistic brain, playing, therefore, an important role in the pathogenesis.

Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study. The  study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German). Twenty eight tagSNPs were selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. A significant association, that over   came the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and permutations was obtained with the marker rs7052177 (p, 6.13e 4). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible participation of PTCHD1 rare variants in ASD and  ID, we are currently performing a mutation screening in the Spanish ASD cohort, and in an additional sample of 200 individuals with ID.

Genetic and cytogenetic studies revealed that most of the chromosomes are associated with autism, abnormalities of  chromosomes 15 and X being most frequently documented. AIM OF THE STUDY: Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood samples from children with autism was performed to identify possible structural or nume rical chromosomal abnormalities by GTG banding. RESULTS: The study revealed normal karyotypes in most cases (47 out of  50 individuals).

Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists.

The use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown to have  a positive effect in treating some symptoms of autism. The effects of  these drugs vary in individuals due to the presence of S or L alleles  of 5 HTTLPR. Studies performed on various autistic populations have  found different allele frequencies for the L and S alleles.

95,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples.

Background: The genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates.Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort. The sample contains 161 families ascertained through one or more autistic probands with normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability. The study cohort contains 648 individuals: 227 probands, 324 parents, 97 unaffected siblings belonging to 161 families. All probands, unaffected siblings and parents are genotyped with high resolution Illumina OMNI 2.5 8v1 microarrays. For all individuals, an extensive list of phenotypic information is collected inclu   ding IQ, SRS scores, 3DI, clinical genetic examination and family history.Results:We present the results of a family based study on the validity of CNV de   tection in ASD using a high resolution platform. We study the segregation of known and novel rare CNVs with qualitative and quantitative autism phenotypes. Additionally association studies are performed with respect to amongst others gene content and parental origin.Conclusion:With this study we aim to contribute to the clinical validation of the current knowledge of ASD risk variants and to the identification of novel variants.

610,676, Diagnosis of intellectual disability by sequencing all genes known in pathology,P08.42,,"The etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) are very heterogeneous. For this reason, exome sequencing is increasingly used in the diagnosis of ID.We sequenced 151 index cases with the Illumina TruSight One panel which targets the coding sequences of 4813 genes involved in human pathology. Our aim was a diagnostic yield close to exome sequencing but less expensi ve. All patients had a negative diagnostic work up before sequencing inclu   ding chromosome microarray analysis.A definitive or likely diagnosis was found for 42 index cases (28%) in 39 different genes: 30 were autosomal dominant (de novo or with a low mo saicism in one parent), 6 were autosomal recessive, 6 were X linked. We also made 4 partial diagnoses which do not explain the whole phenotype. Besi  des, 10 variants were classified as variants of unknown significance. Finally, we identified 7 incidental findings irrelevant with the indication.In our series, 56 patients had autism and ID with normal motor develop ment and autistic regression. In these patients, we achieved a unique dia gnosis (1.7%); therefore our diagnostic yield was 42% among our 95 pati   ents with ID and no autism. We had also 35% diagnoses in our 40 patients with ID and epilepsy.Overall, this technique provides a significant advance in the diagnostic strat   egy of patients with ID. However, it highlights the need to better characterize its clinical indications.

Materials and methods: Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, using an Agi  lent 4x180K platform, was performed in 1200 patients with mental retarda tion, autism spectrum disorders and congenital anomalies. Results: In our cohort, we identified 6 cases with intragenic deletions in RB  FOX1, 4 of them with additional CNV in other chromosomes.

40,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs.

Numerous studies indicate that chromosomal and genomic imbalances play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism. However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain   the prime target of the disease   have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex  matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorders, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. Autistic spectrum disorders currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy. Our findings support the hypothesis that somatic genome instability could affect as homeostasis of aneuploid neurons as functioning of the neu ronal network in the whole autistic brain, playing, therefore, an important role in the pathogenesis.

426,765,Identification of a genomic homozygous deletion of ZNF277 in a child with SLI,P06.48,,"Specific language impairment (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental dis   order in which language abilities are below age expectations, in the absence  of explanatory environmental or medical conditions, such as hearing loss,  intellectual disability or autism. SLI affects 3 7% of English speaking pre  school children. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277   gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex   pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L   genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autistic spectrum dis   orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277  deletions. We observed  an increased frequency of ZNF277  deletions in probands with SLI (6/318,  1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen   dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277  in lymphoblastoid cell lines car  rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found  that, while ZNF277  microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do  not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi  crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 . Given these fin  dings, we postulate that ZNF277  microdeletions may contribute to the risk  of speech and language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risks previously described in this region.

Pa rental questionnaires regarding executive function and demographics were performed as well. Each subjectâs tests results were compared to each testâs norms as provided by the test authors. When available, Israeli norms were used for comparison.Results: Children born after PGD showed scores within the normal or above normal ranges for all developmental outcomes. The mean WPPSI Full Scale Intelligence Quotient and Verbal Intelligence Quotient were signi ficantly higher than the general population(P,0.013), although not clinically significant(100Â±15). All other tests performed within normal test ranges.Conclusions: This pilot study shows that children conceived after PGD dis   play normal developmental neuropsychological outcomes at age 4 5 years when compared to age matched normal children in the general population. A larger controlled study is needed to confirm the validity of this conclusi on.  G. Altarescu:  None. G.C. Sacks: None. J. Guedalia:  None. T. Gilboa:   None. E.J. Margalioth:  None. E.

446,2229,Microarray Comparative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients with autism or autistic spectrum disorders,J18.03,,"Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, Athens, Greece. Aim: Autism or autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are a lifelong neurode   velopmental disorder and Î± few cases of chromosomal abnormalities are  found by conventional cytogenetic techniques, while the microarray Compa  rative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) allows the identification of submicroscopic genomic rearrangements. This study describes the ap  plication of array CGH, as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients  with autism or ASD. Materials  Methods: During the last 4 years, 88/480 patients were studied with autism or ASD of unknown aetiology but with normal previous con ventional karyotype and other genetic tests. High resolution 4X180K and  1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro  bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar  dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51).

Copy number variants are frequent in autism spectrum disorders and gene ralized epilepsy. In this study, we performed comparative genomic hybridi   zation assay (aCGH) using Agilent Microarray Kit, 4x180K in a preselected sample of 36 Bulgarian patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID). The region most often engaged in copy number changes included 15q11.2 15q12. In 7 patients (19.4%) CNVs were located in 15q12. Five of them har bored microduplications in GABRG3 gene, 1 patient showed microduplica tion in GABRB3 gene and in 1 patient both rearrangements were present. Aberrations in 15q11.2 region were observed in 2 patients. One of them was a 0.161 Mb deletion, including SNURF/SNRPN upstream reading frame. In the other patient, a 2.608 Mb duplication covering 36 genes was revealed. Genomic region on 15q11 13 is involved in many clinically important re arrangements. These include aberrations of various sizes which can affect the neuronal differentiation by disrupting normal epigenetic control and gene expression. All Bulgarian patients with CNVs harboring 15q12 shared a common clinical phenotype of severe ID, speech impairment or complete lack of speech, different types of seizures, facial dysmorphisms, microcepha ly and behavior abnormalities of the autistic spectrum. In contrast, the two patients with 15q11.2 rearrangements displayed different clinical characte ristics and milder forms of mental retardation. Our results are in line with the central role of GABAergic systems in ID and epilepsy. Further studies are needed to investigate the parental origin and elucidate the effect of the CNVs and the phenotype genotype correlations.

618,709,Rubinstein Taybi syndrome type 2: Report of 9 new cases that extend the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum,P08.77,,"BACKGROUND: Rubinstein Taybi syndrome is an autosomal dominant  neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by growth deficiency, broad  thumbs and great toes, intellectual disability and characteristic craniofacial  appearance. Mutations in CREBBP account for around 55% of cases, with a further 8% attributed to the paralogous gene EP300. Comparatively few  reports exist describing the phenotype of Rubinstein Taybi due to EP300  mutations. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data were gathered from 9 pa tients from the UK and Ireland with pathogenic EP300 mutations, identified either by targeted testing or exome sequencing. RESULTS: All patients had  mild or moderate intellectual impairment. Behavioural or social difficul   ties were noted in eight, including three with autistic spectrum disorders.  Typical dysmorphic features of Rubinstein Taybi were only variably present.  Additional observations include maternal pre eclampsia (2/9), syndactyly  (3/9), delayed bone age (2/9), feeding or swallowing issues (2/9), scolio   sis (2/9) and hypermobility of the elbow (2/9). Six patients had truncating mutations in EP300, with pathogenic missense mutations identified in the remaining three. DISCUSSION: The findings support previous observations that microcephaly, maternal pre eclampsia, mild growth restriction and a mild to moderate intellectual disability are key pointers to the diagnosis of EP300 related Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Variability in the presence of typical facial features of Rubinstein Taybi further highlights clinical hetero geneity, particularly among patients identified by exome sequencing. Fea tures that overlap with Floating Harbor syndrome including craniofacial dysmorphism and delayed osseous maturation were observed in 3 patients.

He has various seizure types, andis treated with a combination of valproic acid, clobazam and ethusuximide with a relative improvement but partial con  trol. The child exhibited behavioral problems includingaggression and violence, with recurrent rage attacks. Levetiractam administration escalated the frequency of these behaviors signi ï¬cantly, and therefore was dis  continued. Metabolic workup was normal including: lactic, ammonia, blood amino acids, Carnitine, Acylcarnitine.

Additional clinical fea  tures include dysmorphic features, obesity, musculoskeletal disorders (hypotonia, hypermobility, kyphoscoliosis) andbehavioural problems (autistic spectrum disorders) and afebrile seizures. The underlying cause of the syndrome is constitutive variants in the DNMT3 gene. We present an 11  old boy with recognized Tatton Brown Rahman syndrome and con ï¬rmed variant in the DNMT3 gene. Materials and methods: During molecular diagnostic procedure analysis of FMR1 gene for FRAXA syndrome and panel of 264 genes correlated with autism and mental retardation (NGS) were performed. Results: ForFMR1 gene expansion of CGG repeats was not identi ï¬ed. NGS analysis allowed identi ï¬cation of known heterozygotic variant p.Pro904Leu (c.2711C>T) intheDNMT3A . This variant is reported in dbSNP database (rs149095705) and ClinVar Database as likely pathogenic. Molecular analysis of p.Pro904Leu was also performed forproband âs mother and sister were mutation was not identi ï¬ed. Unfortunately the father âs material was not available for genetic analysis. There is high probability ofde novo character of identi ï¬ed variant. Conclusions: In the case of patients with intellectual disability and obesity, Tatton Brown Rahman syndromeshould be considered in the differential diagnosis.

A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ï¬uence genetic risk. I.M.

610,676, Diagnosis of intellectual disability by sequencing all genes known in pathology,P08.42,,"The etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) are very heterogeneous. For this reason, exome sequencing is increasingly used in the diagnosis of ID.We sequenced 151 index cases with the Illumina TruSight One panel which targets the coding sequences of 4813 genes involved in human pathology. Our aim was a diagnostic yield close to exome sequencing but less expensi ve. All patients had a negative diagnostic work up before sequencing inclu   ding chromosome microarray analysis.A definitive or likely diagnosis was found for 42 index cases (28%) in 39 different genes: 30 were autosomal dominant (de novo or with a low mo saicism in one parent), 6 were autosomal recessive, 6 were X linked. We also made 4 partial diagnoses which do not explain the whole phenotype. Besi  des, 10 variants were classified as variants of unknown significance. Finally, we identified 7 incidental findings irrelevant with the indication.In our series, 56 patients had autism and ID with normal motor develop ment and autistic regression. In these patients, we achieved a unique dia gnosis (1.7%); therefore our diagnostic yield was 42% among our 95 pati   ents with ID and no autism. We had also 35% diagnoses in our 40 patients with ID and epilepsy.Overall, this technique provides a significant advance in the diagnostic strat   egy of patients with ID. However, it highlights the need to better characterize its clinical indications. Mostly, our experience suggests that ID as part of an autistic syndrome is currently not a good indication due to the supposed multifactorial nature of this pathology.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  165Back to index",2016,,"B.

374,446,"Smaller and larger deletions of the Williams Beuren syndrome region implicate genes involved in mild facial phenotype, epilepsy and autistic traits",P02.135,,"Williams Beuren syndrome is a multisystemic disorder caused by a hemizy   gous deletion of 1.5Mb on chromosome 7q11.23 spanning 28 genes. A few patients with larger and smaller WBS deletion have been reported. They  show clinical features that vary between isolated SVAS to the full spectrum  of WBS phenotype, associated with epilepsy or autism spectrum behavior.We describe four patients with atypical 7q11.23 deletions identified by mul   tiple ligation probe amplification analysis and fine mapping by quantitative real time PCR. Two carry an approximately 3.5 Mb larger deletion towards the telomere that includes HIP1  and YWHAG genes. Other two carry a shor   ter deletion of approximately 1.2 Mb at centromeric side that excludes the  distal WBS genes BAZ1B  and FZD9 , respectively. Along with previously reported cases, genotype phenotype correlation in  the patients described here further suggests that haploinsufficiency of HIP1   and YWHAG might cause the severe neurological and neuropsychological  deficits including epilepsy and autistic traits and that the preservation of BAZ1B  and FZD9  genes may be related to mild facial features and moderate  neuropsychological deficits. This report highlights the importance to cha racterize additional patients with 7q11.23 atypical deletions and to com pare neuropsychological and clinical features between individuals with lar  ger and smaller WBS deletion to shed light on the pathogenic role of genes  within and flanking the Williams Beuren syndrome region.

390,651,Study of a large Spanish cohort of 22q13 deletion syndromeÂ´s patients. A genotype phenotype correlation?,P05.070,,"Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the deletion or disruption of a 22q13 region containing the post synaptic protein gene SHANK3 . The clinical features of PMS (also known  as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and otherdevelopmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmor   phic features. Other less frequent features include seizures, brain, renal and cardiac malformations, motor deficits, and lymphedema Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, Clinical expression also varies widely, even among patients with small deletions, and no correlation between deletion size and phenotype has been found. A role for additional genetic factors, in addition to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, is likely. Because PMS is considered  to be underdiagnosed, the true prevalence is unknown. Aims. We aim to define a possible genotype phenotype comparison to use  high resolution deletion breakpoint mapping on a large cohort of patients, addressed the hypothesis that additional genes or regions of chromosome  22q13 besides SHANK3 may contribute to the PMS phenotype. Results. Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for more than 50  individuals in a patient cohort using a custom designed high resolution oli  gonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform, prompting  this genotype phenotype association study. Most of them have been studied by FISH, MLPA and array CGH and their clinical features have been defined.  Interestingly, a great genetic variability, with deletion sizes between 10 Kb  and as much as 9 MB was found.Conclusions.

Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent.

The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita  bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy   perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety  of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity.  Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as  sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi  leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with  different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits.

The aim was of this study was to evaluate social anxiety and autism in FMR1 premutation carriers and con trols using the Social Phobia Inventory and the Autism Spectrum Quotient.Material and Methods: Fifty nine premutation carriers (40 females; 19 ma les) (7 females and 9 males with FXTAS) were compared to 50 controls (32 females; 18 males).Results: Our results show that FMR1 premutation carriers have higher so   cial anxiety scores and autistic traits compared to controls. Indeed, the SPIN scores were higher increased in women FMR1 premutation carriers compa red to men whereas the AQ scores were similar between the two genders. Finally, SPIN scores were correlated with the repeat size when the CGG num ber was greater than 100.Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that social anxiety is greater in FMR1 premutation carrier women than in controls but not in men. In addi   tion, both men and women with the FMR1 premutation have an increased risk of autism traits.

640,815, MECP2 duplication: genetic and clinical study in Spanish patients,P09.097,,"Introduction: The MECP2 duplication syndrome (OMIM_300260) is a neu  rodevelopmental disorder X linked characterized by severe to profound intellectual disability, early infantile hypotonia, autistic traits, seizures and recurrent respiratory infections. It usually affects boys, but also there are girls affected. Duplication could be de novo or inherited from asymptomatic carrier mother. It has been reported about 120 cases all over the world, wi thout a known incidence.The aim of the study is to characterize a Spanish cohort with MECP2 dupli cation syndrome to improve our knowledge of the disease and perform a genotype phenotype correlation.Material and Method: The cohort consists in 13 patients of both sexes dia gnosed in different Spanish hospitals. The duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array. The clinical characterization was carried out using a checklist designed for the project. The molecular characterization is di vided into several steps: 1) Checking the duplication by qPCR doses, stu dy XCI and FISH; 2) If FISH shows tandem duplication, we narrowed the breakpoints through qPCR, PCR long and Sanger sequencing; 3) Analyze the expression of the two MeCP2 isoforms by RT qPCR.Results: In this collaborative study has been characterized a heterogeneous cohort, with both sexes, with different phenotypes (Rett like and duplicati   on patients) and inherited or de novo duplication located in different regi ons (tandem, other region of ChrX or ChrY). However, this information is not enough to create a clear genotype phenotype correlation.Conclusions: We suppose MECP2 duplication syndrome is an underdia gnosed disease that needs further characterization studies in order to give a better genetic and clinical diagnosis.",2016,,"L.

650,1260, A comprehensive genome analysis of three constitutional chromothripsis rearrangements: a new mechanism for complex karyotype disorders,P13.12,,"Chromothripsis is a novel phenomenon in the structural variation lands  cape of cancer genomes. We analyzed the genomes of three patients with  congenital disease without apparent karyotype anomalies. The rearran  gements displayed unanticipated complexity resembling chromothripsis.  The array CGH analysis identified complex chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 (Case 1), 12 (Case 2) and 1 and 4 (Case 3). Case 1 presented a complex clinical phenotype in which coexisted 3 known dis   orders: Potocki Lupski syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease and neu rofibromatosis type 1. Case 2 showed intellectual disabilities with autistic  traits and a particular stromal corneal dystrophy, at the moment described  only in adult subjects. Case 3 exhibited a complex clinical picture, not im mediately framed with 1p36 deletion syndrome (array CGH revealed a 3  Mb deletion in 1p36). With whole genome sequencing we investigated the  genetic architecture of these constitutional complex chromosomal rearran  gements (CCRs),copy number profiling, and breakpoint junctions proving  that the rearrangements (deletions/duplications/inversions) identified in our cases were not clustered on a single chromosome region, but on the  whole length of the chromosomes.

689,237, A novel KDM6B gene de novo mutation in two siblings with a variable neurocognitive phenotype,P08.29,,"Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Praha 5   Motol, Czech Republic Introduction: The clinical  and genetic heterogeneity of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) poses a signi ï¬cant diagnostic challenge. Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ï¬rst line diag  nostic  and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22  and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con  ï¬rmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme  thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ï¬ed a thirdâmutation âinKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ï¬ndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

721,182, Novel WAC frameshift variant in a boy with DeSanto Shinawi syndrome revealed using whole exome sequencing,P08.33,,"1Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Charles University 2nd Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic,2Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Diagnostic and Research Unit for RareDiseases, Charles University 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic DeSanto Shinawi syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the WAC gene. It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep  set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC  related phenotype and its developmental tra  jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype  ï¬rst approach.

Rappold1 1Department of Human Molecular Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,2Institute of Physiology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany,3Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but these symptoms are often overlooked and it is still not clear how GI dysfunction relates to the core features of ASD.FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectualdisability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano  metry. Several Foxp1 targets previously identi ï¬ed by microarray analysis in the brain were signi ï¬cantly deregu  lated in the oesophagus of Foxp1 +/  mice. The total gut transit was signi ï¬cantly prolonged. Spatiotemporal maps depicting the colonic contraction patterns revealed strongly disturbed contractility and peristalsis. Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism spectrum disorder may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1  dependent deregulation of genes.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT  qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail  able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers.Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange  ment.

813,255, Neurodevelopmental disorders and chromatin remodel ing dysregulation: the lessons from Kabuki syndromespectrum and clinical presentation of Tunisian cases,P11.056,,"Kaabi, W. Ltaif, S. Aloulou, S. Mallek, S. Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ï¬lled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen  tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ï¬nally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ï¬ve cardinal manifestations of KB deï¬ned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ï¬nitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ï¬rmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N.B. Abdelmoula: B.

We present data relating to a child investigated for global developmental delay, intellectual disability, malformations of the heart and great vessels, autistic traits, and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder. The whole exome sequencing test identi ï¬ed in the CDK13 gene a heterozygous variant p. (Asp855Glu). To our knowledge, this variant is not reported before, and it is absent in the general population in the control databases. In silico analysis, predict adeleterious effect of this variant. Based on the ACMG guidelines,this variant is classi ï¬ed as a likely pathogenic variant. There are no variants identi ï¬ed in other genes in this child; this gene can most likely explain this child âs phenotype. To our knowledge, there are a few cases reported with a mutation in cdk13 with the same clinicalfeature. References:1 Greifenberg, A. K., D. HÃ¶nig, K. Pilarova, R. DÃ¼ster, K.

During development, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are born in the nasal placode and migrate to the hypothalamus, where they position to regulate sexual reproduc tion. Defective GnRH neuron development may lead to GnRH deï¬ciency (GD) which is characterized by absent or delayed puberty. Several GD causative genes have been identi ï¬ed so far, but half of the cases are still idiopathic. The employment ofcomplementary research approaches may be useful to identify additional genes implicated in GD pathogenesis. Here we combined for the ï¬rst time in the ï¬eld the transcriptomic analysis of GnRH neurons with exome sequencing data from GD patientsto identify novel candidate genes. As a proof of principle, we identi ï¬ed a pathogenic variant in the autism linked Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3 ) gene in a patient with severe delayed puberty and autistic traits. We demonstrated that NLGN3 is enriched in GnRH neurons at late developmental stages. Further we found that NLGN3 overexpression in an immature model of immortalizedGnRH neurons promoted neurite extension whereas the novelNLGN3 mutation formed a truncated protein, thus supporting its pathogenic potential. Overall, our results highlighted how the combination of gene expression and exome sequencing data is areliable approach to identify novel candidate gene for GD such aNLGN3, an autism linked gene that we found for the ï¬rst time associated to GD.",2021,,R.

Pirogov, Separated Structural Unit Ã¢ÂÂClinical Research Institute of PediatricsÃ¢ÂÂ, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation,  3Moscow City University of Psychology and Education, Moscow, Russian Federation, 4Department of Medical Genetics, Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate  Education, Ministry of Health, Moscow, Russian Federation, 5The State Educational  Institution of Professional Training under the Federal Agency of Health Care and Social  Development, Moscow, Russian Federation. Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of  generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene  hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach  towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with  an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high  resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor   matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes  using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et  al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected:  deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1  (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du  plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83,  RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM   PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and  axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests  generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able  to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome  determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor   matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

Regular chromosome analysis resulted in thirteen colonies  showing a normal female karyotype and a single isolated metaphase  with 47,XX,+18. After extensive work up according to international pre   natal quality standards, no other colony  with trisomy 18 was found in a  total of 29 colonies. Therefore, the  finding of a single Ã¢ÂÂ47,XX,+18Ã¢ÂÂ cell  was considered to represent a pseudomosaicism and the foetus was  diagnosed with a normal female karyotype. Fifteen years later and at the age of 14, the very same girl was re   ferred to our department because of mental retardation and autistiform  behaviour. After exclusion of a (pre)mutation for Fragile X syndrome,  oligo array CGH analysis was performed, using the Agilent 105 K Ox   ford array (custom design ID: 019015), in search for a previously un   detected (sub)microscopic genomic imbalance. To our surprise, a slightly elevated ratio was found for all (2424) oligo  probes on chromosome 18, suggestive for a mosaic pattern of trisomy  18. No further genomic aberrations were detected. Subsequent FISH  analysis on interphase and metaphase cells of blood and other tissue   samples from the patient confirmed the presence of a mosaic pattern  for trisomy 18.

Moreover, the male:female ratio in multiplex families was 2 .8:1 (37 males:13 females), which appears to be lower than the typical male:female ratio of 4:1 .

Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study. The  study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German).

245,1432,Molecular genetic testing of mental retardation in  Bulgaria,P12.128,,"Mental retardation is highly heterogeneous in clinical and genetic point  of view. Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.  Most probably this is due to the characteristics of this group, being  clinically mixed and containing some definite autistic cases.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.  Conclusion: The Arg468His mutation is the most prevalent (6/14 fami   lies) mutation in MFN2 causing CMT2A in Spanish patients and our  study confirmed that it is actually pathological, presenting as a neu   ropathy in a mild to moderate degree.",2010,,"T.

Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism. Identifiable endophenotypes and reliable biomarkers within ASDs would help to focus molecular research and uncover genetic causes and deve lopmental mechanisms.  D. Avdjieva Tzavella: None. S.

The use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown to have  a positive effect in treating some symptoms of autism. The effects of  these drugs vary in individuals due to the presence of S or L alleles  of 5 HTTLPR.

479,778, S Three SNP haplotypes in Neuroligins may correlate to autism susceptibility,P09.021,,"Chemistry  and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

The prevalence of ASDs is currently estimated at 60 and 13 per 10,000 for ASDs and autism, respectively. Autistic disorder is often associated with macrocephaly; 24%  of patients have head circumference (HC) at >98th centile. Mutations in the  PTEN gene have been reported in patients with ASDs and significant ma  crocephaly (HC ranging from +2.5 SD to +8 SD). Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis.

Numerous studies indicate that chromosomal and genomic imbalances play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism. However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain   the prime target of the disease   have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex  matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorders, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. Autistic spectrum disorders currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy. Our findings support the hypothesis that somatic genome instability could affect as homeostasis of aneuploid neurons as functioning of the neu ronal network in the whole autistic brain, playing, therefore, an important role in the pathogenesis.

We present a 4 year old girl with mo  tor and speech delay, mild ataxia, and behavioral problems including im  pulsivity, aggression and mild autistic features. She showed facial dysmor   phism, including a short nose with anteverted nares, downturned corners  of the mouth, and a full lower lip, reminiscent of patients with WBS. Array  CGH analysis revealed an intragenic 14 23kb deletion in the distal region 7q11.23, which leads to loss of exons 5 to 8 of HIP1. The deletion detected  in this patient overlaps with a recurrent distal deletion in 7q11.23 in the  patients reported by Ramocki et al. (2010). Those patients had similar cli nical features, including intellectual disabilities, neurobehavioral problems and in addition epilepsy. However, no information about facial dysmorphism  was reported.

The use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown to have  a positive effect in treating some symptoms of autism. The effects of  these drugs vary in individuals due to the presence of S or L alleles  of 5 HTTLPR. Studies performed on various autistic populations have  found different allele frequencies for the L and S alleles. In the present  study, allelic frequencies and genotypes of 110 South African (SA) au   tistic individuals (21 African, 48 Mixed and 41 Caucasian) were deter   mined and compared with the matching SA ethnic control populations.

Chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) has offered a high detection rate of small and large CNVs associated with ASD, and ledto discovery of new autism genes. We report on the results of chromosomal CMA investigation in a group of ASDs patients. Eighty patients were referred to our laboratory forgenetic testing with ASDs as part of a broad phenotype including ID or other clinical features. A complete clinical evaluation was performed with focus on psychiatric exam ination and psychological evaluation with speci ï¬c ASDs tests (ADOS, ADI R). Array CGH completed with kar  yotyping, FISH and qPCR tests were performed. A total of21 pathological CNVs (14 deletions and 7 duplications), with a median length of 3.7 Mb were detected in 17 patients. The involved genomic regions overlap 550 OMIMgenes. Besides well described syndromic regions associated with ASDs (e.g. deletions of 1q21.1, 22q13.3, 22q11.2, MBD5; Xq28 duplication), other genomic regions, rarelyreported in patients with ASDs were identi ï¬ed (deletion of 8p11.2p21.2, 9q34.1, 9p13, duplication of 7p22.2p22.1 , CHRNA7) ; thus having the potential to reveal new ASD genes.

133,440,Frequency of mosaic aneuploidy in children with  idiopathic autism,P0303.,,"It has been repeatedly suggested that numerous human diseases in   cluding major psychiatric disorders could be associated with mosaic  aneuploidy. Here, we have attempted to test this hypothesis concern   ing autism, a common childhood psychiatric disorder. About 5 10% of  autism cases are known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities  or gene mutations. However, mosaic aneuploidy in autism has not ever  been studied. We surveyed stochastic aneuploidy in children with/with   out idiopathic autism by interphase multiprobe fluorescence in situ hy   bridization (mFISH). The rate of chromosome loss and gain involving  six arbitrarily selected autosomes (chromosomes 1, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18)  and sex chromosomes was assessed in peripheral blood cells of 60  unaffected male children and 116 male children with idiopathic autism.

However, the frequency  of mosaic aneuploidy over the background level was found in 19 (16%) of 116 children  with idiopathic autism, while outlier values were not found in controls.

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis.

332,530, Clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with de novo 0.45 Mb deletion of 2p16.1,P03.102,,"The widespread use of microarray methods has contributed to the identi fication of several new rare microdeletion syndromes including that asso   ciated with deletions of 2p15 p16.1. The 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndro me is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, microcephaly, growth retardation, facial abnormalities, disturbed vision and other symptoms. We report here an 11 year old autistic girl showing clinical features consistent with the syndrome. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of the patient showed a normal female karyotype. Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 BeadChip analysis revealed a 0.45 Mb long deletion of the paternal allele of  2p16.1. FISH analysis confirmed the deletion in the patient but not in any of  her parents.

Based on high phenotype similarity of our patient with 6 reported patients  showing the typical phenotype of the 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome  we propose that the critical region of the syndrome can be narrowed down and that these brain expressed genes can be considered candidates for the clinical symptoms. However, multiple deletions of variable length within  the interval between 2p14 and 2p16.1 have been described in patients with  intellectual disability but not necessarily the other typical symptoms of the syndrome and some of these deletions do not overlap.

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of  generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene  hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach  towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with  an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high  resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor   matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes  using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et  al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected:  deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1  (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du  plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83,  RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM   PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and  axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests  generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able  to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome  determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor   matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

Cytogenetic abnormalities have been detected in 5 10% of the patients with autism. Conventional karyotype analysis has revealed that chromosomal structural aberrations such as  translocation, inversion, deletion, and duplication play a role in causing autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Unfortunately, there is not a single specific biological marker clearly responsible from autism.

540,573, A very common inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis about which little is known,PS06.05,,"Introduction: TMLHE deficiency is a very common inborn error of carnitine  biosynthesis. The gene is X linked, and about 1 in 350 healthy males of Eu ropean descent have a deletion of exon 2 resulting in inability to synthesize carnitine. TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene  trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed.Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE  deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression.Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males  undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE  case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism.Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples. A case study suggests that carnitine supplementation may be useful in treating regressive autism episodes in patients with TMLHE  deficiency. It is unknown if infant males with TMLHE deficiency should re  ceive any dietary modification. It is unknown if there are genetic, dietary, or microbiome factors that influence the development of autism in TMLHE  deficient males.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.ESHG.ORG 131Back to inde x",2015,,"A.

Background :AARS2 is a nuclear gene encoding the mitochondrial enzyme alanyl tRNA synthetase. Bi allelic mutations in AARS2 are known causes of early onset cardiomyopathy or late onset leuko dystrophy. Until very recently, the p.Arg592Trp variant, either in thehomozygous or compound heterozygous state, has been exclusively and repeatedly described in infants with severe cardiomyopathy or primary pulmonary hypoplasia, both resulting in death before theage of 1 year. Nielsen et al. (2020) however reported one girl who developed dilated cardiomyopathy in her teens. Case report : We report on a 6 year old boy who was referred for genetic evaluation because of global developmental delay anda severe autism spectrum disorder. Pregnancy and perinatal course were uneventful. Besides gastro oesophageal re ï¬ux there were no general health problems. Exome sequencing revealed thehomozygous presence of the pathogenic variant c.1774C>T (p.Arg592Trp) in AARS2 . Both healthy parents, who denied con sanguinity, were heterozygous carriers. MRI of the brain did not show structural abnormalities or signs of leukodystrophy. AnAbstracts from the 54thEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference 559 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:88 â 608echocardiogram revealed a borderline thickness of the left ventricular wall (z score: 2.4). Ophthalmologic examination was completely normal. Conclusion: We con ï¬rm the recent clinical letter by Nielsen et al. reporting that the p.Arg592Trp variant is not always resulting infatal infantile onset cardiomyopathy. At the age of 6 years, our proband only presented with neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits which are occasionally retrospectively found in patients with late onsetleukodystrophy due to bi allelic pathogenic variants in AARS2 .

95,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples.

We selec ted high confidence CNVs (detected by 3 algorithms) not overlapping more than 20% with CNVs in 8000 controls.We identified 165 CNVs in 132 individuals, 78% with only one CNV. CNVs ranged from 5 kb to 3 Mb, and 67% were deletions. However, genic CNVs, which represented 53% of all CNVs, were more frequently duplications (65%). Genic CNVs integrated between 1 and 17 genes, and included genes implicated in ASD etiology like NRXN1 and CHD2, as well as novel genes.  CNVs were mainly inherited, with only 10% de novo. We further evaluated the presence of autistic traits in parents, using appro priate questionnaires, and the type of inheritance of the CNV (inherited vs  de novo). We observed a significant excess of autistic traits in the fathers  that transmitted CNVs, mainly for the âaloofâ personality, defined as lak   king interest in social interaction. Analysis of familial correlation data from  parents and probands showed a significant correlation between parents. We  therefore show evidence for an excess of subthreshold autistic traits in CNV transmitting parents of children with ASD, particularly for paternal trans mission. We also observed a tendency for assortative mating in families of  affected individuals, in particular for inherited CNVs. We conclude that a large fraction of CNVs are inherited and correlate with autistic traits in parents in the studied sample.  I.C. ConceiÃ§Ã£o: None. C. Correia: None. B. Oliveira: None. M.M.

824,126, Autism Comorbidities: Role of CHD8 during the Development of the Enteric Nervous System,C12.4,,"IGBMC, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France Introduction: CHD8 is mutated in 0.21% of total autism spectrum disorders (ASD) cases. Recently, clinical reas  sessment highlighted the high prevalence of gastrointestinal(GI) defects in ASD. Transient suppression of chd8 in zebra ï¬sh led to a reduced number of enteric neurons and a decreased gut mobility which likely drive the GI problems(Bernier et al. Cell, 2014). Materials and Methods: To understand how the loss of chd8 causes the loss of mature enteric neurons, we generated and characterized a stable mutant zebra ï¬sh line: Tg(chd8 sa19827;phox2bb:GFP ) in which the neuronal pro  genitors (i.e. enteric neural crest cells, eNCCs) are labeledwith GFP. Results: First, we observed a migration delay and reduced proliferation of eNCCs during early developmentand a decreased number of mature neurons and more speciï¬cally serotonergic neurons at 5 days post fertilization. Second, transcriptomic analyses of eNCCs revealed theupregulation of the serotonin receptor htr6 and the dysregulation of several actors of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity and RhoA pathways, extracellular matrix compo nents, and several genes from the human morbid genome. Third, behavioral analyses showed i) hyperactivity of the mutant chd8 larvae and ii) normal sociability and no aggressive behavior in the adult mutants. Conclusion: We showed that the decreased number of enteric neurons in absence of chd8 is due to a combination of proliferation, migration and differentiation defects of the eNCCs. Moreover, our transcriptomic data identi ï¬ed druggable targets in chd8  associated signaling pathwaysand we are currently performing rescue experiments with small molecules in the chd8 mutants.

Numerous studies indicate that chromosomal and genomic imbalances play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism. However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain   the prime target of the disease   have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex  matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorders, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. Autistic spectrum disorders currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy.

37,23,The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families. Four regions of linkage were identifi ed  including chromosome 2q (MLS 3.74), 7q (MLS 3.20), 16p (MLS  2.93) and 17q (MLS 2.34), three of which have been replicated by  other groups. Candidate gene and association studies are now in  progress in order to isolate the susceptibility genes at these loci.  On chromosome 7q31, the FOXP2 gene is mutated in a severe  monogenic form of speech and language impairment and encodes a  transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead  domain.

95,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples. Two patients have a paternally  inherited microduplication between the genes GABRA5 and GABRG3 whereas other two patients have a maternally inherited duplication within the D15S1021 marker. All the other duplications are the novo microrearrangements.

In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes. The possibility of developing spe   cific alterations of Cowden disease during the second decade should  be considered.

148,259,cADHERiN 11 as a possible candidate gene for autism,P01.247,,"Child Psychiatry, Leuven,  Belgium, 3University Center for Child and Youth Psychiatry, Antwerp, Belgium. Background: Positional cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in autism  patients is a valuable strategy towards the identification of candidate  genes, especially in isolated autism, and when the aberration is de novo and family history is negative for autism . (1) Objectives:  We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ  of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods:  1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro   scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON   SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat   ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the  AK13094  gene, another was near GFOD  and RANBP10  . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11   gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11  is expressed in  the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses . (2) Interestingly, there is evidence that  altered synaptogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism .  For instance, the cell adhesion molecules NLGN 3  and  4 are impli   cated in autism through their role in the establishment of functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons .

The clinical phe   notype associated with the reciprocal duplication however is not well  defined, though speech delay is often mentioned. We present 14 new  7q11.23 cases with the reciprocal duplication of the Williams Beuren  syndrome critical region, 9 familial and 5 de novo . These were iden   tified by either array based MLPA or by array CGH/oligonucleotide  analysis in a series of patients with idiopathic mental retardation with  an estimated population frequency of 1:13.000 1:20.000. Interchromo   somal recombination is the preferred exchange mechanism by which  the duplication arises. The CYLN2  gene within the duplicated region  is approximately 2 times overexpressed in carriers of the duplication.  The expression of the GTF2I  gene, just on the boundary of the dupli   cated region and thus with only 2 intact copies present in patients, was  also significantly increased. Variable speech delay is a constant finding in our patient group, con   firming previous reports. Cognitive abilities range from normal to mod   erate mental retardation. The association with autism is present in five  patients and in one father who also carries the duplication. There is  an increased incidence of hypotonia and congenital anomalies: heart  defects (PDA), diaphragmatic hernia, cryptorchidism and non spe   cific brain abnormalities on MRI. Specific dysmorphic features were  noted in our patients, including a short philtrum, thin lips and straight  eyebrows.

246,1501,A 134 kb duplication 0.5 mb upstream of sOX9  associated with hermaphroditism in an XX male and autism in  his XY brother,P12.200,,"In a sibship of six a 46,XX male hermaphrodite with ovotestes and no  detectable SRY sequence had a brother with infantile autism without  mental retardation. Both brothers had inherited an identical 134 Kb  duplication of the regulatory genomic region 0.5 Mb upstream of SOX9  from their mother. In another brother who had inherited the same ma   ternal SOX9 haplotype, no upstream duplication was found, proving  that the mother was a gonadal mosaic for the duplication. We hypoth   esize that the duplication caused sufficient SRY independent SOX9  expression in the undifferentiated fetal gonads to promote testicular  development. Apparently, this effect was tissue  and/or fetal specific as  no SOX9 expression was detectable in leukocytes and skin fibroblasts  from any of the siblings. The observations in the family also suggest  that such a SOX9 regulatory region duplication may predispose for  autism in the presence of a Y chromosome, i.e. a SRY gene. This hy   pothesis is supported by the SOX9 segregation pattern which as a less  than 8,2 % probability of being a random event, and the unexplained  general excess of autistic features in males. We therefore propose that  an additional role of SOX9, directly linked to testicular differentiation,  could be the promotion of male specific brain development. Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders ",2010,,"A.

Array CGH is a molecular karyotyping method remarkable with fast analysis and highly sensitive diagnostic value.We aimed to use this technology to screen autistic patientÃ¢ÂÂs whole genome in order to investigate new dchromosomal abberations. m A t ER i AL AND  m E t HOD: We isolated DNA samples of 35 primary autism patients between 0 18  years(median age:8.5).DNA samples which labelled according to the protocol, were hybridized with CytoSure Syndrome Plus(v2) 4x44K (Oxford Gene Technology, Oxford, UK) microchips and scanned with Agilent Microarray Scanner( Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA ). Obtained data were analyzed using Cytosure Analysis Software v.2.0.8 software(Oxford Gene Technology, Oxford, UK).RE s UL ts : We found 16p13.11 deletion in thirteen patients, 16p11.2 deletion in twelve patients, 1q21 deletion in ten patients, 2q21.1 deletion in eight patients, 2p21 deletion in seven patients, 8p23.1 deletions in seven patients. c ON c LU si ON: Accordig to these data, we can postulate that 16p13.11 region  and related genes also represent a predisposition to autism in our patients.

285,1114, a c GH analysis of two families showing both autism and epilepsy,P09.033,,"Autism is a genetic disorder, with an estimated heritability greater than  90%. Over the past years, the convergence of genomic technologies has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci by means of linkage studies. Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. We analysed two families showing both autism and epilepsy. The first one is the family of a woman, showing a severe and progressive epileptic disorder, who is married with an healthy man and has six children: two girls are healthy, a girl and two boys are affected by autism, while a boy showed partial seizures only twice. The three children with autism show a moderate mental retardation and an EEG with no epileptic alterations. The second family is composed by an epileptic woman married with a healthy man and their child affected by autism.The genetic basis of autism and epilepsy were studied in these  families. In particular, we performed an array CGH analysis to search for pathological CNVs which are common to all affected members of the two families.The study detected a single common region on chromosome 15q11.2, which has already been reported to be either deleted or duplicated in about 1% of epileptic patients. Moreover, the same region was associated with ASDs (autism spectrum disorders).

This new methodologies have led to identification of novel genomic disorder in patients with developmental delay/mental retardation and/or multiple congenital anomalies (DD/MR/MCA), with a significant increase in diagnostic yield .In this study we present the result of array CGH obtained in 150 children with normal karyotype but DD/MR/MCA. The array CGH 60K from agilent platform was performed.In 34 patients (22,66%) was detected a chromosomal deletion or duplicati   on previously described like pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs),. In 15 cases (10%) was necessary the analysis of parental samples, showing that 6 anomalies (40%) had occurred de novo and was classified as pathogenic and in 9 cases (60%) appeared to be inherited from an unaffected parent. In a total of 40 patients (26,66%) was possible to detect a pathogenic CNVs .Recent studies suggest that when aCGH is performed with an apparently normal karyotype, the diagnostic yield increases by an additional 8 17%. In our study we have obtained a 26,66% of children with pathogenic CNVs that is higher than the results obtained by other authors.

Autism is noticeably reported to be affected by mitochondrial dysfunction which impairs energy metabolism. mtDNA encodes 22 tRNAs working as amino acid transporters for synthesis of the respiratory chain enzymes. In volvement of mutations within tRNA genes have been well documented in mitochondrial disorders. In this study, tRNA Pro and tRNAThr were investigated  to find mutations which are related to autism pathogenesis, as these two genes mutations have been reported to be involved in some neurological disorders.Methods: In this study, a cohort of 24 unrelated idiopathic patients and 100 ethnically matched Persian control individuals were obtained. PCR sequen   cing of mtDNA fragments was employed to investigate the involvement of mitochondrial variations in autism.Results: A substitution , G15928A, was identified in two groups without a significant difference (P , 0.179, P> 0.05). A new homoplasmic substitusion, A15973G, was identified within the T loop of tRNA Pro gene in 1 patient as  it had not been reported before. This variation is moderatelyly conserved (75 %) among species and also, was not detected in blood sample from the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother.Conclusion: Investigation on mitochondrial varations may strengthen the role of genetics in association with autism.

Recently, copy number variants (CNVâs) have been shown to contribute to over 10% of ASD cases. Many of the known genes whose mutations cause ASD, have functions related to epigenetic regulation. We have applied a custom designed oligo array CGH with an exonic overlapping coverage of 450 genes known to cause autism or intellectual disability and autism candidate genes related to epigenetic machinery.Material and methods: Custom oligonucleotide arrays (formats 4x44 and 8x60) were designed with e Array Agilent technology. The final array design contains: 36,000 exonic probes for 450 genes considered of high priority (mean distance between probes 25bp), 2,000 probes for regulatory ele ments and microRNAâs and 22,000 whole genome probes (backbone).Results: We have studied a series of 139 patients including syndromic au   tism and/or familial cases of idiopathic autism. We have found 24 cases with pathological CNVâs. Most are non recurrent CNV, what allow us to propose new candidate genes involved in autism.Discussion: Our results confirm the importance of three regions in autism: Xq28 (MECP2), 22q13 (SHANK3) and 16q13, while all others regions are extremely heterogeneous.

Most individuals  have moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic like beha viour and decreased pain perception. Frequency of the syndrome is equal in males and females while incidence is still unknown. Beside the simple de   letion, loss of 22q13.3 can also result from translocation, ring chromosome formation and other less common structural changes affecting the region containing SHANK3 gene on long arm of chromosome 22. The most features  of the syndrome thought to be the consequence of loss that specific gene. We present a case of female newborn with Phelan McDermid syndrome. The child was born on term, from first, uncomplicated pregnancy with un  remarkable family history. She was initially treated in NICU because of early  neonatal infection. Because of congenital hypotonia with mild facial dysmor   phic features genetic analysis were performed. The karyotype revealed ring  chromosome (22): 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13.3).

In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups.

Aim: Autism or autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are a lifelong neurode   velopmental disorder and Î± few cases of chromosomal abnormalities are  found by conventional cytogenetic techniques, while the microarray Compa  rative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) allows the identification of submicroscopic genomic rearrangements. This study describes the ap  plication of array CGH, as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients  with autism or ASD. Materials  Methods: During the last 4 years, 88/480 patients were studied with autism or ASD of unknown aetiology but with normal previous con ventional karyotype and other genetic tests. High resolution 4X180K and  1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro  bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar  dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51). CNVs  detected were in loci at high risk for autism: 2q37.2, 2p16.3, 5p15.32p14.3,  7p22.3, 10q26.3, 12q24.22q24.3, 15q11.2q11.3, 16p11.2, 18q22.3q23, 21q22.3, Î§q21.31.

472,739," M Analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and Rett like features",P08.62,,"Background: Rett syndrome is a severe X linked dominant neurodevelop mental disorder primarily caused by de novo MECP2 mutations. Clinical features include developmental regression at the age of 6 18 months, ac quired microcephaly, autistic behavior, loss or severe impairment of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, gait apraxia, and seizures. CDKL5 mutations have been identified in early onset seizure vari ant and FOXG1 mutations in congenital variant of Rett syndrome. We report the results of mutation analysis of these genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features. Materials and  methods: MECP2 was analyzed in 416 patients, CDKL5 was analyzed in 59 patients, and FOXG1 was analyzed in 20 patients. MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions and duplications were analyzed by MLPA analysis (MRC Holland). Results: Pathogenic mutations  in the MECP2 gene in were identified in 45 patients with classic Rett syn drome, 7 patients with atypical Rett syndrome, 11 patients with Rett like features, and 1 patient with autism. CDKL5 mutations were found in 2 pati   ents with early onset seizures and Rett like phenotype. No FOXG1 mutation was detected in this study. Conclusions:  MECP2 mutations are common in  classic Rett syndrome patients, but they are less frequent in atypical or Rett like phenotypes. However, analysis of MECP2 in these patients should not be discouraged. More patients should be examined to determine frequencies of CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations in Czech Republic.

484,792, S No evidence for a contribution of CHRNA7 rare variants in autism susceptibility,P09.035,,"Recurrent microdeletions of chromosome 15q13.3 are causally associated with a wide range of phenotypic features, including autism spectrum disor   der (ASD), seizures, intellectual disability, and other psychiatric conditions. The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain.Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi   dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion.In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription. In conclusion, rare sequence variants in CHRNA7 do not significantly contribute to ASD susceptibility, at least in our clinical sample characterized by low frequency of associated medical comorbidity.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects.We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con   tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase.This innovative strategy to collect information on natural history and co morbidities of rare monogenic forms of ID/autism will promote familiesÃ¢ÂÂ empowerment and hopefully impact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ care.

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of  generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene  hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach  towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with  an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high  resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor   matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes  using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et  al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected:  deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1  (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du  plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83,  RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM   PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and  axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests  generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able  to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome  determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor   matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

A de novo loss of function missense  PUF60  mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked  coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60  and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced  different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome.We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip.

The  patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome.

Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3  concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo  derate to profound ID. SHANK3  haploinsufficiency is frequently associated  with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs  to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing  of this gene.Materials and Methods: Here we report on 2 boys with ASD and ID and a girl  with severe ID associated with a SHANK3  mutation found by next generation  sequencing (NGS) study (Illumina). Results: Two of these mutations are truncated and de novo involving the  exon 21 in the prolin rich domain (NM_001080420.1:c.2955_2970dup  (p.(Pro992Arg*325) and NM_001080420.1:c.4381C>T (p.(Gln1461*)). The  third is a 3 bases deletion variant NM_001080420.1:c.5090_5092delACC (p.(His1697del)) involving the exon 22 in the SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) do   main involved in multimerization of SHANK3 protein. Conclusion: The retrospective clinical examination of these patients did not  permit to distinct specific signs, which highlights the phenotypic hetero  geneity of these patients. Given the scarcity of variants involving SHANK3 ,  the unsystematic presence of the distinctive clinical features of Phelan Mc  Dermid Syndrome, a NGS approach by panel or exome seems more justified  than a targeted sequencing approach of SHANK3  in this phenotype.",2016,,"A.

In a recent stu dy, a K Cl cotransporter protein, KCC2 gene SLC12A5 on chromosome 20,  which previously was linked to idiopathic generalized epilepsy, familial fe  brile seizures and schizophrenia, was reported to be associated with func tionally impairing variants in autism spectrum disorders. Here, we report a  novel association of a polymorhism, rs9074, located in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR region of  SLC12A5 with autistic like traits in a healthy population.A total of 75 healthy volunteers aged between 18 30 participated to the study. Autistic like traits were quantitized on the autism spectrum quotient  (AQ) scale. AQ scores measured for each individual were comprised of five  subscales of social skills, attention switching, communication, attention to details and imagination categories utilizing a previously validated version  of the AQ in Turkish. SNP genotyping assays were performed with specific  primers and probes in an RT PCR platform.rs9074 genotypes were distributed as GG:48%, GA:41.3%, AA:10.7% with  allele frequencies in HWE. Total AQ (p,0.008), social skills (p,0.002) and at   tention switching (p,0.038) subscale scores were significantly higher in AA  bearers compared to GG+GA genotypes (Mann Whitney U test). AQ scores  were normally distributed. A significant association between AA genotype  and social skills scores (p,0.014) in subjects +0.5 SD above average for total AQ (normally distributed) were also noted (FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test).These results suggest a possible role of KCC2 in neurodevelopmental stages  in liaison with autism spectrum disorders.

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

The deletion occurs near the end of the chromosome at a location designated q13.3.In addition to normal growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological de ï¬cits which include global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual impairment, absent or severely delayed speech, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Some people with this condition have autismor autistic like behavior that affects communication and social interaction, such as poor eye contact, sensitivity to touch, and aggressive behaviors. They may also chew onnon food items such as clothing. Less frequently, people with this condition have seizures.

Nowakowska1 1Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland, 2MEDGEN, Warsaw, Poland Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a heterogenous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by problems in social interaction and communication as well as thepresence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviour. It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD. We elected to use oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 275 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high  resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non  polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k). Our study furtherconï¬rmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by the identi ï¬cation of two novel genes: LRRTM4 and DOCK1 as candidate for ASDs. B.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes.
