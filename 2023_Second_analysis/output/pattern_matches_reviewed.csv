Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous, with evi  dence for hundreds of susceptibility loci. Previous microarray and exome  sequencing studies have examined portions of the genome in simplex fami  lies (parents and one ASD affected child) having presumed sporadic forms of the disorder. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 85 quartet  families (parents and two ASD affected siblings), consisting of 170 indivi  duals with ASD, to generate a comprehensive data resource encompassing all classes of genetic variation (including noncoding variants) and accom panying phenotypes, in apparently familial forms of ASD. By examining de  novo and rare inherited single nucleotide and structural variations in genes  previously reported to be associated with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders, we found that more than two thirds of the affected siblings car  ried different ASD relevant mutations.

239,948,common variants in cadherin 10 gene show  association with autism spectrum disorders in Finnish  population,P09.022,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are severe neurodevelopmental  disorders that are highly heritable, but phenotypic and genetic het   erogeneity have made it challenging to identify predisposing variants  across populations. Although 10 20% of ASD cases are known to be  caused by rare high penetrance mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities,  and de novo DNA copy number variation, genome wide association  studies (GWAS) with large sample sizes have also revealed common  genetic variants associated with ASDs. Recently, several candidate  genes have been shown in independent studies to be associated with  ASDs in different populations. To test for association between ASDs  and genetic variants in these genes in the Finnish founder popula   tion, we have genotyped 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in eight candidate genes in families with autism (n,142) or Asperger  syndrome (AS; n,121) and performed association analyses. In the au   tism study sample, the most significant association was observed with  an intronic SNP in CDH10 , rs1505874 ( P,0.000066). In the AS study  sample, the most significant association was also observed in CDH10,  but with intronic rs6867043 ( P,0.000774). In a recent GWAS (Wang  et al.  2009), signals with a strong genome wide significance were ob   served in six SNPs located between CDH10  and CDH9 . Results from  our study support the role of CDH10  in ASDs using an independent  sample. To our knowledge, this is the first replicated association be   tween ASDs and CDH10  reported.

383,614,Custom designed CGH array in autism spectrum disorders,P05.030,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a complex multifac torial etilogy. Recently, copy number variants (CNVâs) have been shown to contribute to over 10% of ASD cases. Many of the known genes whose mutations cause ASD, have functions related to epigenetic regulation. We have applied a custom designed oligo array CGH with an exonic overlapping coverage of 450 genes known to cause autism or intellectual disability and autism candidate genes related to epigenetic machinery.Material and methods: Custom oligonucleotide arrays (formats 4x44 and 8x60) were designed with e Array Agilent technology. The final array design contains: 36,000 exonic probes for 450 genes considered of high priority (mean distance between probes 25bp), 2,000 probes for regulatory ele ments and microRNAâs and 22,000 whole genome probes (backbone).Results: We have studied a series of 139 patients including syndromic au   tism and/or familial cases of idiopathic autism. We have found 24 cases with pathological CNVâs. Most are non recurrent CNV, what allow us to propose new candidate genes involved in autism.Discussion: Our results confirm the importance of three regions in autism: Xq28 (MECP2), 22q13 (SHANK3) and 16q13, while all others regions are extremely heterogeneous.

Here we present CNV analysis for a cohort of 183 consanguineous families with one or more children affected with ASD. We provide new insights into the genetic architecture of ASDs as our cohort is uniquely enriched for recessive loss of function variants. We follow up fin dings and draw comparisons with additional large ASD and control data   sets: the Simons Simplex and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collections (2,670 affected individuals; 9681 total individuals). Comparing across these cohorts, we demonstrate that ascertainment can lead to selec tion of different underlying genetic mechanisms causing ASDs. These diffe rences are reflected in metrics such as the affected male:female ratio and the relative contribution of de novo CNVs versus inherited homozygous de   letions. Specifically, we find that de novo CNVs play a significant role in non consanguineous families with a single affected child (p,0.04), but a lesser role in multiplex families, and they are no more common in ASD cases than  controls in multiplex consanguineous families.

621,742, Genomic and genetic variation at complex segmental duplications in Autism Spectrum disorders,P09.018,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most heri   table neurodevelopmental conditions but the aetiology remains elusive in a high proportion of cases. Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients  and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population.Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func  tional GTF2IRD2  genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls.  We also identified a disruptive mutation (p.M1?) in a GTF2IRD2  copy in two  affected brothers, inherited from their father. In the chr9 pericentromeric region, a de novo deletion was identified in a patient but the global distribu  tion of rearrangements and rare SNVs did not differ significantly between controls and patients.Conclusions: Despite their complex genetic architecture, our method suc cessfully identifies rearrangements and SNVs in SDs, such as copy gains and mutations at GTF2IRD2 or deletions of CNTNAP3 that could represent sus  ceptibility factors for ASD.Grant support: FISPI1302481/PI1300823/FEDER, 2014SGR1468 and FI DGR/2013.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  182Back to index",2016,,"M.

Epidemiological evidence from family and twin studies supports a strong genetic component in ASD etiology. Oxidative stress and abnormal DNA me thylation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. Brain tissues from ASD cases showed higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers than healthy controls in postmortem analysis. Association between oxidative stress and DNA damage has been well known. Thus, we sought to investiga te a potential link between DNA repair genes and ASD and analyze the role of XPD Asp312Asn and XRCC4 G 1394T gene polymorphisms for ASD in the Turkish population.Material and Methods: Genotyping was conducted by PCR RFLP based on 100 patients and 96 unrelated healthy controls.Results: We, for the first time, demonstrated a positive association between XRCC4 gene variants and ASD risk. Frequencies of XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotypes were higher in patients (%34) than the controls (%18.7). The statistical analysis revealed that the individuals who had XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotype had an increased risk for ASD (OR , 2.23, 95% CI , 1.10 4.55). However, no significant association was found for XPD Asp312Asn polymorphism with the risk of ASD.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that XRCC4 G 1394T polymorphism might be associated with ASD pathogenesis.

Human accelerated regions (HARs) repre  sent conserved genomic loci with elevated divergence in humans compared to other primate and non primate species.At least some HARs are thought to contribute to neurode  velopmental functions underlying the unique social and behavioral traits of humans. If some HARs regulate human speciï¬c social and behavioral traits, then mutations would likely impact cognitive and social disorders. Recent studies support the role of HARs in complex neurodevelopmentalfunctions and associated disorders including Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia.

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi  duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%). CYP2D6 metabo  lizes most psychoactive drugs, while CYP1A1 acts on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of endocrine disrupting chemi cals (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A). Early exposure to neurotoxic phthalates, bisphenol A and PAHs has been previously associated with ASD risk, and here we provideevidence for an effect of gene environmental exposure interaction mediated by CYP450 gene variants.

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER. This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore.

344,959, Contribution of rare and common variants of the PTCHD1 gene to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability,P09.028,,"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by impaired verbal communication, limited reciprocal social interaction, restricted inte rests and repetitive behavior, often accompanied by intellectual disability (ID). Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study. The  study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German). Twenty eight tagSNPs were selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. A significant association, that over   came the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and permutations was obtained with the marker rs7052177 (p, 6.13e 4). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible participation of PTCHD1 rare variants in ASD and  ID, we are currently performing a mutation screening in the Spanish ASD cohort, and in an additional sample of 200 individuals with ID.

651,1295, The use of automated facial analysis in the clinical diagnostic of autism spectrum disorders (ASD),P14.005,,"Introduction: Autism can be part of a genetic syndrome associating with dysmorphic features. While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver  Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis   order 1 were identified. Conclusion: The preliminary results show that deep phenotyping provided  by a computer aided facial analysis could be instrumental in the early clini cal diagnostic of the syndromic ASD forms and could help in the selection of diagnostic molecular tests.

417,735,Synaptic transmission: looking for clues to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) etiology in Copy Number Variants containing synaptic genes,P06.15,,"Copy Number Variants (CNVs) play an important role in susceptibility to  ASD, often mediated by the deletion or duplication of genes involved in  synaptic structure and function. In this study we tested the hypothesis that  there is an enrichment in CNVs encompassing synaptic transmission genes in ASD.To obtain a list of genes involved in synaptic structure and function, we que ry pathway databases for synaptic pathways (KEGG and GO). By intersecting this list with the results of a large CNV genomic screening in ASD patients (performed by the Autism Genome Project), and CNV information on the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), we found a significantly increased bur den of CNVs encompassing synaptic genes in ASD subjects compared to DGV controls (Fisher exact test P,2.2X10  16, OR,1.47). Detailed analysis of the frequencies of each synaptic gene duplicated or de   leted by CNVs in ASD and control subjects identified 39 genes that were si gnificantly more frequent in ASD (P<0.05). Closer inspection of CNV overlap between the ASD sample and additional control databases (eg SAGE, Pop Gene) highlighted synaptic structure or function genes (eg NF1, GABRG1,  CHRNA7 ) that warrant further investigation. Additionally, 5 synaptic genes,  PLA2G1B, PPP2R3C, KCNK7, ADCY7 and RAPSN , were disrupted by CNVs ex   clusively in the ASD dataset, and were also absent from the additional con trol CNV databases queried.The present results show an excess of structural alterations encompassing synaptic genes in ASD and highlight candidate genes for sequencing and functional studies.

The nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway is essential to control mRNA quality and has an important role in the regulation of thetranscriptome. Mutations in genes involved in the NMD pathway, such as the UPF3B gene, a core component of this pathway, were previously linked to ASD. In this study weexplored the potential role of other NMD factors in ASD. We generated a list of 153 genes involved in the NMD pathway using AmiGO, Reactome and a systematic litera ture review. To identify potentially pathogenic variants in the NMD genes, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data (WES) data from 1338 ASD subjects. We also searched forCopy Number Variants (CNVs) targeting NMD genes in ASD patients (n ,3570) and checked their frequency in controls (n ,9649). We identi ï¬ed 43 high impact variants in 28 NMD genes, including the UPF3B and ACE, two genes previously implicated in ASD. Importantly, 11 were novel candidategenes that carry loss of function and missense (deleterious and damaging) variants with a frequency of 1 to 5% in this ASD dataset. Additionally, 5 NMD genes were found to betargeted by CNVs in 12 ASD subjects but none of the controls.

620,741,Contribution of chromosomal aberrations in mosaicism to Autism Spectrum Disorders,P09.017,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequent  neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD has a strong genetic component in its  etiology, including de novo germ line mutations and copy number variants.  Detectable mosaicism for chromosomal rearrangements in blood has been reported in >1% of the aging population (>65y), but is very rare in young  people. Chromosomal mosaicism due to early developmental events could  be causative of ASD.Methods: We have studied molecular karyotypes (SNP array) of blood DNA of two large ASD datasets, the Autism Genome Project and the Simons Sim  plex Collection (4427 patients, 9268 parents, 2433 unaffected siblings) for  mosaic chromosomal alterations >0.4Mb, using the MAD and Tripod soft wares. As age matched controls, we also used reported data of 5094 child  ren with no developmental abnormalities. We independently analyzed data  from cell line DNA of 564 patients and 806 parents.Results: Mosaic alterations (0.4 155Mb) were detected in blood DNA of  21 out of 4427 patients (0,47%). A total of 34 events were also detected  in parental samples (0,37%) and 5/7517 unaffected children (0,07%). The frequency of detectable mosaicism is significantly higher in ASD patients. In cell line DNA, the frequency was similar in cases and parents although 6 unbalanced chromosomal translocations were detected in patients and just 1 in parents.Conclusion: Chromosomal aberrations present in mosaicism are detected in blood samples of a small but significant proportion of children with ASD (0,47%).

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi  duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%). CYP2D6 metabo  lizes most psychoactive drugs, while CYP1A1 acts on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of endocrine disrupting chemi cals (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A). Early exposure to neurotoxic phthalates, bisphenol A and PAHs has been previously associated with ASD risk, and here we provideevidence for an effect of gene environmental exposure interaction mediated by CYP450 gene variants.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous, with evi  dence for hundreds of susceptibility loci. Previous microarray and exome  sequencing studies have examined portions of the genome in simplex fami  lies (parents and one ASD affected child) having presumed sporadic forms of the disorder. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 85 quartet  families (parents and two ASD affected siblings), consisting of 170 indivi  duals with ASD, to generate a comprehensive data resource encompassing all classes of genetic variation (including noncoding variants) and accom panying phenotypes, in apparently familial forms of ASD. By examining de  novo and rare inherited single nucleotide and structural variations in genes  previously reported to be associated with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders, we found that more than two thirds of the affected siblings car  ried different ASD relevant mutations. These siblings with discordant muta   tions tended to demonstrate more clinical variability than those who shared  a risk variant. Our study emphasizes that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in ASD, necessitating the use of WGS to delineate all genic and non genic susceptibility variants in research and in clinical diagnostics.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental condi   tion with highly complex genetic predisposition. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of both sequence and structural rare variations in ASD susceptibility. In particular, focusing on rare copy number variants (CNVs) has already been highly productive in uncovering an increasing num ber of specific genes and chromosomal intervals conferring risk to ASD.During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach on 9 multiplex ASD families from Sardinia, we identified a rare genic deletion of ~37 Kb, transmitted from the unaffected mother to both affected siblings. This deletion includes the entire CAPG gene and the last coding exons of  ELMOD3 . CAPG encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin re  gulatory proteins, that might be involved in control of dendritic spine shape. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, with recently proposed functional links to sound perception and actin cytoske leton.No deletions involving this genomic region were found in 4768 controls from published high resolution SNP array data, while other two deletions encompassing CAPG and ELMOD3 have been reported in two subjects with  ASD, suggesting that CAPG and/or ELMOD3 haploinsufficiency may have  clinical relevance to ASD. In order to test this hypothesis together with a recessive model of inheritance, we first excluded that this deletion is a com mon polymorphism in Sardinia, then we performed expression and muta   tion analysis of both genes in the discovery pedigree, and a further clinical evaluation of all family members.Grant references: Fondazione Banco di Sardegna, Kyulan Family Foundati o",2015,,"E.

We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including  GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome. Specifi   cally, duplications were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of speech, and lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features. Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant. We concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients. We now report more convincing evidences that dosage balance at GPRIN2 locus plays a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We observed 6 pati   ents affected by ASD with an overlapping small deletion including the two genes (and extending to MAPK8 in one patient).

The deletion was excluded in one of the maternal uncles.CADPS2 is a calcium binding protein that regulates the exocytosis of synaptic and dense core vesicles in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. CADPS2 is a candidate gene for autistic disorders, since it maps in the  autism susceptibility region AUTS1 on chromosome 7q31.32, which alsocorresponds to a candidate region for mood disorders. Knock out mice show an autistic like phenotype and some ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) patients show a possible defect in CADPS2 splicing.

In a mutation screening of KLHL23 in 85 multiplex familis with ASD we identified a damaging variant (M65V), absent in controls, and segregating  with the ASD in an affected sibling pair. Taken together our results suggest that rare variants altering KLHL23 func tion in the brain, could contribute to ASD risk in a small number of cases.  S. Lomartire: None. E. Bacchelli: None. F.

The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain.Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi   dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion.In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription. In conclusion, rare sequence variants in CHRNA7 do not significantly contribute to ASD susceptibility, at least in our clinical sample characterized by low frequency of associated medical comorbidity.

487,858, S The role of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor in epileptogenesis,P09.105,,"NMDA receptors are tetrameric ligand gated ion channels composed of two glycine binding NR1 subunits and two glutamate binding NR2 subunits (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, NR2D) regulating synaptic plasticity. Mutations in the NR2A and NR2B subunits encoded by the genes GRIN2A  and GRIN2B  have  been associated with different phenotypes of intellectual disability (ID). Mutations in GRIN2A  were known to cause unspecific ID and epilepsy as  well as other neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas mutations in GRIN2B have mainly been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but not seizures. We show for the first time that mutations of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor cause different and specific epilepsy phenotypes. NR2 muta   tions are involved in benign Rolandic epilepsy, the most frequent childhood epilepsy as well as in a variety of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathi es, such as Landau Kleffner and West syndrome. Furthermore, we demon   strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign  Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre  sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations. The severity of phenotypes depends on the af fected domain and the extent of receptor activation.

Material and Methods: We used microarray data from probands with ASD (n ,2926) and their unaffected siblings (n,2434) from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). CNVs were called, validated, and subsequently ï¬ltered using established pipelines and detection algorithms (PennCNV, QuantiSNP, SnipPeep).

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families. The identi ï¬ed biallelic damaging variants could affect the CACNA1H protein activity with a recessive model and contribute to the disease development in the context of a high risk genetic background. Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.Supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Grant GR 2013 02357561).",2021,,M.

629,752, Copy number variation in 19 Italian multiplex families with autism spectrum disorder: importance of synaptic and neurite elongation genes,P09.028,,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is endowed with impressive heritability estima tes and high recurrence rates. Its genetic underpinnings are very heteroge neous and include many common and rare variants located in hundreds of different loci, each characterized by variable levels of penetrance. Multiplex families from single ethnic groups represent a useful means to reduce hete rogeneity and enhance genetic load. We screened 19 Italian ASD multiplex families (3 triplets and 16 duplets, total N,41 ASD subjects), using array CGH (Agilent 180K). Certainly or probably causal CNVs, defined Ã¢ÂÂclinical   ly relevant CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ, were detected in 17/41 (41%) of ASD probands, corre sponding to 9/19 (47%) multiplex families with at least one affected sibling genetically positive. However only in 3/9 (33%) of these families, siblings share the same causal or highly causal CNV. Additional potentially relevant CNVs not shared by affected sib pairs were detected also in these three fa milies. 45 genes are located on the Ã¢ÂÂclinically relevantÃ¢ÂÂ CNVs. Through an enrichment analysis, we found that 9/45 (20%) of these genes appear pri marily involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation/management. Our results highlight the importance of synaptic and neurite elongation ge nes in the pathogenesis of autism, despite genetic heterogeneity in ASD even within multiplex families belonging to a single ethnic group. Differences in CNV burden may likely contribute to the substantial clinical heterogeneity observed between affected sibs.

240,959,Systematic evaluation of the clinical significance of  inherited and de novo copy Number Variations in families with  Autism spectrum Disorders,P09.033,,"Array based studies have detected a wealth of copy number variations  (CNVs) in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Since some  CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini   cal significance of de novo  and inherited CNVs containing genes being  transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive   ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were  grouped into four categories. First, de novo  CNVs in families with both  parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from  a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely  to be causally related to ASD. The genes in these two categories par   ticipate in pathways probably associated with ASD, such as contactin  based cell communication ( CNTN5 , CNTN6 ), phosphoinositol signaling  (PIK3CA ), and regulation of neurotransmitter levels ( KCNMB4 , TPH2 ).  The de novo  CNVs found in patients with at least one parent scoring  higher than 1 SD above the mean on the SRS, and the CNVs inher   ited from an unaffected parent, while the other parent has an elevated  SRS score, are likely to exert a minor contribution to the phenotype.  Our analysis also indicates that in 6 out of 48 ASD patients two or more  genetic etiologies may be involved.

We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including  GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome.

Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant. We concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients.

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autistic spectrum. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndromes in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval.Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan   ces. We selected a large and unique panel of WBS and 7dup ASD patients and derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the most advanced reprogramming technology based on synthetic mRNAs. These were then differentiated into relevant lineages to establish experimentally tractable models of these conditions.

PARK2 ge netic mutations are associated with Parkinson Disease, while Copy Number Variants (CNV) have been found in patients with developmental delay (DD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and ASD.We identified 5 male patients with inherited PARK2 deletions in 342 ASD indi   viduals, screened for CNVs using Illumina 1M SNP arrays (frequency,1.5%). Three patients had a 45Kb deletion of intron 9, and two patients had a deleti on of either 29Kb in intron 6 or 266Kb encompassing exons 5 and 6. Clinical presentation was heterogeneous in these ASD patients. A literature search showed recurrent deletions of introns 2 and 3 (N,15 ADHD, N,7 ASD), as  well as exons 1 (N,1 ASD) and 2 (N,2 ASD and DD), while DECIPHER re  ported one ASD individual with an exon 5 6 deletion. In available control databases, deletions of segments from exons 1 to intron 4 as well as intron 9 were recurrent, but only 1/4139 controls had a CNV overlapping exon 6,  suggesting a pathogenic role of deletions in this region. The smaller exon  6 CNVs deleted a functional domain SYT11 binding site, compromising the  attachment of synaptotagmin and ubiquitination.These results support a role of PARK2 structural variants in ASD.

620,741,Contribution of chromosomal aberrations in mosaicism to Autism Spectrum Disorders,P09.017,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequent  neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD has a strong genetic component in its  etiology, including de novo germ line mutations and copy number variants.  Detectable mosaicism for chromosomal rearrangements in blood has been reported in >1% of the aging population (>65y), but is very rare in young  people. Chromosomal mosaicism due to early developmental events could  be causative of ASD.Methods: We have studied molecular karyotypes (SNP array) of blood DNA of two large ASD datasets, the Autism Genome Project and the Simons Sim  plex Collection (4427 patients, 9268 parents, 2433 unaffected siblings) for  mosaic chromosomal alterations >0.4Mb, using the MAD and Tripod soft wares. As age matched controls, we also used reported data of 5094 child  ren with no developmental abnormalities. We independently analyzed data  from cell line DNA of 564 patients and 806 parents.Results: Mosaic alterations (0.4 155Mb) were detected in blood DNA of  21 out of 4427 patients (0,47%). A total of 34 events were also detected  in parental samples (0,37%) and 5/7517 unaffected children (0,07%). The frequency of detectable mosaicism is significantly higher in ASD patients. In cell line DNA, the frequency was similar in cases and parents although 6 unbalanced chromosomal translocations were detected in patients and just 1 in parents.Conclusion: Chromosomal aberrations present in mosaicism are detected in blood samples of a small but significant proportion of children with ASD (0,47%). This finding at early ages suggests that mosaicism may be present in other cell types affecting brain development and causing ASD.",2016,,"M. Lopez Sanchez, I. CuscÃÂ³, A. CÃÂ¡ceres, J. R.

Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients  and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population.Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func  tional GTF2IRD2  genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls.  We also identified a disruptive mutation (p.M1?) in a GTF2IRD2  copy in two  affected brothers, inherited from their father. In the chr9 pericentromeric region, a de novo deletion was identified in a patient but the global distribu  tion of rearrangements and rare SNVs did not differ significantly between controls and patients.Conclusions: Despite their complex genetic architecture, our method suc cessfully identifies rearrangements and SNVs in SDs, such as copy gains and mutations at GTF2IRD2 or deletions of CNTNAP3 that could represent sus  ceptibility factors for ASD.Grant support: FISPI1302481/PI1300823/FEDER, 2014SGR1468 and FI DGR/2013.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  182Back to index",2016,,"M.

673,1902, Genetics of language deficits in schizophrenia and autism: an evolutionary approach,P09.38,,"Both autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are highly prevalent cognitive disorders, entailing language deficits. Recent advances in genome wide technologies have provided with a long list of candidate genes for SZ and ASD, but the gap between genes, the pathophysiology of SZ and ASD, and their distinctive cognitive and linguistic profiles still remains open. Our study aims to bridge this gap through an evo devo approach that focuses on how language evolved in the species and that construes both con ditions as poles of a continuum of modes of cognition, also encompassing typically developing cognition. To this aim, we have performed literature mining and network analysis of known candidate genes for SZ and ASD and found that they are overrepresented among the gene believed to be impor   tant for the evolution of the human faculty of language. Many of these genes are common risk factors for both conditions. Additionally, we performed in silico data mining of previously published SZ and ASD microarray data   sets and found that many of these genes important for language evolution (like CNTNAP2, DLX5, FOXP1, or ROBO2) are differentially expressed in the brains of schizophrenics and autists. We will conclude that the (substanti   ally opposite) linguistic (dys)abilities seen in SZ and ASD patients may re present abnormal (but still related) ontogenetic itineraries for the human faculty of language and that the same factors that prompted the transition from an ape like cognition to a human specific cognition may explain the high prevalence of SZ and ASD, but also their related cognitive profiles.Grant: FFI2014 61888 EXP E",2016,,"A.

Monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders which showed autistic behavior patterns have sugges tedsynaptic dysfunction, as a key mechanism in the patho  physiology of ASD. Subsequently, genes involved in synaptic signaling have been investigated with a priority forcandidategene studies. A synaptosomal associated protein 25(SNAP25) gene plays a crucial role in the central ner  voussystem, contributing to exocytosis by targeting andfusion ofvesicles to the cell membrane. Studies have shown a correlation between aberrant expression of theSNA  P25and a varietyof brain diseases. Single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) inthis gene are associated with several psychiatric diseases, suchas bipolar, schizophrenia, and attention de ï¬cit/hyperactivitydisorder. The aim of the pre  sent study was to investigatewhether polymorphisms (rs3746544 and rs1051312) in theregulatory 3 â² untranslated region (3 â²UTR) of theSNAP25gene have an association with ASD in unrelated Iranian case(N ,524) control (N , 472) samples.

Incomplete penetrance of theaffected genes and variable expressivity usually is indicated as cause of clinical features. Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities.Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro  mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol  vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ï¬rmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet.

Materials and Methods: In the context of an Interna  tional project aiming at identifying the genetic causes of ASD (Autism Sequencing Consortium, Mount Sinai), weperformed a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis in a cohort of 100 ASD patients, not harboring CNVs, attending the Medical Genetics Unit of Siena. Results: Mutations in already known ASD related genes were detected in 11% of cases, while either de novo or inherited mutations in novel genes were identi ï¬ed in 21% of cases. The novel identi ï¬ed genes can be pooled in three categories: i genes for which causative mutations have not1378been previously reported (eight genes), ii genes for which a likely association with ASD has been previously reported in a single case (eg DRP2 etc) and iii genes whose mutations have been previously associated with intellectual disability (ID) in only one (eg BCORL1 etc) or a few families (eg BRD4 recently associated with a Cornelia De Lange likephenotype etc). Conclusions: Overall, our extensive approach goes beyond safely con ï¬rming the pathogenic role of ASD/ID candidate genes and allows establishing the novel role of ID related genes in ASD.

The nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway is essential to control mRNA quality and has an important role in the regulation of thetranscriptome. Mutations in genes involved in the NMD pathway, such as the UPF3B gene, a core component of this pathway, were previously linked to ASD. In this study weexplored the potential role of other NMD factors in ASD. We generated a list of 153 genes involved in the NMD pathway using AmiGO, Reactome and a systematic litera ture review. To identify potentially pathogenic variants in the NMD genes, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data (WES) data from 1338 ASD subjects. We also searched forCopy Number Variants (CNVs) targeting NMD genes in ASD patients (n ,3570) and checked their frequency in controls (n ,9649). We identi ï¬ed 43 high impact variants in 28 NMD genes, including the UPF3B and ACE, two genes previously implicated in ASD. Importantly, 11 were novel candidategenes that carry loss of function and missense (deleterious and damaging) variants with a frequency of 1 to 5% in this ASD dataset. Additionally, 5 NMD genes were found to betargeted by CNVs in 12 ASD subjects but none of the controls.

771,458,A Establishing genotype phenotype associations for ASD,P09.026,,"Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) has hindered the establishment of genotype phenotype associations. Herein, we presented a novel approach that integrates semantic similarity andunsupervised machine learning methods to dissect the ASD genotypic heterogeneity and to identify phenotypic mani  festations of ASD genetic variants. This approach wasapplied to copy number variants (N ,6650), disrupting 3998 genes from 1119 ASD patients. Functional similarities among genes were computed using Resnik semanticsimilarity measure. Semantic similarity score, ranging from 0 to 1 represents the functional similarity between two genes, where 1 represents identical genes while score 0reï¬ects functionally dissimilar genes. Agglomerative hier  archical clustering of the computed gene similarity matrix identi ï¬ed four different clusters of functionally related genes. Silhouette analysis indicated that clusters were compact and consistent (average Silhouette value ,0.31). The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD. Cluster 1 genes were also most signiï¬cantly enriched for Schizophrenia Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term, which is a co occurring condition with ASD. The other three clusters were not enriched for ASD related HPO terms. The results indicated thatphenotypic genotypic associations can established for ASD by reducing its genotypic heterogeneity i.e. clustering of functionally similar genes. However, to associate theseclusters with phenotype, further efforts are required to enrich HPO resource. (Grant reference: PTDC/CCI BIO/ 28685/2017) A.C.G. IlhÃ©u: None. M. Asif: None. F.M.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components.

481,780, S Genetic evidence that hyperactive Th2 and NK immune pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder,P09.023,,"Converging evidence suggests that abnormal immunity is involved in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) both in children and  adults. Altered immune processes include ongoing neuroinflammation in  post mortem brains, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal  fluid and blood, altered immune cell function, presence of brain specific  auto antibodies, and dysregulated immune transcriptome. One strategy to  assess whether dysimmunity contributes to ASD pathogenesis or represents  a collateral by standing effect is to investigate whether functional SNPs  known to influence immune gene expression or function are associated with  ASD. We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro  band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in  all major immune pathways. Statistically significant opposite transmission  patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression  and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite  alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi  nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG)  activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autistic disorder in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014,,"I.

591,141,A Complex Mutational Spectrum of Structural Variation Contributing to Autism,C15.1,,"Recent genomic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have relied upon genome wide characterization of coding mutations using whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variants (CNV) using chromosomal microarray (CMA). In ASD, these efforts have revealed a strong associati on with de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and CNVs segments that alter the dosage of genes under evolutionary constraint. Unfortunately, the impact of balanced and complex structural variation (SV), which also repre sent LoF variation, remains uncharacterized in ASD and other human disea   se studies. Here, we explored the full mutational spectrum of SV contribu ting to ASD by integrating large insert, short insert and synthetic long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies with CMA in 307 idiopathic ASD probands and 120 family members from the Simons Simplex Collec tion. Analyses revealed a diverse landscape of SVs beyond canonical CNVs, including inversions, insertions, and translocations. We also categorized 13 distinct subclasses of recurrent complex SVs and demonstrate that each ge nome sequenced harbored at least one such large complex rearrangement (~5 kb resolution). We identified 26 de novo SVs likely contributing to ASD, 50% of which were cryptic to detection by previous technologies on the se same samples. These data confirmed 13 previously proposed ASD risk factors and discovered 12 novel candidates. We estimate that the overall contribution of de novo SVs in ASD at this resolution to be at least 8.2%, or a two fold increase over previous analyses restricted to CNVs. These data suggest that cryptic and complex SV represent an important and presently underappreciated component of ASD etiology.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ï¬rst benchmarked our bioinfor  matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conï¬rmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub  stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ï¬rst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B.B.

630,753, Increased frequency of the autism broader phenotype in mothers transmitting etiological CNVs to sons affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),P09.029,,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder with a high male to female ratio. An increased prevalence of autism like perso   nality traits is found in unaffected relatives of ASD children, suggesting a genetic liability of a broader autism phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that the parents of ASD children who transmit etiological CNVs might exhi bit ASD traits more frequently than non transmitting parents. To test this hypothesis, we analysed CNV inheritance and parental behavioral traits in families from the Autism Genome Project, assessed using the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) (N,341) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (N,456). We selected CNVs spanning well established candidate genes for ASD, and compared transmitting and non transmitting parental test scores using a t test corrected for multiple testing by the Group Benja   mini Hochberg Procedure. Overall, CNV transmitting parents did not differ significantly in BAPQ and  SRS scores from non transmitting parents. However, independent analyses of relative pairs revealed a significant difference in BAPQ global (t, 2.18; ad  justed P,.032), BAPQ aloofness domain (t, 2.61; adjusted P,.032) and SRS  scores (t, 2.03; adjusted P,.047) between mothers transmitting and mo thers not transmitting etiological CNVs to their affected sons. Our findings  indicate that mothers presenting personality traits in the broader autism  phenotype are frequently carriers of pathogenic CNVs that they transmit to their ASD sons. The results from the analyses of maternal phenotype and CNV transmission patterns to sons support previous reports of maternal  transmission bias to male offspring, and the prevalent hypothesis of a high  er genetic risk tolerance in females due to putative protective factors.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that  there is an enrichment in CNVs encompassing synaptic transmission genes in ASD.To obtain a list of genes involved in synaptic structure and function, we que ry pathway databases for synaptic pathways (KEGG and GO). By intersecting this list with the results of a large CNV genomic screening in ASD patients (performed by the Autism Genome Project), and CNV information on the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), we found a significantly increased bur den of CNVs encompassing synaptic genes in ASD subjects compared to DGV controls (Fisher exact test P,2.2X10  16, OR,1.47). Detailed analysis of the frequencies of each synaptic gene duplicated or de   leted by CNVs in ASD and control subjects identified 39 genes that were si gnificantly more frequent in ASD (P<0.05). Closer inspection of CNV overlap between the ASD sample and additional control databases (eg SAGE, Pop Gene) highlighted synaptic structure or function genes (eg NF1, GABRG1,  CHRNA7 ) that warrant further investigation.

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER. This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore. To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com  pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases. The subject âs transcriptome showed increased expression (>5sd) of genes including the ATP2A3 calcium pump and purinergic receptors, and extremely lowexpression (>24sd) of VDAC2, a mitochondrial calcium uptake channel.

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families. The identi ï¬ed biallelic damaging variants could affect the CACNA1H protein activity with a recessive model and contribute to the disease development in the context of a high risk genetic background. Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.Supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Grant GR 2013 02357561).",2021,,M.

Emerging evidence suggest s that various genetic compo nents can account for these cases according to an oligogenic model. After the observation of a patient with deleterious variants inmultiple genes (FrontGenet, https://doi.org/10.3389/ fgene.2021.625564 ), we extended the search for possible oligogenic mechanisms to a cohort of 30 ASD trio families. Methods : Whole exome sequencing was performed and potentially deleterious variants prioritized by custom ï¬ltering strategies including the use of ORVAL (Oligogenic Resource for Variant Analysis Platform) and enrichment analysis of candidategenes with GeneCodis4. Results : Two cases showed possible deleterious rare variants, each in 3 different genes. A male patient was carrying 2 maternally inherited variants, one hemizygous in BCOR and one heterozygous inMYO9B , genes associated to cognitive and behaviour impair ment. A third heterozygous paternally inherited variant affected HTR1E , a serotonin receptor hypothesized to play a role in autism like behaviour and sleep disturbance. The second case, anothermale patient, had 2 maternally inherited variants, one hemizygousinZC4H2 , associated to developmental delay, and one hetero zygous in ALDH5A1 , associated to behaviour and sleep impair ment. A further paternally inherited variant affected CPLX3 , involved in neurotransmitter release, hypothesized to be impli cated in neurodevelopmental delay.

420,738,Homozygous exonic deletion in CTNNA3 suggests a role for alfaT catenin in susceptibility to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs),P06.18,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable, neurodevelopmen tal conditions, showing extreme genetic heterogeneity. While it is well esta blished that de novo genetic variation plays an important role in ASD risk, recent studies have demonstrated a convincing evidence of a rare recessive contribution to the heritability of ASDs.In the genome wide CNV study carried out by the Autism Genetic Consorti   um (AGP), we identified one homozygous deletion intersecting the CTNNA3 gene in an Italian proband with ASD and moderate intellectual disability (PIQ,50). This deletion includes a coding exon, leading to a putative frames hift and premature stop codon, inherited from both parents, each heterozy   gote for a deletion of slightly different length. The unaffected sister is also heterozygote for the deletion.CTNNA3 encodes for the alfaT catenin protein that has a crucial role in cel lular adherence showing suggestive association in GWAS and a de novo de   letion.Even if the frequency of exonic deletions of CTNNA3 is not significantly dif   ferent between ASDs cases and controls (17/2446 cases and 35/5097 con trols, P,.88), no homozygous exonic deletions were found in a sample of  5097 controls, suggesting that only the complete knockout of CTNNA3 could  cause or confer susceptibility for ASDs. Expression analysis of alfaT catenin and alfaN catenin proteins in mouse cortex and hippocampus (P0 P90), provided further support of a role of CTNNA3 in early mid fetal develop  ment of the brain. While the exact biological significance of CTNNA3 homozygous deletion is yet to be determined, we hypothesize that it could have clinical relevance to  the ASDs phenotype in this Italian patient.  E.

Chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) has offered a high detection rate of small and large CNVs associated with ASD, and ledto discovery of new autism genes. We report on the results of chromosomal CMA investigation in a group of ASDs patients. Eighty patients were referred to our laboratory forgenetic testing with ASDs as part of a broad phenotype including ID or other clinical features. A complete clinical evaluation was performed with focus on psychiatric exam ination and psychological evaluation with speci ï¬c ASDs tests (ADOS, ADI R). Array CGH completed with kar  yotyping, FISH and qPCR tests were performed. A total of21 pathological CNVs (14 deletions and 7 duplications), with a median length of 3.7 Mb were detected in 17 patients. The involved genomic regions overlap 550 OMIMgenes. Besides well described syndromic regions associated with ASDs (e.g. deletions of 1q21.1, 22q13.3, 22q11.2, MBD5; Xq28 duplication), other genomic regions, rarelyreported in patients with ASDs were identi ï¬ed (deletion of 8p11.2p21.2, 9q34.1, 9p13, duplication of 7p22.2p22.1 , CHRNA7) ; thus having the potential to reveal new ASD genes.

Today,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1439chromosomal microarray is the ï¬rst tier recommended diagnostic test and provides a yield around 10 15% for ID patients and around 9% for ASDs patients, depending on the cohort. Our goal is to evaluate if the diagnostic yield estimated by targeted sequencing in our cohorts of ID or ASDs subjects is higher than that obtained by CGH array.We screened 701 in house selected ID related genes and 189 autism related genes in a cohort of more than 100 and 60 patients, respectively. Libraries were prepared withdifferent capture kits and the Illumina NextSeq500 platform was used to sequence targeted regions. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with an in house pipeline. Thediagnostic yield was 41% in the ID cohort and 20% in the ASDs cohort. Variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 50% of the ID patients and 72% of the autism patients and negative results were obtained in 9% and 8% of the ID and autism individuals, respectively. ID or autism  related genes sequencing provide higher diagnostic yieldsthan CGH array. Furthermore, copy number variants evaluation could be performed simultaneously with our pipeline. For this reason, we proposed targeted sequencingas the ï¬rst tier genetic test for ID and autism diagnosis. M. PeÃ±a Vilabelda: A.

239,948,common variants in cadherin 10 gene show  association with autism spectrum disorders in Finnish  population,P09.022,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are severe neurodevelopmental  disorders that are highly heritable, but phenotypic and genetic het   erogeneity have made it challenging to identify predisposing variants  across populations. Although 10 20% of ASD cases are known to be  caused by rare high penetrance mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities,  and de novo DNA copy number variation, genome wide association  studies (GWAS) with large sample sizes have also revealed common  genetic variants associated with ASDs. Recently, several candidate  genes have been shown in independent studies to be associated with  ASDs in different populations. To test for association between ASDs  and genetic variants in these genes in the Finnish founder popula   tion, we have genotyped 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in eight candidate genes in families with autism (n,142) or Asperger  syndrome (AS; n,121) and performed association analyses. In the au   tism study sample, the most significant association was observed with  an intronic SNP in CDH10 , rs1505874 ( P,0.000066). In the AS study  sample, the most significant association was also observed in CDH10,  but with intronic rs6867043 ( P,0.000774). In a recent GWAS (Wang  et al.  2009), signals with a strong genome wide significance were ob   served in six SNPs located between CDH10  and CDH9 . Results from  our study support the role of CDH10  in ASDs using an independent  sample. To our knowledge, this is the first replicated association be   tween ASDs and CDH10  reported.

245,1432,Molecular genetic testing of mental retardation in  Bulgaria,P12.128,,"Mental retardation is highly heterogeneous in clinical and genetic point  of view. Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.  Most probably this is due to the characteristics of this group, being  clinically mixed and containing some definite autistic cases.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.  Conclusion: The Arg468His mutation is the most prevalent (6/14 fami   lies) mutation in MFN2 causing CMT2A in Spanish patients and our  study confirmed that it is actually pathological, presenting as a neu   ropathy in a mild to moderate degree.",2010,,"T.

479,778, S Three SNP haplotypes in Neuroligins may correlate to autism susceptibility,P09.021,,"Chemistry  and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

61,328,Rett patients with both MECP2 mutation and 15q11  13 rearrangments.,P237.,,"Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism (A) are classified as separate  disorders. Recently, the identification of the Preserved Speech  Variant (PSV), where autistic behavior is usual, stressed the  phenotypic overlap between these two conditions. In 1999 it was  shown that about 80% of RTT cases have a de novo  mutation in  the transcriptional silencer MECP2  gene, classifying RTT as a  monogenic X L dominant disorder. Subsequently, we and others  provided evidence that this model was too simple and not sufficient  to explain why germline MECP2  mutations may result in X L mental  retardation in males while they may be silent in carrier females. On  the other hand, we and others have provided evidence that 15q11  q13 maternally inherited duplications are found in autistic children,  suggesting that an abnormal dosage of gene(s) within this region  might be responsible for A. Now we show that a proportion of RTT  patients are carriers of both a MECP2  mutation and a 15q11 q13  duplication and that other RTT patients are carriers of a MECP2   mutation and a 15q11 q13 duplication. Therefore, we hypothesize  a complex model in which a MECP2  mutation is necessary but not  sufficient to cause the RTT phenotype in females, based on the  status of a second gene which, at least in a proportion of cases, may  be abnormal dosage of one or more 15q11 q13 gene.

The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios.

207,11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,,"People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2   gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth  movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects  of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly  conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and  function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak   ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have  been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010,,S.

Many genetic and environmental factors are incriminated in its pathogenesis. Subacute exposure to organophosphates (OPs) during critical periods of prenatal neurodevelopment is one of the factors that may trigger autism. Human serum paraoxonase (PON1)  is a HDL associated hydrolase, which in addition to hydrolyzing the OPs, plays a physiological role in reducing LDL oxidation. The PON1 gene shows two functional polymorphisms: M55L and Q192R. These polymorphisms influence the concentration and activity of PON1 towards different substrates, including OPs.The gene environment interaction is tested in the present study by assessing the distribution and frequency of M55L and Q192R polymorphisms in 58 autistic children and 43 controls.No significant difference (p>0.05) in genotypes distribution was found  between autistic patients and controls (QQ 51.72%, QR 43.1%, RR 5.17% / MM 12.1%, ML 60.3%, LL 27.6% for autistic group and QQ 51.16%, QR 44.18%, RR 4.65% / MM 9.3%, ML 53.5%, LL 37.2% for control group).Although, the paraoxonase activity did not present a significant difference between the patients and controls (p>0.05), there was a significant activity increase in the autistic groups with R allele number and both in autistic and control groups with L allele number (p<0.05). The arylesterase activity was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in autistic patients, with no relation to the number of R alleles, but increased in relation with L allele number (p<0.05).These results provide support for the hypothesis that PON1 arylesterase activity could represent a biochemical/genetic test in  estimating autism risk.",2011,,"E.

We studied the two polymorphic regions :  promoter(5 HTTLPR) with a long or short allele and intron 2 (5  HTTVNTR) with fragments of 9, 10, 12 repeats. Results. There were no differences between the genotype and  allelic frequencies of autistic individuals and control group in both  polymorphisms. With both polymorphisms in patients and controls  there was no prevalence of any specific genotype, but there was a  predominance of the long allele (12 and L).There was no difference  in genotype and allelic frequency between the autistic group versus  mothers, fathers, or mothers and fathers.

151,331,multiple minor congenital defects associated with autism  spectrum disorders,P01.319,,"Autism spectrum disorders represent a wide spectrum of conditions  characterized by abnormalities of social interactions and communica   tion, severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior  .

Minor congenital defects  result from either genetic or environmental causes that act during  pregnancy and are an indirect measure of abnormal embryo and fe   tal development . The purpose of the study was to see if patients with  autism spectrum disorders have more minor congenital defects than  healthy individuals and if so, if this finding correlates with the history of the patients . The incidence and media of minor congenital defects  were determined in 76 patients with autism spectrum disorders and in unrelated control subjects matched by age and sex .

294,1315,PON1 phenotype and gene polymorphisms in children with autism,J09.01,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology.  Many genetic and environmental factors are incriminated in its pathogenesis. Subacute exposure to organophosphates (OPs) during critical periods of prenatal neurodevelopment is one of the factors that may trigger autism. Human serum paraoxonase (PON1)  is a HDL associated hydrolase, which in addition to hydrolyzing the OPs, plays a physiological role in reducing LDL oxidation. The PON1 gene shows two functional polymorphisms: M55L and Q192R. These polymorphisms influence the concentration and activity of PON1 towards different substrates, including OPs.The gene environment interaction is tested in the present study by assessing the distribution and frequency of M55L and Q192R polymorphisms in 58 autistic children and 43 controls.No significant difference (p>0.05) in genotypes distribution was found  between autistic patients and controls (QQ 51.72%, QR 43.1%, RR 5.17% / MM 12.1%, ML 60.3%, LL 27.6% for autistic group and QQ 51.16%, QR 44.18%, RR 4.65% / MM 9.3%, ML 53.5%, LL 37.2% for control group).Although, the paraoxonase activity did not present a significant difference between the patients and controls (p>0.05), there was a significant activity increase in the autistic groups with R allele number and both in autistic and control groups with L allele number (p<0.05). The arylesterase activity was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in autistic patients, with no relation to the number of R alleles, but increased in relation with L allele number (p<0.05).These results provide support for the hypothesis that PON1 arylesterase activity could represent a biochemical/genetic test in  estimating autism risk.",2011,,"E.

The prevalence of ASDs is currently estimated at 60 and 13 per 10,000 for ASDs and autism, respectively. Autistic disorder is often associated with macrocephaly; 24%  of patients have head circumference (HC) at >98th centile. Mutations in the  PTEN gene have been reported in patients with ASDs and significant ma  crocephaly (HC ranging from +2.5 SD to +8 SD). Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing.

Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups.

651,1295, The use of automated facial analysis in the clinical diagnostic of autism spectrum disorders (ASD),P14.005,,"Introduction: Autism can be part of a genetic syndrome associating with dysmorphic features. While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver  Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis   order 1 were identified.

Fluo rescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis with chromosome 7q specificYAC clones showed that the chromosome 7 breakpoint is located betweenmarkers D7S684 and D7S661. The region coincides with the candidateregion for autism on chromosome 7 from previous linkage studies. A BACclone of 82 kb spanning the translocation breakpoint was identified  andthe breakpoint was mapped to 2 kb region within the BAC. Mutationscreening of the 2 genes closest to the breakpoint was performed in a setof 30 autistic patients. We found no sequence variant which predictsaminoacid alteration associated with the phenotype. Two polymorphicnucleotides were identified in one of the genes  and the significance of thepolymorphism in autism remains to be clarified.

The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line.

40,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test  and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and  analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose.

Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples.

316,392, Genetic study of PTEN mutations among individuals with ASDs / MR and macrocephaly,P02.213,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of severe neurodevelopmen tal conditions among which pervasive developmental disorder (not other   wise specified) and autistic disorder are the most common. The prevalence of ASDs is currently estimated at 60 and 13 per 10,000 for ASDs and autism, respectively. Autistic disorder is often associated with macrocephaly; 24%  of patients have head circumference (HC) at >98th centile. Mutations in the  PTEN gene have been reported in patients with ASDs and significant ma  crocephaly (HC ranging from +2.5 SD to +8 SD). Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis. Three novel (p.Asp331Thrfs*11,  p.Thr321Glnfs*23, p.Glu242*) and two known germline mutations  (p.Pro246Leu, p.Arg130*) have been found in 8 of the 53 probands (15%). We discuss possible genotype/phenotype correlation in our group of pati   ents. Our data support former findings that PTEN mutations are frequent  in patients with ASDs and macrocephaly. Therefore PTEN testing should  be considered in such patients. The findings may impact the assessment of  the recurrence risk and medical management of the families including early cancer prevention.

323,460, Brain specific X chromosome aneuploidy is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of autism and can explain the unsolved paradox of male susceptibility,P03.022,,"Autism is a common childhood psychiatric disorder characterized by impai red social interaction and communication, repetitive/stereotypic behavior. Numerous studies indicate that chromosomal and genomic imbalances play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism. However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain   the prime target of the disease   have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex  matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorders, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. Autistic spectrum disorders currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy. Our findings support the hypothesis that somatic genome instability could affect as homeostasis of aneuploid neurons as functioning of the neu ronal network in the whole autistic brain, playing, therefore, an important role in the pathogenesis.

Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study. The  study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German).

A significant association, that over   came the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and permutations was obtained with the marker rs7052177 (p, 6.13e 4). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible participation of PTCHD1 rare variants in ASD and  ID, we are currently performing a mutation screening in the Spanish ASD cohort, and in an additional sample of 200 individuals with ID.

Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists.

95,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples.

Background: The genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates.Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort. The sample contains 161 families ascertained through one or more autistic probands with normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability. The study cohort contains 648 individuals: 227 probands, 324 parents, 97 unaffected siblings belonging to 161 families. All probands, unaffected siblings and parents are genotyped with high resolution Illumina OMNI 2.5 8v1 microarrays. For all individuals, an extensive list of phenotypic information is collected inclu   ding IQ, SRS scores, 3DI, clinical genetic examination and family history.Results:We present the results of a family based study on the validity of CNV de   tection in ASD using a high resolution platform. We study the segregation of known and novel rare CNVs with qualitative and quantitative autism phenotypes. Additionally association studies are performed with respect to amongst others gene content and parental origin.Conclusion:With this study we aim to contribute to the clinical validation of the current knowledge of ASD risk variants and to the identification of novel variants.

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together.

We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother.

Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four  nucleotides in PUF60  (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p.I136Tfs*31). The  patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome. The  case illustrates the strength of exome sequencing in deciphering the genetic basis of diseases.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.",2016,,"M.

The exact aetiology of autism remains speculative, although it is likely to result from a complex combination of multiple non genetic and/or genetic factors. Advances in high resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray tech   nology have revealed sub microscopic aberrations that lead to identification of many disease causing genomic copy number variants (CNVs) in autism. Numerous reports have implicated duplications or deletions of proximal chromosome 15q as significant risk factors for autism and autism related disorders.We report two autistic children with 15q11 13 rearrangements.

Epilepsy occurs in 25% of patients with autism. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) and massively parallel sequencing have identified a large number of genomic regions as well as specific genes which confer suscep   tibility to autism. Six pathogenic copy number variants (4 deletions and 2 duplications) which ranged from 1.3  17.2 Mb and overlapping the HDAC1 gene had been reported. HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, directly interacts with MeCP2 through the transcription co repressor Sin3A/HDAC complex. Mutations in MECP2 cause Rett syndrome; however, no mutations have been described in HDAC1 so far. In a 10 year old boy with non syndromic autism, developmental delay and epilepsy, routine karyotype, CMA, meta bolic, and neuroimaging studies were normal. Whole exome sequencing of ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 173Back to index gDNA from the boy and his parents identified a de novo, novel variant in  HDAC1 (c.154N>S) which was not detected in public or 1100 private exome  databases.

The duplication was detected by Array CGH with clones from the 1 Mb  BAC/PAC clone set (Sanger Institute Hinxton, UK). The aberration was  further delineated to 2.2Mb with a full tiling BAC array. By means of  quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) the breakpoints of the duplication  were mapped and segregation in the family was investigated. qPCR  was used to screen 260 patients with autism for DISC1  duplications. The 2.2Mb duplication was present in the proband, his affected brother  and the apparently unaffected father and paternal grandmother. Since  this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, it was con   sidered as a rare variant. Within this region the most interesting gene  with respect to autism is DISC1  (disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ) since  it is known to be involved in schizophrenia and has recently been as   sociated to autism and bipolar disorder. A group of 260 patients with  autism was studied for the occurrence of DISC1  duplications, but no  additional duplications were found. This study is a typical illustration of the difficult interpretation of causal   ity of a rare variant in neuropsychiatric disease.

Both brothers had inherited an identical 134 Kb  duplication of the regulatory genomic region 0.5 Mb upstream of SOX9  from their mother. In another brother who had inherited the same ma   ternal SOX9 haplotype, no upstream duplication was found, proving  that the mother was a gonadal mosaic for the duplication. We hypoth   esize that the duplication caused sufficient SRY independent SOX9  expression in the undifferentiated fetal gonads to promote testicular  development. Apparently, this effect was tissue  and/or fetal specific as  no SOX9 expression was detectable in leukocytes and skin fibroblasts  from any of the siblings. The observations in the family also suggest  that such a SOX9 regulatory region duplication may predispose for  autism in the presence of a Y chromosome, i.e. a SRY gene. This hy   pothesis is supported by the SOX9 segregation pattern which as a less  than 8,2 % probability of being a random event, and the unexplained  general excess of autistic features in males. We therefore propose that  an additional role of SOX9, directly linked to testicular differentiation,  could be the promotion of male specific brain development. Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders ",2010,,"A.

Recently, copy number variants (CNVâs) have been shown to contribute to over 10% of ASD cases. Many of the known genes whose mutations cause ASD, have functions related to epigenetic regulation. We have applied a custom designed oligo array CGH with an exonic overlapping coverage of 450 genes known to cause autism or intellectual disability and autism candidate genes related to epigenetic machinery.Material and methods: Custom oligonucleotide arrays (formats 4x44 and 8x60) were designed with e Array Agilent technology. The final array design contains: 36,000 exonic probes for 450 genes considered of high priority (mean distance between probes 25bp), 2,000 probes for regulatory ele ments and microRNAâs and 22,000 whole genome probes (backbone).Results: We have studied a series of 139 patients including syndromic au   tism and/or familial cases of idiopathic autism. We have found 24 cases with pathological CNVâs. Most are non recurrent CNV, what allow us to propose new candidate genes involved in autism.Discussion: Our results confirm the importance of three regions in autism: Xq28 (MECP2), 22q13 (SHANK3) and 16q13, while all others regions are extremely heterogeneous.

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of  generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene  hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach  towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with  an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high  resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor   matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes  using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et  al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected:  deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1  (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du  plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83,  RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM   PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and  axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests  generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able  to give further insights into disease pathogenesis.

The  third is a 3 bases deletion variant NM_001080420.1:c.5090_5092delACC (p.(His1697del)) involving the exon 22 in the SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) do   main involved in multimerization of SHANK3 protein. Conclusion: The retrospective clinical examination of these patients did not  permit to distinct specific signs, which highlights the phenotypic hetero  geneity of these patients. Given the scarcity of variants involving SHANK3 ,  the unsystematic presence of the distinctive clinical features of Phelan Mc  Dermid Syndrome, a NGS approach by panel or exome seems more justified  than a targeted sequencing approach of SHANK3  in this phenotype.",2016,,"A.

699,262, Copy number variations (CNVs) of Alzheimer âs disease susceptibility genes in a pediatric clinical cohort,P09.17,,"1Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russian Fed  eration,2Academician Yu.E.

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ï¬ndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the ï¬rstPTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe. This is also the largest pediatriccohort for PTEN prevalence study in patients with ASD and macrocephaly. Materials and methods: PTEN sequencing were done for 128 patients with ASD and head cir cumference size more than 97% on growth charts between the ages of 3 to 18 recruited from ï¬ve different child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in Turkey. Result: We found 2known pathogenic, 1 new pathogenic and 2 variants of insigni ï¬cance (VUS) mutations out of 128 patients. The prevalence is 2,3% (VUS mutations are excluded).

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes.

37,23,The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families. Four regions of linkage were identifi ed  including chromosome 2q (MLS 3.74), 7q (MLS 3.20), 16p (MLS  2.93) and 17q (MLS 2.34), three of which have been replicated by  other groups. Candidate gene and association studies are now in  progress in order to isolate the susceptibility genes at these loci.  On chromosome 7q31, the FOXP2 gene is mutated in a severe  monogenic form of speech and language impairment and encodes a  transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead  domain. FOXP2 was tested for association and mutation in both  complex language impairments and autism.

52,876,Mapping of a Candidate Region for Autism on  Chromosome 2q32.,P0787.,,"Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism,  who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of  chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This  would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of  chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing  gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers  from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This  reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7  megabases.

In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes. The possibility of developing spe   cific alterations of Cowden disease during the second decade should  be considered.

The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups.

The gene is X linked, and about 1 in 350 healthy males of Eu ropean descent have a deletion of exon 2 resulting in inability to synthesize carnitine. TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene  trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed.Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE  deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression.Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males  undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE  case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism.Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti  mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

The aim of this study is to determine a possible association  between polymorphisms 5 HTTVNTR and 5 HTTLPR in serotonin  transporter gene and autism. Materials and Methods. 59 individuals with idiopathic autism,  47mothers, 33 fathers (28nuclear families), 59 controls. Ages  between 3.6 and 41y. We studied the two polymorphic regions :  promoter(5 HTTLPR) with a long or short allele and intron 2 (5  HTTVNTR) with fragments of 9, 10, 12 repeats. Results. There were no differences between the genotype and  allelic frequencies of autistic individuals and control group in both  polymorphisms. With both polymorphisms in patients and controls  there was no prevalence of any specific genotype, but there was a  predominance of the long allele (12 and L).There was no difference  in genotype and allelic frequency between the autistic group versus  mothers, fathers, or mothers and fathers.

540,573, A very common inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis about which little is known,PS06.05,,"Introduction: TMLHE deficiency is a very common inborn error of carnitine  biosynthesis. The gene is X linked, and about 1 in 350 healthy males of Eu ropean descent have a deletion of exon 2 resulting in inability to synthesize carnitine. TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene  trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed.Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE  deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression.Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males  undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE  case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism.Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples. A case study suggests that carnitine supplementation may be useful in treating regressive autism episodes in patients with TMLHE  deficiency. It is unknown if infant males with TMLHE deficiency should re  ceive any dietary modification. It is unknown if there are genetic, dietary, or microbiome factors that influence the development of autism in TMLHE  deficient males.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.ESHG.ORG 131Back to inde x",2015,,"A.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations. Our results can guidedrug development and aid in understanding the pathological spectrum of CASK mutations. M. Becker: None. F. Mastropasqua: None. J.P. Reis  ing: None. I. Rabkina: None. L.

Nowakowska1 1Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland, 2MEDGEN, Warsaw, Poland Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a heterogenous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by problems in social interaction and communication as well as thepresence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviour. It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD. We elected to use oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 275 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high  resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non  polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k). Our study furtherconï¬rmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by the identi ï¬cation of two novel genes: LRRTM4 and DOCK1 as candidate for ASDs. B.

Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples.

In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes.

Patients with mental retardation, cerebral palsy and  autism were evaluated for the presence of minor anomalies. Data were  compared with those obtained from a control group. The frequency of  the minor anomalies was not significantly different in the two groups.  When expressing the mean values as minor anomalies per child, the  figures were 2.92 in affected individuals and 1.43 in the healthy ones. A  positive correlation with the severity of mental retardation was noticed.  64% of the cases with cerebral palsy and 56% of the patients with  autism had at least three minor anomalies.

148,259,cADHERiN 11 as a possible candidate gene for autism,P01.247,,"Child Psychiatry, Leuven,  Belgium, 3University Center for Child and Youth Psychiatry, Antwerp, Belgium. Background: Positional cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in autism  patients is a valuable strategy towards the identification of candidate  genes, especially in isolated autism, and when the aberration is de novo and family history is negative for autism . (1) Objectives:  We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ  of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods:  1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro   scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON   SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat   ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the  AK13094  gene, another was near GFOD  and RANBP10  . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11   gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11  is expressed in  the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses . (2) Interestingly, there is evidence that  altered synaptogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism .  For instance, the cell adhesion molecules NLGN 3  and  4 are impli   cated in autism through their role in the establishment of functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons . (3) Thus, CHD11  represents  both a positional and functional candidate gene for autism . Mutation  screening in a larger cohort of autism patients is ongoing .

157,449,Frequent 22q11 aberrations in patients with non syndromic autism spectrum disorders shown by sNP array based  segmental aneuploidy screening,P02.067,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions  characterized by impaired reciprocal social interaction, communicative  deficits, and restricted behavioral patterns. ASD occurs in syndromic  forms and as non syndromic cases frequently involving cytogenetic abnormalities . Recently, array based genome wide screens have demonstrated frequent copy number variation in non syndromic ASD .  Screening 56 patients with autism and additional major or minor anom   alies with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP platform (Illumina, Inc.,  San Diego, CA) we found in 16 patients 9 regions with deleted and 9 with duplicated signals . Aberrant signals were distributed among 16 distinct chromosomal loci .

The  duplications were confirmed by multiplex ligation mediated probe am   plification and are likely to involve LCRs A, B and D. We conclude that  SNP array based screening of ASD patients uncovers an appreciable  number of CNVs, which in part overlap with loci already discovered by  other approaches.

240,959,Systematic evaluation of the clinical significance of  inherited and de novo copy Number Variations in families with  Autism spectrum Disorders,P09.033,,"Array based studies have detected a wealth of copy number variations  (CNVs) in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Since some  CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini   cal significance of de novo  and inherited CNVs containing genes being  transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive   ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were  grouped into four categories. First, de novo  CNVs in families with both  parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from  a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely  to be causally related to ASD. The genes in these two categories par   ticipate in pathways probably associated with ASD, such as contactin  based cell communication ( CNTN5 , CNTN6 ), phosphoinositol signaling  (PIK3CA ), and regulation of neurotransmitter levels ( KCNMB4 , TPH2 ).  The de novo  CNVs found in patients with at least one parent scoring  higher than 1 SD above the mean on the SRS, and the CNVs inher   ited from an unaffected parent, while the other parent has an elevated  SRS score, are likely to exert a minor contribution to the phenotype.  Our analysis also indicates that in 6 out of 48 ASD patients two or more  genetic etiologies may be involved.

Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an autosomaal recessive disorder  characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, the characteristic neuroradiologic Ã¢ÂÂmolar tooth sign,Ã¢ÂÂ and neurologic symptoms, including dysregulation of breathing and developmental delay. JBTS also includes variable features such as retinal dystrophy and renal  anomalies. Up to 27% of JBTS patients show features of autism. Thus far, 10 genes for JBTS have been identified.

This association of ciliary genes with autism is highly significant (P < 0.001; two sided Fischer exact test). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ciliary genes may be involved in autism, by performing a candidate gene association study with a cohort of 84 patients with autism vs. 145 healthy controls for the 10 known JBTS genes (AHI1,  NPHP1, CEP290, ARL13B, RPGRIP1L, MKS3, CC2D2A, OFD1, TMEM216, and INPP5E).

472,739," M Analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and Rett like features",P08.62,,"Background: Rett syndrome is a severe X linked dominant neurodevelop mental disorder primarily caused by de novo MECP2 mutations. Clinical features include developmental regression at the age of 6 18 months, ac quired microcephaly, autistic behavior, loss or severe impairment of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, gait apraxia, and seizures. CDKL5 mutations have been identified in early onset seizure vari ant and FOXG1 mutations in congenital variant of Rett syndrome. We report the results of mutation analysis of these genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features. Materials and  methods: MECP2 was analyzed in 416 patients, CDKL5 was analyzed in 59 patients, and FOXG1 was analyzed in 20 patients. MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions and duplications were analyzed by MLPA analysis (MRC Holland). Results: Pathogenic mutations  in the MECP2 gene in were identified in 45 patients with classic Rett syn drome, 7 patients with atypical Rett syndrome, 11 patients with Rett like features, and 1 patient with autism. CDKL5 mutations were found in 2 pati   ents with early onset seizures and Rett like phenotype. No FOXG1 mutation was detected in this study. Conclusions:  MECP2 mutations are common in  classic Rett syndrome patients, but they are less frequent in atypical or Rett like phenotypes. However, analysis of MECP2 in these patients should not be discouraged. More patients should be examined to determine frequencies of CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations in Czech Republic.

52,876,Mapping of a Candidate Region for Autism on  Chromosome 2q32.,P0787.,,"Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism,  who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of  chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This  would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of  chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing  gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers  from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This  reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7  megabases. The region contains approximately 16 known genes and  16 ESTs, a number of which are potential candidates for autism.

The co existence of these two traits suggests com mon underlying mechanisms that require further exploration. Copy number variations (CNVs) are excellent candidate to mutually underlie these two di stinct conditions. Methods: We studied the association between CNVs and savant skills among  1108 children diagnosed with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) database. Savant skills were determined based on five designated questions from the autism diagnostic interview revised (ADI R) questionnaire. CNVs  data were retrieved from a genome wide analysis of CNVs in these children. Results: Savant skills were significantly more prevalent in our sample than in other children with ASD in the SSC cohort (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Child   ren with savant skills had, on average, a higher IQ (93.0ÃÂ±24.2 vs. 79.1ÃÂ±25.5; P<0.001), and a larger head circumference (HC) (54.3ÃÂ±2.55 vs. 53.8ÃÂ±2.60; P , 0.003).

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ï¬ndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the ï¬rstPTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe.

The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain.Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi   dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion.In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription. In conclusion, rare sequence variants in CHRNA7 do not significantly contribute to ASD susceptibility, at least in our clinical sample characterized by low frequency of associated medical comorbidity. This study represents the first sequence variant analysis of the CHRNA7 gene in a sample of idiopathic autism.",2014,,"E. Bacchelli1, A. Battaglia2, C. Cameli1, S. Lomartire1, S. Thomson3, J. S.

320,442, A clinical study of patients with pericentromeric deletion and duplication within 16p11.2 p12.2,P03.002,,"The pericentromeric region on 16p is susceptible to chromosomal rearran  gements. There are many reports that deletions of 16p11.2 are observed  about 1% among patients with autism. The 16p11.2 p12.2 deletion syndro  me is characterized by developmental disabilities and dysmorphic features. We have identified pericetromeric deletion and duplication, within 16p11.2 p12.2 in three patients by Cytogenetics 2.7M array. Patient 1 was a 10 year old girl with autism and obesity. She had a heterozygous 593kb deletion in 16p11.2. Her mother with the same deletion was not autistic, but was obese. Patient 2 was a 2 year old boy with VSD, hypotonia, developmental delay and frequent ear infections. He had.dysmorphic features including flat face, down slanting palpebral fissures, low set posteriorly rotated ears and thin upper lip. Autistic features were not seen. Microarray analysis revealed a 7.7Mb deletion at 16p11.2 p12.2. He showed common clinical features to the 16p11.2 p12.2 deletion syndrome. Patient 3 was an 8 year old girl with developmental delay, autism and dysmophic features including hypertri   chosis, wide mouth and macrocephaly. She showed poor communication skills and ritualized patterns of interests and behavior. Microarray analysis revealed a 6.7Mb duplication at 16p11.2 p12.2. The duplicated region of pa tient 3 was very similar with the deleted region of the patient 2. We suggest that 16p11.2 p12.2 duplication may be a new syndrome with autism.",2012,,"N. Okamoto1, K.

667,1881, Autism and seizure in a patient with maternal derived 15q11,P09.07,," Proximal 15q duplications that include the critical region for Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) and angelman syndrome (AS) have been reported in pati   ents with autism. Of the cases of autism reported to have duplications of the PWS/AS critical region, all have been maternal in origin.We describe here a female patient in wich autism segregates with maternal inherance of a proximal 15q duplication. The patient was born at 37 gesta tion weeks with a weigh of 3150 gr. and no incidences in neonatal period. In posterior pediatric revission was detected language and cognitive delayed, supected due to autistic disorder (AD), at 3 years age preseted epilepsy epi sodies. The familiar history include fater and maternal grandmother with epilepsy, maternal uncle with autism and a sister healty.Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH Array) with the Nimblegen CGX Cytogenetic Microarrays platform, suplied by PerkinElmer, was performed for the patient and parentsThe CGH  Array was normal in the father and both mother and patient presented a duplication of 5,56 Mb in 15q11.2 q13.1 PWS/AS region (arr(hg19)15q11.2 q13.1(22,822,019 28,379,369)x3). The Array CGH from grandmother, maternal uncle and sister were no done. This results are according with previous studies that show the correlation between this duplication and autistic disorder when have been maternal in origin. The family history with the maternal uncle diagnosed of autistic dis   order also agree this posibility. The epilepsy, presented in some members  of both families, can be originated for another unknow genetics alteration,  without any correlation with the PSW/AS region. E",2016,,"M. Martinez Atienza, S.
