Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together. Conclusion: Autistic individuals with higher genetic burden for the disorder, including large rare CNVs andhigher load of PRS, have different bene ï¬ts of SSGT com  pared with individuals with lower genetic risk. Our results can aid in personalized intervention modi ï¬cations for ASD in the future. D. Li: None. I. Rabkina: None. S. Stamouli: None. H. Jiao: None. M. Becker: None. U. Jonsson: None. N.

The number in Bulgaria is currently unknown. But the hospitalizationof patients with speech, hearing and communication problems has  increased in the past 10 years. Our experience in clinical genetics proved that childhood autism is a heterogeneous syndrome. The aim of our work was to analyze children with autism for mitochondrial DNA mutations and discuss the possibility of their treatment. We made clinical and laboratory investigations and sequenced mt DNA regions in peripheral blood by the PCR SBT method in 4 of our patients with autism.We found different mt DNA mutations and polymorphisms. In a girl suspected for Rett syndrome we found G6852A in mt CO1,which  changed Gly>Ser. In the 3 boys with autism we found the polymorphism T4216C (connected with predisposition to LHON or insulin resistance) in the first,the polymorphism G9055A (protective of Parkinson disease) in the second, and a polymorphism connected with predisposition to LHON in the third.

We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p.Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family. A functional test of HUWE1   activity on DNA repair is currently performed on patientâs cells to confirm its pathogenicity.  Y. Alembik: None. J. Lauer Zillhardt:  None. B. Gerard: None. C.

2669,704, Characterization of patient with de novo frameshift PUF60 mutation suggests that disruption of this gene is sufficient for most symptoms of Verheij syndrome,P08.72,,"Verheij syndrome (OMIM 615583) is associated with rare de novo 8q24.3  microdeletions. Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce   phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial   ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60  and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense  PUF60  mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked  coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60  and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced  different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome.We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip.

The  patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome.

1493,689, 20 ans aprÃ¨s: a second family with mutation in X linked monoamine oxidase A gene affecting cognition and behavior,P05.109,,"Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an extraordinary genetic he terogeneity, with more than 200 genes implicated in monogenic forms. This complexity precluded systematic testing for mutations and because clini cal features are often non specific, for some of these genes only few cases or families have been unambiguously documented. It is the case of the the X linked gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), for which only one nonsense mutation has been identified in Brunner syndrome, characterized in one unique family by borderline ID and impulsive and aggressive behavi ors. We have developed targeted NGS sequencing of 220 ID genes in patients with undiagnosed ID. We identified a p.C266F missense mutation in MAOA in a boy with autistic features and behavioral disturbances. He has good ver   bal comprehension but IQ could not be measured due to attention deficit and heterogeneous results in WISC IV test. Two maternal uncles carry the mutation and have severe ID, with a history of maltreatment in early child hood. The phenotype overlaps with Brunner syndrome. This novel missense mutation decreases MAOA activity, as shown by abnormal levels of urinary monoamines and by measurement of enzymatic activity. The identification of this point mutation confirms, for the first time since 1993, the monogenic implication of the MAOA gene in ID, autistic features and behavioral abnor malities. Variable expressivity might be due to environmental factors. We will discuss possible therapeutic options and hypotheses that could account for the very long time lag between the initial and highly publicized report and the finding of a second family.  A.

Itis characterised by difficulties in social interaction and stereotyped behav iour but in contrast to infantile autism by normal intelligence and usuallynormal language skills. In the pediatric age group the prevalence ofAsperger syndrome is around 4 7/1000 whereas the corresponding figurefor the infantile autism is 4/10000. Etiopathogenesis is unknown but thereis evidence for a strong genetic component. Based on clinical observationsAS is inherited in the same families as infantile autism but also as a sepa rate entity often transmitted from male to male. We report the analysis of13 candidate gene loci associated with autism and schizophrenia in 17Finnish AS families with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Linkageto the previously reported predisposing loci for autism could not be repli cated with Finnish AS families.

The exact aetiology of autism remains speculative, although it is likely to result from a complex combination of multiple non genetic and/or genetic factors. Advances in high resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray tech   nology have revealed sub microscopic aberrations that lead to identification of many disease causing genomic copy number variants (CNVs) in autism.

Epilepsy occurs in 25% of patients with autism. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) and massively parallel sequencing have identified a large number of genomic regions as well as specific genes which confer suscep   tibility to autism. Six pathogenic copy number variants (4 deletions and 2 duplications) which ranged from 1.3  17.2 Mb and overlapping the HDAC1 gene had been reported. HDAC1, a histone deacetylase, directly interacts with MeCP2 through the transcription co repressor Sin3A/HDAC complex. Mutations in MECP2 cause Rett syndrome; however, no mutations have been described in HDAC1 so far. In a 10 year old boy with non syndromic autism, developmental delay and epilepsy, routine karyotype, CMA, meta bolic, and neuroimaging studies were normal.

However, the interpre   tation is not always straightforward. We describe the identification and delineation of a 2.2Mb microdupli   cation in 1q42.2 in 2 brothers with autism and mild mental retardation. The duplication was detected by Array CGH with clones from the 1 Mb  BAC/PAC clone set (Sanger Institute Hinxton, UK). The aberration was  further delineated to 2.2Mb with a full tiling BAC array. By means of  quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) the breakpoints of the duplication  were mapped and segregation in the family was investigated. qPCR  was used to screen 260 patients with autism for DISC1  duplications. The 2.2Mb duplication was present in the proband, his affected brother  and the apparently unaffected father and paternal grandmother. Since  this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, it was con   sidered as a rare variant. Within this region the most interesting gene  with respect to autism is DISC1  (disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ) since  it is known to be involved in schizophrenia and has recently been as   sociated to autism and bipolar disorder. A group of 260 patients with  autism was studied for the occurrence of DISC1  duplications, but no  additional duplications were found. This study is a typical illustration of the difficult interpretation of causal   ity of a rare variant in neuropsychiatric disease.

Both brothers had inherited an identical 134 Kb  duplication of the regulatory genomic region 0.5 Mb upstream of SOX9  from their mother. In another brother who had inherited the same ma   ternal SOX9 haplotype, no upstream duplication was found, proving  that the mother was a gonadal mosaic for the duplication. We hypoth   esize that the duplication caused sufficient SRY independent SOX9  expression in the undifferentiated fetal gonads to promote testicular  development. Apparently, this effect was tissue  and/or fetal specific as  no SOX9 expression was detectable in leukocytes and skin fibroblasts  from any of the siblings. The observations in the family also suggest  that such a SOX9 regulatory region duplication may predispose for  autism in the presence of a Y chromosome, i.e. a SRY gene. This hy   pothesis is supported by the SOX9 segregation pattern which as a less  than 8,2 % probability of being a random event, and the unexplained  general excess of autistic features in males. We therefore propose that  an additional role of SOX9, directly linked to testicular differentiation,  could be the promotion of male specific brain development. Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders ",2010,,"A.

Genetic and cytogenetic studies revealed that most of the chromosomes are associated with autism, abnormalities of  chromosomes 15 and X being most frequently documented. AIM OF THE STUDY: Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood samples from children with autism was performed to identify possible structural or nume rical chromosomal abnormalities by GTG banding. RESULTS: The study revealed normal karyotypes in most cases (47 out of  50 individuals). Two of the male patients had modified karyotypes (2% mo saicism): chromosome 9qh+ polymorphism and terminal deletion on chro  mosome 15q, respectively. One of the female patients had an extra chromo  some 8 (2% mosaicism).CONCLUSION: This is the first cytogenetic testing performed specifically on  autistic children in Romania.

Recently, copy number variants (CNVâs) have been shown to contribute to over 10% of ASD cases. Many of the known genes whose mutations cause ASD, have functions related to epigenetic regulation. We have applied a custom designed oligo array CGH with an exonic overlapping coverage of 450 genes known to cause autism or intellectual disability and autism candidate genes related to epigenetic machinery.Material and methods: Custom oligonucleotide arrays (formats 4x44 and 8x60) were designed with e Array Agilent technology. The final array design contains: 36,000 exonic probes for 450 genes considered of high priority (mean distance between probes 25bp), 2,000 probes for regulatory ele ments and microRNAâs and 22,000 whole genome probes (backbone).Results: We have studied a series of 139 patients including syndromic au   tism and/or familial cases of idiopathic autism. We have found 24 cases with pathological CNVâs. Most are non recurrent CNV, what allow us to propose new candidate genes involved in autism.Discussion: Our results confirm the importance of three regions in autism: Xq28 (MECP2), 22q13 (SHANK3) and 16q13, while all others regions are extremely heterogeneous.

To succeed, we have proposed an original bioinformatic strategy of CNV/gene prioritization by rating data acquired from clinical, cytogenetic and genomic variation da tabases and by means of bioinformatic tools for genome, epigenome and pathway analysis. To test the strategy, we have evaluated the Russian co hort of children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and congeni tal anomalies (116 individuals; partially described in Iourov I.Y. et al.

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of  generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene  hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach  towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with  an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high  resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor   matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes  using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et  al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected:  deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1  (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du  plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83,  RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM   PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and  axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests  generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able  to give further insights into disease pathogenesis.

The origins of somatic genome variations manifesting as structural chro mosomal rearrangements remain largely unknown. However, it is generally  accepted that susceptibility to structural chromosome aberrations can be  produced by alterations to DNA sequences flanking the breakpoints or to rearranged chromosomal regions (i.e. CNV). Addressing genome variations  in children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital  malformations (n,200) by high resolution CNV analysis (molecular karyo typing; resolution: 1 kbp or higher), we have surprisingly found that somatic structural chromosome abnormalities can co occur with non mosaic ones  within the same loci. More precisely, we detected 8 cases (4%) (4 dupli  cations and 4 deletions) demonstrating small non mosaic structural chro mosome rearrangements encompassed by larger mosaic ones. The dupli  cations were mosaic dup3p26.3p26.1 (5.8 Mb) vs. regular dup3p26.1 (2.9  Mb); mosaic dup14q32.13q32.2 (4.5 Mb) vs. regular dup14q32.2 (1.8 Mb); mosaic dup17p13.1p11.2 (6.9 Mb) vs. regular dup17p12 (1.4 Mb); mosaic  dup18p11.32p11.31 (5.3 Mb) vs. regular dup18p11.32p11.31 (4.8 Mb). The  deletions were mosaic del5q35.1q35.3 (9.2 Mb) vs. regular del5q35.2q35.3 (2.3 Mb); mosaic del14q11.2 (2.2 Mb) vs. regular del14q11.2 (0.5 Mb); mo saic del15q13.1q14 (8.2 Mb) vs. regular del15q13.2q13.3 (2 Mb); mosaic  delXp22.32p22.2 (4.7 Mb) vs. regular delXp22.31 (0.7 Mb). These findings  allowed us to hypothesize small regular structural variations (CNV) to be able to produce locus specific constitutional chromosome instability resul  ting in larger somatic rearrangements. Our speculations are also suppor  ted by previous communications reporting specific local genomic changes to underlie common microdeletions/microduplications at several of the  aforementioned loci.

However, parents may not know about their consanguinity. As a re sult, clinical genetic evaluation is unable to provide a preliminary diagnosis for performing targeted molecular genetic diagnosis. Fortunately, there do exist whole genome scanning techniques making possible to detect not only genomic but also epigenomic variations (i.e. segmental loss of heterozygo sity or SLOH) for evaluating levels of consanguinity. Here, we have analyzed genomes of 188 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformations using SNP/oligonucleotide molecular karyoty   ping (Affymetrix) and an original bioinformatic technology for addressing phenotypic, cellular and molecular consequences of genomic/epigenomic variations. SLOH, specific to clinical manifestations in these children, were found in 6 cases (3.2%). It is to note that parental consanguinity was not initially reported in all these cases. In one child, Meier Gorlin syndrome was diagnosed. Other cases were also associated with hereditary diseases. Two cases of SLOH indirectly related to the phenotype were associated with mi crodeletions in 14q22.1 and 15q15.2, respectively. Parental consanguinity has long been considered as a source of knowledge about origins of here ditary diseases. In the present study, the possibility of genetic analyses of children born in consanguineous marriages has been extended by whole genome and bioinformatic analyses. Actually, it has been shown that sur prisingly detected consanguinity can be relatively common and molecular diagnosis using SNP arrays and bioinformatics can be useful for revealing of mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic diseases.

2680,743, The power of New Generation Sequencing in identifying mutations in non specific ASD ID phenotypes: the example of SHANK3,P09.019,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by im  pairments in reciprocal social communication and stereotyped behaviors.  Intellectual Disability (ID) frequently coexists with these two core sym  ptoms. Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3  concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo  derate to profound ID. SHANK3  haploinsufficiency is frequently associated  with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs  to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing  of this gene.Materials and Methods: Here we report on 2 boys with ASD and ID and a girl  with severe ID associated with a SHANK3  mutation found by next generation  sequencing (NGS) study (Illumina). Results: Two of these mutations are truncated and de novo involving the  exon 21 in the prolin rich domain (NM_001080420.1:c.2955_2970dup  (p.(Pro992Arg*325) and NM_001080420.1:c.4381C>T (p.(Gln1461*)).

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ï¬ndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the ï¬rstPTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe. This is also the largest pediatriccohort for PTEN prevalence study in patients with ASD and macrocephaly. Materials and methods: PTEN sequencing were done for 128 patients with ASD and head cir cumference size more than 97% on growth charts between the ages of 3 to 18 recruited from ï¬ve different child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in Turkey. Result: We found 2known pathogenic, 1 new pathogenic and 2 variants of insigni ï¬cance (VUS) mutations out of 128 patients. The prevalence is 2,3% (VUS mutations are excluded).

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes. Collectively, the cross disorder rCNV maps and metrics derived here set the foundation for future studies of dosage sensitivity throughout the human genome.",2021,,R.L. Collins: None. J.T.

134,23,The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families. Four regions of linkage were identifi ed  including chromosome 2q (MLS 3.74), 7q (MLS 3.20), 16p (MLS  2.93) and 17q (MLS 2.34), three of which have been replicated by  other groups. Candidate gene and association studies are now in  progress in order to isolate the susceptibility genes at these loci.  On chromosome 7q31, the FOXP2 gene is mutated in a severe  monogenic form of speech and language impairment and encodes a  transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead  domain. FOXP2 was tested for association and mutation in both  complex language impairments and autism. No association or coding  region variants in FOXP2 were found and the gene is therefore  unlikely to play a major role in autism or more common forms of  language impairment.",2002,,"Monaco1, IMGSAC2, SLIC3","1Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford,  Oxford, United Kingdom, 2The International Molecular Genetic Study  of Autism Consortium (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~maestrin/iat.html),  United Kingdom, 3The Specific Language Impairment Consortium  (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/monaco/dianne/index.shtml), United  Kingdom.",83 sibling pairs families with autism were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a further 69 sibling pair families.,family with autism,
184,876,Mapping of a Candidate Region for Autism on  Chromosome 2q32.,P0787.,,"Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism,  who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of  chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This  would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of  chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing  gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers  from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This  reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7  megabases.

Although 10 20% of ASD cases are known to be  caused by rare high penetrance mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities,  and de novo DNA copy number variation, genome wide association  studies (GWAS) with large sample sizes have also revealed common  genetic variants associated with ASDs.

Genotype phenotype correla   tion showed that patients with mutations in the 5ÃÂ´ region of exon 18 leading to loss of both domains suffer from GPS, while patients with mutations in the 3ÃÂ´ region leading to loss of the TA domain suffer from SBBYSS.We present an 8 year old girl with intellectual disability, autism and multip   le developmental anomalies. She has corpus callosum agenesis, flexion con tractures, hypoplastic patella, renal cysts and tracheomalacia (symptoms frequent in GPS but rare in SBBYSS), as well as blepharophimosis, lacrimal ducts stenosis, long toes, hypotonia and normal head circumference (fre quent in SYBBYSS but rare in GPS) and atrial septal defect, feeding difficul   ties and bulbous nose (common to both syndromes).Karyotyping and aCGH analysis of the patient yielded normal results. Who le exome and Sanger sequencing of the family trio showed de novo hetero zygous truncating mutation KAT6B:NM_001256469:exon18:c.3295G>T:p.E1099X located in the 5ÃÂ´ region of exon 18, which should cause GPS. Howe ver, our patient manifests also many features of SBBYSS. Therefore this case demonstrates that the phenotypic overlap between GPS and SBBYSS could be broader than expected previously.Supported by 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.100/24022 and NT/14200.",2014,,"M.

In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes. The possibility of developing spe   cific alterations of Cowden disease during the second decade should  be considered.

Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs.

In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups.

The gene is X linked, and about 1 in 350 healthy males of Eu ropean descent have a deletion of exon 2 resulting in inability to synthesize carnitine. TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene  trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed.Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE  deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression.Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males  undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE  case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism.Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples.

Rappold1 1Department of Human Molecular Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,2Institute of Physiology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany,3Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but these symptoms are often overlooked and it is still not clear how GI dysfunction relates to the core features of ASD.FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectualdisability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano  metry. Several Foxp1 targets previously identi ï¬ed by microarray analysis in the brain were signi ï¬cantly deregu  lated in the oesophagus of Foxp1 +/  mice. The total gut transit was signi ï¬cantly prolonged. Spatiotemporal maps depicting the colonic contraction patterns revealed strongly disturbed contractility and peristalsis. Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism spectrum disorder may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1  dependent deregulation of genes.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti  mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

We studied the two polymorphic regions :  promoter(5 HTTLPR) with a long or short allele and intron 2 (5  HTTVNTR) with fragments of 9, 10, 12 repeats. Results. There were no differences between the genotype and  allelic frequencies of autistic individuals and control group in both  polymorphisms. With both polymorphisms in patients and controls  there was no prevalence of any specific genotype, but there was a  predominance of the long allele (12 and L).There was no difference  in genotype and allelic frequency between the autistic group versus  mothers, fathers, or mothers and fathers.

2134,573, A very common inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis about which little is known,PS06.05,,"Introduction: TMLHE deficiency is a very common inborn error of carnitine  biosynthesis. The gene is X linked, and about 1 in 350 healthy males of Eu ropean descent have a deletion of exon 2 resulting in inability to synthesize carnitine. TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene  trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed.Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE  deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression.Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males  undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE  case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism.Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples. A case study suggests that carnitine supplementation may be useful in treating regressive autism episodes in patients with TMLHE  deficiency. It is unknown if infant males with TMLHE deficiency should re  ceive any dietary modification.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations. Our results can guidedrug development and aid in understanding the pathological spectrum of CASK mutations. M. Becker: None. F. Mastropasqua: None. J.P. Reis  ing: None. I. Rabkina: None. L.

Nowakowska1 1Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland, 2MEDGEN, Warsaw, Poland Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a heterogenous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by problems in social interaction and communication as well as thepresence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviour. It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD. We elected to use oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 275 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high  resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non  polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k). Our study furtherconï¬rmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by the identi ï¬cation of two novel genes: LRRTM4 and DOCK1 as candidate for ASDs. B.

Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples.

In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes.

Background: Positional cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in autism  patients is a valuable strategy towards the identification of candidate  genes, especially in isolated autism, and when the aberration is de novo and family history is negative for autism . (1) Objectives:  We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ  of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods:  1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro   scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON   SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat   ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the  AK13094  gene, another was near GFOD  and RANBP10  . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11   gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11  is expressed in  the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses . (2) Interestingly, there is evidence that  altered synaptogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism .  For instance, the cell adhesion molecules NLGN 3  and  4 are impli   cated in autism through their role in the establishment of functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons .

ASD occurs in syndromic  forms and as non syndromic cases frequently involving cytogenetic abnormalities . Recently, array based genome wide screens have demonstrated frequent copy number variation in non syndromic ASD .  Screening 56 patients with autism and additional major or minor anom   alies with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP platform (Illumina, Inc.,  San Diego, CA) we found in 16 patients 9 regions with deleted and 9 with duplicated signals . Aberrant signals were distributed among 16 distinct chromosomal loci .

The  duplications were confirmed by multiplex ligation mediated probe am   plification and are likely to involve LCRs A, B and D. We conclude that  SNP array based screening of ASD patients uncovers an appreciable  number of CNVs, which in part overlap with loci already discovered by  other approaches. Our finding that 3 out of 56 ASD patients carried aberrations within the 22q11 region is highly unexpected .

860,959,Systematic evaluation of the clinical significance of  inherited and de novo copy Number Variations in families with  Autism spectrum Disorders,P09.033,,"Array based studies have detected a wealth of copy number variations  (CNVs) in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Since some  CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini   cal significance of de novo  and inherited CNVs containing genes being  transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive   ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were  grouped into four categories. First, de novo  CNVs in families with both  parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from  a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely  to be causally related to ASD. The genes in these two categories par   ticipate in pathways probably associated with ASD, such as contactin  based cell communication ( CNTN5 , CNTN6 ), phosphoinositol signaling  (PIK3CA ), and regulation of neurotransmitter levels ( KCNMB4 , TPH2 ).  The de novo  CNVs found in patients with at least one parent scoring  higher than 1 SD above the mean on the SRS, and the CNVs inher   ited from an unaffected parent, while the other parent has an elevated  SRS score, are likely to exert a minor contribution to the phenotype.  Our analysis also indicates that in 6 out of 48 ASD patients two or more  genetic etiologies may be involved. This study extends the scope of  genome wide CNV profiling beyond de novo  CNVs in sporadic patients,  and may constitute a first step toward uncovering the missing heritability  in genome wide screening studies of complex psychiatric disorders .Complex traits and polygenic disorders22",2010,,"M.

Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an autosomaal recessive disorder  characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, the characteristic neuroradiologic Ã¢ÂÂmolar tooth sign,Ã¢ÂÂ and neurologic symptoms, including dysregulation of breathing and developmental delay. JBTS also includes variable features such as retinal dystrophy and renal  anomalies. Up to 27% of JBTS patients show features of autism. Thus far, 10 genes for JBTS have been identified. The ciliary gene AHI1  has been found mutated in 7 to 16% of cases with JBTS. On the other hand, of the 39 genes associated with autism, 29 (74%) encode ciliary genes. This association of ciliary genes with autism is highly significant (P < 0.001; two sided Fischer exact test). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ciliary genes may be involved in autism, by performing a candidate gene association study with a cohort of 84 patients with autism vs. 145 healthy controls for the 10 known JBTS genes (AHI1,  NPHP1, CEP290, ARL13B, RPGRIP1L, MKS3, CC2D2A, OFD1, TMEM216, and INPP5E).

1687,2229,Microarray Comparative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients with autism or autistic spectrum disorders,J18.03,,"Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, Athens, Greece. Aim: Autism or autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are a lifelong neurode   velopmental disorder and Î± few cases of chromosomal abnormalities are  found by conventional cytogenetic techniques, while the microarray Compa  rative Genomic Hybridization analysis (array CGH) allows the identification of submicroscopic genomic rearrangements. This study describes the ap  plication of array CGH, as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients  with autism or ASD. Materials  Methods: During the last 4 years, 88/480 patients were studied with autism or ASD of unknown aetiology but with normal previous con ventional karyotype and other genetic tests. High resolution 4X180K and  1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro  bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar  dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51). CNVs  detected were in loci at high risk for autism: 2q37.2, 2p16.3, 5p15.32p14.3,  7p22.3, 10q26.3, 12q24.22q24.3, 15q11.2q11.3, 16p11.2, 18q22.3q23, 21q22.3, Î§q21.31.

1774,739," M Analysis of MECP2, CDKL5, and FOXG1 genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and Rett like features",P08.62,,"Background: Rett syndrome is a severe X linked dominant neurodevelop mental disorder primarily caused by de novo MECP2 mutations. Clinical features include developmental regression at the age of 6 18 months, ac quired microcephaly, autistic behavior, loss or severe impairment of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, gait apraxia, and seizures. CDKL5 mutations have been identified in early onset seizure vari ant and FOXG1 mutations in congenital variant of Rett syndrome. We report the results of mutation analysis of these genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features. Materials and  methods: MECP2 was analyzed in 416 patients, CDKL5 was analyzed in 59 patients, and FOXG1 was analyzed in 20 patients. MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions and duplications were analyzed by MLPA analysis (MRC Holland). Results: Pathogenic mutations  in the MECP2 gene in were identified in 45 patients with classic Rett syn drome, 7 patients with atypical Rett syndrome, 11 patients with Rett like features, and 1 patient with autism. CDKL5 mutations were found in 2 pati   ents with early onset seizures and Rett like phenotype. No FOXG1 mutation was detected in this study. Conclusions:  MECP2 mutations are common in  classic Rett syndrome patients, but they are less frequent in atypical or Rett like phenotypes. However, analysis of MECP2 in these patients should not be discouraged. More patients should be examined to determine frequencies of CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations in Czech Republic.

Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen   tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members.Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen   de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy   potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website.This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare diseases affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes.

184,876,Mapping of a Candidate Region for Autism on  Chromosome 2q32.,P0787.,,"Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism,  who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of  chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This  would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of  chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing  gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers  from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This  reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7  megabases. The region contains approximately 16 known genes and  16 ESTs, a number of which are potential candidates for autism.

Despite a wide variety of available data, speci ï¬c biological processes underlying abnormal neurodevelopment remain to be unmasked. Here, we have used molecular cytogenetic data to analyze speci ï¬c pathways leading to neuropsychiatric diseases in children. Materials and Methods: Conventional and molecular karyotyping was used to evaluate 427 patients with idiopathic intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, andcongenital malformations. An original bioinformatic tech  nique based on candidate process prioritization (Iourov et al., 2014; Yurov et al., 2017) was applied to pathwayenrichment among these patients. Results: Molecular cytogenetic analysis has shown CNVs relevant to a pathway functional change in 397children (93%). The highest enrichment rates (gene percentage among all the prioritized candidate genes/ processes) were found for the following pathways: cellcycle (4.68%), MAPK signaling (6.56%), pathways in cancer (11.94%), DNA replication (1.64%). All the children exhibiting the genomic variations altering genes involved inthese pathways were found to present with chromosome instability (mosaic aneuploidy, chromosome breaks/fragi  lity, non speci ï¬c structural chromosomal rearrangements), whereas the remainder was not demonstrating de ï¬nable chromosome instability. Conclusions: Alterations to pathways associated with genome/chromosome stability maintenance through the cell cycle were shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. The consequences of the altera tions were found to be detectable at chromosomal level. These data supports a previously proposed hypothesis describing two /multiple hits to genome stability as apossible mechanism of neuropsychiatric diseases (Iourov et al., 2013).

The main features of patients with an 8q21.11 deletion encompassing this gene are intellectualdisability, hypotonia, short stature, and a peculiar facial pheno type. Corneal opacity has been frequently reported and some of the subjects also show a wide range of severe eye abnormalities. Case report: We describe a female patient with mild intellectualdisability and autism spectrum disorder. She had brachycephaly with ï¬at occiput, wide forehead, strabismus, monolateral ptosis, epicanthic folds, low set, prominent, posteriorly rotated ears, longand smooth philtrum, thin lips, high arched palate, microretrog nathia, short 4 thand 5thmetacarpal bones, lumbar hyperlordosis. Clinical Exome Sequencing revealed the presence of the hetero zygous de novo pathogenic variant c.3093 +1G>T in the ZFHX4 gene. This variant is located in a canonical donor splice site,suggesting a possible alteration of the splicing process and a loss of protein function. Conclusions: Severe eye abnormalities occur with a high frequency in patients with large 8q21.11 deletions. They range from Peters anomaly to cataract, microphthalmia, sclerocornea, corneal opacity, pigmentary retina degeneration. None of theseabnormalities have been reported in patients with ZFHX4 point mutations, intragenic deletions, or small deletions encompassing only ZFHX4 . We propose that ZFHX4 loss of function is associated with an autosomal dominant condition, characterized by aneurobehavioural phenotype and a recognizable pattern of facialfeatures.

It varies from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifesta tions and an increased risk of toxicity from 5  ï¬uorouracil treatment. Materials and Methods: A child with severe autistic behavior, intellectual disability (no speech at 6 years old) and family history   aunt with mental retardation, was referred for genetic counseling. Metabolic screening wasperformed in urine sample by dipstick   glucose, ketone, pH, and reducing sugars, followed by LC MS/MS blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines and GC/MS urine organicacids analysis. Mutations in DPYD gene are reported in DPD de ï¬ciency patients. The gene was investigated by direct Sanger sequencing in proband and his parents. Results: Elevated levels of thymine and uracil were detected by GC/MS urine test which was suggestive of DPD deï¬ciency. Molecular analysis of DPYD gene showed a homozygous splice site mutation c.1905 +1G>A in the proband, inherited from heterozygous parents. Subse  quently, prenatal testing in the family was performed. Thefetus was healthy non carrier. Conclusion: Here we report the ï¬rst Bulgarian patient with severe autistic disorder caused by DPD de ï¬ciency and subsequent prenatal diagnostics performed in the family. As patients with this de ï¬ciency could be easily detected by determination of the thymine uraciluria, screening for thesedefects are indicative for all patients with any autistic behavior and intellectual disability.

The co existence of these two traits suggests com mon underlying mechanisms that require further exploration. Copy number variations (CNVs) are excellent candidate to mutually underlie these two di stinct conditions. Methods: We studied the association between CNVs and savant skills among  1108 children diagnosed with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) database. Savant skills were determined based on five designated questions from the autism diagnostic interview revised (ADI R) questionnaire. CNVs  data were retrieved from a genome wide analysis of CNVs in these children. Results: Savant skills were significantly more prevalent in our sample than in other children with ASD in the SSC cohort (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Child   ren with savant skills had, on average, a higher IQ (93.0ÃÂ±24.2 vs. 79.1ÃÂ±25.5; P<0.001), and a larger head circumference (HC) (54.3ÃÂ±2.55 vs. 53.8ÃÂ±2.60; P , 0.003). Interestingly, savant skills were associated with a lower count  of rare CNVs among children with ASD (14.0ÃÂ±5.54 vs. 14.8ÃÂ±6.2 for children  with and without savant skills respectively; P , 0.03). In addition, children with exceptional computational ability had lower burden of rare deletions compared to other children (203.46ÃÂ±164.25kb vs. 333.67ÃÂ±715.56kb; P ,  6.8x10 5) even after accounting for IQ and socioeconomic status.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ï¬ndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the ï¬rstPTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe.

The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain.Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi   dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion.In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription.

The haplotypes TGC and TCC presented a signi ficantly higher frequency in cases and the odds documented nearly 3 3.47  fold higher risk to the disease in carriers of the haplotypes [OR,3.0 (1.16  7.79), OR,3.47 (0.95 12.63), respectively].

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder  associated with loss of maternal gene expression in chromosome  region 15q11 q13 due to either maternal deletion, paternal  uniparental disomy (UPD), imprinting defect, mutation in the UBE3A   gene or unidentified mechanism(s). UBE3A  encodes an ubiquitin  protein ligase and shows brain specific imprinting. We have analysed  the UBE3A  coding region in ten AS patients with a normal biparental  inheritance and normal DNA methylation pattern at 15q11 q13. Methods.  For screening of mutations both CSGE (conformation  sensitive gel electrophoresis) and sequencing were used. Results.  A disease causing mutation was identified in five of the  patients: two novel missense mutations (902A >C, 975T >C)  and three deletions (1930delAG in one and 3093delAAGA in two  patients).

419,1234,Evaluation of ms mLPA for molecular diagnosis of  Prader Willi and Angelman syndrome in a clinical context,P1218.,,"Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) are distinct syndromes  characterized by developmental impairment, caused by loss of  expression of imprinted genes in the paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) chromosomal region 15q11 q13 . Molecular genetic testing is important  to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to predict the familial recurrence  risk which depends on the underlying molecular mechanism [deletion  (in 75% of PWS and AS cases), uniparental disomy (UPD), an imprinting error or point mutations] . In most diagnostic laboratories methylation specific PCR or Southern blot analysis is used . Additional testing (FISH, UPD analysis) is required to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism . An ideal molecular test  should provide information about both parent specific methylation imprinting on 15q11 q13 and the underlying genetic mechanism .  Recently, methylation specific multiplex ligation dependent probe  amplification (MS MLPA) became commercially available. This  technique allows detection of changes in CpG methylation and copy number of chromosomal sequences in a single reaction . We evaluated this technique for diagnostic applications in a clinical setting . Using MS MLPA we tested a group of 16 patients with  previously confirmed PWS (7) and AS (9) respectively. The molecular  diagnosis and underlying molecular mechanism were confirmed in all cases . A comparison was made between MS MLPA and Southern blot results . We conclude that MS MLPA is a powerful technique, suitable for molecular diagnostics of PWS/AS in a clinical context .  MS MLPA has important advantages compared to other techniques  as starting from genomic DNA, information about methylation status  and underlying molecular mechanism is provided within in a single experiment, resulting in a shorter turnover time .",2006,,"Claes , K.

461,440,Frequency of mosaic aneuploidy in children with  idiopathic autism,P0303.,,"It has been repeatedly suggested that numerous human diseases in   cluding major psychiatric disorders could be associated with mosaic  aneuploidy. Here, we have attempted to test this hypothesis concern   ing autism, a common childhood psychiatric disorder. About 5 10% of  autism cases are known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities  or gene mutations. However, mosaic aneuploidy in autism has not ever  been studied. We surveyed stochastic aneuploidy in children with/with   out idiopathic autism by interphase multiprobe fluorescence in situ hy   bridization (mFISH). The rate of chromosome loss and gain involving  six arbitrarily selected autosomes (chromosomes 1, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18)  and sex chromosomes was assessed in peripheral blood cells of 60  unaffected male children and 116 male children with idiopathic autism.  Studying over 420,000 cells, we have determined the mean frequency  of stochastic aneuploidy in control and autism: Control Chromosome loss Chromosome gain Autosomes   Sex chromosomes0.58% (95% CI 0.42 0.75%)   _0.15% (95% CI 0.09 0.21%)   1.11% (95% CI 0.90 1.31%) Autism Autosomes   Sex chromosomes0.60% (95% CI 0.37 0.83%)   _0.22% (95% CI 0.14 0.30%)   1.01% (95% CI 0.85 1.17%) CI   confidence interval The difference of stochastic aneuploidy rate was insignificant. However, the frequency  of mosaic aneuploidy over the background level was found in 19 (16%) of 116 children  with idiopathic autism, while outlier values were not found in controls. These data  identify mosaic aneuploidy as a new autism genetic risk factor. Therefore, molecular  cytogenetic analysis of somatic mosaicism is warranted in children with idiopathic au   tism.

Here, we have identified different novel mutations in the  FGFR2 gene in the last two outstanding Apert patients with unidenti   fied mutation from a cohort of 227 patients. One is a 1.9 kb deletion,  removing the entire exon IIIc of the gene and substantial portions of  the flanking introns. This is the first large FGFR2 deletion described in any patient with craniosynostosis . The other mutation is a  de novo   Alu insertion into the IIIc exon of FGFR2. This is the third identified  AS related Alu insertion within 105 bp of sequence, a remarkable en   richment considering that only ~30 new Alu insertions have been de   scribed in all human diseases . Computational analysis revealed that  the inserted Alu element belongs to a new subfamily, not previously  known to be mobile, which we characterize and term Alu Yk . Previous  analysis of an AS patient with Alu insertion, and a mouse model with  an engineered exon IIIc deletion, indicate that both types of mutation  are likely to cause AS by driving ectopic expression of an FGFR2 iso   form containing the alternatively spliced IIIb exon in mesenchymal tis   sues .

While most (80%) AS cases are X linked, approximately 15% and 5% areautosomal recessive or dif ï¬cult to differentiate from thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) dominant forms. Digenic inheritance among COL4A3 COL4A5 or their concomitance with other glomerulopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD) related genes, has been recently proposed to explain the variable phenotypic expression andincomplete penetrance frequently observed in AS patients.1244Materials and Methods: NGS analysis of 55 glomer  ulopathy and CKD related genes was performed in a group of 56 unrelated Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In all patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. Overall, 17 known and 32 novel, likely pathogenic alterations in COL4A3  COL4A5 were identi ï¬ed. The inheritance was X linked in 73% of cases, remaining 9% autosomal recessive and 18% were dominant AS/TBMN. Changes were randomly distributed across allCOL4A3  COL4A5 coding regions, however we revealed a recurrent COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A in twelve patients. Additionally, four patients with this alteration had likelypathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 , which may modify disease âs severity. Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the gen  otypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on the genotype phenotype correlations. Multiple gene sequencing is an effective approach to obtain geneticinformation in AS, particularly about the mode of inheri  tance which is important for counselling and may help to predict the clinical course, especially for those patients withmild, non speci ï¬c or atypical phenotype.

3162,457,B Evidence for altered calcium signaling and altered mitochondrial function in an autism case study,P09.025,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodeve  lopmental disorders characterized by de ï¬cits in social interaction, communication, and stereotypic behaviors. While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER. This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore. To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com  pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases. The subject âs transcriptome showed increased expression (>5sd) of genes including the ATP2A3 calcium pump and purinergic receptors, and extremely lowexpression (>24sd) of VDAC2, a mitochondrial calcium uptake channel. These ï¬ndings corroborate suggestions of mitochondrial dysfunction in her clinical biochemicalassays and are extended with Seahorse XFp assays. R.L. Nguyen: None. P. Flodman: None. M. Smith: None.

Introduction: Type IV collagen related nephropathy covers a spectrum of hereditary hematuric diseases (thin basementmembrane nephropathy, TBMN; Alport syndrome, AS). Whereas AS results from disease causing variants in COL4A3 5 (autosomal recessive and X linked AS), monoallelic disease causing variants inCOL4A3/4 are associated with TBMN. Methods: Variants of 96 index cases reported between 2009 and 2014 with the clinical tentative diagnosis AS (77/96), TBMN (13/96) or unclear determination of AS/TBMN (6/96) weremeticulously reinterpreted based on ACMG criteria and current amendments. Monoallelic (likely) pathogenic variants in COL4A3 /4 in an AS case were not considered as diagnostic, as thedesignation âautosomal dominant AS âis contested. 6 cases had to be excluded from further analysis due to limited data. Results: In total, 84 variants (allocated to 96 cases) and their genotypes have been reassessed ( COL4A3 : 21/84, COL4A4 : 18/84, COL4A5 : 45/84). 64/90 cases included in the further analysis could be classi ï¬ed as solved (original report: 83/90; p< 0.001, Fisher exact test). 26/90 were classi ï¬ed as ânot solved â(original report: 7/ 90), due to inconclusive results on variant (11/90), on genotype(12/90) or both variant and genotype level (3/90). Conclusions: Transparent and coherent variant /genotype interpretation enables physicians to diagnose hereditary diseasesand allows them to provide patients with well founded informa tion concerning prognosis and recurrence risk. This is especially true for type IV collagen related nephropathy, covering an intri cate phenotypic and genotypic spectrum. Since reassessment ofvariants/genotypes in this study showed a signi ï¬cant reduction in genetic diagnoses, reports on type IV collagen related nephro pathy obtained in the pre ACMG era should be critically evaluated.",2021,,K.M.

The aim of this study was to determine the genetic components  contributing to different systemic sclerosis (SSc) clinical sub phenotypes of limited (lcSSc) and diffuse (dcSSc) cutaneous involvement, and with the SSc specific auto antibodies, anti centromere (ACA) and anti topoisomerase I (ATA) through a genome wide association study  (GWAS). Four GWAS cohorts, comprising 2,296 SSc patients and 5,171 healthy controls, were meta analyzed looking for associations in the selected subgroups. Eighteen polymorphisms were further tested in nine independent cohorts comprising an additional 3,175 SSc patients and 4,971 controls. Conditional analysis for associated SNPs in the HLA region was performed to explore their independent association in antibody subgroups. Overall analysis showed non HLA polymorphisms rs11642873 in IRF8 gene (P , 2.32x10 12, OR , 0.75) and rs12540874 in GRB10 gene (P , 1.27x10 6, OR , 1.15) to be  associated with lcSSc and rs11047102 in SOX5 gene (P , 1.39x10 7, OR , 1.36) with ACA positive patients. In the HLA region, we observed highly associated allelic combinations in the HLA DQB1 locus with ACA (P , 1.79x10 61, OR , 2.48), in the HLA DPA1/B1 loci with ATA (P , 4.57x10 76, OR , 8.84) and in NOTCH4 with ACA P , 8.84x10 21, OR , 0.55) and ATA (P , 1.14x10 8, OR , 0.54).

The platform of choice to  detect genome wide CNVs has traditionally been microarray (including SNP  arrays that can also detect copy neutral LOH regions); however, since samp  les have often undergone sequencing to discover pathogenic sequence vari  ants, it is desirable to exploit these data to also detect CNVs. Various methods  have been proposed to detect CNVs from NGS data, but little information is  available which compare the success of these approaches to orthogonal me  thods. Using a large data set of constitutional samples from an autism cohort  that have been subjected to both whole exome sequencing (WES) and to a  genome wide SNP microarray, we compare the ability to detect CNVs bet   ween these platforms. Several algorithms for CNV detection from the WES data are examined, and the results are compared with an established HMM  based method for detection of CNVs from the microarray platform.",2014,,"L.

2035,210, Optimal ancestry matched imputation of GWAS association summary statistics using large reference panel of sequenced individuals,C22.2,,"The ultimate goal of GWASs is to find disease associated markers, preferab   ly causal variants. GWASs use microarrays to interrogate tag SNPs, there fore many untyped variants need to be inferred through imputation, using the available genotyped SNPs. As demonstrated recently [Pasaniuc et al. (2014)], not only genotypes, but association summary statistics, generated by large meta analytic studies, can be imputed.We propose several improvements to state of the art summary statistic imputation tools. We compute the optimal shrinking of the SNP SNP cor   relation matrix, which flexibly adapts to the reference panel size, local LD structure, region size, etc. In addition, our method allows for summary sta tistics that are dervied from variable sample sizes. Finally, we search for the optimal linear combination of reference panel sub populations in order to match their joint allele frequency distribution to that of the association stu dies. This is analogous to selecting the subset of the reference panel that best represents the individuals in the GWAS cohorts.Our extensive simulation study, using UK10K whole genome sequencing data sets, showed that our optimized shrinkage constant significantly out performs all previously proposed choices when the reference panel is small (<300). We also demonstrated the importance of ancestry weighted mixture using 1000 Genomes subpopulation panels combined with summary stati   stics simulated from our local CoLaus study (Firman et al., 2008). Finally, using cohort level association summary data from the GIANT (Genetic In vestigation of ANthropometric Traits) Consortium, we found that applying ancestry matched imputation of individual cohort summary statistics before meta analysis substantially outperforms the imputation of meta analysed association summary statistics.Financial support: Swiss National Science Foundation (31003A 143914, 51RTP0_151019).",2015,,"S.

Genetic factors have been known to play an important role in the development of IA. Here, we conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify common genetic variants that are associated with IA by using 1383 aSAH subjects and 5484 controls from the Japanese population. The variants that showed suggestive association in the GWAS were validated in an independent set of  1048 IA cases and 7212 controls. We identified, rs6842241, near EDNRA  at  chromosome 4q31.22 (combined P value , 9.58 Ã 10 9; odds ratio , 1.25),  to be significantly associated with IA. Owing to the functional importance of EDNRA  to IA, we performed functional analysis of the associated variants on  EDNRA and identified rs6841581 as a functional variant that might affect  the expression of EDNRA and subsequently result in the IA susceptibility. To further understand the etiology of the disease, we performed pathway analysis utilizing the GWAS dataset and identified Notch signaling pathway to be significantly associated with IA (P GSEA,3.0 Ã 10 6).

Cases of neuropathic pain were de   fined as diabetic patients with a multiple prescription history of at least one of five drugs specifically indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Controls were diabetic individuals who were not prescribed any of these drugs, nor amitriptyline, carbamazepine, or nortriptyline. Those who had one use of the five specific neuropathic pain drugs were further excluded from controls. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test genetic associations, adjusting with covariates.Overall, 961 diabetic neuropathic pain cases and 3,260 diabetic controls were identified. We found a cluster in the Chr1p35.1 (ZSCAN20 TLR12P) with a lowest P value of 2.74 x 10 7 at rs71647933 in females and a cluster in the Chr8p23.1, next to HMGB1P46 with a lowest P value of 8.02x 10 7 at rs6986153 in males.

In fact, cancer is the most commoncause of death in diabetes. We aimed to gain insights into thepathophysiological processes shared between T2D and four cancers through multi phenotype (MP) genome wide association study (GWAS). Methods: We combined GWAS on 36,173 individuals from the pan European EPIC study, including 10,855 T2D cases, 4,126 postmenopausal breast, 2,111 colorectal, 473 pancreatic and 419 prostate cancer cases. The combined GWAS dataset was qualitycontrolled and imputed against the HRC reference panel providing 39.3M DNA variants for analysis. We performed reverse regression MP GWAS as implemented in SCOPA software. Weevaluated the driving disease combinations at identi ï¬ed loci using Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results: Within MP GWAS, we identi ï¬ed 450 independent loci (P < 5x10 8) for the full ï¬ve phenotypes model. Among them, 147 belonged to established T2D/cancer loci. These includedrs35011184 ( TCF7L2 ) and rs2981578 ( FGFR2 ), previously reported for many of ï¬ve studied outcomes. In our MP GWAS, these yielded the best model ï¬t for T2D and breast cancer only, respectively. The 239 novel signals included rs10497931 at MAP2 gene (P , 6.11x10 53) for the ï¬ve phenotype pleiotropic model. Among novel loci, 129 highlighted single phenotype effect as the bestmodel. The remaining 110 signals showed the best ï¬t for MP model, having 67 of them with T2D and at least one cancer. Conclusions: The large data and power, improved through implementation of multi variate GWAS analysis enabled identi ï¬ca tion of ~1/3 of loci with shared T2D cancer effects that mightcontribute to these diseases âcomorbidity.

636,1656,Using genome wide pathway analysis to unravel the etiology of  a complex disease like type 2 diabetes,P08.78,,"Several genome wide association studies (GWAS) have recently been published on a variety of complex diseases . However, 99 .9% of  GWAS data is currently discarded and not analyzed to its full poten   tial . In this study, we took a different approach and aimed to evaluate  alternative methods of obtaining valuable information on disease etiol   ogy from GWAS data . We assessed whether we could detect over   represented biological pathways in the GWAS datasets, by combining  a network based tool, Ã¢ÂÂPrioritizerÃ¢ÂÂ, with a pathway classification tool, Ã¢ÂÂPANTHERÃ¢ÂÂ . As an example, we used publicly available data from two type 2 diabe   tes (T2D) GWAS; the Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI) and the Well   come Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) . Of the 1,179 SNPs  in the DGI dataset and the 1,712 SNPs in the WTCCC dataset that showed association with T2D with a p value lower than 0 .003, we were  able to map 559 and 797 SNPs, respectively, to genomic loci that con   tained one or more genes . Prioritizer then selected the most promising  gene(s) from each locus based on their functional interactions with genes on the other loci . We used PANTHER to assign each of the  selected genes to a specific pathway and to test whether we saw more genes in each pathway than expected . Our results showed that the Ã¢ÂÂinflammation mediated by chemokine and  cytokine signalingÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂWnt signalingÃ¢ÂÂ pathways were consistently the most strongly overrepresented in the T2D data .

Results: Of 4,363 SNPs investigated, eight SNPs showed suggestive asso   ciation (P<0.01) in our previously published GWAS datasets (Stage 1). Of the eight SNPs, rs2735591 and rs4889841 showed significant association  (P<0.001) in an independent series of 1,504 cases and 1,502 controls (Sta   ge II), but only rs2735591 (next to BCL10) showed significant association  in the second independent series of 938 cases and 5,827 controls (Sta   ge III). Rs2735591 showed consistent association across the three stages  (P>0.05 for heterogeneity test), significant association in the combined va lidation samples (P corrected,5.54Ã10 4 after correction for 4,363 SNPs tested),  and genome wide significance in the whole GWAS and validation samples (P,1.03Ã10  9, OR,1.24). In addition, we demonstrated the lower expression  of BCL10 in leprosy lesions than normal skins and the formation of a highly  significant gene network by BCL10 and the eight previously identified genes  (P,1Ã10 19) that regulates the activity of NFÎºB, a major regulator of down  stream inflammatory responses, which provides further biological evidence for the association.Conclusion: We have discovered a novel susceptibility locus on 1p22, which implicates BCL10 as a new susceptibility gene for leprosy.

Here we present CNV analysis for a cohort of 183 consanguineous families with one or more children affected with ASD. We provide new insights into the genetic architecture of ASDs as our cohort is uniquely enriched for recessive loss of function variants. We follow up fin dings and draw comparisons with additional large ASD and control data   sets: the Simons Simplex and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collections (2,670 affected individuals; 9681 total individuals). Comparing across these cohorts, we demonstrate that ascertainment can lead to selec tion of different underlying genetic mechanisms causing ASDs. These diffe rences are reflected in metrics such as the affected male:female ratio and the relative contribution of de novo CNVs versus inherited homozygous de   letions. Specifically, we find that de novo CNVs play a significant role in non consanguineous families with a single affected child (p,0.04), but a lesser role in multiplex families, and they are no more common in ASD cases than  controls in multiplex consanguineous families. In contrast, we present the  strongest statistical evidence (p,0.013) to date that homozygous deletions, are a major contributor to ASD disease burden in consanguineous families,  contributing to as much as 5 10% of cases.",2014,,"K.

2576,2176, General Regression Model: a powerful Ã¢ÂÂmodel freeÃ¢ÂÂ association test for both qualitative and quantitative traits allowing to determine the underlying genetic model of transmission,J18.29,,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are usually assessed using regres   sion models, assuming additive mode of transmission. This choice leads to a  significant loss of power in case of departure from additivity. We propose a General Regression Model (GRM) allowing detection of association without making hypothesis of the mode of transmission. Additionally, GRM permits the simultaneous estimation of the underlying genetic model. We compared the power of GRM to additive and other classical regression association tests under a large panel of genetic models.Powers were estimated by simulation of a 2000 cases and 2000 controls sample for qualitative traits and a sample of 5000 cases for quantitative traits. Four association tests (GRM, additive, recessive or dominant tests) were applied to all replicates. The genetic underlying mode of transmission was then tested using GRM.For both qualitative and quantitative trait, we showed that GRM powers to detect association was similar or greater to that of the additive test. In the case of recessive inheritance, gain of power up to 66% for qualitative and to 93% for quantitative traits respectively. The correct underlying model was determined in most cases.GRM test appears powerful to detect association, as much as or even more than the classically used additive test, especially in case of recessive inhe   ritance. This test is easily applied to GWAS and may be used to analyze or re analyze new or existing GWAS datasets to identify new susceptibility loci involved in complex diseases.",2015,,"M. DIZIER1, E.

Iden tifying genetic variants that influence susceptibility to disease potentially can inform the development of approaches for primary and secondary pre vention. Two groups have published field synopses on genetic variants as sociated with CRC, in JNCI in 2012 and Gut in 2013. These groups are now working together on an update.Methods: We have searched all published (and some unpublished) genetic association data  including candidate gene and GWAS  for CRC to the end of 2015. Furthermore, we have access to 4 GWAS datasets. We are conducting meta analyses. We have reached a consensus on the operationalization of the Venice guidelines on the credibility of genetic association, which had dif   fered between the two previous field synopses.Results: More than 200 genes in about 770 SNPs were identified as putative ly associated with CRC. For 450 SNPs, there was a single study only; for 90 SNPs, two studies; and for 230 SNPs, 3 or more studies.

Introduction: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a high ly prevalent musculoske letal disorder and a leading caus e of disability among older adults. Varicose veins (VVs) are a common venous pathology affecting over one third of adults worldwide. There is increasing evidence of the link between VVs of lower extremities and knee OA, but it is unclear ifthere are causal relationships between the disorders. Materials and Methods: We performed a two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using two pairs of publicly available genome wide association study ( GWAS) summary statistics for Europeans from UK Biobank (Gene ATLAS, N ,452,264) and FinnGen (N,176,899). Each trait pair in cluded non overlapping GWAS datasets on âVVs of lower extremities â(I83 ICD 10 code) and âGonarthrosis â(M17 ICD 10 code) gained from different biobanks. The MR was conducted using inverse variance weighted meta analysis and Causal Analysis Using Summary Effect estimates (CAUSE) approach. All the tests were run in two directions. Results: No statistically signi ï¬cant results were obtained and no concordance between the MR effect estimates (magnitude and direction) was observed. Conclusions: We provided no support for causal relationships between VVs of lower extremities and knee OA.

2615,340, Identification by exome sequencing and functional characterization of nonobvious pathogenic variants responsible for Alport syndrome,P03.06,,"Introduction: Alport syndrome (AS) is a progressive inherited renal disease caused by mutations in three large collagen IV genes (COL4A3, COL4A4, CO L4A5), comprising about 50 exons each. Recently, the introduction of next  generation sequencing allowed the analysis of all three AS genes in a single  step. Despite that, the total mutation detection rate has been estimated bet   ween 55 80%. Materials and Methods: We selected three Italian families with clear clinical evidence of AS but no molecular diagnosis, despite having been subjected to  extensive candidate gene analyses. The probands were screened by whole  exome sequencing (WES) using the Nextera Rapid Capture kit on a Next   Seq500 platform. All exons of AS genes were adequately covered. Results: Analysis of variants within AS genes identified pathogenic muta   tions in all families. In Family 1, we identified an homozygous 24 bp in  frame deletion in COL4A3 (p.Val11_Leu18del), segregating with autosomal  recessive AS. The variant is predicted to disrupt the signal peptide, possibly  altering COL4A3 protein secretion. In Family 2 proband, a COL4A5 hemi   zygous missense mutation (p.Gly491Asp) was found in exon 33, which was not covered by previous targeted resequencing. In Family 3, we detected an heterozygous intronic variant (c.2245 40A>G) altering COL4A5 exon 29 branch site, as we confirmed by in vitro studies. Analysis of the pattern of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) on DNA from blood revealed a correlation between unbalanced XCI and phenotypic manifestations in mutant females.Conclusions: WES was fundamental to provide a molecular diagnosis in 3 AS families, highlighting non obvious pathogenic variants that escaped pre vious screenings.We thank: Italian Telethon Foundation (grant#GGP11177) and Fondazione Cariplo (grant#2013 0825).",2016,,"C.

1424,251,The IL23R Non Synonymous Polymorphism rs11209026 is Associated with Radiographic Sacroiliitis in Spondyloarthritis,P01.066,,"Objective: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a group of inflammatory articular dis   orders sharing genetic background. The non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism rs11209026 (Arg381Gln) in the IL23R gene, has reproducib ly been shown as associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Here, we ex   amined the association between rs11209026 and SpA as a whole. Particular attention was devoted to genotype phenotype correlation.Methods: rs11209026 was genotyped in a French collection of 415 cases/372 controls and 383 trios. Association analysis was carried out in SpA as a whole group and then separately in AS and non radiographic SpA (non AS) patients. Phenotype/genotype correlations were examined using a logistic regression analysis.Results: A significant association between rs11209026 and SpA was only identified in the familial dataset (P , 0.03; OR , 0.57). Strong associati on with AS was observed in both case/control and familial datasets (P , 4.5x10 4 and 4x10 3, respectively). In contrast, such association was not detected with the non AS group. Furthermore, rs11209026 frequency was significantly different between the AS and non AS patients (P , 2.5x10 3). Phenotype/genotype correlation study revealed that both radiographic sacroiliitis and an early onset were independently associated with a lower frequency of the rare protective rs11209026 allele A in patients (P , 9x10 3 and 8x10 3, respectively).Conclusion: Our study replicated the robust association between rs11209026 and AS, in the French population. However such association was restricted to AS patients, as compared to non radiographic SpA. The fact that it was independently conditioned by radiographic sacroiliitis and age at onset sug gests that rs11209026 could affect the disease severity rather than suscep   tibility.  F.

The occurrence of ANK2 mutation transporters in hereditary primary arrhythmia syndrome (IPAS), nevertheless, is uni dentiï¬ed in Albanian. By means of a next generation sequencer, we intended to recognize ANK2 mutations in the cohort of IPAS individuals, in whom conservative Sangersequencing not succeeded to recognize pathogenic muta  tions in main contributing genes, and to appraise the clinical features of ANK2 mutation transporters. Materials and Methods We monitored 524 probands with IPAS and investigated 42 genes counting entire ANK2 exons applying a bench top NGS (MiSeq, Illumina) orcarried out whole exome sequencing applying HiSeq2000 (Illumina). Results 10 of 524 probands (1.8%, aged 0 â55 years, 7 males) were discovered to hold 6 dissimilar heterozygous ANK2 mutations. ANK2 W1535R was recognized in 3LQTS individuals and 1 symptomatic BrS and was calcu  lated as harmful by numerous forecast software. Altogether, as to phenotype, there were 7 LQTS, 1BrS, 2 IVF.

The world  wide average prevalence of ASDs is 1 in 160 children and1 3% of ID. Due to the genetic heterogeneity of these pathologies different genetic tests are available. Today,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1439chromosomal microarray is the ï¬rst tier recommended diagnostic test and provides a yield around 10 15% for ID patients and around 9% for ASDs patients, depending on the cohort. Our goal is to evaluate if the diagnostic yield estimated by targeted sequencing in our cohorts of ID or ASDs subjects is higher than that obtained by CGH array.We screened 701 in house selected ID related genes and 189 autism related genes in a cohort of more than 100 and 60 patients, respectively. Libraries were prepared withdifferent capture kits and the Illumina NextSeq500 platform was used to sequence targeted regions. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with an in house pipeline. Thediagnostic yield was 41% in the ID cohort and 20% in the ASDs cohort. Variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 50% of the ID patients and 72% of the autism patients and negative results were obtained in 9% and 8% of the ID and autism individuals, respectively. ID or autism  related genes sequencing provide higher diagnostic yieldsthan CGH array. Furthermore, copy number variants evaluation could be performed simultaneously with our pipeline. For this reason, we proposed targeted sequencingas the ï¬rst tier genetic test for ID and autism diagnosis. M. PeÃ±a Vilabelda: A.

Saitoh1 1Hokkaido University  Sapporo  Japan  2Center for Neurobiology and Behavior  Department of Psychiatry  University of Pennsylvania  Philadel phia  PA United S,To understand the role of histone acetylation in genomic imprinting  wehave investigated the status of histone acetylation of imprinted loci inhuman 15q11 q13  which is associated with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS)and Angelman syndrome (AS)  and the syntenic region in mouse 7C. Weperformed Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using anti acety lated histone H3 and H4 antibodies to assess histone acetylation. Lym phoblastoid cells from PWS and AS patients  and controls  as well asfibroblasts from PWS and AS model mice carrying a 4 Mb deletion  andcontrol mice were used. We have previously identified parent of origin spe cific histone acetylation confined to the CpG island of SNURF SNRPN. Inthis study  we extended the study to 6 human loci including 5 paternally expressed loci (MKRN3  MAGEL2  NDN  SNURF SNRPN  and IPW)  and1 maternally expressed (UBE3A)  as well as 4 mouse paternally expressed loci (Mkrn3  Magel2  Ndn  and Snurf Snrpn). Although the CpGisland of SNURF SNRPN demonstrated a clear difference of histoneacetylation  other human loci did not demonstrate such parent of originspecific differences even in the CpG island of those genes where parent of origin specific DNA methylation has been demonstrated. In contrast  inmouse fibroblasts  the maternally derived inactive allele is less acetylatedthan the paternally derived active allele at all tested loci  with the moststriking difference detected at the CpG island of Snurf Snrpn.

SVAS is an obstructive vascular disorder that causes hemody namically significant narrowing of large arteries. Although the aorta is themost frequently diseased  any artery can be affected  including the pul monary  carotid and coronary arteries. The onset and severity of the vas cular disease in SVAS is variable. If untreated  this disorder can lead toheart failure  myocardial infarction and death. SVAS occurs with an inci dence of 1 in 20 000 life births. It can be inherited as an isolated autoso mal dominant trait or as one symptom of Williams Beuren syndrome  acomplex developmental disorder characterized by cardiovascular  neu robehavioral  facial  connective tissue  and metabolic abnormalities. Innonsyndromic SVAS patients up to now 14 different mutations have beenreported in the Elastin gene.

219,304,Detailed deletion breakpoint mapping alongside  in depth cognitive profiling as a tool to aid genotype  phenotype correlations in Williams Beuren Syndrome,P213.,,"Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a developmental disorder  caused by a hemizygous deletion (~1.5Mb) at chromosome 7q11.23. The phenotype is complex with striking physical, cognitive and  behavioural aspects that include overall IQs in the range of 50 60  alongside an uneven cognitive profile (verbal tasks outstripping  spatial tasks). Physically, WBS phenotypes include a dysmorphic  face, congenital heart disease (typically SVAS), growth retardation,  hyperacusis, premature ageing, and infantile hypercalcaemia. Up  to 25 genes have been identified within the critical region, however,  only hemizygosity for elastin is associated with a phenotype  (SVAS). Therefore, alone or in combination, some of the remaining  deleted genes appear to be responsible for the other features of  WBS. Generally, relations between genotype and phenotype in  WBS are studied at the group level with rather gross measures of  behavioural outcome, yet, much is to be gained by more in depth  cognitive studies. We have performed detailed cognitive analyses  on a number of WBS individuals to identify those which show higher  or lower functioning. One higher functioning patient (WBS HF)  has been genotyped using somatic cell hybrids and compared at  both molecular and cognitive levels with patients exhibiting classic  phenotypes or SVAS, to correlate genotype with phenotype. The  results show that despite above average scores for the syndrome,  WBS HF had the typical uneven profile of WBS and a characteristic  WBS chromosomal deletion. In contrast, the SVAS patients, with a  smaller deletion, displayed a normal profile suggesting that genes at  the telomeric end of the WBS deletion are important in causing the  WBS cognitive profile.",2003,,"Tassabehji1, M.

BHF probably affects at least 1% of the population and  is characterized by persistent microscopic glomerular hematuria,  sometimes with proteinuria or hypertension, thinning of the  glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and normal renal function.  Considering the similarities in GBM abnormalities, TBMD cannot be  clinically differentiated from the initial stages of AS. It has recently  been suggested that TBMD represents a carrier state of autosomal  recessive or X linked AS.

In the control group, the distribution was 26 (65%) homozygous 128S, 13 (32.5%) heterozygous S128R and 1 (2.5%)  homozygous 128R.The distribution of the E selectin genotype in our control group showed Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, which veriÃ¯Â¬Âed that the control group was statistically appropriate, and that the genotyping protocol was error  free.The genotype distribution in the AS group was statistically signiÃ¯Â¬Âcant different (ÃÂ 2=5.74) from the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Disease association with S128R was assessed by single locus and single locus allele based ÃÂ 2 tests for a 3x2, respectively 2x2 contingency  table, to compare each genotype/allele frequency in patients with AS versus control individuals. No signiÃ¯Â¬Âcant association was found in  either situation.The Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium observed in AS group could be produced by random sampling errors due to small population size (estimated frequency of AS in general Caucasian population is 0.1  0.2%).",2005,,"Popa1, R.

388,815,Analysis of a group of probands with Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes by the ms mLPA method,P0797.,,"Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes (PWS and AS) are two distinct  neurogenetic disorders caused by loss of function of imprinted genes in 15q11 q13 . The loss of expression of these genes results from  various mechanisms: deletion of the critical region, uniparental disomy, imprinting defects or gene mutation . First, we studied 27 patients with PWS and 17 patients with AS,  previously confirmed by microsatellite, FISH and methylation analysis  by a new method, Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent  Probe Amplification (MS MLPA). In the PWS group we confirmed all  19 deletions, 5 uniparental maternal heterodisomies, 2 uniparental maternal isodisomies, and one case with an imprinting defect . In  the group of 17 AS patients we confirmed all 16 deletions and one uniparental paternal isodisomy  . Next we studied using MS MLPA 5 additional new patients, 4 PWS and  1 AS, and we revealed 2 cases with uniparental maternal disomies,  2 cases with uniparental maternal isodisomies, and 1 case with uniparental paternal isodisomy  . We also applied the MS MLPA method to two cases with marker chromosome 15 and an Angelman like phenotype . We detected three alleles, two methylated and one unmethylated, in both cases . The new MS MLPA method is robust and highly useful for the detection Molecular and biochemical basis of disease of copy number changes and methylation status in the critical PWS/AS  region .

Screening for UBE3A mutations: preliminary results,P0262.,,"Molecular defects within chromosomal region 15q11  q13, which con   tains genes regulated by the imprinting centre (IC), are responsible  for Angelman (AS) and Prader Willi (PWS) syndromes. Differentially  methylated regions of the IC play a major role in the establishment  of the methylation pattern and genomic imprinting of the locus. PWS  is considered a Ã¢ÂÂcontiguous gene syndromeÃ¢ÂÂ, while UBE3A imprinted  gene has been implicated as the AS gene, since genomic mutations  of which have been identified as the sole molecular defect in AS pa   tients. Routine molecular analysis with Methylation Specific PCR and Dinou   cleotide Repeat Polymorphism analysis was performed in 185 patients  referred for AS (87) and PWS (98).The diagnosis was confirmed in  11 AS and 16 PWS patients. 30 patients referred for AS were further  analyzed by mutation screening of the UBE3A gene by automated se   quencing of exons 9,12, 15 and 16. Large deletions were excluded by the presence of the expected PCR  product and no mutations were identified. 4  6% of AS patients are predicted to have mutations in UBE3A gene,  most of which are located in exons 9, 12, 15, 16. Since 75  80% of  these mutations are familial characterization of the defect and genetic  counselling are essential.

480,781,Analysis of molecular defects in Polish Angelman  Syndrome patients,P0646.,,"Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a rare neurogenetic disorder that is  caused by impaired UBE3A  gene expression resulting from changes  in the parental genomic imprinting or specific mutations.

The imprinting defects may result from micro   deletion of the imprinting center or somatic mosaicism. The aim of the  study was the identification of molecular defect in the patients with  clinical manifestation of AS. Two hundred twelve patients with clinical symptoms of AS were in   cluded in the study. First, the analysis of imprinting defect was done  with PCR based DNA methylation analysis of PW71  and SNRPN  loci  (MS PCR).

Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a complex neurobehavioral disorder as   sociated with loss of function of differentially expressed imprinted gene  at the region 15q11 q13. It is a rare disorder. It occurs in one of 20  000 live births. It is due either to a microdeletion in the 15q11 locus  (65 75%), or to uniparental disomy (5%), or to UBE3a gene mutations  (10%), or to an anomaly of printing center (5%). In the 10% remainders  cases, the cause still unknown. The molecular study of the patients appear with a great importance  with an aim of being able to conclude about the parental origin and,  therefore, about the disease. In this work, we developed an experimental protocol able to ensure  the molecular detection of this pathology. It is based on the MS MLPA  technique (Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe  Amplification), which is able to detect abnormal methylation of imprint   ed genes as well as deletion occurring at 15q11 q13 locus. The study  of STRs markers of chromosome 15 allowed us to distinguish between  uniparental disomy and microdeletion when abnormal methylation was  detected. These two complementary techniques allowed us to study 8 suspected  AS patients. Only one of them showed a deletion in the 15q11 q13  region. This anomaly was confirmed with FISH (Fluorescent In Situ  Hybridysation). The combination of these two techniques, in the diagnosis of AS,  represents a very good strategy to find more than 85% of causative  anomalies. It can easily be used in the majority of laboratories because  of its low price and simplicity.",2007,,"Gribaa1, S. Kacem1, H. Elghezal1, M. Yaacoub2, N. Gaddour3, A.

Here, we have identified different novel mutations in the  FGFR2 gene in the last two outstanding Apert patients with unidenti   fied mutation from a cohort of 227 patients. One is a 1.9 kb deletion,  removing the entire exon IIIc of the gene and substantial portions of  the flanking introns. This is the first large FGFR2 deletion described in any patient with craniosynostosis . The other mutation is a  de novo   Alu insertion into the IIIc exon of FGFR2. This is the third identified  AS related Alu insertion within 105 bp of sequence, a remarkable en   richment considering that only ~30 new Alu insertions have been de   scribed in all human diseases . Computational analysis revealed that  the inserted Alu element belongs to a new subfamily, not previously  known to be mobile, which we characterize and term Alu Yk . Previous  analysis of an AS patient with Alu insertion, and a mouse model with  an engineered exon IIIc deletion, indicate that both types of mutation  are likely to cause AS by driving ectopic expression of an FGFR2 iso   form containing the alternatively spliced IIIb exon in mesenchymal tis   sues .

We assessed the CNV  status using MLPA (52 regions) in the 20 AS family trios, and expanded the study to idiopathic mental retardation (n,220) and autism (n,100) .  CNV analysis by MLPA was also assessed in 450 control samples . The  findings included: two de novo deletions (1p36, 1q44), one maternally  inherited duplication (Xp11 .23), altered regions in diseases cases but not present in controls (4q31 .3, 6q21, 6q26, 7q22 .1, Xp11 .23, Xp22 .2  and Xq28), and several inherited genomic variants (5q31 .2, 9q33 .1,  10p12 .33, 16p13 .3, 17p13 .1 and 19q13 .41) not found neither in other samples nor in controls . Our results support the view that a consider   able proportion of genomic regions showing variability in copy number could be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders . The absence of  genomic abnormalities in controls of inherited genomic changes de   tected in cases, suggests that even if inherited, they could be respon   sible for some of the clinical features perhaps uncovering recessive  mutations in specific genes involved in the phenotypes.",2008,,"S.

557,438,Laboratory progress in molecular diagnosis of Prader Willi  syndrome and Angelman syndrome   A new strategy by  methylation specific competitive multiplex PCR,P02.056,,"Introduction: Most of the Prader Willi syndrome and Angelman syn   drome patients are caused by the deletion of chromosomal 15q11 13 or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 . There are many diagnostic  tools available like the FISH analysis, methylation based PCR, multi   plex PCR, High Resolution Melting analysis and commercialized MS MLPA . Each of them has some disadvantages and limitations such as  high costs, time consuming and requiring DNA bisulfite treatment. We  introduce a novel, in house designed methylation specific competitive  multiplex PCR, which takes three hours for the reaction, avoids bisul   fite treatment of DNA and provides reliable results of PWS and AS. Material and methods: 68 patients with clinical suspicion of PWS, two  with AS, and 20 unaffected individuals from the general population  were analyzed. In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, we amplified  one SNRPN control gene, the KRITI gene to serve as internal control,  and the promoter of the SNRPN gene, which could be digested them with HhaI enzyme . By comparing the copy number of the three re   gions, we could differentiate the wild type, deletion type and UPD type PWS within one reaction . We also evaluated other different diagnostic technologies in clinical applications . Results: In this article, we successfully made the molecular diagno   sis of one AS patients and 46 PWS patients by several different tech   niques . In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, the total copy numbers were accurately calculated in all of the cases . Conclusions: The MS competitive multiplex PCR strategy is a good al   ternative for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS . This approach could  serve as an alternative genotyping platform for epigenetics .",2008,,"S. Y. Lin , C. H. Lin, Y. N.

The usage of probes  specific for 15q11 q13 locus  makes it useful as a diagnostic tool in the  diagnosis of Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) . The  aim of our study was the implementation of MS MLPA technique as a standard diagnostic procedure in PWS/AS patients . The Salsa MS MLPA Prader Willi / Angelman Kit (ME028) was used according to MRC HOLLAND suggested protocol . The MS MLPA peak  analysis, normalization and calculation of dosage ratio were performed with the SoftGenetics LLC GeneMarker ver 1 .6 software . For the pilot  study, we have chosen 20 cases with established PWS or AS mo   lecular diagnosis based on PCR based DNA methylation analysis of  SNRPN  locus  (MS PCR) and the STR analysis of deletion or UPD  presence . The results of the analysis of the copy number variation and the meth   ylation status in 15q11 q13 locus  with MS MLPA confirmed the previ   ous findings obtained for the pilot patients. We have also performed  the copy number variation analysis in additional 16 AS and 24 PWS patients with abnormal methylation status detected by MS PCR . The  MS MLPA technique allowed to exclude from the further molecular  analysis patients with the deletion without the necessity parents test   ing .

Over the past years, the convergence of genomic technologies has led to the identification of several susceptibility loci by means of linkage studies. Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. We analysed two families showing both autism and epilepsy. The first one is the family of a woman, showing a severe and progressive epileptic disorder, who is married with an healthy man and has six children: two girls are healthy, a girl and two boys are affected by autism, while a boy showed partial seizures only twice. The three children with autism show a moderate mental retardation and an EEG with no epileptic alterations. The second family is composed by an epileptic woman married with a healthy man and their child affected by autism.The genetic basis of autism and epilepsy were studied in these  families. In particular, we performed an array CGH analysis to search for pathological CNVs which are common to all affected members of the two families.The study detected a single common region on chromosome 15q11.2, which has already been reported to be either deleted or duplicated in about 1% of epileptic patients.

During this research comparative genotyping of two Russian cohorts was performed, both of which combine HLA B27 positive individuals.Among a large number of MHC genes it was the HLA B27, which was  strongly associated with autoimmune arthropathies. Also few other candidate genes were involved in the development of pathogenesis. Most of those genes take part in various immunological processes such as differentiation and antigen presentation. In this research we study variability of candidate gene   ERAP1 specially in Russian Caucasian population.We analyzed an association of several most associated with AS coding region SNPs in the ERAP1 gene. Was genotyped 5 ERAP1 SNPs (rs2287987, rs30187, rs10050860, rs17482078, rs27044) in  70 AS patients and 83 HLA B27 positive healthy controls from the Russian Caucasian population by SSP PCR.Considerable differences in alleleÃ¢ÂÂs frequencies within patients vs control cohort were shown for 3 of 5 SNPs under investigation. Using the EM algorhitm we reconstructed 3 marker haplotypes that distinguish with high probability two cohorts due to differences in the haplotypes frequencies. In such a way both the sensitive, CCT, haplotype and the protective, TTC, one were predicted. To verify the calculation we determined genuine frequencies of 5 marker haplotypes in AS cohort by haplotyping of individual cDNA samples. As a result presumably risk CCT haplotypes of ERAP1 gene was detected in 65 of 69 examined AS patientsÃ¢ÂÂ genomes.We forecasted ERAP1 risk haplotype CCT  (rs17482078/10050860/2287987) and demonstrated that its frequency detected within AS cohort reaches 88%.",2011,,"V.

1132,1579, t hree novel mutations in t urkish patients with Alstrom s yndrome,P12.007,,"AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome (AS) is a rare multisystemic disorder. Major clinical symptoms of the disease are congenital retinal dystrophy leading to blindness, neurosensorial hearing lost, childhood obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutant form of ALMS1 gene causes AS. ALMS1 is a novel gene which is comprised  of 23 exons encoding a protein of 4169 amino acids that does not  share significant sequence homology with any other known genes. The ALMS1 protein is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies of ciliated cells, perhaps playing an important role in cilia function and intraflagellar transport. RNA interference knockdown experiments indicate that a total lack of ALMS1 impairs cilia formation. To date, more than 100 mutations, mostly nonsense and frameshift type, in ALMS1 have been reported in AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome. The reported mutations are primarily clustered in exons 16, 10, and 8, but less  common mutations also occur in exons 12, 18 and 11. In present study, four Turkish AS patients were analysed. Mutation screening of the whole coding region and all intron/exon boundaries were performed by PCR and direct sequencing. As a result of sequence analysis, three novel mutations; c.4155insA; T1386NfsX15, c.5311C>T; p.Q1771X, c.9749C>A; p.S3250X and several polymorphism; IVS4+20T>A, F731F, V673G, D2674H, R4031K, IVS18 12T>C were detected in patients.

Application of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to clinical practice,  unraveled genetic aberration in MR patients with normal constitutional ka  ryotype. Here we report a five year old girl with mental and motor retarda  tion, epilepsy, and dysmorphic findings with normal constitutional karyo  type. To determine the genetic contribution in the development of clinical findings, aCGH analysis was performed. Roche NimbleGen Human CGH ISCA  Plus 3x1.4M Array was used for aCGH analysis. The data were analyzed by  using Nexus6 software (BioDiscovery). As a result of aCGH analysis, 5 chro mosomal regions were marked as important regions. Among these regions, one of them has been found to be related with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, previously. Microdeletion in the PTCHD1 locus on  Xp22.11 has been has been found in autism spectrum patients but not in he alty controls. However, we found a 24.3kb copy gain in the same locus in our patient. This finding showed that PTCHD1 locus may not be disrupted with  deletion only, copy gain in that region might also have effect on the gene, and its function. Also, other identified copy gains and loss may have contributed to the accompanying dysmorphic findings. As we experienced in the current patient, array CGH analysis is a valuable tool in uncovering submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements.  Y.K. Terzi: None. F.I. Sahin:  None. Z. Yilmaz Celik: None.

As autism is one of the most debilitating neurocognitive disorders and only cli nical criteria are available, some more effective and not so subjective signs are needed.

Concordance between pooled and single subject results were demonstrated for 2 of the selected miRNAs by qRT PCR analyses, identifying significant difference only for down regulated mir 361 5p (p<0,0001; mean RQ:   0,38) and up regulated mir 486 3p (p<0,0001; mean RQ: 8,003), but not for miR 766 3p (p,0,995) in autistic group. The expression changes of the miRNA signature were then evaluated for their correlation with the patientsâ clinical symptoms measured by Gilliam Au tism Rating Scale (GARS) which reveals correlation of the communication and stereotype subscales with mir 361 5p (p,0,028/ p,0,043).

Recent studies have reported the associations of IL23R gene single nucleoti   de polymorphisms (SNPs) with the risk of AS in Caucasian populations.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of IL23R gene SNPs with the risk of AS in Romanian population. Methods: Nine SNPs mapping to IL23R gene (rs11805303, rs7530511,  rs10489629, rs2201841, rs11465804, rs11209026,Arg381Gln, rs1343151,  rs11209032, rs1495965) were genotyped in 168 consecutive AS patients  and 161 healthy controls of Romanian ethnicity using the Sequenom Mas sARRAY platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) and/or TaqMan assays (Ap  plied Biosystems, USA). Statistical analyses were performed with PLINK and  Haploview softwares. Results: We found no association between AS and individual SNPs in IL23R  gene. The combined analysis of the studied SNPs revealed the association between AS and the 3 marker haplotype GCG rs11209026/rs1343151/ rs11209032 (30% in patients versus 38% in controls, p,0.02, OR 0.69).  The extended haplotype TTGCG rs2201841/rs11465804/rs11209026/ rs1343151/rs11209032 was also significantly underrepresented in pati   ents (24.5% versus 33.4% in controls, p,0.01, OR 0.65), thus conferring a  lower risk for the disease.

Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists.

Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood and epilepsy occurs in 10 30% of autism patients. Recently, a role of potassium inward rectifying channels in the pathogenesis of autism disease has been postu lated due to the identification in patients affected by autism and epilepsy of two mutations in the KCNJ10 gene. The gene encodes the Kir4.1 channel which is expressed in astrocytes and neurons.We then searched for mutati   on in the KNCJ10 gene, as well as in two genes (KCNJ2 and KCNJ16) coding for additional Kir channels with reported expression in astrocytes and neu rons, in two unrelated patients. We detected a new mutation in the KCNJ2 gene in a boy affected by autism.

The world  wide average prevalence of ASDs is 1 in 160 children and1 3% of ID. Due to the genetic heterogeneity of these pathologies different genetic tests are available. Today,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1439chromosomal microarray is the ï¬rst tier recommended diagnostic test and provides a yield around 10 15% for ID patients and around 9% for ASDs patients, depending on the cohort. Our goal is to evaluate if the diagnostic yield estimated by targeted sequencing in our cohorts of ID or ASDs subjects is higher than that obtained by CGH array.We screened 701 in house selected ID related genes and 189 autism related genes in a cohort of more than 100 and 60 patients, respectively. Libraries were prepared withdifferent capture kits and the Illumina NextSeq500 platform was used to sequence targeted regions. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with an in house pipeline. Thediagnostic yield was 41% in the ID cohort and 20% in the ASDs cohort. Variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 50% of the ID patients and 72% of the autism patients and negative results were obtained in 9% and 8% of the ID and autism individuals, respectively. ID or autism  related genes sequencing provide higher diagnostic yieldsthan CGH array. Furthermore, copy number variants evaluation could be performed simultaneously with our pipeline. For this reason, we proposed targeted sequencingas the ï¬rst tier genetic test for ID and autism diagnosis. M. PeÃ±a Vilabelda: A.

Extensively reported mutations in the COL4A3/A4/A5 genes are causative of both the autosomal and the X linked forms. Although great pharmacologicaladvances have been achieved in the past years, unfortunately no de ï¬nitive therapy is currently available. Podocytes, terminally differentiated cells, produce a unique collagen inthe GBM. We have previously demonstrated that podocyte  lineage cells can be isolated from AS patients âurine, and we have proven the ef ï¬ciency of a bi plasmid (AAV)2  CRISPR/Cas9 approach to restore the wild type genotype in vitro . Two mutations, namely the COL4A5 p.G624D and theCOL4A3 p.G526E, mimicking XLAS and ADAS forms respectively, were effectively corrected with an HDRpercentage greater than 44% and undesired in/dels lower than 12%. Here we show that, moving to a preclinical approach, it is possible to correct the causative COL4A5   Ex9 10bp deletion in a naturally occurring dog model, using a macro 500bp DNA Donor. The target region, in 80% of all treated cells, was corrected without in/dels in the neigh boring sites. A silent mutation, inserted as a tag on the PAM, was used to monitor the correction and to protect the DNA from a new spCas9 cut. Based on AAV2/GFP biodistribu tion, in vivo infection with (AAV)2 CRISPR/Cas9 will be performed at 2 3 months of age using single carotid artery catheterization to target both renal arteries.

Introduction: Alport syndrome (AS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous nephropathy caused by pathogenic variants inCOL4A3, COL4A4 orCOL4A5 . About 85% of AS patients have X linked inheritance, which causes more severe phenotype in males, whereas in females, penetrance depends onX chromosome inactivation pattern. Originating in the MiddleAges COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A p.Gly624Asp is predominant in Central/East Europe and mostly gives mild AS symptoms. Materials and Methods: Next generation sequencing analysis of glomerulopathy and chronic kidney disease related genes panelwas performed in Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In 65 patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. The most frequent was X linked AS caused by 32different COL4A5 variants (75%). A recurrent COL4A5 variant p. Gly624Asp in 15 patients (nine males and six females) was identi ï¬ed. Additionally, four patients with this substitution had pathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 . The clinical course of patients with this genotype was mostly milder than observed in individuals with other COL4A5 variants. They presented only haematuria with or without proteinuria. Of these, two patients alsohad hearing impairment: male with only p.Gly624Asp variant andfemale with additional variant in COL4A3 . Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the genotypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on thegenotype phenotype correlations. Variant p.Gly624Asp in COL4A5 was predominant and accounted for 31% of X linked AS in the study group. Observations of mild phenotype in our patients withthis genotype relate to literature data.

While most (80%) AS cases are X linked, approximately 15% and 5% areautosomal recessive or dif ï¬cult to differentiate from thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) dominant forms. Digenic inheritance among COL4A3 COL4A5 or their concomitance with other glomerulopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD) related genes, has been recently proposed to explain the variable phenotypic expression andincomplete penetrance frequently observed in AS patients.1244Materials and Methods: NGS analysis of 55 glomer  ulopathy and CKD related genes was performed in a group of 56 unrelated Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In all patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. Overall, 17 known and 32 novel, likely pathogenic alterations in COL4A3  COL4A5 were identi ï¬ed. The inheritance was X linked in 73% of cases, remaining 9% autosomal recessive and 18% were dominant AS/TBMN. Changes were randomly distributed across allCOL4A3  COL4A5 coding regions, however we revealed a recurrent COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A in twelve patients. Additionally, four patients with this alteration had likelypathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 , which may modify disease âs severity. Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the gen  otypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on the genotype phenotype correlations. Multiple gene sequencing is an effective approach to obtain geneticinformation in AS, particularly about the mode of inheri  tance which is important for counselling and may help to predict the clinical course, especially for those patients withmild, non speci ï¬c or atypical phenotype.

Ovchinnikov Institute of bioorganic chemistry of the  Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation. The purpose of our research was to find genetic factors of autoimmune  arthropathies. During this research comparative genotyping of two Russian cohorts was performed, both of which combine HLA B27 positive individuals.Among a large number of MHC genes it was the HLA B27, which was  strongly associated with autoimmune arthropathies. Also few other candidate genes were involved in the development of pathogenesis. Most of those genes take part in various immunological processes such as differentiation and antigen presentation. In this research we study variability of candidate gene   ERAP1 specially in Russian Caucasian population.We analyzed an association of several most associated with AS coding region SNPs in the ERAP1 gene. Was genotyped 5 ERAP1 SNPs (rs2287987, rs30187, rs10050860, rs17482078, rs27044) in  70 AS patients and 83 HLA B27 positive healthy controls from the Russian Caucasian population by SSP PCR.Considerable differences in alleleÃ¢ÂÂs frequencies within patients vs control cohort were shown for 3 of 5 SNPs under investigation. Using the EM algorhitm we reconstructed 3 marker haplotypes that distinguish with high probability two cohorts due to differences in the haplotypes frequencies. In such a way both the sensitive, CCT, haplotype and the protective, TTC, one were predicted. To verify the calculation we determined genuine frequencies of 5 marker haplotypes in AS cohort by haplotyping of individual cDNA samples. As a result presumably risk CCT haplotypes of ERAP1 gene was detected in 65 of 69 examined AS patientsÃ¢ÂÂ genomes.We forecasted ERAP1 risk haplotype CCT  (rs17482078/10050860/2287987) and demonstrated that its frequency detected within AS cohort reaches 88%.",2011,,"V.

3166,461,A Heterozygous de novo truncating mutation of nucleolin in an ASD individual disrupts its nucleolar localization,P09.030,,"J. B. Vincent1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada,2Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,3Queen âs University,, Kingston, ON, Canada, 4University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Worcester, MA, United States Introduction: Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein, playing a critical role in multiple processes, including ribosome assembly and maturation, chromatin decondensa tion, and pre rRNA transcription. Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p.Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen  cing of an autism spectrum disorder trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C  terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis  localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p.Gly664*, shows a very similar effect on the location of the NCL protein, thus con ï¬rming the presence of the nucleolar location signal of NCL protein in this region. FRAP showssigniï¬cant changes in the kinetics and mobility of mutant NCL protein in the nucleoplasm. Conclusions: Several other studies have also reported de novo mutations in NCL in ASD or neurodevelopmental dis  orders. Altered mislocalization and dynamics of mutant NCL (p.G664Glufs*70/ p.G664*) may have relevance to the etio pathlogy of NCL related neurodevelopmental phenotypes. T.I. Sheikh: None. N. Vasli: None.

1654,1936,Abnormal growth and dysmorphic features in children with autism spectrum disorders,J06.06,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are very heterogeneous neurodevelop mental disorders of children diagnosed solely on the basis of the triad of per   sistent social and language deficits and stereotypic behaviors. Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism. Identifiable endophenotypes and reliable biomarkers within ASDs would help to focus molecular research and uncover genetic causes and deve lopmental mechanisms.  D. Avdjieva Tzavella: None. S.

In general  largerdiameter collagen fibrils correlate directly with structural properties (stiff ness and maximum force) and material properties (modulus and maximumstress) of tissues  yet dermal tissues of classical EDS patients are friableand dermal scars have apparent reduced mechanical strength. To investi gate this apparent paradox  we examined matrix deposition and collagenfibril morphology in long term cultures of fibroblast cell strains that have afourfold difference in the ratio of type V to type I collagen gene expression.Compared to control cells  fibroblasts from 2 patients with OI type I due toCOL1A1 haploinsufficiency deposited 46% of hydroxyproline per mg pro tein and EDS cells from 2 patients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiencydeposited 38%. However  the EDS cells synthesized approximately thesame amount of total collagen as controls and had similar secreted ratiosof type I/type III collagen as control cells. Average collagen fibril diameterfrom EDS cells was 39.6Ã¢\x80\x93 12.5 nanometers compared to 32.6Ã¢\x80\x936.9 nm forcontrol and 25.1Ã¢\x80\x93 5.2 nm for OI cells. These data indicate that type V col lagen may serve a dual function in dermal tissues. In addition to its posit ed role as a negative regulator of collagen fibril diameter  type V collagenmay serve as a rate limiting nucleator of collagen fibrillogenesis in dermis.A reduced rate of collagen fibril formation in the dermis of classical EDSpatients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiency may override any mechanicaladvantage conferred by increased fibril diameter.412 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian DisordersP1588.

1621,1526,Rare Variant Extensions of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test Detects Associations with Autism Exome Sequence Data,P16.106,,"Many population based rare variant association tests have been developed to analyze sequence data. A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise   quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa   tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7  gene. Given  the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

Vincent1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada,2Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,3Queen âs University,, Kingston, ON, Canada, 4University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Worcester, MA, United States Introduction: Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein, playing a critical role in multiple processes, including ribosome assembly and maturation, chromatin decondensa tion, and pre rRNA transcription. Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p.Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen  cing of an autism spectrum disorder trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C  terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis  localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p.Gly664*, shows a very similar effect on the location of the NCL protein, thus con ï¬rming the presence of the nucleolar location signal of NCL protein in this region. FRAP showssigniï¬cant changes in the kinetics and mobility of mutant NCL protein in the nucleoplasm. Conclusions: Several other studies have also reported de novo mutations in NCL in ASD or neurodevelopmental dis  orders. Altered mislocalization and dynamics of mutant NCL (p.G664Glufs*70/ p.G664*) may have relevance to the etio pathlogy of NCL related neurodevelopmental phenotypes. T.I. Sheikh: None. N. Vasli: None.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorders or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorders (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorders without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

These patients share common clinical features including early onset obesity, intellectual disabili ty and behavioral troubles or autism. A minimal critical region of 1.97 Mb has been estimated, encompassing seven genes (SH3HYL1 , ACP1, TMEM18 ,  SNTG2, TPO, PXDN, and MYT1L). Many recent studies pointed out MYT1L  gene as the main candidate for ID and obesity. We present three new pa tients carrying 2p25 deletions: an autist female child with developmental delay and her depressive father, and a third unrelated patient who has psy   chomotor retardation and behavioral troubles. Moreover, our patients do not have an overweight phenotype, highlighting indeed the role of MYT1L  in obesity, as none of the deletions encompasses MYT1L. The only common  disrupted gene is SNTG2, thus redefining the smallest region of overlap for  autism. SNTG2 is expressed in brain. Its product interacts with neuroligins  NLGN3, NLGN4X, and NLGN4Y, which are autism related isoforms. Finally, the parental origin of the deletions seems to be of interest, as all inherited deletions described today appear to be inherited from the paternal side.

908,1432,Molecular genetic testing of mental retardation in  Bulgaria,P12.128,,"Mental retardation is highly heterogeneous in clinical and genetic point  of view. Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.  Most probably this is due to the characteristics of this group, being  clinically mixed and containing some definite autistic cases.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.  Conclusion: The Arg468His mutation is the most prevalent (6/14 fami   lies) mutation in MFN2 causing CMT2A in Spanish patients and our  study confirmed that it is actually pathological, presenting as a neu   ropathy in a mild to moderate degree.",2010,,"T.

1782,778, S Three SNP haplotypes in Neuroligins may correlate to autism susceptibility,P09.021,,"Chemistry  and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

224,328,Rett patients with both MECP2 mutation and 15q11  13 rearrangments.,P237.,,"Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism (A) are classified as separate  disorders. Recently, the identification of the Preserved Speech  Variant (PSV), where autistic behavior is usual, stressed the  phenotypic overlap between these two conditions. In 1999 it was  shown that about 80% of RTT cases have a de novo  mutation in  the transcriptional silencer MECP2  gene, classifying RTT as a  monogenic X L dominant disorder. Subsequently, we and others  provided evidence that this model was too simple and not sufficient  to explain why germline MECP2  mutations may result in X L mental  retardation in males while they may be silent in carrier females. On  the other hand, we and others have provided evidence that 15q11  q13 maternally inherited duplications are found in autistic children,  suggesting that an abnormal dosage of gene(s) within this region  might be responsible for A. Now we show that a proportion of RTT  patients are carriers of both a MECP2  mutation and a 15q11 q13  duplication and that other RTT patients are carriers of a MECP2   mutation and a 15q11 q13 duplication. Therefore, we hypothesize  a complex model in which a MECP2  mutation is necessary but not  sufficient to cause the RTT phenotype in females, based on the  status of a second gene which, at least in a proportion of cases, may  be abnormal dosage of one or more 15q11 q13 gene.

605,1155,the BDNF receptor gene NTRK  is a susceptibility gene for  autism,P06.034,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely determined by multiple genes . The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant  transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns  5 6  and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) . Given this evidence for association, we  genotyped these markers in a second population sample of 168 Irish trios .

774,11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,,"People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2   gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth  movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects  of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly  conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and  function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak   ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have  been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010,,S.

1099,1315,PON1 phenotype and gene polymorphisms in children with autism,J09.01,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology.  Many genetic and environmental factors are incriminated in its pathogenesis. Subacute exposure to organophosphates (OPs) during critical periods of prenatal neurodevelopment is one of the factors that may trigger autism. Human serum paraoxonase (PON1)  is a HDL associated hydrolase, which in addition to hydrolyzing the OPs, plays a physiological role in reducing LDL oxidation. The PON1 gene shows two functional polymorphisms: M55L and Q192R. These polymorphisms influence the concentration and activity of PON1 towards different substrates, including OPs.The gene environment interaction is tested in the present study by assessing the distribution and frequency of M55L and Q192R polymorphisms in 58 autistic children and 43 controls.No significant difference (p>0.05) in genotypes distribution was found  between autistic patients and controls (QQ 51.72%, QR 43.1%, RR 5.17% / MM 12.1%, ML 60.3%, LL 27.6% for autistic group and QQ 51.16%, QR 44.18%, RR 4.65% / MM 9.3%, ML 53.5%, LL 37.2% for control group).Although, the paraoxonase activity did not present a significant difference between the patients and controls (p>0.05), there was a significant activity increase in the autistic groups with R allele number and both in autistic and control groups with L allele number (p<0.05). The arylesterase activity was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in autistic patients, with no relation to the number of R alleles, but increased in relation with L allele number (p<0.05).These results provide support for the hypothesis that PON1 arylesterase activity could represent a biochemical/genetic test in  estimating autism risk.",2011,,"E.

We identified 5 different phenotypic groups (8 32 children per group), using the behaviour and the intellectual efficiency evaluation criteria from the following tests PER R, CARST , and ADIR.Among them 45 patients (6  14 per group) were negative for FMR1 ampli   fication and then tested by array CGH (180K) to search for deleterious chro mosomal rearrangements. The Array CGH analysis showed the presence of 49 copy number variants (CNV) not referred as polymorphisms in 28 child ren with an average of 2 CNV per patient. A deleterious CNV was found in 5 children from 4 different groups. A parental study was done in 10 families for 14 aberrations : 12 rearrangements were inherited and 2 were de novo with a 6q26 deletion (gene PACRG) and an isochromosome Yp (deletion of NLGN4Y) both considered of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS). Five CNVs were previously reported in autism: 1q21.1,3p26.3q26.2 (CNTN4), 15q13.3 (CHRNA7), 16p11.2 and Xp22.31. Three aberrations in 3p26 (dup) and Xp22 (del/dup) seemed more specific to autism as not present in our cohort of 400 patients with intellectual disability.In conclusion, the aetiologic diagnosis was found in 11% of autistic child ren.",2012,,"E.

1654,1936,Abnormal growth and dysmorphic features in children with autism spectrum disorders,J06.06,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are very heterogeneous neurodevelop mental disorders of children diagnosed solely on the basis of the triad of per   sistent social and language deficits and stereotypic behaviors. Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism. Identifiable endophenotypes and reliable biomarkers within ASDs would help to focus molecular research and uncover genetic causes and deve lopmental mechanisms.  D. Avdjieva Tzavella: None. S.

Genetic and cytogenetic studies revealed that most of the chromosomes are associated with autism, abnormalities of  chromosomes 15 and X being most frequently documented. AIM OF THE STUDY: Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood samples from children with autism was performed to identify possible structural or nume rical chromosomal abnormalities by GTG banding. RESULTS: The study revealed normal karyotypes in most cases (47 out of  50 individuals). Two of the male patients had modified karyotypes (2% mo saicism): chromosome 9qh+ polymorphism and terminal deletion on chro  mosome 15q, respectively. One of the female patients had an extra chromo  some 8 (2% mosaicism).CONCLUSION: This is the first cytogenetic testing performed specifically on  autistic children in Romania. Our results show that karyotyping analysis is not conclusive in most cases with autism. Nevertheless, the test should be proposed and performed for every autistic patient, in order to eliminate possible numerical or structural  chromosomal abnormalities as the cause for AD.  E.

336,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples.

1249,530, Clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with de novo 0.45 Mb deletion of 2p16.1,P03.102,,"The widespread use of microarray methods has contributed to the identi fication of several new rare microdeletion syndromes including that asso   ciated with deletions of 2p15 p16.1. The 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndro me is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, microcephaly, growth retardation, facial abnormalities, disturbed vision and other symptoms. We report here an 11 year old autistic girl showing clinical features consistent with the syndrome. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of the patient showed a normal female karyotype. Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 BeadChip analysis revealed a 0.45 Mb long deletion of the paternal allele of  2p16.1. FISH analysis confirmed the deletion in the patient but not in any of  her parents.

Based on high phenotype similarity of our patient with 6 reported patients  showing the typical phenotype of the 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome  we propose that the critical region of the syndrome can be narrowed down and that these brain expressed genes can be considered candidates for the clinical symptoms. However, multiple deletions of variable length within  the interval between 2p14 and 2p16.1 have been described in patients with  intellectual disability but not necessarily the other typical symptoms of the syndrome and some of these deletions do not overlap.

1508,732,Identification of MicroRNA 486 3p and miR 361 5p molecular signatures associated with autism in whole blood samples as a promising candidate biomarkers,P06.09,,"For molecular diagnostic purposes, it would be desirable to develop peri   pheral blood based biomarkers which effectively identify disease state. As autism is one of the most debilitating neurocognitive disorders and only cli nical criteria are available, some more effective and not so subjective signs are needed. To verify that pooled miRNA expression, reproduce the average of single subject values, we chose 3 micro RNAs (mir 766 3p, mir 486 3p and mir 361 5p), that were found to be dysregulated in autism patients whole blood in previous our work. Concordance between pooled and single subject results were demonstrated for 2 of the selected miRNAs by qRT PCR analyses, identifying significant difference only for down regulated mir 361 5p (p<0,0001; mean RQ:   0,38) and up regulated mir 486 3p (p<0,0001; mean RQ: 8,003), but not for miR 766 3p (p,0,995) in autistic group. The expression changes of the miRNA signature were then evaluated for their correlation with the patientsâ clinical symptoms measured by Gilliam Au tism Rating Scale (GARS) which reveals correlation of the communication and stereotype subscales with mir 361 5p (p,0,028/ p,0,043). The results indicated that the whole blood based miRNA profiling is a promising way to identify candidate biomarkers for autism, and the identified miRNA signa ture warrants further investigation.

1228,392, Genetic study of PTEN mutations among individuals with ASDs / MR and macrocephaly,P02.213,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of severe neurodevelopmen tal conditions among which pervasive developmental disorder (not other   wise specified) and autistic disorder are the most common. The prevalence of ASDs is currently estimated at 60 and 13 per 10,000 for ASDs and autism, respectively. Autistic disorder is often associated with macrocephaly; 24%  of patients have head circumference (HC) at >98th centile. Mutations in the  PTEN gene have been reported in patients with ASDs and significant ma  crocephaly (HC ranging from +2.5 SD to +8 SD). Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis. Three novel (p.Asp331Thrfs*11,  p.Thr321Glnfs*23, p.Glu242*) and two known germline mutations  (p.Pro246Leu, p.Arg130*) have been found in 8 of the 53 probands (15%). We discuss possible genotype/phenotype correlation in our group of pati   ents. Our data support former findings that PTEN mutations are frequent  in patients with ASDs and macrocephaly. Therefore PTEN testing should  be considered in such patients. The findings may impact the assessment of  the recurrence risk and medical management of the families including early cancer prevention.

Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism.

While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver  Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis   order 1 were identified.

The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line. In order to determine the exact localizationand orientation of the duplication FISH experiments using several YACswere performed. ,2001,ermanyk.beyer@dkfz.de,,,One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients.,,autistic patient

The aim  of this study is to determine a possible association between the  polymorphism in serotonin transporter gene and autism. Materials and Methods : Blood samples were obtained from forty eight  individuals with autism (DSM IV) with no associated disorders, thirty  two mothers, twenty seven fathers (twenty three nuclear families)  and 49 normal controls. Each family was seen for a developmental assessment, and also by a  clinical geneticist for identification of eventually associated aetiology. Ages ranged between 3.6 and 41 years. Genotyping were performed by PCR methods. Chi square analysis  was applied to the results. Results: Within the three main possible alleles (9, 10, 12), we  only observed 10 and 12. There were no differences between the  frequencies distribution of autistic individuals and control group. In autistic individuals there was no prevalence of any specific  genotype. There was no difference in allele frequency between the  autistic group versus mothers, fathers, or mothers and fathers. We observed a preferential 12/12 genotype in patients with mothers  carrying the same genotype. This characteristic was not observed  regardind fathers genotype. Conclusions: In this study we did no found any association of autism  with the polymorphism in serotonin transporter gene .

141,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test  and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and  analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose.

336,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples.

After stringent quality control measures, we compared 3K cases to over 19K ethnically matched controls in a two stage genome wide association design. In all, we uncovered 275 statistically significant distinct copy number variable regions. The 60 genes nearest these robust CNVRs are most enriched in gene networks impacting neurological disease, behavior and developmental disorder. A more focused analysis of a subset of 87 CNVRs that are predicted to disrupt 26 genes highlights GABA receptor signaling, and methionine/glutathione trans sulfuration as the most significant canonical pathways disrupted in ASD. Furthermore, we used available family members to characterize CNVRs into inherited vs de novo and used ethnicity information to characterize their effects in different ethnic populations.

However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain   the prime target of the disease   have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex  matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorders, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. Autistic spectrum disorders currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy. Our findings support the hypothesis that somatic genome instability could affect as homeostasis of aneuploid neurons as functioning of the neu ronal network in the whole autistic brain, playing, therefore, an important role in the pathogenesis.

Genetic and cytogenetic studies revealed that most of the chromosomes are associated with autism, abnormalities of  chromosomes 15 and X being most frequently documented. AIM OF THE STUDY: Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood samples from children with autism was performed to identify possible structural or nume rical chromosomal abnormalities by GTG banding. RESULTS: The study revealed normal karyotypes in most cases (47 out of  50 individuals). Two of the male patients had modified karyotypes (2% mo saicism): chromosome 9qh+ polymorphism and terminal deletion on chro  mosome 15q, respectively. One of the female patients had an extra chromo  some 8 (2% mosaicism).CONCLUSION: This is the first cytogenetic testing performed specifically on  autistic children in Romania. Our results show that karyotyping analysis is not conclusive in most cases with autism.

The gene is maternally imprinted in central nervous system and different studies show that loss of expressed copy causes Angelman Sydrome (AS) while the duplication of 15q11q13 represents the genetic cause in 1 3% of autistic patients (dup15 Autism). Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists.

336,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples. Two patients have a paternally  inherited microduplication between the genes GABRA5 and GABRG3 whereas other two patients have a maternally inherited duplication within the D15S1021 marker. All the other duplications are the novo microrearrangements.

1472,616, The genetic basis of autism spectrum disorders: identification and analysis of structural variants,P05.032,,"U.Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 2Department of  Adolescent and Child Psychiatry, K.U.Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 3Department of Parenting  and Special Education, K.U.Leuven, K.U.Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. Background: The genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates.Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort. The sample contains 161 families ascertained through one or more autistic probands with normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability. The study cohort contains 648 individuals: 227 probands, 324 parents, 97 unaffected siblings belonging to 161 families. All probands, unaffected siblings and parents are genotyped with high resolution Illumina OMNI 2.5 8v1 microarrays. For all individuals, an extensive list of phenotypic information is collected inclu   ding IQ, SRS scores, 3DI, clinical genetic examination and family history.Results:We present the results of a family based study on the validity of CNV de   tection in ASD using a high resolution platform. We study the segregation of known and novel rare CNVs with qualitative and quantitative autism phenotypes. Additionally association studies are performed with respect to amongst others gene content and parental origin.Conclusion:With this study we aim to contribute to the clinical validation of the current knowledge of ASD risk variants and to the identification of novel variants.

Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study.

908,1432,Molecular genetic testing of mental retardation in  Bulgaria,P12.128,,"Mental retardation is highly heterogeneous in clinical and genetic point  of view. Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.  Most probably this is due to the characteristics of this group, being  clinically mixed and containing some definite autistic cases.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.

Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism.

1782,778, S Three SNP haplotypes in Neuroligins may correlate to autism susceptibility,P09.021,,"Chemistry  and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

Based on high phenotype similarity of our patient with 6 reported patients  showing the typical phenotype of the 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome  we propose that the critical region of the syndrome can be narrowed down and that these brain expressed genes can be considered candidates for the clinical symptoms. However, multiple deletions of variable length within  the interval between 2p14 and 2p16.1 have been described in patients with  intellectual disability but not necessarily the other typical symptoms of the syndrome and some of these deletions do not overlap. This observati  on indicates that also other genes located in this broader unstable region  are associated with cognitive functioning.

961,317, A c GH Array study in non syndromic (primary) autism disorder,P02.059,,"iNtRODU cti ON: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis  in its etiology. Cytogenetic abnormalities have been detected in 5 10% of the patients with autism. Conventional karyotype analysis has revealed that chromosomal structural aberrations such as  translocation, inversion, deletion, and duplication play a role in causing autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Unfortunately, there is not a single specific biological marker clearly responsible from autism. Array CGH is a molecular karyotyping method remarkable with fast analysis and highly sensitive diagnostic value.We aimed to use this technology to screen autistic patientÃ¢ÂÂs whole genome in order to investigate new dchromosomal abberations. m A t ER i AL AND  m E t HOD: We isolated DNA samples of 35 primary autism patients between 0 18  years(median age:8.5).DNA samples which labelled according to the protocol, were hybridized with CytoSure Syndrome Plus(v2) 4x44K (Oxford Gene Technology, Oxford, UK) microchips and scanned with Agilent Microarray Scanner( Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA ). Obtained data were analyzed using Cytosure Analysis Software v.2.0.8 software(Oxford Gene Technology, Oxford, UK).RE s UL ts : We found 16p13.11 deletion in thirteen patients, 16p11.2 deletion in twelve patients, 1q21 deletion in ten patients, 2q21.1 deletion in eight patients, 2p21 deletion in seven patients, 8p23.1 deletions in seven patients. c ON c LU si ON: Accordig to these data, we can postulate that 16p13.11 region  and related genes also represent a predisposition to autism in our patients.

336,1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples. Two patients have a paternally  inherited microduplication between the genes GABRA5 and GABRG3 whereas other two patients have a maternally inherited duplication within the D15S1021 marker. All the other duplications are the novo microrearrangements. Using quantitative PCR, PFGE, additional microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the region we are currently deÃ¯Â¬Âning the size of these rearrangements, which should help to delineate the relationship between 15q11 q13 alterations and autistic disorder.",2005,,"Cerrato , M.

3162,457,B Evidence for altered calcium signaling and altered mitochondrial function in an autism case study,P09.025,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodeve  lopmental disorders characterized by de ï¬cits in social interaction, communication, and stereotypic behaviors. While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER. This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore. To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com  pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases. The subject âs transcriptome showed increased expression (>5sd) of genes including the ATP2A3 calcium pump and purinergic receptors, and extremely lowexpression (>24sd) of VDAC2, a mitochondrial calcium uptake channel. These ï¬ndings corroborate suggestions of mitochondrial dysfunction in her clinical biochemicalassays and are extended with Seahorse XFp assays. R.L. Nguyen: None. P. Flodman: None. M. Smith: None.
