5,443,Preliminary Findings In The Diagnostic Evaluation Of A Sample Of 103 Individuals With Pervasive DevelopmentDisorders,P0341., E. Steiner   M. M. Guerreiro  A. P. Marques de Faria Unicamp  Campinas  B,Pervasive development disorders (PDD) are a heterogeneous group ofneurobehavioral disorders of infancy. In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD  a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation  screening for inborn errors of metabolism  karyotypein folic acid deficient medium  and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation.Until now  the following conditions were detected  Down syndrome (n = 3) untreated phenylketonuria (n = 2)  Rett syndrome (n = 2)  tuberous sclero sis (n = 1)  fragile X syndrome (n = 1)  5 other dysmorphic conditions  2non genetic etiologies  and 2 individuals with chromosomal polymor phisms. Besides those  4 individuals presented no PDD and 3 individualshad infantile psychosis. These data suggest that  in at least 15% of thissample  a main etiologic factor could be identified. Although the diagnosisof a specific genetic condition do not modify the treatment of autistic indi viduals in most cases  it is of significant importance to the genetic coun seling of their relatives. For this reason  we reinforce the importance ofcareful dysmorphologic examination and complementary tests in any per son presenting with PDD  besides neurologic and psychiatric evaluation. ,2001,dgmfcm@unicamp.br,,,In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with  PDD a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation screening for inborn errors of metabolism karyotypein folic acid deficient medium and molecular test for the  FRAXA mutation.,,autistic behavior

Brondum NielsenJohn F. Kennedy Institute  Glostrup  D,The subtelomeric regions are often involved in chromosomal rearrange 172 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyments. They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients  all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism  andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found  A 1pter deletion  resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR  growth retardation  and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR  epilepsy microcephaly  and dysmorphism  consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR  microcephaly  an atrial septum defect  and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients.In conclusion three out of 41 (7.3%) patients with idiopathic MR were foundto have subtelomeric rearrangements  in concordance with the prevalence(5 10%) in previous studies. ,2001,els@kennedy.dk,,,Two groups of patients all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism andwith at least one other relative affected with autism.,patient with autism,

Even before the causative gene for this syndrome was identified  pedigree studies indicated that it was likely to be an X linked dominantdisorder  with presumed lethality in males. Nonetheless  there were a fewdescriptions of males suspected of having Rett syndrome. These includesporadic cases meeting the clinical inclusion criteria  sporadic males withKlinefelter syndrome (47 XXY)  and males with severe neonatalencephalopathy in known Rett syndrome families. With the recent discov ery that the MECP2 gene on Xq28 is the gene responsible for most casesof Rett syndrome  it is possible to molecularly assess cases suspected ofhaving male Rett syndrome by direct sequencing analysis. We describethe first 4 cases of molecularly confirmed cases of Rett syndrome in Israel.One of the families presented here consists of a female having classicalRett syndrome and a male sibling with severe neonatal encephalopathy.Molecular analysis revealed that both sister and brother have the sameMECP2 gene mutation  however their mother does not  suggestinggermline mosaicism. The case emphasizes the point that maternalgermline mosaicism may lead to affected female or male offspring  whichshould be taken into consideration during genetic counseling regardingrecurrence risks  and suggests that prenatal diagnosis may be warrantedin siblings of apparently sporadic cases of Rett syndrome. It also highlightsthe importance of molecular diagnosis in every case of idiopathic neonatalencephalopathy in males. ,2001,aviorr@tasmc.health.gov.il,,,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized bycognitive and adaptive regression with autistic features loss of acquiredskills like speech and hand usage stereotypic hand movements epilepsy ataxia and deceleration of head growth that almost exclusively affectsfemales.,regression with autistic,autistic feature

Clas sical RS features seem to occur almost exclusively in females  with an esti mated prevalence of one in 10 000 15 000 female birth. The vast majori ties of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin  and are due to de novomutations. Mutations in the Methyl CpG Binding protein 2 gene have been identified in roughly 75 % of classical Rett girls. We collected DNA samplesfrom 42 Italian classical Rett girls  and screened the MECP2 coding regionfor mutations by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography(DHPLC)  and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently devel oped method for mutation screening combining high sensitivity  reducedcost per run and high throughput. In our study  16 different de novoMECP2 mutations  seven of which were previously unreported  were foundin 32/42 Rett girls (76%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized ina total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identifi cation of 14/16 different mutations (87%)  after optimal conditions wereestablished  this figure increased to 100%  with all recurrent MECP2 muta tions generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Standardizationof DHPLC reagents and methods seems to be critical to the reliability andaccuracy of mutation prediction. Detailed analysis of signature shape retention time  and retention time differences between peaks will allow sig nature based sequence identification  at least for the most commonMECP2 mutations and SNPs. ,2001,talycarella@tigem.it,,,Rett  Syndrome is an  X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disordercharacterized by several clinical abnormalities such as progressiveencephalopathy autistic behavior and stereotyped hand movements.,,autistic behavior

A two stage genome search by IMGSAC (1998)identified regions on six chromosomes (4  7  10  16  19  22) with the regionon chromosome 7q31 q35 as the most significant result (maximum multi point lod score (MLS) of 2.53). In a follow up fine mapping of chromosome7q was carried out by typing 104 additional markers in the interval D7S524 D7S483. Association studies using linkage disequilibrium analysis in theconsortium sib pair and the German singleton sample provided furthersupport for an autism susceptibility locus on chromosome 7q. In parallel screening of several neurotransmitter system genes located in othergenome regions were performed in the German singleton sample  but didnot reveal a clear candidate. ,2001,ingdoms.klauck@dkfz.de,,,Association studies using linkage disequilibrium analysis in theconsortium sib pair and the  German singleton sample provided furthersupport for an autism susceptibility locus on chromosome 7q.,,autism susceptibility

Poustka Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum  Molecular Genome Analysis  Heidel berg  G,Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic componentas shown in family studies. The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line. In order to determine the exact localizationand orientation of the duplication FISH experiments using several YACswere performed. ,2001,ermanyk.beyer@dkfz.de,,,One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients.,,autistic patient

37,23,The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families.

37,23,The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families.

40,123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test  and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and  analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose.  Control hybridizations with normal male to male, male to female and  female to female reference samples were performed and showed  the expected results.

The  syndrome also includes pedantic and monotonic speech and highly  circumscribed interests in topics such as the weather and railway  tables or maps. We have identified two non related patients with AS both with  apparently balanced reciprocal translocations with breakpoints  in 17p13.

In the first group, 21 mutations were identified ; in the second, 8  mutations and zero in the third group. These results confirm that the  vast majority of mutations in the MECP2 gene lead to a classical Rett  syndrome phenotype. They also show that a large proportion of girls  with a severe mental handicap are not found to be associated with a  MECP2 mutation on the contrary to what was recently proposed in  the litterature. In addition, we did not find any genotype phenotype correlations for  the Rett syndrome patients taking into account the mutation type, the  functional domain affected by the mutation and the X chromosome  inactivation status of these patients except for the mutation involving  the C terminal domain associated with a ÃÂ« forme frustre ÃÂ» of the  disease.

Results: Children with BBS showed elevated levels of internalising problems  including feeling withdrawn and anxious/depressed. They also had  elevated levels of social, thought and attention problems. A significant  minority scored in the clinical range on a measure of autistic  symptoms, although none met clinical diagnostic criteria. The children  also had elevated scores on a measure of repetitive behaviour and  the majority was reported to be obsessive by their parents.

58,314,Analysis of One Year of Referrals for Undiagnosed  Developmental Delay.,P223.,,"Undiagnosed developmental delay is a common reason for  referral to a genetics clinic. One year of referrals for undiagnosed  developmental delay to South West Thames Department of Clinical  Genetics was analysed to establish the overall diagnosis rate and  observe the types of diagnoses that are being made. In addition the  data has been examined to ascertain any variables in the history or  examination that may predict the department findind an underlying  aetiology. The investigations undertaken have also been scrutinised  to see which are giving a high diagnostic yield. The overall rate for establishibg a firm diagnosis was 29% with an  additional 12% of patients having tentative or partial diagnoses being  made. It is not suprising that a genetics department is not diagnosing  Downs syndrome, but perhaps unexpected that there is only one  case of a microdeletion syndrome in the list of patient diagnoses. Analysis of features evident from initial history of examination  that predict an aetiology being established show the presence of  dysmorphic features and a milder level of delay to be the only factors  with positive predictive value. The presence of autistic features,  positive neurology (inc. microcephaly, macrocephaly, epilepsy) other  system anomalies (eg cardiac etc)were all found not to have any  predictive value in whether or not a firm diagnosis would be made. Analysis of the investigations that had been useful in establishing  a diagnosis showed X rays, skin chromosomes, opthalmological  opinion and haematology to have been the most diagnostically  helpful, and telomeres the least.",2003,,C.

There have been occasional reports of hyperphosphatasia associated with progressive postnatal neurodevelopmental disease and seizures (MIM#239300). Affected children exhibit consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) of uncertain origin. There are no other laboratory Ã¯Â¬Ândings of note and no evidence of any abnormality of bone or liver metabolism, or altered skeletal architecture. Affected siblings and/or consanguinity suggest autosomal recessive inheritance, but the underlying pathogenesis is  unknown.We describe a new case and review the clinical features in the context of 16 previously reported children. Our proband is a 5ÃÂ½ yr old girl born to consanguineous parents, who presented with marked developmental delay and dysmorphic features (brachycephaly, coarse facies, hypertelorism, bulbous nose with prominent nasal bridge, and downturned corners of the mouth) at Ã¯Â¬Âve months of age. Subsequently, failure to thrive, acquired microcephaly, and autistic behaviours were observed. Seizures and an abnormal EEG were also seen. The hyperphosphatasia (867ÃÂ±72 IU/L, n=7) is associated with decreased pyridoxal 5Ã¢ÂÂ phosphate (B 6), and the question of aberrant vitamin  B6 metabolism has been raised in this condition before. Pyridoxine  challenge (100 mg bolus) resulted in normalized EEG activity. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs tonic clonic and absence seizures have not been evident since phenobarbital withdrawal and treatment with 100 mg pyridoxine daily. Our case illustrates two points: 1) alkaline phosphatase should be assayed in children presenting with similar Ã¯Â¬Ândings; 2) pyridoxine EEG challenge should be attempted to determine whether other affected children show pyridoxine responsiveness.",2005,,"M.

One of the genes associated with CHD is the  NKX2 5 gene, which encodes a  cardiac homeobox transcription factor. Mutations of NKX2 5, which  is located at 5q35.1 have been identiÃ¯Â¬Âed in a subset of familial and sporadic cases of atrioventricular (AV) conduction block associated with a spectrum of structural heart defects, including atrial septal defect (ASD) and tetratology of Fallot. Functional studies of  NKX2  5 mutations have indicated that haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency determines the AV conduction block and ASD phenotypes. However, some studies suggest dominant negative effects and it has not been possible to correlate other  NKX2 5 phenotypes with a speciÃ¯Â¬Âc mechanism of the  mutation due to a small sample size.Here, we present delineation of a microdeletion in a patient with AV conduction block, ASD and tricuspid valve malformation (Ebstein anomaly) in addition to microcephaly, scoliosis and pectoral hypoplasia. FISH mapping of an apparently balanced inversion, 46, XY, inv(5)(q13q35) de novo, revealed a 2.2 megabase deletion  at the distal inversion breakpoint. This region contains 17 RefSeq genes, including  NKX2 5. This case gives therefore strong evidence  for haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency of NKX2 5 as the cause of Ebstein anomaly.

BARCODE (Basic ASD Regression for COmparative Dating Estimates), applies a comparative dating approach free of assumptions on STR mutation rates to detect the linear accumulation of ASD over time. Its power relies on the exploitation of the UEP deÃ¯Â¬Âned phylogeny, which provides a unique solution for the order of nodes in the tree to be analysed. The set of possible solutions to be tested for ASD TIME linearity is created through an algorithm speciÃ¯Â¬Âcally created. The more the phylogeny has a nested shape, the more the dating result is robust. BARCODE allows to weight each lineage according to its frequency in the dataset, a fundamental option Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology348 when the sampled lineages include variants supposed to be ancestral  to a demographic expansion or when dealing with data unbalanced in  sample size.We report the results obtained by running BARCODE on published Y chromosomal data sets. The relative dating estimates are in general agreement with the absolute estimates originally published. The results also allow inferences on STR mutation rates (ASD TIME regression slopes): some critical loci emerged, which show variable mutation patterns across the data sets. However, most STR loci show a similar behaviour across the data sets, thus conÃ¯Â¬Ârming their informativeness. The most commonly used STR loci can then be ranked in different classes, according to their mutation rates, independently on the  particular data set considered.Work supported by PRIN MIUR 2003.",2005,,"Luca1, M.

They usually are inherited, but can also  occur as de novo  mutations, that are much rarer entities . We report on a male patient showing developmental delay, minor dysmorphic features and autism . Standard cytogenetic analysis  revealed that he carried a de novo  apparently balanced translocation,  t(1;5)(q23;q22). Searching for cryptic chromosome abnormalities, YAC  clones in the region of the chromosomal breakpoints were selected and used as FISH probes . The patient showed a deletion in chromosome 1 from q23 .3 to q24 .2, with a loss of about 8 Mb . In an attempt to further  characterize the deletion, with the aim to delineate a better genotype  phenotype correlation, whole genome screening was conducted using array based CGH analysis, at a resolution of 75 kb . The array CGH  data confirmed a cryptic deletion in the q23.3 to q24.2 region, without  other imbalances. The breakpoints were better refined and the size of the deletion was evaluated in 4 .97 Mb . When an individual carries an apparently balanced de novo   rearrangement, the risk for phenotypic abnormalities is significantly  higher than for an individual who has inherited a similar rearrangement from a normal parent . A number of different mechanisms can be responsible for the abnormal phenotypes .

We have examined 254 children with delayed speech/ MR/ autism/ family history of MR or autism . We have  applied a diagnostic score for children and selected 103 cases that were tested with antiFMRP test (done both on hair root and blood cells) .  Following the identification of the affected children, we have examined their families to identify new cases . Finally, 15 affected individuals  were identified. Results in both immunohistochemical methods were concordant . We present the clinical features of these cases, as well as a statistical analysis of their frequency  . The occurrence of different  clinical and behavioral features at different ages will be provided . Based on our cases, the diagnostic score for children will be analyzed . We  found that the method on hair root is less traumatic for the patient and  we were able to reduce the amount of necessary reagents (15 times), reason why we decided to use this technique for future practice .

114,888,Identification of gene(s) involved in autosomal recessive autism spectrum disorder (AsD),P0871.,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by  deficits in social interaction, impaired communication, and unusual and repetitive behaviors and interests . Previous segregation analyses of  autism have revealed that some subsets of autism may be caused by autosomal recessive mechanism . Consanguineous pedigrees facilitate  the recognition and mapping of recessively inherited neurological disorders . The goal of this study is to use the Arabic Middle Eastern  populations to map and identify autosomal recessive autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) genes in order to better understand their classification, pathogenesis, and potential treatments . We so far have recruited 65  consanguineous families with autistic children, 20 out of which are multiplex families . SignatureChip Human Genome Microarray were  performed on probands from 35 families, and chromosomal anomalies  were detected in 6 cases; interestingly, all patients with chromosome  deletions or duplications were from families with one affected individual,  underscoring the importance of cytogenetic testings in ASD, especially in families with one affected child . Moreover, the male:female ratio in multiplex families was 2 .8:1 (37 males:13 females), which appears to be lower than the typical male:female ratio of 4:1 . These data support  our hypothesis that ASD in some families may be caused by autosomal recessive inheritance . Linkage analyses were conducted in multiplex families . One family maps to the  AUTS1  locus on chromosome 7q,  whereas others map to novel autism loci with multipoint LOD score of 2 .4 2 .78 generated from single families without pooling .

Furthermore the boy suffers from seizures since the age of 16 years.  Intelligence is in normal range. The patient finished non classical secondary school with good marks.  Afterwards he tried to graduate from expert school for social sciences which could not be  completed because of his special defects in social competence and  communication skills, and his deficiency of empathy which, at the end  of the initiated diagnostic procedure, led to the diagnosis of Asperger  autism. Since recent studies (1) were able to show a defined interstitial dupli   cation of chromosome15q11 13 in a few patients with autism disorder  (1 3%) we investigated this region with respect to this abnormality . We were able to show a duplication of the region of interest with the  proof of three alleles for the internal markers D15S122, D15S822 and  D15S1234. Furthermore we could confirm this result with FISH using the probe  GABRB3 (15q11 12),which showed three signals on meta  and inter   phase chromosomes. Parental investigations (FISH and molecular analysis) were inconspic   uous. Microsatellite analysis showed that the duplication did arise from  the boy`s maternal chromosome 15, as described in the literature (2). The proposed mechanism is misalignment in maternal meiotic recom   bination.

126,304,Phenotypic features of males with mental retardation  (MR) and mutations of the MECP2 gene,P0167.,,"The MECP2 gene causes Rett syndrome (RS) (OMIM: 312750), a  well defined X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder affect   ing primarily girls. Until recently RS was considered lethal in males,  although now approximately 60 cases have been reported. Males with  MECP2 mutations present with a broad spectrum of phenotypes rang   ing from neonatal encephalopathy to non syndromic MR. Five males (aged 3 16 years) evaluated for MR, had normal karyotype  and four of them were evaluated for molecular variation associated  with the FMR1 locus, with negative results. Patient 1 presented with  features of FXS, including long face, protruding ears and behavioral  problems. Patient 2 had spasticity, pyramidal signs and trunk stereoty   pies, while his brother (Patient 3) showed slight psychomotor retarda  tion. Patients 4 and 5 presented with autistic features. MECP2 analysis  of the exons 3 and 4 was performed by Denaturant Gradient Gel Elec   trophoresis, sequencing and GAP PCR, using specifically designed  sets of primers. The polymorphism p.T203M was identified in Patient 1, but not in  his mother, raising questions about its contribution to the phenotype.  Patient 2 and 3 had a novel deletion at the deletion prone region of  MECP2 (c.1140del86) inherited from their unaffected carrier mother.  The GAP PCR in Patient 4 showed evidence of a large rearrangement  encompassing exons 3 and 4, which requires further evaluation. His  mother was normal. Patient 5 presented the p.R106W classic RS mu   tation, although his mother was unavailable for analysis.

127,320,Minor physical anomalies in children and teenagers with  neurological disorders,P0183.,,"Minor physical anomalies are defects that in themselves, have neither  medical, nor cosmetic importance. They may occur even in healthy  individuals. The incidence of minor anomalies has been studied in  search for a relationship between different non syndromic diseases  and abnormal embryogenesis. They are used as indicators of altered  embryonic differentiation. Their positive correlation with disturbances  of neurological development occurring during embryogenesis has  been established. Patients with mental retardation, cerebral palsy and  autism were evaluated for the presence of minor anomalies. Data were  compared with those obtained from a control group. The frequency of  the minor anomalies was not significantly different in the two groups.  When expressing the mean values as minor anomalies per child, the  figures were 2.92 in affected individuals and 1.43 in the healthy ones. A  positive correlation with the severity of mental retardation was noticed.  64% of the cases with cerebral palsy and 56% of the patients with  autism had at least three minor anomalies.

In 1993, Mehes described a Hungarian family  with three patients, a mother and her son and daughter, presenting  delayed speech development, facial asymmetry, strabismus and trans   verse earlobe creases (TEC). In 2005, four new unrelated Hungarian  children were reported with similar features. We describe a new patient, of Spanish and French origins, who pres   ents a similar phenotype. The girl was the eutrophic product of a 36 week gestation. No motor  delay was observed but delayed speech marked the development of  the girl. At 4 years autistic behaviour was suspected and psychiatric  therapy was instored. The proposita began to speak at 5 years and her  course was marked by mild mental retardation with anxious behaviour. At 20 years, weight, height and OFC are in the normal range. The  patient presents facial asymmetry, narrow down slanting palpebral fis   sures, low set ears with TEC. She has umbilical hernia and hyper   trophic small labia. Skeletal X rays were normal, cerebral MRI shows  abnormal signal of right putamen. Chromosome studies : metaphase karyotype, subtelomeric analysis (MLPA), and FISH studies (22q11.2,  11p15) showed no anomaly. Molecular analysis for Beckwith Wiede   mann syndrome was also normal.

Among the three genes of the minimal critical region (from  centromere to telomere: SHANK3 , ACR  and RABL2B ), SHANK3  is  considered to be at the origin of the neurobehavioral symptoms. We report a child with a de novo  interstitial 22q13.3 deletion detected  by MLPA and confirmed by FISH. She demonstrates mental retardation, severe speech delay, epicanthic  fold, and protruding ears with normal growth. This non specific pheno   type is concordant with the classical presentation of 22q13.3 deletion  syndrome. Subtelomeres analysis by MLPA showed a discrepancy between the  P036B and P070 kits (MCR Holland): P070 MLPA probe (targeting  ARSA  gene) showed a deletion but P036B (targeting RABL2B  gene)  showed a normal result. FISH analysis using LSI TUPLE1 /LSI ARSA   (Vysis) probes confirmed deletion of ARSA , whereas FISH with N25/ N85A3 (Cytocell) probes, targeting SHANK3  locus was normal. This  was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR of exons 23 and 24 of  SHANK3 . Supplemented FISH analysis using BAC clones were per   formed to delineate both breakpoint regions of the interstitial deletion. These data highlight the difficulty of performing an appropriate test in  order to search for cryptic 22q13.3 deletion.

139,985,Mutations in the MECP2 gene in patients of Slavonic  origin with Rett syndrome,P0852.,,"Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder  affecting almost exclusively females. It has an incidence of 1:10,000  female births and is characterized by apparently normal development  for the first 6 18 months of life followed by the loss of acquired motor  and language skills, autistic features, and development of stereotypic  hand movements. Rett syndrome is caused primarily by de novo mu   tations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Methyl  CpG binding protein 2 plays important roles in the regulation of gene  expression and RNA splicing. Here we report the mutational analysis  of the MECP2 gene in 95 patients from the Czech and Slovak Repub   lics and the Ukraine with classical Rett syndrome. The patients, all  girls, were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing of the entire  coding sequence and the exon/intron boundaries of the MECP2 gene.  RFLP analysis was performed to confirm the mutations that cause the  creation or abolition of the restriction site. Mutation negative cases  were subsequently examined by multiple ligation dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) to identify large deletions. Sequencing analysis  revealed 33 different mutations in 74 patients, and MLPA analysis re   vealed large deletions in two patients. The detection rate was 78%.  One mutation in exon 1 (c.48_55del8) has not been published yet.

140,1043,Evidence for association between HTR1B and males with  Autism Spectrum Disorders.,P0911.,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by  qualitative impairments in communication, social interaction, and  restricted and repetitive patterns of interests or behaviors.

Gene MECP2 (methyl CpG binding protein) gene has  been identified as the disease causing. RTT is one of the most com   mon causes of mental retardation in females . After a period of normal  development usually until 6 18 months of age, affected girls enter a  period of regression, losing speech and motor skills, coincident with  the onset of hand stereotypies, leading to loss of purposeful hand use, which is the hallmark of the disorder  . MECP2 gene is located on chromosome Xq28 and is subject to X in   activation. Gene mutations are identifiable in 80% of classic Rett syn   drome, but less frequently in atypical RTT  . First 10 unrelated patients (including 2 boys) with developmental delay and autistic features were referred for molecular diagnostic . Genomic  DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes . MECP2 coding exons 2, 3,  and partly exon 4, were amplified in 7 overlapping PCR fragments and  analyzed by direct sequencing on ABI 310 genetic analyzer  . No previ   ously reported mutations were found in analyzed fragments . Studies  of remaining part of MECP2 gene exon 4 for most common mutations in TRD domain are in progress .

Under some cir   cumstances the child demonstrates aggressive behavior  . The performed cytogenetic analysis showed pathological karyotype   46,XX,del(X)(p1 .22) . About 85% of the cases with Rett syndrome were caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 1 (MECP2) .

However, the causative muta   tion is still unknown in the remaining 5% of the cases . The complete sequencing of MECP2 and CDKL5 genes revealed no mutations in the affected girl . In addition we sequenced the Aristaless  related homeobox (ARX) gene, mutations in which have been shown  to cause mental retardation either isolated or associated with a broad spectrum of neurological problems . This gene has been mainly affect   ed in boys . As this gene is localized on the short arm of the X chromo   some (Xp22 .13), one of its copies was missing in our Xp deleted girl .

First case, a 12 year old girl, was admitted in our department for neu   rological evaluation because of severe progressive toraco lumbar sco   liosis, which occurred at the age of five. She also presented severe  mental retardation, absence of speech, autistic features, gait difficul   ties with ataxia, hyperventilation episodes, and epileptic seizures . The  second case, a 4 year old boy, was referred to our department for psy   chomotor retardation . He had Ã¢ÂÂhappy puppetÃ¢ÂÂ appearance, ataxic gait, and severe mental retardation . Both children were born from healthy non consanguineous parents . Clinical investigations included neurological evaluation, EEG, and MRI . Chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lympho   cytes, by GTG banding. Locus specific BAC probes for critical region 15q11 13 and control probes were used for FISH analysis . Normal karyotype, and 15q microdeletion was demonstrated in both cases . In the second case, the phenotype was highly suggestive for Angel   man syndrome, while in the first case, a differential diagnosis with Rett  syndrome was considered, especially because of the severe vertebral scoliosis . A diagnosis of Angelman syndrome should be considered in patients  with Rett like phenotype. Molecular investigation of specific genetic  defect allowed, in our cases, the refinement of clinical diagnosis.Financial support: CEEX (Project 150/2006) . Acknowledgements: The authors thank Prof .

Inter   estingly, a similar but possibly slightly smaller deletion on has previ   ously been described in a boy with profound speech delay, obses   sional play and echolalia (K Prescott et al.  2005) . In contrast to the  patient we describe, this boy presented additional malformations like a  cardiac defect (tetralogy of Fallot), a bifid uvula, velopharyngeal insuffi   ciency and short stature . Since autistic behaviour is the only consistent  finding in 2 patients with a similar deletion 5q11.2, the location of this  deletion may identify a gene that is implicated in autism spectrum dis   orders . Furthermore our observation illustrates that array CGH should  be considered as an essential aspect in the genetic analysis of patients  with syndromic ASD .",2008,,"H. Peeters1, A. Crepel1, K.

We present  a 10 year old girl with mild mental retardation, abnormal EEG, and au   tistic behavior, who began to speak at 5 years . She had no dysmorphic features and her brain MRI was normal . Karyotype analysis revealed  a de novo apparently balanced translocation t(6;14)(q16;q22) . Whole  genome array CGH analysis with ~385,000 oligonucleotide probes  (NimbleGen) identified an ~1.48 Mb deletion in 6q16.1. FISH with  BAC clones mapping within and directly flanking the deleted segment  showed that the deletion arose at the translocation breakpoint . Inter   estingly, autism has been linked previously to chromosome 6q16 . The  deleted segment harbors FUT9, GPR63, FHL5, KLHL32, c6orf66, and AK091365 and two predicted genes c6orf167 and KIA0776 . GPR63  is expressed almost exclusively in the brain and encodes a G pro   tein coupled receptor for sphingosine 1 phosphate . The fucosyltrans   ferase 9 gene, FUT9, is highly conserved among humans, mice, rats, and hamsters and is highly expressed in brain during embryogenesis .

Recent studies estimated a rate of 3 5% of  cytogenetic abnormalities involving many different chromosomes in autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) . We report here on two unrelated  males with de novo  translocations, autistic behaviour and psychomotor  delay  . They carry balanced chromosome translocations, respectively a  t(5;8)(q14 .3;q23 .3) and t(6;8)(q13;q23 .2) . A detailed physical map cov   ering the regions involved in the translocations was constructed and  FISH analyses were carried out using BAC clones mapping on chro   mosomes 5q14.3, 6q13 and 8q23. We fine mapped the two transloca   tion breakpoints on chromosomes 8 identifying their positions within a short 5 Mb genomic region . The results of these analyses showed that  breakpoints on chromosomes 8 in both patients do not interrupt any  known gene but both map in a region containing the CSMD3  gene .  No genes were interrupted on chromosomes 5q14 .3 and 6q13 . Tak   ing into account that CSMD3 is expressed in fetal and adult brain, our  observations suggest that this gene is a good candidate for the patho   genesis of ASDs . To exclude an over expression or under expression  of CSMD3  leaded by the rearrangement, we verified the expression  of this gene in the leukocytes of the translocated patient by RT PCR, but any transcript was detected . Future studies, including mutational  analysis of CSMD3 in a large number of patients affected by autism  and behavioural studies on a Csmd3  knockout mouse, will be neces   sary to confirm or decline this hypothesis.",2008,,"C.

175,1155,the BDNF receptor gene NTRK  is a susceptibility gene for  autism,P06.034,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely determined by multiple genes . The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant  transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns  5 6  and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) . Given this evidence for association, we  genotyped these markers in a second population sample of 168 Irish trios . In the combined sample (N,491) we found an association of the  same three SNPs at a more stringent P level (0 .006<P<0 .015), and  found nominal associations with four additional markers in intron  22  23 (0 .0211< P<0.043). Previously we have described a significant in   crease of plasma BDNF levels in approximately 30% of our patients .  We therefore screened NTRK2 exons  encoding ligand binding and  catalytic regions ( exons  6, 7, 12, 18, 20 24) for mutations in 20 autis   tic individuals with increased BDNF levels and 10 controls . No muta   tions were identified in these individuals, and there was no evidence  for association of NTRK2 with plasma BDNF distribution .

175,1155,the BDNF receptor gene NTRK  is a susceptibility gene for  autism,P06.034,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely determined by multiple genes . The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant  transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns  5 6  and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) . Given this evidence for association, we  genotyped these markers in a second population sample of 168 Irish trios . In the combined sample (N,491) we found an association of the  same three SNPs at a more stringent P level (0 .006<P<0 .015), and  found nominal associations with four additional markers in intron  22  23 (0 .0211< P<0.043). Previously we have described a significant in   crease of plasma BDNF levels in approximately 30% of our patients .  We therefore screened NTRK2 exons  encoding ligand binding and  catalytic regions ( exons  6, 7, 12, 18, 20 24) for mutations in 20 autis   tic individuals with increased BDNF levels and 10 controls . No muta   tions were identified in these individuals, and there was no evidence  for association of NTRK2 with plasma BDNF distribution .

182,63,incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in a series of 11  French patients with 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion detected using array cGH.,C02.3,,"Since the large implementation of array CGH in the diagnostic work  up of mental retardation, novel microdeletion syndromes have been  described. In particular, the 15q13.3 microdeletion has been identi   fied in 0.2 0.3% of individuals with mental retardation and epilepsy,  schizophrenia, autism and other neuropsychiatric features. The criti   cal region between BP4 and BP5 contains at least seven genes, in   cluding CHRNA7 , which is considered a good candidate gene for the  epilepsy phenotype. We report a series of 11 patients (8 index cases  and 3 affected parents) presenting a developmental delay and a 1.5  Mb 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion ascertained through 11 French  CGH array platforms. All 8 index cases presented mild to moderate  mental retardation with absent or non specific dysmorphic features.  Only two had seizures, 4 had an abnormal electroencephalogram and  none had an autistic behaviour. One patient presented a highly differ   ent phenotype, including hydrocephaly, joint dislocations, congenital  lymphoedema and notable dysmorphic features associated to men   tal retardation. Familial studies could be performed in 5/8 index pa   tients. Interestingly, all 15q13.3 microdeletions were inherited (3 from  the mother, 2 from the father). The affected parents had mild mental  retardation with epilepsy in one. In particular, the microdeletion was  found in 2 completely asymptomatic mothers. This study is in favour  of incomplete penetrance and more variable clinical expressivity than  previously published. Therefore, the 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion  might be only considered as a risk factor for mental retardation.

Clinically they both presented with dysmorphic features,  moderate developmental delay, sleeping disturbances, and abnormal  behaviour. The boy had low birth weight, short stature ( 4SD), micro   cephaly ( 4SD), high forehead, thin eyebrows with Ã¢ÂÂmedial flaringÃ¢ÂÂ,  strabismus, narrow flat nasal bridge, prominent columella, short flat  philtrum, thin lips, late erupted dysplastic teeth, dysplastic ears, short  fingers and toes, broad 1st toe, delayed skeletal age. He showed dis   tinct externalising behaviour, friendly and continuously smiling. The girl  had autistic behaviour, hypermetropia (+6), no signs of puberty at the  age of 13, and dysmorphism such as hypertelorism, thick eyebrows,  long eyelashes, epicanthic folds, wide pronounced nasal bridge, low  set posteriorly rotated dysplastic ears, long prominent philtrum, thin  lips, hairy skin, sandal gap, broad 1st toe. Chromosome aberrations  were detected by high resolution array analysis, 250k SNPs array (Af   fymetrix) for the 1.48Mb deletion and 244k CGH array (Agilent) for  the 0.28Mb deletion. Breakpoints on chromosome 16 were defined  as 65101151 66582496 (hg18) and 65958487 66235411 (hg18), re   spectively.

However, the introduction of whole genome screening  led not only to the description of new syndromes, but also to the rec   ognition of a broader spectrum of features for well known syndromes.  Here we report on 3 patients presenting with mental retardation and  normal standard karyotype. Patient 1 was a 37 year old male with pro   found mental retardation, severe psychiatric disturbances within the  autism spectrum, non specific dysmorphic features and bilateral reti   nal detachment. 105K array CGH Agilent permitted to diagnose a 1.6  Mb 17p11.2 microdeletion including the RAI1 gene, smaller than the  common microdeletion usually found in Smith Magenis syndrome. Pa   tient 2 was a 31 year old female with mild mental retardation, severe  anxiety, non specific dysmorphic features and short stature with micro   melia (142 cm) and X rays compatible with hypochondroplasia. 105K  array CGH Agilent revealed a 1.4 Mb 7q11.23 microdeletion, similar to  the deletion found in Williams syndrome. Patient 3 was a 6 year old  boy with mild mental retardation, non specific facial dysmorphism and  autistic features. BAC array (Integragen, 1Mb) also revealed a 7q11.23  microdeletion including the ELN gene. Reevaluation in the 3 patients  confirmed that the diagnosis was not possible on clinical grounds and  emphasize that well known genomic disorders can be phenotypically  heterogeneous and more variable than originally thought.

Born at term with normal growth parameters, he demonstrated since  the age of 6 months, growth and weight retardation. Delay in motor  milestones was observed as the child did not sit alone at 9 months. He  had also reduced social interactions. G banding showed the presence of a supernumerary chromosome  (47,XY,+mar), composed, as revealed by high resolution aCGH, of  27 Mb from region 9p24.3 to 9p21.2 and 12,3 Mb from 15q11.2 to  15q13.3. This derivative chromosome [der(15)t(9;15)(p21.2;q13.3)]  was subsequently found to derive from a maternal reciprocal trans   location, very likely originating from a meiotic missegregation of 3:1  tertiary type. Partial trisomy 9p21.2 9pter is not well defined but two patients with an  intrachromosomal duplication of chromosome arm 9p [dup(9)(p21p24)]  demonstrated classical clinical manifestations of 9p trisomy with, in  one case, features overlapping with Coffin Siris syndrome. Duplication of the 15q Prader Willi /Angelman syndrome region is  mainly associated with autistic behavior, mental retardation and de   velopmental delay. Most reported cases with associated clinical symp   toms have been linked to extra copies of 15q11 q13 from maternal  origin, paternally derived duplications being generally associated with  a normal phenotype. Our results also support this observation. Presence of potential extra copies of numerous genes from chromo   some 9p in addition to the duplicated 15q region renders a clinical  prognosis difficult. Further assessments and clinical evolution of the  patient will help to better define the spectrum of effects of the diverse  duplicated genes on the phenotype and on their interactions.",2009,,"F.

The clinical phe   notype associated with the reciprocal duplication however is not well  defined, though speech delay is often mentioned. We present 14 new  7q11.23 cases with the reciprocal duplication of the Williams Beuren  syndrome critical region, 9 familial and 5 de novo . These were iden   tified by either array based MLPA or by array CGH/oligonucleotide  analysis in a series of patients with idiopathic mental retardation with  an estimated population frequency of 1:13.000 1:20.000. Interchromo   somal recombination is the preferred exchange mechanism by which  the duplication arises. The CYLN2  gene within the duplicated region  is approximately 2 times overexpressed in carriers of the duplication.  The expression of the GTF2I  gene, just on the boundary of the dupli   cated region and thus with only 2 intact copies present in patients, was  also significantly increased. Variable speech delay is a constant finding in our patient group, con   firming previous reports. Cognitive abilities range from normal to mod   erate mental retardation. The association with autism is present in five  patients and in one father who also carries the duplication. There is  an increased incidence of hypotonia and congenital anomalies: heart  defects (PDA), diaphragmatic hernia, cryptorchidism and non spe   cific brain abnormalities on MRI.

207,11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,,"People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2   gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth  movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects  of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly  conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and  function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak   ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have  been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010,,S.

Aberrations of chromosome 16q with  clinical relevance have rarely been reported. Interstitial deletions re  stricted to band 16q24.3 have not been reported before Methods: In this study we aimed to characterize the clinical and mo   lecular features of four patients with de novo submicroscopic interstitial  16q24.3 microdeletions ascertained by genome wide array analysis  and to determine the shortest region of overlap (SRO) to identify can   didate genes responsible for their overlapping phenotype Results: Clinical features observed in these patients include facial dys   morphisms comprising prominent forehead, large ears, smooth phil   trum, pointed chin and wide mouth, variable cognitive impairment, au   tism spectrum disorder, structural anomalies of the brain and seizures.  The common region of overlap of the deletions is only 90 kb and com   prises two known genes, Ankyrin Repeat Domain 11  (ANKRD11 ) and  Zinc Finger 778  (ZNF778 ), and is located approximately 10kb distally  to Cadherin 15  (CDH15 ). This region is not found as a copy number  variation in controls. Discussion: We propose that these patients represent a novel and  distinctive microdeletion syndrome, characterized by autism spectrum  disorder, variable cognitive impairment, facial dysmorphisms and brain  anomalies. We suggest that haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11  and/or  ZNF778  contribute to this phenotype and speculate that further inves   tigation of non deletion patients who have features suggestive of this  16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome might uncover other mutations in one  or both of these genes.",2010,,"M.

226,447,cytogenetic abnormalities found among the autism  patients in south india,P03.023,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by clinical,  etiologic and genetic heterogeneity. It is often associated with other  conditions, such as disorders of the CNS (tuberous sclerosis), devel   opmental delay, attention deficit, epilepsy, and anxiety and mood dis   orders. The prime aim of the present study was to identify the chromo   somal alterations found among autism patients in Coimbatore region.  In order to investigate the possible cytogenetic damage to the autism  patients, a G banding method was carried out on the lymphocytes of  26 experimental samples and equal number of controls. In the present  study, Experimentals and controls were selected based on the detailed  questionnaire. volunteers provided blood samples (5 ml) to establish  cell cultures at 72 h. For karyotyping, 40 complete metaphase cells  from each subject were evaluated. The detection of an increasing  number of recognizable syndromes such as fragile X syndrome and  Down syndrome were observed. Also major and minor Chromosomal  aberrations such as deletions, inversion, gaps and breaks were found  among the autism patients. The present study exhibits higher degree  of chromosomal aberrations in experimentals compared to controls  (P<0.001). In conclusion, to point out that, the systematic study of autism is very  rewarding with an accurate diagnosis in the proband and with proper genetic counseling, one can alleviate the misery of many parent and  also can reduce the birth of defected offsprings in the family subse   quently.

228,461,Duplications 20p and 3q as a consequence of familial  complex chromosomal rearrangement,P03.037,,"Balanced complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) are extreme   ly rare. Their carriers have a high risk of primary infertility, spontane   ous abortions or children with unbalanced karyotypes. We report an  unusual case of a familial CCR involving three chromosomes. An 8 year old girl was referred for chromosome analysis because of  heart defect, dysmorphic facial features, mild mental retardation and  autistic features including a delay of speech development. Karyotyping  revealed derivative chromosomes 20 and 22. For further clarification of  the rearrangement, FISH was performed using 20p and 20q subtelo   meric probes. It showed that material from 20p was translocated onto  22p. Array CGH was essential for the identification of the suspected  third partner in this CCR: It showed a 3q duplication of about 16.5 Mb,  and the CCR thus involved chromosomes 3, 20 and 22. Karyotyping and FISH analysis of other relatives indicated that four  members of this family are carriers of a balanced form of this CCR.  These individuals are asymptomatic. Four of their descendants have  two types of unbalanced CCRs. The proband and her maternal aunt  have partial duplications of chromosome 3. Both have similar dysmor   phic facial features and mental retardation, but the aunt is lacking the  heart defect and autism. Two other individuals have partial duplica   tions of chromosome 20. These children are currently very young.  Their mental functioning seems to be normal, but the motor develop   ment is delayed and macrosomia is present in both cases.

230,489,t wo girls with mental retardation and behavioural  abnormalities: is the deletion of the A tXN1 gene on 6p22.3 a  major factor in causing the phenotype?,P03.065,,"6p22 interstitial deletions are relatively rare, with only eight patients  described so far. The clinical phenotype in these patients includes  developmental delay/mental retardation, defects of brain, heart and  kidney, craniofacial malformations and dysmorphic features. The com   mon deleted region, 2.2 Mb, harbouring 12 genes, has been defined  as critical for this syndrome. ATXN1 , located within this interval, has  been suggested as a candidate gene for the mental retardation based  on its expression in CNS and the cognitive impairments manifested in  knock out mice. We report on two patients carrying partly overlapping  de novo deletions within 6p22.3, which are smaller than the ones pre   viously reported. Patient 1 displays mild mental retardation and behav   ioural problems; her 115 kb deletion (chr6:16215803 16332297, hg19)  encompasses only GMPR  and ATXN1 . Patient 2 has severe mental  retardation, autistic features and hyperactivity. Her deletion spans 2.3  Mb (chr6:14545576 16846846, hg19) and includes JARID2 , DTNBP1   and MYLIP , in addition to GMPR  and ATXN1 . Because the GMP re   ductases encoded by GMPR and GMPR2  have redundant functions,  haploinsufficiency of GMPR  is not likely causing the cognitive impair   ments in our patients. We therefore suggest that ATXN1 hemizygosity  is sufficient to cause the mental retardation in patient 1. Furthermore,  additional genes such as MYLIP , which is expressed in brain and has  been shown to have a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, is expected  to contribute to the significantly more severe phenotype of patient 2.Cytogenetics11",2010,,"T.

To test for association between ASDs  and genetic variants in these genes in the Finnish founder popula   tion, we have genotyped 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in eight candidate genes in families with autism (n,142) or Asperger  syndrome (AS; n,121) and performed association analyses. In the au   tism study sample, the most significant association was observed with  an intronic SNP in CDH10 , rs1505874 ( P,0.000066). In the AS study  sample, the most significant association was also observed in CDH10,  but with intronic rs6867043 ( P,0.000774). In a recent GWAS (Wang  et al.  2009), signals with a strong genome wide significance were ob   served in six SNPs located between CDH10  and CDH9 . Results from  our study support the role of CDH10  in ASDs using an independent  sample. To our knowledge, this is the first replicated association be   tween ASDs and CDH10  reported. CDH10 is involved in neuronal cell  adhesion and in the development of synaptic complexes so our results  further support the hypothesis that neuronal cell adhesion are impli   cated in the etiology of ASDs.",2010,,"M.

However, systematic data regarding late onset disorders are lacking.A cohort (N,41) of unselected carriers, that were detected prenatally in the period 1970 2008, was identified in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Register. Using information from national medical registries, we compared morbidity in the cohort to that of a 5:1 matched control group (N,205). Carriers were offered clinical re examination, analysis  with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array, and breakpoint mapping with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Mate pair Analysis.We observed no serious congenital malformations in the cohort. However, the risk of neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders, including mental retardation, learning disabilities, attention and/or behavioral disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and mood disorders, was significantly elevated (19.5% vs. 8.3% among the controls, p,0.04). Analysis for copy number variants >100 kb did not provide prognostic information about late onset disorders. So far Mate  pair sequencing indicate that many affected carriers have complex rearrangements and/or rearrangements that truncate brain expressed genes, including genes known to be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.Our study demonstrated that prenatally detected de novo  balanced chromosomal rearrangements have high risk of late onset neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders but are not associated with congenital malformations.

249,164, Haploinsufficiency of microRNA 137 is associated with intellectual disability in patients with overlapping deletions in 1p21.3.,C15.6,,"Introduction: Genome wide array technologies have led to the identification of several microdeletion and microduplication syndromes and genes involved in intellectual disability (ID). Microdeletions and/or duplications restricted to chromosomal region 1p21.3 have rarely been reported before. Several ID syndromes have been linked to  the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, but there are no previous reports of genome wide array studies that have led to the identification of miRNAs associated with ID.Methods: We characterized the clinical and molecular features of three sibs and 2 non related patients with overlapping 1p21.3 deletions, detected by genome wide array analysis. The deletions in the two unrelated patients were de novo. We determined the shortest region of  overlap (SRO) to identify candidates for the phenotype.Results: Clinical features comprised mild ID and autism spectrum  disorder. The SRO was 1.22 Mb and included one annotated gene, DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency), which was unlikely to cause the phenotype, since no associated metabolic defect was detected. Interestingly, the SRO also comprised microRNA 137 (miR 137), which was shown to be under epigenetic regulation of MeCP2 and involved in adult neurogenesis in previous studies in  mice. Our patients had a significantly altered expression of miR 137 and downstream targets. Furthermore, in mouse synaptosomes we  found significant enrichment of miR 137 at the synapse as assessed by qRT PCR, suggesting a role for miR 137 as a modulator of local translation at the synapse.Conclusion: We propose that these patients represent a novel  microdeletion syndrome that is caused by haploinsufficiency of miR  137.",2011,,"M.

259,354, c haracterization of dysmorphic features in 1q21.1 microduplication syndrome: description of two patients and review of the literature,P02.096,,"Array CGH screening in large patient cohorts with unexplained mental  retardation, congenital anomalies or autism has recently lead to the characterisation of novel microdeletion/microduplication syndromes. The low copy repeats spanning the region 1q21.1 mediate nonallelic homologous recombinations that result in rearrangements of 1q21.1. Recent data suggest that a recurrent 1,35 Mb microduplication on chromosome 1q21.1 predisposes to autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay and mental retardation. Other clinical features include macrocephaly, hypertelorism and a wide range of congenital anomalies. Variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance and non specific phenotypic features associated with 1q21.1 microduplication complicate genetic diagnosis and counselling.We report on two unrelated girls of two and three years old, presenting with developmental delay and similar facial dysmorphism such as  hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, short nose with anteverted nostrils, prominent philtrum and thin upper lip. Head circonferences were in normal ranges. At the age of three, one of them developed behavioral disorder with hallucinations and aggressivity.Array CGH detected an identical 2.5Mb microduplication on 1q21.1, encompassing the minimal critical region of 1.35Mb. Parental origin is undetermined (paternal DNA was not available for analysis).These two additional patients confirm that identification of 1q21.1 microduplication by array CGH should be considered as a predisposition factor for developmental delay and behavioral disorders. We refine the 1q21.1 microduplication syndrome by suggesting a distinctive common phenotype, comparing facial dysmorphic features of our patients with previously reported cases.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology91",2011,,"S.

The inv dup (15) or idic (15) is the most common of the heterogeneous  group of the extra structurally abnormal chromosomes (ESAC). Two cytogenetics types have been identified. One is a metacentric or submetacentric and heterochromatic chromosome, not containing the Prader Willi Syndrome/ Angelman Syndrome Critical Region  (PWS/ASCR) [dic(15)(q11).dic(15)(q11)], can be familial or de novo  and most children show a normal phenotype. The second type has 15q euchromatin including PWS/ASCR [dic(15)(q12 or q13)], that frequently derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis. This condition is associated with an abnormal phenotype, which constitutes the idic(15) syndrome, and is nearly always sporadic.The inv dup (15) displays distinctive clinical findings represented by early central hypotonia and intellectual disability, epilepsy and autistic behaviour. Expressive language is absent or very poor and  often echolalic. Epilepsy with a wide variety of seizures, as a typical Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), can occur in these individuals.

He uses short sentences but with pronunciations difficulties.  Developmental quotient was evaluated at 63 (Terman Merrill). Minor dysmorphic features were observed with upslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, mild retrognathia and protruding upper lip with long philtrum. Growth parameters at 7 years are in the normal range.CGH analysis showed a 2.015 Mb deletion distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. The deletion is maternally inherited. The family belongs to underprivileged socio cultural environment with relatives presenting learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities. Given this blurring familial situation, this deletion was initially considered as being  of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore polymorphic CNV were reported in this region.Two publications (Edelmann et al., 2007 ; J Med Genet 44:136 143 and Ramocki et al., 2010 ; Am J Hum Genet 87:857 865) reported  deletions or duplications distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. These patients exhibit variable expression of epilepsy, learning difficulties, intellectual disabilities (mild to severe developmental delay or intellectual disability with autistic features in some patients) and/or neurobehavioral abnormalities (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and aggression including self abusive behavior and depression).

The first one is the family of a woman, showing a severe and progressive epileptic disorder, who is married with an healthy man and has six children: two girls are healthy, a girl and two boys are affected by autism, while a boy showed partial seizures only twice. The three children with autism show a moderate mental retardation and an EEG with no epileptic alterations. The second family is composed by an epileptic woman married with a healthy man and their child affected by autism.The genetic basis of autism and epilepsy were studied in these  families. In particular, we performed an array CGH analysis to search for pathological CNVs which are common to all affected members of the two families.The study detected a single common region on chromosome 15q11.2, which has already been reported to be either deleted or duplicated in about 1% of epileptic patients. Moreover, the same region was associated with ASDs (autism spectrum disorders). We found a loss of 15q11.2 in all individuals belonging to the first family, while a gain of the region in the two affected members of the second family.Complex traits and polygenic disorders274",2011,,"R.

However, genome wide association studies (GWAS) of ASDs have yielded only modest evidence to support common variation in the aetiology of disorder. GWAS rely upon statistically robust genome  wide significant associations to identify genes and loci of risk. There are considerable modest association signals that do not meet stringent genome wide significance thresholds. These signals may conceal underlying patterns that are important to understanding the aetiology Complex traits and polygenic disorders275 of disease. We have developed a robust method, pedSNP ratio test  (pedSRT) to examine association enrichment in biologically linked gene sets for family based association studies. Using a two stage approach we explore association enrichment in GWA data from more than 2100 families from the Autism Genome Project. Based on estimates  from study sensitive simulation we identify excess of observed and replicated association enrichment. We highlight enrichment for sets of genes involved in diverse biological processes including pyruvate metabolism, transcription factor activation and cell signalling. Many of the genes and processes that show enrichment have previously been examined in autistic disorders and offer biologically plausibility to these findings.

Substantial amount of phenotypic differences between healthy individuals have been attributed to CNVs and they also contribute to disease risk in several human disorders including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Dog  breeds as genetic isolates have recently emerged as a new model for human inherited diseases. Hundreds of genetic diseases have been identified in dogs, many of which are similar to human diseases and are likely to have a similar genetic background. CNVs are expected to play a role in several disease conditions in dogs and contribute to breed specific characters. This study aims to map and catalogue CNVs in 50 dogs from 17 breeds (2 10 dogs/breed) and 3 wolves by comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) using NimblegenÃ¢ÂÂs arrays with 2.1 million probes giving a high resolution of approximately 1 kb  median probe spacing across the canine genome. This density gives considerably higher resolution than previously published studies. A Finnish Boxer DNA was used as a reference for other breeds. The results of this high resolution analysis of the CNVs in a large number of breeds provide important discoveries likely to contribute to several phenotypes in dogs and are being followed up in many cohorts available in the European canine genomics effort, LUPA consortium.

The wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical variability in these disorders suggest a complex genetic etiology, which is consistent with the numerous loci thus far identified by linkage, copy number variation and association studies. Although heritability in all three disorders may be as high as ~80%, the genes responsible for much ESHG Concurrent Symposia  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org12 www.eshg.orgof this heritability remain to be identified. Based on the observed redu  ced reproductive fitness, the relatively uniform world wide incidence, the  increased risk of disease with increasing paternal age and the phenotypic  complexity of each disease, we, and others, hypothesized that a fraction of this missing heritability may be the result of the occurrence of de novo mu  tations affecting any of a large number of genes. In order to test this hypo thesis we first sequenced over 400 synaptic genes in 148 subjects with SCZ, 148 subjects with ASD and 96 subjects with ID. Many likely de novo mutati   ons were identified   these plus relevant functional studies will be presen   ted. Next we sequenced the exomes of SCZ, ASD and ID probands, plus their parents, identifying numerous additional de novo mutations (DNMs). In ad  dition, 1/4 of identified DNMs are nonsense mutations, which is more than  what is expected by chance. Interestingly, some of the identified genes, such  as SHANK3, show deleterious de novo mutations in patients from the three  disease cohorts, suggesting close biological overlap in these disorders.

We describe six patients from three unrelated consanguineous Egyptian families with a novel characteristic brain malformation at the level of the  diencephalic mesencephalic junction (DMJ). Diagnostic testing including  high resolution karyotyping and extended metabolic screening were nor   mal. Brain MRI demonstrated a dysplasia of the DMJ with a characteristic  Ã¢ÂÂbutterflyÃ¢ÂÂ like contour of the midbrain on axial sections. Additional ima ging features included variable degrees of supratentorial ventricular dilata   tion and hypoplasia to complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. Diffusion tensor imaging showed diffuse hypomyelination and lack of an identifiable corticospinal tract. All patients displayed severe cognitive impairment, post natal progressive microcephaly, axial hypotonia, spastic quadriparesis and seizures. Autistic features were noted in older cases. Talipes equinovarus, non obstructive cardiomyopathy and persistent hyperplastic primary vi treous were additional findings in two families. One of the patients required shunting for hydrocephalus, however, this yielded no change in ventricular size suggestive of dysplasia rather than obstruction.

Addi   tionally, deletions within the FMR2 gene were described in handful number individuals with ID.Here we report on a de novo 131 kb deletion of FMR2 gene in a 2 years old boy with a mild developmental delay, behaviour changes, hypotonia, and discrete facial dysmorphism. The deletion, detected by SNP array ana   lysis (Affymetrix 250 K Nsp I), spans between the base pairs 147454718 147586323 (NCBI36). The aberration and its de novo origin were confirmed by MLPA. RNA analysis on the patient showed a 994 bp deletion of AFF2 transcript, resulting in the complete loss of exons 2 and 3.In conclusion, this case report further confirms the role of FMR2 gene dele tions as a FRAXE phenotype underlying mechanism.

313,324, Investigating KBG Syndrome: Partial deletion of ANKRD11 results in the KBG phenotype distinct from the 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome,P02.142,,"KBG syndrome (OMIM 148050) is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by macrodontia, distinctive craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, skel etal and neurologic involvement, and intellectual disability. Approximately 60 cases have been reported since it was first described in 1975. Recently mutations in ANKRD11  have been documented in patients with KBG syn  drome, and it has been proposed that haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11 is the  cause of this syndrome. In addition, copy number variation in the 16q24.3 region that includes ANKRD11 results in a variable phenotype that overlaps  with KBG syndrome that also includes autism spectrum disorders and other dysmorphic facial features. In this report we present a 2 ÃÂ½ year old African American male with features highly suggestive of KBG syndrome. Genomic microarray identified a 154 kb deletion within ANKRD11 . The deletion does  not involve other nearby genes. This childÃ¢ÂÂs mother was mosaic for the same deletion (present in approximately 50% of cells) and exhibited a milder phenotype including macrodontia, short stature and brachydactyly. This family provides additional evidence that ANKRD11 causes KBG syndrome  and the phenotype seems to be dose dependent, differentiating it from the more variable 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome.

324,470,Chromosome kissing in association with the ATR X syndrome,P03.036,,"ATR X (X linked ÃÂ± thalassemia / mental retardation) syndrome is one of the syndromes associated with abnormal epigenetic gene regulation, which  appears males with X linked mental retardation, HbH disease, skeletal ab   normalities, and autistic behavior. ATR X syndrome is caused by a mutation  in the ATRX gene localized on the X chromosome (Xq21.1), which encodes  ATRX protein, one of the chromatin remodeling proteins. However, the  details of molecular mechanism with symptoms of this syndrome are still unknown. Here to learn more about the relationships between nuclear ar chitecture and failure of epigenetic regulation in the ATR X syndrome, we ex   amined characteristics of spatial positioning of following three chromosome arm specific regions by 3D FISH technique; 1) Xq (ATRX gene has mapped on), 2) 16p (HBA has mapped on), and 3) 11p (HBB has mapped on). After  image acquisition by confocal laser scaning microscope, analysis of relative  spatial positioning of three painted regions was performed. The results sho   wed that neighborhood association of particular two chromosome territory  regions called as chromosome kissing was observed with high frequency  between Xq and 16p and between 11p and 16p in cell nuclei from the ATR X syndrome patients, respectively. The frequency of the same combination from the normal individual is approximately halves of them, respectively.

Several patients had  exonic deletions in both NRXN1 and other loci implicated in neurodevelop  mental disorders (CNTNAP2, CSMD3 and the Williams Beuren syndrome  locus) and two patients had duplications of the 22q11.2 locus. Patients with NRXN1 deletions had a range of phenotypes including developmental delay,  learning difficulties, ADHD, autism, speech delay, social communication dif   ficulties, epilepsy, behaviour problems and microcephaly.

This is im portant for setting up a good pre test counseling.Methods: We performed HumanCytoSNP 12 array (Illumina) analysis of un cultured amniotic fluid cells and LTC villi in 344 cases of fetal anomalies after exclusion of the common aneuploidies and triploidy. For correct in terpretation, simultaneous analysis of both parents was performed in most cases. According to our policy, only clinically relevant copy number variants (CNVs) were reported to the clinical geneticist who counselled the parents.Results: On a total of 344 arrays, 36 (10,5 %) CNVs were found that were interpreted as clinically relevant based on current knowledge. 24 (7 %) were most probably causative explaining the ultrasound abnormalities and 12 (3,5 %) were so called Ã¢ÂÂunexpected findingsÃ¢ÂÂ that are most likely not di rectly associated with the fetal anomalies. In the latter cases the involved CNVs were risk factors for mental disability, autism spectrum disorder, schi   zophrenia etc. CNVs involving genes like DMD or BRCA2 were not found so far.Conclusions: These findings stress the importance of a pre test counseling with special attention for this type of risk factors, taking into account that risk figures are based upon postnatal studies and that the prenatal manife station of such factors is not yet studied. In our opinion, the pregnant wo man should get the opportunity to decide whether she wants to be informed about these CNVs, which may potentially complicate decision making on continuation or termination of the pregnancy.",2012,,"J.

339,896, Analysis of polymorphisms in GABRA2 and AUTS2 genes in patients with alcoholism from Russia,P08.02,,"Family, twin and adoption studies have provided evidence of a genetic component (40 60%) in the origins of addictive disorders. One of very few confirmed genetic association findings differentiating alcoholics from non alcoholics is with variants in the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid a2 receptor subunit (GABRA2 ) gene. Also according to the recent genome  wide association study variation in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2 ) was strongly associated with alcohol consumption. Population  stratification and ancestry differences within populations may compromise the success of association studies. Therefore analysis of genes variants in homogeneous ethnic groups is of great importance.We designed a classical case control association study for two polymorphis   ms: rs279858 in GABRA2  and rs6943555 in AUTS2  that were tested for asso   ciation with alcoholism. 307 men with ICD 10 diagnosis of alcoholism (112 Russians, 91 Tatars, 100 Bashkirs), and matched control groups were typed for the above mentioned gene variants using PCR RFLP technique.In Russian population the frequency of individuals carrying the *G allele of  rs279858 polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with early onset alcoholism as compared with the healthy controls (p,0.03;OR,1.40). The carriers of GABRA2*A/*A  genotype were found to be at low risk of al   coholism development (p,0.04;OR,0,57). In Tatars the frequency of AUTS2   rs6943555 *T allele was higher in group of alcoholics with acute alcohol  psychosis (0.74) as compared with controls (0.64). However observed diffe rences were not statistically significant.Our results suggest that GABRA2  genetic variation might be involved in the  development of alcoholism in Russians.

The  study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German). Twenty eight tagSNPs were selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. A significant association, that over   came the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and permutations was obtained with the marker rs7052177 (p, 6.13e 4). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible participation of PTCHD1 rare variants in ASD and  ID, we are currently performing a mutation screening in the Spanish ASD cohort, and in an additional sample of 200 individuals with ID. The prelimi nary results of this study support the involvement of this gene in autism and cognitive impairments.",2012,,"B. Torrico1,2, A. HervÃÂ¡s3, B. Franke4, J. Buitelaar5, C. Freitag6, A.

We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including  GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome. Specifi   cally, duplications were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of speech, and lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features. Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant. We concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients. We now report more convincing evidences that dosage balance at GPRIN2 locus plays a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

As a  consequence, the identification of the genes responsible for these pheno  types remained limited. Using high resolution microarrays, we identified intragenic copy number variations in the CG 1 domain of the Calmodulin  binding Transcription Activator 1 (CAMTA1) gene, segregating with au   tosomal dominant ID with NPCA in two unrelated families, and a de novo  deletion located in the same domain in a child presenting with NPCA. In the ID patients, the deletion led to a frameshift, producing a truncated protein,  while this was not the case for the patient with isolated childhood ataxia.  Brain MRI of the patients revealed a pattern of progressive atrophy of cere bellum medium lobes and superior vermis, parietal lobes and hippocampi.  Although DNA sequencing of the CG 1 domain in 197 patients with sporadic  or familial non syndromic intellectual deficiency, extended to full DNA se   quencing in 50 patients with ID and 47 additional patients with childhood  ataxia, identified no pathogenic mutation, there is considerable evidence  that CAMTA1 rearrangements are being disease causing. Indeed, CAMTA1 is a brain specific calcium responsive transcription factor expressed in the brain and cerebellum during development and later implicated in memory processes; intragenic rearrangements are concentrated in a highly conser   ved functional domain with transcription regulation ability and nuclear traf ficking functions; CAMTA1 transcriptional studies have shown upregulation of genes already implicated in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.

362,1830, Close parental relatedness identified by SNP microarray challenges for genetic counselling,EPL7.5,,"IntroductionMolecular karyotyping by microarray is recommended as Ã¢ÂÂfirst tierÃ¢ÂÂ testing in evaluation of individuals with intellectual disability, developmental de   lay, multiple congenital abnormalities, and autism spectrum disorders. SNP microarrays extend diagnostic scope beyond detection of submicroscopic pathogenic copy number changes by also revealing uniparental disomy, chi merism, chromosomal mosaicism and long continuous stretches of homo   zygosity (LCSH) creating the potential to determine previously undisclosed incestuous relationships, posing legal and ethical challenges for genetic ser   vices.Methods & ResultsSNP microarray was performed on 11000 consecutive samples. LCSH was detected in 1156 samples (10.5%). Close parental relatedness (greater than 6.25% LCSH) was detected in 322 samples (3%), with 4 samples showing homozygosity levels >20%, consistent with a first degree relationship bet   ween parents. Two known cases of first degree unions were detected with homozygosity levels of 17.3% and 19%.DiscussionIdentification of close parental relatedness poses unique ethical and legal challenges for genetic services. Can we reliably differentiate between exten sive LCSH arising from incestuous relationships and consanguineous unions over several generations? How these findings should be reported to avoid inappropriate or insensitive disclosure whilst fulfilling legal and ethical ob ligations, protect the childÃ¢ÂÂs right to privacy, whilst ensuring medically rele vant information is available is complex. We will present the approach our service has developed to deal with results indicating close parental related   ness. Next generation microarrays are likely to combine both the CGH and SNP platforms.

363,4, C terminal deletions of the AUTS2 locus cause distinct syndromic features and cognitive impairment,PL2.2,,"Translocations involving 7q21.22 have been associated with autism and in tellectual disability (ID). Discordant evidence has suggested that these cli nical phenotypes might be driven by a number of genes (AUTS2, WBSCR17, CALN1). Here, we examined whether AUTS2 disruptions are causal for neu  rocognitive defects.An international cohort of ~50,000 patients and 16,000 controls was ex   amined for CNVs in AUTS2 by array CGH and we performed detailed pheno  typic analyses. 5âRACE experiments were performed to test for alternative transcripts in human brain. A zebrafish knock down model was generated to test the potential of different AUTS2  splice isoforms to induce some of the  anatomical phenotypes seen in patients.We found 44 AUTS2 deletions. Microdeletions disrupting the coding se   quence were causal to a complex syndromic ID/autism phenotype including short stature, microcephaly, cerebral palsy and distinct facial dysmorphis   ms. The exonic AUTS2 deletions occur with a frequency comparable to NSD1  deletions causing Sotos syndrome. We also discovered a novel, highly con served, C terminal AUTS2 isoform in human brain. Clinical and functional  studies showed this isoform to be a key contributor to the human phenotype because (a) patients with C terminal deletions exhibited significantly more severe and pleiotropic aspects of AUTS2  syndrome, and (b) the significant  microcephaly and craniofacial defects seen in auts2 knockdown zebrafish  embryos were rescued by this C terminal isoform.We identified a hitherto unappreciated syndromic phenotype caused by deletions in AUTS2,  required for both brain and craniofacial development.  The C terminal portion of the gene contributes significantly to the pheno type, demonstrating how transcriptional complexity can underpin human pathology.  E. Voorhoeve: None. G. Beunders: None. C.

367,158,New genes in epilepsy and its co morbidities: a linkage and whole exome sequencing approach.,C15.2,,"Purpose: The majority of epilepsies are focal in origin, with seizures arising in one region of the brain. The aetiology of most cases of focal epilepsy re mains unknown and has not generally been thought to be genetic. We stu died large pedigrees with forms of focal epilepsy (NFLE and FFEVF) which showed autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance to identify the genes respon   sible and then studied their broader contribution to the focal epilepsies.Method: We used a strategy of whole genome linkage analysis followed by whole exome sequencing in two families with FFEVF mapping to Chromoso   me 22q12 and one large family with ADNFLE mapping to 9q34.3.Results: We detected mutations in DEPDC5 in the two families and sub sequently in 5/6 additional families with FFEVF. Furthermore, we found DEPDC5 mutations in approximately 12% (10/82) of families with non lesional focal epilepsy. A mutation in the potassium channel gene KCNT1 was identified in the family with NFLE and subsequently in three other fami lies with NFLE. Mutation positive family members were also affected with psychiatric features, intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders.Conclusions: Mutations in DEPDC5 account for approximately 12% of cases of non lesional familial focal epilepsy, becoming the most common known cause of familial focal epilepsy. KCNT1 mutations contribute to nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) as well as to psychiatric features. Genetic fac tors therefore play an increasing role in the focal epilepsies.

369,188,Associations between gene expression and phenotypes in 16p11.2 rearrangements,C20.3,,"The recurrent 600kb long 16p11.2 deletion and its reciprocal duplication impact carriersâ cognition and behavior. These rearrangements are asso   ciated with mirror phenotypes such as obesity and underweight, macro  and microcephaly, as well as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Although these imbalances are among the most frequent causes of neuro developmental disorders, the triggered transcriptome alterations and their associations with the aforementioned phenotypes remained unexplored.We generated transcriptome profiles of lymphoblastoid cell lines from 16p11.2 deletion and duplication carriers, as well as controls. The expres   sion levels of the 29 genes mapping to the imbalanced interval correlate to their gene dosage. We observed a greater correlation of the expression levels of KCTD13, MVP and MAPK3, three genes shown to have an epista tic effect on zebrafish head size. To investigate the functional relationship between gene expression levels and phenotypes, we transformed anthro pometric measurements into Z scores. We found that Z scores computed for weight and BMI were significantly associated with MAPK3 and MVP ex   pression after adjustment for copy number status in a multivariate normal linear model for adults. We also show that transcription modules (subsets of genes that exhibit a coherent expression profile) involved in the regula   tion of gene expression, chromatin modification, control of apoptosis and cell division are perturbed in cells of 16p11.2 patients, further confirming the emerging association between âcancer associatedâ genes/pathways and neurodevelopmental disorders.

379,592,Systematic phenotyping of the 16p11.2 600 kb deletion and duplication carriers,P05.007,,"The ~600kb 16p11.2 deletions and duplications are among the most fre  quent genetic etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders. These recurrent  rearrangements are associated with mirror phenotypes such as obesity and  underweight, macro  and microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). In 16p11.2, as well as in other genomic disorders,  reports of variable expressivity and âincomplete penetranceâ have ham  pered genetic counseling and patient management.To better understand this variability, we compared the effects of deleti ons and duplications through a systematic assessment of large cohorts of  16p11.2 rearrangementsâ carriers (Simons VIP and Europe consortia: n,  287 del, 301 dup). The deletion consistently impacts neurodevelopment, regardless of ascertainment. It is associated with a decrease in full scale IQ (FSIQ) of two standard deviations and frequently causes specific language difficulties. Psychiatric co morbidities are present in the majority of carri   ers, and seizures are observed in 24% of deletion carriers. We identified an increased velocity of head circumference growth during infancy, which reca pitulates the well documented pattern seen in ASD. In contrast, duplication carriers have a broader range of IQ when compared with deletion carriers (increased rates of FSIQ below 50 and above 100: OR,3.5, p,0.002): this heterogeneity is associated in part with ascertainment method. The asso   ciation of the duplication with decreased head circumference is similarly influenced by ascertainment, suggesting that the phenotypic heterogeneity might be caused by an interaction between the duplication and other ge netic and/or environmental factors. Additional genetic variants that could underlie these observations are currently under investigation.  S. Lebon:  None. A. Maillard: None. K. Mannik: B.

Microdeletions and microduplications of the distal region  within 1q21.1 are susceptibility factors for a variety of neurodevelopmental phenotypes and distinct dysmorphic features. We present a 6 years old boy with severe intellectual disability, ASD, signi  ficant speech delay, hyperactivity and macrocephaly. He comes from 3rd pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia , diabetes and excessive obesity of the mother ( there were 2 sponatenous abortions from another partnership  of the mother). His early development was delayed  walking unattended at  18 months of age. He exhibits significant facial dysmorphism: macrocephaly with prominent forehead, long face, arched eyebrows, periorbital fullness,  epicanthal folds, broad nasal bridge, upturned nose, deep philtrum . His  extremities are relatively short with short fingers, he also has hypoplastic genitalia. The extent of the duplication of our patient is 2.3 Mb , affecting 32 HGNC  genes, chr1:144.510.930   chr1:146.812.122.(hg18)His father is a carrier of microduplication confirmed by FISH analysis, the exact extend will be confirmed by array CGH method. He has borderline in  telectual capacity, his facial features are almost normal. Consistent phenotypic differences havenât yet been described between people with different sized microduplications   and people in the same fa  mily with the same size microduplication can have very different features.

The syndrome could also comprise autistic features, seizures or thermore gulation problems. Rare symtoms are hearing loss, genitourinary anomalies and congenital heart defect. Extremely rare is association of Phelan McDer   mid syndrome and hepatic failure in early childhood. There have been de  scribed only 2 patients with this condition so far. In these cases PIM3 gene  (localized in 22q13.33) was considered to be responsible. We present 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with Phelan McDermid syn drome. Age at diagnosis ranges from 10 month to 55 years and deletion ex   tent varies from 0.4 Mb to 7.6 Mb. All patients present common features  of the syndrome, but they differ in inconstant sypmtoms. Any correlations  between phenotype and deletion range havenâ²t been observed.Patients have been diagnosed using FISH and MLPA, deletion extents were  proven by oligonucleotide arrayCGH. There are 6 patients with deleted PIM3 gene in our group, including two adult patients, but only one of these patients (10 year old boy with 1.9 Mb  long deletion) has developed hepatic failure recently. Therefore simple PIM3  deletion doesnâ²t seem to be the cause of hepatic failure.The possible mechanism is an alteration of the gene on the other allele, epi genetic factors or mutation in some modifier genes. We discuss potential  benefit of whole exome sequencing to further elucidate mechanism in these  patients.Support: Czech Ministry of Health project 00064203.  R. PourovÃ¡: None. P.

Background: The genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup.

388,648, BKCa channels: a new therapeutic target in Fragile X Syndrome treatment,P05.067,,"The most common cause of inherited mental deficiency (MD) associated  with autistic features, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), results from the FMR1 gene  silencing and loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among synaptic proteins deregulated by the absence of Fmrp in fmr1  knock out  (KO) mice (murine model for FXS), Kcnma1 (Î± subunit of large conductance Ca 2+ activated potassium channels, BKCa) seems to be the most significant  deregulated one. Since several papers showed an involvement of BKCa chan nels in MD, this channel could be a new therapeutic target for FXS. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the molecular BKCa channel anomaly in fmr1  KO mouse model and 2) to evaluate the thera  peutic effect of a BKCa channel opener molecule (BCOM), BMS 204352, on dendritic spines maturation of fmr1  KO neurons and on social behavior of  fmr1  KO mice. In fmr1  KO mice, Kcnma1 protein quantity was lower in ce  rebral structures and neurons, and associated with a reduced BKCa whole cell current. In vitro addition of BMS 204352 induced dendrite spines ma  turation of fmr1  KO neurons. In vivo, using a behavioral test of direct social  interaction, a single injection of BMS 204352 rescued affiliative behaviors to wild type level. In conclusion, we demonstrated 1) a Kcnma1 protein anomaly in fmr1  KO  mice inducing a decrease in BKCa whole cell current, and 2) that a BCOM, BMS 204352, restored a regular phenotype of dendrite spines and social interaction in fmr1  KO mice. Therefore, BKCa channel could be a new thera  peutic target in FXS treatment.  B. Hebert: None. O. Perche: None. A. Menuet: None. N. Doisne: None. J. Pichon:  None. B. Laudier: None. S.

390,651,Study of a large Spanish cohort of 22q13 deletion syndromeÂ´s patients. A genotype phenotype correlation?,P05.070,,"Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the deletion or disruption of a 22q13 region containing the post synaptic protein gene SHANK3 . The clinical features of PMS (also known  as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and otherdevelopmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmor   phic features. Other less frequent features include seizures, brain, renal and cardiac malformations, motor deficits, and lymphedema Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, Clinical expression also varies widely, even among patients with small deletions, and no correlation between deletion size and phenotype has been found. A role for additional genetic factors, in addition to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, is likely. Because PMS is considered  to be underdiagnosed, the true prevalence is unknown. Aims. We aim to define a possible genotype phenotype comparison to use  high resolution deletion breakpoint mapping on a large cohort of patients, addressed the hypothesis that additional genes or regions of chromosome  22q13 besides SHANK3 may contribute to the PMS phenotype. Results. Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for more than 50  individuals in a patient cohort using a custom designed high resolution oli  gonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform, prompting  this genotype phenotype association study. Most of them have been studied by FISH, MLPA and array CGH and their clinical features have been defined.  Interestingly, a great genetic variability, with deletion sizes between 10 Kb  and as much as 9 MB was found.Conclusions.

392,654," Identification of a novel missense mutation in HUWE1 (Xp11.2) segregating with intellectual disability in a large family, by Targeted High Throughput Sequencing.",P05.073,,"Genetic diagnosis in Intellectual Disability (ID) remains difficult because of the extreme genetic heterogeneity of this frequent condition. We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p.Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family. A functional test of HUWE1   activity on DNA repair is currently performed on patientâs cells to confirm its pathogenicity.  Y. Alembik: None. J. Lauer Zillhardt:  None. B. Gerard: None. C.

396,670, Further delineation of medical and behavioural aspects of the KBG syndrome caused by ANKRD11 mutations,P05.090,,"Introduction Recently ANKRD11  mutations were identified as the cause of  KBG syndrome, an autosomal dominant intellectual disability (ID) syndro me with specific dental, craniofacial and skeletal anomalies. To further ex   pand the phenotypic spectrum and knowledge on medical and behavioural  management, we present a comprehensive overview of clinical and molecu  lar characteristics of nine so far unreported cases from five different families  with ANKRD11  aberrations. Methods Clinical features of nine cases with KBG syndrome were evaluated  and a review of the existing literature on KBG syndrome was performed.  Sequence analysis of the ANKRD11  gene was performed using Sanger se   quencing. An Affymetrix CytoScan HD array was used according to the  manufacturerâs protocol. Results In the first family a heterozygous frameshift mutation in ANKRD11   was identified in four affected children as well as their mother. Three other  isolated KBG syndrome patients all harboured frameshift mutations in AN  KRD11 . Microarray analysis revealed a 100 kb deletion encompassing exons  1 3 of the ANKRD11  gene in one patient. Discussion Hallmark characteristics of KBG syndrome are mild to mode   rate ID, macrodontia and other dental anomalies, skeletal anomalies, short  stature and typical dysmorphic features. Less common features are heart  defects, palatal defects, hearing loss, ophtalmologic abnormalities and cen tral nervous system involvement. Neurobehavioural problems, especially autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, are often present but gained less attention so far in medical literature. However, we observed that these can be severe and require adequate management. Better recognition, a multidisciplinary approach and early intervention are essential to patients and their families.

In the present stu dy we used real time PCR, western blotting and HPLC to compare the GABA and Glutamate metabolism in several key areas of the Mecp2 mutant mice  brain at different developmental stages (early and late symptomatic). Key  enzymes (Kcc2, Nkcc1, Vglut1/2, Gad1/2) will be considered. In conclusion, our results revealed a spatial and temporal deregulation of the glutamater   gic and gabaergic systems for all levels of regulations studied. Moreover, we found that pharmacological stimulation of the gabaergic system is efficient to improve the lifespan of Mecp2 deficient mice.  R. El Khoury:  None. N. Panayotis: None. A. Ghata: None. V.

Many environmental and genetic factors can cause MR, including premature  birth, prenatal infections, chromosomal abnormalities, and single gene mu tations. Though an etiology can be established in 60 75% of cases of severe  MR, it is only 38 55% in mild cases. Moreover, genetically determined MR  accounts by for 17 to 41% of cases, depending on use of the different tech   niques. In the present study, we report the cryptic genomic rearrangements identified MR cases by selective use of chromosomal microarray. Methodology: Two cases of unexplained MR after initial biochemical, radio  logical and chromosomal evaluation were studied. DNA was extracted from whole blood and analysed on Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 array. Raw data  obtained was analysed with KaryoStudio software. The rearrangements  were checked in DECIPHER database.Results and Conclusion: Both the samples showed a male karyotype and some cryptic genomic rearrangements. First case had multiple rearran gements duplications in the chromosome 7q11.21 (398kb) and 17q12 (186kb), and 1.6Mb hemizygous deletion at cytoband 14q13.3 q21.1. Se cond case was observed to have a duplication of 549Kb at 7q36.2, region as sociated with autism spectrum disorder and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; a 2.6Mb hemizygous deletion at 22q11.21 q11.22 region. All these regions (non recurrent genomic aberrations) have been implicated as pathogenic in several other patients as per DECIPHER database. Thus, chromosomal microarray analysis can help in identifying underlying cause of MR in some apparently unexplained cases, and should be a diagnostic tool for evaluation of MR.  S. Agarwal: None. S.

MedykÃ³w 18,,  Katowice, Poland. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation respon   sible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1  gene resulting in its transcriptional silencing. Leptin may be  considered a cytokine like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, immune system, in addition to its role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. Thus, we hypothesized on in volvement of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of autism.Material and methods23 male patients, mean age 19,3 Â± 6,6, affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1  gene), were enrolled into the study. Controls were 24  healthy males, mean age 21,8 Â± 5,8. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA method.ResultsPlasma leptin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients were similar as in con trol group (11,53 Â± 10,24 ng/ml) vs (5,73 Â± 4,52) were not significantly dif   ferent from those found in controls (p , 0,5).While plasma adiponectin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients (6,68 Â± 3,44 ng/ml) were significantly lower in controls (8,95 Â± 4,24) (p< 0,04).ConclusionAdiponectin may be involved in autistic features observed in FXS patients in light of its anti inflammatory properties.

MYT1L interacts directly with  DISC1, which is involved in schizophrenia. We describe a family in which  the father, his son and his daughter have a 549 kb interstitial duplication in the 2p25.3 region detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and  confirmed by quantitative PCR. This duplication encompasses the five first  exons and is predicted to disrupt the MYT1L gene.

It consists of 13 exons and encodes a  protein of 635 amino acids. This disorder causes an increase of creatine le vels in urine and plasma, and urinary creatine/creatinine ratio. The clinical presentation of males affected is mental retardation, expressive speech and language delay, epilepsy, developmental delay and autistic behaviour.Subjects and Methods: An 8 year old male patient presents learning diffi   culties, behaviour disorder and epilepsy. An increase of creatine/creatinine ratio, guanidineacetate and glycine levels (plasma and urine) was detected. The 13 exons of the SLC6A8 gene, including the intron exon junctions, were  analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction.Results: We detected a 34 pb deletion (c.1016+11_1017 52del34) in intron 6, that was predicted to cause an aberrant splicing into acceptor splice site. At the cDNA level, this mutation produces a 30 pb deletion in exon 7 and a single amino acid insertion (p. K339_S349delinsN). This variant was not detected in the mother and is therefore considered de novo.Discussion: DNA and RNA analysis were necessary to characterize this novel pathogenic mutation. The detected change in the creatine transporter could be responsible for a lower and/or no activity of the protein. Functional stu dies in cultured skin fibroblasts will be necessary to show  a deficiency of the  creatine transporter function.   J. Aguirre Lamban: None. C. Cervera Acedo:  None. E. Sarasola: None.

Comparative genomic hybridization showed a duplica   tion at 15q11.2 q13.1. A similarly affected sister (autism spectrum disorder, anxiety and intellectual impairment) and their clinically depressed mother also carried the duplication. The mother has normal intellect. Another clini cally depressed sibling with normal intellect did not carry the duplication. Methylation studies showed that the duplication had been inherited from the maternal grandfather who had normal intellect and absence of psych iatric disease.Duplication of 15q11 q13 has previously been associated with cognitive impairment, autism, and psychiatric disease. Furthermore, the maternally inherited duplication most likely confers this phenotype whereas paternally derived duplications primarily show normal phenotypes.Our family provides additional evidence that autism, psychiatric disease and intellectual disability segregate with a maternally inherited duplication at 15q11 q13 although with variable presentation. The presence of depression in the non carrier sister however, suggests a lack of association between cli nical depression and the chromosomal duplication in this family, providing evidence that this duplication does not play a strong role in depression.

In a genome wide CNVs screening performed by the AGP , a rare inherited  microdeletion, disrupting two genes transcribed in the same direction,  KLHL23 and SSB, was identified in an Italian ASD individual. This deletion, potentially resulting in a gene fusion transcript, causes a frameshift with the  introduction of a premature stop codon. No fusion transcript was detected  by RT PCR, suggesting that it is subject to ânonsense mediated mRNA decayâ. KLHL23 encodes for a brain expressed Kelch repeat protein of unknown function. While several CNVs affecting SSB are reported in controls making  it an unikely dosege sensitive gene, no CNVs have been previously described  in KLHL23. KLHL23 expression analysis in peripheral blood of the CNV car riers did not show reduction of RNA levels, although we canât exclude that  the deletion could have an effect on the brain. In a mutation screening of KLHL23 in 85 multiplex familis with ASD we identified a damaging variant (M65V), absent in controls, and segregating  with the ASD in an affected sibling pair. Taken together our results suggest that rare variants altering KLHL23 func tion in the brain, could contribute to ASD risk in a small number of cases.  S. Lomartire: None. E. Bacchelli: None. F.

On the other hand, the con  tribution of non heritable genomic alterations to the pathogenesis is hardly  appreciated. Here, we have assessed post zygotic autosomal aneuploidy in prefrontal cortex of the diseased and normal brain by molecular cytogenetic  techniques (FISH and interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding  with DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18). Twel  ve autistic, 19 schizophrenic and 27 control samples provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental disorders, University of Maryland and bank of our institute were analyzed. Aneuploidy rate per autosome was 0.3  0.8% in all three cohorts analyzed (0.46%, 0.62% and 0.59%). However, we  observed statistically significant increase of chromosome 9 aneuploidy in  the autistic brain. In schizophrenia, chromosome 1 and 18 aneuploidy rates were significantly increased. Additionally, we performed array CGH and in silico analysis of our data on genomic rearrangements in childhood neuro  developmental diseases (124 individuals) and found that CNV burdens in  these individuals typically affect two pathways specific for brain cells: cell  cycle regulation and programmed cell death. We concluded that somatic genome variation (chromosome specific mosaic aneuploidy) is a non heri   table genetic factor contributing to pathogenesis of brain disorders, that is,  however, a result of specific CNV burdens.

417,735,Synaptic transmission: looking for clues to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) etiology in Copy Number Variants containing synaptic genes,P06.15,,"Copy Number Variants (CNVs) play an important role in susceptibility to  ASD, often mediated by the deletion or duplication of genes involved in  synaptic structure and function. In this study we tested the hypothesis that  there is an enrichment in CNVs encompassing synaptic transmission genes in ASD.To obtain a list of genes involved in synaptic structure and function, we que ry pathway databases for synaptic pathways (KEGG and GO). By intersecting this list with the results of a large CNV genomic screening in ASD patients (performed by the Autism Genome Project), and CNV information on the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), we found a significantly increased bur den of CNVs encompassing synaptic genes in ASD subjects compared to DGV controls (Fisher exact test P,2.2X10  16, OR,1.47). Detailed analysis of the frequencies of each synaptic gene duplicated or de   leted by CNVs in ASD and control subjects identified 39 genes that were si gnificantly more frequent in ASD (P<0.05). Closer inspection of CNV overlap between the ASD sample and additional control databases (eg SAGE, Pop Gene) highlighted synaptic structure or function genes (eg NF1, GABRG1,  CHRNA7 ) that warrant further investigation. Additionally, 5 synaptic genes,  PLA2G1B, PPP2R3C, KCNK7, ADCY7 and RAPSN , were disrupted by CNVs ex   clusively in the ASD dataset, and were also absent from the additional con trol CNV databases queried.The present results show an excess of structural alterations encompassing synaptic genes in ASD and highlight candidate genes for sequencing and functional studies.

419,737,Targeted high throughput gene sequencing of the NMDA receptor multi protein complex and high resolution genomic study of 100 families with autism spectrum disorder,P06.17,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early childhood neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a significant genetic aetiology and a prevalence  currently estimated at 1/100. Epidemiological studies described that ASDs  are heterogeneous at both clinical and genetic levels, which has been further illustrated by the large number of loci and genes that have been identified to  date (>100). Several biological pathways have been highlighted, particularly  the NMDA receptor multiprotein (NRC) complex, affected by copy number variations (CNV) and mutations enriched in NRC proteins encoding genes.We performed a global genetic study of 100 French families including at least 1 individual with ASD, which was included in the research project âNeurophysiological Molecular and Developmental Analysis of the Glutama   te Synapse in Autism (NMDA Autism)â (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).For each family, we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic compa rative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array for   mat to identify rare or de novo CNVs; Secondly, a high throughput targeted sequencing of 216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene mutations in our cohort.Preliminary results on CGH experiments led us to identify small rare CNVs in several known regions (20p12.1 MACROD2; 18q21.1 KATNAL2; 11p13.11) or novel potential candidates such as FRMPD4, GUCY2F and NXPH3. We have also observed several large genomics variations previously described (1,2Mb amplification at 16p13.11 and 5,6 Mb deletion at 11q14.2 q14.3).

While it is well esta blished that de novo genetic variation plays an important role in ASD risk, recent studies have demonstrated a convincing evidence of a rare recessive contribution to the heritability of ASDs.In the genome wide CNV study carried out by the Autism Genetic Consorti   um (AGP), we identified one homozygous deletion intersecting the CTNNA3 gene in an Italian proband with ASD and moderate intellectual disability (PIQ,50). This deletion includes a coding exon, leading to a putative frames hift and premature stop codon, inherited from both parents, each heterozy   gote for a deletion of slightly different length. The unaffected sister is also heterozygote for the deletion.CTNNA3 encodes for the alfaT catenin protein that has a crucial role in cel lular adherence showing suggestive association in GWAS and a de novo de   letion.Even if the frequency of exonic deletions of CTNNA3 is not significantly dif   ferent between ASDs cases and controls (17/2446 cases and 35/5097 con trols, P,.88), no homozygous exonic deletions were found in a sample of  5097 controls, suggesting that only the complete knockout of CTNNA3 could  cause or confer susceptibility for ASDs. Expression analysis of alfaT catenin and alfaN catenin proteins in mouse cortex and hippocampus (P0 P90), provided further support of a role of CTNNA3 in early mid fetal develop  ment of the brain.

423,749,Genetic syndromes are frequently found in patients manifesting with primary neuropsychiatric disorders and developmental co morbidities,P06.29,,"Litwin Family  Centre for Genetic Medicine, University Health Network and Mount Sinai Hospital,  Toronto, ON, Canada, 3Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences, Whitby, ON,  Canada. Background: Many genetic syndromes present with psychiatric disorders.  We aim to determine the role and prevalence of hidden genetic conditions  in patients with psychiatric disorders and comorbidities. This has the po  tential to significantly impact the standard of care and treatment of selected individuals with psychiatric impairment. Methods: We prospectively recruit  patients â¥16 years of age with psychiatric disorder(s) and at least one of  1) neurologic abnormality, 2) developmental delay (DD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or pervasive DD (PDD), 3) dysmorphic features, 4) conge nital anomalies or 5) family history of DD, ASD or PDD. A clinical database  of phenotypic correlates is being established to delineate the highest yield  data that lead to the most effective and efficient diagnosis of genetic syn dromes in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Results: Of the initial 62 patients recruited, 15 (24.2%) have been diagnosed with genetic condi   tions. This includes seven patients with six different single gene disorders, six patients with six distinct chromosomal variants and two patients with different metabolic disorders. Discussion: Our preliminary results have be gun to demonstrate that genetic syndromes are common in patients with primary psychiatric disorders. Many of the genetic conditions identified in this cohort have implications for medical surveillance, management and, in some cases, treatment. The high diagnostic yield in patients with âpsychia tric plusâ phenotypes demonstrates the significance of psychiatric disorders in genetic syndromes and vice versa. Identifying phenotypic âred flagsâ will enable development of algorithms to make important, possibly treatable, genetic diagnoses in psychiatric patients in a more efficient manner.  J. So: None.

426,765,Identification of a genomic homozygous deletion of ZNF277 in a child with SLI,P06.48,,"Specific language impairment (SLI) is a common neurodevelopmental dis   order in which language abilities are below age expectations, in the absence  of explanatory environmental or medical conditions, such as hearing loss,  intellectual disability or autism. SLI affects 3 7% of English speaking pre  school children. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277   gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex   pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L   genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autistic spectrum dis   orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277  deletions. We observed  an increased frequency of ZNF277  deletions in probands with SLI (6/318,  1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen   dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277  in lymphoblastoid cell lines car  rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found  that, while ZNF277  microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do  not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi  crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 . Given these fin  dings, we postulate that ZNF277  microdeletions may contribute to the risk  of speech and language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risks previously described in this region.

427,843,Genomics of FXT AS (Fragile X associated Tremor Ataxia) mouse brains reveals hallmarks of altered neurodevelopmement and neurodegeneration.,P08.43,,"While FMR1 is silenced in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients carrying the full mutation, its expression is elevated (2 8 fold) in premutated individuals. The se subjects may develop the Fragile X associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and parkinsonism. In addition, people carrying the premutation can be affected by a set of neurological and behavioural disorders during young age. Memory problems have been detected in these patients as well as in the mouse mo del for FXTAS. In those animals, by transcriptome analysis we have shown a profound deregulation of the expression levels of genes involved in learning, memory and autistic behavior, Parkinson disease and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest the presence of a synapthopathy (Zongaro et al., HMG, 2013). Furthermore, we studied gene expression profiles of whole brain ob tained from both young and old FXTAS mice. We observed that in this context different neurodegenerative pathways are involved at different ages. In FXTAS mice, we also studied the expression level of several microRNAs that target FMR1 mRNA and we observed that one them, miR 221, is down regulated  at the synapse of young FXTAS mice and in the full brain of the older ones.  Interestingly, many of those deregulated mRNAs at the synapse, as well as in whole brain, are target of miR 221. These findings suggest a network regula  tion   including miRNAs and mRNAs  for FMR1 mRNA.  S. Zongaro: None. R. Hukema: None. R. Willemsen: None. B. Mari: None. B.  Bardoni: None.",2013,,"S.

The use of array CGH substantially improves the diagnosis of chromosomal  abnormalities that are not evident by conventional karyotype. Recently in an extended family with global developmental delay and autistic features,  a novel Xq12 q13.3 duplication was identified which contained amongst  others TAF1, GJB1 genes .(Kaya et al.2012).The GJB1 gene is associated with  morphology of myelin sheath and peripheral neuropathy, while TAF1  has  been linked with torsion dystonia  3. We present the clinical and molecular findings in two unrelated patients  with Xq13.1 duplication. The first one is a 5 year old boy with truncal hy   potonia, low deep tendon reflexes and proximal weakness. The other pati   ent is a 16 year old boy with progressive difficulties in walking, tremor and  learning disorder, while his mother has an identical positive family history in three deceased males. High resolution 4X180K Agilent arrays used in the  study (> 236.000 probes, average resolution of 8.9 Kb) revealed a duplicati   on on Xq13.1 (0.423 Mb) containing the TAF1 and GJB1 genes in both pati   ents, while the second patient had an additional deletion on 17q21.31 (0.63  Mb) containing KANSL1  gene.

Recently, two studies using individuals with common psychiatric disorders, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or schizophrenia, have shown a strong link bet   ween the fathersâ age at time of conception and identified DNM hotspots across the genome1,2. Though they were both revealing, these studies were conducted on cohorts of patients with psychiatric disorders known to result in part from DNM. Using disease free familial quartets we show for the first time that the overall ratio of somatic:germline DNM is 1:9 and that there is a positive correlation between paternal age and germline DNM in healthy subjects. Interestingly somatic and all CNV DNM did not vary with paternal age. We also found that DNM were not evenly distributed across the genome, which adds support to the possibility of DNM hotspots.

431,1526,Rare Variant Extensions of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test Detects Associations with Autism Exome Sequence Data,P16.106,,"Many population based rare variant association tests have been developed to analyze sequence data. A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise   quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa   tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7  gene. Given  the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

433,1691,"Offering pregnant couples at increased risk for Down syndrome a choice between 5 10 Mb and 0,5 Mb array analysis: a first impression of what pregnant couples really want",P19.70,,"Whole genome SNP array testing with a resolution of 0.5Mb is now availab   le in our university hospital for patients with increased risk for aneuploidy  and normal ultrasound examination results, referred mainly due to advan  ced maternal age or abnormal first trimester screening results. Thanks to higher testing resolution array technique reveals not only pathogenic ab   normalities, but also so called risk factors or susceptibility loci for intellec tual disability/developmental delay/autism spectrum disorders or epilepsy. Thus, more information about the (future) health of the unborn child can be obtained with this technique. We offered pregnant couples the choice bet   ween array results obtained by analysis at a 0,5 Mb or a 5 Mb resolution, the latter similar to that of karyotyping. The preliminary results of our pilot (n,30) are that 18% chose the 5 Mb resolution, 33% opted for 0.5 Mb reso   lution excluding risk factors and 47% opted for 0.5 Mb resolution including risk factors. Refusal to learn about risk factors was out of fear of becoming needlessly worried. Over 74% of couples indicated the wish to decide how  much information they desired about the (future) health of their unborn  child.So far, our results indicate that pregnant couples differed regarding their preferences. In addition all couples appreciated being offered the choice. It  seems that with the broadening of techniques for prenatal diagnosis, repro  ductive autonomy may only be accomplished by offering pregnant couples a choice regarding what they wish to learn about the (future) health of their unborn child.

439,1855,2q13.3 deletion syndrome in a newborn with ring chromosome 22 presenting with congenital hypotonia,J02.472,,"The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome or Phelan McDermid syndrome is characte rized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, absent to severely delayed speech, normal to accelerated growth with minor dismorphic fea tures such as dolichocephaly, large or unusual ears, long eye lashes, bulbous  nose, pointed chin, large hands and dysplastic toe nails. Most individuals  have moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic like beha viour and decreased pain perception. Frequency of the syndrome is equal in males and females while incidence is still unknown. Beside the simple de   letion, loss of 22q13.3 can also result from translocation, ring chromosome formation and other less common structural changes affecting the region containing SHANK3 gene on long arm of chromosome 22. The most features  of the syndrome thought to be the consequence of loss that specific gene. We present a case of female newborn with Phelan McDermid syndrome. The child was born on term, from first, uncomplicated pregnancy with un  remarkable family history. She was initially treated in NICU because of early  neonatal infection. Because of congenital hypotonia with mild facial dysmor   phic features genetic analysis were performed. The karyotype revealed ring  chromosome (22): 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13.3). A fluorescent in situ hybridisa   tion analysis was performed, indicating that the deletion encompassed the  critical 22q13.3 region. After good clinical evaluation, congenital hypotonia especially with dysmorphic features may be the only indication for genetic  evaluation, so we suggest importance of genetic review in cases like this.

445,1960,Role of medical rehabilitation program in chromosome 2 deletion with hypotonia case study,J07.21,,"Many genetic conditions are related to changes in different genes on chro  mosome 2. Recent studies suggest that genes on chromosome 2 may be in volved in intelligence determination. Partial deletion or loss of genes from specific regions of chromosome 2 is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder, which may be associated with syn dromes. In this paper we report the case of a young girl, admitted in our hos   pital for severe retardation in motor acquisitions, at 1 year just active rol ling, with severe hypotonia, specific symptoms and signs related to autism, severe mental retardation, microcephaly and mild facial dysmorphism, who was found to have a rare genetic condition represented by a small deletion of the long arms of chromosome 2. We included her in a complex rehabilita   tion program from the age of fourteen months. The objective was obtaining age appropriate functional independence. At the first admission she had a severe hypotonic syndrome, severe retardation in the acquisition of motor skills and mental retardation. After 7 hospitalizations of 21 days each, du ring 2 years, with complex rehabilitation programs pool with thermal water and hydrokinetotherapy, individual kinetotherapy, electrotherapy, general massage, occupational therapy, the evolution was favorable with motor im provement. Independent standing, alternating steps, wider support base, ability to rise after falling and walking on short distances were achieved.Rehabilitation treatment is effective in improving motor skills and must be an early intervention.

To succeed, we have proposed an original bioinformatic strategy of CNV/gene prioritization by rating data acquired from clinical, cytogenetic and genomic variation da tabases and by means of bioinformatic tools for genome, epigenome and pathway analysis. To test the strategy, we have evaluated the Russian co hort of children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and congeni tal anomalies (116 individuals; partially described in Iourov I.Y. et al. Mol. Cytogenet. 2012; 5:46.).

We previously showed that increased dosage of methyl CpG binding prote  in 2 (MeCP2) leads to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder in males, desi   gnated as the MECP2 duplication syndrome (MIM#300260). The increased  dosage of MeCP2 is the result of a copy number gain at Xq28, including the MECP2 gene and results in severe to profound neurodevelopmental delay  with onset at birth, limited or absent speech, hypotonia, epilepsy, autistic  behavior and motor dysfunction. We developed induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome carrying different  duplication sizes, to study the impact of increased MePC2 dosage in human  neurons. Differentiation of these iPSCs into neurons of cortical identity sho   wed modulation in the expression of progenitor genes like BLBP and FOXG1  and cortical genes like RELN, CTIP2, TBR1  and VGLUT. Cortical neurons  derived from Mecp2dup iPSCs had more synapses, and altered network  synchronization as well as dendritic complexity. Next, we tested a series of epigenetic drugs for the ability to rescue neuronal defects and validated two HDAC inhibitors as potential clinical candidates. Our model recapitulates  early stages of the human MECP2 duplication syndrome and represents a  promising cellular tool to facilitate therapeutic drug screening for severe  neurodevelopmental disorders .",2014,,"S.

453,134, Functional analysis of SHANK2 mutations identified in schizophrenia patients,C09.1,,"Genetic variants in the SHANK2  gene have been previously reported in pati   ents with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Our study fo  cused on the analysis of SHANK2  variants associated with schizophrenia. We  analyzed all exons and exon intron boundaries of the ProSAP1A_AB208026 isoform of SHANK2  by Sanger sequencing in a cohort of 481 schizophrenia  patients (177 trios and 304 singleton patients) and 374 unaffected indivi duals. We detected ten missense variants that affect protein structure which are only present in the patient group.We used mutation prediction tools that are based on evolutionary protein conservation and chemical properties of amino acids to select the four most promising variants. In silico investigation is helpful to estimate a functional  relevance of mutations, but cannot substitute the functional analysis itself. To analyze the functional impact of the four selected mutations, we conduc ted overexpression and knockdown rescue experiments in primary hippo campal neurons from rat with a major focus on morphological changes of the neurons. Another major point of our study was to investigate the effect of different SHANK2 isoforms and schizophrenia mutations on the actin  structures. We used COS 7 cells as a model system and live cell TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy for imaging of actin structu res. Additionally, we also performed actin polymerization assays to measu re in vivo F actin/G actin ratio in our mutants compared to SHANK2 wild  type.

455,192, Efficient molecular diagnosis of Intellectual Disability: targeted High throughput exon sequencing of 217 ID genes detects causative mutations in at least 26 of 106 tested patients,C18.2,,"Intellectual disability is a major public health problem, characterized by an extreme genetic heterogeneity, with several hundred genes implicated in monogenic forms with or without autism, complicating molecular dia gnosis. In patients without evocative syndromic forms the offer is limited to Fragile X testing and array CGH, leaving most cases undiagnosed. Trio Exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, but re mains costly for general implementation. We thus tested targeted exon se   quencing of 217 genes previously implicated in X linked ID, or in autosomal dominant or recessive forms in which ID is the major clinical concern. We analyzed 106 patients (mostly males and sporadic cases) with molecularly undiagnosed ID. One third of them harbored autistic features.We identified causative mutations in 26 patients: sixteen in X linked ge nes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD , FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1 , IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA,  MECP2, SLC9A6 , SLC16A2, PHF8), 10 de novo in autosomal genes (DYRK1A ,  GRIN1 , MED13L , TCF4, RAI1 , SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 ). We detected likely  causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3  for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge  nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit  more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions.  The identification of mutations in 25 29% of patients proves the diagnostic efficiency of this strategy, higher than CGH and comparable to trio exome sequencing at lesser cost.

460,685, S Intellectual disability and autistic behavior due to de novo microduplication of Xq28 involving part of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. Is this a plausible explanation?,P08.09,,", Bari, Italy,  4Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ  di Milano, Bari, Italy,  5Servizio di Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore,, Roma, Italy, 6Istituto  di Genetica Medica, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Saro Cuore, Roma, Italy, 7Istituto di  Anatomia Umana e Biologia Cellulare, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy. FRAXE is an X linked form of intellectual disability characterized by mild  to moderate cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic  behavior. The folate sensitive fragile site FRAXE is located in Xq28 appro  ximately 600 kb distal to the fragile X syndrome fragile site (FRAXA) and harbors an unstable GCC triplet repeat adjacent to a CpG island in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR  (untranslated region) of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. The disorder results from  amplification and methylation of the GCC repeats and consequence silen cing of AFF2. Although chromosome abnormalities (mostly deletions) that disrupt AFF2 have been reported with mild moderate intellectual disability,  microduplication of Xq28 that partially involved AFF2 has not been descri   bed as a potential cause of FRAXE. We performed clinical and molecular cha  racterization of patient with 301 kb interstitial de novo duplication at Xq28 (chrX:147ÃÂ490ÃÂ437 147ÃÂ791ÃÂ737bp)(GRCh37/hg19). This genomic mutati   on leads to the duplication of part of 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR region of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene which could be inactivated due to this genomic change. Namely, duplication of this segment potentially could have the same effects as amplification and  methylation of an unstable GCC triplet repeats. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are perfor   ming experiments aimed to study genic expression/metilation. As our pati   ent had cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity and mild dysmor   phism, we predict that partial duplication of AFF2 in our patient could be  the cause of his phenotype.",2014,,"N.

We identified CNVs with a high score of pathogenicity in 415 (27%) pati   ents. Among them 143 (34.4%) showed a CNV overlapping with a known syndrome, 272 (65.6%) a likely pathogenic rearrangement. Of particular interest, we found some CNVs useful to further delineate the clinical fea tures associated with deletions in 8q12.1q12.3, in 15q25.2, in 17q21.31, in 2q24.1q24.2, in 22q11.2, and duplications in 16p13.3 and in 11p13. Some CNVs were useful to describe new syndromes such as a 1.7 Mb deletion in 3q13.2q13.31. Also, we have identified a large group of small CNVs (< 1.0 Mb) encompassing, either in whole or in part, functionally related genes to the phenotypes such as CASK, CNTN6, SNTG2, HIP1, DLG2, NRXN1, MCPH1  and CHL1 genes.

Currently over 90 XLID genes have been found to be implicated in XLID. The host cell factor C1 (HCFC1) gene is located on chro mosome Xq28 and is a member of the host cell factor family. A mutation in HCFC1 has been previously found to be associated with XLID in a non syndromic XLID family namely MRX3. Currently very few studies exist that further confirm HCFC1 as an XLID gene.We present an XLID family with two affected sons having mild intellectual disability epilepsy and no congenital abnormalities. Fragile X analysis and array CGH using a chromosome X exon specific array were performed and revealed normal results. Subsequently, next generation whole exome se   quencing analysis for both brothers was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 following Agilent SureSelect sample preparation (20x coverage). Reads were aligned using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner and the Genome Analysis Tool Kit. Autosome variants and variants present in dbSNP 135 were filtered out. Analysis of rare X chromosome variants present in both brothers revealed a non synonymous mutation in exon 4 of HCFC1 (p.Ala897Val). This mutation is located within GABP2 and ZBTB17 binding domains.

Copy number variants are frequent in autism spectrum disorders and gene ralized epilepsy. In this study, we performed comparative genomic hybridi   zation assay (aCGH) using Agilent Microarray Kit, 4x180K in a preselected sample of 36 Bulgarian patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID). The region most often engaged in copy number changes included 15q11.2 15q12. In 7 patients (19.4%) CNVs were located in 15q12. Five of them har bored microduplications in GABRG3 gene, 1 patient showed microduplica tion in GABRB3 gene and in 1 patient both rearrangements were present. Aberrations in 15q11.2 region were observed in 2 patients. One of them was a 0.161 Mb deletion, including SNURF/SNRPN upstream reading frame. In the other patient, a 2.608 Mb duplication covering 36 genes was revealed. Genomic region on 15q11 13 is involved in many clinically important re arrangements. These include aberrations of various sizes which can affect the neuronal differentiation by disrupting normal epigenetic control and gene expression. All Bulgarian patients with CNVs harboring 15q12 shared a common clinical phenotype of severe ID, speech impairment or complete lack of speech, different types of seizures, facial dysmorphisms, microcepha ly and behavior abnormalities of the autistic spectrum. In contrast, the two patients with 15q11.2 rearrangements displayed different clinical characte ristics and milder forms of mental retardation. Our results are in line with the central role of GABAergic systems in ID and epilepsy.

The majority of patients had whole genome array CGH prior to the selection and we did not include large rearrangements such as MECP2 and FMR1 duplications. We identified 4 rearrangements considered as causative or potentially pathogenic, corresponding to a detection rate of 8%. Two CNVs affected known XLID genes and were therefore considered as causative (IL1RAPL1 and OPHN1 intragenic deletions). Two new CNVs were considered as potentially pathogenic as they affected interesting can didates for ID. The first CNV is a deletion of the first exon of the TRPC5 gene, encoding a cation channel implicated in dendrite growth and patterning, in a child presenting with ID and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The se   cond CNV is a partial deletion of KLHL15, in a patient suffering from severe ID, epilepsy and anomalies of cortical development.

470,733, M NPAS3 related copy number variants: a role in developmental delay?,P08.56,,"Neuronal PAS domain containing protein 3 (NPAS3) is a transcription factor expressed primarily in developing and adult brain tissues. Current evidence  suggests it is involved in neuronal development and maturation, and it has  recently been highlighted as potentially playing a key role in the evolution of the human brain. Clinically, NPAS3 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and numerous studies have supported this association. In addition, several cases of learning disabilities in patients with disruptions of this gene are reported, but this association remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present four unrelated individuals with small copy number vari ants (CNVs) within NPAS3: two intragenic duplications and two intragenic deletions. These CNVs range between 111 460kb in length and encompass  exonic sequences within the NPAS3 gene. All four patients had variable de   grees of developmental delay, and three had subtle distinctive facial features.  Two patients also had macrosomia and macrocephaly, while the other two had autistic features and behaviour issues, including psychosis in one indivi dual. In contrast, CNVs involving exonic sequences in NPAS3 have only been seen in one of over 19,000 controls. In summary, these four cases support an association between NPAS3 and developmental delay. This association is compatible with this geneÃ¢ÂÂs postulated effects on neuronal development, and suggests that abnormal function of NPAS3 may be implicated in other cases of non specific cognitive impairment.",2014,,"L.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU.

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autistic spectrum. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndromes in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval.Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan   ces. We selected a large and unique panel of WBS and 7dup ASD patients and derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the most advanced reprogramming technology based on synthetic mRNAs. These were then differentiated into relevant lineages to establish experimentally tractable models of these conditions.

KAT6B is highly conserved and expressed in adult neural stem cells. Most mutations are in exon 18 encoding the acidic (A) and tran scriptional activation (TA) domains of KAT6B. Genotype phenotype correla   tion showed that patients with mutations in the 5ÃÂ´ region of exon 18 leading to loss of both domains suffer from GPS, while patients with mutations in the 3ÃÂ´ region leading to loss of the TA domain suffer from SBBYSS.We present an 8 year old girl with intellectual disability, autism and multip   le developmental anomalies.

Birth measurements were normal, however, the baby was hypotonic and exhibited difficulties in feeding. At physical examination at the age of 2ÃÂ½ years measurements were still normal but we noted discrete dysmorphic features: long eye lashes, broad mouth with cupid bow lips, small fingers with broad short endphalanges, clinodactyly of toes V on both sides, tender translucent skin, fine hair and cryptorchidism on the right side. On the MRI at the age of 2 years delayed myelinisation was visible. As the atresia of the external auditory canal is typical for a deletion 18q we performed a karyotype on lymphocytes which was first reported with no pathological findings.The array (2.7 Affymetrix SNP oligo array platform) analysis revealed a de   letion in mosaic form of 20.7 Mb of the long arm of chromosome 18, encom passing 69 genes in total.

Microduplications in the PAR 1 region at Xp22.33 when found by SNP array analysis, poses a challenge to interpret.

Mutations in chromatin remodelling and histone modification genes are increasingly recognized as a major cause of intellectual disability (ID) and other frequently overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. BCL11A has recently been shown to be a stable subunit of the BAF SWI/SNF complex in mammals. This evolutionary conserved complex is involved in transcriptional regulation through ATP dependent modification of chroma tin structure.The Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study (DDD) has identified de novo mutations in BCL11A  (previously linked to autism spectrum disorder)  as a cause of non syndromic intellectual disability. We present the clinical features of these patients, as well as model organism studies that support the role of Bcl11a in neurodevelopmental phenotypes.In mouse embryonic development, Bcl11a is expressed in the forebrain  and derivatives of the first and second pharyngeal arches. It maintains high expression in the central nervous system and craniofacial mesenchyme throughout postnatal stages. The study of the haploinsufficient mouse mo del of Bcl11a shows abnormal brain development, with overall decreased  brain size, particularly in regions of the limbic system.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post transcriptional regulators and are involved in multiple aspects of brain development and connectivity. Here, using olfactory mucosal stem cells biopsied from living patients, we identified a signature of four miRNAs (miR 146a, miR 221, miR 654 5p and miR 656) commonly deregulated in ASD. This signature is conserved in pri mary skin fibroblasts and allows discriminating between ASD and intellec tual disability samples. Putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for pathways previously associated to ASD and alte red levels of neuronal transcripts targeted by miR 146a, miR 221 and miR 656 were observed in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ cells. In the mouse brain, miR 146a displays strong neuronal expression in regions important for high cognitive func tions, and we demonstrate that overexpressing miR 146a leads to alteration of neuronal dendritic arborisation.

531,204, ST AG1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for a new cohesinopathy with intellectual disability and characteristic facial features in four unrelated individuals,C21.2,,"Cohesinopathies are rare disorders arising from a dysfunction in the cohesin  pathway, which enables chromosome segregation and proper cell division.  So far, seven genes from this pathway have been reported in human disease.  Five of them are involved in autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X linked (SMC1A and HDAC8) Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and two of them  in autosomal recessive Roberts (ESCO2) and Warsaw Breakage syndromes  (DDX11). All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which,  along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3  males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel  lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency. Three had history of intrauterine growth retardation, two with prenatal onset  microcephaly, one with post natal growth retardation. One individual had  epilepsy, two had autistic features. The four patients shared common facial features, with widely spaced incisors, thin eyebrows, and high nasal bridge. The mechanism for haploinsufficiency was a small deletion encompassing  STAG1 diagnosed by array CGH in two individuals, an intragenic deletion in  STAG1 found by whole genome analysis in one individual, and a missense heterozygous mutation (c.641A>G) revealed by exome analysis in the last patient.

541,687, De novo 19p13.2 microdeletion encompassing the part of NFIX gene in a girl with Sotos like phenotype,PM08.02,,"19p13.2 microdeletion is a rare genomic disorder. To date, less than ten cases was described so far in the literature. This chromosomal syndrome manifests in developmental delay/intellectual impairment, postnatal over   growth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphy, slender habitus, advanced bone age, and scoliosis. Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent. Very similar phenotype is observed in the Sotos syndrome 2 (MIM #614753) that is caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions of the NFIX gene located on chromosome 19p13.2.Here, we report on the case of a 7 year old girl referred to genetic counse   ling because of psychomotor retardation, speech delay and dysmorphic fea tures (macrocephaly, long/narrow and triangular face, high forehead, fron tal bossing, downslanting palpebral fissures, dysplastic low set ears, small nose, flat philtrum, micrognathia). At the examination, behavioral problems (anxiety, tantrums, autoaggression), seizures, and poor coordination were noted. Skeletal anomalies (advanced bone age, joint laxity, slender hands with long fingers, abnormal setting of the lower limbs), strabismus, hypero pia as well as constipations and abdominal pain were also diagnosed.Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a de novo 158.18 kb (the smallest so far) deletion of 19p13.2 region (chr19:13,020,206 13,178,390; hg19) encompassing seven genes; three of them (NFIX, DAND5 and CALR) could be the candidate genes for the genotype phenotype rela   tionship.This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13.2 microdeletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region.

A submicroscopic duplication in the Xp22.31 region was identified in 8 patients (5Ã¢ÂÂ:3Ã¢ÂÂ) ranging in size from 257 Kb to 1.7 Mb. In all individuals studied (four out of eight) the Xp22.31 duplication was inherited from the mother. The HDHD1, STS, VCX and PNPLA4 genes are included in four cases with a 1.6Mb duplication, who show autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and no dysmorphic features. Interestingly, two cases with a size below 580Kb, where only HDHD1 and STS genes are duplicated, show a more severe phenotype with multiple malformations. The largest duplica   tion detected (from VCX3A to VCX2) is associated with language delay. The patient also carries a deletion at 6p23 of 1.3 Mb as a result of an unbalanced t(6;9). Finally, a duplication of 565Kb involving VCX and PNPLA4 was detec ted in a boy with psychomotor delay.Conclusion:We have detected an association of the Xp22.31 duplication with ID and ASD in both genders. According to the literature, there is a high variability in the Xp22.31 duplication associated phenotype, which may be due to incomplete penetrance, the different genes involved, a position effect and X inactivation.

545,708, A novel HCN1 mutation not associated with epileptic encephalopathy,PS08.23,,"B. Rossi Hospital, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita  bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy   perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety  of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity.  Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as  sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi  leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with  different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits. Here we report the case of a 9 year old girl with a Rett like phenotype, cha  racterized by intellectual disability, hand stereotypies, absent speech, nega tive brain MRI and EEG data and no history of epilepsy. By NGS approach,  with the use of a targeted intellectual disability/epilepsy gene panel, we  found the girl to carry a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the HCN1 gene. This mutation is located in the glycine tyrosine glycine (GYG) motif, which constitutes the ion selectivity filter typical of K+  permeable channels. This motif is highly conserved structurally and functio  nally during evolution.This is the first report of a HCN1 mutation involved in a neurodevelopmen  tal phenotype without epilepsy.",2015,,"E.

546,710, Chromosome 1q21.1 recurrent imbalances in patients with developmental delay revealed by Array CGH,PS08.25,,"Chromosome region 1q21.1 is structurally very complex formed by several segmental duplications that make it prone to non allelic homologous re  combination (NAHR). It can be divided into a proximal region containing  16 genes and a distal region containing 13 genes. Array Comparative Ge nomic Hybridization (array CGH) has led to the identification of new syn  dromes including microdeletion 1q21.1 and 1q21.1 microduplication. Cli  nical features of patients include intellectual disability (ID) and dysmorphic features. Clinical variability and lack of distinct facial dysmorphisms have been reported in individuals affected by these imbalances, making genetic  counseling very challenging. Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis using an Agilent 180K platform was per formed in 1200 patients with ID, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and con  genital anomalies. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis usingc  SureFISH probes was performed in patients for validation and in parents to determine the origin of 1q21.1 rearrangements. We identified 8 probands with imbalances involving the distal 1q21.1 region  (6 deletions and 2 duplications) and 1 proband with a duplication invol ving the proximal region.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects.We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con   tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase.This innovative strategy to collect information on natural history and co morbidities of rare monogenic forms of ID/autism will promote familiesÃ¢ÂÂ empowerment and hopefully impact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ care.

Copy number variations (CNV) in RBFOX1, also known as A2BP1, have been associated with human neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disease.This gene, spanning 1.7 MB on chromosome 16p13.3, is one of the largest genes in the human genome, responsible for encoding splicing regulatory factors, specifically expressed in neurons and muscles, and having a regula  tory action in alternative splicing of a large tissue specific gene networks. Materials and methods: Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, using an Agi  lent 4x180K platform, was performed in 1200 patients with mental retarda tion, autism spectrum disorders and congenital anomalies. Results: In our cohort, we identified 6 cases with intragenic deletions in RB  FOX1, 4 of them with additional CNV in other chromosomes. These CNVs are located at 16p13.3, extended in a 1,2Mb region between 6,087,983 7   ,207,012 (GRCh37/hg19), which corresponds to intronic regions in 5 out of  6 patients. Five of these patients have an inherited deletion, from an unaffec  ted progenitor, and one has an unknown inheritance pattern.Conclusions: The phenotypes of all these children have in common, as wide  ly described, neurological alterations.

The 15 year old boy is the first and only child of healthy, non consanguineous  German parents, born at term after a pregnancy complicated by uterus myomatosus and gestosis. Birth measurements were normal but green am niotic fluid was noted. The boy walked independently with 2 ÃÂ½ years and never learned to speak and he is not toilet trained. Seizures started with 4 years of age and could be treated effectively. Agitated behavior and autistic features needed medication. Brain MRI revealed reduced temporal gyri on the left. The patient attends a special school and behaves like a toddler. Body measurements were normal throughout life, but head circumference was above the 97th centile. The patient has a high and broad forehead, promi nent lips and small hands and feet.Trio exome sequencing revealed a maternally inherited frame shift muta   tion (c.841delC, p.(Gly281Ser fs*33)) and a paternally inherited missense  mutation in SZT2  gene (c.9787G>A, p.(Asp3263Asn)).

557,774, Expression profile of circulating miRNAs in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),PS09.017,,"Introduction: ASD is a genetically complex disorder, highly heterogeneous and with unclear etiology. In this study we addressed the possible contri bution of epigenetic factors to ASD etiology, focusing on deregulated Mi croRNAs (miRNAs) expression. miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. miRNAs are thought to be released from pathological tissues to plasma in illness situations, and the strong correlation between circulating and tissue miRNAs indicates that plasma miRNAs may be useful disease biomarkers.Methods: miRNA plasma profiles were obtained for patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), essentially disruptive beha vior, language delay and psychomotor delay. Patients were all male, with a mean developmental coefficient of 92ÃÂ±18, and no obvious dysmorphisms. Exiqon human miRNome PCR panels (testing 752 miRNAs) were used for miRNA profiling.Results: We identified 50 miRNAs differentially expressed in ASD vs NDD. Notably, of the 10 miRNAs with higher fold change (increased 2.5 3.3X), 8 miRNAs had a target gene in common, MMP16. This gene is expressed at high levels in the brain, and a balanced de novo translocation in a ASD pati   ent involving MMP16 has previously been described.Conclusions: This is the first study of circulating miRNA profiles comparing patients with ASD and other NDDs. The preliminary results suggest that miRNA profilling may eventually improve differential diagnosis. The results also implicate novel pathological pathways in ASD, namely involving metal   oproteinases.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental condi   tion with highly complex genetic predisposition. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of both sequence and structural rare variations in ASD susceptibility. In particular, focusing on rare copy number variants (CNVs) has already been highly productive in uncovering an increasing num ber of specific genes and chromosomal intervals conferring risk to ASD.During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach on 9 multiplex ASD families from Sardinia, we identified a rare genic deletion of ~37 Kb, transmitted from the unaffected mother to both affected siblings. This deletion includes the entire CAPG gene and the last coding exons of  ELMOD3 . CAPG encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin re  gulatory proteins, that might be involved in control of dendritic spine shape. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, with recently proposed functional links to sound perception and actin cytoske leton.No deletions involving this genomic region were found in 4768 controls from published high resolution SNP array data, while other two deletions encompassing CAPG and ELMOD3 have been reported in two subjects with  ASD, suggesting that CAPG and/or ELMOD3 haploinsufficiency may have  clinical relevance to ASD.

We report on two brothers aged 8ys3m and 9ys6m, respectively meeting the DSM 5 clinical criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder. Both were assessed on the ADI R and the ADOS 2. Each child underwent a cogni tive assessment by the Wechsler Intelligence Scales, depending on the age. Both had a low average total IQ, and did not show congenital malformations or minor anomalies. An array CGH showed, in both, an interstitial deletion on the short arm of chromosome 20 (20p12.1), sizing 72 Kb, with paternal segregation. The deletion encompassed the MACROD2 gene. This was asso   ciated in the younger brother with an interstitial duplication on 16q21, si zing 366 Kb, with paternal segregation, encompassing the RPS15AP34  gene;  and, in the older one, with an interstitial deletion on 7p21.2, sizing 135 Kb, with maternal segregation, encompassing no genes.

It is characterized by moderate to severe in tellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, microcephaly, short stature, dysmorphic features, structural brain anomalies and multiple congenital or   gans defects. It is considered a contiguous gene syndrome involving deletion of several genes. Deletions previously reported are variable in size (from 203 kb to 6.9 Mb) and have non recurrent breakpoints. We report here three additional patients carried a 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion shown by SNP array analysis (Cyto12 SNP , Illumina) : a prenatal case and two postnatal cases. The prenatal and one of the postnatal cases share an overlapping 2p15p16.1 deletion of 105 kb including only XPO1 and the distal end of USP34. Both pa tients presented features overlapping the clinical spectrum of the 2p15p16 microdeletion syndrome including dysmorphic facial features and brain structural abnormalities. We confirm that one or both genes are probab   ly involved in facial dysmorphic features, cognitive impairment and brain structural abnormalities observed in 2p15p16.1 deletion syndrome.The third patient we reported on is a 4 years old male with an heterozygous de novo a 427 kb deletion at 2p16.1 (chr2:60624940 61051867) containing BCL11A and PAPOLG and a phenotype characterized by speech delay, auti   stic traits and stereotyped behavior but without microcephaly.Considering previous deletions in the 2p15p16.1 region and our three new cases, we precise the genotype phenotype correlation of the microdeletion syndrome.

However, rare cases with proximal, central and distal deletions in 22q11 region have been reported with different phenotypes.We report three cases with atypical deletions diagnosed in a total of 119 patients with deletions in 22q11.2 region attended in our 22q11DS Multi   disciplinary Clinics.The first case, a girl with short stature, hirsutism and ventricular septal defect was found to have a distal 22q11DS deletion, arr[hg19] 22q11.21(20754422 21561514)x1, including the CRKL gene and with no overlap with the known critical region. The deletion was also present in her brother that only pre sents nasal voice and her asymptomatic father. A paternal uncle died around 3 months old of congenital heart disease sixty years ago.The second and third cases are two boys that shared a de novo deletion in the centromeric end of the distal region of 22q11DS, arr[hg19] 22q11.21q11.22 (21505358/21808950 22905068)x1.

The origins of somatic genome variations manifesting as structural chro mosomal rearrangements remain largely unknown. However, it is generally  accepted that susceptibility to structural chromosome aberrations can be  produced by alterations to DNA sequences flanking the breakpoints or to rearranged chromosomal regions (i.e. CNV). Addressing genome variations  in children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital  malformations (n,200) by high resolution CNV analysis (molecular karyo typing; resolution: 1 kbp or higher), we have surprisingly found that somatic structural chromosome abnormalities can co occur with non mosaic ones  within the same loci. More precisely, we detected 8 cases (4%) (4 dupli  cations and 4 deletions) demonstrating small non mosaic structural chro mosome rearrangements encompassed by larger mosaic ones. The dupli  cations were mosaic dup3p26.3p26.1 (5.8 Mb) vs. regular dup3p26.1 (2.9  Mb); mosaic dup14q32.13q32.2 (4.5 Mb) vs. regular dup14q32.2 (1.8 Mb); mosaic dup17p13.1p11.2 (6.9 Mb) vs. regular dup17p12 (1.4 Mb); mosaic  dup18p11.32p11.31 (5.3 Mb) vs. regular dup18p11.32p11.31 (4.8 Mb). The  deletions were mosaic del5q35.1q35.3 (9.2 Mb) vs. regular del5q35.2q35.3 (2.3 Mb); mosaic del14q11.2 (2.2 Mb) vs. regular del14q11.2 (0.5 Mb); mo saic del15q13.1q14 (8.2 Mb) vs. regular del15q13.2q13.3 (2 Mb); mosaic  delXp22.32p22.2 (4.7 Mb) vs. regular delXp22.31 (0.7 Mb). These findings  allowed us to hypothesize small regular structural variations (CNV) to be able to produce locus specific constitutional chromosome instability resul  ting in larger somatic rearrangements.

581,1473, Genomic/epigenomic defects associated with surprisingly detected parental consanguinity uncovered by molecular karyotyping with SNP arrays,PS17.09,,"Parental consanguinity is generally accepted to be a risk factor for hereditary diseases. However, parents may not know about their consanguinity. As a re sult, clinical genetic evaluation is unable to provide a preliminary diagnosis for performing targeted molecular genetic diagnosis. Fortunately, there do exist whole genome scanning techniques making possible to detect not only genomic but also epigenomic variations (i.e. segmental loss of heterozygo sity or SLOH) for evaluating levels of consanguinity. Here, we have analyzed genomes of 188 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformations using SNP/oligonucleotide molecular karyoty   ping (Affymetrix) and an original bioinformatic technology for addressing phenotypic, cellular and molecular consequences of genomic/epigenomic variations. SLOH, specific to clinical manifestations in these children, were found in 6 cases (3.2%). It is to note that parental consanguinity was not initially reported in all these cases. In one child, Meier Gorlin syndrome was diagnosed. Other cases were also associated with hereditary diseases. Two cases of SLOH indirectly related to the phenotype were associated with mi crodeletions in 14q22.1 and 15q15.2, respectively. Parental consanguinity has long been considered as a source of knowledge about origins of here ditary diseases. In the present study, the possibility of genetic analyses of children born in consanguineous marriages has been extended by whole genome and bioinformatic analyses. Actually, it has been shown that sur prisingly detected consanguinity can be relatively common and molecular diagnosis using SNP arrays and bioinformatics can be useful for revealing of mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic diseases.

582,1507, The unique evolutionary signature of autism genes,PS18.07,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent heritable neurodevelopmen tal disorder, characterized by social, and communication disabilities that greatly reduce reproductive fitness. The maintenance of such heritable and low reproductive trait in the human population is an evolutionary enigma that likely left a signature in ASD genes. To test this hypothesis, we studied the allelic characteristics of 441 ASD genes and 15,144 non ASD genes in a whole exome sequencing dataset, which included data on 503,481 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 1351 European Americans, and 1088 African Americans individuals. We discovered that ASD genes were significantly lon ger, and less variable than non ASD genes (2684 vs. 1632 bp, and nucleoti   de diversity ÃÂ , 0.036 vs. ÃÂ , 0.046 respectively; P<0.001). The mutational dearth in ASD genes was particularly eminent when considering only SNVs with functional consequences, a possible effect of negative selection.

588,10,Mendel Lecture: Epigenetics and Rett syndrome,PL4.1,,"The word epigenetics excites great interest within biology and beyond, despite uncertainty about its definition. At one level it concerns the signi ficance of the plethora of chemical marks on chromosomes that modulate gene activity (collectively known as the Ã¢ÂÂepigenomeÃ¢ÂÂ). Prominent among these marks is DNA methylation   a modification that is directly applied to DNA and affects its interaction with proteins. Several clinical disorders invol ve genes that interpret or lay down the epigenome. For example, the autism spectrum disorders Rett syndrome and MECP2 duplication syndrome are caused by mutations in the gene for the protein MeCP2. The MeCP2 protein binds to sites on DNA that are chemically altered by DNA methylation and appears to interpret this Ã¢ÂÂepigeneticÃ¢ÂÂ mark to affect gene expression. Clues to the function of MeCP2 are provided by the spectrum of mutations causing Rett syndrome and the biochemical and genetic analyses. Recent evidence derived from animal and cellular models suggests that the primary function of this protein is to restrain transcription in a DNA methylation dependent manner. Interestingly, the resulting defects are reversible in model systems suggesting that the disorder may be curable. Current research addressing these aspects of MeCP2 biology will be presented.

591,141,A Complex Mutational Spectrum of Structural Variation Contributing to Autism,C15.1,,"Recent genomic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have relied upon genome wide characterization of coding mutations using whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variants (CNV) using chromosomal microarray (CMA). In ASD, these efforts have revealed a strong associati on with de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and CNVs segments that alter the dosage of genes under evolutionary constraint. Unfortunately, the impact of balanced and complex structural variation (SV), which also repre sent LoF variation, remains uncharacterized in ASD and other human disea   se studies. Here, we explored the full mutational spectrum of SV contribu ting to ASD by integrating large insert, short insert and synthetic long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies with CMA in 307 idiopathic ASD probands and 120 family members from the Simons Simplex Collec tion. Analyses revealed a diverse landscape of SVs beyond canonical CNVs, including inversions, insertions, and translocations. We also categorized 13 distinct subclasses of recurrent complex SVs and demonstrate that each ge nome sequenced harbored at least one such large complex rearrangement (~5 kb resolution). We identified 26 de novo SVs likely contributing to ASD, 50% of which were cryptic to detection by previous technologies on the se same samples. These data confirmed 13 previously proposed ASD risk factors and discovered 12 novel candidates. We estimate that the overall contribution of de novo SVs in ASD at this resolution to be at least 8.2%, or a two fold increase over previous analyses restricted to CNVs.

593,143, Disruption of POGZ is associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders,C15.3,,"Introduction: Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are genetically heterogeneous, and associated genes for both condi   tions overlap substantially. Few mutations in POGZ were reported in recent exome studies. However, these studies did not provide detailed clinical in formation, leaving the pathogenicity and a clear phenotypic definition of the POGZ patient unknown.Patients and Methods: We collected the clinical and molecular data of 25 individuals with disruptive mutations in POGZ identified by diagnostic who le exome, whole genome, or targeted sequencing of 5,223 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (ID primarily) or by targeted resequencing of this locus in 12,041 individuals with ASD and/or ID. In parallel, we utili   zed a Drosophila knockdown model of the POGZ orthologue row to provide further support for the importance of POGZ in cognitive function.Results: We defined common phenotypic features of POGZ patients, inclu   ding variable levels of developmental delay and more severe speech and language delay compared to motor delay and coordination issues. We also identified significant associations with vision problems, microcephaly, hy   peractivity, a tendency to obesity and feeding difficulties. In addition, we found that downregulation of row expression, specifically in neurons, leads to deficits in habituation, a form of non associative learning that is highly relevant for both ID and ASD. Conclusion: Combined, these data underscore the pathogenicity of loss of  function mutations in POGZ and define a novel POGZ related syndrome.

Brain MRIs re vealed subtle abnormalities, such as corpus callosum hypoplasia and ven triculomegaly. Intriguingly, in vivo functional knockdown of SIN3A using in utero electroporation led to changes in the developing mouse brain such as reduced cortical neurogenesis, altered neuronal identity and aberrant cortico cortical projections, observations that have a high translational va lue with the clinical features of our individuals. Together, our data establish that haploinsufficiency of SIN3A is associated with mild ID and associated characteristics as observed in the atypical 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, and that Sin3A is a key transcriptional regulator crucial for proper develop mental expansion and connectivity of cortical brain areas.This work was supported by funding from Science without Borders, CAPES Brasil (BEX 12044/13 0) to T .C.D.D, The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development, ZonMw (grant 907 00 365) to T .K., the Dutch Brain Foundation (HsN F2014(1) 16) to J.E.V. and the German Mini stry of Research and Education (grant numbers 01GS08164, 01GS08167, 01GS08163 German Mental Retardation Network) to H.E. and T .M.S.",2016,,"J.

Introduction. 2q37.3 deletion syndrome is considered to be a rare chro mosomal disorder associated with variable clinical features, among which are intellectual disability (ID), autistic features, brachydactyly, short stat   ure, hypotonia and obesity. Some facial features are characteristic for the syndrome (i.e. round face, frontal bossing, arched eyebrows, deep set eyes, upslanted palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, thin upper lip, minor ear anomalies). Haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 seems to be the most critical for the phenotypic spectrum. Here, we have attempted to assess chromosome ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  157Back to index 2q37.3 deletions and HDAC4 haploinsufficiency per se in children with in  tellectual disability, autism and/or congenital malformation. Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping by SNP/oligonucleotide mi  croarray (resolution: >1kbp) was used to analyze 300 children with ID, au   tism spectrum disorders and congenital malformations. Results. Cytogenetically visible 2q37 deletions were detected in 2 cases.  Molecular karyotyping confirmed the presence of these deletions (5Mb and 8.5Mb). Furthermore, a CNV within 2q37.3 (44kbp) leading to HDAC4 loss was detected in a patient. All affected female patients had ID, autism and  minor ear anomalies. One had widely set nipples and hypotonia. Another  one had a short statue. Two patients presented with ocular hypertelorism. HDAC4 haploinsufficiency was observed in all three cases. Conclusions. We show that 2q37 deletions can be common in children with  ID, autism, congenital malformations tending to a frequency as high as 1%. Therefore, one can suggest that 2q37.3 deletions are likely to be more com  mon among these children than previously recognized.

It is also well known that CNVs play important roles in microde   letion syndromes. Several methods were developed to detect CNVs. One of these methods, array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH), is now the recommended first tier test for molecular diagnosis in patients with cognitive disorders. aCGH detects genome wide CNVs, however, findings should be validated. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify CNVs detected by aCGH in patients with cognitive disorders,.Materials and methods: aCGH (AgilentÃÂ® 8x60K) analyses for 150 patients with cognitive disorders detected 19 CNVs   either of unknown clinical si gnificance or of likely pathogenicity. Afterwards, these CNVs were verified by SYBR Green based quantitative PCR (qPCR).Results: Verification was done in 18 CNVs. Of these, 4 CNVs turned out to be false positives. Two CNVs were de novo. Clinical correlation of the CNVs revealed that these 16 CNVs were among the already known microdeleti on and/or microduplication syndromes. In order to draw attention to the importance of verification, two patients will be presented: One with a con firmed and paternally inherited deletion at 2q37, and the other with a false positive duplication at 1q21.3.Conclusion: The current study has shown that CNVs detected by aCGH ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  158Back to index should always be verified, for example by qPCR, especially when there is an  impact on clinical phenotype.

609,664, Identification of de novo FOXP1 variants in three unrelated individuals,P08.28,,"Background and aims: FOXP1 is a member of the Forhead Box P (FOXP) sub family of transcription factors, which also includes FOXP2. Disruptions of FOXP2, the closest relative to FOXP1, have been involved in the etiology of familial verbal dyspraxia.In the last few years, 11 individuals with FOXP1 variants have been repor   ted, supporting the implication of this gene in the pathogenesis of human cognitive disorders including language impairment. These patients show autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, global developmental de   lay and moderate to severe speech delay.We report on three new individuals with de novo FOXP1 variants showing features that are consistent with this new clinical entity (MIM 613670).Method: Whole genome aCGH was carried out in patients 1 and 2 using a custom designed 60K oligonucleotide array (KaryoArrayÃÂ®v3.0).Whole exome sequencing was performed as a trio in patient 3 to identify de novo mutations related to the phenotype after a normal result using aCGH.Results: Patient 1 had a 379 Kb de novo deletion that only affected FOXP1.

614,701," Effect of intranasal insulin on development in Phelan McDermid syndrome: a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial",P08.69,,"Introduction: Phelan McDermid (PMS) or 22q13.3 deletion syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Clinical features include moderate to severe intellectual disability and behavioural problems in the autism spec trum. Other researchers had observed a beneficial effect of intranasal insu lin on development and behaviour in a pilot study in six children with PMS. To validate this effect, we conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial using a stepped wedge design.Material and methods: Twentyfive children aged 1 to 16 years with a 22q13.3 deletion including the SHANK3 gene participated in the clinical trial for a period of 18 months. Starting 6 months before the trial, children were sy   stematically assessed for development and behaviour every 6 months. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th assessments were followed by daily nose sprays containing either insulin or placebo for a 6 month period. A 5th assessment was done directly after the end of the trial.Results: Intranasal insulin did not cause serious adverse events. It increased the level of developmental functioning by 0.4 1.4 months per 6 month pe riod that, while not statistically significant in this small group, was conside   red clinically relevant. A stronger, significant effect was observed in children older than 3 years, who usually show a decrease of developmental growth.Conclusions: Although the application of intranasal insulin is a promising therapeutic approach, clinical trials in larger study populations are required to prove the therapeutic effect of intranasal insulin in PMS.Grant: Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development 113 20 2009Contact: 22q13@umcg.nl",2016,,"R.

615,704, Characterization of patient with de novo frameshift PUF60 mutation suggests that disruption of this gene is sufficient for most symptoms of Verheij syndrome,P08.72,,"Verheij syndrome (OMIM 615583) is associated with rare de novo 8q24.3  microdeletions. Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce   phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial   ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60  and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense  PUF60  mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked  coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60  and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced  different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome.We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty   ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four  nucleotides in PUF60  (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p.I136Tfs*31). The  patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome. The  case illustrates the strength of exome sequencing in deciphering the genetic basis of diseases.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.",2016,,"M.

616,705,First case of concurrent RAI1 mutation and ANKRD11 partial deletion in a girl with features of Smith Magenis and KBG syndromes,P08.73,,"Smith Magenis (SMS) and KBG syndromes are rare autosomal dominant dis   orders characterized by distinctive facial features and intellectual disability  (ID), caused by RAI1 and ANKRD11 haploinsufficiency, respectively. Here we describe a 46,XX girl aged 8 years, who shows mild to moderate facial dysmorphisms, ID, and an autism spectrum disorder. Upon exclusion  of 17p11.2 SMS locus deletion by previous genetic investigation, RAI1 muta   tional screening identified an unreported heterozygous missense mutation  (p.G1036R) inherited from the healthy father who shares with his daugh ter the facial aspect only. MLPA and RT qPCR analyses on RAI1 revealed a  wild type condition, whereas high resolution array CGH analysis disclosed  a rare de novo deletion at 16q24.3, never reported in healthy subjects. The deletion affects the last two exons and the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of ANKRD11. RT qPCR per  formed on the KBG gene revealed the simultaneous existence of wild type  and truncated mRNA, each present at 50% of the total amount detected in healthy controls.Based on these findings and considering that ANKRD11 mutations have been  reported in a few clinically borderline Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) patients, a  clinical revaluation of the proband was performed. Neither microcephaly and developmental delay, generally associated to CdLS, nor macrodontia  and short stature, hallmarks of the classic KBG phenotype, were observed.  However, the proband shows a composite phenotype mixing up KBG and  SMS signs. This peculiar clinical picture might result from the combined ef fect of RAI1 mutation and ANKRD11 de novo deletion, which does not likely imply gene haploinsufficiency, as in classical SMS and KBG syndromes.",2016,,"I.

617,706, Copy number variation in RBFOX1 and DOCK8: Neurodevelopmental disorders or benign variants?,P08.74,,"Deletions and duplications involving the genes RBFOX1 and DOCK8 have been implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disor   ders (ASD). However, the clinical significance of these CNVs is controversial. We analysed 14 RBFOX1 deletions (20 309 kb), six RBFOX1 duplications (34 kb to 1.34 Mb), and eight DOCK8 deletions (22 227 kb) from unrelated individuals. Our analysis revealed that five DOCK8 deletions were terminal and three were interstitial. Two deletions lie within intron 1, two include only exon 1, and four include multiple exons. Thirteen of the RBFOX1 de   letions lie within a single intron; deletion of intron 3 and intron 4 are the most common. Though the clinical information provided is limited, seven individuals with RBFOX1 deletions have a diagnosis of ASD. The clinical si gnificance of duplications is difficult to interpret since intragenic gains can lead to loss of function, whereas whole gene duplication can lead to triplo sensitivity. Half of the RBFOX1 duplications have one breakpoint upstream of the gene and one breakpoint in intron 2, which is predicted to maintain the reading frame if the duplications are in direct tandem orientation. One RBFOX1 duplication lies entirely within intron 3 and two include only exon 4, which could lead to an out of frame transcript. Our analysis sheds light on the genomic structures of small CNVs implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Only two CNVs had identical breakpoints, suggesting diversity in RBFOX1 and DOCK8 rearrangements rather than a few common variants. However, the clinical significance of these CNV remains unclear since all CNVs we included were inherited.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  173Back to index",2016,,"S.

The  third is a 3 bases deletion variant NM_001080420.1:c.5090_5092delACC (p.(His1697del)) involving the exon 22 in the SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) do   main involved in multimerization of SHANK3 protein. Conclusion: The retrospective clinical examination of these patients did not  permit to distinct specific signs, which highlights the phenotypic hetero  geneity of these patients.

Methods: We used an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from a healthy male subject to perform dual guide CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of 9 independent genes for which LoF mutations represent strong risk factors  for ASD. The efficiency of 30 dual guide RNA combinations to generate dele  tions was then compared, using either FACS sorting or puromycin selection followed by serial dilutions to obtain single cell derived colonies. Results: Dual guide CRISPR successfully generated deletions in all genes,  however the efficiency varied widely by guide RNA and cellular protocol. The overall efficiency of the FACS method was 3.4% to generate predicted  ablations, out of 1002 colonies screened (range , 0%   10.6%). By contrast,  the puromycin method had an average efficiency of 15.1% from 4437 colo nies (range ,0%   32%).Conclusions: This systematic survey of genome editing approaches suggests that dual guide deletion generation varies widely by guide pair. We also find that the increased certainty of deriving a single cell from FACS sorting comes at a significant cost in terms of efficiency and cell viability compared to se   rial dilutions.Support: Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (SFRH/BD/52049/2012), Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, Autism Speak",2016,,"C.

Six runs of BOLD fMRI data were collected to assess the networks of the visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval; a single run of encoding task was followed by 10 minute retention period, then 2 runs of the retrieval tasks both for visual and verbal domain respectively. During encoding participants were instructed to memorize the task stimu li, whilst during retrieval they were instructed to decide whether the given image or word was presented during the encoding period. Data analysis was performed using the SPM8 toolbox under Matlab, with standard processing steps.Results: In patient fMRI for visual memory encoding/retrieval showed hig her activation in the posterior insulae, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared to the controls where visual areas were predominant in these tasks. Verbal memory activation was higher in the hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, precuneus; and lower in the anterior insulae; higher visual areas in our patient compared to the controls.Conclusion: The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication resulted in peculiar activity pat   tern of the brain responsible for visual and verbal memory in ASD.

Its genetic underpinnings are very heteroge neous and include many common and rare variants located in hundreds of different loci, each characterized by variable levels of penetrance. Multiplex families from single ethnic groups represent a useful means to reduce hete rogeneity and enhance genetic load. We screened 19 Italian ASD multiplex families (3 triplets and 16 duplets, total N,41 ASD subjects), using array CGH (Agilent 180K). Certainly or probably causal CNVs, defined Ã¢ÂÂclinical   ly relevant CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ, were detected in 17/41 (41%) of ASD probands, corre sponding to 9/19 (47%) multiplex families with at least one affected sibling genetically positive. However only in 3/9 (33%) of these families, siblings share the same causal or highly causal CNV.

We report a 68 year old female with mild moderate intellectual disability, behavioral findings suggesting ASD, developmental delay and dysmorphic features. The SNP array analysis demonstrated a 257 kb deletion comprising exon 6 of AUTS2 gene.Case Report: The patient was born at term as the first child of an unrela   ted couple following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Mild motor and significant speech delay were evident during childhood. On her physical examination at age 68, she had short stature, microcephaly and abdominal obesity. Mild facial findings and micrognathia were noted. She was followed for scoliosis since early adulthood. Orthopedic findings were present. Her intellectual disability was mild to moderate with behavioral problems. She was noted to be a very friendly, active and girly person. She had limited eye contact, hyperverbality with limited vocabulary of 40 50 words. She had tics and obsessions, skin pricking, hyperorality and sound sensitivity. She was not schooled but her family made sure that she was involved in daily activities.Conclusions: This clinical report provides the natural history in the eldest patients yet to be reported and complements the existing evidence sugge sting that disruption of the AUTS2 gene leads to a recently delineated neu rodevelopmental phenotype with a wide spectrum, namely Ã¢ÂÂ AUTS2 Syndro meÃ¢ÂÂ.",2016,,"E.

633,765, Autism related gene expression is spatially restricted in mid gestation human fetal cerebellum,P09.042,,"Introduction: Cerebellar dysfunction has a large impact on both cognitive and motor behavior and mounting evidence implicates the cerebellum in  autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the impact of ASD genes on ce  rebellar development and function is largely unknown. Here, we defined the 15 post conception week (pcw) human fetal cerebellar transcriptome and  hypothesized that ASD genes have neuron type specific expression. Materials and Methods: Laser capture microdissection (LCM) of intact cerebella from two 15 pcw fetuses enabled isolation of Purkinje cell (PC) and granule cell (GC) progenitor neurons. High quality RNA was isolated  (RIN>8), sequencing libraries using TruSeq RNA Access kit were construc  ted, barcoded, and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000. Paired end reads were aligned to the human genome HG19 using Tophat2, genes and  counts were summarized using HTSeq. Gene level differential expression  was analyzed using DESeq2.Results: On average, RNA seq generated 18 million high quality reads per  sample, 96% of which mapped uniquely. Hierarchical clustering using the  most variable genes within the dataset distinguished LCM isolated PC and GC samples, including several known PC  or GC specific genes. ASD genes generated from exome sequencing studies were expressed either throug  hout the cerebellum or restricted to PC neurons. Conclusions: LCM is an effective method to enrich for developing PC and GC neurons in human fetal cerebellum. ASD genes are expressed throughout  mid gestation cerebellum or restricted to PC neurons, further substantia   ting cerebellar neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in ASD, and  providing a potential neuronal therapeutic target.

635,769, Structural chromosome 21 specific instability in the diseased brain,P09.046,," Introduction. Chromosome 21 aneuploidy has been shown to affect the di  seased brain especially in individuals with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD). Howe  ver, structural chromosome 21 specific instability has never been a target  for molecular (neuro)cytogenetic studies of the diseased brain. Here, we have addressed chromosome 21 structural variations in single cells of the  AD, schizophrenia and autism brain as well as in the unaffected brain. Materials and Methods. Ten AD, 18 schizophrenia, 12 autism and 20 age  and sex matched samples of the postmortem brain (frontal cortex, Brod   mann area 10) were studied by interphase chromosome specific multicolor  banding (ICS MCB) and NeuN  immunohistochemistry. Results. We were able to show that rare recurrent rearrangements of chro mosome 21 or structural chromosome 21 specific instabilities are found al   most exclusively in the AD brain. These were isochromosomes 21q, 21q22 >qter losses and chromosome 21 breaks at 21q21 and 21q22 affecting 0.6 3.7% of cells. NeuN immunohistochemistry has indicated that the instability  randomly affects NeuN positive and NeuN negative cell nuclei in contrast to  chromosome 21 breaks, which were more prevalent in NeuN positive cell  nuclei.Conclusions. Our data suggests that chromosome 21 specific instability is able to contribute to the AD pathogenesis. One can hypothesize chromoso   me 21 breaks confined to NeuN positive cells of the AD brain to result from the dysregulation of DNA replication/reparation or DNA damage response pathways.

It usually affects boys, but also there are girls affected. Duplication could be de novo or inherited from asymptomatic carrier mother. It has been reported about 120 cases all over the world, wi thout a known incidence.The aim of the study is to characterize a Spanish cohort with MECP2 dupli cation syndrome to improve our knowledge of the disease and perform a genotype phenotype correlation.Material and Method: The cohort consists in 13 patients of both sexes dia gnosed in different Spanish hospitals. The duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array. The clinical characterization was carried out using a checklist designed for the project. The molecular characterization is di vided into several steps: 1) Checking the duplication by qPCR doses, stu dy XCI and FISH; 2) If FISH shows tandem duplication, we narrowed the breakpoints through qPCR, PCR long and Sanger sequencing; 3) Analyze the expression of the two MeCP2 isoforms by RT qPCR.Results: In this collaborative study has been characterized a heterogeneous cohort, with both sexes, with different phenotypes (Rett like and duplicati   on patients) and inherited or de novo duplication located in different regi ons (tandem, other region of ChrX or ChrY). However, this information is not enough to create a clear genotype phenotype correlation.Conclusions: We suppose MECP2 duplication syndrome is an underdia gnosed disease that needs further characterization studies in order to give a better genetic and clinical diagnosis.",2016,,"L.

Molecular and clinical data from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations from other centers were also collected, focusing on developmental aspects and the associated epilepsy phenotype. A review of SYNGAP1 mutations published in the lite rature was also performed.Results: We describe 17 unrelated affected individuals carrying 13 diffe rent novel loss of function SYNGAP1 mutations. Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1 related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviors in eight patients. Hypotonia and unstable gait were frequent as sociated neurological features. With the exception of one patient who ex   perienced a single seizure, all patients had epilepsy, characterized by falls or head drops due to atonic or myoclonic seizures, (myoclonic) absences, and/or eyelid myoclonia. Triggers of seizures were frequent (n,7). Seizures were pharmacoresistant in half of the patients. The severity of the epilepsy did not correlate with the presence of autistic features or with the severity of cognitive impairment. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, but spared spliced 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons. Seizures in patients with mutations in exons 4 5 were more pharmacoresponsive than in patients with mutations in exons 8 15.Conclusion: SYNGAP1 encephalopathy is characterized by early neurodeve lopmental delay typically preceding the onset of a relatively recognizable epilepsy comprising generalized seizures (absences, myoclonic jerks) and frequent triggers.",2016,,"C.

Molecular and clinical data from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations from other centers were also collected, focusing on developmental aspects and the associated epilepsy phenotype. A review of SYNGAP1 mutations published in the lite rature was also performed.Results: We describe 17 unrelated affected individuals carrying 13 diffe rent novel loss of function SYNGAP1 mutations. Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1 related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviors in eight patients. Hypotonia and unstable gait were frequent as sociated neurological features. With the exception of one patient who ex   perienced a single seizure, all patients had epilepsy, characterized by falls or head drops due to atonic or myoclonic seizures, (myoclonic) absences, and/or eyelid myoclonia. Triggers of seizures were frequent (n,7). Seizures were pharmacoresistant in half of the patients. The severity of the epilepsy did not correlate with the presence of autistic features or with the severity of cognitive impairment. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, but spared spliced 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons. Seizures in patients with mutations in exons 4 5 were more pharmacoresponsive than in patients with mutations in exons 8 15.Conclusion: SYNGAP1 encephalopathy is characterized by early neurodeve lopmental delay typically preceding the onset of a relatively recognizable epilepsy comprising generalized seizures (absences, myoclonic jerks) and frequent triggers.",2016,,"C.

650,1260, A comprehensive genome analysis of three constitutional chromothripsis rearrangements: a new mechanism for complex karyotype disorders,P13.12,,"Chromothripsis is a novel phenomenon in the structural variation lands  cape of cancer genomes. We analyzed the genomes of three patients with  congenital disease without apparent karyotype anomalies. The rearran  gements displayed unanticipated complexity resembling chromothripsis.  The array CGH analysis identified complex chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 (Case 1), 12 (Case 2) and 1 and 4 (Case 3). Case 1 presented a complex clinical phenotype in which coexisted 3 known dis   orders: Potocki Lupski syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease and neu rofibromatosis type 1. Case 2 showed intellectual disabilities with autistic  traits and a particular stromal corneal dystrophy, at the moment described  only in adult subjects. Case 3 exhibited a complex clinical picture, not im mediately framed with 1p36 deletion syndrome (array CGH revealed a 3  Mb deletion in 1p36). With whole genome sequencing we investigated the  genetic architecture of these constitutional complex chromosomal rearran  gements (CCRs),copy number profiling, and breakpoint junctions proving  that the rearrangements (deletions/duplications/inversions) identified in our cases were not clustered on a single chromosome region, but on the  whole length of the chromosomes.

652,1380, In silico validation of small CNVs from a dense SNP array,P14.095,,"Introduction: Arrays based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been successful for the large scale discovery of copy number variants (CNVs). However, current CNV calling algorithms have a high false positi ve rate for small CNVs and experimental validation using qPCR or custom arrays is labor intensive and expensive. Therefore, this study looks at the possibilities of an in silico validation approach to distinguish between true  and false positive CNV calls smaller than 100 kb resulting from existing CNV calling algorithms.Materials and Methods: The study sample contains 646 individuals (159 fathers, 157 mothers and 330 children) from 159 families with non syndro mic autism spectrum disorders. All family members were genotyped using the Illumina Human Omni2.5 8v1 SNP array and CNV calls were made using CNV WebStore. The resulting 42,464 CNVs (1 100 kb) were validated in sili   co by comparing the intensities of the underlying SNPs to the distribution of those intensities over all individuals.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  330Back to index Results: Almost half of the CNVs was classified as random noise based on  the underlying SNP intensities. Moreover, comparing the position of parents  and children in the distribution revealed false negative calls in parents re  sulting in de novo CNVs that were actually inherited. Conclusions: The proposed in silico validation approach allows rapid detec  tion of many false positive CNV calls smaller than 100 kb, which could thus be excluded from labor intensive and expensive experimental validation approaches. Ongoing research will validate included and excluded CNVs by qPCR to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the method.",2016,,"N. Cosemans, N. Brison, P . Claes, I. Noens, J. Vermeesch, K.

654,1543, Sapiens specific genetic changes affecting oxytocin pathways,P17.41,,"Introduction: A growing literature suggests that oxytocin pathways (oxt + receptors) must have played a key role in the emergence of human sociality and communication. We wish to provide genetic evidence for this by exploi   ting recent discoveries in the domain of archaic human genomics.Materials and Methods: We have relied on robust findings in the genetic foundations of language (FOXP2 CNTNAP2 pathway), an extensive database oxytocin related search (Pubmed), predictive protein interaction program (String 10), and results from archaic human genomics.Results: We put forth a sapiens specific change (compared to archaic hu mans) affecting the functional connection between OXT , POU3F2, FOXP2, YY1, and CNTNAP2. POU3F2 is known to be necessary for oxytocin cell diffe rentiation. Crucially, a DNase I hypersensitive site accelerated in the human lineage on Chromosome 6 lies in a gene desert 300 kb from POU3F2, which regulates FOXP2 in a sapiens unique manner. Two of the substitutions in this site strengthen a putative YY1 transcription factor binding site. YY1 has been implicated in one of the variants of the CNTNAP2 5Ã¢ÂÂ promoter as risk factors for autism spectrum disorders. YY1 is among the top 10 enriched transcription factors in differentially methylated regions in sapiens vs. ar chaic humans. YY1 binds in a methylation sensitive fashion to an insulator sequence within Peg3. Peg3 knockouts show reduced hypothalamic oxyto cin neurons.Conclusion: We suggest that all these oxytocin related changes are linked and could underlie cognitive and behavioral differences at the heart of our communicative abilities, and open up new avenues in the field of behavioral endocrinology.",2016,,"C.

Detection of low grade mosaicism involves many factors, like the type and number of tissues analyzed, the number of cells studied and the sensitivity of the techniques applied.We describe a case of cytogenetic analysis after amniocentesis in which a normal male karyotype was obtained. Postnatal molecular cytogenetic tests on peripheral blood revealed a low level trisomy 9 mosaicism.Amniocentesis requested for advanced maternal age gave a normal male ka ryotype. Because of poor fetal growth and the pathological CTG emergency cesarean section at 32nd week of gestation was done. At the age of 10 month the propositus was presenting some abnormalities: hypotonia, delayed mo tor development, mild micrognathia, deeper palmar and plantar creases, left eye strabismus, bilateral cryptorchidism and bilateral inguinal hernia.

657,1849, Microdeletion of 10q21,P08.03,,"Introduction: We described the case of a 9 year old boy with a de novo 10q21.3 q22.1 microdeletion, intellectual disability (ID), attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, mucocutaneous pigmentation, and juvenile colon  polyposis (JCP). Methods and Results: Cytogenetic analyses in the proband and her parents was normal; Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) by CytoScan Optima in the patient revealed a deletion of about 4.41 Mb ([hg19] chr10:68,299,927 72,715,960), while CMA of parental DNA was normal. Although no similar size deletions were reported in DECIPHER databa   se, there are several patients with much smaller pure deletions (86.05 to 378.77 Kb) that clustered at CTNNA3 gene (chr10:68,165,545 69,222,108). The most remarkable common feature of these cases was intellectual disa   bility, global developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, the analysis of the gene content of the deleted region showed 40 MIM genes; of which only four have been implicated in autosomal dominant diseases. Our patient does not exhibit any clinical data of those conditions. In or   der to identify that genes could be involved in the phenotype, we analyzed physiologic roles, functional interactions, and also which those are dosage sensitive. The results pointed to CTNNA3 (607667), LRRTM3 (610869) and SIRT1 (604479); all located in 10q21.3, as best candidates. Thus, these three genes may either individually or in combination be responsible for ID with JCP seen in our patient. Conclusions: To the best knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo 10q21.3 q22.1 deletion. This case suggests a novel geno mic disorder at 10q21.3 region associated to ID with JCP .

658,1854, Implementation of aCGH assessment in genetic diagnostic of patient with global development delay/intellectual disability or multiple congenital anomalies Romanian experience,P08.08,,"Introduction: Assessment of DNA copy number through array CGH repre sent a powerful diagnostic tool for clinicians. Genomic microarrays are used as first tier genetic tests in postnatal assessment of subjects diagnosed with unexplained global development delay (GDD)/ intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) in almost all West European countries. Two years ago, we started to imple ment in South West Romania the postnatal aCGH assessment of individuals with unexplained GDD/ID or CMA.Materials and methods: We assessed 30 patients diagnosed with unex   plained GDD/ID or CMA. Conventional cytogenetic evaluation did not de   tect any chromosomal imbalance that could be associated with the clinical phenotype of the patients. DNA isolated and purified from peripheral blood was examined for copy number variations (CNVs) using Roche NimbleGen 3x720K/12x135K or Agilent 4x180K/ 8x60K ISCA design oligonucleotide microarray. Copy number data was analyzed with Nexus 6.1 software (Ne   xus BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA).Results: aCGH assessment identified in several patients submicroscopic changes (microdeletions or microduplications) that could partially explain the clinical phenotype.Conclusion: This study demonstrated the utility and importance of genetic testing through aCGH in the management and counseling of patients with unexplained GDD/ID or CMA and their families.

665,1870, Detection of small SHANK3 deletions in patients with delayed speech and developmental delay using Array CGH,P08.29,,"IntroductionThe 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, also known as Phelan McDermid syndro me (PMS), is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide range of deletion sizes (100 Kb to 9 Mb), and a great phenotypic variability. Most neurologi cal features are thought to be caused by haploinsuficiency of SHANK3 gene, which encodes for a core scaffolding protein at the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. The present study aimed to detect deletions affec ting only to the SHANK3 gene (<100 Kb) so that a better genotype pheno type correlation can be achieved in patients with PMS.Materials and MethodsArray CGH including 15kb resolution for SHANK3 gene (KaryoNIMÃÂ® Au tism 180K array CGH, designed by NIMGeneticsÃÂ®) has been used for ana   lyzing patients suspected to bear PMS. Data analysis was done using hg19 genomic build and ADM 2 statistic (set as 6).ResultsWe identified 8 individuals with 22q13.33 deletions, but only three of them were selected since they harboured pure SHANK3 deletions. Specifically, pa tient 1 and 2 showed a 50 60 Kb deletion affecting exons 10 to 23 and 4 to 23, respectively. On the other hand, patient 3 showed the smallest deletion, being 23 Kb sized and affecting exons 8 to 17. The three patients were dia gnosed with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability. In addition, patient 1 and 3 also showed autism spectrum disorder.ConclusionsThese results supports haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene, which en codes for a structural protein of the postsynaptic density, as a major cau sative factor in the neurological symptoms observed in Phelan McDermid syndrome.

Arieff 1, Noordien Z1, Jacobs CW1, J. R. Sharma1 1Department of Bio   technology, University of Western Cape, Private Bag X17, Bellville 7535, South Africa, South Africa,Introduction: Autism is a highly heritable, heterogeneous, early onset neu ro  developmental condition characterized by three core pervasive impair ments. This condition is clinically heterogenejous with complex etiopa thogenesis which can be conceptualized as a dynamic interplay between environment cues and predisposing genetic factors. Recent studies have reported that variants of the CNTNAP2 gene are associated both with lan   guage deficits and language delays in autism. So CNTNAP2 is considered as a strong candidate for the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Material and Methods: A case control study was performed to identify asso   ciation of two SNPs (rs2710102 and rs759178) of CNTNAP2 gene and ASD in a South African population. Genomic DNA was extracted from oral swab samples of 117 cases and 123 controls and SNP genotypes were determined. The Taqman ÃÂ®Real Time PCR and genotyping assay were utilized to deter   mine the genotypes. Results and Conclusion: None of the SNPs (rs2710102 and rs759178) within CNTNAP2  tested are associated significantly with  ASD. These negative findings may be due to the limited sample size in the present study. E",2016,,"Z. arieff, Z. Noordien, C. Jacobs, J.

670,1887, CGH arrays analysis in a series of pediatric patients suffering from neurological diseases and/or congenital malformations of unknown etiology,P09.14,,"Background and aims:CGH arrays (Comparative Genomic Hybridization Arrays) are powerful and innovative technologies whose implementation is allowing an extraordinary change in the diagnosis of various diseases, es   pecially in the diagnostic and research of intellectual disability, autism and malformation syndromes. Our aim was to analyze, by CGH arrays, a series of patients affected by several neurological diseases and/or malformations to try to determine the etiology of the disease in these patients.Methods: A total of 66 pediatric index patients with normal karyotype were analyzed for Copy Number Variations by CGH arrays using CGXÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 8 plex (Agilent Technologies). Proband patients were clinically classified as: au   tism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n,30), intellectual disability (n,17), mal   formation syndromes (n,9), psychomotor delay (n,8), hypotonia (n,1) and early puberty (n,1).Results: 10 pathogenic (or probably pathogenic) variants and 21 variants of unknown significance were detected. Pathogenic or probably pathogenic variants were identified in 3 patients with psychomotor delay (and other features), 3 patients with intellectual disability, 3 patients with ASD and in one patient with hypotonia and malformations. 6 of the 10 variants were previously described and associated to known syndromes (Prader Willi syndrome (n,1), 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome (n,1), 16p11.2 microde   letion syndrome (n,1), 22q11 deletion syndrome (n,2), and a tetrasomy of 15q11.2 region (n,1)).Discussion and conclusions: Array CGH is a rapid and cost effective techni   que for postnatal screening of unknown syndromes, intellectual disability and autism sprectrum disorders.

671,1890, Double heterozygous missense variants in CHRNA7 in a boy with autism spectrum disorder,P09.17,,"Introduction: Dosage sensitivity of the CHRNA7  gene, which encodes the  ÃÂ±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the human brain, is known to have a major contribution to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including  autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and intellectual disability (ID). CHRNA7  is included in the smallest region of overlap of the 15q13.3  deletions and duplications, a hotspot for Copy number variants (CNVs) due to the presence of segmental duplications, favoring non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) occurrence. Heterozygous or homozygous deletions are usually associated with a neurodevelopmental phenotype of high pene  trance. Case Report: Using exome sequencing after negative extensive genetic work up in a 13 year old Caucasian boy presenting with ASD, intellectual disabili  ty and developmental delay, with no facial dysmorphism or malformations,  and normal growth, we identified two heterozygous missense mutations in the CHRNA7  gene. The first one, p.Ala124Thr in exon 5 was inherited from  his asymptomatic father, and the second one p.Tyr233Cys in exon 7, occur   red de novo.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of ASD in a boy with double heterozygous missense variants in CHRNA7 . Given the interest to  wards this gene in neuropsychiatric disorders, and the interest in the ge netic dissection of ASDs, international data sharing will be of importance in order to determine if missense mutations could be responsible for neurode   velopmental phenotypes.

This syndrome comprises ID, childhood hypotonia and distinctive facial features. In the reviewed literatu   re, to our knowledge only 114 cases were published so far, so the incidence is unknown in general population. The array CGH is a very powerful tool that can help us to diagnose patients with a deletion of EHMT1.Case report: We report a case of a blood study for arrayCGH study with a wide clinical history. The clinical features of this girl of about 4 months were,  psychomotor retardation with pathological motor development, axial hypo  tonia, lack of head control, heart disease (ASD + VSD + pulmonary steno sis), microcephaly, upper lip V inverted shaped, and clear skin.

A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ï¬uence genetic risk. I.M.

TBL1XR1 mutations have been reported to be associated with autism, autosomal dominant mental retardation(OMIM: 616944) and Pierpont syndrome(OMIM: 602342). Only two cases with genedeletions have been reported: a single case with mild developmental delay(DD) and a 1.6 Mb de novo deletion at 3q26.31q26.32; and a familial case (mother/daughter) withmoderate intellectual disability(ID) and facial dysmorph  isms with a 708 kb deletion at 3q26.32. We report a 5Â½ year old male with global DD, growth retardation and dys morphisms with a 3q26.32 de novo deletion, being TBL1XR1 the only known coding gene within the deletion. TBL1XR1 encodes a ubiquitously expressed protein that localizes to the nucleus and plays a role in transcription mediated by nuclear receptors.

Materials and Methods: We undertook CMA in 377 patients with idiopathic DD/ID,ASD, or MCA and 64 probands âfamilies (parents or sib  lings) recruited from four tertiary hospitals and conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients to quantify theproportion of cases where CMA results impacted manage  ment recommendations for clinical action. Results: A total of 68 patients (68/377, 18.0%) had clinically relevantresults, either abnormal (n ,36) or variants of possible signiï¬cance (VPS, n ,32). The diagnostic yields of CMA were signi ï¬cantly higher than those of banding cytogenetics (22/377, 5.8%, P< 0.001). Twenty four well known  diseases were detected; Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome was the most common (n ,4) and followed by DMD, 7q11.23 duplication, 15q11 q13 duplication, 16p11.2 microdeletion, 17p13.3 duplication, and DiGeorge syn  drome. The size of variants of abnormal and VPS cohortsranged from 142Kb to 151 Mb (median, 3.2 Mb). For patients with clinical follow up available, CMA results had management implications for 87.5% and 78.1% of patientswith abnormal variants (28/32) and with the VPS (25/32), respectively. Clinical recommendations included medical referrals, diagnostic imaging, pharmacological treatment,and contraindications.

689,237, A novel KDM6B gene de novo mutation in two siblings with a variable neurocognitive phenotype,P08.29,,"Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Praha 5   Motol, Czech Republic Introduction: The clinical  and genetic heterogeneity of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) poses a signi ï¬cant diagnostic challenge. Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ï¬rst line diag  nostic  and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22  and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con  ï¬rmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme  thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ï¬ed a thirdâmutation âinKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ï¬ndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

699,262, Copy number variations (CNVs) of Alzheimer âs disease susceptibility genes in a pediatric clinical cohort,P09.17,,"1Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russian Fed  eration,2Academician Yu.E. Veltishchev Research Clinical Institute of Pediatrics, N.I. Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

Incomplete penetrance of theaffected genes and variable expressivity usually is indicated as cause of clinical features. Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities.Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro  mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol  vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ï¬rmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet. Five disease related genes arelocated in affected region and only haploinsuf ï¬ciency sen  sitive TBX6 has indirect effect on neural development. V. Å liuas: None. B. Aleksiuniene: None. E.

The phenotype of affected individuals ranges from lethal arthro  gryposis multiplex to mild intellectual disability or autismspectrum disorder. Approximately 30 cases have been reported to date, but data on prenatal phenotype are scarce. Methods : We performed a ï¬le review of six patients (including three from the same family, and two siblings) diagnosed after birth with Schaaf Yang syndrome at our centers in a clinical setting, compiled prenatal andmolecular data, and reviewed the literature. Results : Prenatal ï¬ndings in our patients include fetal akinesia (2/6), pyelectasis (2/6), increased nuchal translu cency (1/4), intra uterine growth retardation (1/6), contrac  tures (1/6), and cerebral anomalies (1/6). All were severely affected after birth with progressive contractures anddevelopmental delay. Two had severe hydronephrosis, while another had renal failure. Molecular analyses identi ï¬ed truncating variants in MAGEL2 : c.1762C>T, c.3043C>T, and c.1996dupC. We reviewed data on 33 cases reported between 2009 and 2017, including 10 with prenatal manifestations. Prenatal features include fetalakinesia (7/10), contractures (4/10), and polyhydramnios (3/10). In addition, two children without reported prenatal features were small for gestational age. Conclusions : Although Schaaf Yang syndrome can present prenatally, the features may be mild or absent. Fetal akinesia, contractures, and polyhydramnios arerecurrent, but are absent in more than 50% of cases. The syndrome should be considered when fetal akinesia or contractures are associated with growth retardation, pye lectasis or oligohydramnios. G. D'Amours: None. F. Rossignol: None. F. Rypens: None.

The deletion occurs near the end of the chromosome at a location designated q13.3.In addition to normal growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological de ï¬cits which include global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual impairment, absent or severely delayed speech, and decreased muscle tone (hypotonia). Some people with this condition have autismor autistic like behavior that affects communication and social interaction, such as poor eye contact, sensitivity to touch, and aggressive behaviors. They may also chew onnon food items such as clothing. Less frequently, people with this condition have seizures. Patient 1: 9 year old girl patient Genetic Diseases Diagnosis referred to our center with autism like behaviors. The chromosome structure was determined as 46,XX.

The molecular analysis consisted on Comparative Genomic Hybridization array (aCGH) (Agilent 60K), Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Ampli ï¬cation (MLPA) self customized to analyze the CNV âs inheritance in parents and siblings and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) using the BAC clone RP11 359O20 to characterizethe CNV. Results: aCGH analysis of the patient revealed an interstitial deletion on Xp22.3 involving the Xp22.3 region.The deletion encompasses approximately 1.6 Mb (arr[hg19] Xp22.31(6,488,721 8,097,511)x0) and contained HDHD1, STS, VCX, PNPLA4 and MIR651 genes. MLPA analysis conï¬rmed the deletion in the proband, reported a duplica  tion in his sister and grand mother and a normal MLPA dosage was shown in his mother and his maternal uncle.The grandfather has icthyosis too but he did not accept genetic testing. In order to decipher the normal MLPA result in the mother we applied FISH that shows amicroduplication in one X chromosome and a microdeletion in the other one.

721,182, Novel WAC frameshift variant in a boy with DeSanto Shinawi syndrome revealed using whole exome sequencing,P08.33,,"1Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Charles University 2nd Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic,2Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Diagnostic and Research Unit for RareDiseases, Charles University 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic DeSanto Shinawi syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the WAC gene. It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep  set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC  related phenotype and its developmental tra  jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype  ï¬rst approach.

722,184," Xp11.22 microduplication including IQSEC2 gene in amale with intellectual disability, epilepsy and dysmorphic features",P08.35,,"University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil X linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a group of genetically highly heterogeneous disorders and one of the most frequent genetic causes of ID occurring in 5 10% of all affected male individual s. Around 100 genes have been considered as determinant of XLID and the role for many of them remains to be elucidated. Here, we described a male with ID, epilepsy, severely impaired speech,abnormal behavior with hyperactivity and some aggres  siveness, optic nerve atrophy and craniofacial dys  morphisms as brachycephaly, frontal hair upsweep,prominent nose and ears, evert ed lower lip, narrow palate, dental crowding, among others; hands and feet minor anomalies were also observed. Array CGH (Agilenthuman genome G3 SurePrint 8x60K microarray) dis  closed a 416 kb duplication which extends from ChrX (hg19): 53,253,932 to 53,670,215. This variation wasconï¬rmed by MLPA technique and Real Time PCR ana  lysis showed the maternal inheritance. The duplicated region encompasses the IQ motif and Sec7 domain  containing protein 2 gene (IQSEC2 ), which has a sig  niï¬cant role in the brain main tenance and homeostasis. Although a consistent phenotype of non syndromic XLIDwas observed in individuals with IQSEC2 alterations, the additional features observed in present patient suggest a syndromic form related to Xp11.22 duplications and alsosupport the hypothesis that IQSEC2 has a role in patho  genesis of syndromic XLID. In addition, the inclusion of IQSEC2 variations among the causal factors when eval  uating ID patients with seizures could be considered.Clinical details of male patients with Xp11.22 submicroscopic duplications involving the IQSEC2 gene Patient [Reference]Intellectual DisabilityEpilepsy Language developmentVisual impairmentBehavioural disturbancesOther clinical featuresChrX(hg19) Coordinates and Duplication size Present Case Mild  ModerateNeonatal seizuresSeverely impaired speechOptic nerve atrophy, enophtalmiaHyperactivity, aggressive behaviorCorpus callosum agenesis and slight ventricular system enlargement,craniofacial dysmorphic features, including enophtalmia53,253,932  53,670,215 416 kb A009 [Froyen et al., 2008]Mild â Speech delay â Hyperactivity Normal facial features53,220,275  53,981,275 761 kb A057 [Froyen et al., 2008]Mild â Limited speech in later lifeâ Hyperactivity Not present 52,987,689  53,712,958 725 kb A119 [Froyen et al., 2008]Mild  ModerateFebrile seizuresSpeech delay â Attention deï¬cit hyperactivity disorderNo signi ï¬cant dysmorphic features52,825,617  53,662,768 837 kb AU88848 [Froyen et al., 2012]Mild ââ â â â 53,169,907  54,101,252 931 kb FTD[Froyen et al., 2012]Mild Cortico  subcortical dysfunctionSpeech delay â Attention deï¬cit hyperactivity disorderFunctional heart murmur, chronic vomiting and diarrhea, urolithiasis, bilateral inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, facial dysmorphicfeatures53,198,95  54,237,527 1,038 kb F538 [Froyenet al., 2012]Moderate â Limited speech, StutterUnequal pupils â Large head circumference53,216,303  54,239,6701,023 kb ON1[Froyen et al., 2012]Mild  Moderateâ Partial lack of speechMicrophthalmos Hyperactivity and attentionproblems, self  destructing behaviorFacial dysmorphicfeatures52,982,784  53,721,295 730 kb Patient 1 [Tran Mau Them et al., 2014]Severe Generalised myoclonicseizuresNot aquired Hypermetropia, strabismusStereotypic handmovementsNeonatal hypotonia,postnatal microcephaly, hyperkinesia, normal facial features53,283,513  53,325,284 42 kb Patient 3 [Tran Mau  Them et al., 2014]Severe Partial epilepsyRegression Strabismus Midline stereotypic hand movementsNeonatal hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, nonspeci ï¬c hypersignal foci in periventricular white matter,minor facial features53,276,030  53,298,472 22 kb P611 [Santos  RebouÃ§as et al., 2015]Moderate Not present Speech delay Enophtalmia Hyperactivity and attention problems, aggressive behaviorAbnormal gait, brachycephaly, enophtalmia, dysmorphic facial features53,316,256  54,074,258 758 kb P3272 [Santos  RebouÃ§as et al., 2015]Moderate Seizures Speech delay â Hyperactivity Dysmorphic facial features53,228,169  54,133,735 905 kb Patient 1 [Moey et al., 2016]Not determinedâ Speech delay â Poor socialization, behavioral problemsDownward corners of the mouth52,954,520  53,315,542 361 kb Patient 2 [Moey et al., 2016]Mild  Moderateââ â Autism spectrum disorder, challenging behavior, physical aggression, avoided eyecontactâ 52,911,287  53,315,010 403 kb Patient 3 [Moeyet al., 2016]Global delay â Speech delay, poorpronunciationâ Signi ï¬cant behavioraldifï¬culties requiring a special education classâ 52,789,239  53,368,927 579 kb Patient 4 [Moey et al., 2016]Severe Constant generalized sharp slow dischargesNo words, little receptive languageâ Smile and shaking handsHypotonia, microcephaly, hypogonadism, myoclonus, not walk, dysmorhic facial features52,341,517  53,782,896 1,441kbAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: â¦ 955P.P.

Obregia Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry, Bucharest, Romania,4Victor Babes National Institute of Pathology, Bucharest, Romania,5Titu Maiorescu University, Bucharest, Romania Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairment of social interaction,reduced communication skills and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The etiology of ASD is complex including genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. 2q13 dupli cation have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, ASD and dysmorphism. Several previous studies have linked the NPHP1 gene, located inthis genomic region, to ASD. In this paper we report a new case of 2q13 duplication in association with ASD and intellectual disability. The patient is a 5 years old boy bornat term from health, non consanguineous parents who was referred to the department of Child Psychiatry for speech delay and behavioral problems. Clinical evaluation revealeddysmorphic features (high forehead, large protruding ears, open held mouth), severe speech delay (he says only 6 simple words), moderate intellectual disability, autisticbehavior (no visual contact, dif ï¬cult social interaction, stereotypic movements). The genomic pro ï¬le obtained by array CGH (Agilent platforms) unveiled a 645 Kb dupli cation at 2q13 (110457697 111103309, hg18) encompass  ingRGPD6 ,MALL andNPHP1 genes. To date, 11 cases with 2q13 microduplication, including NPHP1 andMALL genes, have been reported. All patients presented behavior problems including ASD, attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder. Intellec tual disability was also noted in 8 patients. Other features described in some cases were speech delay and dysmorphic traits. All these ï¬ndings were found in our case, further contributing to the delineating of the 2q13 microduplication. I.O.

Here we report autistic behaviour patient with lack of speech and developmental delay that was referred for genetic testing. Both father andbrother of the proban are heterozygous carriers of beta  talasemia mutations. The patient was previously tested for Fragile X syndrome and X linked mental retardation relatedgenes were sequenced as well as whole exome sequencing was performed without detecting any relevant variants correlating with the clinical features. The only positiveresult was for HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genes predisposing to celiac disease. At the end aCGH array (180K) was per  formed and it detected 278kb duplicated region (11p14.3 /chr11: 22102205 22361578) that included the ANO5 and SLC17A6 genes. This duplication was interpreted as uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance based on the international recommendations. Second aCGH analysis with higher resolution (2,7M) was perform so we can gain additional information and eventually to clarify the previous ï¬nding. An additional duplication of 312 kb was detected in chro  mosome 15 (15q11.2), which included 4 genes: TUBGCP5 , CYFIP1 ,NIPA2 and NIPA1 (PMIDs: 28588435, 27566550). Duplication was inherited by the father who is without clinical manifestation. The 15q11.2 BP1 BP2 region is found duplicated or deleted in people with cog nitive, language, and behavioral impairmen and a variable phenotype so probably this ï¬nding is the leading cause for the clinical features in the affected child.

Materials and Methods: We examined a 6 years old male patient with a mild dysmorphic features: short palpebral ï¬ssures, long eyelashes, large ears with ï¬eshy lobe and outward turned helix, hyperlaxity of joints. The boy is only child of non consanguineous healthy parents with no history of congenital anomalies or developmentaldelay. The boy was born with uses of vacuum extraction after 41 weeks of an uneventful pregnancy. At birth, he presented macrosomia (4230g/57cm, head circumference37cm), bilateral postaxial polydactyly and stridor. Devel  opmental delay presented from early stages, later he demonstrated poor speech. He was diagnosed autismspectrum disorder at the age of 3 years. At the age of 5 years he demonstrated subclinical epileptiform activity on EEG. Results : Chromosomal microarray analysis using Affy  metrix Cytoscan 750k array revealed a 6 Mb microdeletion960 J. del Picchiaat 4q24 region (arr[hg19] 4q24(101574821_107631432) x1). Due to bioinformatics assay deletion was classi ï¬ed as variant of unknown signi ï¬cance. However, deletions comprising the region 4q24 have recently been described among individuals with an overlapping phenotype. The CXXC4 gene located in deleted region might be a candidategene for postaxial polydactyly, as it inhibits the Wnt  signaling pathway and subsequently transcription of GLI3 gene, which is associated with polydactyly. Conclusions: We assume that the 4q24 locus is associated with a combination of polydactyly and mental retardation. Finding candidate genes associated withcognitive impairment is a potential target for further investigation. O. Novoselova: None. E",2018,,"O.

A total of 13/21 pathogenic CNVs were observedin 8 patients, all located at genetic ASD hotspots, including 22q11.23, Xp22.33 (2/13), 16p11.2 (3/13), harboring no OMIM genes. However, the hotspots at 15q13.3, 15q11.2(2/13), and Xp11.23 (2/13) harbored CHRNA7 ,PWRN2 and ZNF630 genes, respectively, associated with ASD. The remaining CNVs were classi ï¬ed as having unknown clinical signi ï¬cance, distributed at loci: 2q12.2, 3p22.1, 9p21.1 (3/8), Xp22.32, Xq21.1, and Xq24.

Popa âUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy   Department of Medical Genetics, Ia Åi, Romania Williams Beuren (WS) syndrome (7q11.23 microdeletion), is a syndrome with wide clinical variability. We have stu  died 22 patients diagnosed with WS and followed up for a long time (average period 7 years) in Iasi Medical GeneticsCenter, aiming to describe clinical variability and the changing picture in time. All cases were con ï¬rmed using MLPA follow up kit. We identi ï¬ed cardiovascular disease in 18/22 patients (72.22% supravalvar aortic stenosis), characteristic dysmorphic faces in 19/22, intellectual dis  ability in 19/22 (5 severe, 9 moderate, 5 mild) and con nective tissue defects in 16 cases (40.95% presented hernia). Less common features included: pre  and early post natal growth de ï¬ciency (18/22), friendly personality (16/22), speciï¬c cognitive pro ï¬le (13/22), strabismus and dental anomalies (9/22), gastro intestinal disturbances (9/22), obesity (6/22), hypercalcemia (3/22) and hypothyroidism(1/22).

Despite a wide variety of available data, speci ï¬c biological processes underlying abnormal neurodevelopment remain to be unmasked. Here, we have used molecular cytogenetic data to analyze speci ï¬c pathways leading to neuropsychiatric diseases in children. Materials and Methods: Conventional and molecular karyotyping was used to evaluate 427 patients with idiopathic intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, andcongenital malformations. An original bioinformatic tech  nique based on candidate process prioritization (Iourov et al., 2014; Yurov et al., 2017) was applied to pathwayenrichment among these patients. Results: Molecular cytogenetic analysis has shown CNVs relevant to a pathway functional change in 397children (93%). The highest enrichment rates (gene percentage among all the prioritized candidate genes/ processes) were found for the following pathways: cellcycle (4.68%), MAPK signaling (6.56%), pathways in cancer (11.94%), DNA replication (1.64%). All the children exhibiting the genomic variations altering genes involved inthese pathways were found to present with chromosome instability (mosaic aneuploidy, chromosome breaks/fragi  lity, non speci ï¬c structural chromosomal rearrangements), whereas the remainder was not demonstrating de ï¬nable chromosome instability. Conclusions: Alterations to pathways associated with genome/chromosome stability maintenance through the cell cycle were shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. The consequences of the altera tions were found to be detectable at chromosomal level. These data supports a previously proposed hypothesis describing two /multiple hits to genome stability as apossible mechanism of neuropsychiatric diseases (Iourov et al., 2013).

Their high genetic heterogeneity hinders the devel  opment of effective gene based therapies. We have recentlydemonstrated that the microRNA miR 204 is essential for retinal function and plays a pathogenic role in IRD in humans. Therefore, we investigated the potential ther apeutic action of this microRNA in IRDs. Materials and Methods: We delivered by subretinal injection an adeno associated viral vector carrying the miR 204 precursor to the Aipl1 knockout and the P347S  RHO transgenic mouse lines, models of autosomal recessive and dominant forms of IRDs, respectively. The impact on retinalfunction and degeneration was assessed by electroretino  graphic and immunohistological analyses. Results: We detected a notable improvement of the ERG response in the miR 204 injected eyes of P347S  RHO mice. This effect persisted for two months post injection and was prevalent under photopic conditions that re ï¬ect cone activity. We also observed a preservation of cone photo  receptors and a signi ï¬cant decrease in apoptotic photo  receptor cells. Photoreceptors were better preserved also inthe miR204 injected eyes of Aipl1 knockout mice. Tran  scriptome analysis suggested that dampening of microglia activation represents one of the main mechanisms under lying the neuroprotective effect of miR 204. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings indicate that the subretinal delivery of miR 204 attenuates retinal degeneration in IRDmouse models and preserves retinal function, supporting the gene independent therapeutic potential of this microRNA.

Hydration of their reduced forms (either spontaneously if the temperature is elevated or following speciï¬c enzymatic processes) leads to the accumulation of NADHX and NADPHX, which are toxic and can inhibit a number of dehydrogenases. Highly conserved dehydrataseNAD(P)HX Dehydratase (NAXD) is one of the key intra  cellular NADHX/NADPHX repair enzymes. Materials and Methods: We describe 6 unrelated children with generally fever induced recurrent episodic neurological impairment and/or cardiac failure with early demise, and its genetic basis. Results: Genomic sequencing revealed biallelic NAXD variants in all cases, and in silico analyses predicting potential pathogenicity for each of them. Pathogenicity wasfunctionally validated using patient ï¬broblasts through a combination of transcript analysis (splicing abnormality in one case), demonstration of markedly elevated S NADHX,R NADHX and cyclic NADHX, impaired mitochondrial function, and reduced viability in culture media containing galactose and azide but not glucose. Transduction withwildtype NAXD restored damaged metabolite levels back to normal. Finally, in vitro studies revealed that the two missense variants [(p.(Gly63Ser) and p.(Arg608Cys)] werethermolabile, and speci ï¬c ATP dependent NADHX dehy  dratase activity showed abnormal enzyme kinetics. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst report of a human disorder caused by NAXD de ï¬ciency, showing remarkable clinical overlap with the other known defect of the NADH/NADPH repair pathway, NAXE de ï¬ciency.

Deletion cause Williams Beuren syn  drome (WBS) characterized by hypersociability, anxiety and intellectual disability, while duplication give rise to 7qduplication syndrome (7DupASD) with severe impairments in language, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the well established genetic underpinnings of thesedisorders effective treatments are unavailable. Converging evidence points to GTF2I as a major player mediating the cognitive behavioral phenotype associated with WBS and7DupASD. We showed previously in patient derived iPSC and neural progenitors that GTF2I associates with LSD1 to suppress expression of genes involved in neuronal function,whereas inhibition of LSD1 restored gene expression balance. Here we used mouse models together with patient derived 3D cortical organoids and single cell transcriptomics to dissectthe molecular foundations of WBS and 7DupASD. Mice with duplication of GTF2I faithfully recapitulated the ASD like phenotype in the three chambered sociability apparatus.Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1 with an irreversible inhibitor, rescued the ASD like phenotype. Bulk and single cell RNAseq from cortical organoids revealed divergent dynam ics of neuronal maturation with accelerated maturation in 7DupASD and decelerated in WBS organoids resulting in a divergent neural fate, which was con ï¬rmed by relative abundance of basal progenitor populations. Strikingly, knockdown of GTF2I in 7DupASD organoids rescued neu  ronal maturation rate to control levels. These ï¬ndings suggest that GTF2I LSD1 axis plays a critical role in social behavior and cognition by controlling the timing of cortical maturation. A. Lopez Tobon: None. R. Shyti: None. E.

737,7, miR 204 overexpression exerts a protective role in inherited retinal diseases,PL2.6,,"1Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM), Pozzuoli, Italy,2Dept. of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy,3Department of Translational Medicine, University of Naples 'Federico II', Naples, Italy Introduction: Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are pro  gressive neurodegenerative conditions of the retina thatrepresent a main cause of genetic blindness in the Western world. Their high genetic heterogeneity hinders the devel  opment of effective gene based therapies. We have recentlydemonstrated that the microRNA miR 204 is essential for retinal function and plays a pathogenic role in IRD in humans. Therefore, we investigated the potential ther apeutic action of this microRNA in IRDs. Materials and Methods: We delivered by subretinal injection an adeno associated viral vector carrying the miR 204 precursor to the Aipl1 knockout and the P347S  RHO transgenic mouse lines, models of autosomal recessive and dominant forms of IRDs, respectively. The impact on retinalfunction and degeneration was assessed by electroretino  graphic and immunohistological analyses. Results: We detected a notable improvement of the ERG response in the miR 204 injected eyes of P347S  RHO mice. This effect persisted for two months post injection and was prevalent under photopic conditions that re ï¬ect cone activity. We also observed a preservation of cone photo  receptors and a signi ï¬cant decrease in apoptotic photo  receptor cells. Photoreceptors were better preserved also inthe miR204 injected eyes of Aipl1 knockout mice. Tran  scriptome analysis suggested that dampening of microglia activation represents one of the main mechanisms under lying the neuroprotective effect of miR 204. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings indicate that the subretinal delivery of miR 204 attenuates retinal degeneration in IRDmouse models and preserves retinal function, supporting the gene independent therapeutic potential of this microRNA.

Hydration of their reduced forms (either spontaneously if the temperature is elevated or following speciï¬c enzymatic processes) leads to the accumulation of NADHX and NADPHX, which are toxic and can inhibit a number of dehydrogenases. Highly conserved dehydrataseNAD(P)HX Dehydratase (NAXD) is one of the key intra  cellular NADHX/NADPHX repair enzymes. Materials and Methods: We describe 6 unrelated children with generally fever induced recurrent episodic neurological impairment and/or cardiac failure with early demise, and its genetic basis. Results: Genomic sequencing revealed biallelic NAXD variants in all cases, and in silico analyses predicting potential pathogenicity for each of them. Pathogenicity wasfunctionally validated using patient ï¬broblasts through a combination of transcript analysis (splicing abnormality in one case), demonstration of markedly elevated S NADHX,R NADHX and cyclic NADHX, impaired mitochondrial function, and reduced viability in culture media containing galactose and azide but not glucose. Transduction withwildtype NAXD restored damaged metabolite levels back to normal. Finally, in vitro studies revealed that the two missense variants [(p.(Gly63Ser) and p.(Arg608Cys)] werethermolabile, and speci ï¬c ATP dependent NADHX dehy  dratase activity showed abnormal enzyme kinetics. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst report of a human disorder caused by NAXD de ï¬ciency, showing remarkable clinical overlap with the other known defect of the NADH/NADPH repair pathway, NAXE de ï¬ciency.

Deletion cause Williams Beuren syn  drome (WBS) characterized by hypersociability, anxiety and intellectual disability, while duplication give rise to 7qduplication syndrome (7DupASD) with severe impairments in language, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the well established genetic underpinnings of thesedisorders effective treatments are unavailable. Converging evidence points to GTF2I as a major player mediating the cognitive behavioral phenotype associated with WBS and7DupASD. We showed previously in patient derived iPSC and neural progenitors that GTF2I associates with LSD1 to suppress expression of genes involved in neuronal function,whereas inhibition of LSD1 restored gene expression balance. Here we used mouse models together with patient derived 3D cortical organoids and single cell transcriptomics to dissectthe molecular foundations of WBS and 7DupASD. Mice with duplication of GTF2I faithfully recapitulated the ASD like phenotype in the three chambered sociability apparatus.Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1 with an irreversible inhibitor, rescued the ASD like phenotype. Bulk and single cell RNAseq from cortical organoids revealed divergent dynam ics of neuronal maturation with accelerated maturation in 7DupASD and decelerated in WBS organoids resulting in a divergent neural fate, which was con ï¬rmed by relative abundance of basal progenitor populations. Strikingly, knockdown of GTF2I in 7DupASD organoids rescued neu  ronal maturation rate to control levels. These ï¬ndings suggest that GTF2I LSD1 axis plays a critical role in social behavior and cognition by controlling the timing of cortical maturation. A. Lopez Tobon: None. R. Shyti: None. E.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col  laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var  iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand  or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno  types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region con  tains up to 10 genes and is associated with numerous conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD),epilepsy, schizophrenia and intellectual disability; however, the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis remain unknown. 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region impactsten genes and it is very complex to unravel the critical gene or genes that regulates the phenotype. Materials and Methods: We combined whole genome sequencing, human brain gene expression (proteome and transcriptome), and a mouse model with a syntenic heterozygous deletion (Df(h15q13)/ +mice) and determined that the microdeletion results in abnormal development of cortical dendritic spines and dendrite outgrowth. Large scale genetic data was integrated to ï¬nd out the most critical gene (s) within the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region. In addition, we have applied functional analysis in vivo and in vitro to identify phenotypes in mouse and human celllines. Results: Analysis of large scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data identi ï¬edOTUD7A as a critical gene for brain function. OTUD7A expression was found to localize to dendritic and spine compartments in cortical neurons, and its reduced expression in Df(h15q13)/ +cortical neurons contributed to the dendritic spine and dendrite outgrowth deï¬cits. Conclusions: Our results reveal OTUD7A as a major regulatory gene for 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotypes that contribute to the disease mechanism through abnormal cortical neuron morphologicaldevelopment.

Human accelerated regions (HARs) repre  sent conserved genomic loci with elevated divergence in humans compared to other primate and non primate species.At least some HARs are thought to contribute to neurode  velopmental functions underlying the unique social and behavioral traits of humans. If some HARs regulate human speciï¬c social and behavioral traits, then mutations would likely impact cognitive and social disorders. Recent studies support the role of HARs in complex neurodevelopmentalfunctions and associated disorders including Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia.

Here, we systematically dissected the functional networks associatedwith 16p11.2 RGD from transcriptome analyses of 70 mice with reciprocal CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region across cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, as well as liver, white andbrown adipose tissues in a subset of 16 mice (n ,250 samples). We integrated these data with brain tissues from a Kctd13 mouse model (a putative driver of 16p11.2 neu  roanatomical phenotypes, n ,50), and CRISPR engi  neered, isogenic 16p11.2 iPSC derived NSCs (n ,25) and induced neurons (n ,27). The strongest magnitude of effect sizes from 7qF3 were observed across brain regions by comparison to non brain tissues (cortex 7qF3 region aver  age p value ,8.80E 35; non brain p ,0.0013), re ï¬ecting the ~3x higher basal expression changes. Coexpression network analyses isolated a consistent module of 16p11.2 genes, as well as a module that was highly enriched forconstrained genes (ExAC pLI â¥0.9), autism associated genes, early fetal development coexpression networks derived from BrainSpan, and neurological phenotypes andprocesses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in this âconstrained âmodule network; moreover, DEGs from the Kctd13 mouse coalesced into this samemodule (cortex enrichment p ,7.82E 41), suggesting overlap in altered transcriptional networks between full length CNV and deletion of KCTD13 alone. These analysesidentify a tissue speci ï¬c impact of 16p11.2 RGD that converges on a module of co expressed genes that are intolerant to genetic perturbation and associated with criticalprocesses in human neurodevelopment.

The homeobox protein NKX6 2 is a transcription factor regulating multiple developmental processes with a main role in oligoden drocyte differentiation and regulation of myelin speci ï¬c gene expression. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and homozygosity mapping of selected patients from three unrelated families was undertaken. The variants identi ï¬ed were validated by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation analysis. Results: Five affected subjects (three unrelated families) were documented to share biallelic inactivating mutationsaffecting the NKX6 2 homeobox domain. A trio based whole exome sequencing analysis in the ï¬rst family detected a homozygous frameshift change [c.606delinsTA;p.(Lys202Asnfs*?)]. In the second family, homozygosity mapping coupled to whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.565G>T) introdu cing a premature stop codon (p.Glu189*). In the third family, whole exome sequencing established compound heterozygosity for a non conservative missense changeaffecting a key residue participating in DNA binding (c.599G>A; p.Arg200Gln) and a nonsense substitution (c.589C>T; p.Gln197*), in both affected siblings. Theclinical presentation was homogeneous, with four subjects having severe motor delays, nystagmus and absent head control, and one individual showing gross motor delay atthe age of 6 months. All exhibited neuroimaging that was consistent with hypomyelination. Conclusions: Theï¬nding of individuals with a severe neurodevelopemental phenotype with hypomyelination associated with biallelic mutations in NKX6 2 provides direct evidence of the relevant role of NKX6 2 in CNSdevelopment in humans.

Genetic bases are prominent riskfactors for both disorders. Among others, loss of function mutations in CHD8 gene represents a recurrent risk factor for ASD, while CHD2 is more frequently mutated in epi  lepsy. Thus, the sole reduction in CHD8 orCHD2 expres  sion is able to cause cellular and molecular phenotypes that are key hallmarks to follow and rescue in assessing newtherapeutic approaches. Particularly, we aim to test SINEUPs, a novel class of synthetic antisense long non coding RNAs   able to increasethe translation of target proteins to physiological level without affecting transcription   to rescue the phenotypes caused by CHD8 orCHD2 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. Since the activity of SINEUP depends on two domains, an effector domain required for translation enhancement and a binding domain conferring target speci ï¬city, we designed SINEUP molecules able to recognize the initial and internal methionines of CHD8 and CHD2 proteins. We then proceeded to test the ef ï¬cacy of different SINEUPs on neural progenitors. From our preliminary observations, SINEUPs targeting internal methionines are more ef ï¬cient in stimulating CHD8 and CHD2 protein production, thusrepresenting a valid target to be further tested in patients â derived cell lines and in zebra ï¬sh, an in vivo model of the disorders.

745,77,D The role of next generation sequencing in the differential diagnosis of congenital iris anomalies,P02.02,,"Genetics Department, IIS FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az  CIBERER, UAM, Madrid, Spain Abnormal development of the iris is a feature of severalcongenital ocular malformations. Classical aniridia, the most common form, is a panocular disease characterized by iris and foveal hypoplasia, keratopathy, cataracts andglaucoma, caused by PAX6 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. The pre  sence of variable expressivity and phenotypic overlapping with other types of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD)hinders the genetic characterization of atypical presentations of aniridia. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of NGS to improve the clinical diagnosis of these pathologies. Acohort of 106 families was studied, including cases with classical aniridia or atypical forms (iris hypoplasia, atrophy or coloboma). The entire PAX6 gene and other 260 genes associated with ocular malformations were analyzed using custom targeted NGS and aCGH approaches, as well as clinical or whole exome and/or Sanger sequencing. About82% of the cases presented likely pathogenic variants or CNVs in 5 different genes. Defects in PAX6 explain 75% of cases, including not only all characterized cases withclassical aniridia, but also 30% of patients with more atypical presentations, in whom LOF or atypical missense and non coding variants were identi ï¬ed, respectively. Other aniridia like patients presented pathogenic variants in ASD  related genes or variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance in candidate genes. Molecular analysis of iris malformationspresents high diagnostic yield not only in cases with classical aniridia (95%) but also in patients with aniridia  like phenotypes (>50%). Our work evidences the clinicalutility of differential genetic studies based on NGS in patients with congenital iris anomalies.

It varies from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifesta tions and an increased risk of toxicity from 5  ï¬uorouracil treatment. Materials and Methods: A child with severe autistic behavior, intellectual disability (no speech at 6 years old) and family history   aunt with mental retardation, was referred for genetic counseling. Metabolic screening wasperformed in urine sample by dipstick   glucose, ketone, pH, and reducing sugars, followed by LC MS/MS blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines and GC/MS urine organicacids analysis. Mutations in DPYD gene are reported in DPD de ï¬ciency patients. The gene was investigated by direct Sanger sequencing in proband and his parents. Results: Elevated levels of thymine and uracil were detected by GC/MS urine test which was suggestive of DPD deï¬ciency. Molecular analysis of DPYD gene showed a homozygous splice site mutation c.1905 +1G>A in the proband, inherited from heterozygous parents.

In vivo andin vitro studies have shown an important role of the Notch ligand DLL1 in the development of the nervous system and somites, amongothers. We identi ï¬ed 14 individuals from ten unrelated families with heterozygous DLL1 variants by exome sequencing. The most common features in our cohort were intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, seizures and variable brain malformations. Four patients had scoliosis includingone with a vertebral segmentation defect. We identi ï¬ed six nonsense variants, two splice site variants, one missense variant affecting a highly conserved cysteine in the DSLdomain, and one 122 kb deletion containing DLL1 . Ana  lysis of the splice site variant NM_005618.4:c.54 +1G>A showed an in frame insertion of 12 bp near the sequencecoding for the signal peptide, possibly affecting proper localization of the mutant DLL1 protein. The features in our cohort resemble those of patients with overlapping terminaldeletions of 6q27 encompassing DLL1 , supporting the previous hypothesis that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of DLL1 is causative of the phenotype in this deletion. In conclusion, we identi ï¬ed heterozygous mutations in DLL1 in a cohort with a variable neurodevelopmental phenotype and other multi system features. Our clinical andmolecular data support haploinsuf ï¬ciency as a mechanism for the pathogenesis of DLL1  related disorders and illustrate the importance of DLL1 in human brain development.

However, the phenotypic spectrum of individuals heterozygous for CHD8 truncating variants has not been clearly de ï¬ned. We investigated 26 individuals with CHD8 protein truncating variants (PTVs), including 10 previously unreported patients, and found a1380pattern of common features: macrocephaly (76%), tall stature (65%), developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD/ID, 81%), autism spectrum disorders (ASD, 81%), sleep dif ï¬culties (48%), gastrointestinal problems (42%), and distinct facial features.

The majority of reported patients harbored de novo loss of function (LoF) variants. To date, the phenotype of only four patients has been precisely described in the literature, contrasting with the relative frequency of detection of such LoF GATAD2B variants. Here, we describe 10 patients with con ï¬rmed LoF GATAD2B variants and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Methods: Patients were included by contacting referent clinicians from several French genetics departments. Results: Developmental delay was severe with a median age of 2.4 years (range [2 5]) for independent walking and of 2.75 years (range [1 4]) for ï¬rst spoken words. They showed very little subsequent progress, one patientremaining non verbal at age 30 years. ID was mostly moderate, with only one severe and one mild case, which differs from the original description of severe ID. Mostcommon dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, downturned mouth and, anomalies of the extremities. Conversely, prenatal compli cations, non cerebral organ malformations, epilepsy and autistic behaviour were very rare. One patient presented asthma and recurrent respiratory infections, another onepresented severe feeding dif ï¬culties and developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and IgG de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: NGS based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of GATAD2B variations. Better knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for a cor  rect interpretation of the molecular results and for anaccurate management of these patients. G. Vera: None. A. Sorlin: None. G.

Material and Methods: In a collaborative initiative we have identi ï¬ed 11 patients with neurodevelopmental dis  orders and ASD phenotype with loss of function(LoF) mutations in the ASXL3 gene. Exome sequencing was used as a diagnostic tool and Sanger sequencing was used forfamilial segregation. The mutational spectrum of ASXL3 was revised in public_data (PubMed, Clinvar, SFARI). Results: We identi ï¬ed 10 new ASXL3 LoF variants and one recurrent mutation (c.3106C>T;p.Arg1036Ter).

764,451,A Autism monozygotic twins with APBA2 gene duplication vary for tick development,P09.018,,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is neurological and developmental disorder that begins earlyin childhood and lasts throughout a person's life, character  ized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and non verbal communication. Large genome rearrangements are being identi ï¬ed in ASD as an under  lying cause for development of this syndrome. These rearrangements are mostly deletions, but duplications canbe found. We present case of twin boys with APBA2 gene duplication. Materials and Methods: Twin boys, age 9 were referred to genetic counseling and testing with diagnosed ASD (DSM IV). DNA was isolated from buccal swabs of the boys, and 3 ml of whole blood from parents. Parents pro vided completed questionnaires for tick disorders in chil  dren as well as Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ). Identi ï¬cation of mutations was made with MLPA (multiplex ligase dependent probe ampli ï¬cation) technique, with MLPA kits P343 and P339 (Mrc Holland). Results: All samples were typed successfully. We iden  tiï¬ed de novo APBA2 gene duplication in both twins. This gene, located on 15q13.1 locus is already associated with autism features. DCDQ scores are similar in twins withindication of DCD. Assessment of the Questionnaires for tick disorders in children revealed that one sibling is com  pletely absent for ticks while other has high score for sec tion related to vocal and involuntary ticks.

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome.

Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028).

Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together.

Semantic similarity score, ranging from 0 to 1 represents the functional similarity between two genes, where 1 represents identical genes while score 0reï¬ects functionally dissimilar genes. Agglomerative hier  archical clustering of the computed gene similarity matrix identi ï¬ed four different clusters of functionally related genes. Silhouette analysis indicated that clusters were compact and consistent (average Silhouette value ,0.31). The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD. Cluster 1 genes were also most signiï¬cantly enriched for Schizophrenia Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term, which is a co occurring condition with ASD. The other three clusters were not enriched for ASD related HPO terms. The results indicated thatphenotypic genotypic associations can established for ASD by reducing its genotypic heterogeneity i.e. clustering of functionally similar genes. However, to associate theseclusters with phenotype, further efforts are required to enrich HPO resource. (Grant reference: PTDC/CCI BIO/ 28685/2017) A.C.G. IlhÃ©u: None. M. Asif: None. F.M.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components.

Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection.

We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis  localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm.

Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Madrid, SpainIntroduction: The Spanish Undiagnosed Rare Diseases Program (SpainUDP) performs extended genetic analyses and deep phenotyping to get a de ï¬nite diagnosis in rare syndrome cases. We present the case of a 3 year old male with severe generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness together with neurodevelopmental delay. He presentsmicrocephaly and dysmorphic features highlighting micro  retrognathy, low set ears and hypertelorism. Materials and Methods: Trio based exome analysis was carried out by using Nextera Truseq Rapid Enrichment kit and sequenced in NextSeq500 (Illumina). Results: The exome analysis revealed a novel mutation consisting on a small de novo 30 bp deletion in exon 9 of AUTS2 gene (Autism susceptibility candidate 2, OMIM:607270), which allowed the diagnosis of this patientas AUTS2 Syndrome or Mental Retardation, autosomal dominant 26 (OMIM:615834). AUTS2 gene is involved in the development of neurological disorders. Alterations ofAUTS2 gene were described as a result of genomic rear  rangements, although large copy number variations and intragenic deletions or mutations have also been describedto cause this syndrome. It is noteworthy that the deletion found in this patient included the transcription start site of the short isoform of the gene, which plays an important rolein brain development. The gene expression analysis showed that the deletion causes reduction in the level of expression not only of the short isoform but also of the completetranscript of the gene. Conclusions: This case helps in establishing the genotype phenotype correlation adding more evidence tothe role of mutations speci ï¬cally affecting the short isoform for the development of a severe phenotype.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT  qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail  able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers.Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange  ment.

Materials and Methods: An eight year old girl born from a non consanguineous couple, presented a progressive motor sensory axonal polyneuropathy and subsequentlydeveloped cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia and cognitive decline. She underwent SMN1 deletion testing, NMD gene panel analysis and a trio WES. Results: WES led to the identi ï¬cation of a de novo c.1535C>T variant (p.Pro512Leu) in the CAPRIN1 (Cell Cycle Associated Protein 1) gene. This variant is not presentin 1000G and gnomAD. CAPRIN1 has reduced tolerance to missense (Z ,1.79) and is intolerant to nonsense variants (pLI,1.0). CAPRIN1 is abundant in the adult brain, where it regulates the transport and translation of mRNAs of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Moreover, it contains an LC/ ID domain and it is a component of stress granules.Mutations in proteins containing LC/ID domains (TDP43, TIA1, hnRNPA1/2) cause MNDs and increase the like  lihood of protein aggregates formation. Several in silico tools predict that the p.P512L mutation to increase the aggregation propensity. Indeed, experiments in HEK293T cells show that CAPRIN1 P512Lforms bulky aggregates as compared to CAPRIN1WT. Moreover, an insoluble protein extraction assay demonstrates that CAPRIN1WTelutes in the RIPA soluble fraction while CAPRIN1P512Lin the urea soluble one. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CAPRIN1P512Lis prone to aggregation.

Carr2, E. Sheridan1,2, J. Adlard1, D. T. Bonthron1,2 1The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom,2University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom With the widespread use of low cost genome wide diagnostic screening tests, unanticipated but possibly pathogenic dosage changes affecting single genes arediscovered with increasing frequency. Clinical management demands facile validation of such incidental ï¬ndings, often necessitating the design of custom variant speci ï¬c assays. Although deletion variants can be readily con ï¬rmed using a range of next generation sequencing strategies, characteris  ing duplication variants, at nucleotide resolution, remainsdemanding. We have addressed this challenge by deploying a novel Cas9 enrichment strategy combined with long read Oxford Nanopore MinIon sequencing. We used bulkgenomic DNA without the need for PCR ampli ï¬cation. We present the diagnostic resolution of two problematic cases in which incompletely characterised duplicationvariants had been identi ï¬ed by array CGH. The ï¬rst patient presented with learning dif ï¬culties and autism spectrum disorder, but had been found to have an incidental 1.7 kbimbalance which included a partial duplication of VHL exon 3. This was inherited from the patient âs father, who had renal cancer aged 38 years. In the second case, we identi ï¬ed an incidental 200 kb duplication which included DMD exons 30 44. Parental testing was consistent with this variant having arisen de novo . In both cases, the single  molecule sequencing yielded suf ï¬cient information to deï¬ne precisely the architecture of the rearranged region, enabling Sanger sequencing assays across the integrationsites and surrounding homologous regions (that likely gave rise to the duplicated sequences). Adoption of this approach by diagnostic laboratories promises to enable rapid andcost effective characterisation of challenging duplication  containing alleles. C.M. Watson: None. L.A.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels.

De novo missense variants in this gene have been linked to developmental disorders (DD) in a large scale study ofpatients with severe undiagnosed DD (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Only ï¬ve patients have been reported to date and clinical data remains very scarce. We report a new patientwith COL4A3BP  related intellectual disability (ID) aiming to contribute to the recognition of this condition. Materials and methods: Clinical data was collected from the patient âs medical records and compared with previous reports from scienti ï¬c literature and databases. Results: A 5 year old girl with unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery, presented with postnatal microcephaly, axial hypotonia, and severe global864 J. del Picchiadevelopmental delay. Short stature and facial dysmorphisms were noted and, at 24 months, she developed generalized seizures. Currently, she does not walk unaided, says only one word, and has poor visual contact and marked stereotypic behavior with bruxism. Whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a de novo pathogenic variant in COL4A3BP (S260L). Conclusions: This missense variant was previously found in 4 out of 5 known patients, suggesting a mutational hotspot in this gene. Former functional evidence indicates itresults in intracellular imbalances in ceramide, pivotal to the synthesis of sphingolipids.

Several ultra rare NDD associated variants in numerousgenes speci ï¬c almost to single families have been identi ï¬ed by unbiased next generation sequencing technologies. To determine the genetic component of NDD in a con sanguineous family from Turkey, we have performed SNP  based homozygosity mapping in the family along with whole exome sequencing (WES) in the affected sib pair. The SNP genotyping data generated on two different array chips was combined with PLINK to detect homozygous stretches common to the affected sib pair. The WES data wasï¬ltered for rare alleles with predicted pathogenic impact on protein function in the homozygous loci. This collective effort has led us to identify a loss of function variant in NALCN in the homozygous state. Sanger sequencing has con ï¬rmed segregation of this variant with the NDD phenotype in the pedigree. NALCN encodes a member of sodium leak channel complex and is associated with a recessive OMIM phenotype; Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (MIM:615419) Our study presents the combined analysis of linkage and exome analysis as a powerful and precise tool to diagnose a clinically rare and recessively inherited condition onmolecular level.

De novo mutations in CHD3 result in Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome (#MIM618205), characterized by global developmental delays and/or intel  lectual disability, speech delay, macrocephaly, hypotoniaand facial dysmorphism. The vast majority (~95%) of pathogenic mutations reported so far are missense muta  tions. Interestingly, CHD3 is predicted to be extremely intolerant for loss of function variance. Non penetrance and/ or variable expressivity has not been reported. Here we describe two cases with seemingly pathogenic, but inher ited, protein truncating variants in CHD3 . In a 4 year old girl with global developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, severe feeding dif ï¬culties, and facial dysmorphisms, ï¬tting with the spectrum of Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome, whole exome sequencing revealed a nonsense variant, p.(W1217*), in the CHD3helicase domain. The variant was inherited from her healthy mother and grandmother. In a 3 year old boy with developmental delays, pre  dominated by speech delay, another maternally inherited nonsense variant, p.(S1443*), was found. Facially, he resembled the gestalt previously described for SnijdersBlok Campeau syndrome. His mother, in whom the variant872 J. del Picchiawas de novo, had macrocephaly and was otherwise unaffected. These two cases exemplify that protein truncating variants inCHD3 may result in reduced penetrance and/or variable expressivity. We are currently collecting more families with inherited CHD3 variants to enhance our understanding of disease penetrance in Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome. Additionally, we will perform functional studies of these CHD3 variants to increase our insight in the underlyingpathogenic mechanisms. J. van der Spek: None. J. den Hoed: None. L.

There are reports of 16p11.2 deletion in the literature, describing variable clinical pre sentation in patients. Most of them describe developmental delay, autism and seizures, however phenotypic pattern is undistinguishable and variable. There is still no suf ï¬cient clinical data of this CNV in babies. Case report: We report on a patient with developmental delay and complex seizures. This is a second child in afamily, the pregnancy and delivery was uneventful. Microcephaly, foramen ovale and generalized hypotonia were noticed shortly after birth. At the age of 3 months hedeveloped infantile spasms, followed by profound devel  opmental delay within the next several months. He has microcephaly, early closure of the fontanel, high forehead,bitemporal narrowing, wide nasal root, narrow palpebral features, upper lip notch, short neck, cryptorchidism. Karyotype was normal. aCGH analysis (using Affymetrix Â® CytoScan TM750K Array) showed deletion of 16p11.2 (1.430 kb), also deletion on chromosome 14q11.2 (433 kb), both are considered as pathogenic according aDGVdatabase. Discussion and conclusion: Deletion of the 16p11.2 is mostly described in older children that developed autisticspectrum of disorder, ADHD, etc. Wide clinical variability is described between patients, mostly due to the variations on size and breakpoint of the deleted region. There are someinconsistencies in phenotype described in literature, how  ever this could be a part of a changing phenotype with age.

813,255, Neurodevelopmental disorders and chromatin remodel ing dysregulation: the lessons from Kabuki syndromespectrum and clinical presentation of Tunisian cases,P11.056,,"Kaabi, W. Ltaif, S. Aloulou, S. Mallek, S. Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ï¬lled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen  tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ï¬nally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ï¬ve cardinal manifestations of KB deï¬ned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ï¬nitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ï¬rmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N.B. Abdelmoula: B.

A homo  zygous knockout of the orthologous Satb1 leads to mice lethality, demonstrating its importance in early development. Methods and results: Here, we report on 26 individuals with SATB1 variants. Seventeen patients have missense variants predicted to be deleterious, and nine have truncating variants, three of which predicted to escapenonsense mediated decay. 21 of 26 variants (80%) were conï¬rmed to be de novo in origin. Patients showed a broad phenotypic spectrum, including ID and/or neurodevelop mental delay, epilepsy, dental abnormalities and aspeci ï¬c brain MRI ï¬ndings. Additionally, patients with missense variants are more severely affected than those withtruncating variants. We characterized the effects of eight different missense mutations, including two recurrent variants, in cell based assays. Compatible with a gain of function effect of missense variants, mutated SATB1 proteins showed altered nuclear localization and increased transcriptional repression on two characterized targets (IgH MAR site and the IL2 promoter). Consistent with this hypothesis, ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments demonstrated a decrease in mobilityof mutant SATB1, suggesting stabilization of DNA binding underlying the increased transcriptional activity. Transcrip  tome analysis is currently ongoing to further substantiatethese ï¬ndings. Conclusions: In summary, through multi center colla  borations, we show that SATB1 is associated with an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder, resulting from distinct mutation speci ï¬c pathophysiological mechanisms.

The most frequent cause of mono  genic ID   the fragile X syndrome  is due to the absence of the RNA binding protein (RBP) FMRP. Many other IDgenes have been implicated in the RNA metabolism. NOVA2 is a RBP known to regulate neuron speci ï¬c alternative splicing (AS). We identi ï¬ed 6 individuals with de novo frameshift variants in NOVA2 affected with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by ID, motor and speech delay, autistic features, spasticity or ataxic gaitand abnormal brain MRI. All variants cluster in a small GC  repeat rich region, located in the last exon, indicating that the mutated transcript might escape to nonsense mediated decay. All 6 frameshift variants lead to the addition of a novel common C terminal part instead of the last KH RNA binding domain, suggesting a dominant negative mechan  ism. We detected 41 genes differentially spliced after downregulation of NOVA2 in human neuronal cells. TheNOVA2 variant protein shows decreased ability to bind target RNA sequences and to regulate target AS events. It also fails to complement the effect on neurite outgrowthinduced by NOVA2 downregulation in vitro and to rescue alterations of retinotectal axonal path ï¬nding induced by loss of NOVA2 ortholog in zebra ï¬sh. Our results showed that truncating mutations in NOVA2 cause a syndromic form of ID, suggesting a hypomorphic mechanism rather than a full heterozygous loss of function, although a speci ï¬c con  tribution of the novel C terminal extension cannot be excluded.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 33F.

Pro  tein truncating variants (PTVs) in the last two exons of SRCAP cause Floating Harbor syndrome (FLHS), which is characterized by typical facial features, short stature with delayed bone age and expressive speech delay. We report on novel genotype phenotype correlations, associated withSRCAP PTVs outside the FLHS locus. We identi ï¬ed 21 probands with PTVs upstream, and 5 with PTVs downstream of the reported FLHS locus. Mostpatients presented with speech delay and intellectual disability. In contrast to FLHS, they have normal height and bone age. Moreover, facial recognition algorithms on2D photos showed that patients with upstream and down  stream PTVs do not cluster with the FLHS facial gestalt. The upstream PTVs result in subtle facial dysmorphism,autism spectrum disorder, severe behavioral problems and joint issues, such as hypermobility and premature degen  eration. In contrast, patients with downstream PTVs haveneurodevelopmental delay and Marfanoid habitus. At the molecular level, FLHS is characterized by a unique DNA methylation (DNAm) signature consisting of ~570differentially methylated CpGs. The DNAm pro ï¬les of the upstream and downstream PTVs yielded different signa  tures from FLHS. In summary, we delineate the phenotype of patients with SRCAP PTVs outside the FLHS locus. None of the patients show clinical features typical for FLHS. Analysis at the molecular level suggests that each clinical entity is associated with its own molecular mechanism. We proposethat the upstream PTVs result in haploinsuf ï¬ciency, whereas the downstream PTVs and FLHS causing variants result in distinct dominant negative or gain of functioneffect. D. Rots: None.

Recently, clinical reas  sessment highlighted the high prevalence of gastrointestinal(GI) defects in ASD. Transient suppression of chd8 in zebra ï¬sh led to a reduced number of enteric neurons and a decreased gut mobility which likely drive the GI problems(Bernier et al. Cell, 2014). Materials and Methods: To understand how the loss of chd8 causes the loss of mature enteric neurons, we generated and characterized a stable mutant zebra ï¬sh line: Tg(chd8 sa19827;phox2bb:GFP ) in which the neuronal pro  genitors (i.e. enteric neural crest cells, eNCCs) are labeledwith GFP. Results: First, we observed a migration delay and reduced proliferation of eNCCs during early developmentand a decreased number of mature neurons and more speciï¬cally serotonergic neurons at 5 days post fertilization. Second, transcriptomic analyses of eNCCs revealed theupregulation of the serotonin receptor htr6 and the dysregulation of several actors of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity and RhoA pathways, extracellular matrix compo nents, and several genes from the human morbid genome. Third, behavioral analyses showed i) hyperactivity of the mutant chd8 larvae and ii) normal sociability and no aggressive behavior in the adult mutants.

Pre synaptic disorders, characterized bycongenital nystagmus and photophobia, night blindness, are known as cone rod synaptic disorder (CRSD) can be mis  taken for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Full  ï¬eld electroretinogram is crucial for the differential diagnosis, but it can be dif ï¬cult to perform in young children. Here, we report (i) the identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in the RIMS2 gene encoding a pre synaptic protein not yet asso  ciated with human diseases in 3/4 families initially referred for LCA and (ii) the diagnostic adjustment to CRSD withvariable associated alteration including autistic behavior and insulinopathy. Methods : Exome sequencing combined with targeted RIMS2 testing were performed in 46 prescreened patients with CRSD and 94 with LCA. Biallelic RIMS2 mutated cases underwent ophthalmologic, neurologic and metabolicassessment. RIMS2 immunostaining was performed on human retina, brain and pancreas. Nonsense variants were functionally investigated in mammalian cells. Results.Biallelic RIMS2 sequence variants were found in four unrelated families. RIMS2, a protein regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis localizes in the human retinal outerplexiform layer, Purkinje cells and pancreatic islets. Apart from CRSD, neurodevelopmental disease was observed in all cases, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in the eldestpatient.?Nonsense variants lead to truncated RIMS2 and decreased insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Conclusion : This is the ï¬rst report of syndromic CRSD with neurodevelopmental or pancreatic involvement due to RIMS2 loss of function. The disease presentation is con  sistent with the localization and function of RIMS2. S. Mechaussier: None. B. Almoallem: None. C. Zeitz: None. K. Van Schil: None. L. Jeddawi: None. J.

Introduction: Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that can be isolatedor syndromic. Biallelic ALDH1A3 variants are responsible for 11% of recessive AM cases, mostly described in consanguineous families, and present severe bilateral AM with variable neurodevelopmen tal anomalies. We present six families with biallelic ALDH1A3 variants, further characterising the associated phenotype. Material and Methods: AM individuals from UK, France and Spain were analysed by WES, targeted gene screening and arrays. Results: We identi ï¬ed 6 families: Family 1) with two brothers with bilateral anophthalmia, one present additional developmen tal delay, absent speech and autism with compound heterozygousALDH1A3 variants (c.874G>T:p.(D292Y);c.1393A>T:p.(I465F)); 2) a boy with bilateral anophthalmia, developmental and intellectual delay, seizures and autistic features with compound heterozygous variants (c.845G>C:p.(G282A);c.1459A>G:p.(R487G)); 3) a girl withbilateral microphthalmia and coloboma with compound hetero zygous variants (c.847_849del;p.(G283del);c.953C>A,:p.(S318Y)); 4) a girl with bilateral anophthalmia with a homozygous missense variant (c.1144G>A:p.(G382R)); 5) a boy with bilateral microphthal mia, unilateral coloboma and cataract, with a homozygous splice variant (c.1233 +2T>C) and 6) a boy with bilateral microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, facial dysmorphism with ahomozygous missense variant (c.434C>T:p.A145V). Conclusions: Three of the six families presented with com pound heterozygous variants, highlighting this mode of inheri tance in ALDH1A3 related disorders. Five of 6 families had a variant in the catalytic domain, supporting the importance of this domain,which is critical for substrate selectivity. Severe neurodevelop mental phenotypes were present in two individuals, and variably penetrant in family 1, supporting that this can be an importantfeature of the ALDH1A3 syndrome.",2021,,Y.

The whole exome sequencing test identi ï¬ed in the CDK13 gene a heterozygous variant p. (Asp855Glu). To our knowledge, this variant is not reported before, and it is absent in the general population in the control databases. In silico analysis, predict adeleterious effect of this variant. Based on the ACMG guidelines,this variant is classi ï¬ed as a likely pathogenic variant. There are no variants identi ï¬ed in other genes in this child; this gene can most likely explain this child âs phenotype.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorders or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorders (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorders without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

Only subjects with normal chromosomal microarray analysis results who met inclusion criteria, were offered to participate. Overall, 280 consecutive families were included. In250 (89.3%) families, the index case had NDD. In 252 of the families(90.0%), a trio WES was performed.

Patient 2 was a 1 year old girl and the younger sister of Patient 1.She was referred to genetic evaluation because of the developmental delay and low muscle tone. Metabolic and mitochondrial DNA testing resultswere normal in both patients. In an attempt to establish thediagnosis Whole exome sequencing was carried out. Results: Both patients underwent Whole Exome Sequencing. The two siblings carried compound heterozygous mutations in theSPATA5 gene: c.554G>A(p.Gly185Glu) and c.1831C>T(p.Pro611 Ser). The variants were con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. Conclusions: Our results describe new, probably pathogenic variants in SPATA5 gene, and we con ï¬rm that bi allelic pathogenic variants in SPATA5 cause a syndromic form of intellectual disability.

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families.

Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families. The identi ï¬ed biallelic damaging variants could affect the CACNA1H protein activity with a recessive model and contribute to the disease development in the context of a high risk genetic background. Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.Supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Grant GR 2013 02357561).",2021,,M.

Purpose : Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis, class G (PIGG) is an ethanolamine phosphate transferase catalyzing themodi ï¬cation of the second mannose of glycosylphosphatidylino sitol (GPI). GPIs serve as anchors on the cell membrane by linking over 150 surface proteins called GPI anchored proteins (GPI APs)on their third mannose. Pathogenic variants in genes involved inthe biosynthesis of GPI cause inherited GPI de ï¬ciency (IGD) which still needs to be further characterized. Methods: We describe twenty two individuals from nineteen new unrelated families with bi allelic variants in PIGG .W ea n a l y z e dG P I A P surface levels on granulocytes and ï¬broblasts for three and two individuals, respectively. We demonstrated enzymatic activity defectsforPIGG variants in vitro in a PIGG /PIGO double knockout system. Results: Phenotypic analysis of reported individuals reveals novel PIGG de ï¬ciency associated features. All tested GPI APs wereunchanged on granulocytes whereas FLAER and CD73 levels in ï¬broblasts were decreased. In addition to common symptoms such as hypotonia, intellectual disability/developmental delay, and seizures, individuals with PIGG variants of null or severelydecreased activity showed cerebellar abnormalities, neurologicalmanifestations, and mitochondrial dysfunction, a feature increas ingly recognized in IGDs. Individuals with mildly decreased activity variants showed autism spectrum disorder. Conclusion: This in vitro system is a useful method to validate the pathogenicity of new variants in PIGG and to study PIGG physiological functions. Recent work using this system has identi ï¬ed a new subset of PIGG dependent GPI APs with an alternative bridging on the second mannose.

Introduction : Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are charac terized by genetics and phenotypic heterogeneity. Thus, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) studies combined with a clinical evaluation can be a powerful approach maximizing moleculardiagnostic yield. Heterozygous pathogenetic variants in POGZ gene have been associated to a syndromic NDD, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID) and some dysmorphic facial features. Material and methods : A multicentric, Italian WES data sharing has been carried out with the aim of providing a complete clinical and neurocognitive picture of patients with a similar phenotypic characteristic (a diagnosis of POGZ related disorder), and negativeto SNPs/CGH molecular karyotyping. Result, new perspectives : All collected cases resembling a POGZ related disorder (n ,13; 8 male) presented with ID (from mild to severe), a global DD, usually exhibited behaviouralimpairments and, in ï¬ve cases, a diagnosis of ASD. The identi ï¬ed, novel pathogenetic or likely pathogenetic variant in POGZ include frameshift (5), stop (3), splicing (2) and missense (1) variants,mostly occurring de novo , except for a familiar case (3 subjects). Considering the unmet medical needs for most life longing NDDs and recent evidences on the improvement of behavioural impairments in POGZ knock in mice, we propose new careperspectives through the inhibition of glutamatergic signal and the mitigation of excitatory neurons. A recruitment of patients with POGZ related disorder is dare for ongoing.

SHANK2 mutations have been consistently associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the speci ï¬c consequences of these mutations at the molecular/cellular level, including the cell types/developmental stages that are crucially relevant for thephenotype, remain unclear. A fundamental question is whetherthe affected processes are limited to synapse formation/function, or if the pathobiology of the disorder starts earlier, either in differentiating neurons or already in neuronal progenitors. Wehave reprogrammed ï¬broblasts from a trio âtwo neurotypical parents and their daughter diagnosed with ASD, harboring a de novo 120 kb deletion in SHANK2 âinto induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and subsequently differentiated them into neuralstem cells (NSCs). For comparison, we used four additional iPSC lines: one derived from a patient with a heterozygous nonsense mutation in SHANK2 (R841X), a CRISPR/Cas9 engineered homo zygous SHANK2 knockout line, and their respective isogenic controls. Interestingly, only the NSCs derived from the deletion patient presented a strikingly different morphology, whereas the other SHANK2 deï¬cient lines were indistinguishable from wildtype cells. Moreover, the SHANK2 deletion NSCs showed a tendency towards premature differentiation into neurons. The discrepancy between the phenotypes, coupled with comparable SHANK2 levels in the deletion patient and controls, suggests that thealtered phenotype might be caused by genetic factors indepen dent of SHANK2 expression. In fact, this SHANK2 deletion removes not only exon 16, but also a large portion of the adjacent intron.This region harbors numerous enhancers hypothesized to berelevant for general neural differentiation, and their deletion could contribute to the observed phenotype.",2021,,F.B.

The main features of patients with an 8q21.11 deletion encompassing this gene are intellectualdisability, hypotonia, short stature, and a peculiar facial pheno type. Corneal opacity has been frequently reported and some of the subjects also show a wide range of severe eye abnormalities. Case report: We describe a female patient with mild intellectualdisability and autism spectrum disorder. She had brachycephaly with ï¬at occiput, wide forehead, strabismus, monolateral ptosis, epicanthic folds, low set, prominent, posteriorly rotated ears, longand smooth philtrum, thin lips, high arched palate, microretrog nathia, short 4 thand 5thmetacarpal bones, lumbar hyperlordosis. Clinical Exome Sequencing revealed the presence of the hetero zygous de novo pathogenic variant c.3093 +1G>T in the ZFHX4 gene. This variant is located in a canonical donor splice site,suggesting a possible alteration of the splicing process and a loss of protein function. Conclusions: Severe eye abnormalities occur with a high frequency in patients with large 8q21.11 deletions. They range from Peters anomaly to cataract, microphthalmia, sclerocornea, corneal opacity, pigmentary retina degeneration. None of theseabnormalities have been reported in patients with ZFHX4 point mutations, intragenic deletions, or small deletions encompassing only ZFHX4 .

872,1255,D Further evidence that the pathogenic variant p,P22.001,," Arg592Trp in the AARS2 gene is not necessarily lethal Tessi Beyltjens , Katrien Janssens, Geert Mortier Center for Medical Genetics, Antwerp University/Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium. Background :AARS2 is a nuclear gene encoding the mitochondrial enzyme alanyl tRNA synthetase. Bi allelic mutations in AARS2 are known causes of early onset cardiomyopathy or late onset leuko dystrophy. Until very recently, the p.Arg592Trp variant, either in thehomozygous or compound heterozygous state, has been exclusively and repeatedly described in infants with severe cardiomyopathy or primary pulmonary hypoplasia, both resulting in death before theage of 1 year. Nielsen et al. (2020) however reported one girl who developed dilated cardiomyopathy in her teens. Case report : We report on a 6 year old boy who was referred for genetic evaluation because of global developmental delay anda severe autism spectrum disorder. Pregnancy and perinatal course were uneventful. Besides gastro oesophageal re ï¬ux there were no general health problems. Exome sequencing revealed thehomozygous presence of the pathogenic variant c.1774C>T (p.Arg592Trp) in AARS2 . Both healthy parents, who denied con sanguinity, were heterozygous carriers. MRI of the brain did not show structural abnormalities or signs of leukodystrophy. AnAbstracts from the 54thEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference 559 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:88 â 608echocardiogram revealed a borderline thickness of the left ventricular wall (z score: 2.4).

Background :AARS2 is a nuclear gene encoding the mitochondrial enzyme alanyl tRNA synthetase. Bi allelic mutations in AARS2 are known causes of early onset cardiomyopathy or late onset leuko dystrophy. Until very recently, the p.Arg592Trp variant, either in thehomozygous or compound heterozygous state, has been exclusively and repeatedly described in infants with severe cardiomyopathy or primary pulmonary hypoplasia, both resulting in death before theage of 1 year. Nielsen et al. (2020) however reported one girl who developed dilated cardiomyopathy in her teens. Case report : We report on a 6 year old boy who was referred for genetic evaluation because of global developmental delay anda severe autism spectrum disorder. Pregnancy and perinatal course were uneventful. Besides gastro oesophageal re ï¬ux there were no general health problems. Exome sequencing revealed thehomozygous presence of the pathogenic variant c.1774C>T (p.Arg592Trp) in AARS2 . Both healthy parents, who denied con sanguinity, were heterozygous carriers. MRI of the brain did not show structural abnormalities or signs of leukodystrophy. AnAbstracts from the 54thEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference 559 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:88 â 608echocardiogram revealed a borderline thickness of the left ventricular wall (z score: 2.4).

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes.

874,11," Leveraging public epigenomic datasets to examine the role of regulatory variation in complex traits Sushmita Roy University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, USA",S01.2,," Many variants identi ï¬ed by genome wide association studies (GWAS) occur in non coding sequences. Understanding theimpact of such variants on complex phenotypes is a signi ï¬cant challenge. This is because such regulatory variants can affect the expression of gene hundreds of kilobases away, and the targetgenes themselves are part of a larger unknown biological pathway. High throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technologies that measure the three dimensional proximityof genomic loci at high resolution (e.g. 5kb) can be used to linkgenes to regulatory variants over long distances, but they exist only for a handful of model cell lines due to high sequencing costs. We have developed a computational framework forpredicting such data, comprising (1) a Random Forest basedregression model to predict in silico contact counts of pairs of genomic loci, and (2) a multi task subnetwork identi ï¬cation approach to identify potential pathways targeted by a set ofvariants from a GWAS study. Our count prediction approach takes as input one dimensional signals such as histone modi ï¬cations, chromatin accessibility and accessible sequence motifs ofarchitectural proteins such as CTCF and predicts the contactcount for pairs of regions. We trained our approach on ï¬ve high resolution Hi C datasets and applied the trained models to 55 human cell lines and tissues from the Roadmap Epigenomics6 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 â 87project using both measured and imputed features. Our predic tions, when aggregated to a lower resolution (e.g. 40kb), accurately recapitulate the measured low resolution contact count, as well as identify larger units of 3D chromosomeorganization. Signi ï¬cant interactions from our predicted counts are associated with increased gene expression and enriched for interactions from ChIA PET experiments. We used our compen dium of signi ï¬cant interactions to predict target genes of regulatory SNPs associated with traits from the NHGRI GWAScatalog. We applied our multi task graph clustering approach to identify subsets of cell types associated with a phenotype of interest, e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia.We found that the subnetworks are enriched for processes thatare relevant to the phenotype of interest (e.g. SNPs associated with ASD and schizophrenia are enriched for cognition, associative and visual learning and regulation of nerve impulse in fetal brainand fetal spinal cord tissue). Taken together, our analysis pipeline offers a powerful resource to study three dimensional genome organization in a large number of cell lines and interpret the roleof regulatory variation in complex phenotypes.",2021,,S.

Yet different cell types in the body are able to develop because epigenetic marks, placed on top of the DNA, direct each cell type to read only speci ï¬c sections of the DNA. There are several types of epigenetic marks includingDNA methylation (DNAm), and histone modi ï¬cations. These marks orchestrate normal developmental processes via the expression of several hundred epigenes (genes that function in epigeneticregulation). Rapid advances in genomic research have led to the identi ï¬cation of over 60 epigenes which are associated with Mendelian disorders, many of which are characterized byovergrowth and dysregulation of neurodevelopment. We andothers have identi ï¬ed highly speci ï¬c and highly sensitive genome wide DNAm signatures for several of these epigenes including DNMT3A, NSD1, EZH2/EED, and CHD8; mutations inthese genes are associated with Tatton Brown Rahman, Sotos,Weaver, and Autism syndromes, respectively. These DNAm signatures can be used as a âsecond tier âanalysis to improve molecular diagnostics by classifying sequence variants of uncer tain signi ï¬cance (VUS) as either benign or pathogenic with efï¬cacy far superior to most in silico programs.

However, given the fact that DNAm signatures are still indevelopment, DNAm based disorder classi ï¬cation in this situation must be con ï¬rmed by sequencing to authenticate a molecular diagnosis.

Introduction: Deletion 1p36 (del1p36) syndrome is the most common human disorder resulting from a terminal autosomal deletion. This condition is molecularly and clinically heteroge neous. Deletions involving two non overlapping regions, knownas the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are suf ï¬cient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorph isms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region.25 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 â 87Materials and Methods: We used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to de ï¬ne a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that over lap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. Results: The clinical pro ï¬le of this disease includes develop mental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention de ï¬cit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrowpalate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especiallyin females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affectedfemales, providing further evidence of a speci ï¬c contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome speci ï¬c episignature that classi ï¬es syndromic traits. Conclusions: We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsuf ï¬ciency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric tothe previously established 1p36 critical regions.",2021,,F.

All tenindividuals had neurodevelopmental disorders including speech/ language delays ( N,10), intellectual disability ( N,8), epilepsy ( N ,6) and autism spectrum disorder ( N,4). Additional phenotypic features included abnormal growth parameters ( N,6), heart anomalies ( N,2) and hearing loss ( N,2). All six missense variants occurred in regions of the WDR5 locus known to be extremely intolerant to variation. Three dimensional structureanalyses indicate that all the residues affected by these variants are located at the surface of one side of the WDR5 protein. Five out of the six amino acid substitutions are predicted to disruptinteractions of WDR5 with RbBP5 and/or KMT2A/C, as part of theCOMPASS family complexes. Thus, we de ï¬ne a new neurodeve lopmental disorder associated with missense variants in WDR5 characterized by a broad range of associated features includingintellectual disability, speech/language impairments, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders.
