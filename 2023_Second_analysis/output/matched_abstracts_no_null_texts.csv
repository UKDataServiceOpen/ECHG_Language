59,Genetic defects in sterol metabolism,S60., F. MoebiusInstitute for Biochemical Pharmacology  University of Innsbruck  Innsbruck AustriaFabian.M,Genetic defects in sterol metabolizing enzymes have recently emerged asimportant causes of dysmorphogenetic syndromes. They affect enzymesrequired for the removal of methyl groups at C4(NSHDL)  the shift of the double bond from C8 9to C7 8(3ÃÂ§ sterol D 8 D7isomerase/EBP  E.C. 5.3.3.5) and the removal of the double bond at C7 8(D7 sterol reduc  tase/DHCR7  E.C. 1.3.1.21). Missense and nonsense mutations in NSHDL on Xq28 cause X chromosomal dominant CHILD syndrome (congenitalhemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects MIM308050)  a rare inborn disorder which affects bone and skin in femalesand is presumably lethal in males. NSHDL is involved in C4sterol demethylation but its precise biochemical function remains to be clarified.Nonsense and missense mutations in the same gene ( Nshdl ) underly the Bare patches and Striated mutations in mice. Recurrent missense andnonsense mutations in EBP (Emopamil binding protein) on Xp11.22 are found in patients with X chromosomal dominant chondrodysplasia puncta ta (Conradi H nermann syndrome  CDPX2  MIM302960). CDPX2 is char acterized by skeletal (epiphyseal stippling  limb shortening  short stature)and epidermal (atrophy  ichthyosis  hyperkeratosis) manifestations as wellas occasional sectorial cataracts. The mouse mutant Tattered carries amissense mutation in Ebp. The clinical differentiation between CHILD syn  drome and CDPX2 is controversial. The morphological phenotypes of Barepatches and Tattered are similar to each other and ressemble CHILD syn drome as well as CDPX2 including lethality in male embryos. Cholesterolcrossfeeding between cell patches in which either the X chromosome car rying the wildtype or the mutant allele are active possibly explains why nei ther in CHILD syndrome nor in CDPX2 total cholesterol levels are reduced.In contrast substantially reduced total sterol concentrations are a hallmarkof the more frequent autosomal recessive Smith Lemli Opitz/RSH syn drome (SLOS  MIM270400) due to mutations in DHCR7 in 11q13. SLOS is characterized by dysmorphogenesis (e.g. syndactyly  heart and lungdefects)  failure to thrive and mental retardation or autism. A recentlydescribed induced mouse mutant in Dhcr7 had the biochemical character Concurrent Symposia 75istics of the SLOS and most surprisingly symptoms of severe neurological deficits such as reduced physical activity and uncoordinated swallowing.Our work is supported by grants from the FWF and the sterreichischeNationalbank Concurrent Sessions ,2001.0,Fabian.Moebius@uibk.ac.at,,
150,Location of the first predisposing gene locus for Asperger syndrome on chromosome 1q21 22 ,C102., E. Jarvela1  T. Ylisaukko oja2  T. Nieminen3  E. Kempas1  M. Auranen1  L. Peltonen1 1National Public Health Institute  Helsinki  Finland  2National Public Health Insitute  Helsinki  Finland  3University of Helsinki  Dept of Child Neurology  Helsinki  F,Asperger syndrome (AS) was first described in 1944 by a Viennese physi cian Hans Asperger who reported a group of boys with autistic psychopa thy  whose clinical features resembled autism with some modifications. Itis characterised by difficulties in social interaction and stereotyped behav iour but in contrast to infantile autism by normal intelligence and usuallynormal language skills. In the pediatric age group the prevalence ofAsperger syndrome is around 4 7/1000 whereas the corresponding figurefor the infantile autism is 4/10000. Etiopathogenesis is unknown but thereis evidence for a strong genetic component. Based on clinical observationsAS is inherited in the same families as infantile autism but also as a sepa rate entity often transmitted from male to male. We report the analysis of13 candidate gene loci associated with autism and schizophrenia in 17Finnish AS families with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Linkageto the previously reported predisposing loci for autism could not be repli cated with Finnish AS families. By contrast  evidence for linkage wasobtained on 1q21 22 the region that has previously been linked to schizo phrenia (Brzustowicz et al.  2000) with the maximum two point lod score of2.70 with marker D1S484. Two families shared a common haplotype with in an 8.6 cM region between markers D1S2721 and D1S484. Our resultssuggest that AS and schizophrenia may have common genetic back ground. ,2001.0,irma.jarvela@hus.fi,,

Height  weight and head circumference were wellbelow the 3rd centile. The family history was inconspicuous. Cytogeneticanalyses demonstrated a derivative chromosome 5 with additional materi al of unknown origin in the distal long arm. FISH with a whole chromosomepaint / WCP 5 indicated a heterologous insertion of material within 5q3. Itsbanding pattern was inconclusive and did not allow identification of theinserted material. COBRA multi colour FISH with 24 WCPs pointed out achromosome 3 origin of the inserted material which was confirmed by FISHwith a WCP 3. Even with this information  the breakpoints of the aberrationcould not be determined upon re examination of GTG   CBG  and QFQ banded metaphases  Although a pericentromeric origin of the insertedmaterial could be excluded after CBG banding  its banding pattern fit nei ther the short nor the long arm of chromosome 3 exactly. To clarify the ori gin of the insertion  studies by 48 colour COBRA FISH are in progress.Using only 5 fluorophores  this novel technique achieves colour identifica tion of 48 different targets  in our case the differential labeling of all humanp and q arms by PQ COBRA FISH (Genome Res. 10 861 865). Results ofthe additional studies as well as a genotype phenotype correlation will bepresented. Supported by the DFG / Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ,2001.0,hengels@meb.uni,,

Olomouc  Czech R,Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive condi tion characterised by progressive microcephaly  early retardation ofgrowth  chromosomal instability  hypersensitivity to ionising radiation andimmunodeficiency predisposing to recurrent infections and malignancies inchildhood. We report a case of a newborn with some clinical features ofNBS and usefulness of combination of clinical examination  classical cyto genetics  FISH and molecular methods in establishing of correct diagnosis.The newborn is the 2nd child of young  healthy and genetic unrelated par ents. He is hypotrophic with unspecific somatic stigmatization  micro cephaly facial dysmorphism and heart abnormality (ASD). The karyotypeof the child was 46 XY  add(4)(q35) de novo with chromosomal breaks in4% of metaphases. We revealed the origin of additive material on 4q asdup(4)(q31.1qter) using the whole chromosome painting probe 4 andtelomere probe 4q combined with G banding technique. The translocationt(14q 21q) was also in 4 metaphases by FISH detected. The suspiciousclinical diagnosis of NBS was excluded because the deletion 657del5 inNBS1 gene on 8q21 was not detected. We compare the similarity of clini cal picture of our patient with cases with duplication of distal part 4qdescribed in the literature. ,2001.0,iveta.cernakova@hotmail.com,,
385,A case of pure partial trisomy of 5q34 qter associated with asthma  allergies and hyper IgE.,P0277., Demczuk1  B. Dion1  P. Lepage2  B. R. Hadad3  T. Hudson2  V. M.

Thus  one locus for asthma and allergic disease  a multifactorialtrait  has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5. We report on apatient with a partial trisomy of chromosome 5 and significant asthma andallergies. The patient presented  at 6 years of age  congenital heart disease (ASD  VSD  PDA)  developmental delay  severe eczema  asthma  numerous foodallergies and elevated serum IgE. The blood karyotype showed extramaterial on the short arm of chromosome 22. Spectral karyotyping (SKY)revealed that the extra material on chromosome 22 originated from chro mosome 5. FISH studies with BAC probes were undertaken to determinethe extent of chromosome 5 trisomy. BACs mapping to 5q34 and 5q35 allhybridized to the der(22). The child s karyotype is thus  46 XX der(22)t(? 22)(? p11.1). ish der(22)t(5 22)(q34 q11.1) (wcp5+  D22Z4+ D5S400+  D5S2006+). Parents karyotypes were normal.  The patient illustrates a case of pure partial trisomy of 5q34 5qter  as loss of 22p material is non significant. The distal 5q trisomy genotype has beenassociated with clinical signs that include growth and mental retardation eczema  craniofacial anomalies  and malformations of heart  lungs  andgenitalia  many of which our patient presents. The trisomic region does notinclude the chromosome 5 interval (5q31) linked to asthma and allergic dis ease. However  numerous genes potentially involved in heart development(hCsx  MSX2)  IgE levels (H2R) and asthma and allergic response (LCT4synthase  LCP2  H12 3) have been mapped to this chromosomal region. ,2001.0,suzanne.demczuk@muhc.mcgill.ca,,
443,Preliminary Findings In The Diagnostic Evaluation Of A Sample Of 103 Individuals With Pervasive DevelopmentDisorders,P0341., E. Steiner   M. M. Guerreiro  A. P. Marques de Faria Unicamp  Campinas  B,Pervasive development disorders (PDD) are a heterogeneous group ofneurobehavioral disorders of infancy. In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD  a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation  screening for inborn errors of metabolism  karyotypein folic acid deficient medium  and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation.Until now  the following conditions were detected  Down syndrome (n = 3) untreated phenylketonuria (n = 2)  Rett syndrome (n = 2)  tuberous sclero sis (n = 1)  fragile X syndrome (n = 1)  5 other dysmorphic conditions  2non genetic etiologies  and 2 individuals with chromosomal polymor phisms. Besides those  4 individuals presented no PDD and 3 individualshad infantile psychosis. These data suggest that  in at least 15% of thissample  a main etiologic factor could be identified. Although the diagnosisof a specific genetic condition do not modify the treatment of autistic indi viduals in most cases  it is of significant importance to the genetic coun seling of their relatives. For this reason  we reinforce the importance ofcareful dysmorphologic examination and complementary tests in any per son presenting with PDD  besides neurologic and psychiatric evaluation. ,2001.0,dgmfcm@unicamp.br,,
472,Laboratory Findings in a Male Patient with Suspected X Fragile Syndrome  Discovery of Mosaicism of Normal andMethylated FMR 1 Genes,P0371., Battaglia1  E. De Fanti1  R. Grimau Merino2  L. Giardina2  R. Schiavon1 1Laboratory of Clinical Pathology and Molecular Biology  Legnago Hospi  tal  Legnago (VR)  Italy  2Department of Pediatry  Legnago Hospital  Leg  nago (VR)  I,A 15 year old man with severe mental retardation   autism  hyperactivityand language deficit  was suspected to have X fragile syndrome. Thispatient and his family members were screened for FMR 1 gene mutationswith PCR technique and Southern blot hybridization using a FMR 1probe(pFxa1NHE ONCOR) . The PCR analysis failed to show any abnor mality of FMR 1 gene in all the subjects examined. The Southern Blotanalysis revealed the unusual presence of two alleles in a male patient  anormal allele (2.8 Kb) and a methylated allele corresponding to the normalallele present in females. This methylated allele is 5.2 Kb in size due to thepresence of a methylated site resistant to EagI restriction. We thereforehypothesize that a mosaicism of FMR 1 normal/FMR 1 methylated genealleles may lead to the development of X Fragile syndrome in this malepatient. Examination of family members demonstrated the presence of twonormal alleles in the proband s mother and a mutated allele in his grand mother .These findings may represent an atypical predisposition to FMR 1methylation. Since the FMR 1 full mutated allele found in the grandmotherwas not transmitted to her daughter  the proband s mother could inheritedthe normal X chromosome  followed by a de novo methylation mutation ofFMR 1 in the proband. The Southern Blot hybridization analysis revealeda FMR 1 mosaicism in the presence of a negative PCR study. It is there fore mandatory to employ the hybridation technique in the setting of strongclinical suspicion of FRAXA alteration even when initial PCR screening isnegative. ,2001.0,de_fanti_emanuela@hotmail.com,,
473,Detection of subtelomeric rearrangements by FISH in patients with idiopathic mental retardation or autism.,P0372., Ostergaard   J. M. Hahnemann  H. Hjalgrim  K. Nielsen  H. M. Nielsen  K. Brondum NielsenJohn F. Kennedy Institute  Glostrup  D,The subtelomeric regions are often involved in chromosomal rearrange 172 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyments. They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients  all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated  One group consisted of 14 patients with autism  andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found  A 1pter deletion  resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR  growth retardation  and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR  epilepsy microcephaly  and dysmorphism  consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR  microcephaly  an atrial septum defect  and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients.In conclusion three out of 41 (7.3%) patients with idiopathic MR were foundto have subtelomeric rearrangements  in concordance with the prevalence(5 10%) in previous studies. ,2001.0,els@kennedy.dk,,
519,No evidence for mutations in the HLXB9 gene in the DNA of patients with anal sphincter dysplasia,P0420., Hergersberg1  J. Hirsig2  A. Buchmann3  V. Schneider1  A. Schinzel1  B. R thlisberger1 1Institut f r Medizinische Genetik  Z rich  Switzerland  2Kantonsspital  Winterthur  Switzerland  3Stadtspital W aid  Z rich  Switzerland ,Anal sphincter dysplasia (ASDP) has been described as anteriorly or ven trally displaced anus (OMIM 105563). Absent or incomplete fixation of thesphincter to the coccyx are demonstratable by computer tomography aswell as by intraoperative dissection of the sphincter muscles. The range ofsymptoms included chronic constipation  severe straining at defecation encopresis  and chronic paradoxical diarrhea with fecal incontinence. Thiscongenital malformation occurs often familial  and an autosomal dominantmode of inheritance with reduced penetrance has been suggested.Recently  mutations in the HLXB9 homeobox gene have been described inthe DNA of patients with Currarino syndrome  an autosomal dominantinherited form of sacral agenesis. Because anorectal malformations are acomponent of the Currarino syndrome  the HLXB9 gene was analyzed inthe DNA of 20 probands affected from ASDP with several affected familymembers. The three exons of the HLXB9 gene were amplified using ninedifferent primer pairs  and the PCR products were analyzed by singlestrand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. There was no evi dence for mutations in this gene in the analyzed DNA samples. ,2001.0,hergie@medgen.unizh.ch,,

This is due to an abnormalexpanded GCC repeat  adjacent to a methylated CpG island proximal tothe FMR2 gene. As part of a routine diagnosis  all individuals referred to usfor Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) study  and tested FRAXA negative  werestudied for FRAXE mutation. Among 485 index case patients  2 were iden tified with the FRAXE full mutation  both with cytogenetic expression of thefragile site (29 and 23% respectively) and with no history of mental retar dation. One of them has an autistic disorder with severe MR an a dysmor phic face similar to FXS. The second one is a nearly normal man with nor mal phenotype but who had learning difficulties at school when he was achild. Their families were also studied  with a total of 16 members at risktested. We found 6 of them normal (3 men and 3 women) and 10 carrierwomen (4 premutated and 6 fully mutated). None of these women presentany type of mental impairment. The last sample studied was a fully mutat ed female foetus that was spontaneously aborted after obtaining chorionicvilli for prenatal diagnosis. Although the GCC expansion was greater than0.8 kb  it was unmethylated in the majority of the tissues studied by us. So even though molecular study of FRAXE mutation is now available  furtherstudies are nedeed for the purpose of genetic counselling and prenataldiagnosis. ,2001.0,itejada@hbas.osakidetza.net,,

Yaron1 1Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center  Tel Aviv  Israel  2Sheba Medical Cen  ter  Ramat Gan  Israel  3UCLA School of Medicine  Los Angeles  CA Unit  ed States  4Meir General Hospital  Kfar Saba  Israel ,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized bycognitive and adaptive regression with autistic features  loss of acquiredskills like speech and hand usage  stereotypic hand movements  epilepsy ataxia and deceleration of head growth that almost exclusively affectsfemales. Even before the causative gene for this syndrome was identified  pedigree studies indicated that it was likely to be an X linked dominantdisorder  with presumed lethality in males. Nonetheless  there were a fewdescriptions of males suspected of having Rett syndrome. These includesporadic cases meeting the clinical inclusion criteria  sporadic males withKlinefelter syndrome (47 XXY)  and males with severe neonatalencephalopathy in known Rett syndrome families. With the recent discov ery that the MECP2 gene on Xq28 is the gene responsible for most casesof Rett syndrome  it is possible to molecularly assess cases suspected ofhaving male Rett syndrome by direct sequencing analysis. We describethe first 4 cases of molecularly confirmed cases of Rett syndrome in Israel.One of the families presented here consists of a female having classicalRett syndrome and a male sibling with severe neonatal encephalopathy.Molecular analysis revealed that both sister and brother have the sameMECP2 gene mutation  however their mother does not  suggestinggermline mosaicism. The case emphasizes the point that maternalgermline mosaicism may lead to affected female or male offspring  whichshould be taken into consideration during genetic counseling regardingrecurrence risks  and suggests that prenatal diagnosis may be warrantedin siblings of apparently sporadic cases of Rett syndrome. It also highlightsthe importance of molecular diagnosis in every case of idiopathic neonatalencephalopathy in males. ,2001.0,aviorr@tasmc.health.gov.il,,

Clas sical RS features seem to occur almost exclusively in females  with an esti mated prevalence of one in 10 000 15 000 female birth. The vast majori ties of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin  and are due to de novomutations. Mutations in the Methyl CpG Binding protein 2 gene have been identified in roughly 75 % of classical Rett girls. We collected DNA samplesfrom 42 Italian classical Rett girls  and screened the MECP2 coding regionfor mutations by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography(DHPLC)  and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently devel oped method for mutation screening combining high sensitivity  reducedcost per run and high throughput. In our study  16 different de novoMECP2 mutations  seven of which were previously unreported  were foundin 32/42 Rett girls (76%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized ina total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identifi cation of 14/16 different mutations (87%)  after optimal conditions wereestablished  this figure increased to 100%  with all recurrent MECP2 muta tions generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Standardizationof DHPLC reagents and methods seems to be critical to the reliability andaccuracy of mutation prediction. Detailed analysis of signature shape retention time  and retention time differences between peaks will allow sig nature based sequence identification  at least for the most commonMECP2 mutations and SNPs. ,2001.0,talycarella@tigem.it,,
1164,Towards the understanding of the lysosomal transport disorders  proteomic maps of lysosomal membrane proteins.,P1179., V. Pshezhetsky   V. Seyrantepe  J. Ausseil  K. Landry  Y. Chang Sainte Justine Hospital  Montreal  C,Lysosomal membrane transport proteins mediate the traffic of protons cysteine or activated acetyl residues into the lysosome and the catabolicproducts such as amino acids  monosaccharides and vitamins out of thelysosome. Lack or malfunction of lysosomal transporter proteins causesseveral severe genetic diseases of children including nephropathic cysti nosis CTNS)  Niemann Pick disease type C  sialic acid storage disease(SIASD)  cobalamin (cbl) F disease  mucolipidosis IV (ML IV) and Sanfilip po III type C (MPS IIIC). The goal of our proteomic based research pro gram is to identify the underlying cause of genetic diseases  as reflectedby the protein patterns of affected cells and tissues. We have isolated lyso somal membranes from mouse and human liver  obtained their proteomicmaps using two dimensional gel electrophoresis with immobilized pH gra dients and identified the major proteins by combining peptide mass finger printing  and amino acid sequencing. The obtained results have providedthe basis to build a complete proteomic database of the lysosomal mem brane. Then we have analyzed lysosomal membrane proteins from cul tured skin fibroblasts of normal controls and patients suffering from cbl Fand MPS IIIC and identified the protein spots that reproducibly differbetween patients and control cells. Candidate disease causing genes willbe cloned  and studied by mutation analysis and/or by expression andfunctional characterization. This approach may be in the future extended todiscovery of other disease related membrane proteins in peroxisomes microsomes  mitochondria and the plasma membranes. ,2001.0,anadaalex@justine.umontreal.ca,,
1198,Investigation of inborn errors of purine and pyrimidine metabolism,P1216., Giguere   D. Cyr  C. Auray Blais  B. Lemieux Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke  Sherbrooke  PQ C,In the last decade  there have been many exciting developments in thefield of inborn errors of purine and pyrimidine metabolism. These disordersshould be suspected in any case of unexplained anaemia  failure to thrive susceptibility to recurrent infection or neurological deficits with no currentdiagnosis  including autism  cerebral palsy  developmental delay  deaf ness  epilepsy  self mutilation  muscle weakness  inability to walk or talk gout and sometimes renal disease. The diagnosis of the majority of theknown inherited defects of purine and pyrimidine metabolism can beachieved by the analysis of urinary excretion profiles by reversed phasehigh performance liquid chromatography and multi wavelengh UV detec tion. Once perfected  this technique has important clinical applications forhigh risk screening and follow up. We have established control values forsixteen different metabolites  thus permitting the possibility of diagnosingthirteen different diseases. Since the beginning of our analyses (October1998)  we have found seven positive cases  one molybdenum cofactordeficiency  one dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency and five ade nine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency.

An open bank of anonymously col lected materials documented by a detailed clinical diagnosis forms thebasis of this growing database of information about the disease. Three cri teria were used to assess the autistic phenotype. These include the ADI(Autism Diagnostic Interview)  the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation al Schedule Generic)  and the DSM IV Diagnostic Criteria for 299.00 Autis tic Disorder. All clinical interviews were conducted face to face. For eachdonor subject tested  a representative Autistic Diagnostic Criteria ScoreSheet used to collect data is provided. Currently  the resource contains 20families in which 41 individuals have been examined. Thirty three of theseindividuals have a diagnosis of autistic disorder by two or more criteria  28of these satisfy all three criteria. There are 20 affected sib pairs with a diag nosis of autistic disorder by two or more criteria  9 of these pairs meet thecriteria for autistic disorder by all three criteria.

Evidence for a strong genetic basis forthe disorder stems from twin studies and the increased rate of autism insiblings of autistic probands compared to the population prevalence.IMGSAC have previously published a whole genome screen for 36 sib pairs  with a subset of 175 markers typed in a further 49 sib pairs and 3sibling trios. Five regions were identified with multipoint Maximum LodScore (MLS) > 1 (chromosomes 4  7  10  16 and 22). These regions havebeen characterised further and the results are presented here along withnew findings. A whole genome screen has now been carried out for 86 sib pairs using 394 microsatellites.

Fluo rescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis with chromosome 7q specificYAC clones showed that the chromosome 7 breakpoint is located betweenmarkers D7S684 and D7S661. The region coincides with the candidateregion for autism on chromosome 7 from previous linkage studies. A BACclone of 82 kb spanning the translocation breakpoint was identified  andthe breakpoint was mapped to 2 kb region within the BAC. Mutationscreening of the 2 genes closest to the breakpoint was performed in a setof 30 autistic patients. We found no sequence variant which predictsaminoacid alteration associated with the phenotype. Two polymorphicnucleotides were identified in one of the genes  and the significance of thepolymorphism in autism remains to be clarified.

The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex  probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest  defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line.

Rett Disorder (RD) is also a PDD with unique clini cal features including microcephaly and loss of purposeful hand move ments followed by development of stereotyped  repetitive hand move ments. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause RD. Because of the pheno typic similarity between RD and AD  we screened 69 females in familiesascertained for AD gene mapping studies. Patients had a clinical diagno sis of AD  confirmed using the ADI R. Patients with RD features such asmicrocephaly were excluded. Patients were screened using DHPLC todetect variants followed by sequencing. Two were found to have mutationsin the MECP2 gene. Patient one (age 10 years) developed normally untilage 30 months when she regressed in language and motor skills. Head cir cumference is at the 25th percentile. She did not lose purposeful handmovements and never developed RD stereotyped hand movements.

However mutations in theCSX/Nkx2 5 gene encoding a cardiac specific homeobox transcription fac tor have been reported to cause atrial septal defects (ASD) associated withatrioventricular (AV) conduction block. The CSX gene is expressed in car diac muscle during embryonic  fetal and adult life  and its Drosophilaortholog tinman  is essential for the formation of the dorsal vessel.

Mutations of the TBX5 gene cause thiscondition. Intrafamilial phenotypic variability is well documented  but etiol ogy is clear. Here  we report on a set of monozygotic (MZ) twins with HoltÃ¢\x80\x94Oram syndrome. Monozygosity was confirmed by DNA microsatelliteanalysis. Both twins carried a one basepair de novo deletion mutation inTBX5  which leads to a frameshift and predicts a premature termination ofTBX5 protein. The twins shared concordant and complex cardiac defectsincluding secundum ASD  a large membranous VSD  multiple musculardefects  pulmonic narrowing and mild tricuspid regurgitation. However their limb defects are discordant. Skeletal X rays show one twin hasabsence of thumbs bilaterally  hypoplastic radial bones and hooked clavi cles and a bifid rib. The other twin has similar anomalies on her right  buta thumb is present on the left  though distal metacarpal and phalanx arehypoplastic. This genotype phenotype disparity suggests that the geneticbackground might play a important role in the intrafamilial cardiac pheno typic variability observed in Holt Oram syndrome. Factors other thangenetic background such as blood supply or the position of fetus in uterusmay also contribute to limb anomalies. Here we propose a monoallelicexpression model to explain the discordance. ,2001.0,tatesthuang@rascal.med.harvard.edu,,

23,The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families. Four regions of linkage were identifi ed  including chromosome 2q (MLS 3.74), 7q (MLS 3.20), 16p (MLS  2.93) and 17q (MLS 2.34), three of which have been replicated by  other groups. Candidate gene and association studies are now in  progress in order to isolate the susceptibility genes at these loci.  On chromosome 7q31, the FOXP2 gene is mutated in a severe  monogenic form of speech and language impairment and encodes a  transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead  domain. FOXP2 was tested for association and mutation in both  complex language impairments and autism. No association or coding  region variants in FOXP2 were found and the gene is therefore  unlikely to play a major role in autism or more common forms of  language impairment.",2002.0,,"Monaco1, IMGSAC2, SLIC3","1Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford,  Oxford, United Kingdom, 2The International Molecular Genetic Study  of Autism Consortium (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~maestrin/iat.html),  United Kingdom, 3The Specific Language Impairment Consortium  (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/monaco/dianne/index.shtml), United  Kingdom."

PDD  affect around 1:2500 individuals within the first three years of life with  a sex ratio M:F = 4:1. A strong genetic basis has been recognized and several genomic  studies, as well as cytogenetic observations, have identified at least  12 candidate loci for genes predisposing to PDD. Among these  regions, 15q11 q13, 7q31 and, recently, 22q13, have been most  frequently reported in association with PDD. In order to identify the prevalence of 22q13 rearrangements  (deletions) in PDD we have genotyped, by microsatellite markers  analysis, 110 patients selected through a collaboration with various  italian Child Neuropsychiatry centers. We detected a deletion at the  D22S1169 locus in two patients (one paternally and one maternally  derived) and a maternally derived deletion at the D22S1170 locus  in a third patient. These patients presented with an Angelman like  phenotype, characterized by hypotonia, developmental delay and  absent speech. However, they did not show epilepsy. Although  the pathogenicity of these rearrangements needs to be confirmed  by further studies, our results suggest that deletions within the  22q13 region might play a role in determining PDD in 2.7% of  patients. Considering the marked genetic heterogeneity of PDD, this  percentage appears to be relatively high.",2002.0,,"Gurrieri , L. Russo, T. Giordano, E. De Vincenzi, G.

123,Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Case Study Using  High Resolution Microarray Based CGH,P0027.,,"Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test  and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and  analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose.  Control hybridizations with normal male to male, male to female and  female to female reference samples were performed and showed  the expected results.

876,Mapping of a Candidate Region for Autism on  Chromosome 2q32.,P0787.,,"Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism,  who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of  chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This  would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of  chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing  gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers  from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This  reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7  megabases. The region contains approximately 16 known genes and  16 ESTs, a number of which are potential candidates for autism.

1167,Risk of sex chromosome mosaicism associated  with Y chromosome AZFc microdeletions,P1081.,,"Deletions of specific Y chromosome regions cause male infertility.  Recent advances in infertility treatment permits deleted Y  chromosomes to be transmitted to male offspring with the assumption  that there will be no clinical consequences other than infertility in adult  life. Recent data suggested that sex chromosome mosaicism could  arise when AZFc deleted Y chromosomes are transmitted from one  generation to another by ICSI. If this hypothesis is correct, it raises  the possibility that some patients with 45,X/46,XY karyotypes, such Posters   Y chromosome, Infertility304 305 as patients with Turner related phenotypes or sexual ambiguities may  in fact harbour Y chromosome microdeletions. To test this hypothesis,  we screened a group of patients with a 45,X/46,XY karyotype for Y  microdeletions using several Y specific markers. We show that 33%  of patients presenting with Turner stigmata and/or sexual ambiguities  and a 45,X/46,XY karyotype, carried Y chromosome microdeletions  of distal Yq. These results highlight a potential risk for offspring born  to fathers carrying Y chromosome microdeletions and treated by  assisted reproductive techniques. The risk is the development of sex  chromosome aneuploidy during foetal and embryonic development.  The clinical consequences of this can be severe, including Turner  syndrome, mixed gonadal dysgenesis, male pseudohermaphroditism  and rarely mild mental retardation or autism. Our data may also  explain in part the observation that in almost three quarters of all 45,X  patients with Turner syndrome, the X chromosome is maternal in  origin. Concluding, the transmission of Y chromosome microdeletions  could potentially have more severe clinical consequences other than  male infertility, such as the development of sexual ambiguities and/or  Turner stigmata.",2002.0,,"C.

42,A mixed epigenetic genetic environmental model for  autism with a principal imprinted gene in chromosome  15q11 q13,C05.,,"We define epigenetic disease as an abnormal phenotype caused  by altered gene expression in the absence of nucleotide sequence  variation. There is evidence that maternal but not paternal  duplications of chromosome 15q11 q13 can cause autism. The  Angelman gene ( UBE3A ) maps in 15q and is imprinted with  paternal silencing in brain. Based in part on the duplication data,  we hypothesize that over expression of UBE3A  is the major cause  of autism, perhaps most commonly through brain specific failure of  paternal silencing. Using the AGRE and NIMH/Stanford sib pairs, we  found evidence for increased sharing of paternal alleles in 15q11 q13,  with the greatest sharing centromeric to the imprinting center (IC)  at D15S817 ; sharing was greater for the 77 AGRE than for the 56  NIMH sib pairs with a Chi square of 5.48 ( P = 0.02) for the combined  data. We propose that autism may be caused in the majority of cases  by epigenetic imprinting defects arising on normal or particularly  susceptible paternal 15q chromosomes during spermatogenesis or  after fertilization, but before the time of MZ twining, leading to brain  specific over expression of UBE3A . Rather than the widely accepted  multilocus model for autism, we propose a mixed epigenetic genetic  environmental model with a principal imprinted gene in chromosome  15q. A combination of de novo and inherited contributions could  explain why concordance for autism is high in MZ but low in DZ  twins. Evidence will be presented for an epigenetic modifier locus for  autism. A mixed epigenetic genetic model may be relevant to other  complex disease traits.Concurrent Sessions48 49",2003.0,,"L.

322,Transcriptional profiling in Rett syndrome using  spotted cDNA microarrays.,P231.,,"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder affecting  exclusively females. Its prevalence is about 1 in 15,000 live borns  and it accounts for approximately 10% of severe mental retardation  in women. The clinical course of the disease is typical and consists  of a normal neonatal period followed by an arrest of the development  between 6 and 18 months of age. The patients show a number of  clinical signs indicative of a neurodevelopmental defect : arrest of  brain development, regression of acquisitions, and behavioural  troubles (stereotypic hand movement, autism). Mutations in the MeCP2 gene were identified in 70 80% of Rett  syndrome cases. The MeCP2 gene encodes a methyl CpG  binding protein that is expressed ubiquitously and acts as a global  transcriptional repressor through its interaction with mSin3A. Defects  in MECP2 function are thus expected to lead to the abnormal  transcription of a number of currently unidentified genes. To test this  hypothesis, we have performed global expression analysis using  cDNA microarrays. We have compared the expression level of 12.000  non redondant cDNAs and EST in five RTT lymphoblastoid cell  lines (mutations R168X, R255X, R270X, R294X and 608insA) and  two clonal cell lines expressing only the MeCP2 transcripts with the  R106W and R194X mutations. Several genes show a significantly  different expression level in RTT samples when compared to wild  type lymphoblastoid cell lines. These results are being confirmed by  Northern Blot analysis and we expect to identify a subset of genes  that are (directly or indirectly) regulated by the MeCP2 protein.",2003.0,,"Saywell1, M.

328,Rett patients with both MECP2 mutation and 15q11  13 rearrangments.,P237.,,"Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism (A) are classified as separate  disorders. Recently, the identification of the Preserved Speech  Variant (PSV), where autistic behavior is usual, stressed the  phenotypic overlap between these two conditions. In 1999 it was  shown that about 80% of RTT cases have a de novo  mutation in  the transcriptional silencer MECP2  gene, classifying RTT as a  monogenic X L dominant disorder. Subsequently, we and others  provided evidence that this model was too simple and not sufficient  to explain why germline MECP2  mutations may result in X L mental  retardation in males while they may be silent in carrier females. On  the other hand, we and others have provided evidence that 15q11  q13 maternally inherited duplications are found in autistic children,  suggesting that an abnormal dosage of gene(s) within this region  might be responsible for A. Now we show that a proportion of RTT  patients are carriers of both a MECP2  mutation and a 15q11 q13  duplication and that other RTT patients are carriers of a MECP2   mutation and a 15q11 q13 duplication. Therefore, we hypothesize  a complex model in which a MECP2  mutation is necessary but not  sufficient to cause the RTT phenotype in females, based on the  status of a second gene which, at least in a proportion of cases, may  be abnormal dosage of one or more 15q11 q13 gene. In summary,  we provide preliminary evidence that A and RTT (clinically related for  a long time) may have a common overlapping molecular basis.",2003.0,,"Renieri1, I. Longo1, F. Ariani1, I.

361,Rapid high resolution dosage analysis and  refinement of 2q37 deletion breakpoints using multiplex  amplifiable probe hybridization.,P270.,,"Deletion of 2q37.3, the telomeric region of chromosome 2q, is  associated with an Albright hereditary osteodystrophy like syndrome.  It is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, facial  dysmorphism and shortening of the metacarpals and metatarsals.  Additional features may include obesity, short stature, strabismus,  eczema, sparse or coarse hair and autism or other behavioral  disturbances. The deletions have traditionally been studied by  conventional cytogenetics, FISH and microsatellite analysis, but  these methods offer limited resolution. To better define the commonly  deleted region, we have developed new assays for systematic  assessment of gene dosage across the 2q37.3 region by multiplex  amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH) and quantitative real time  PCR (Q PCR). The MAPH assay covers 20 known genes and 5  microsatellite loci from 2q37, together with 8 control loci, in two  hybridizations. Selected genes were also analyzed by Q PCR. Known  deletion and deletion/duplication patients were used as controls  for verification. Previous microsatellite results were confirmed in all  cases. Furthermore, significant refinement of the proximal breakpoint  was achieved in one deletion patient. We have subsequently used  MAPH to exclude major deletion in another patient with an AHO  like phenotype in whom multiple microsatellites were uninformative.  MAPH therefore offers a rapid means of high resolution dosage  analysis across the 2q37.3 region and represents a significant  improvement over current diagnostic methods. Analysis of a wider  panel of patients is ongoing to further narrow the commonly deleted  region and to search for microdeletions that might pinpoint the  candidate gene(s) responsible for this phenotype.Cytogenetics120 121",2003.0,,"A.

Most NS and ML/ LS patients harbour mutations in the PTPN11  gene. We investigated  PTPN11  gene mutations in NS and ML/LS syndrome patients, and  analysed genotype phenotype correlations, with major emphasis on  the association between distinct PTPN11  mutations and different  CHD. Seventy NS and 13 ML/LS patients including 72 with CHD  were enrolled in this study. PTPN11  gene mutation screening was  performed by SSCP analysis. Fourteen different  PTPN11  mutations were detected in 22 NS and  11 ML/LS patients. Eighty six percent of NS and 67% of ML/LS  patients with PTPN11  mutations were affected by different types  of CHD. Prevalence of CHD was remarkably different between the  two phenotypes. In particular, pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) was  the predominant CHD among NS patients with mutations, with a  significant hot spot in exon 8, while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM) was more frequent among ML/LS patients, with hot spots  in exons 7 and 12. Atrial septal defect (ASD) was correlated with  mutations in exon 3, while atrioventricular canal defects and mitral  valve anomalies were detected in different PTPN11  gene domains.  The present study argues for a causal relationship between PTPN11   mutations and a wide spectrum of heart defects. PVS, ASD and HCM  are likely to occur in association with specific exon mutations, with a  different distribution between NS and ML/LS patients.This work was  supported by the Italian Ministry of Health and EducationP821.

Affected children exhibit consistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) of uncertain origin. There are no other laboratory Ã¯Â¬Ândings of note and no evidence of any abnormality of bone or liver metabolism, or altered skeletal architecture. Affected siblings and/or consanguinity suggest autosomal recessive inheritance, but the underlying pathogenesis is  unknown.We describe a new case and review the clinical features in the context of 16 previously reported children. Our proband is a 5ÃÂ½ yr old girl born to consanguineous parents, who presented with marked developmental delay and dysmorphic features (brachycephaly, coarse facies, hypertelorism, bulbous nose with prominent nasal bridge, and downturned corners of the mouth) at Ã¯Â¬Âve months of age. Subsequently, failure to thrive, acquired microcephaly, and autistic behaviours were observed. Seizures and an abnormal EEG were also seen. The hyperphosphatasia (867ÃÂ±72 IU/L, n=7) is associated with decreased pyridoxal 5Ã¢ÂÂ phosphate (B 6), and the question of aberrant vitamin  B6 metabolism has been raised in this condition before. Pyridoxine  challenge (100 mg bolus) resulted in normalized EEG activity. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs tonic clonic and absence seizures have not been evident since phenobarbital withdrawal and treatment with 100 mg pyridoxine daily. Our case illustrates two points: 1) alkaline phosphatase should be assayed in children presenting with similar Ã¯Â¬Ândings; 2) pyridoxine EEG challenge should be attempted to determine whether other affected children show pyridoxine responsiveness.",2005.0,,"M.

Previously,  VCX  A (variably charged protein X A), located at Xp22.3, was introduced as a gene for mental retardation and its presence was suggested to be sufÃ¯Â¬Âcient to maintain normal mental development. Recent reports suggest that mutations in  NLGN4 (neuroligin 4), located at that same  region, are involved in autistic disorders and mental retardation.In the current study we describe a pedigree of 3 generations affected by contiguous gene syndrome that includes the clinical features of X linked ichthyosis and Kallmann syndrome.

His world remains limited to a biunivocal relation with the mother, that lasts longer than the other children, so remaining in a condition of passivity and greatest dependence. He understands he doesnÃ¢ÂÂt overtake the daily problems without help. He reacts isolating from the real life, taking refuge in a fantastic world. He closes himself in a autistic passivity as the only answer to his own inadequacy. The world outside seems to him full of hostility.More than ten years ago we chose, in favour of patients with genetic syndromes, a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a clinical genetist. Therapeutical results have been  satisfactory in KBG patients.We noted: acceptance of their own body, more optimistic approach to life, improvement of school and working integration, higher control of  nutritional and drug addiction.This experience improved our life and our profession, allowing a deep and empathyc interaction between patient and physician, that  represents the true essence of every medical act.",2005.0,,"Biondi , D.

One of the genes associated with CHD is the  NKX2 5 gene, which encodes a  cardiac homeobox transcription factor. Mutations of NKX2 5, which  is located at 5q35.1 have been identiÃ¯Â¬Âed in a subset of familial and sporadic cases of atrioventricular (AV) conduction block associated with a spectrum of structural heart defects, including atrial septal defect (ASD) and tetratology of Fallot. Functional studies of  NKX2  5 mutations have indicated that haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency determines the AV conduction block and ASD phenotypes. However, some studies suggest dominant negative effects and it has not been possible to correlate other  NKX2 5 phenotypes with a speciÃ¯Â¬Âc mechanism of the  mutation due to a small sample size.Here, we present delineation of a microdeletion in a patient with AV conduction block, ASD and tricuspid valve malformation (Ebstein anomaly) in addition to microcephaly, scoliosis and pectoral hypoplasia. FISH mapping of an apparently balanced inversion, 46, XY, inv(5)(q13q35) de novo, revealed a 2.2 megabase deletion  at the distal inversion breakpoint. This region contains 17 RefSeq genes, including  NKX2 5. This case gives therefore strong evidence  for haploinsufÃ¯Â¬Âciency of NKX2 5 as the cause of Ebstein anomaly.

The identiÃ¯Â¬Âcation of genes involved in autism is expected to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder. We initiated a positional cloning strategy, starting from four unrelated persons with idiopathic, non familial autism carrying a  de  novo  chromosomal aberration. Last year, we reported on the identiÃ¯Â¬Âcation of three different genes affected by the characterized translocations:  Neurobeachin  (NBEA ),  CLIC4 (chloride intracellular channel protein) and amisyn. Recently, the  C10orf74  gene was found to be affected by the paracentric inversion  present in the fourth patient. This gene encodes for a predicted protein with high homology to proteins in human and several other species, most of which have not been characterized yet. The best characterized homolog is yeast Yop1p, which interacts with the yeast Rab GTPase Ypt1p required for vesicular ER to Golgi transport.The involvement of these genes in the regulated secretory pathway of LDCVs is currently under study by means of RNAi mediated gene knockdown in the ÃÂ²TC3 neuroendocrine cell line. For neurobeachin and amisyn, we showed that disruption of gene expression results in a signiÃ¯Â¬Âcant increase of regulated secretion, suggesting a role for both proteins as negative regulators of vesicle trafÃ¯Â¬Âcking and/or fusion. Similarly, overexpression of Yop1p (C10orf74 yeast ortholog) has been reported to block ER to Golgi membrane trafÃ¯Â¬Âcking.In conclusion, these data suggest a role for NBEA, amisyn and C10orf74 as negative regulators of neuron vesicle trafÃ¯Â¬Âcking.

Detailed results of this  ongoing study will be presented.Conclusion: subtelomeric MLPA screening can be done without preselection, and appears to be cost effective, time saving, and clinically rewarding, as some of the positive patients would not have been selected on clinical grounds for multiFISH.

1285,Familial secundum atrial septal defect maps to  chromosome 15,P1172.,,"Atrial septum defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart defect affecting  4 in 100,000 individuals. ASD of the secundum type is characterised by an incomplete coverage of the ostium secundum resulting in a left to right shunting. The effects of the ASD range from subclinical to severe symptoms including pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias and heart failure. ASD is mostly sporadic but several familial cases have been reported. We describe two extended Swedish families with isolated autosomal dominant ASD. Using polymorphic microsatellite markers, we performed a genome wide scan in search for chromosomal regions linked to ASD. Linkage to the previously described candidate loci including the  COMP and GATA4 genes were excluded for the two  families. We identiÃ¯Â¬Âed a 23 cM region on chromosome 15 (15p11 q13) which is linked to the disease phenotype. The region is restricted by recombination events between the markers D15S165 and D15S659 and we calculated a maximum cumulative LOD score for the two families of 3.6 assuming full penetrance. Candidate genes are now investigated in the linked region for structural mutations from affected  family members.",2005.0,,Matsson,"Uppsala university, Uppsala, Sweden"
1338,BARCODE: a new software for comparative dating of  haplotypic nested lineages,P1225.,,"We present a new software for comparative dating estimates of haplotypic lineages deÃ¯Â¬Âned by Unique Event Polymorphisms (UEP), on the basis of linked STR diversity. BARCODE (Basic ASD Regression for COmparative Dating Estimates), applies a comparative dating approach free of assumptions on STR mutation rates to detect the linear accumulation of ASD over time. Its power relies on the exploitation of the UEP deÃ¯Â¬Âned phylogeny, which provides a unique solution for the order of nodes in the tree to be analysed. The set of possible solutions to be tested for ASD TIME linearity is created through an algorithm speciÃ¯Â¬Âcally created. The more the phylogeny has a nested shape, the more the dating result is robust. BARCODE allows to weight each lineage according to its frequency in the dataset, a fundamental option Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology348 when the sampled lineages include variants supposed to be ancestral  to a demographic expansion or when dealing with data unbalanced in  sample size.We report the results obtained by running BARCODE on published Y chromosomal data sets. The relative dating estimates are in general agreement with the absolute estimates originally published. The results also allow inferences on STR mutation rates (ASD TIME regression slopes): some critical loci emerged, which show variable mutation patterns across the data sets. However, most STR loci show a similar behaviour across the data sets, thus conÃ¯Â¬Ârming their informativeness. The most commonly used STR loci can then be ranked in different classes, according to their mutation rates, independently on the  particular data set considered.Work supported by PRIN MIUR 2003.",2005.0,,"Luca1, M.

1427,Microrrearrangements of human chromosome 15q11 q13  in families with autistic disorder,P1315.,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting complex genetic etiology. Human chromosome 15q11 q13 is a candidate region to autism based on linkage, linkage disequilibrium, cytogenetic abnormalities, and maternal duplications at this locus in patients with autism and autism related phenotype. Chromosome 15q11 q13 contains several imprinted genes expressed in the brain, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, and is rich in segmental duplications. These sequences promote fairly frequent 15q11 q13 rearrangements resulting in Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, mental retardation and autism spectrum disorder. Among plausible candidate genes for autism in this region is the cluster of the gamma aminobutiric acid (GABA) receptor genes. In order to detect possible duplicon mediated submicroscopic rearrangements of 15q11 q13, we have performed the analysis of microsatellite markers in Spanish autistic families, and multiplex families of autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and control samples. We have found frequent microduplications at 15q11.2 region and at GABA locus Genomics, technology, gene function, bioinformatics367 in autistic patients and control samples. Two patients have a paternally  inherited microduplication between the genes GABRA5 and GABRG3 whereas other two patients have a maternally inherited duplication within the D15S1021 marker. All the other duplications are the novo microrearrangements. Using quantitative PCR, PFGE, additional microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the region we are currently deÃ¯Â¬Âning the size of these rearrangements, which should help to delineate the relationship between 15q11 q13 alterations and autistic disorder.",2005.0,,"Cerrato , M.

1486,Inheritance Pattern in Congenital Heart Disease,P1374.,,"Background: About 0.8% of live births are complicated by  cardiovascular malformations. Most of these anomalies appear to have a multifactorial or polygenic etiology. About 5 7%of cardiovascular malformations result from a chromosomal defect and about 3% of them has a single gene disorder. The aim of this study is to determine genetic patterns inÃ¯Â¬Âuencing congenital heart disease (CHD).Materials & Methods: We studied 203 consecutive patients suffered from CHD being referred to cardiovascular research center during 10 months. Familial pedigree, Clinical and paraclinical data of patients  were evaluated. Results: There were 90 male and 113 female in this study (mean age = 5.48).The most common malformations were VSD (19.2%), ASD (11.8%), PDA (11.2%) and TOF (10.3%). Of these patients, 70 patients had a positive familiar pedigree with CHD. About 71% were born from consanguineous marriage of different degrees (76% third degree). In 67%of cases at least one more relatives had the same problem while in one family another 4 relatives found to have CHD. The highest inbreeding coefÃ¯Â¬Âcient (13.28) was found in one family and 39.9% had 6.25=<F. The inheritance pattern in this patients included Autosomal Dominant (5.7%), Autosomal Recessive (5.7%), Sex Linked (2.9%)  and positive pedigree without inheritance pattern (86%).

13,Identification and Functional Analysis of CITED2 Mutations in Patients with congenital Heart Defects,C32.,,"We present for the first time functionally relevant mutations of CITED2   in patients with congenital heart defects (CHD) (Sperling et al . Human Mutation 26(6), 575 582, 2005) . Recent reports have demonstrated  that mice lacking the transcription factor Cited2 die in utero showing various cardiac malformations .  CITED2  encodes a CBREBBP/EP300  interacting transcriptional modulator of HIF1A and TFAP2 . To study the potential impact of sequence variations in CITED2  for  CHD in human, we screened a cohort of 392 well characterized  patients and 192 control individuals using DHPLC, sequencing  and AmplifluorÃ¢ÂÂ¢ genotyping techniques. We identified 15 CITED2   nucleotide alterations, thereof seven alterations that were only found  in CHD patients and not detected in controls including three mutations leading to alterations of the amino acid sequence (p .Ser170_Gly178del, p .Gly178_Ser179ins9, p .Ser198_Gly199del) . All three of the amino  acid changing mutations cluster in the serine glycine rich junction of the protein to which so far no functionality had been assigned . Here we  show that these mutations significantly reduce the capacity of CITED2 to transrepress HIF1A, additionally the p .Ser170_Gly178del mutation  significantly diminishes TFAP2C coactivation. This reveals a modifying role for the serine glycine rich region in CITED2 function . In summary,  these observed mutations occurring in patients with septal defects  indicate the causative impact of CITED2  in the development of CHD  in human . c33. mutations in Desmoglein 2 gene are associated to  arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy K.

Rampazzo1;   1Department of Biology, Padua, Italy, 2Department of Cardio Thoracic vascular  Sciences, Padua, Italy, 3Institute of Pathology, Padua, Italy, 4Department of  Pediatrics, Houston, TX, United States. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a  myocardial disease characterized by progressive myocyte loss and  fibrous and fatty tissue replacement of the right ventricular free wall, which is the substrate for reentrant arrhythmias and sudden death .  The primarily mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with reduced  and age related penetrance. Five disease genes have been identified  so far, three of them (desmoplakin, plakophilin 2 and plakoglobin) are involved in the desmosomal complex . We hypothesized that mutations in desmoglein 2 (DSG2), the only  desmoglein isoform expressed in cardiac myocytes, may account for ARVC . Sixty ARVC probands were screened for DSG2 mutations by  denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and  direct sequencing. Ten DSG2 mutations have been identified in 9 patients (15%) . Among the DSG2 mutations, six were missense  (Y86C, G100R, N266S, K294E, E331K, V391I), two insertion deletions  (G678fsX681, E418fsX419), one a nonsense (Q558X) and one a splice site mutation (1181 2A>G) . None of the detected nucleotide changes was found in 560 control chromosomes . An endomyocardial biopsy  was obtained in five patients, showing extensive loss of myocytes with  fibro fatty tissue replacement. In three of them, electron microscopy ESHG Concurrent Sessions investigation was performed, showing intercalated disc paleness,  decreased desmosome number and intercellular gap widening . This is the first demonstration that mutations in DSG2 gene are  associated to ARVC. Based upon current data, we confirm that many forms of ARVC are due to alterations in the desmosome complex . c34. Genotype  Phenotype correlation in Patients with short  stature: Clinical indicators of SHOX Haploinsufficiency G. Rappold1, W. F. Blum2, B. J. Crowe3, R. Roeth1, E. P. Shavrikova4, C.

Short stature affects three in a hundred children . Despite an assumed  extraordinary genetic heterogeneity, mutations in a single gene,  SHOX , which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor involved  in bone growth, are relatively frequently found in patients with short  stature. Haploinsufficiency of the SHOX  gene causes short stature with  varying phenotypes ranging from isolated short stature to Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis and Langer dysplasia . In this study, we assessed  the association between the genotype and phenotype in a large cohort of short children from 14 different countries with an average age of 7 .6 years . Screening of 1641 unrelated children with sporadic or familial  short stature revealed SHOX  mutations in 68 (4 .2%) individuals . While  mean height was not different between patients with and without  SHOX  deficiency ( 2.57 versus  2.58 SDS), detailed anthropometric  measurements in all children revealed several bone deformities  including short forearm and lower leg, cubitus valgus, Madelung  deformity, high arched palate and muscular hypertrophy that differed  significantly (p<0.001). These phenotypic data were analysed and  compared to 33 children with Turner syndrome where haploinsufficiency  of SHOX is thought to be responsible for the height deficit. Different  types of SHOX  mutations (48/70.6% classified as complete deletions,  4/5 .9% as partial deletions and 16/23 .5% as point mutations) were  also compared to the respective phenotype suggesting a tendency  towards a more severe phenotype in individuals with homeodomain missense mutations . Altogether, this study offers a detailed genotype  phenotype comparison in a large cohort of children with short stature  and provides clear quantitative guidelines as to which children call for  testing of the  SHOX gene . c35.

PTEN related disorder is the preferred term encompassing a group of  syndromes including Bannayan Zonana, Riley Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRR), benign familial macrocephaly and Cowden syndrome . We  present a clinical study of 30 individuals from 18 families with a known PTEN mutation . The patients were ascertained through clinical  geneticists or via the BRR patient group with the aim of documenting  the different clinical presentations dependent on age and deriving information about the national history of the condition . The age range of the probands was between 2 years and 69 years of age . The commonest presentation in childhood was developmental delay  . In adulthood the presentation was more varied and included  cerebellar disease and bowel cancer. Pertinent clinical findings of  the whole cohort included the observations that all patients were  macrocephalic with a head circumference over the 98th centile; four  out of thirty had a diagnosis within the autism spectrum, walking was  delayed with an average age of 20 months and twelve individuals had required speech therapy  . On examination, only one adult had normal  skin . Of fourteen adults who have been investigated eleven have benign thyroid disease . There were no cases of malignant thyroid disease, but one case of breast and colon cancer was observed . In conclusion, we did not demonstrate a genotype phenotype  correlation; variable expression within and between families was seen. Penetrance of the condition is age related . Practical clinical diagnostic and management tools will be discussed .c36. Pattern of p6 mutations and their phenotypes in human  ectodermal dysplasia syndromes T. Rinne , B. C. Hamel, R. Meijer, H. Scheffer, H. van Bokhoven, H. G. Brunner;   Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor gene p63 are  causative at least for six syndromes with various combinations of ectodermal dysplasia, orofacial clefting and limb malformations .  Symptoms in these syndromes are overlapping, but different enough to be considered as a single syndrome . EEC and AEC syndromes  present a strong genotype phenotype association, whereas association in the other syndromes is more ambiguous . We present the results  of an extensive study, which is based on 227 patients carrying a  p63 mutation. This study confirms previously observed genotype  phenotype associations . Yet, we also demonstrate that a remarkable  phenotypic variation can be recognized in individual syndromes, even  among patients carrying the same p63 mutation . Almost 90% of the EEC syndrome mutations are caused by five mutations . The phenotypic delineation of these Ã¢ÂÂhot spotÃ¢ÂÂ mutations  reveals that each of these five individual mutations imposes different  risks towards specific aspects of the complete phenotypic spectrum.  For example, patients with a R227 mutation rarely have facial clefts, whereas these are seen in >80% of patients with a R304 mutation .  Likewise, kidney and urethral problems were observed in 40% of  patients with an R227 mutation, but never among patients with a  R280 mutation. These and other mutation specific characteristics may  reflect the importance of these amino acids in a certain developmental event . Furthermore, ADULT syndrome presents a Ã¢ÂÂhot spotÃ¢ÂÂ mutation  R298, and clarifies the phenotypic difference between Limb Mammary syndrome . Finally, this study illustrates the minor differences between AEC and RHS, which let us to consider them to be a single entity  .",2006.0,,"Hammer1, C. H. Grimm1, I. Dunkel1, S. Mebus2, H.

49,clinical and molecular characterizationof a case of  autism associated with an interstitial 1q deletion (1q23.3 24.2) in  a patient with a de novo  apparently balanced 1;5 translocation,P0027.,,"Reciprocal translocations represent one of the most common structural  rearrangements observed in man, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1/673 to 1/1000 . They usually are inherited, but can also  occur as de novo  mutations, that are much rarer entities . We report on a male patient showing developmental delay, minor dysmorphic features and autism . Standard cytogenetic analysis  revealed that he carried a de novo  apparently balanced translocation,  t(1;5)(q23;q22). Searching for cryptic chromosome abnormalities, YAC  clones in the region of the chromosomal breakpoints were selected and used as FISH probes . The patient showed a deletion in chromosome 1 from q23 .3 to q24 .2, with a loss of about 8 Mb . In an attempt to further  characterize the deletion, with the aim to delineate a better genotype  phenotype correlation, whole genome screening was conducted using array based CGH analysis, at a resolution of 75 kb . The array CGH  data confirmed a cryptic deletion in the q23.3 to q24.2 region, without  other imbalances. The breakpoints were better refined and the size of the deletion was evaluated in 4 .97 Mb . When an individual carries an apparently balanced de novo   rearrangement, the risk for phenotypic abnormalities is significantly  higher than for an individual who has inherited a similar rearrangement from a normal parent . A number of different mechanisms can be responsible for the abnormal phenotypes . In our patient the clinical  picture is most likely caused by deletion of one or more genes in 1q23 .3  >q24 .2, a region of rising interest in the research for autism susceptibility genes .Clinical genetics106",2006.0,,"Scarano1, M.

50,Ring chromosome 17 in a girl with autism,P0028.,,"A mosaic of ring chromosome 17 and chromosome 17 monosomy was  found in a girl with neurofibromatosis, mild dysmorphic features, growth  and mental retardation, and atypical autism . The ring chromosome was  further analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and  multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of subtelomeric regions . The classical cytogenetics mapped the breakpoints on both arms of the ring chromosome to the terminal G bands . The molecular  methods showed the absence of both subtelomeric loci but presence of the MDLS region on 17p . Therefore, the extent of the deletions must be between 0 .6 2 .5 Mb on 17p, and 0 .6 10 Mb on 17q . Interestingly,  the girl meets the NIH criteria for neurofibromatosis. Based on this and  on a literature review we argue that in addition to the universal Ã¢ÂÂring  syndromeÃ¢ÂÂ which is based on ring instability and is less specific for  the chromosome involved, various ring chromosomes may underlie their own characteristic phenotypes . In our patient the symptoms of  neurofibromatosis could be attributed to the mosaic hemizygosity for the NF1 gene in some of her somatic cells . Several candidate  loci for autism have been mapped to chromosome 17, and mosaic  hemizygosity or direct involvement of respective genes in the  aberration could possibly influence also this facet of the phenotype of our proband . It is a question if the chromosome 17 monosomy in a  substantial fraction of her somatic cells can also have consequences  for other future risks, for example due to her mosaic hemizygosity for the BRCA1 and TP53 genes .

PBS syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males, with less than 3% occurring in female patients . We have  studied 3 male patients aged 0 11 years with PBS in order to appreciate  the frequency of different clinical features and to present some  particularities. Physical examinations revealed deficiency of abdominal wall muscles and cryptorchidism in all patients . Investigations (renal  ultrasound, CT, contrast voiding cystourethrogram, echocardiography)  showed various abnormalities: hypoplastic right kidney in one patient,  bilateral hydronephrosis in 2 patients, dilated ureters in all patients,  large and thick walled bladder in 2 patients, posterior urethral valve, vesicoureteral reflux and cardiac anomalies (ASD, PDA) in one patient.  We have established the diagnosis of PBS based on the characteristic  association of lack of abdominal muscles, cryptorchidism and urinary tract malformations . Differential diagnosis was done with other types of  urinary tract anomalies (megacystis megaureter, urethral obstruction,  primary vesicourethral reflux, neurogenic bladder). The plan for the management and the follow up of the patients will be presented . The  prognosis depends on the degree of renal function compromise and the presence of extra urinary anomalies, especially cardiac . A possible case in a girl will be presented for discussion .

In 7 10% of SRS patients, a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD7) can be detected .We describe a 4 .5 y old boy, with SRS and UPD of chromosome 7 .  Along with the clinical findings that are described in this syndrome he  had sever developmental delay which is not commonly found in these  patients and an autistic regression that was not described before in this syndrome . A possible explanation for the autistic regression might be the tendency for undetected hypoglycemic events in children with SRS . Another  explanation is that the autism is not a part of SRS but is due to the chromosomal abnormality  . A rare but important type of abnormality  that accounts for some of cases of autism is uniparental disomy (UPD) . There is a well established association of UPD with autism and  the imprinted 15q11 q13 Prader Willi/ Angelman syndrome (PW/AS) region . Recently there was a case with UPD of chromosome 1 and autism . This case suggests an association of autism with a locus on chromosome 7 . UPD can cause disease by two mechanisms . First,  imprinted genes are subject to selective expression that depends on the parental origin . Second, UPD can also cause disease by unmasking recessive mutations that fall within regions of isodisomy  .",2006.0,,"Vinkler1, O. Vardi2, M. Davidovich2, T. Sagie3, D.

93,A defect in the ionotropic glutamate receptor 6 gene  (GLUR6) causes autosomal recessive mental retardation,C39.,,"Mental retardation (MR) is among the most common forms of genetic  handicaps. So far, however very little is known about the gene defects  underlying this disorder. Especially the contribution of autosomal re   cessive hereditary defects is largely unresolved and to date, only three  genes have been found to be directly associated with non syndromic  autosomal recessive MR (NS ARMR). We have previously identified 8 new genomic loci for NS ARMR  (MRT6 11) and report here a complex deletion inversion mutation in  the glutamate receptor 6 gene (GLUR6, GRIK2), a member of the kai   nate receptor family. GLUR6 maps to the MRT6 locus, a 10Mb linkage  interval on Chr6q16.3, which we have recently identified in a large con   sanguineous Iranian family with moderate to severe non syndromic  ARMR. As shown by Southern blotting, inverse PCR, array CGH and  cloning experiments, the sequence changes include a deletion of ap   proximately 120Kb including exons 7 and 8, as well as an inversion of  about 80Kb that encompasses exons 9 to 11. This mutation was not  found in 172 controls, and the integrity of the coding sequence of 7  other potential candidate genes in the interval was verified by direct  sequencing. Glutamate receptor signalling has previously been implicated in the  pathogenesis of the fragile X syndrome and may also play a role in  autism. However, our studies provide the first direct evidence for the  importance of glutamate receptors in human cognition. Moreover, they  have implications for the diagnosis and prevention of NS ARMR and  may shed new light on the role of ion channels in the human brain.Concurrent Sessions2",2007.0,,"M. Motazacker1, B.

Clinical findings include broad short neck, frontal  bossing, low set ears, skinfolds behind ear helices, high muscular to   nus, height 2.5 10 perc., weight 50 perc., head circumference 25 50  perc. and bilateral testis retention. He had normal hearing, but no lan   guage. There was no history of heart disease or mental retardation in  the family. Pregnancy and birth was normal. His cardiopulmonary anomalies were consistent with incomplete Scim  Clinical genetics1 itar syndrome, which is a rare anomaly of pulmonary venous return to  the vena cave inferior. Chromosome analysis on routine G banded chromosomes was nor   mal. However, CGH showed a deletion on chromosome 10(p11.2p12.1).  Extended G banding (900 band level) and array CGH confirmed the  deletion, and breakpoints were suggested to be (p11.23p12.1). Several deletions in the short arm of chromosome 10 have been pub   lished in literature and in the ECARUCA chromosome database, but  to our knowledge these deletions are all larger than the deletion our  patient has. In addition, all patients described have a more severe phe   notype than our patient.

167,Interstitial duplication 15q11 13 in a patient with Asperger  autism and seizures,P0029.,,"We present a boy who was diagnosed to have Asperger autism at the  age of 19 years. Furthermore the boy suffers from seizures since the age of 16 years.  Intelligence is in normal range. The patient finished non classical secondary school with good marks.  Afterwards he tried to graduate from expert school for social sciences which could not be  completed because of his special defects in social competence and  communication skills, and his deficiency of empathy which, at the end  of the initiated diagnostic procedure, led to the diagnosis of Asperger  autism. Since recent studies (1) were able to show a defined interstitial dupli   cation of chromosome15q11 13 in a few patients with autism disorder  (1 3%) we investigated this region with respect to this abnormality . We were able to show a duplication of the region of interest with the  proof of three alleles for the internal markers D15S122, D15S822 and  D15S1234. Furthermore we could confirm this result with FISH using the probe  GABRB3 (15q11 12),which showed three signals on meta  and inter   phase chromosomes. Parental investigations (FISH and molecular analysis) were inconspic   uous. Microsatellite analysis showed that the duplication did arise from  the boy`s maternal chromosome 15, as described in the literature (2). The proposed mechanism is misalignment in maternal meiotic recom   bination. The influence of parental imprinting on phenotype will be discussed; the  variation of the symptoms of the yet published cases will be shown.",2007.0,,"Oehl Jaschkowitz1, T. Martin1, E. Goettert1, A.

FAS is defined by: pre/postnatal growth retarda   tion, facial dismorphysm and SNC dysfunction. We have used the Canadian guidelines for FASD to analyze our pa   tients in order to appreciate their importance in establishing the diag   nosis. This involved evaluation score for upper lip, philtrum, palpebral  fissures, impaired pre/postnatal growth, CNS/neurobehavioural disor   ders and gestational exposure to alcohol. 63 children (FASD in observation between 1994 2006) were selected  for the study. Only 47 patients fulfilled the criteria for FASD (25  definite FAS, 6  p FAS and 5  ARND). The 11 children left remain in observa   tion due to young age.

256,Fragile X syndrome in Estonia,P0118.,,"The Fragile X syndrome is the most common human chromosomal  monogenic disease associated with heritable mental retardation, and  is the second most frequent cause of mental retardation after Down  syndrome. Our study consists of the screening of 561 Estonian chil   dren having mental retardation, autism, delayed speech and/or behav   ioral problems. The patient samples were sent to the United Laborato   ries of Tartu University Hospital for screening of fragile X mutation from  year 1997 to 2006. The molecular study for the diagnosis has been  performed by two different techniques. During 1997 2001 the South   ern blot analysis and later PCR with fluorescently marked primers fol   lowed by CGG repeat length detection at ABI PRISM 377 was used.  Among 561 (477 boys/84 girls) patients we found 15 full mutations  (14 boys/ 1 girl), and 1 premutation in a girl. The main indication for  the analysis in diagnosed boys was mental retardation in 11 patients,  autism in 2 patients, and characteristic phenotype in 1 patient. The girl  with a full mutation was investigated due to psychomotor retardation  and delayed speech. The girl with a premutation had mild mental re   tardation and primary ovarian failure. The birth prevalence of full muta   tion in FMR1 gene causing fragile X syndrome is 1 in 25,308 among  individuals born during 1984 2006.

In a subset of 18 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and ex   treme macrocephaly, Butler et al. recently reported 3 young boys with a  germline missense PTEN  mutation ( J Med Genet 2005;42:318 ). Here,  we report on a 6 year old girl referred for global developmental delay,  language regression and pervasive developmental disorder. The asso   ciation with progressive macrocephaly (+3DS at birth and +5DS at 6y)  prompted us to perform a PTEN  gene analysis in the leucocyte DNA of  the patient. We identified a heterozygous G to A transition in exon 6 of  PTEN , resulting in an arginine173 to histidine (p.Arg173His) substitu   tion. Arginine173 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue whose  subsitution by histidine has been shown to lead, in an in vitro  assay,  to a drastic reduction (95%) of the phosphatase activity of PTEN . In  terestingly, this p.Arg173His missense mutation has already been re   ported by several authors but only as a somatic mutation identified in  glioblastomas and astrocytomas. Initially, germline mutations of PTEN   have been found in patients with Cowden disease or Bannayan Riley  Ruvalcaba syndrome. However, as in the three previously reported  cases, the present patient had no mucocutaneous lesions suggestive  of these two hamartoma syndromes. The possibility of developing spe   cific alterations of Cowden disease during the second decade should  be considered.

Among the three genes of the minimal critical region (from  centromere to telomere: SHANK3 , ACR  and RABL2B ), SHANK3  is  considered to be at the origin of the neurobehavioral symptoms. We report a child with a de novo  interstitial 22q13.3 deletion detected  by MLPA and confirmed by FISH. She demonstrates mental retardation, severe speech delay, epicanthic  fold, and protruding ears with normal growth. This non specific pheno   type is concordant with the classical presentation of 22q13.3 deletion  syndrome. Subtelomeres analysis by MLPA showed a discrepancy between the  P036B and P070 kits (MCR Holland): P070 MLPA probe (targeting  ARSA  gene) showed a deletion but P036B (targeting RABL2B  gene)  showed a normal result.

440,Frequency of mosaic aneuploidy in children with  idiopathic autism,P0303.,,"It has been repeatedly suggested that numerous human diseases in   cluding major psychiatric disorders could be associated with mosaic  aneuploidy. Here, we have attempted to test this hypothesis concern   ing autism, a common childhood psychiatric disorder. About 5 10% of  autism cases are known to be caused by chromosomal abnormalities  or gene mutations. However, mosaic aneuploidy in autism has not ever  been studied. We surveyed stochastic aneuploidy in children with/with   out idiopathic autism by interphase multiprobe fluorescence in situ hy   bridization (mFISH). The rate of chromosome loss and gain involving  six arbitrarily selected autosomes (chromosomes 1, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18)  and sex chromosomes was assessed in peripheral blood cells of 60  unaffected male children and 116 male children with idiopathic autism.  Studying over 420,000 cells, we have determined the mean frequency  of stochastic aneuploidy in control and autism: Control Chromosome loss Chromosome gain Autosomes   Sex chromosomes0.58% (95% CI 0.42 0.75%)   _0.15% (95% CI 0.09 0.21%)   1.11% (95% CI 0.90 1.31%) Autism Autosomes   Sex chromosomes0.60% (95% CI 0.37 0.83%)   _0.22% (95% CI 0.14 0.30%)   1.01% (95% CI 0.85 1.17%) CI   confidence interval The difference of stochastic aneuploidy rate was insignificant. However, the frequency  of mosaic aneuploidy over the background level was found in 19 (16%) of 116 children  with idiopathic autism, while outlier values were not found in controls. These data  identify mosaic aneuploidy as a new autism genetic risk factor. Therefore, molecular  cytogenetic analysis of somatic mosaicism is warranted in children with idiopathic au   tism.

485,A patient with Williams Beuren syndrome and inv dup(15),P0348.,,"In the literature, very few reports describe the concomitant presence of  2 anomalies leading to 2 different genetic syndromes. The contribution  of each anomaly to the phenotype is still unclear. This report describes  a case presenting contemporarily a Williams Beuren Syndrome (WBS)  and an inv dup(15) syndrome. WBS is a microdeletion syndrome characterized by typical cardiovas   cular defects, facial dysmorphisms, connective tissue abnormalities,  mild mental retardation, specific cognitive profile, endocrine abnor  Cytogenetics112 malities and feeding difficulties. Hypotonia and hyperextensible joints  can result in delayed attainment of motor milestones. Inv dup(15) syn   drome presents peculiar physical findings (muscle hypotonia, minor  facial dysmorphisms), mental retardation, seizure, autism. An 11 years old boy with mild mental retardation showing some of these  anomalies was referred to our examination. He was born at term with  eutocic delivery with normal auxologic parameters. Phisycal exami   nation: talus valgus pronate feet, gastroesophageal reflux, hypotonia  and feeding difficulties. Later, he manifested systemic hypertension,  growth (weight/height < 3rdcentile) and psychomotor delay. Echocar   diography showed a mild supravalvular aortic stenosis, hypothyroidism  was excluded. Calcium blood profile was normal. Cytogenetic analysis  revealed this karyotype: 47,XY,+inv dup(15)(q12)de novo. Although some features of the patient such as cortex anomalies, short  and stubby hands and feet were specific of the iso dic(15), the peculiar  facies and cardiac defect suggested a WBS. Molecular cytogenetic analysis (FISH) was performed with WBSCR  specific probe, the presence of specific microdeletion in 7q11.2 was  confirmed.

797,Serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms and  intraplatelet serotonin concentration in autism,P0662.,,"Serotonin is released in pre synaptic membrane and can reach spe   cific receptors in post synaptic membrane or be partially reuptaked by  its specific transporter at the synaptic cleft. Serotonin circulating levels  and its effects depend on specific serotonin transporter activity whose  efficacy changes with its gene polymorphisms. In that way, serotonin transporter gene may be a likely candidate in autistic dis   order. The aim of this study is to determine a possible association  between serotonin tranporter gene polymorphisms 5 HTTVNTR and  5 HTTLPR and autism and to evaluate intraplatelet serotonin concen   tration. Patient group was made of 118 individuals (3,6 and 41 years) subdivid   ed in 82 with idiopathic autism, 15 with pathology associated autism,  15 with PPD Nos and 6 with Asperger syndrome. Control group was  made of 68 individuals (45,57ÃÂ±11,23 years). We studied 5 HTTLPR and 5 HTTVNTR by PCR and intraplatelet se   rotonin concentration by ELISA. We found no significant differences in genotype and allelic frequencies between patient subgroups and between patient and control groups in  both polymorphisms. we found a significant higher serotonina concentration in the patient  group when compared with control individuals. We did not find sig   nificant differences between the different genotypes of both polymor   phisms and serotonin concentration. In this study we did no find any association between serotonin trans   porter gene polymorphisms and autism. Autistic patients have higher intraplatelet serotonin concentration,  which may contribute for their characteristic behaviour disturbances. Intraplatelet serotonin concentration is independent of serotonin trans   porter gene polymorphisms.",2007.0,,"Ferreira, P. Levy , M.

985,Mutations in the MECP2 gene in patients of Slavonic  origin with Rett syndrome,P0852.,,"Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder  affecting almost exclusively females. It has an incidence of 1:10,000  female births and is characterized by apparently normal development  for the first 6 18 months of life followed by the loss of acquired motor  and language skills, autistic features, and development of stereotypic  hand movements. Rett syndrome is caused primarily by de novo mu   tations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Methyl  CpG binding protein 2 plays important roles in the regulation of gene  expression and RNA splicing. Here we report the mutational analysis  of the MECP2 gene in 95 patients from the Czech and Slovak Repub   lics and the Ukraine with classical Rett syndrome. The patients, all  girls, were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing of the entire  coding sequence and the exon/intron boundaries of the MECP2 gene.  RFLP analysis was performed to confirm the mutations that cause the  creation or abolition of the restriction site. Mutation negative cases  were subsequently examined by multiple ligation dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) to identify large deletions. Sequencing analysis  revealed 33 different mutations in 74 patients, and MLPA analysis re   vealed large deletions in two patients. The detection rate was 78%.  One mutation in exon 1 (c.48_55del8) has not been published yet. Our  results confirm the high frequency of MECP2 mutations in females with  Rett syndrome and provide data concerning the mutation heterogene   ity in the Slavonic population.

However, the role of serotonin receptors in its pathophisiology still re   mains poorly understood. In this study, we present results from a case  control association study within 14 polymorphisms in five serotonin  receptors genes (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR1D, HTR2A, HTR2C).

259,cADHERiN 11 as a possible candidate gene for autism,P01.247,,"Child Psychiatry, Leuven,  Belgium, 3University Center for Child and Youth Psychiatry, Antwerp, Belgium. Background: Positional cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in autism  patients is a valuable strategy towards the identification of candidate  genes, especially in isolated autism, and when the aberration is de novo and family history is negative for autism . (1) Objectives:  We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ  of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods:  1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro   scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON   SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat   ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the  AK13094  gene, another was near GFOD  and RANBP10  . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11   gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11  is expressed in  the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses . (2) Interestingly, there is evidence that  altered synaptogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism .  For instance, the cell adhesion molecules NLGN 3  and  4 are impli   cated in autism through their role in the establishment of functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons .

Clinical signs in childhood have many similarities, early diagno   sis using molecular genetic analysis is important as syndromes give  increased risk for different tumors . We describe a family, where both young parents of our index patient  were treated due to tumors  mother had bladder carcinoma, treated  during pregnancy and father was treated due to embryonal testicular carcinoma . Proband is the first and only child in the family. His birth anthropom   etry (4020g/52cm, OFC 41cm) was above 97th centile. During the first  two years of his life he had psychomotor developmental problems,  hypotonia, seizures with EEG changes, autistic features, unilateral hy   drocele and macrocephaly  . Metabolic workshop excluded metabolic  disorders . At the age of three years three lipomas were (histologically proved)diagnosed  two subcutaneous and one pancreatic . The patient  had different skin symptoms, no pigmentation of the glans penis . He  had macrocephaly and mild mental retardation and some autistic fea   tures and speech problems . Mutation analysis of PTEN  gene was performed by Dr  .D .O .Robinsin  (Salisbury Health Care NHS Trust) . The patient is carring a C>A substi   tution at base 144, in exon 2 of the PTEN gene .

331,multiple minor congenital defects associated with autism  spectrum disorders,P01.319,,"Autism spectrum disorders represent a wide spectrum of conditions  characterized by abnormalities of social interactions and communica   tion, severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior  . They  have multiple genetic and nongenetic causes . In order to ascertain  the cause and the onset of the disorder, establishing a positive cor   relation with some markers would be useful . Minor congenital defects  result from either genetic or environmental causes that act during  pregnancy and are an indirect measure of abnormal embryo and fe   tal development . The purpose of the study was to see if patients with  autism spectrum disorders have more minor congenital defects than  healthy individuals and if so, if this finding correlates with the history of the patients . The incidence and media of minor congenital defects  were determined in 76 patients with autism spectrum disorders and in unrelated control subjects matched by age and sex . The frequency  of minor anomalies was not significantly different in the two groups, 14 .47% in autistic children and teenagers, compared to 14 .80% in healthy controls . The mean number of minor congenital anomalies  was significantly higher in the autistic group, 3ÃÂ±0.70 minor defects/pa   tient, compared to 1 .43ÃÂ±0 .36 minor defects/patient in controls .

Copy number  variations (CNV) are an important source of variation and genes locat   ed therein are likely to have altered expression patterns, therefore con   tributing to phenotypic changes . Twenty AS patients without the typical  molecular alterations but with well defined clinical features were ana   lysed by aCGH using the 244K Agilent platform . Altered regions that  contained rare CNVs (<2 findings in the literature) or not reported in  the Database of Genomic Variants were selected for custom Multiple  Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA) assays. We assessed the CNV  status using MLPA (52 regions) in the 20 AS family trios, and expanded the study to idiopathic mental retardation (n,220) and autism (n,100) .  CNV analysis by MLPA was also assessed in 450 control samples . The  findings included: two de novo deletions (1p36, 1q44), one maternally  inherited duplication (Xp11 .23), altered regions in diseases cases but not present in controls (4q31 .3, 6q21, 6q26, 7q22 .1, Xp11 .23, Xp22 .2  and Xq28), and several inherited genomic variants (5q31 .2, 9q33 .1,  10p12 .33, 16p13 .3, 17p13 .1 and 19q13 .41) not found neither in other samples nor in controls . Our results support the view that a consider   able proportion of genomic regions showing variability in copy number could be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders .

449,Frequent 22q11 aberrations in patients with non syndromic autism spectrum disorders shown by sNP array based  segmental aneuploidy screening,P02.067,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions  characterized by impaired reciprocal social interaction, communicative  deficits, and restricted behavioral patterns. ASD occurs in syndromic  forms and as non syndromic cases frequently involving cytogenetic abnormalities . Recently, array based genome wide screens have demonstrated frequent copy number variation in non syndromic ASD .  Screening 56 patients with autism and additional major or minor anom   alies with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP platform (Illumina, Inc.,  San Diego, CA) we found in 16 patients 9 regions with deleted and 9 with duplicated signals . Aberrant signals were distributed among 16 distinct chromosomal loci .

The  duplications were confirmed by multiplex ligation mediated probe am   plification and are likely to involve LCRs A, B and D. We conclude that  SNP array based screening of ASD patients uncovers an appreciable  number of CNVs, which in part overlap with loci already discovered by  other approaches. Our finding that 3 out of 56 ASD patients carried aberrations within the 22q11 region is highly unexpected .

Other characteristic finding was the babyÃ¢ÂÂs strange crying. Some mi   nor anomalities could be detected, such as low and back sitting ears,  short palpebral fissure, abnormal shape of the cranium, and clubbed  fingers. In the family history was no abnormality. Because of minor ab   normalities and congenital heart defect cytogenetic investigations was done .

491,"CSMD , a candidate gene for autism found in two patients with  autistic disorder and balanced translocations",P02.110,,"The study of chromosomal rearrangements associated with abnormal  phenotypes has proven to be a powerful method for the identification of disease related genes . Recent studies estimated a rate of 3 5% of  cytogenetic abnormalities involving many different chromosomes in autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) . We report here on two unrelated  males with de novo  translocations, autistic behaviour and psychomotor  delay  . They carry balanced chromosome translocations, respectively a  t(5;8)(q14 .3;q23 .3) and t(6;8)(q13;q23 .2) . A detailed physical map cov   ering the regions involved in the translocations was constructed and  FISH analyses were carried out using BAC clones mapping on chro   mosomes 5q14.3, 6q13 and 8q23. We fine mapped the two transloca   tion breakpoints on chromosomes 8 identifying their positions within a short 5 Mb genomic region . The results of these analyses showed that  breakpoints on chromosomes 8 in both patients do not interrupt any  known gene but both map in a region containing the CSMD3  gene .  No genes were interrupted on chromosomes 5q14 .3 and 6q13 . Tak   ing into account that CSMD3 is expressed in fetal and adult brain, our  observations suggest that this gene is a good candidate for the patho   genesis of ASDs . To exclude an over expression or under expression  of CSMD3  leaded by the rearrangement, we verified the expression  of this gene in the leukocytes of the translocated patient by RT PCR, but any transcript was detected . Future studies, including mutational  analysis of CSMD3 in a large number of patients affected by autism  and behavioural studies on a Csmd3  knockout mouse, will be neces   sary to confirm or decline this hypothesis.",2008.0,,"C.

1155,the BDNF receptor gene NTRK  is a susceptibility gene for  autism,P06.034,,"Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder likely determined by multiple genes . The  NTRK2  gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu   rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which  promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant  transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns  5 6  and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) .

No muta   tions were identified in these individuals, and there was no evidence  for association of NTRK2 with plasma BDNF distribution .

We  hypothesize that several different rare variants in numerous genes,  including de novo  variants, could lead to these diseases . Therefore, we decided to directly sequence, in 285 AUT and SCZ pa   tients, genes coding for proteins involved in the synapse, as defects in synaptic processes can lead to impairment in cognitive function . We  decided to focus on the X chromosome, as evidence supports its impli   cation in the predisposition to AUT especially, but also to SCZ . Using various methods and sources, we established a complete list  of 183 synaptic and potentially synaptic genes located on this chro   mosome and we ranked them according to their relevance for the diseases . We selected in this way 104 X linked candidate genes that  have been sequenced in our patient cohort. We have already identified  more than hundred rare non synonymous variants in AUT and SCZ patients . Some of them are particularly interesting due to their inheri   tance mode and their potential effect on the protein .

Quantitative TDT (QTDT) was used to assess  marker trait association using both orthogonal (within family) and to   tal (within  and between  family) association to three reading related measures . These measures, taken from the Wechsler Objective Read   ing Dimensions (WORD), assess basic reading, spelling, and reading  comprehension. Single SNP orthogonal analysis identified association  of these measures to SNPs within MRPL19/C2ORF3  on chromosome  2, and DCDC2  on chromosome 6 . Total association was found to the  same SNP in MRPL19/C2ORF3 , and also to a SNP within KIAA0319   on chromosome 6 . We used the SNP data to reconstruct haplotypes  that had previously been reported to be associated with dyslexia . In  this analysis, association was replicated only in the KIAA0319  gene  and with all reading related measures . This investigation therefore in   dicates that the loci identified by studies of dyslexia, and in particular  KIAA0319 , may also contribute to reading ability in language impaired  populations .Molecular and biochemical basis of disease 0P06.273 intronic sequence changes may have unpredictable effects on  splicing F. Joncourt , S. Gallati;   Human Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Berne, Swit   zerland. Mutation scanning often identifies yet undescribed sequence changes  in genomic DNA, which are not easily classified as either pathogenic or neutral solely by sequence inspection . Increasing knowledge about  the splicing process has revealed its great complexity: In addition to  the well known splice site consensus sequences in recent years a mul   titude of regulatory elements have been identified both within introns  as well as within exons. In order to assess / confirm their pathogenic  nature, we have analysed the effect on splicing of several yet func   tionally uncharacterized intronic sequence changes in different genes by analysing their respective RNAÃ¢ÂÂs . Lymphocytes from patients were  immortalized, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed . The cDNA  was then amplified by PCR and analysed by PAGE or agarose gel elec   trophoresis . Bands with altered electrophoretic mobility were isolated,  purified and sequenced. Two mutations located within the conserved  donor and acceptor splice sites respectively (NF1: c .3496+1G>A and SPG4: c .1688 2A>G) were shown to lead to exon skipping as expect   ed. c.357+2T>A identified in a patientÃ¢ÂÂs DMD gene, however, resulted  in the inclusion of 31 bases of intronic sequence into the mRNA lead   ing to a frameshift, while exon skipping would have left the reading frame intact . This latter case further illustrates that the effect of an  unknown mutation on the splicing process can not easily be predicted .  The results emphasize the need for functional characterization of new   ly described sequence changes .",2008.0,,"L. Addis , D. F. Newbury, L. Winchester, S. L. I. Consortium (SLIC), A. P.

Subtelomeric rear   rangements (SR) play an important role in idiopatic MR determinism .  Recently introduced MLPA (Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification)  technique seems to provide good results in SRÃ¢ÂÂs identification. We  have used MLPA to identify SR in children with idiopatic MR, the proto   col consisting of the following sequence: clinical selection based on de  Vries score; karyotype; antiFMRP test for Fragile X syndrome screen   ing; PCR for Fragile X syndrome diagnosis; MLPA testing using 2 inde   pendent kits in order to separate polymorphisms . Parents were tested  if an abnormality was detected in their child (by karyotype/MLPA) . The study group was formed of 223 children that had a de Vries score  of 3/more . All patient data were recorded in a database specially de   signed . In 28 of them (12 .5%) the karyotype revealed different abnor   malities . 17 cases (7 .6%) presented speech delay/ autism, but anti   FMRP test and PCR were normal . Out of the 195 MLPA tests done: 168 cases (86 .1% were normal, 13 (6,7%) abnormal and 14 (7 .1%) had polymorphisms . The most frequently involved SR were 1p del and  7q del. Clinical features of the cases identified with different SR will be illustrated with photos and discussed . In conclusion, we appreciate that the diagnostic score is useful in case  selection for further testing, MLPA proves to be efficient in diagnosing  SR and the frequency of SR as a possible cause of idiopatic MR is similar to other studies in the literature .",2008.0,,"A.

61,Next Generation sequencing as a promising diagnostic tool in  heterogeneous genetic conditions: the example of Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,C01.6,,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited  cardiac disorder with a remarkable genetic and allelic heterogeneity  (> 450 mutations in at least 20 genes). Molecular testing for HCM has  a growing impact on the medical management of patients/families. To  overcome the extensive genetic heterogeneity we had developed a  microarray to resequence 30 Kbp including all exons (n,160), splice  sites and 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR of 12 HCM genes (HCM custom DNA resequenc   ing array, HCM RA, Fokstuen et al, 2008). This approach, now used in  diagnostics, is very efficient and cheap but does not detect small indels  (~14% of known HCM mutations). Moreover, HCM RA lacks flexibility  since gene additions require a redesign. We now present new results obtained using short read next genera   tion sequencing (NGS) of 12 HCM genes (targeted by multi exonic  amplicons) and a new downstream data analysis pipeline. DNAs from  19 patients (11 without known mutations, 8 positive controls as a com   posite pool) were assessed in one channel (exp.A). In another chan   nel (exp.B), we sequenced a single patient with no known mutation.  Mutations were confirmed by classical sequencing. In Exp.A, all the 8  known pathogenic mutations and SNPs previously identified were also  found by NGS. Furthermore we identified novel variants: two indels  and a nonsense mutation in MYBPC3 gene that likely cause the dis   ease. In Exp.B, no pathogenic mutation but 140 non coding dbSNPs  were identified. Although improvements are needed in target enrichment and data  analysis, NGS holds considerable promises in high throughput analy   sis of mutations/variants underlying the highly heterogeneous or multi   genic genetic disorders in clinical practice.c02.1Phenotypic and genomic evaluation of 52 subjects with a smith  Magenis like phenotype: identification of new syndromic regions  associated with altered gene dosage S.

Haploinsufficiency of the retinoic acid induced 1 gene (RAI1) results  in Smith Magenis syndrome (SMS), which includes developmental  delays, sleep disturbance, self injurious behaviors, and dysmorphic  features. We evaluated 52 individuals referred for molecular analysis  due to a possible SMS diagnosis. Screening for 17p11.2 deletions and  RAI1 mutations was negative, suggesting that at least one other lo   cus is responsible for the SMS like phenotype. This cohort is clinically  indistinguishable from SMS, with >90% overlap with core features, in   cluding developmental delays, sleep disturbance, self injurious behav   iors, motor dysfunction, obesity, and behavioral anomalies of the same  type and prevalence as seen in SMS. We performed whole genome  array CGH to identify genomic lesions contributing to the SMS like  phenotypes and identified 15 CNVs/52 cases, including 10 deletions  and 5 duplications. These CNVs include novel genomic regions where  altered gene dosage has not been previously associated with any clini   cal syndrome. We also identified several well characterized regions  associated with known syndromes, suggesting a need for better clini   cal phenotyping and discrimination between syndromes, as well as  possible syndromic associations not previously appreciated. Genes in  these regions contribute to development, neurological function, and  behavior, all of which are affected in SMS. Further, some of these loci  have been associated with autism, schizophrenia, and mental retarda   tion, suggesting possible genetic heterogeneity. Given the phenotypic  overlap between the SMS and SMS like cases, these molecular data  may provide insights into the function of RAI1 and may improve di   agnosis, understanding, and potentially treatment of these complex  behavior and mental retardation syndromes.",2009.0,,"J.

63,incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in a series of 11  French patients with 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion detected using array cGH.,C02.3,,"Since the large implementation of array CGH in the diagnostic work  up of mental retardation, novel microdeletion syndromes have been  described. In particular, the 15q13.3 microdeletion has been identi   fied in 0.2 0.3% of individuals with mental retardation and epilepsy,  schizophrenia, autism and other neuropsychiatric features. The criti   cal region between BP4 and BP5 contains at least seven genes, in   cluding CHRNA7 , which is considered a good candidate gene for the  epilepsy phenotype. We report a series of 11 patients (8 index cases  and 3 affected parents) presenting a developmental delay and a 1.5  Mb 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion ascertained through 11 French  CGH array platforms. All 8 index cases presented mild to moderate  mental retardation with absent or non specific dysmorphic features.  Only two had seizures, 4 had an abnormal electroencephalogram and  none had an autistic behaviour. One patient presented a highly differ   ent phenotype, including hydrocephaly, joint dislocations, congenital  lymphoedema and notable dysmorphic features associated to men   tal retardation. Familial studies could be performed in 5/8 index pa   tients. Interestingly, all 15q13.3 microdeletions were inherited (3 from  the mother, 2 from the father). The affected parents had mild mental  retardation with epilepsy in one. In particular, the microdeletion was  found in 2 completely asymptomatic mothers. This study is in favour  of incomplete penetrance and more variable clinical expressivity than  previously published. Therefore, the 15q13.3 recurrent microdeletion  might be only considered as a risk factor for mental retardation.

136,Methylation profiling in cases with uniparental disomy identifies  novel imprinted genes on chromosome 15,C15.2,,"One of the major features associated with imprinting is the presence  of parent of origin specific Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs).  Thus, the maternal and paternal genomes possess distinct epigen   etic marks which distinguish them at imprinted loci. In order to iden   tify novel imprinted genes on chromosome 15, we have profiled DNA  methylation in cases with uniparental disomy of chromosome 15  (UPD15). Methylated DNA was immunoprecipitated using antibodies  for 5 methyl cytidine, and hybridized to high density oligonucleotide  arrays with complete coverage of chromosome 15, generating profiles  of the paternal and maternal methylomes. Comparison of six individu   als with maternal versus paternal UPD15 reveals more than twenty  DMRs on chromosome 15. Putative DMRs were validated by bisulfite  sequencing, confirming the presence of parent of origin specific meth   ylation marks in multiple samples. Many are associated with known  imprinted genes within the Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome region,  such as SNRPN  and MAGEL2 , validating this as a method of detecting  imprinted loci. However, more than half of the novel DMRs identified  are located outside of 15q11 q13, and are associated with genes not  previously thought to be imprinted. These include IGF1R  at 15q26.3,  which plays a fundamental role in growth regulation, and GABRG3 , a  gene which has previously been shown to be abnormally expressed in  autism. Many DMRs occur at CpG islands or overlap conserved non  coding regions, suggesting a role in regulating gene expression. These data provide an imprinting map of chromosome 15, demon   strate that the number of imprinted loci in humans is much higher than  previously thought, and identify novel candidates for human disease.",2009.0,,"A.

349,A possible role for the PtPN11 gene in sex determination,P02.143,,"The PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non receptor type 11)  gene carries the instructions for making a protein called protein ty   rosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11, more commonly known as  SHP 2. SHP2 forms a subgroup of this class and is a key player in  generating signals within cells that affect cell function, division and dif   ferentiation. Germline mutations in this gene have been known to be  associated with various diseases, including Noonan syndrome, LEOP   ARD syndrome, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). The  case presented here was diagnosed antenatally with cystic hygroma,  hydrops fetalis, bilateral club feet, ASD and a karyotype of 46XX. Ter   mination of pregnancy occurred at 17 weeks of gestation and autopsy  identified ambiguous genitalia and normal testes. DNA analysis for  PTPN11 showed a heterozygous C > A nucleotide change in exon 13,  which has not been previously reported. The mutation is found in a  strongly conserved domain across species. The spectrum of PTPN11 mutations and their clinical implications are  wide spread, explained by the ubiquitous expression of this protein. It  remains interesting that association of the gene with sex differentiation  or ambiguous genitalia has not been made previously. Our patient was  found to have a novel, likely pathogenic PTPN11 mutation. Although  the karyotype revealed a normal female genotype, the gonads were  normal testes with the external genitalia showing ambiguity.

455,Not so irrelevant pseudomosaicism of trisomy 18 previously  found in amniotic fluid culture,P03.047,,"In 1993, a woman (G4, P3) underwent amniocentesis because of ma   ternal age. Regular chromosome analysis resulted in thirteen colonies  showing a normal female karyotype and a single isolated metaphase  with 47,XX,+18. After extensive work up according to international pre   natal quality standards, no other colony  with trisomy 18 was found in a  total of 29 colonies. Therefore, the  finding of a single Ã¢ÂÂ47,XX,+18Ã¢ÂÂ cell  was considered to represent a pseudomosaicism and the foetus was  diagnosed with a normal female karyotype. Fifteen years later and at the age of 14, the very same girl was re   ferred to our department because of mental retardation and autistiform  behaviour. After exclusion of a (pre)mutation for Fragile X syndrome,  oligo array CGH analysis was performed, using the Agilent 105 K Ox   ford array (custom design ID: 019015), in search for a previously un   detected (sub)microscopic genomic imbalance. To our surprise, a slightly elevated ratio was found for all (2424) oligo  probes on chromosome 18, suggestive for a mosaic pattern of trisomy  18. No further genomic aberrations were detected. Subsequent FISH  analysis on interphase and metaphase cells of blood and other tissue   samples from the patient confirmed the presence of a mosaic pattern  for trisomy 18. This case demonstrates that , even after careful cytogenetic examina   tion, a Ã¢ÂÂwith near certaintyÃ¢ÂÂ irrelevant pseudomosaicism might turn out  to be a true mosaicism with clinical consequences after all.",2009.0,,"R.

470,Nine patients with a microdeletion 15q11.2 between breakpoints  1 and 2 of the Prader Willi critical region: is it clinically relevant?,P03.062,,"Behavioural differences have been described in patients with type I de   letions (between breakpoints 1 and 3, (BP1 BP2)) or type II deletions  (between breakpoints 2 and 3) of the 15q11.2 Prader Willi/Angelman  region. The larger type I deletions appear to coincide with more severe  behavioural problems (autism, ADHD, obsessive compulsive disor   der). The non imprinted chromosomal segment between breakpoints  1 and 2 involves four highly conserved genes, TUBGCP5, NIPA1,  NIPA2, and CYFIP1; the latter three are widely expressed in the cen   tral nervous system, while TUBGCP5 is expressed in the subthalamic  nuclei. These genes might explain the more severe behavioural prob   lems seen in type I deletions. We describe nine cases with a microdeletion at 15q11.2 between BP1  BP2, thus having an haploinsufficiency for TUBGCP5, NIPA1, NIPA2,  and CYFIP1 without Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome. The clinical  significance of a pure BP1 BP2 microdeletion has been debated, how   ever, our patients shared several clinical features, including delayed  motor and speech development, dysmorphisms and behavioural prob   lems (ADHD, autism, obsessive compulsive behaviour). Although the  deletion often appeared to be inherited from a normal or mildly affected  parent, it was de novo in two cases and we did not find it in 350 healthy  unrelated controls.

At the age of 9 months he had several seizure epi   sodes successfully controlled with valproic acid. Mental development  is delayed (absent speech) and the patient presents typical autistic  features. Brain MRI was unremarkable. As the deletion is de novÃÂ¿ and the missing segment only encompasses  part of NRXN1 , it is highly likely that haploinsuficieny of this gene is  causally related to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype.

We describe the identification and delineation of a 2.2Mb microdupli   cation in 1q42.2 in 2 brothers with autism and mild mental retardation. The duplication was detected by Array CGH with clones from the 1 Mb  BAC/PAC clone set (Sanger Institute Hinxton, UK). The aberration was  further delineated to 2.2Mb with a full tiling BAC array. By means of  quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) the breakpoints of the duplication  were mapped and segregation in the family was investigated. qPCR  was used to screen 260 patients with autism for DISC1  duplications. The 2.2Mb duplication was present in the proband, his affected brother  and the apparently unaffected father and paternal grandmother. Since  this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, it was con   sidered as a rare variant. Within this region the most interesting gene  with respect to autism is DISC1  (disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ) since  it is known to be involved in schizophrenia and has recently been as   sociated to autism and bipolar disorder. A group of 260 patients with  autism was studied for the occurrence of DISC1  duplications, but no  additional duplications were found. This study is a typical illustration of the difficult interpretation of causal   ity of a rare variant in neuropsychiatric disease.

1007,copy Number Variation in Bipolar Affective Disorder,P09.021,,"Copy number variation (CNV) in the human genome is very common  and may play an important role in disease susceptibility. The role of  CNVs in bipolar disorder (BD) has been largely unknown, in contrast to  other common neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizo   phrenia, where a clear role for CNVs has been established in multiple  publications. The objective of the current study is to determine whether large  (>100kb) and rare (found in <1% of the population) CNVs play a role  in the susceptibility to BD. We performed a genome wide survey for CNVs in 1697 BD patients  and 2806 healthy controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Con   sortium, using the Affymetrix 500K array. The total burden of CNVs was not increased in patients when com   pared with controls. These results are in contrast with those obtained  for schizophrenia patients analysed with the same methods in other  studies, including those in our department, where we found an excess  of CNVs >1Mb in size, when compared to both to the bipolar patients,  or the same group of controls. These results suggest that large rare CNVs may not play a substantial  role in developing BD, unlike their confirmed role in schizophrenia and  autism.

We have investigated, using QMPSF (Quantita   tive Multiplex PCR of Short fluorescent Fragments), 28 candidate loci  previously identified by array CGH studies for gene dosage alteration  in 247 subjects with MR, 260 with ASD, 236 with schizophrenia or  schizoaffective disorder and 236 healthy controls. We show that the  collective frequency of CNVs at these loci is significantly increased in  autistic patients, patients with schizophrenia and patients with MR as  compared with controls (p<0.001, p,0.01 and p,0.001 respectively,  Fisher exact test). Individual significance (p,0.02) was reached for as   sociation between autism and a 350 kb deletion located in 22q11 and  spanning the PRODH gene. These results support the hypothesis that  weakly to moderately recurrent CNVs, either transmitted or occurring  de novo, are causing or contributory factors for these diseases. Sec   ond, we show that most of these CNVs, which contain genes involved  in neurotransmission or synapse formation and maintenance, are pres   ent in the 3 pathological conditions, supporting the existence of shared  biological pathways between these neurodevelopmental disorders.",2009.0,,"A.

Methods: A total of 380 individuals were studied using a diagnostic  protocol based on dysmorphology and clinical assessment. Investiga   tions included a routine karyotype, testing for cryptic chromosomal re   arrangements using FISH and array CGH and DNA testing for FMR1,   MECP2  and other genes as indicated. Results: A specific cause for the mental handicap was identified in 243  individuals (64%). These included a chromosomal abnormality in 86  (22%), fragile X syndrome in 7 (1.8%), Rett syndrome in 9 girls (2.4%),  microdeletion syndrome in 4 (1%), recognizable syndromes in 43  (11%), neurological disorders in 25 (6.6%), metabolic conditions in 3  (0.8%), an environmental cause in 26 (6.8%) and autism spectrum dis   order in 21 (5.5%).

1376,A novel smc1A gene mutation in a male with mild cornelia de  Lange syndrome,P12.048,,"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) (OMIM 122470 and 300590) is  an inherited multisystem developmental disorder characterized by dis   tinctive dysmorphic craniofacial features, growth and cognitive impair   ment and limb malformations. Since 2004, mutations in three genes  (NIPBL, SMC1A and SMC3 ) of the cohesin complex and its regulators  have been found in affected patients. To date, 11 different mutations in  14 unrelated patients have been reported in the X linked  SMC1A gene.  Here, we identified a novel sporadic SMC1A  mutation (p.R711Q) in a  14 month old male who had characteristic but mild facial CdLS ap   pearance, microcephaly, postnatal growth retardation, mild to moder   ate psychomotor delay, mild congenital heart defect (ASD and PDA)  and 2 3 syndactyly in the feet. The mutation altered a highly conserved  residue and was not detected in his parents or in 50 control individu   als. It was located at the SMC coiled coil domain and we hypothesize  that it may affect its angulation within the protein. This case supports  previously published work reporting that patients with mutations in the  SMC1A  gene show a milder physical phenotype, generally without se   vere limb malformations, than patients with mutations in the autosomal  NIPBL gene.

11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,,"People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2   gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth  movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects  of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly  conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and  function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak   ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have  been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2   is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a  complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2  can be used as a unique  window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen   tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of  human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2   gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2  is  itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar   get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.  High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu   tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite  outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2   dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human  speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice.  Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by  altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings  from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions  of FOXP2  to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily  ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and  motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be   gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping  us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between  genes, speech and language.",2010.0,,S.

36,Genomic advances in Schizophrenia,S08.1,,"Recent studies have supported the hypothesis that the high heritabil   ity of schizophrenia reflects a combination of relatively common al   leles of small effect and some rare alleles with relatively large effects.  Genome wide association studies have identified several risk loci at  genome wide levels of significance as well as evidence for a substan   tial burden of common risk loci. Moreover these recent findings sug   gest genetic overlap with bipolar disorder which has traditionally been  assumed to be genetically distinct from schizophrenia. Genome wide  studies of at least one class of relatively uncommon variant, submicro   scopic chromosomal abnormalities often referred to as copy number  variations (CNVs), suggest that these confer high risk of schizophre   nia. There is evidence both for an increased burden of large (>100kb)  and rare (MAF <1%) CNVs in schizophrenia and that risk is conferred  by a number of specific large CNVs (including deletions at 22q11.2,  1q21.1, 15q13.2 and 15q11.2 and duplications of 16p11.2) as well as  by deletions of NRXN1 which encodes the synaptic scaffolding pro   tein neurexin 1.

37,Genome Wide Association Studies in Autism Spectrum  Disorders,S08.2,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a large group of child   hood neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric disorders characterized  by restricted and repetitive patterns of interests and behavior, limited  verbal communication and impairment of social interaction. Several  sources of evidence suggest strong a genetic component in the sus  ceptibility to ASDs; for instance, there are much higher concordance  rates for ASDs in monozygotic twins (92%) than dizygotic twins (10%),  while recent estimates for the sibling recurrence risk is greater than  15. Although ASDs are highly heritable disorders, they exhibit hetero   geneous clinical symptoms and genetic architecture which have hin   dered identification of common genetic susceptibility factors. Although  previous linkage studies, candidate gene association studies and cy   togenetic studies have implicated several chromosomal regions for the  presence of autism susceptibility loci they have failed to consistently  identify genes or genomic loci that increase risk of ASD presentations.  Using the genome wide association study (GWAS) approach, we  have recently identified common genetic variants between two cad   herin genes ( CDH10  and CDH9 ) as associated with ASDs (Wang et  al, Nature , 2009), as well as a collection of rare copy number variants  in neuronal cell adhesion genes (Glessner et al, Nature , 2009).

66,*  Identification of ANKRD11 and ZNF77 as candidate  genes for autism and variable cognitive impairment in the novel  16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome,C02.1,,"Introduction: The clinical utilization of array comparative genomic hy   bridization in the evaluation of patients with intellectual disablity has  recently led to the discovery of a number of novel microdeletion and  microduplication syndromes. Aberrations of chromosome 16q with  clinical relevance have rarely been reported. Interstitial deletions re  stricted to band 16q24.3 have not been reported before Methods: In this study we aimed to characterize the clinical and mo   lecular features of four patients with de novo submicroscopic interstitial  16q24.3 microdeletions ascertained by genome wide array analysis  and to determine the shortest region of overlap (SRO) to identify can   didate genes responsible for their overlapping phenotype Results: Clinical features observed in these patients include facial dys   morphisms comprising prominent forehead, large ears, smooth phil   trum, pointed chin and wide mouth, variable cognitive impairment, au   tism spectrum disorder, structural anomalies of the brain and seizures.  The common region of overlap of the deletions is only 90 kb and com   prises two known genes, Ankyrin Repeat Domain 11  (ANKRD11 ) and  Zinc Finger 778  (ZNF778 ), and is located approximately 10kb distally  to Cadherin 15  (CDH15 ). This region is not found as a copy number  variation in controls. Discussion: We propose that these patients represent a novel and  distinctive microdeletion syndrome, characterized by autism spectrum  disorder, variable cognitive impairment, facial dysmorphisms and brain  anomalies. We suggest that haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11  and/or  ZNF778  contribute to this phenotype and speculate that further inves   tigation of non deletion patients who have features suggestive of this  16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome might uncover other mutations in one  or both of these genes.",2010.0,,"M.

Recent large scale studies of autism and schizo   phrenia have implicated copy number variation in the pathogenesis of  these disorders 1,2. Previously, a 1.3 Mb microdeletion flanked by seg   mental duplications at 2q11.2 was reported in a single patient referred  for CNV profiling, but no phenotypic information was provided 3. We  now report five patients with microdeletions of similar size at this locus  (chr2: ~96.0 to ~97.3 Mb, Hg18). All five patients presented with some  form of neurocognitive deficit: four with developmental delay, three  with autism or autism like features, and two with epilepsy. We found  one further example of this microdeletion in a schizophrenia case in  a publicly available CNV dataset 2. No examples of this deletion were  identified in ~7,500 controls. Notwithstanding that two of the deletions  were inherited from a neurocognitively normal father, (one de novo,  testing of parental samples in the remaining two in progress), this ap   pears to be a very rare but highly penetrant susceptibility locus for  neurocognitive deficit. Six highly homologous (>97%) segmental dupli   cations (SDÃ¢ÂÂs), size 2.5 40 Kb, cluster at the breakpoints.

343,"Duplications of 17q12 q21 in patients with mental  retardation, growth disturbances and facial dysmorphism",P02.123,,"Purpose: In recent years, small genomic rearrangements of 17q12 and  17q21.31 have been described in patients with autism, cognitive im   pairment/ mental retardation, renal disease, epilepsy, and/or growth  retardation. We present three unrelated patients with partially overlap   ping duplications in the 17q12 q21.32 region. Methods: Microarray analysis (Affymetrix SNP_6.0, BAC array, or oligo  array) was performed on purified DNA from peripheral lymphocytes.  FISH analysis was done on cultured lymphocytes according to stan   dard protocols. Results: We identified three unrelated patients with partially overlap   ping de novo  duplications in the 17q12 q21.32 region. All patients were  investigated with genome wide array platforms, showing sizes of the  duplications of 1.5 Mb, 6.6 Mb, and 7.7 Mb respectively. Though the  patients had diverse clinical features as well, all presented with mental  retardation, facial dysmorphism and growth disturbances.

The main clinical features of MASD are dishar   monic dwarfism, micromelia predominating in the lower limbs, severe  brachydactyly, cranio facial dysmorphism, scoliosis, flexion contracture  of knees, and mental retardation. The diagnosis is based on typical  radiographic findings such as cupped metaphyses (Ã¢ÂÂscypho Ã¢ÂÂ comes  from the word Ã¢ÂÂscyphusÃ¢ÂÂ, meaning cup) and cone shaped epiphyses  of long bones, especially appreciable at the knees, coxa valga, genua  vara, short and broad femurs, tibial bowing, mild humeral shortening,  short metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges, and advanced bone  age. We report the case of a 12 year old boy with clinical and radiological  features that are consistent with the diagnosis of MASD (dwarfism,  short limbs with marked acromelic shortness, coxa valga, cup shaped  metaphyses and cone shaped epiphyses of knees, flexion contracture  of knees, cranio facial dysmorphisms, and mental retardation). The  family history was negative for mental retardation, short stature and  other signs suggestive of skeletal dysplasia.

The child suffered from hyponatremia, dehydratation, proteinuria, high  level of glycerol in urine and weak spontaneous mobility. Today, at the  age of 2 years, he also shows mild psychomotor retardation. MLPA analysis of the DMD  gene revealed a deletion of all exons.

489,t wo girls with mental retardation and behavioural  abnormalities: is the deletion of the A tXN1 gene on 6p22.3 a  major factor in causing the phenotype?,P03.065,,"6p22 interstitial deletions are relatively rare, with only eight patients  described so far. The clinical phenotype in these patients includes  developmental delay/mental retardation, defects of brain, heart and  kidney, craniofacial malformations and dysmorphic features. The com   mon deleted region, 2.2 Mb, harbouring 12 genes, has been defined  as critical for this syndrome. ATXN1 , located within this interval, has  been suggested as a candidate gene for the mental retardation based  on its expression in CNS and the cognitive impairments manifested in  knock out mice. We report on two patients carrying partly overlapping  de novo deletions within 6p22.3, which are smaller than the ones pre   viously reported. Patient 1 displays mild mental retardation and behav   ioural problems; her 115 kb deletion (chr6:16215803 16332297, hg19)  encompasses only GMPR  and ATXN1 . Patient 2 has severe mental  retardation, autistic features and hyperactivity. Her deletion spans 2.3  Mb (chr6:14545576 16846846, hg19) and includes JARID2 , DTNBP1   and MYLIP , in addition to GMPR  and ATXN1 . Because the GMP re   ductases encoded by GMPR and GMPR2  have redundant functions,  haploinsufficiency of GMPR  is not likely causing the cognitive impair   ments in our patients. We therefore suggest that ATXN1 hemizygosity  is sufficient to cause the mental retardation in patient 1. Furthermore,  additional genes such as MYLIP , which is expressed in brain and has  been shown to have a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, is expected  to contribute to the significantly more severe phenotype of patient 2.Cytogenetics11",2010.0,,"T.

Array comparative ge   nomic hybridization enables to accurately define the region of interest  and five cases have recently been reported by Bonaglia et al (2008),  allowing them to narrow the minimal critical region to a 4,1 Mb seg   ment. Here we describe three more cases of overlapping 6q16 deletions. By  comparing these deletions with the previously reported 4,1 Mb region,  we define a new minimal deleted fragment of 2,2 Mb (100,489,030   >102,689,000)(hg18 build36) involving four genes: MCHR2  encodes  a receptor for melanin concentrating hormone which is involved in the  control of feeding behaviour and energy metabolism; SIM1  (candidate  gene for obesity), a transcription factor that plays an important role in  the development of the paraventricular neurones; ACSS3 , an helicase;  and GRIK2 , a glutamate receptor which could be involved in autistic  like behaviour. The three patients reported here present a moderate developmental  delay with language retardation. Two of them have also a high weight and even obesity in accordance  with haploinsufficiency of the SIM1 gene, as well as a rounded face  and small extremities. On the contrary, the third patient has an average  weight and normal extremities, but he presents a complex chromosom   al rearrangement with two deletions of the long arm of chromosome 6,  in 6q16.1 and 6q16.2q16.3. Moreover, the deleted chromosome 6 is  involved in a balanced translocation (6 ;13)(q16.1q21).

The SLC9A9 gene has in several studies been associated with  language delay, ADHD and autism. Other genes from the Na+/ H+exchanger family have been associated with epilepsy in mice. A  possible association to epilepsy in humans was shown by Morrow et  al., 2008, who described a family of a mother and 2 sons with a non   sense mutation in the SLC9A9 gene. Both sons had autism, and one  was diagnosed with epilepsy, while the other had had some seizures.  Their mother had speech delay, but neither autism nor epilepsy.

640,A pilot study of Fragile X carrier screening in china,P05.29,,"CGG repeat expansion in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ noncoding region of the FMR1  gene  on the X chromosome is associated with an array of disorders. Large  expansion of over 200 repeats (full mutation) gives rise to the most  common form of inherited mental retardation known as Fragile X Syn   drome (FXS), whereas smaller expansion of 55 200 repeats (premu   tation) is recently shown to be involved in autism, premature ovarian  failure, and fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).  More importantly, the expanded CGG repeats are unstable and can  undergo further expansion on female transmission. Thus, screening  for the unstable FMR1  alleles in asymptomatic women before or at  early pregnancy is an efficient strategy for the prevention of the related  diseases. To evaluate the feasibility of a Fragile X carrier screening pro   gram in china, we anonymously examined 935 Chinese women from  our obstetric clinic for the FMR1  CGG repeats status. DNA analysis  was carried out by an enhanced PCR, coupled with capillary electro   phoresis separation. Inconclusive results were subsequently verified  by Southern analysis. The results showed that 72.5% of the samples  were heterozygous for the FMR1  alleles, 29 and 30 CGG repeats were  the most common alleles. In total, we identified 1 premutation (55 200  CGG repeats) and 9 intermediate expansions (45 54 CGG repeats),  no full mutation was found. The incidence of premutation (1:935) and  intermediate expansion (1:104) in this cohort is comparable to that re   ported in Caucasian population.

Mutations of SH2D1A  are  responsible for the X linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. We present 3 patients from 2 families with complete deletions of the  SH2D1A  gene. The first patient was an 18 year old man with Burkitt Cancer genetics1 lymphoma treated by intensive chemotherapy at the age of 16 followed  by severe aplastic anaemia treated by stem cell transplantation from  his brother. Molecular analysis showed a deletion of all SH2D1A  exons.  His maternal cousin, a 25 year old man with mild learning difficulties,  mild autistic features and severe epidermolysis bullosa like dermatitis  that manifested at the age of 8 years, carried the same deletion. Due  to this atypical phenotype, array CGH was performed to specify the  extent of the deletion. It was about 65 kb long and removed also the 3Ã¢ÂÂ  terminal part of the ODZ1  gene.

947,Identification and characterization of copy number  variations in 50 children with autism,P09.021,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in the first  three years of life. The group of pervasive developmental disorders  (PDDs), also termed autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), includes the  prototypical autism as well as PDD not otherwise specified (PDD), Complex traits and polygenic disorders220 Rett syndrome and AspergerÃ¢ÂÂs disorder. Autism is characterized by  difficulties in managing social interaction and communication, and a  limited, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of reactions and behavior.  ASDs are etiologically heterogenous, and only 10% of the cases are  due to known medical conditions (chromosomal imbalances, genetic  disorders like Fragile X, Rett syndrome or Tuberous sclerosis). The emerge of new high resolution screening methods allows for de   tection of submicroscopic genomic aberrations. One of these methods;  microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) offers  the possibility of detecting copy number variations (CNVs, deletions or  duplications) associated with autism. We present the results of applying aCGH for identification of causal  CNVs in 50 children diagnosed with autism.

948,common variants in cadherin 10 gene show  association with autism spectrum disorders in Finnish  population,P09.022,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are severe neurodevelopmental  disorders that are highly heritable, but phenotypic and genetic het   erogeneity have made it challenging to identify predisposing variants  across populations. Although 10 20% of ASD cases are known to be  caused by rare high penetrance mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities,  and de novo DNA copy number variation, genome wide association  studies (GWAS) with large sample sizes have also revealed common  genetic variants associated with ASDs. Recently, several candidate  genes have been shown in independent studies to be associated with  ASDs in different populations. To test for association between ASDs  and genetic variants in these genes in the Finnish founder popula   tion, we have genotyped 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  in eight candidate genes in families with autism (n,142) or Asperger  syndrome (AS; n,121) and performed association analyses.

Since some  CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs  phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini   cal significance of de novo  and inherited CNVs containing genes being  transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive   ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were  grouped into four categories. First, de novo  CNVs in families with both  parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from  a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely  to be causally related to ASD. The genes in these two categories par   ticipate in pathways probably associated with ASD, such as contactin  based cell communication ( CNTN5 , CNTN6 ), phosphoinositol signaling  (PIK3CA ), and regulation of neurotransmitter levels ( KCNMB4 , TPH2 ).  The de novo  CNVs found in patients with at least one parent scoring  higher than 1 SD above the mean on the SRS, and the CNVs inher   ited from an unaffected parent, while the other parent has an elevated  SRS score, are likely to exert a minor contribution to the phenotype.  Our analysis also indicates that in 6 out of 48 ASD patients two or more  genetic etiologies may be involved.

More recently, the focus of CNV research has mi   grated to detection of rare variants, with an allelic frequency of less  than 5% (Conrad 2009, Manolio 2009). In an effort to increase detec   tion of rare variants as well as more common CNVs, we sought to  develop the highest density oligo array available for CNV detection, as  well as a more sensitive algorithm for CNV detection on NimbleGen  arrays. The NimbleGen 2.1M and 3x720K CNV arrays contain empirically op   timized probes, with the most comprehensive collection of targeted re   gions available, including Asian population specific CNV regions.

The increased  sensitivity of CNV detection was aided by an improved segmentation  algorithm (segMNT), included in NimbleScan v2.6 software.

Rare CNVs have been re   ported as a frequent cause of neurological disorders such as mental  retardation (MR), schizophrenia and autism, prompting widespread  implementation of CNV screening in diagnostics. In previous stud   ies we have shown that, in contrast to CNVs found in the general  population, MR associated CNVs are significantly enriched in genes  whose mouse orthologues, when disrupted, result in a nervous system  phenotype. We have developed and validated a novel computational  method (GeCCO) that differentiates between benign and MR associ   ated CNVs using genomic features to annotate each CNV. This meth   od is able to achieve a high accuracy when classifying a cohort of  individuals with unexplained MR (~1,800). We demonstrate the benefit  of applying such computational methods to the interpretation of CNVs, including those for which the inheritance cannot be determined, as  well as rare inherited CNVs.

Here we discuss on: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Rett syn   drome (RTT), Prader Willi/Angelman syndromes (PWS/AS) and mi   crodeletion syndromes (MDS). The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2,  CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used  to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn   dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes.  Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the  FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected.  The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta   tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect   ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/AS revealed 64% mutations  along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS  revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren  and Wolf Hirschhorn syndromes. Altogether, we manage to clarify the  molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The  percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients,  PWS/AS and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good  clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the  percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low.  Most probably this is due to the characteristics of this group, being  clinically mixed and containing some definite autistic cases.

Introduction: The most common form of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth  disease (CMT) is type 2A, caused by mutations in mitochondrial GT   Pase mitofusin 2 (MFN2).  Objective: To establish the incidence of MFN2 mutations in a cohort of  Spanish patients with axonal CMT neuropathy.  Material and Methods: We studied 85 families with suspected axo   nal CMT. All MFN2 exons were studied through direct sequencing. A  bioenergetics study in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy  taken from a patient with an Arg468His mutation.  Results: Twenty four patients from 14 different families were identified  with nine different MFN2 mutations. MFN2 mutations were responsible  for CMT2 in 16% ÃÂ± 7.7% of the families studied and in 30.8% ÃÂ± 14.2%  (12/39) of families with known dominant inheritance. The Arg468His  mutation was the most prevalent (6/14 families). A bioenergetics study  in fibroblasts was conducted using a skin biopsy taken from a patient  with this mutation. These bioenergetic studies showed the typical re   sults of MFN2 patients.  Conclusion: The Arg468His mutation is the most prevalent (6/14 fami   lies) mutation in MFN2 causing CMT2A in Spanish patients and our  study confirmed that it is actually pathological, presenting as a neu   ropathy in a mild to moderate degree.",2010.0,,"T.

1501,A 134 kb duplication 0.5 mb upstream of sOX9  associated with hermaphroditism in an XX male and autism in  his XY brother,P12.200,,"In a sibship of six a 46,XX male hermaphrodite with ovotestes and no  detectable SRY sequence had a brother with infantile autism without  mental retardation. Both brothers had inherited an identical 134 Kb  duplication of the regulatory genomic region 0.5 Mb upstream of SOX9  from their mother. In another brother who had inherited the same ma   ternal SOX9 haplotype, no upstream duplication was found, proving  that the mother was a gonadal mosaic for the duplication. We hypoth   esize that the duplication caused sufficient SRY independent SOX9  expression in the undifferentiated fetal gonads to promote testicular  development. Apparently, this effect was tissue  and/or fetal specific as  no SOX9 expression was detectable in leukocytes and skin fibroblasts  from any of the siblings. The observations in the family also suggest  that such a SOX9 regulatory region duplication may predispose for  autism in the presence of a Y chromosome, i.e. a SRY gene. This hy   pothesis is supported by the SOX9 segregation pattern which as a less  than 8,2 % probability of being a random event, and the unexplained  general excess of autistic features in males. We therefore propose that  an additional role of SOX9, directly linked to testicular differentiation,  could be the promotion of male specific brain development. Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders ",2010.0,,"A.

However, systematic data regarding late onset disorders are lacking.A cohort (N,41) of unselected carriers, that were detected prenatally in the period 1970 2008, was identified in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Register. Using information from national medical registries, we compared morbidity in the cohort to that of a 5:1 matched control group (N,205). Carriers were offered clinical re examination, analysis  with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array, and breakpoint mapping with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Mate pair Analysis.We observed no serious congenital malformations in the cohort. However, the risk of neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders, including mental retardation, learning disabilities, attention and/or behavioral disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and mood disorders, was significantly elevated (19.5% vs. 8.3% among the controls, p,0.04). Analysis for copy number variants >100 kb did not provide prognostic information about late onset disorders. So far Mate  pair sequencing indicate that many affected carriers have complex rearrangements and/or rearrangements that truncate brain expressed genes, including genes known to be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.Our study demonstrated that prenatally detected de novo  balanced chromosomal rearrangements have high risk of late onset neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders but are not associated with congenital malformations.

Functional considerations and empirical data from animal models  suggest that most gene defects are inherited as recessive traits. However, research into recessive disorders has lagged behind because in Western societies with their small size families, most affected patients are isolated cases. Intellectual disability (ID) is a  particularly important problem of health care world wide, and most severe forms have a genetic etiology. Autosomal recessive forms of ID (ARID) are thought to be more frequent than X linked ones, particularly in developing countries where parental consanguinity is common and the incidence of ID is significantly elevated.Here we report on the first systematic attempt to shed more light on the molecular causes of ARID. By performing homozygosity mapping, exon enrichment and next generation sequencing (NGS), we have identified apparently causative gene defects in 72 out of 130 consanguineous  families from Iran and elsewhere. In 26 families, causative changes were found in previously described disease genes. In three of these genes, i.e. AHI1, SRD5A3 and PRKCG, allelic mutations were found in more than one family. In 46 families, single apparently causative mutations were detected in genes not hitherto implicated in ID or related disorders such as autism, epilepsy or schizophrenia. Many of these genes are involved in (the regulation of) transcription and translation or other regulatory pathways known to be important for brain function, while others interact directly with known ID genes. Thus, the systematic identification of novel ID genes is also a potent strategy to unravel the pathways and pathogenetic mechanisms underlying cognitive disorders.",2011.0,,"H. Najmabadi1, H. Hu2, M.

164, Haploinsufficiency of microRNA 137 is associated with intellectual disability in patients with overlapping deletions in 1p21.3.,C15.6,,"Introduction: Genome wide array technologies have led to the identification of several microdeletion and microduplication syndromes and genes involved in intellectual disability (ID). Microdeletions and/or duplications restricted to chromosomal region 1p21.3 have rarely been reported before. Several ID syndromes have been linked to  the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, but there are no previous reports of genome wide array studies that have led to the identification of miRNAs associated with ID.Methods: We characterized the clinical and molecular features of three sibs and 2 non related patients with overlapping 1p21.3 deletions, detected by genome wide array analysis. The deletions in the two unrelated patients were de novo. We determined the shortest region of  overlap (SRO) to identify candidates for the phenotype.Results: Clinical features comprised mild ID and autism spectrum  disorder. The SRO was 1.22 Mb and included one annotated gene, DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency), which was unlikely to cause the phenotype, since no associated metabolic defect was detected. Interestingly, the SRO also comprised microRNA 137 (miR 137), which was shown to be under epigenetic regulation of MeCP2 and involved in adult neurogenesis in previous studies in  mice. Our patients had a significantly altered expression of miR 137 and downstream targets. Furthermore, in mouse synaptosomes we  found significant enrichment of miR 137 at the synapse as assessed by qRT PCR, suggesting a role for miR 137 as a modulator of local translation at the synapse.Conclusion: We propose that these patients represent a novel  microdeletion syndrome that is caused by haploinsufficiency of miR  137.",2011.0,,"M.

178, Genetic causes of pervasive developmental disorders,P01.02,,"The pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), or autism spectrum  disorders (ASD), range from a severe form, called autistic disorder, to a milder form, Asperger syndrome.This paper will focus on classic autism and Asperger syndrome, intending to review the current understanding of the etiologies and the  multiple pathogenetic pathways that are likely to lead to the autistic phenotype. Like mental retardation, autism is likely to be caused by many different genetic mechanisms and genes rather than a single, or few, major genes or environmental effects. Applying routine genetic testing in clinical (CLIA certified) diagnostic laboratories itÃ¢ÂÂs possible to identify the specific etiology and recurrence risk in 10% to 15% of autism cases and is clinically indicated for any child with autism.In this study we report 5 cases with different genetic syndromes in which ASD has been described as one of the possible manifestations:  Down syndrome, 22q13 deletion, ,,cri du chatÃ¢ÂÂ syndrome   5p15 deletion, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Sotos syndrome. c onclusions : The etiologies of ASD are complex and presence of a  wide variety cytogenetic abnormalities are providing us with extremely  valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism and collaboration with psychiatrists.

The low copy repeats spanning the region 1q21.1 mediate nonallelic homologous recombinations that result in rearrangements of 1q21.1. Recent data suggest that a recurrent 1,35 Mb microduplication on chromosome 1q21.1 predisposes to autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay and mental retardation. Other clinical features include macrocephaly, hypertelorism and a wide range of congenital anomalies. Variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance and non specific phenotypic features associated with 1q21.1 microduplication complicate genetic diagnosis and counselling.We report on two unrelated girls of two and three years old, presenting with developmental delay and similar facial dysmorphism such as  hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, short nose with anteverted nostrils, prominent philtrum and thin upper lip. Head circonferences were in normal ranges.

FS are the most common type of epilepsy in childhood, with an incidence rate of 2 14%. If febrile seizures persist after six years old, they are considered as an epileptic syndrome named GEFS+, a rare familiar  disease that arises as FS and progresses to generalized epilepsy in adults. GEFS+ presents an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of epileptic phenotypes whose acuteness varies from mild to severe.It is well known that the gene coding the ÃÂ± 1 sodium channel subunit (SCN1A) is mutated in GEFS+ patients; moreover it has been recently suggested as a possible susceptibility locus for FS. We investigated the involvement of SCN1A in a group of GEFS+ and FS families by means of mutation analysis. The study indentified two missense mutations (R542Q and T297I) in highly conserved regions of the  channel together with several known SNPs. The R542Q is a de novo mutation already known to be associated with both autism and myoclonic epilepsy, while the T297I, previously associated with SMEI, was identified in all affected members of a family showing FS.Functional studies aimed at evaluating the effect of these mutations on the physiological properties of the channel are currently in progress.

The unbalanced rearrangements are not common; however, have significant clinical expression. The parental balanced translocation produces unbalanced  chromosome, which is eventually transmitted to next generation through fertilization of gametes carrying the derivative chromosome. The carriers of balanced rearrangements mostly do not have recognizable phenotypic expression. We report a family comprising of healthy and non consanguineous young parents and their primi newborn severely affected with multiple congenital anomalies and systemic disorders. Conventional G banding analysis of somatic chromosomes identified a balanced translocation, t(6;10)(p23;q24) in mother and an unbalanced rearrangement, der(6),t(6:10)(p23;q24)mat in the child. The child has  inherited a derivative chromosome 6 with partial deletion of 6 (p23 pter) and partial trisomy 10(q24 qter), which has obviously resulted in fusion of genes of two different chromosomes. The prominent phenotypic features of del(6p), including high forehead, flat nasal bridge, agenesis of left year, atrio septal defect (ASD), craniosynostosis and growth retardation were overlapping with specific Axenfeld Reiger  , Larsen   and Ritscher Sinzel/3 C syndromes; however, lacking in ocular anomalies, skeletal laxity or cerebellar malformation.

These rearrangements are associated with abnormal head size, mental retardation, autism and congenital anomalies. Most often, microdeletions and  duplications of 1q21.1 occur de novo. We  describe a large family with a 1q21.1 microduplication. m ethods & Results: The proband is the first child of non  consanguineous Dutch parents. Prenatal ultrasound revealed an  enlarged heart with a ventricular septal defect and wide aortic and pulmonary arteries. After pregnancy termination, external morphologic examination demonstrated a proportioned fetus with a round face, hypertelorism and short palpebral fissures. Autopsy showed a grossly enlarged heart, perimembranous ventricular septal defect,  absent pulmonary valve, dysplastic tricuspid valve, persistent left superior vena cava and abnormally wide and thickened wall of the ascending aorta. Genome wide SNP array analysis on DNA from cultured amniocytes revealed a 1q21.1 microduplication of 2.2 Mb. This microduplication was also found in the mother, who presented with mild mental retardation. Subsequently, this rearrangement was detected in 9 family members. All displayed dysmorphic features including hypertelorism and macrocephaly. Normal development was present in most 1q21.1 microduplication carriers.Discussion: Congenital heart malformations have been reported in  4/26 patients with 1q21 duplication from two large cohorts [Mefford 2008, Brunetti Pierri 2008], including ventricular septal defects and univentricular heart.

We present here genetic study on an 18 years old male investigated for severe mental retardation associated with dismorphic features,  limb anomalies, cadiac and renal malformations. Conventional cytogenetics: abnormal chromosome 2, with additional material on the long arm, add(2q). The banding pattern of abnormal chromosome suggested that the additional segment 2q belongs to telomeric short arm, or telomeric long arm of chromosome 4. WCP4 probe was used and hybridized to the additional region of derivative chromosome 2. For differentiation, in addition a telomeric 4p probe was used, which did not hybridise to the segment attached to the long arm of the derivative chromosome 2.

Speech delay was found in 5/6 patients, with dysarthry in 3/6, mental retardation in 4/6 patients, ASD phenotype in 3/6 patients, mild non specific dysmorphism (3/6) with prominent ear lobes in 2/6 patients, normal growth parameters with macrocephaly in 1/6 patient and microcephaly in 1/6.

One patient is a 5 year old boy affected with high functioning autism, mild MR, obesity and speech delay. The second case is a 4 year old boy suffering from mild MR, microcephaly, speech delay and chorioretinitis. Karyotyping revealed a normal karyotype in both patients. SNP array analysis (Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12) demonstrated in both cases identical ~800 kb deletions of 15q25.2 q25.3 (chr15:82.7 83.5Mb (hg18)) flanked by low copy repeats (LCRs). The deletions are adjacent to recurrent 15q25.2 deletions associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, cognitive  deficits and Diamond Blackfan anemia which are also flanked by LCRs. Chromosome 15q25.2 q25.3 has been predicted to be a hotspot for rearrangements based on its genomic architecture predisposing Cytogenetics137 to non allelic homologous recombination.

Expressive language is absent or very poor and  often echolalic. Epilepsy with a wide variety of seizures, as a typical Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), can occur in these individuals.

It has also been found in controls and healthy relatives of affected individuals. The reason for this wide phenotypical variability is poorly understood. On the contrary, homozygous deletions  of this same area have so far been reported in only 4 patients and seem to be linked with a specific clinical presentation, namely severe mental retardation, seizures and visual impairment.The 12 year old female patient was born at term with normal growth parameters. Absent visual pursuit was noticed at 2 months and congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) was diagnosed at 9 months by electroretinography. At 10 months, severe developmental delay was evident and seizures were noticed. High myopia ( 10 dioptries) is known since the age of 21 months. Karyotype, methylation  of the AS/PWS region and MECP2 analysis were normal. Array CGH (Agilent 244K) revealed a homozygous 1.5 Mb 15q13.3 deletion (28719136 3029809 bp, UCSC Hg19). The deleted interval comprises 6 genes: MTMR15, MTMR10, KLF13, OTUD7A, CHRNA7, TRPM1. A homozygous mutation of TRPM1 has been recently associated with CSNB and myopia (Audo et al., AJHG 2009; 85: 720 729). The asymptomatic parents are both heterozygous carriers.This report confirms that the clinical picture of homozygous 15q13.3 deletions is very homogeneous and comprises, besides severe mental retardation and seizures, CSNB with myopia as a key feature.

591, Know how to recognize and appropriately follow up a recombinant pericentric inversion detected by array c GH,P03.073,,"Nowadays, array based analysis is the first diagnostic tool to examine  patients with mental retardation and congenital anomalies. If a genetic imbalance is observed and confirmed by karyotyping and/or FISH, parents are usually analysed with FISH using probes localized in the unbalanced regions to exclude a balanced rearrangement. This  is needed to assess the risk for further children with an unbalanced chromosome complement and to provide prenatal diagnostic options.We present a 20 year old male patient with severe developmental delay and autism. Array CGH analysis revealed a terminal gain of 1.07 Mb of 18p11.32 and a terminal loss of 16.8 Mb of 18q21.33q23. The terminal deletion 18q, also known as DeGrouchy syndrome, explained the phenotype in our patient. At this point, parental chromosome studies were offered but denied. Recently, we received amniotic fluid of the sister in law of our proband, because of ultrasound abnormalities. Cytogenetics148 Chromosome analysis showed an abnormal chromosome 18,  suggesting an unbalanced 18;18 translocation with extra 18q material on terminal 18p. After karyotyping, the prospective father and paternal grandfather proved to be carriers of an inv(18)(p11.32q21.33). Consequently, the fetus and the proband exhibited each a different  recombinant chromosome 18. The paternal pericentric inversion would remain unrecognized when FISH with probes from the abnormal regions was performed.In conclusion, the concomitant gain and loss of the terminal long and short arm of the same chromosome at array diagnostics should alert to a recombinant pericentric inversion.

He presents behavioral disorders as depression, impulsivity, hyperactivity and relationships difficulties with other children. EEG shows epilepsy. He uses short sentences but with pronunciations difficulties.  Developmental quotient was evaluated at 63 (Terman Merrill). Minor dysmorphic features were observed with upslanting palpebral fissures, strabismus, mild retrognathia and protruding upper lip with long philtrum. Growth parameters at 7 years are in the normal range.CGH analysis showed a 2.015 Mb deletion distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. The deletion is maternally inherited. The family belongs to underprivileged socio cultural environment with relatives presenting learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities. Given this blurring familial situation, this deletion was initially considered as being  of unknown clinical significance. Furthermore polymorphic CNV were reported in this region.Two publications (Edelmann et al., 2007 ; J Med Genet 44:136 143 and Ramocki et al., 2010 ; Am J Hum Genet 87:857 865) reported  deletions or duplications distal to the Williams Beuren deletion. These patients exhibit variable expression of epilepsy, learning difficulties, intellectual disabilities (mild to severe developmental delay or intellectual disability with autistic features in some patients) and/or neurobehavioral abnormalities (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity and aggression including self abusive behavior and depression). The majority of the patients have a deletion inherited from a normal or less affected parent. HIP1 and YWHAG genes are also deleted in our patient.

In contrast, the case reported herein represents mosacism manifesting as 46,X,idic(X)(p11.2)/46,XX without Turner syndrome phenotype and without a cell with 45,X karyotype. In average, 46,X,idic(X)(p11.2) was detected  in 10% of cells. The latter was found using multiprobe FISH on 350 metaphase plates and 1000 interphase nuclei. The structure of idic(X) was determined by FISH, as well. BrdU replication banding showed consistent inactivation of idic(X) in all affected cells. Phenotypic features referred to autistic and aggressive behavior (including self mutilation), severe developmental delay, lack of speech, mild microcephaly, abnormal pigmentation and mild facial dysmorphisms. Taking into account the severity of the phenotype and the amount of abnormal cells, we came to a conclusion that the index case is  likely to be associated with an X linked mutation and X chromosome isodisomy. To support this hypothesis, we have analyzed length of (CGG)n and (CAG)n repeat expansions of FMR1 and AR genes, respectively, using methyl sensitive restriction and QPCR, which showed the same parental origin of chromosomes X. Therefore, X chromosome isodisomy and an X linked mutation are most likely to explain phenotypic manifestations in the index case. Looking through the available literature, we concluded that this is the first reported case  of mosaicism involving idic(X)(p11.2) without 45,X cell line. Finally, this case shows that such mosaicism is a karyotypic marker of X chromosome isodisomy and X linked mutations as well as supports association of autism with mosaic X chromosome aneuploidy.",2011.0,,"A.

Here, we test the hypothesis that genomic variation in concert with the trisomy 21 determines the risk for CHD. This case control GWAS includes 156 DS without CHD and 192 DS with CHD  (AVSD,72, ASD,53, VSD,67). Trisomic and disomic SNPs were called separately. Trisomic single locus association reveals 4 SNPs as CHD risk alleles (Bonferroni adjusted p values < 0.05). One of these SNPs was also identified as a risk factor for AVSD+VSD combined (p,0.008), while a 5th SNP was identified as risk factor for ASD (p, 0.002) and AVSD+ASD combined (p,0.05). No significant signal was identified from the non chr21 GWAS. We then performed a 2 locus genomewide analysis. A significant interaction signal was observed between loci on chr5 and chr6 (p,0.002). Since DS is likely to be a  disorder of gene expression, we focused on 2 locus interactions using only eQTLs. Interestingly, 2 locus model analysis on chr21 eQTLs reveals an interaction between eQTLs for PDE9A and WDR9 genes and eQTLs for C21orf56 and C21orf57 genes.Furthermore, the 2 locus analysis of non chr21 eQTLs identifies an interaction between eQTLs for CLCNKA on chr1 and USMG5 on chr10 (p,0.01). A search for chr21 risk CNVs for AVSD using tiling 135K chr21 array did not show any significant risk variation.

1099, A long non coding RNA accounts for Angelman syndrome like neurodevelopmental disorder,P09.018,,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder  characterized by severe mental retardation and autistic like features. AS is due to lack of UBE3A gene expression, but in 15% of the cases the molecular cause still remains unknown. Long non coding RNAs (lncRNA) constitute a large portion of the human transcriptome,  which regulates gene expression by different mechanisms, including splicing, translational repression and epigenetic regulation. The spatial and temporal expression of lncRNA appears to be extremely important for the development and function of the central nervous system. Our study is focused on an AS like patient with an unusual combination of a deletion that involves lncRNA AK097590 inherited from one parent, and a rare SNP within AK097590 inherited from the other parent. Besides, this SNP leads to a change in the predicted secondary structure of AK097590 that may affect its normal function. We have  performed AK097590 knock down experiments in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. qPCR assays have demonstrated that a decrease of AK097590 levels is sufficient to modify the expression of UBE3A, PRKCG and PPP2R1A. Interestingly, these genes have a role in synaptic plasticity and long term depression, which are reduced in AS murine models. Our results suggest that changes in the expression levels of AK097590 may contribute to the clinical features associated to AS, offering a novel molecular basis for the cases non associated with mutations in UBE3A. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanism of AK097590 lncRNA and its target genes may help in the development of therapeutic strategies for these neurodevelopmental disorders.",2011.0,,"S.

In a recent GWA of autism we identified a strong association within the gene MACROD2 (1). Very little is known about the function of MACROD2. This project is structured to examine the biological role of MACROD2, with the hypothesis that disruption of MACROD2 will impact on the structure and/or function of the neuron.ResultsMACROD2 is expressed almost ubiquitously across human tissues, including brain, kidney, placenta, skeletal muscle, testis and thyroid gland. Promoter mapping constructs were examined in SHSY5Y  neuroblastoma cell lines. We observed differential expression of the various promoter lengths. From this preliminary data it would appear that the promoter region of MACROD2 lies ~500bp upstream from exon 1.DiscussionGWA offer potential insight into the biology of disease. The biological characterisation of observed candidate genes must follow GWA to best take advantage of these data.This preliminary work is part of a wider comprehensive study of MACROD2 which will include both in silico and in vitro techniques.The authors acknowledge grant support from the HRB.References1.

After stringent quality control measures, we compared 3K cases to over 19K ethnically matched controls in a two stage genome wide association design. In all, we uncovered 275 statistically significant distinct copy number variable regions. The 60 genes nearest these robust CNVRs are most enriched in gene networks impacting neurological disease, behavior and developmental disorder. A more focused analysis of a subset of 87 CNVRs that are predicted to disrupt 26 genes highlights GABA receptor signaling, and methionine/glutathione trans sulfuration as the most significant canonical pathways disrupted in ASD. Furthermore, we used available family members to characterize CNVRs into inherited vs de novo and used ethnicity information to characterize their effects in different ethnic populations.

1118,Identification of four mutations affecting normal splicing during the resequencing of X chromosome synaptic genes in individuals with autism or schizophrenia,P09.037,,"Autism (AUT) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are two common  neurodevelopmental disorders, which result from the combination of genetic and environmental factors. To explore the hypothesis that rare highly penetrant mutations in different genes specific to single families are involved in these diseases, we have resequenced X linked synaptic  genes in a cohort of 285 AUT and SCZ individuals and identified truncating mutations in IL1RAPL1 and MAOB genes (Piton A, Mol. Psy., 2010). We wanted to evaluate if, besides these two mutations, some of the rare variants could have such a drastic effect at the protein level by affecting the mRNA splicing. We used an in silico approach (using Human Splicing Finder, Nnsplice, SpliceView, ESEfinder, Rescue ESE) to detect which of the rare variants could create/disrupt an acceptor site, a donor site or an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). Fourteen variants with the best prediction scores were tested in vitro  using a minigene system in the vector SPL3B. We showed that four of these variants (28%), in GABRQ, GABRA3, HDAC6 and NXF5 genes, affect the normal splicing and are predicted to lead to truncated proteins. Our results illustrate the importance of analyzing the effect of mutations at the mRNA level and have led to the identification of new genes associated with AUT.

GWAS rely upon statistically robust genome  wide significant associations to identify genes and loci of risk. There are considerable modest association signals that do not meet stringent genome wide significance thresholds. These signals may conceal underlying patterns that are important to understanding the aetiology Complex traits and polygenic disorders275 of disease. We have developed a robust method, pedSNP ratio test  (pedSRT) to examine association enrichment in biologically linked gene sets for family based association studies. Using a two stage approach we explore association enrichment in GWA data from more than 2100 families from the Autism Genome Project. Based on estimates  from study sensitive simulation we identify excess of observed and replicated association enrichment. We highlight enrichment for sets of genes involved in diverse biological processes including pyruvate metabolism, transcription factor activation and cell signalling. Many of the genes and processes that show enrichment have previously been examined in autistic disorders and offer biologically plausibility to these findings. Moreover, our data supports the hypothesis, that in part, common variation is important in the aetiology of ASDs.

1120," AKAPs integrate genome wide association findings for autism spectrum disorders into signalling networks regulating steroidogenesis, neurite outgrowth and synaptic function",P09.039,,"Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly heritable.  In recent years, several genome wide association studies (GWAS) of ASD were published. Methods: We have carried out a bioinformatics analysis using Ingenuity and a systematic literature analysis of 200 genes from five  published GWAS that yielded association with ASD through single nucleotide polymorphisms at P < 0.0001, and we used the results from a sixth published GWAS to validate our findings. We also searched for overlap between the identified candidate genes and genes located in copy number variations (CNVs) in people with ASD and we identified microRNAs that downregulate gene expression of ASD candidate genes and are deregulated in ASD.Results: A total of 120 of the 200 ASD candidate genes encode proteins that fit into three signalling networks regulating steroidogenesis,  neurite outgrowth and synaptic function, and we were able to place 50 other ASD candidate genes in the identified networks. The proteins encoded by 11 ASD linked AKAP (A kinase anchor protein) genes functionally integrate signalling cascades within and between these networks. Lastly, we found that 70 of the 200 ASD candidate genes were found in CNVs in people with ASD and 100 of these genes were downregulated by ASD implicated microRNAs.ConclusionsWe have identified three signalling networks for ASD that contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of the disorder and that are functionally integrated by the AKAPs, Ã¢ÂÂdruggableÃ¢ÂÂ proteins that need to be further investigated as possible targets for psychopharmacological treatments of ASD.",2011.0,,"G.

We describe a family where brother and sister show mild intellectual disability, behavior abnormalities and epilepsy, with normal brain imaging and no major dysmorphic features. Karyotype is normal, as well FMR1 analysis in the male patient. Their mother, who died of cancer at 48 years of age, and a maternal aunt are both reported  to have behavioral abnormalities, mild intellectual disability, but no seizures. Two maternal uncles are healthy.In both patients, array CGH analysis revealed a 250 kb deletion of chromosome 7q31.32 encompassing one single gene, CADPS2. The father does not carry the deletion, indicating likely maternal inheritance. The deletion was excluded in one of the maternal uncles.CADPS2 is a calcium binding protein that regulates the exocytosis of synaptic and dense core vesicles in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. CADPS2 is a candidate gene for autistic disorders, since it maps in the  autism susceptibility region AUTS1 on chromosome 7q31.32, which alsocorresponds to a candidate region for mood disorders. Knock out mice show an autistic like phenotype and some ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) patients show a possible defect in CADPS2 splicing. We performed, therefore, a mutation screening in 46 individuals with ASD and in 34 patients with intellectual disability who did not carry any genomic rearrangement as far as array CGH analysis could detect.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) ranks among the top ten causes of  global burden of disease. To our knowledge, only one systematic CNV screening of patients with MDD has been carried out. We performed a genome wide analysis of CNVs in 575 German patients with a DSM IV diagnosis of MDD and 1,618 controls. We genotyped all individuals  using either IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs HumanHap550, Human610 or Human660W arrays. To identify potential CNVs, we analyzed each individualÃ¢ÂÂs SNP chip information with QuantiSNP and PennCNV. To minimize the number of false positive CNV calls, we developed a stringent quality protocol, requiring CNVs to have a minimum of 30 consecutive SNPs and a confidence value of at least 30. The two datasets generated by QuantiSNP and PennCNV were analyzed separately. Only those regions for which both programs generated nominal significant P values were included in further analyses. We discovered a significant overrepresentation of CNVs in four different chromosomal regions (7p21, 15q26, 16p11.2, 18p11) in patients compared to controls. To our knowledge, CNVs in 7p21, 15q26, and 18p11 have not been described in MDD or other psychiatric disorders.

1315,PON1 phenotype and gene polymorphisms in children with autism,J09.01,,"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology.  Many genetic and environmental factors are incriminated in its pathogenesis. Subacute exposure to organophosphates (OPs) during critical periods of prenatal neurodevelopment is one of the factors that may trigger autism. Human serum paraoxonase (PON1)  is a HDL associated hydrolase, which in addition to hydrolyzing the OPs, plays a physiological role in reducing LDL oxidation. The PON1 gene shows two functional polymorphisms: M55L and Q192R. These polymorphisms influence the concentration and activity of PON1 towards different substrates, including OPs.The gene environment interaction is tested in the present study by assessing the distribution and frequency of M55L and Q192R polymorphisms in 58 autistic children and 43 controls.No significant difference (p>0.05) in genotypes distribution was found  between autistic patients and controls (QQ 51.72%, QR 43.1%, RR 5.17% / MM 12.1%, ML 60.3%, LL 27.6% for autistic group and QQ 51.16%, QR 44.18%, RR 4.65% / MM 9.3%, ML 53.5%, LL 37.2% for control group).Although, the paraoxonase activity did not present a significant difference between the patients and controls (p>0.05), there was a significant activity increase in the autistic groups with R allele number and both in autistic and control groups with L allele number (p<0.05). The arylesterase activity was significantly decreased (p<0.05) in autistic patients, with no relation to the number of R alleles, but increased in relation with L allele number (p<0.05).These results provide support for the hypothesis that PON1 arylesterase activity could represent a biochemical/genetic test in  estimating autism risk.",2011.0,,"E.

The common deleted region extends from genomic location 29.4 31.1Mb and its flanked by low copy repeats. A deletion of the adjacent region has been also described in a boy with mental retardation and his father with learning disabilities. We  present an additional case with the same atypical 16p11.2 deletion and speculate about its possible pathogenic effect.The girl showed facial dysmorphic features, congenital malformations (aortic valve defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum and uretero vesical reflux), moderate severe mental retardation and speech disorder. She carried a de novo balanced (1;17)(q21;q23) translocation,  observed by conventional karyotype. Genome wide oligonucleotide arrays studies detected a 289kb deletion (location 28.73 29.02Mb), flanking the recurrent 16p11.2 microdeletion/duplication region. The  deletion was confirmed by FISH studies and ruled out in both parents. Translocation breakpoints, located at 1q11.1 (a non containing gene region) and 17q23.1.q23.2, did not present genomic imbalances. It has been shown that around 30% of cases with apparently balanced reciprocal translocations and abnormal phenotype present genomic rearrangements in other chromosomes. We, therefore, hypothesis that the atypical deletion of 16p11.2, present in our patient and previously reported in two cases with intellectual disabilities, may have a pathogenic effect, either as a primary cause or as a contributing factor to the phenotype. Further investigations to rule out the possibility of gene disruption within 17q23 region and characterization of additional cases with 16p11.2 deletions are needed to fully understand the role of this rearrangement.",2011.0,,"M.

Substantial amount of phenotypic differences between healthy individuals have been attributed to CNVs and they also contribute to disease risk in several human disorders including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Dog  breeds as genetic isolates have recently emerged as a new model for human inherited diseases. Hundreds of genetic diseases have been identified in dogs, many of which are similar to human diseases and are likely to have a similar genetic background. CNVs are expected to play a role in several disease conditions in dogs and contribute to breed specific characters. This study aims to map and catalogue CNVs in 50 dogs from 17 breeds (2 10 dogs/breed) and 3 wolves by comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) using NimblegenÃ¢ÂÂs arrays with 2.1 million probes giving a high resolution of approximately 1 kb  median probe spacing across the canine genome. This density gives considerably higher resolution than previously published studies. A Finnish Boxer DNA was used as a reference for other breeds. The results of this high resolution analysis of the CNVs in a large number of breeds provide important discoveries likely to contribute to several phenotypes in dogs and are being followed up in many cohorts available in the European canine genomics effort, LUPA consortium.

1564, Parallel Detection of c opy Number Variation and Loss of Heterozygosity with c GH m icroarrays,P11.159,,", Madison, WI, United States. High resolution array CGH has been widely used to investigate DNA  copy number variation (CNV) associated with complex disorders. Disease association studies have become increasingly focused on CNVs, and several recent reports show links between CNVs and schizophrenia, autism, and cancer, among others. However, many  copy neutral events undetected by conventional array CGH, including copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and uniparental disomy (UPD), also contribute to disease phenotypes. Regions of the genome absent of heterozygosity are usually determined through the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which each parent has contributed a different allele.Until recently, cytogenetic research needing both high resolution, high quality copy number analysis and LOH detection required two separate array platforms. At Roche NimbleGen we have developed  a combination array CGH/LOH detection platform by adding probes that respond to SNPs to existing array CGH designs. Two probes detect each SNP location, including a perfect match probe (A allele) and a mismatch probe (B allele) similar to our comparative genomic sequencing platform. Using our patented probe design strategy, the detection of over 600,000 common SNPs (MAF >0.4) was tested to ensure the best responding SNP probes were added to the array CGH designs. We will show data from a new 6X630K platform that allows high resolution and high sensitivity detection of both CNVs and LOH following the standard CGH workflow.

It has long been known that schizophrenia has high heritability, but as for  other complex disorders, identifying the specific genes responsible has been  a major challenge. However, through the technological revolution in geno  mics, and by the deployment of very large samples through international collaboration, highly significant evidence for the involvement of around 15  common genetic variants has emerged, each making a small contribution to  risk of the disorder. Replication studies suggest that of 81 independent vari ants surpassing p<10 5 in the largest schizophrenia GWAS, the vast majority are likely to be true risk variants but it is also clear from multi locus tests  that around a thousand or more risk variants exist. There is clear evidence  that these common variants substantially overlap with risk variants for bipolar disorder, and emerging evidence that they also overlap with those  conferring risk of other disorders, in particular ADHD. The same develop  ments that have allowed GWAS have also identified a number of abnorma lities of chromosome structure with clear evidence for their involvement in  schizophrenia and that these occur as de novo mutations in about 5% of  cases. Although rare, the CNVs confer a substantial increase in risk of schi   zophrenia to carriers as well as to other neurodevelopmental phenotypes including ADHD, Autism and Intellectual Disability. Although only a small  amount of the total genetic variation that contributes to schizophrenia and  bipolar disorder has been allocated to specific DNA variants, recent findings have strongly implicated specific aspects of neuronal function that are of importance in the pathogenesis of psychosis.",2012.0,,J.

36, De Novo Mutations in Neurodevelopmental disorders,S10.3,,"INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual deficiency (ID) are common, devastating and poorly treated neurodevelopmental brain disorders. The wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical variability in these disorders suggest a complex genetic etiology, which is consistent with the numerous loci thus far identified by linkage, copy number variation and association studies. Although heritability in all three disorders may be as high as ~80%, the genes responsible for much ESHG Concurrent Symposia  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org12 www.eshg.orgof this heritability remain to be identified. Based on the observed redu  ced reproductive fitness, the relatively uniform world wide incidence, the  increased risk of disease with increasing paternal age and the phenotypic  complexity of each disease, we, and others, hypothesized that a fraction of this missing heritability may be the result of the occurrence of de novo mu  tations affecting any of a large number of genes. In order to test this hypo thesis we first sequenced over 400 synaptic genes in 148 subjects with SCZ, 148 subjects with ASD and 96 subjects with ID. Many likely de novo mutati   ons were identified   these plus relevant functional studies will be presen   ted. Next we sequenced the exomes of SCZ, ASD and ID probands, plus their parents, identifying numerous additional de novo mutations (DNMs). In ad  dition, 1/4 of identified DNMs are nonsense mutations, which is more than  what is expected by chance. Interestingly, some of the identified genes, such  as SHANK3, show deleterious de novo mutations in patients from the three  disease cohorts, suggesting close biological overlap in these disorders.

But the extraordinary genetic heterogeneity of ID will render extre mely difficult the determination, for each specific cause (recurrent CNV or mutated gene), of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history, the estimation of penetrance and expressivity variation, and the organization of clinical trials, except for the most frequent causes (see recent work on 16p11.2 del or dup).

This new methodologies have led to identification of novel genomic disorder in patients with developmental delay/mental retardation and/or multiple congenital anomalies (DD/MR/MCA), with a significant increase in diagnostic yield .In this study we present the result of array CGH obtained in 150 children with normal karyotype but DD/MR/MCA. The array CGH 60K from agilent platform was performed.In 34 patients (22,66%) was detected a chromosomal deletion or duplicati   on previously described like pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs),. In 15 cases (10%) was necessary the analysis of parental samples, showing that 6 anomalies (40%) had occurred de novo and was classified as pathogenic and in 9 cases (60%) appeared to be inherited from an unaffected parent. In a total of 40 patients (26,66%) was possible to detect a pathogenic CNVs .Recent studies suggest that when aCGH is performed with an apparently normal karyotype, the diagnostic yield increases by an additional 8 17%. In our study we have obtained a 26,66% of children with pathogenic CNVs that is higher than the results obtained by other authors.

There are close simila rities between autism profiles in idiopathic and comorbid autism (FXS).Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the frequency of serum anti neural antibodies in a group of 23 Fragile X males.Material and methods: Serum anti neuronal antibodies were measured by Western blot technique (Anti neuronal Antigens EUROLINE WB EUROIM   MUN) in 23 patients with FXS (full mutation in the FMR1 gene), aged bet  ween 10 and 32 years, in comparison to 19 healthy matched malesResults: We detected the presence of antibodies in the serum of 10 FXS ma les and in 1 from the reference group. FXS males had significantly higher percent of elevated levels of serum anti neuronal antibodies (43,48%) than healthy controls (5,26%).Conclusion: Serum anti neuronal antibodies were found in a subgroup of FXS patients.

A male with the full mutation is expected to transmit alleles of premuta   tion size to his daughters, based on an experience of less than ten reported  cases. This is why prenatal testing is still recommended for a female fetus  of a fully mutated genitor. Fetal DNA was extracted from cultured amnio cytes and submitted to Southern blotting and (CGG)n PCR analysis. While  the father is mosaic for a methylated full mutation in lymphocytes (around  20% of the cells are not methylated), his wife has two normal alleles. The female fetus harbored a normal allele and a 105 CGG repeats premutation.  She was therefore predicted to be unaffected with Fragile X syndrome and  the pregnancy was pursued. Repeat ultrasound examination of the fetus was normal. After an uneventful pregnancy, the woman gave birth to a healthy female baby. Reproduction in Fragile X males is exceptional.

However, only a few patients  with a microdeletion including the HIP1 gene, located in the distal region  of 7q11.23, have been reported. These patients show a neurodevelopmen tal and epilepsy syndrome. HIP1 encodes huntingtin interacting protein 1  which is normally expressed in the brain. HIP1 knockout mice develop a  progressive neurologic phenotype with tremor and gait ataxia. Therefore, HIP1 haploinsufficiency has been proposed to lead to cognitive and beha vioural dysfunction in these patients.

Recently mutations in ANKRD11  have been documented in patients with KBG syn  drome, and it has been proposed that haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11 is the  cause of this syndrome. In addition, copy number variation in the 16q24.3 region that includes ANKRD11 results in a variable phenotype that overlaps  with KBG syndrome that also includes autism spectrum disorders and other dysmorphic facial features. In this report we present a 2 ÃÂ½ year old African American male with features highly suggestive of KBG syndrome. Genomic microarray identified a 154 kb deletion within ANKRD11 .

The Potocki Lupski syndrome (PTLS, MIM 610883) is a microduplication syndrome caused by a common duplication of about 3,7Mb in 17p11.2. The PTLS associated duplication is reciprocal to the common 17p11.2 deletion syndrome (Smith Magenis syndrome). Both, deletion and duplication rear rangements are caused by nonallelic homologous recombination between flanking repeat gene clusters (Zhang et al. 2010). Clinical features of PTLS  include infantile hypotonia, failure to thrive, mental retardation, autism, be  havioural abnormalities and speech delay.Here we report about two patients with PTLS who were ascertained by ka  ryotyping and array CGH analyses. Patient 1, a 5 year old boy, showed an  uncommon duplication of 4,7Mb. He demonstrated classical features like hypotonia, failure to thrive, mental retardation, speech delay, auto aggres   sive behaviour and facial dysmorphisms, but no congenital malformations.

392, Genetic study of PTEN mutations among individuals with ASDs / MR and macrocephaly,P02.213,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of severe neurodevelopmen tal conditions among which pervasive developmental disorder (not other   wise specified) and autistic disorder are the most common. The prevalence of ASDs is currently estimated at 60 and 13 per 10,000 for ASDs and autism, respectively. Autistic disorder is often associated with macrocephaly; 24%  of patients have head circumference (HC) at >98th centile. Mutations in the  PTEN gene have been reported in patients with ASDs and significant ma  crocephaly (HC ranging from +2.5 SD to +8 SD). Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis.

It is  associated with insufficiency and/or stenosis of the heart and results in the  pathologic changes in left ventricular structure and function as well as a  dilatation of the ascending aorta. BAV increases the risk of cardiac death. We studied a family with inherited joint dislocations and a congenital heart  disease with multiple defects (BAV with aortic root dilatation, mitral valve  prolaps, VSD, ASD). We mapped the disease to chromosome 11 and sub sequently identified hypomorphic mutations in glucuronyltransferase I (GlcAT I), the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of the last step in the linker  region tetrasaccharide formation, which connects glycosaminoglycans and  the core protein of a proteoglycan. We showed that the mutations reduce enzymatic activity and decrease the levels of all three lines of O glycanated  proteoglycans, namely dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and heparan  sulfate proteoglycans. Real time PCR showed that GlcAT I is expressed in  heart, aorta, bone, and osteoblasts   tissues affected in the patients. Further, GlcAT I protein was present in the medial tissue of the human aorta, indi   cating that altered GlcAT I function may be involved in developmental or  degenerative aortic root dilation and aortic aneurysm.

437, Array CGH detection of cryptic genomic rearrangements in children with X Linked Intellectual Disability,P02.261,,"Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, Athens, Greece, 3Research  Institute for the Study of Genetic and Malignant Disorders in Childhood, Ã¢ÂÂAghia Sophia, ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs HospitalÃ¢ÂÂ, Athens, Greece. Clinical and genetic observations have shown that X Linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) is a very heterogeneous entity, involving syndromic and non syndromic indistinguishable forms with more than 100 causative ge nes implicated and an estimated prevalence of ~10% in males. Underlying X chromosome defects are not always visible with conventional cytogenetic techniques as a first line approach, making the genetic evaluation and dia gnosis difficult. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (Array CGH) has proven a high throughput method, allowing genome wide XLID gene scree ning in the diagnostic workup. Overall 198 male patients with a large spec trum of phenotypic variability (developmental delay, seizures, dysmorphic feautures, congenital anomalies), normal previous conventional karyotype and negative genetic tests (FRAX, RETT , FISH tests or metabolic screens) were analyzed with Agilent platform 4x180K and 1x244K oligoarrays( >170.000 probes and >236.000 probes respectively with a high resolution of 8.9 Kb). 14 X chromosome cryptic rearrangements containing clinically relevant genes were detected in 21 patients, explaining partially or comple tely the pathological phenotype (Table below).The remarkable percentage of positive patients is probably due to the strict criteria of patient selection.

459, Additional evidence to support the role of the 20q13.33 region in susceptibility to autism,P03.020,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of highly heritable complex neurodevelopmental disorders and identifying its genetic bases has been challenging. The susceptibility genes so far identified seem to be involved in the proper establishment of the synaptic cleft, the secretion of surface pro teins, the excitation/inhibition balance, or the overall cellular translation processes, suggesting that impacting translation dependent processes like synaptic plasticity or cell to cell connectivity may lead to an ASD phenotype. Chromosomal imbalances identified by conventional or molecular cytoge netic techniques account for 10 15% of patients with autism. Here, we re port a third case of pure de novo 20q13.33 deletion in a boy presenting with  autism. Metabolic evaluation and standard karyotype were reported as nor   mal, as was FMR1 molecular analysis.

460, Brain specific X chromosome aneuploidy is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of autism and can explain the unsolved paradox of male susceptibility,P03.022,,"Autism is a common childhood psychiatric disorder characterized by impai red social interaction and communication, repetitive/stereotypic behavior. Numerous studies indicate that chromosomal and genomic imbalances play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism. However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain   the prime target of the disease   have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex  matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorders, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. Autistic spectrum disorders currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy. Our findings support the hypothesis that somatic genome instability could affect as homeostasis of aneuploid neurons as functioning of the neu ronal network in the whole autistic brain, playing, therefore, an important role in the pathogenesis.

470,Chromosome kissing in association with the ATR X syndrome,P03.036,,"ATR X (X linked ÃÂ± thalassemia / mental retardation) syndrome is one of the syndromes associated with abnormal epigenetic gene regulation, which  appears males with X linked mental retardation, HbH disease, skeletal ab   normalities, and autistic behavior. ATR X syndrome is caused by a mutation  in the ATRX gene localized on the X chromosome (Xq21.1), which encodes  ATRX protein, one of the chromatin remodeling proteins. However, the  details of molecular mechanism with symptoms of this syndrome are still unknown. Here to learn more about the relationships between nuclear ar chitecture and failure of epigenetic regulation in the ATR X syndrome, we ex   amined characteristics of spatial positioning of following three chromosome arm specific regions by 3D FISH technique; 1) Xq (ATRX gene has mapped on), 2) 16p (HBA has mapped on), and 3) 11p (HBB has mapped on). After  image acquisition by confocal laser scaning microscope, analysis of relative  spatial positioning of three painted regions was performed.

Background: Copy number variants (CNV) are associated with a significance increased risk of diseases for the individual and/or their family members.  They are contributing to the development of congenital anomalies, intellec  tual disabilities, spectrum autism disorder and other psychiatric disorders. It is known that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among adults with  intellectual disability is higher than in control population. Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 100 adult patients affected by mild/mode rate intellectual disability associated with psychiatric disorders and minor dysmorphic features. Genetic analysis included array comparative genomic  hybridization (aCGH) (Agilent 400K), performed in 45 cases at present. Results: We detected 89 rare and potentially pathogenic CNVs in 37 cases, with an average of 2,4 CNV/case (1 8). These CNVs include 184 genes (2,07  genes/CNV). At present, we can correlate known CNVs with intellectual  disability and/or psychiatric disorders in 13 patients (31,1%). Deletions and duplications found in these cases are: del2p12, del2p16.3, dup3q29,  del12p12.1, dup15q11q13, del15q13.1q13.3, dup15q25.2, del15q26.2,  dup15qter, dup17q24.1q24.2, del22qter, and dupXq22.1. Genes responsible of psychiatric disorders and some of them also with intellectual disability are: CTNNA2, NRXN1, PAK2, SOX5, GABRB3, CHRNA7, ADAMTSL3, MCTP2,  APOH and SHANK3. Del2p16.3 is present in three patients and is the only  recurrent CNV associated with psychiatric disorders. NRXN1 gene is related  with susceptibility to autism, schizophrenia and mental retardation. Conclusion: We most emphasise the high frequency of rare CNVs associated  specially with psychiatric disorder in patients with mild/moderate intellec tual disability.This work was supported by a grant of FIS (PI080778).",2012.0,,"M.

This ap proach led us to discover further cryptic chromosomal rearrangements, pre viously undetected by conventional cytogenetic procedures. We identified two genes: SLC8A3 (human gene for member 3 of solute carrier family 8), a  sodium calcium exchanger electively expressed in the brain, and a possible candidate gene for Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2010) and the CSMD1 gene (Cub  and sushi multiple domains 1) a candidate gene for Autism associated with Mental Retardation (MR) and Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2011). This approach allows us to better delineate the genotype/phenotype correlation in our pa tients.

530, Clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with de novo 0.45 Mb deletion of 2p16.1,P03.102,,"The widespread use of microarray methods has contributed to the identi fication of several new rare microdeletion syndromes including that asso   ciated with deletions of 2p15 p16.1. The 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndro me is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, microcephaly, growth retardation, facial abnormalities, disturbed vision and other symptoms. We report here an 11 year old autistic girl showing clinical features consistent with the syndrome. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of the patient showed a normal female karyotype. Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 BeadChip analysis revealed a 0.45 Mb long deletion of the paternal allele of  2p16.1. FISH analysis confirmed the deletion in the patient but not in any of  her parents. The deleted region contains only 3 protein coding RefSeq ge  nes, BCLA11, PAPOLG and REL, and 1 long non coding RNA gene FLJ16341. Based on high phenotype similarity of our patient with 6 reported patients  showing the typical phenotype of the 2p15 p16.1 microdeletion syndrome  we propose that the critical region of the syndrome can be narrowed down and that these brain expressed genes can be considered candidates for the clinical symptoms. However, multiple deletions of variable length within  the interval between 2p14 and 2p16.1 have been described in patients with  intellectual disability but not necessarily the other typical symptoms of the syndrome and some of these deletions do not overlap. This observati  on indicates that also other genes located in this broader unstable region  are associated with cognitive functioning.

This  finding leads to the suggestion that all cases of undiagnosed MR should be  screened for subtelomeric aberration. Nevertheless, resolution of standard karyotyping using G banding is limited and cannot detect this anomaly.  Therefore, in this study, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification  (MLPA) technique, was used to screen 129 patients with idiopathic MR.  Twelve of them were also diagnosed with autistic disorder. We identified 5 patients (3.87%) with subtelomeric aberration. All have MR with normal ka ryotypes. One patient has a submicroscopic deletion at 1p36.33 which was  confirmed by real time PCR. There are two patients with subtelomeric du  plication at 15q11.2 and 11p15.5 subsequently. Two patients have the same  duplication at Xp22.33. Results were confirmed by using additional MLPA probes. Parental samples were also examined when available. Interestingly the deletion at 1p36.33 and duplication at Xp22.33 fall into the regions whe  re copy number variation (CNV) have been reported. However the patholo   gic effect of these aberrations is still inconclusive. Further characterization  of these aberration boundaries and screening in normal population should be performed. Nonetheless this study shows that MLPA technique is able to detect subtelomeric aberration in patients with idiopathic MR and may  increase diagnostic yield especially where array facility is unavailable.",2012.0,,"S.

Hence chromosome analysis may not be thought of. Cases are most easily ascertained through chromosome and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies.Method: A three year old girl from a bilingual family was investigated. She  had hypotonia, a modest speech delay and unsteady gait due to a foot defor   mity. Different genetic methods such as chromosomal analysis, FISH, Mul   tiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), array comparative genomic hybridization (ACGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP array) were used to elucidate her phenotype.Results: The results will be presented at the meeting.

Introduction: Chromosome euchromatic variants most commonly result from copy number variation (CNV) of gene and pseudogene containing poly   morphic genomic segments that became visible at the cytogenetic level. In trachromosomal rearrangements of the proximal short arm of chromosome 16, leading to 16p+ morphology can raise interpretation problems because both euchromatic variants (16p11.2v) and unbalanced duplications have been described in this region.Case report: An amniocentesis performed at 16  weeks gestation, due to maternal age, revealed a de novo 16p+ chromo   some by GTL banding. C banding and N/DAPI staining were negative. WCP labeled all 16p+ chromosome. MLPA analysis with eleven probes for 16p11  (kit P343) was normal, while, array CGH pointed to a 1.9 MB duplication in  16p11.2. Fetal ultrasound did not show any morphological defects. Postnatal  FISH study with a panel of RP11 BACs confirmed the presence of a duplica   tion involving the CNVs regions of proximal 16p11.2 (euchromatic variant) and no evidence of a duplication in the autism or development delay regi on 16p11.2. Discussion: The occurrence of de novo structural euchromatic  chromosome abnormalities presents a genetic counseling dilemma, parti cularly when ascertained in the prenatal setting, as the prognosis can be more reliably discussed when the chromosome abnormality is transmitted by a phenotypically unaffected parent. Fetal ultrasound, postnatal clinical reports, molecular cytogenetic analyses may all contribute with critical data to the genetic counseling. Professionals involved in prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling should be aware of the euchromatic variant 16p11.2v in order to establish the differential diagnosis and provide parents with proper information.",2012.0,,"V.

Sonographic examina   tion in the 22nd week of gestation showed bilateral cystic kidney disease  and oligohydramnios. Amniotic fluid sampling was performed for molecular genetic testing and karyotyping. The cytogenetic karyotype was normal (46, XY). HNF1B analysis by sequencing showed no mutation but MLPA revealed a heterozygous deletion of the complete gene.

This is im portant for setting up a good pre test counseling.Methods: We performed HumanCytoSNP 12 array (Illumina) analysis of un cultured amniotic fluid cells and LTC villi in 344 cases of fetal anomalies after exclusion of the common aneuploidies and triploidy. For correct in terpretation, simultaneous analysis of both parents was performed in most cases. According to our policy, only clinically relevant copy number variants (CNVs) were reported to the clinical geneticist who counselled the parents.Results: On a total of 344 arrays, 36 (10,5 %) CNVs were found that were interpreted as clinically relevant based on current knowledge. 24 (7 %) were most probably causative explaining the ultrasound abnormalities and 12 (3,5 %) were so called Ã¢ÂÂunexpected findingsÃ¢ÂÂ that are most likely not di rectly associated with the fetal anomalies. In the latter cases the involved CNVs were risk factors for mental disability, autism spectrum disorder, schi   zophrenia etc. CNVs involving genes like DMD or BRCA2 were not found so far.Conclusions: These findings stress the importance of a pre test counseling with special attention for this type of risk factors, taking into account that risk figures are based upon postnatal studies and that the prenatal manife station of such factors is not yet studied. In our opinion, the pregnant wo man should get the opportunity to decide whether she wants to be informed about these CNVs, which may potentially complicate decision making on continuation or termination of the pregnancy.",2012.0,,"J.

896, Analysis of polymorphisms in GABRA2 and AUTS2 genes in patients with alcoholism from Russia,P08.02,,"Family, twin and adoption studies have provided evidence of a genetic component (40 60%) in the origins of addictive disorders. One of very few confirmed genetic association findings differentiating alcoholics from non alcoholics is with variants in the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid a2 receptor subunit (GABRA2 ) gene. Also according to the recent genome  wide association study variation in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2 ) was strongly associated with alcohol consumption. Population  stratification and ancestry differences within populations may compromise the success of association studies. Therefore analysis of genes variants in homogeneous ethnic groups is of great importance.We designed a classical case control association study for two polymorphis   ms: rs279858 in GABRA2  and rs6943555 in AUTS2  that were tested for asso   ciation with alcoholism. 307 men with ICD 10 diagnosis of alcoholism (112 Russians, 91 Tatars, 100 Bashkirs), and matched control groups were typed for the above mentioned gene variants using PCR RFLP technique.In Russian population the frequency of individuals carrying the *G allele of  rs279858 polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with early onset alcoholism as compared with the healthy controls (p,0.03;OR,1.40). The carriers of GABRA2*A/*A  genotype were found to be at low risk of al   coholism development (p,0.04;OR,0,57).

904, Identifying genetic determinants of congenital heart defect in Down syndrome,P08.11,,"Congenital heart defect (CHD) is a common developmental defect of Down syndrome (DS) occurring in 40% of cases. While carrying three copies of ge nes or other functional genomic elements on chromosome 21 increases the risk for CHD, trisomy 21 itself is not sufficient to cause CHD. Thus additio   nal genetic variation and/or environmental factors could contribute to CHD risk. Here we use association studies to identify genomic variations that in concert with trisomy 21, determine the risk for CHD in DS. This case control GWAS includes 187 DS with CHD (AVSD,69, ASD,53, VSD,65) as cases, and 151 DS without CHD as controls. Chromosome 21 specific association study revealed rs2832616 and rs1943950 (both cis eQTLs for KRTAP7 1 gene) as CHD risk alleles (adjusted p values < 0.05). Furthermore rs2183593 and rs7282991 (both cis eQTLs for ADARB1 gene) were identified as risk fac tors for ASD. Since DS is likely to be a disorder of gene expression, 2 locus interaction was applied for whole genome eQTLs. A pair of interacting eQTL on chr2 and chr11 was identified. Furthermore, a search for chr21 risk CNVs for CHD was performed using a customized chr21 array of 135K probes across 55 DS CHD and 53 DS controls. It revealed two CNV regions (FDR,0.04) located in the region previously associated with CHD risk in DS and another CNV region (FDR,0.03) upstream of POFUT2 gene.

The formation of the atrial septum during cardiac development is a com plex process being vulnerable to a wide range of dysmorphogenesis. A ge netic link and anatomical continuum between secundum atrial septal defect (ASDII) and patent forame ovale (PFO) have been suggested by murine and human studies. While ASDII and PFO occur commonly and represent a signi ficant burden to health resources, the genetic complexity of such conditions is not fully known. PFO incidence in inbred mice, as we reported earlier, is strongly correlated with quantitative parameters of atrial septum. We pre viously mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying such parameters using F2 intercross between QSi5 and 129T2/SvEms, parental strains with extremes of septal dysmorphogenesis. Subsequently, breeding of parental strains continued for 12 further generations to establish an advanced inter   cross line (AIL). We genotyped 150 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers at an average interval of 2cM in 400 F14 mice. AIL confirmed the F2 QTL and significantly improved confidence intervals of the QTL. After   ward, we performed whole genome sequencing of the parental strains and identified variations between the sequences. The genome was partitioned into high and low SNP rate intervals and the genes within high SNP rate regions of the QTL confidence intervals were identified. As a confirmatory method, we used mouse HapMap imputation genotype resource. The list of candidate genes was prioritized according to sequence and expression profiles.

959, Contribution of rare and common variants of the PTCHD1 gene to Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability,P09.028,,"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by impaired verbal communication, limited reciprocal social interaction, restricted inte rests and repetitive behavior, often accompanied by intellectual disability (ID). Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain.

960," Mirror effects for Autism Spectrum Disorder due to gene dosage at 10q11.22 affecting GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth and PPYR1 gene involved in energy homeostasis.",P09.030,,", Madrid, Spain. We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including  GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome. Specifi   cally, duplications were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of speech, and lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features. Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant. We concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients. We now report more convincing evidences that dosage balance at GPRIN2 locus plays a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We observed 6 pati   ents affected by ASD with an overlapping small deletion including the two genes (and extending to MAPK8 in one patient). We then compared a group of 164 ASD patients with a group of 180 syndromic and non syndromic intel lectual deficit (SID/NSID) patients and 160 controls. Seven deletions were identified in the ASD group. On the contrary, no deletion has were found in SID/NSID nor in control group (p,0,005 and p,0,008). We are currently extending this study to a second cohort including about 100 ASD patients and 135 SID/NSID.

1124,Comparison of different reference genes used for qPCR based CNV quantification,P11.013,,"Copy Number Variant (CNVs), the change of the DNA copy number in the genome, has been recently shown to be a widely spread phenomenon that  affects about 10 20% of the human genome. The occurrence of the CNVs has  been associated with various diseases such as autism, autoimmune disor   ders, and cancer. The most commonly used molecular biology tools for discovery of CNVs are  array and next generation sequencing (NGS). These two high throughput methods can discover multiple potential CNVs, which normally need to be validated with an independent method. Once validated, the confirmed CNVs  can also be examined in a large number of samples to identify the statisti  cally significant association of the CNV and phenotype. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), with its ease of use, sensitivity, and scalability, is often the method  of choice for CNV validation and association studies.

1145, Accurate detection of de novo mutations in rare and common neurodevelopmental disorders,P11.035,,"Many dominant Mendelian disorders occur sporadically because the seve rity and early onset of the disorder preclude transmission to subsequent generations. Exome sequencing represents the first systematic approach to identify many genes that cause sporadic diseases. De novo mutations cau  sing rare syndromic forms of dominant Mendelian disease, such as Schinzel Giedion syndrome and Kabuki syndrome were first identified by applying overlap strategies, i.e. identifying mutations in the same gene in multiple  independent affected individuals. Subsequent studies focused on the role of de novo mutations in common neurodevelopmental disorders, such as in  tellectual disability, autism and schizophrenia by applying a trio design, i.e. exome sequencing of patient parent trios.In order to establish a robust approach optimized for de novo analysis, we  used latest SOLiD 5500XL sequencing technologies in combination with the recently announced wildfire product (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA).

1274, The atypical Rett syndrome protein CDKL5 promotes excitatory synapse formation by strengthening the interaction between NGL 1 and the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD95,P12.042,,"Mutations in the X linked gene cyclin dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical features that are closely  related to Rett syndrome (RTT), including intellectual disability, early on  set intractable epilepsy and autism. However, very little is currently known  about the biological role of CDKL5. We here show that Cdkl5 localizes at  excitatory synapses and contributes to correct spine morphology and syn aptic activity. Since we previously found that a balanced chromosome trans  location in the Netrin G1 gene (NTNG1) also caused atypical RTT with early  onset seizures, we hypothesized that the two genes play a role in common  pathogenetic processes. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation ex   periments revealed that Cdkl5 interacts with the Netrin G1 ligand NGL 1,  a postsynaptic neuronal adhesion protein. In addition, we could show that  NGL 1 is phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is mediated by CD   KL5, in vitro. Using fibroblasts from a patient who carried a truncation of  the CDKL5 gene, we obtained further evidence that CDKL5 phosphorylates  NGL 1. Moreover, we have found that this phosphorylation is necessary for promoting a stable association between NGL 1 and PSD95, a scaffold protein  of the post synaptic density. Accordingly, phospho mutant NGL 1 lacked the  ability to induce synaptic contacts, while its phospho mimetic form bound  PSD95 more efficiently and partially rescued the CDKL5 specific spine de   fects.

As a  consequence, the identification of the genes responsible for these pheno  types remained limited. Using high resolution microarrays, we identified intragenic copy number variations in the CG 1 domain of the Calmodulin  binding Transcription Activator 1 (CAMTA1) gene, segregating with au   tosomal dominant ID with NPCA in two unrelated families, and a de novo  deletion located in the same domain in a child presenting with NPCA. In the ID patients, the deletion led to a frameshift, producing a truncated protein,  while this was not the case for the patient with isolated childhood ataxia.  Brain MRI of the patients revealed a pattern of progressive atrophy of cere bellum medium lobes and superior vermis, parietal lobes and hippocampi.  Although DNA sequencing of the CG 1 domain in 197 patients with sporadic  or familial non syndromic intellectual deficiency, extended to full DNA se   quencing in 50 patients with ID and 47 additional patients with childhood  ataxia, identified no pathogenic mutation, there is considerable evidence  that CAMTA1 rearrangements are being disease causing. Indeed, CAMTA1 is a brain specific calcium responsive transcription factor expressed in the brain and cerebellum during development and later implicated in memory processes; intragenic rearrangements are concentrated in a highly conser   ved functional domain with transcription regulation ability and nuclear traf ficking functions; CAMTA1 transcriptional studies have shown upregulation of genes already implicated in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.

1483, Is histidinemia always a Ã¢ÂÂnon diseaseÃ¢ÂÂ? and why truncating mutations in the HAL gene appear so rare?,P13.25,,"Histidinemia is an autosomal recessive defect with an incidence of 1/12000 20000, due to a deficient activity of histidine ammonia lyase (HAL gene). In itial studies in the 1970s suggested that it might be associated to intellectual deficiency, epilepsy, autism or ataxia. Later assessment of cases identified through neonatal screening, who did not suffer from developmental delay or ID, led to consider histidinemia as a non disease. A recent study has sug gested however that it may be a risk factor for autism (Miyachi et al. 2009). Because of this lack of established clinical impact, interest in this trait has subsided and a single mutation study in the HAL gene revealed only 4 diffe rent missense mutations in a minority of tested cases ascertained through neonatal screening. Following the identification of histidinemia in a girl with developmental delay and ataxia, we initiated a mutation study. Prelimina ry results on 3 patients with ID revealed 5 different missense mutations, and one splice site mutation. In another case with no reported neurological phenotype, another homozygous missense variant was found, not predicted pathogenic by SIFT or Polyphen2. Up to now, truncating mutations appear underrepresented (one detected compared to 10 different missenses). The spontaneous histidinemic mouse mutant (with no obvious neurologic phe notype) is also due to a missense mutation.

1546, Deletion of SHANK3 gene detected by MLPA in a patient with autistic features and hyperactivity,J02.03,,"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder and one of the most heri   table neuropsychiatric syndromes, with a male to female ratio of 4:1. The diagnosis of autism is based on impairments in reciprocal social interaction  and communication, and restricted and stereotyped patterns of interests  and activities, with abnormal development apparent within the first 3 years of life. Autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) include: autistic disorder, child  hood disintegrative disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not other   wise specified, Asperger syndrome and Rett syndrome. There is substantial  evidence from twin and family studies to support the involvement of genetic factors in ASDs. We report a case of 3 years old boy with echolalia, irrelevant talk, not com  prehensible. Muttered to himself occasionally, poor social interaction and avoided eye contact. He was unable to follow commands and responded to  his name very rarely. The child was born after 8 yrs of a non consanguineous  marriage, gestation was controlled and it was a full term caesarean delivery. The provisional clinical diagnosis was autistic features with hyperactivity.  Karyotype was normal, X fragile syndrome analysis was normal too and  was performed a genetic analysis using MLPA (SALSA ÃÂ®MLPAÃÂ® Subtelome  ric Screening P070, X linked mental retardation P106 and Microdeletion  Syndromes P245). Analysis results showed a deletion in SHANK3 gene in  22q13.3.

Individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion may have wide range of clinical  manifestations including intellectual disability (ID), cardiac malformati  ons, seizures, autism and schizophrenia. Deletion of CHRNA7  gene in this  region is causative for the majority of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in  the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. Subsets of persons with the deleti  on have no obvious clinical findings. During 2009 2011 the chromosomal  microarray analysis (CMA) was performed in 596 individuals due to their clinical indications. In four individuals 15q13.3 microdeletion was found. In one patient 15q13.2 q13.3 microdeletion was diagnosed previously during  research study of the children with ID. Here we present the clinical features  of five patients with 15q13.2 q13.3 microdeletion.All our patients (aged 6 17 years, among them two sibs) had normal grow   th parameters, except one boy with larger deletion 15q13.2 q13.3 who had short stature and microcephaly. Mild or unspecified ID, speech delay and mild facial dysmorphism was noticed in all patients. Abnormal EEG was  found in three of them (60%) and one boy has severe treatment resistant  generalized epilepsy (20%). Positive family history for epilepsy was docu mented in two families. Therefore, it is highly possible that their epilepsy may be also caused by 15q13.3 microdeletion (not investigated yet) as in 1 2% of individuals with generalized epilepsy 15q13.3 microdeletion is found. Cardiac anomaly was occurred in three children (60%).Microdeletion 15q13.3 is one of the most common microdeletions found by CMA in individuals with ID.

1633, Detection of Fragile x chromosome mutation in males with developmental delay / mental retardation,J05.03,,"The fragile X syndrome gene (FMR1) contains a highly variable repeat of the nucleotide triplet (CGG). A variety of clinical conditions is associated with the expanded allele sizes that predominantly affect males. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a large expansion of CGG repeat (full mutation) which silences the FMR1 gene and stops the protein (FMRP) production. An important feature of the syndrome is mental impairment which may in clude mental retardation, autism, etc. It is therefore important to exclude FXS whenever patients are in diagnostic procedure for developmental delay affecting mental capabilities.For the detection of the FXS patients, a PCR based technique, designed as an exclusion test, was used. This technique is useful for the detection of normal variants of the CGG repeat number in males and heterozygous females. The definitive diagnosis of FXS based on molecular genetic analysis, Southern blot technique, which is labour intensive and time consuming.We analyzed DNA samples from 97 male subjects from North Eastern Slove nia referred for genetic testing because of developmental delay / mental re tardation. The PCR amplification for FXS was successful in 92 patients out of 97 (94.8%).

Autism is noticeably reported to be affected by mitochondrial dysfunction which impairs energy metabolism. mtDNA encodes 22 tRNAs working as amino acid transporters for synthesis of the respiratory chain enzymes. In volvement of mutations within tRNA genes have been well documented in mitochondrial disorders. In this study, tRNA Pro and tRNAThr were investigated  to find mutations which are related to autism pathogenesis, as these two genes mutations have been reported to be involved in some neurological disorders.Methods: In this study, a cohort of 24 unrelated idiopathic patients and 100 ethnically matched Persian control individuals were obtained. PCR sequen   cing of mtDNA fragments was employed to investigate the involvement of mitochondrial variations in autism.Results: A substitution , G15928A, was identified in two groups without a significant difference (P , 0.179, P> 0.05). A new homoplasmic substitusion, A15973G, was identified within the T loop of tRNA Pro gene in 1 patient as  it had not been reported before. This variation is moderatelyly conserved (75 %) among species and also, was not detected in blood sample from the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother.Conclusion: Investigation on mitochondrial varations may strengthen the role of genetics in association with autism.

SNP microarrays extend diagnostic scope beyond detection of submicroscopic pathogenic copy number changes by also revealing uniparental disomy, chi merism, chromosomal mosaicism and long continuous stretches of homo   zygosity (LCSH) creating the potential to determine previously undisclosed incestuous relationships, posing legal and ethical challenges for genetic ser   vices.Methods & ResultsSNP microarray was performed on 11000 consecutive samples. LCSH was detected in 1156 samples (10.5%). Close parental relatedness (greater than 6.25% LCSH) was detected in 322 samples (3%), with 4 samples showing homozygosity levels >20%, consistent with a first degree relationship bet   ween parents. Two known cases of first degree unions were detected with homozygosity levels of 17.3% and 19%.DiscussionIdentification of close parental relatedness poses unique ethical and legal challenges for genetic services. Can we reliably differentiate between exten sive LCSH arising from incestuous relationships and consanguineous unions over several generations? How these findings should be reported to avoid inappropriate or insensitive disclosure whilst fulfilling legal and ethical ob ligations, protect the childÃ¢ÂÂs right to privacy, whilst ensuring medically rele vant information is available is complex. We will present the approach our service has developed to deal with results indicating close parental related   ness. Next generation microarrays are likely to combine both the CGH and SNP platforms.

4, C terminal deletions of the AUTS2 locus cause distinct syndromic features and cognitive impairment,PL2.2,,"Translocations involving 7q21.22 have been associated with autism and in tellectual disability (ID). Discordant evidence has suggested that these cli nical phenotypes might be driven by a number of genes (AUTS2, WBSCR17, CALN1). Here, we examined whether AUTS2 disruptions are causal for neu  rocognitive defects.An international cohort of ~50,000 patients and 16,000 controls was ex   amined for CNVs in AUTS2 by array CGH and we performed detailed pheno  typic analyses. 5âRACE experiments were performed to test for alternative transcripts in human brain. A zebrafish knock down model was generated to test the potential of different AUTS2  splice isoforms to induce some of the  anatomical phenotypes seen in patients.We found 44 AUTS2 deletions. Microdeletions disrupting the coding se   quence were causal to a complex syndromic ID/autism phenotype including short stature, microcephaly, cerebral palsy and distinct facial dysmorphis   ms. The exonic AUTS2 deletions occur with a frequency comparable to NSD1  deletions causing Sotos syndrome. We also discovered a novel, highly con served, C terminal AUTS2 isoform in human brain. Clinical and functional  studies showed this isoform to be a key contributor to the human phenotype because (a) patients with C terminal deletions exhibited significantly more severe and pleiotropic aspects of AUTS2  syndrome, and (b) the significant  microcephaly and craniofacial defects seen in auts2 knockdown zebrafish  embryos were rescued by this C terminal isoform.We identified a hitherto unappreciated syndromic phenotype caused by deletions in AUTS2,  required for both brain and craniofacial development.  The C terminal portion of the gene contributes significantly to the pheno type, demonstrating how transcriptional complexity can underpin human pathology.  E. Voorhoeve: None. G. Beunders: None. C.

22,The role of microglia in synaptogenesis,S04.1,,"Microglia are phagocytic cells that infiltrate the brain during development and play a role in the elimination of synapses during brain maturation.  Changes in microglia morphology and gene expression have been associated  with autism. However, it remains unknown whether these changes are a primary cause or a secondary consequence of neuronal deficits associated  with the disorder. Here we tested whether a primary deficit in microglia was  sufficient to induce autism related behavioral and functional connectivity deficits. Mice lacking the microglia chemokine receptor Cx3cr1 showed a transient reduction of microglia in the brain during the early postnatal peri   od and a consequent deficit in synaptic pruning. Deficient synaptic pruning was associated with a failure to strengthen excitatory synaptic transmission, decreased functional connectivity across brain regions, deficits in social in teraction, and increased repetitive behavior, all hallmarks of autism. These  findings open the possibility that deficits in microglia function could contri  bute to key features of autism.",2013.0,,C. Gross,"Monterotondo, Italy"
52, Apparently balanced chromosome rearrangements in human development,S14.2,,"Apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements are an invaluable bio  logical resource for annotation of the human genome and the foundation of the Developmental Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP , dgap.harvard.edu). Implementation of next generation sequencing of rearrangements has faci litated rapid gene discovery for structural and neurodevelopmental (NDD) disorders. Structural disorders elucidated include those from subjects with various craniofacial abnormalities and brain, ocular, auditory, kidney, and bone aberrations, with validation in subjects with overlapping phenotypes or in animal models. Validation of genes in subjects with NDD has been dif   ficult historically but is now feasible taking advantage of convergent geno mic evidence. Rearrangement breakpoints were sequenced in 38 subjects with NDD and validation performed using copy number variants (CNVs) in 19,556 cases and 13,991 controls. Genes disrupted within microdeletion syndromes included SATB2 (2q33.1), MBD5  (2q23.1) and EHMT1 (9q34.3),  all of which are transcription and epigenetic regulators. In a follow up study among an international network of investigators, 65 independent 2q23.1 microdeletions were ascertained, defining the role of MBD5  as necessary  and sufficient in the 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome. Disrupted loci in some subjects associate with a spectrum of developmental and psychiatric disor   ders, including mental retardation, autism, language delay, schizophrenia, psychosis, cognitive impairment, and bipolar disorder, bridging phenotypes with genetic etiologies. Genes at breakpoints novel for correlation with NDD have diverse functions from methylation and transcriptional regulation to cell signaling, cell adhesion, and nonsense mediated decay. In addition, a  number of observations were made from the sequence analysis concerning genomic architecture of constitutional rearrangements including complex events akin to chromothripsis in neoplasms, nonhomologous end joining as a predominant mechanism and the presence of inversions in derivative chromosomes at sites of rearrangement. Nucleotide level resolution of ap parently balanced rearrangements through next generation sequencing can contribute to diagnostic precision in abnormal human phenotypes leading to improved genetic counseling, and can illuminate underlying genomic molecular mechanisms.

121,Abnormal expression of sex biased genes in PCDH19 female limited epilepsy and intellectual disability (PCDH19 FLE) suggests a role for neurosteroid hormones.,C08.5,,"PCDH19 Female Limited Epilepsy (PCDH19 FLE) is an unusual X linked disorder that primarily affects females. PCDH19 FLE encompasses a broad  clinical spectrum from early infantile epileptic encephalopathy resembling  Dravet syndrome to epilepsy with or without intellectual disability and be  havioural problems, including autism. PCDH19 FLE is highly but not fully penetrant. We have tackled the questions of molecular pathogenesis of PCDH19 FLE by examining the transcriptomes of primary skin fibroblasts  of PCDH19 FLE females (n,12 and n,3 age and passage matched normal  controls) and unaffected transmitting males (n,3 and n,3 age and passa  ge matched control males). We found that the expression of genes, which  normally show sex (male/female) biased expression in this cell type, was significantly altered (observed , 43/94 vs expected , 223/19223, p,1.09 x  10 55, two tail Fisherâs exact test). Followup studies (including additional  skin fibroblast cell lines) validated at least ~60% of selected genes. From  among several plausible biological candidates we focused our attention on  the aldo keto reductase family 1, member C1 3 (AKR1C1 3) genes, which play crucial role in neurosteroid hormone metabolism (which skin is endo   wed with). Additional support for steroid and neurosteroid hormone role in the pathology of PCDH19 FLE came from the age of onset (mean ~10  months) and offset (mean ~12.5 years) of epilepsy (n,100 patients), both of  which coincide with dramatically varying sex hormone levels (onset   after âminipubertyâ and offset   with the advent of puberty). This led us to postula   te the neurosteroid hypothesis, which may explain PCDH19 FLE and opens realistic opportunities for targeted therapeutic interventions.  C. Tan: None. C. Shard: None. K.

158,New genes in epilepsy and its co morbidities: a linkage and whole exome sequencing approach.,C15.2,,"Purpose: The majority of epilepsies are focal in origin, with seizures arising in one region of the brain. The aetiology of most cases of focal epilepsy re mains unknown and has not generally been thought to be genetic. We stu died large pedigrees with forms of focal epilepsy (NFLE and FFEVF) which showed autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance to identify the genes respon   sible and then studied their broader contribution to the focal epilepsies.Method: We used a strategy of whole genome linkage analysis followed by whole exome sequencing in two families with FFEVF mapping to Chromoso   me 22q12 and one large family with ADNFLE mapping to 9q34.3.Results: We detected mutations in DEPDC5 in the two families and sub sequently in 5/6 additional families with FFEVF. Furthermore, we found DEPDC5 mutations in approximately 12% (10/82) of families with non lesional focal epilepsy. A mutation in the potassium channel gene KCNT1 was identified in the family with NFLE and subsequently in three other fami lies with NFLE. Mutation positive family members were also affected with psychiatric features, intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorders.Conclusions: Mutations in DEPDC5 account for approximately 12% of cases of non lesional familial focal epilepsy, becoming the most common known cause of familial focal epilepsy. KCNT1 mutations contribute to nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) as well as to psychiatric features. Genetic fac tors therefore play an increasing role in the focal epilepsies.

188,Associations between gene expression and phenotypes in 16p11.2 rearrangements,C20.3,,"The recurrent 600kb long 16p11.2 deletion and its reciprocal duplication impact carriersâ cognition and behavior.

Although these imbalances are among the most frequent causes of neuro developmental disorders, the triggered transcriptome alterations and their associations with the aforementioned phenotypes remained unexplored.We generated transcriptome profiles of lymphoblastoid cell lines from 16p11.2 deletion and duplication carriers, as well as controls. The expres   sion levels of the 29 genes mapping to the imbalanced interval correlate to their gene dosage. We observed a greater correlation of the expression levels of KCTD13, MVP and MAPK3, three genes shown to have an epista tic effect on zebrafish head size. To investigate the functional relationship between gene expression levels and phenotypes, we transformed anthro pometric measurements into Z scores. We found that Z scores computed for weight and BMI were significantly associated with MAPK3 and MVP ex   pression after adjustment for copy number status in a multivariate normal linear model for adults. We also show that transcription modules (subsets of genes that exhibit a coherent expression profile) involved in the regula   tion of gene expression, chromatin modification, control of apoptosis and cell division are perturbed in cells of 16p11.2 patients, further confirming the emerging association between âcancer associatedâ genes/pathways and neurodevelopmental disorders.

The patients exhibit predominant different neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, seizures, developmental delay, clumsiness, schi zophrenia or schizoaffective patterns. Minor dysmorphic features such as macrocephaly, down slanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal bridge, pouting lips, expressionless face, frontal tuft of hair were presented in many cases in various combinations.We report the 9 years old boy for developmental delay, only slight dysmor phic facial features and obesity with a PWS like phenotype. His height is 140 cm, weight 51 kg (>75thcentile) and OFC 54 cm (>90thcentile). He had facial dysmorphisms reminiscent of PWS with small almond shaped eyes, small down turned mouth, small hands and feet, generalized obesity (BMI,26, >97thcentile). He also presented developmental delay (QIP,96, QIG,87), especially of speech (QIV,85) and he followed speech therapies. His mother has similar dysmorphic phenotype: small stature (151 cm), obesity (102 kg) and learning difficulties at school. The family history was significant for obesity (maternal grandfather).Tests for Prader syndrome were FISH using Vysis Abbott Prader Willi/Angelman Region LSI SNRPN(SO)/CEP15(SG)/PML(SO), LSI D15S11(SO)/CEP15(SG) and LSI D15S11(SO)/CEP15(SG)/PML(SO).

383, Clinical and genetic study of Brazilian patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,P02.067,,"Introduction: The teratogenicity of alcohol comprises a spectrum of ano  malies known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders   FASD; the most seve  re phenotype is the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Objectives: 1) Study patients  with FASD according to the Washington Criteria Diagnosis; 2) Establish the frequency of the polymorphisms of the genes of the enzymes ADH  (ADH1B*3, ADH1B*3, ADH1C*2) and ALDH (ALDH2*2) in FASD patients;  3) Compare the FASD patients genotype to the control group. Results: 28 Brazilian patients aged 11 months to 17 years were evaluated according to the Washington Criteria protocol: 35,7% (10 patients) were classified in  the A category; 32,1% (9 patients) category C ; the remaining patients were  classified in the categories E, F, H and J. The distribution of the polymor   phisms were: ADH1B*2: genotype ADH1B*1/1 85,19% and ADH1B*1/2  14,81%. ADH1B*3: genotype ADH1B*1/1 52,17%, ADH1B*1/3 43,48% and  ADH1B*3/3 4,34%. ADH1C*2: genotype ADH1C*1/1 65,38%; ADH1C*1/2 19,24% and ADH1C*2/2 10,89%.ALDH2*2: genotype ALDH2*1/1 98,02%  and ALDH2*1/2 15,38. There were no significant differences in the distribu  tion of genotypes ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 between patients and the Brazili an population. The ADH1B * 3 allele was significantly more frequent among patients (p<0,001) and the ADH1C * 2 allele was significantly less frequent  among patients (p,0,0058) compared to the healthy Brazilian population.  Conclusion: Although it is a small sample, we may suggest that the ADH1B  * 3 allele may be a risk factor and the ADH1C * 2 allele a protective factor to the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disorders in the Brazilian population.

395, Mosaic 8p interstitial deletion with absent nails: genotype/phenotype correlation,P02.079,,"The aim  of this study was to correlate genotype/phenotype in interstiti   al deletion of chromosome 8p and to compare the sensitivity of FISH and array CGH in detection of low mosaic cell line. We reported on a male pa  tient presented at the age of 40 days with CHD and recurrent chest infec  tion. He was lethargic with infrequent myoclonic spasm. Patient had facial dysmorphism ,microcephaly.He suffered of CHD with VSD, ASD, pulmonary  stenosis and dilated right ventricle. He had intractable convulsions, hypoge nesis of corpus callosum, defects in myelination and mild reduce cerebellar size for his age. Both hands and feet showed absent nails (total anonychia)  and abnormal increasing palmar and planter creases. He had a karyotype  46,XY,del(8)(p21.2p23). Both parents had normal karyotype. FISH analysis using subtelomere 8 and locus specific identifier for LPL at 8p22 revealed  interstitial deletion involving (8)(p22) and presence of subtelomere 8p and  15% normal cell line. Nimblegen microarray analysis indicated 18.5Mb in terstitial deletion of chromosome 8p spanning cytoband (8)(p23.2 p21.3)  and involving GATA4 gene. We concluded that a post zygotic deletion occurred in this infant, FISH ana   lysis is a powerful tool in detection of low mosaic cell lines. The array CGH can identify precisely the break points and the exact deleted region. We sug  gest that the gene responsible for nail formation lies within chromosome 8p  cytoband p23.2 p21.3. DNA sequencing for the other allele is recommended to delineate the cause of absent nails whether it is due to haploinsufficiency or autosomal recessive.  A.K. Kamel: None. A.M. Mohamed: None. M.S.

420,Further expanding both the genotype and phenotype associated with germline NRAS mutation,P02.108,,"We present a case of a female infant who presented small for gestational  age with multiple abnormalities including; polyhydramnios, intracerebral  arachnoid cyst, bilateral cystic hygroma and hydronephrosis on prenatal  ultrasound. She had a normal karyotype on amniocentesis. Mother declined prenatal genetic testing for Noonan syndrome. On follow up after birth she  was notably dysmorphic with wide sutures, reddish blonde and sparse hair  which was abnormal in texture. She struggled with hypoglycemia and de   veloped apneic spells and episodes of seizure. She was hypotonic, did not feed well and required NG tube placement. Further investigations revealed  duplication of the collecting system with moderate hydronephrosis, ure  teroceles and small cortical cysts bilaterally. Brain imaging was abnormal and echocardiogram identified an ASD and bicommissural aortic valve. She  failed her newborn hearing screen and suffers from numerous urinary tract  and skin infections. Her milestones are delayed and she has ongoing GI is sues. Molecular genetic testing for Noonan syndrome identified a previously  uncharacterized germline mutation in the neuroblastoma RAS viral (v ras)  oncogene (NRAS). Previously thought to be restricted to somatic mutations, three novel germline NRAS mutations have recently been reported in nine patients presenting with features suggestive of the Noonan syndrome spec  trum. Although our patient shares many of the previously reported charac  teristic features, our patient is the tenth world wide to be reported, harbors  yet another novel de novo NRAS mutation and demonstrates a more severe phenotype which was evident prenatally.

446,"Smaller and larger deletions of the Williams Beuren syndrome region implicate genes involved in mild facial phenotype, epilepsy and autistic traits",P02.135,,"Williams Beuren syndrome is a multisystemic disorder caused by a hemizy   gous deletion of 1.5Mb on chromosome 7q11.23 spanning 28 genes. A few patients with larger and smaller WBS deletion have been reported. They  show clinical features that vary between isolated SVAS to the full spectrum  of WBS phenotype, associated with epilepsy or autism spectrum behavior.We describe four patients with atypical 7q11.23 deletions identified by mul   tiple ligation probe amplification analysis and fine mapping by quantitative real time PCR. Two carry an approximately 3.5 Mb larger deletion towards the telomere that includes HIP1  and YWHAG genes. Other two carry a shor   ter deletion of approximately 1.2 Mb at centromeric side that excludes the  distal WBS genes BAZ1B  and FZD9 , respectively. Along with previously reported cases, genotype phenotype correlation in  the patients described here further suggests that haploinsufficiency of HIP1   and YWHAG might cause the severe neurological and neuropsychological  deficits including epilepsy and autistic traits and that the preservation of BAZ1B  and FZD9  genes may be related to mild facial features and moderate  neuropsychological deficits. This report highlights the importance to cha racterize additional patients with 7q11.23 atypical deletions and to com pare neuropsychological and clinical features between individuals with lar  ger and smaller WBS deletion to shed light on the pathogenic role of genes  within and flanking the Williams Beuren syndrome region.

Her Brain CT showed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum and EEG records showed bilateral epileptogenic focus. She has a karyotype of 45,X,t(X;14)(p22;p11), both parents had normal karyo type. FISH analysis using Xp subtelomere, Shox, XIST gene, and subtelomere 14 revealed Ish t(X;14)(Xpter ,Xp22 ). The active centromere belongs to the chromosome 14. Array CGH using Agilent detected a 2Mb loss in Xp22.33 and 4,5Mb gain in Xp22.2p22.12. The deleted region contains 12 genes of which CSFRA and Shox are known as OMIM Morbid Genes. The duplicated region contains 7 OMIM morbid Genes. We used late replicating chromatin technique to detect the pattern of X inactivation. we found that 70% of the translocated X is the inactive one, in the same time the translocated chro mosome 14 escape inactivation, while in 30% the normal X is the inactivate one leaving the abnormal X as the active one. The clinical picture may be affected by the haploinsufficiency of the genes that are known to escape X inactivation and lie within the deleted region (Xp22.33), or it is affected by duplicated genes (Xp22.2p22.12) on the abnormal X when it was the active one.

510,Identifying genetic determinants of congenital heart defect in Down syndrome,P04.16,,"Congenital heart defect (CHD) occurs in 40% of Down syndrome cases. While carrying three copies of genes or other functional elements on chr21 ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 135Back to index increases the risk for CHD, trisomy 21 is not sufficient to cause CHD. Thus  additional genetic variation and/or environmental factors could contribute  to CHD risk. Here we use association studies to identify genomic variations  that with trisomy 21, determine the risk for CHD in DS. This GWAS includes 187 DS with CHD (AVSD,69, ASD,53, VSD,65) as cases, and 151 DS without  CHD as controls. Chr21 specific association study revealed rs2832616 and  rs1943950 (both cis eQTLs for KRTAP7 1) as CHD risk alleles (adjusted p values < 0.05). These signals were confirmed in a replication cohort of 92 DS CHD cases and 75 DS controls (nominal p value , 0.0005). Furthermore  rs2183593 and rs7282991 were identified as risk factors for ASD. Since DS  is likely to be a disorder of gene expression, 2 locus interaction was applied for whole genome eQTLs. A pair of interacting eQTL on chr2 and chr11 was  identified. Furthermore, a search for chr21 risk CNVs for CHD was perfor   med using a customized chr21 array of 135K probes across 55 DS AVSD  and 53 DS controls. It revealed two CNV regions (FDR,0.04) in previously  defined CHD minimal region, and another CNV (FDR,0.03) upstream of PO  FUT2. We propose that the CHD risk of DS is complex and determined by specific SNPs and CNVs variations on chr21 and interaction of non chr21 genomic variants.  R. Sailani:  None. P. Makrythanasis: None.

591,"15q11.2 microdeletion (BP1 BP2) and developmental delay, behaviour issues, epilepsy and congenital heart disease: a series of 49 patients",P05.005,,"Chromosome 15âs proximal long arm is a region rich in duplicons, defining ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 157Back to index five breakpoints for 15q rearrangements. 15q11.2 microdeletion between  BP1 and BP2 has been previously associated with developmental delay  and behaviour issues. This region contains four highly conserved and non  imprinted genes: NIPA1, NIPA2, CYFIP1, TUBGCP5. Our goal is to refine the  phenotype associated with this microdeletion in a large cohort of patients. Prevalence of this CNV is 0.8% in patients presenting with developmental  delay, behaviour issues and/or multiple congenital malformations, analysed by array CGH in 4 different French Genetic laboratories. After exclusion of patients presenting an associated genetic alteration (known CNV, aneuplo   idy or point mutation in a known gene), we collected data from 49 unrelated patients.67.5% of the patients presented with mild or moderate developmental de   lay, 82% had speech impairment and 60% had behaviour issues (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, Autistic Spectrum Disorder or Obsessi   ve Compulsive Disorder). Seizures were described in 19% of the patients  and 16% had an associated non specific congenital heart disease. Parents were analysed in 55 % of the families. In those families, 29 % of the microdeletions were inherited from one of both parents, who did not present any of the features associated with the deletion. Our results support the hypothesis that 15q11.2 (BP1 BP2) microdeletion  is associated with developmental delay, abnormal behaviour, generalised epilepsy and congenital heart disease, although this latter finding had not  been previously reported.

592,Systematic phenotyping of the 16p11.2 600 kb deletion and duplication carriers,P05.007,,"The ~600kb 16p11.2 deletions and duplications are among the most fre  quent genetic etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders. These recurrent  rearrangements are associated with mirror phenotypes such as obesity and  underweight, macro  and microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). In 16p11.2, as well as in other genomic disorders,  reports of variable expressivity and âincomplete penetranceâ have ham  pered genetic counseling and patient management.To better understand this variability, we compared the effects of deleti ons and duplications through a systematic assessment of large cohorts of  16p11.2 rearrangementsâ carriers (Simons VIP and Europe consortia: n,  287 del, 301 dup). The deletion consistently impacts neurodevelopment, regardless of ascertainment. It is associated with a decrease in full scale IQ (FSIQ) of two standard deviations and frequently causes specific language difficulties. Psychiatric co morbidities are present in the majority of carri   ers, and seizures are observed in 24% of deletion carriers. We identified an increased velocity of head circumference growth during infancy, which reca pitulates the well documented pattern seen in ASD. In contrast, duplication carriers have a broader range of IQ when compared with deletion carriers (increased rates of FSIQ below 50 and above 100: OR,3.5, p,0.002): this heterogeneity is associated in part with ascertainment method. The asso   ciation of the duplication with decreased head circumference is similarly influenced by ascertainment, suggesting that the phenotypic heterogeneity might be caused by an interaction between the duplication and other ge netic and/or environmental factors. Additional genetic variants that could underlie these observations are currently under investigation.  S. Lebon:  None. A. Maillard: None. K. Mannik: B.

The syndrome could also comprise autistic features, seizures or thermore gulation problems. Rare symtoms are hearing loss, genitourinary anomalies and congenital heart defect. Extremely rare is association of Phelan McDer   mid syndrome and hepatic failure in early childhood. There have been de  scribed only 2 patients with this condition so far. In these cases PIM3 gene  (localized in 22q13.33) was considered to be responsible. We present 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with Phelan McDermid syn drome. Age at diagnosis ranges from 10 month to 55 years and deletion ex   tent varies from 0.4 Mb to 7.6 Mb. All patients present common features  of the syndrome, but they differ in inconstant sypmtoms. Any correlations  between phenotype and deletion range havenâ²t been observed.Patients have been diagnosed using FISH and MLPA, deletion extents were  proven by oligonucleotide arrayCGH. There are 6 patients with deleted PIM3 gene in our group, including two adult patients, but only one of these patients (10 year old boy with 1.9 Mb  long deletion) has developed hepatic failure recently. Therefore simple PIM3  deletion doesnâ²t seem to be the cause of hepatic failure.The possible mechanism is an alteration of the gene on the other allele, epi genetic factors or mutation in some modifier genes.

Here we report a five year old girl with mental and motor retarda  tion, epilepsy, and dysmorphic findings with normal constitutional karyo  type. To determine the genetic contribution in the development of clinical findings, aCGH analysis was performed. Roche NimbleGen Human CGH ISCA  Plus 3x1.4M Array was used for aCGH analysis. The data were analyzed by  using Nexus6 software (BioDiscovery). As a result of aCGH analysis, 5 chro mosomal regions were marked as important regions. Among these regions, one of them has been found to be related with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, previously. Microdeletion in the PTCHD1 locus on  Xp22.11 has been has been found in autism spectrum patients but not in he alty controls. However, we found a 24.3kb copy gain in the same locus in our patient. This finding showed that PTCHD1 locus may not be disrupted with  deletion only, copy gain in that region might also have effect on the gene, and its function. Also, other identified copy gains and loss may have contributed to the accompanying dysmorphic findings.

614,Custom designed CGH array in autism spectrum disorders,P05.030,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a complex multifac torial etilogy. Recently, copy number variants (CNVâs) have been shown to contribute to over 10% of ASD cases. Many of the known genes whose mutations cause ASD, have functions related to epigenetic regulation. We have applied a custom designed oligo array CGH with an exonic overlapping coverage of 450 genes known to cause autism or intellectual disability and autism candidate genes related to epigenetic machinery.Material and methods: Custom oligonucleotide arrays (formats 4x44 and 8x60) were designed with e Array Agilent technology. The final array design contains: 36,000 exonic probes for 450 genes considered of high priority (mean distance between probes 25bp), 2,000 probes for regulatory ele ments and microRNAâs and 22,000 whole genome probes (backbone).Results: We have studied a series of 139 patients including syndromic au   tism and/or familial cases of idiopathic autism. We have found 24 cases with pathological CNVâs. Most are non recurrent CNV, what allow us to propose new candidate genes involved in autism.Discussion: Our results confirm the importance of three regions in autism: Xq28 (MECP2), 22q13 (SHANK3) and 16q13, while all others regions are extremely heterogeneous.

Deletions of chromo   some 15q11.2 (BP1 BP2 region) including CYFIP1, NIPA1, NIPA2  and TUBG  CP5, are associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism. CYFIP1  is an important binding partner of FMRP and FMR1 muta   tions cause Fragile X syndrome, often associated with autism (30%). Also, patients with the Prader Willi phenotype caused by paternal deletions of the 15q11 13 BP1 BP3 region present a more severe behavioral phenotype ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 163Back to index (ADHD, autism and OCD) compared to those having the BP2 BP3 deletion.  Together, this pinpoints the 15q11.2 deleted region as a risk variant for  ASD. Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction is used to test the oc currence of deletions of CYFIP1 in ASD patients with intellectual disability  (IQ<70), ASD patients with normal intelligence (IQ>70) and controls. We also performed exome sequencing on two ASD families with the proband carrying the del15q11.2, inherited from a normal parent.We present the results of an association study of CYFIP1 deletions in ASD  patients. Given the variability of the phenotype of del15q11.2, we hypothe size that additional variants in the other allele, genes of the FMRP network or known ASD genes can contribute to the phenotype (multi hit model). We  present the results of exome sequencing of two ASD families, searching for  additional hits.The 15q11.2 deletion is likely to be a risk factor for ASD with/without men  tal retardation.

Background: The genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates.Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort. The sample contains 161 families ascertained through one or more autistic probands with normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability. The study cohort contains 648 individuals: 227 probands, 324 parents, 97 unaffected siblings belonging to 161 families. All probands, unaffected siblings and parents are genotyped with high resolution Illumina OMNI 2.5 8v1 microarrays. For all individuals, an extensive list of phenotypic information is collected inclu   ding IQ, SRS scores, 3DI, clinical genetic examination and family history.Results:We present the results of a family based study on the validity of CNV de   tection in ASD using a high resolution platform. We study the segregation of known and novel rare CNVs with qualitative and quantitative autism phenotypes. Additionally association studies are performed with respect to amongst others gene content and parental origin.Conclusion:With this study we aim to contribute to the clinical validation of the current knowledge of ASD risk variants and to the identification of novel variants.

The proband was referred with a history of proportionate short stature, hypotonia, delay in speech and fine motor skills, ptosis and facial dysmor   phism. Array CGH was performed using the BlueGnome Cytochip oligo ISCA 8 x 60K array platform. Array CGH revealed a de novo interstitial deletion  at chromosome 7q11.22 involving exons 3   5 of AUTS2  and no other copy  number variants.

Previous publica   tions describe a number of individuals with disruptions involving AUTS2   who present with developmental delay/ intellectual disability, hypotonia and autism. Early cases all resulted from translocations or inversions which disrupted other genes in addition to AUTS2 and made it difficult to attribute  the phenotype to AUTS2 alone. The patient described in our report (and a re  cent report of another two patients) who have intragenic deletions of AUTS2 with no other CNVs provides strong evidence that disruption of AUTS2  alone  results in a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder.

648, BKCa channels: a new therapeutic target in Fragile X Syndrome treatment,P05.067,,"The most common cause of inherited mental deficiency (MD) associated  with autistic features, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), results from the FMR1 gene  silencing and loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Among synaptic proteins deregulated by the absence of Fmrp in fmr1  knock out  (KO) mice (murine model for FXS), Kcnma1 (Î± subunit of large conductance Ca 2+ activated potassium channels, BKCa) seems to be the most significant  deregulated one. Since several papers showed an involvement of BKCa chan nels in MD, this channel could be a new therapeutic target for FXS. The objectives of this study were: 1) to characterize the molecular BKCa channel anomaly in fmr1  KO mouse model and 2) to evaluate the thera  peutic effect of a BKCa channel opener molecule (BCOM), BMS 204352, on dendritic spines maturation of fmr1  KO neurons and on social behavior of  fmr1  KO mice. In fmr1  KO mice, Kcnma1 protein quantity was lower in ce  rebral structures and neurons, and associated with a reduced BKCa whole cell current. In vitro addition of BMS 204352 induced dendrite spines ma  turation of fmr1  KO neurons. In vivo, using a behavioral test of direct social  interaction, a single injection of BMS 204352 rescued affiliative behaviors to wild type level. In conclusion, we demonstrated 1) a Kcnma1 protein anomaly in fmr1  KO  mice inducing a decrease in BKCa whole cell current, and 2) that a BCOM, BMS 204352, restored a regular phenotype of dendrite spines and social interaction in fmr1  KO mice.

A genotype phenotype correlation?,P05.070,,"Phelan McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the deletion or disruption of a 22q13 region containing the post synaptic protein gene SHANK3 . The clinical features of PMS (also known  as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and otherdevelopmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmor   phic features. Other less frequent features include seizures, brain, renal and cardiac malformations, motor deficits, and lymphedema Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, Clinical expression also varies widely, even among patients with small deletions, and no correlation between deletion size and phenotype has been found. A role for additional genetic factors, in addition to SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, is likely. Because PMS is considered  to be underdiagnosed, the true prevalence is unknown. Aims. We aim to define a possible genotype phenotype comparison to use  high resolution deletion breakpoint mapping on a large cohort of patients, addressed the hypothesis that additional genes or regions of chromosome  22q13 besides SHANK3 may contribute to the PMS phenotype. Results.

Whole exome sequencing of ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 173Back to index gDNA from the boy and his parents identified a de novo, novel variant in  HDAC1 (c.154N>S) which was not detected in public or 1100 private exome  databases. Expression of HDAC1 was reduced by 40% while expression of  HDAC4, RAI1 and MBD5 in the probandâs peripheral blood lymphocytes was normal. Taken together, these data suggest that this novel HDAC1 mutation prevents  transcription repression leading to autism, developmental delay and epi lepsy in this patient. Direct DNA sequencing of gDNA from additional pa tients with autism +/  epilepsy and normal copy number state of HDAC1 is  underway.  M.J. Dasouki: None. J. Roberts: None. W. Zeng:  A.

654," Identification of a novel missense mutation in HUWE1 (Xp11.2) segregating with intellectual disability in a large family, by Targeted High Throughput Sequencing.",P05.073,,"Genetic diagnosis in Intellectual Disability (ID) remains difficult because of the extreme genetic heterogeneity of this frequent condition. We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p.Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1  gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in  3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1  have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy   en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense  was recently observed in a boy with autism spectrum disorder but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p.Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family. A functional test of HUWE1   activity on DNA repair is currently performed on patientâs cells to confirm its pathogenicity.  Y. Alembik: None. J. Lauer Zillhardt:  None. B. Gerard: None. C.

Almost all of the published 22q13 deletions have been described as terminal. It is estimated that SHANK3  gene, which maps to 22q13 region, is the major candidate gene  for the neurologic features of the syndrome. Four cases with interstitial de   letions of 22q13 are reported previously.We report on a 7 year old boy with ID, autistic behavior; abnormal EEG, spa sticity and mild dysmorphic features included ptosis, facial asymmetry, pro minent ears, clinodactyly of F5, T2 3 syndactyly.

660,Distal 16p11.2 duplication in two patients with intellectual disability,P05.080,,"Several recurrent rearrangements have been described at 16p11.2 locus. Deletions and duplications of a proximal 600 kb region (29.5 30.1 Mb) have  been associated with autism, intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and mir   ror metabolic phenotypes. In addition, deletions of an adjacent, distal 200  kb region (28.7 28.9 Mb) have been associated with obesity and develop  mental delay. Here we describe two male patients presenting with mental  retardation and carrying the reciprocal distal 16p11.2 duplication, identi fied by whole genome SNP array (HumanCytoSNP 12, Illumina) in one case and CGH array (Agilent, 180K) in the other one. The first patient displayed intellectual disability, motor delay, attention defi   cit, dysmorphic features and dextrocardia. He had average height and weight.  The duplication (200 kb, 28.7 28.9 Mb) was inherited from his father. The  second patient presented with intellectual disability, severe language delay,  mild hand tremor but without dysmorphic features. His height was average, and his weight within low normal range (10 th percentile). The duplication  (285 kb, 28.7 29.0 Mb) was inherited from his mother, while there was a marked history of language disorders for his father and paternal family.These two observations suggest that the distal 16p11.2 duplication may be a risk factor for intellectual disability. One or few genes included in the duplicated region could be dosage sensitive. However, it is likely that unde termined, additional hits contribute to the phenotype of these patients, as indicated by the transmission of the duplication by an unaffected parent, the informative family history of the second patient, and the phenotypic diffe rences between the two patients.

669,A wide spectrum of intellectual disability in two siblings with a 6p22.3 p23 microdeletion encompassing JARID2,P05.089,,"Interstitial deletions of 6p22 6p24 are associated with a variable phenotype including intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder, hypotonia and congenital abnormalities. There are many potential disease causing genes in this region, including JARID2, DTNBP1, ATXN1, and MYLIP , and delinea ting genotype phenotype correlations has been a challenge. It has been sug gested that deletions of JARID2, a DNA binding transcriptional repressor expressed in embryonic and adult neurones, are associated with a characte ristic facial appearance as well as intellectual disability.Our first patient presented with mild to moderate learning disability and some Marfanoid systemic features, scoring 6/20 on the revised Ghent cri   teria. Cardiac and ophthalmic investigations were normal. CGH microarray identified a 1.2Mb microdeletion on chromosome 6p22.3 p23 involving JARID2 and DTNBP1 only; targeted microarray and FISH studies did not identify this deletion or a predisposing rearrangement in either parent. The patientâs younger brother presented with much more severe learning disabilities and autistic spectrum disorder. He had no similar skeletal fea tures but both boys had similar prominent supraorbital ridges. Investigation with CGH microarray found the same microdeletion, suggesting low level somatic gonadal mosaicism or true gonadal mosaicism as a cause for the two affected siblings.This case illustrates the wide spectrum of learning difficulties and behaviou ral difficulties that may be seen even in siblings with identical small micro deletions in this region. This may represent a challenge to the establishment of a clinically recognisable phenotype for JARID2 deletions and highlights the complexity of the genetic aetiology of intellectual disability.

670, Further delineation of medical and behavioural aspects of the KBG syndrome caused by ANKRD11 mutations,P05.090,,"Introduction Recently ANKRD11  mutations were identified as the cause of  KBG syndrome, an autosomal dominant intellectual disability (ID) syndro me with specific dental, craniofacial and skeletal anomalies. To further ex   pand the phenotypic spectrum and knowledge on medical and behavioural  management, we present a comprehensive overview of clinical and molecu  lar characteristics of nine so far unreported cases from five different families  with ANKRD11  aberrations. Methods Clinical features of nine cases with KBG syndrome were evaluated  and a review of the existing literature on KBG syndrome was performed.  Sequence analysis of the ANKRD11  gene was performed using Sanger se   quencing. An Affymetrix CytoScan HD array was used according to the  manufacturerâs protocol. Results In the first family a heterozygous frameshift mutation in ANKRD11   was identified in four affected children as well as their mother. Three other  isolated KBG syndrome patients all harboured frameshift mutations in AN  KRD11 . Microarray analysis revealed a 100 kb deletion encompassing exons  1 3 of the ANKRD11  gene in one patient. Discussion Hallmark characteristics of KBG syndrome are mild to mode   rate ID, macrodontia and other dental anomalies, skeletal anomalies, short  stature and typical dysmorphic features. Less common features are heart  defects, palatal defects, hearing loss, ophtalmologic abnormalities and cen tral nervous system involvement. Neurobehavioural problems, especially autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, are often present but gained less attention so far in medical literature. However, we observed that these can be severe and require adequate management. Better recognition, a multidisciplinary approach and early intervention are essential to patients and their families.

678,MBD5 alteration by multiple mutational mechanisms leads to variable phenotypic outcomes,P05.098,,"Just recently, partial or complete deletion of methyl CpG binding domain 5 (MBD5) gene has been implicated as causative in the phenotype associated with 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome. The core phenotype observed inclu   des intellectual disability (ID), seizures, significant speech impairment and autistic like symptoms. In the course of systematic whole genome screening of individuals with unexplained ID by array based comparative genomic hy   bridization, we identified de novo intragenic deletions of only the 5â non coding region of MBD5 in three patients leading, as previously documented, to haploinsufficiency of MBD5. In addition, we described two patients with two different unreported MBD5 intragenic duplications. The first one leads to the presence of numerous aberrant transcripts with premature termina tion codon. The second one is inherited from a healthy parent suggesting either this duplication is unrelated to the phenotype or this mutated allele in not fully penetrant. To further elucidate the involvement of MBD5 in ID, we sequenced coding and non coding exons in a selected cohort of 78 sub jects with a phenotype reminiscent of 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome. We identified for the first time a de novo nonsense mutation associated with a much more damaging phenotype without walking and verbal speech at the age of 10 years. Besides this fully penetrant mutation, we identified four missense variants most often inherited from a healthy parent. One of these, the p.Gly79Glu variant, has been recently described as an allele risk for au   tism spectrum disorders. Taken together, our findings suggest MBD5 gene is sensitive to perturbation by multiple mutational mechanisms, leading to variable phenotypic outcomes.  C. Bonnet: None. A. Ali Khan: None. E.

Many environmental and genetic factors can cause MR, including premature  birth, prenatal infections, chromosomal abnormalities, and single gene mu tations. Though an etiology can be established in 60 75% of cases of severe  MR, it is only 38 55% in mild cases. Moreover, genetically determined MR  accounts by for 17 to 41% of cases, depending on use of the different tech   niques. In the present study, we report the cryptic genomic rearrangements identified MR cases by selective use of chromosomal microarray. Methodology: Two cases of unexplained MR after initial biochemical, radio  logical and chromosomal evaluation were studied. DNA was extracted from whole blood and analysed on Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12 array. Raw data  obtained was analysed with KaryoStudio software. The rearrangements  were checked in DECIPHER database.Results and Conclusion: Both the samples showed a male karyotype and some cryptic genomic rearrangements. First case had multiple rearran gements duplications in the chromosome 7q11.21 (398kb) and 17q12 (186kb), and 1.6Mb hemizygous deletion at cytoband 14q13.3 q21.1.

All these regions (non recurrent genomic aberrations) have been implicated as pathogenic in several other patients as per DECIPHER database.

MedykÃ³w 18,,  Katowice, Poland. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of familial mental retar dation and one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation respon   sible for FXS is a large expansion of the CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1  gene resulting in its transcriptional silencing. Leptin may be  considered a cytokine like hormone with pleiotropic actions since it may be involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions, immune system, in addition to its role in development. Leptin and adiponectin may act in parallel as opposing metabolic counterparts. Thus, we hypothesized on in volvement of adiponectin in the pathophysiology of autism.Material and methods23 male patients, mean age 19,3 Â± 6,6, affected by Fragile X syndrome (full mutation in the FMR1  gene), were enrolled into the study. Controls were 24  healthy males, mean age 21,8 Â± 5,8. Plasma leptin and adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA method.ResultsPlasma leptin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients were similar as in con trol group (11,53 Â± 10,24 ng/ml) vs (5,73 Â± 4,52) were not significantly dif   ferent from those found in controls (p , 0,5).While plasma adiponectin levels in Fragile X syndrome patients (6,68 Â± 3,44 ng/ml) were significantly lower in controls (8,95 Â± 4,24) (p< 0,04).ConclusionAdiponectin may be involved in autistic features observed in FXS patients in light of its anti inflammatory properties.

689, 20 ans aprÃ¨s: a second family with mutation in X linked monoamine oxidase A gene affecting cognition and behavior,P05.109,,"Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by an extraordinary genetic he terogeneity, with more than 200 genes implicated in monogenic forms. This complexity precluded systematic testing for mutations and because clini cal features are often non specific, for some of these genes only few cases or families have been unambiguously documented. It is the case of the the X linked gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), for which only one nonsense mutation has been identified in Brunner syndrome, characterized in one unique family by borderline ID and impulsive and aggressive behavi ors. We have developed targeted NGS sequencing of 220 ID genes in patients with undiagnosed ID. We identified a p.C266F missense mutation in MAOA in a boy with autistic features and behavioral disturbances. He has good ver   bal comprehension but IQ could not be measured due to attention deficit and heterogeneous results in WISC IV test. Two maternal uncles carry the mutation and have severe ID, with a history of maltreatment in early child hood. The phenotype overlaps with Brunner syndrome. This novel missense mutation decreases MAOA activity, as shown by abnormal levels of urinary monoamines and by measurement of enzymatic activity. The identification of this point mutation confirms, for the first time since 1993, the monogenic implication of the MAOA gene in ID, autistic features and behavioral abnor malities. Variable expressivity might be due to environmental factors. We will discuss possible therapeutic options and hypotheses that could account for the very long time lag between the initial and highly publicized report and the finding of a second family.  A.

MYT1L interacts directly with  DISC1, which is involved in schizophrenia. We describe a family in which  the father, his son and his daughter have a 549 kb interstitial duplication in the 2p25.3 region detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and  confirmed by quantitative PCR. This duplication encompasses the five first  exons and is predicted to disrupt the MYT1L gene. The phenotype includes:  slight facial features including bulbous nasal tip, wide mouth, overfolded helix, strabismus, moderate intellectual disability (ID) with speech impedi   ment, hypotonia, hyperactivity, mood disorder with aggressive behaviour, neonatal feeding difficulties followed by a tendency to hyperphagia with overweight and a prominent abdomen with thick panniculus adiposus. Par  tial deletions of chromosome band 2p25.3 encompassing the MYT1L gene  have been reported in patients presenting with ID and overweight whereas  duplications disrupting the MYT1L gene have been reported in patients pre  senting with autism and schizophrenia. Moreover, single nucleotide poly   morphisms (SNPs) of MYT1L contribute to major depressive disorder and  schizophrenia.

In humans, this  protein family is encoded by five genes, NLGN1,  2,  3,  4 and  4Y. Several  recent studies have implicated NL in autistic disorders and mental retar  dation. The functional role predicts that mutations and/or polymorphisms in NLGN genes may be implicated in the development of neuropsychiatric  disorders. We describe two brothers born to non consanguineous parents, with a fa mily history of mental retardation (elder brother 16 years old). Both had showed delayed psychomotor development and language disorders; phe  notypic examination were negative except for long and asymmetric face;  clinodactyly of the 5th finger of hands were present only in the second brot her.

According to recent studies alteration in NRXN1 (2p16.3) and NLGN4 (Xp22.3) genes can pre  dispose to the wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including autistic spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, speech and language de   lay, hypotonia and schizophrenia. NRXN1 as one of the largest known human  genes (1,1 Mb) tends to frequent intragenic alterations. Whole genome ge notyping was performed using the Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1.We present 3 children of comparable age (5 6 year old), having different size of microdeletion in isoform alpha1 NRXN1 gene (40   360 kb ) and slightly  different phenotype. All children had mild to moderate mental retardation, two of them had speech delay and anxiosity, hypotonia and facial dysmor   phism. Two of detected deletions were intronic, the third deletion covered exones 1 to 11 of NRXN1. As the deletion in the NRXN1 may not be fully  penetrant, we examine also parental DNA.Microduplication (300 kb) spanning the exones 1,2 and 3 of NLGN4 gene  was found in 22 year old patient with hyperkinetic syndrome, attention failure, but without mental retardation.

694,Genotype phenotype correlations of NRXN1 deletions,P05.114,,"Chromosomal microarray is now a key diagnostic test for patients with de   velopmental disabilities. This analysis led us to the identification of intra genic deletions of the NRXN1 (neurexin 1) gene, in eight unrelated patients  with intellectual disability (8/8), speech delay (8/8), autism spectrum dis   orders (5/8) and epilepsy (2/8). The size of these deletions varies from 50 to 600 kb.The NRXN1 gene encodes a protein that belongs to a family of cell adhesion  molecules and plays a fundamental role in synaptic function. NRXN1 tran scription results in two isoforms Î± and Î². The Î± neurexins are transcribed from a promoter located upstream of exon 1, while the Î² neurexins are tran  scribed from an intragenic downstream promoter. The main majority of our deletions (7/8) alter the Î± isoform only, and five of them involve exonic sequences whereas three deleted intronic regions only.One case occurred de novo. Two cases are familial ones and the exonic de   letion is inherited from one parent who presented learning difficulties. The five other cases are inherited from an asymptomatic parent or do not segre gate with the phenotype in the siblings, even if the deletion involves exonic  regions. This heterogeneity of genotype phenotype correlations of intragenic NR  XN1 deletions implies that the greatest care must be taken in the cytogenetic  report, and that deletions of this gene may participate in the phenotype but  are probably not sufficient to give rise to the neurodevelopmental disorder.

Since there is a weak correlation between the mutation type in the Xq28 disease gene MECP2/X inactivation status and phenotypic variability, we used this disea   se as a model to unveil the complex nature of a monogenic disorder. Exome sequencing was used to analyze the functional portion of the genome of two pairs of sisters with RTT . Although each pair had the same MECP2 muta   tion and balanced X inactivation, one individual from each pair could not speak or walk, and had a profound ID (classical RTT), while the other could speak and walk, and had a moderate ID (Zappella variant). In addition to the MECP2 mutation, each patient has a group of variants predicted to im pair protein function. The classical RTT girls, but not their milder affected sisters, have an enrichment of variants in genes related to oxidative stress, muscle impairment and ID and/or autism.

706, Characterization of novel âde novoâ mutation in the SLC6A8 gene,P05.127,,"Introduction: Cerebral creatine deficiency is an X linked disorder caused by mutations in the SLC6A8  gene (Xq28). It consists of 13 exons and encodes a  protein of 635 amino acids. This disorder causes an increase of creatine le vels in urine and plasma, and urinary creatine/creatinine ratio. The clinical presentation of males affected is mental retardation, expressive speech and language delay, epilepsy, developmental delay and autistic behaviour.Subjects and Methods: An 8 year old male patient presents learning diffi   culties, behaviour disorder and epilepsy. An increase of creatine/creatinine ratio, guanidineacetate and glycine levels (plasma and urine) was detected. The 13 exons of the SLC6A8 gene, including the intron exon junctions, were  analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction.Results: We detected a 34 pb deletion (c.1016+11_1017 52del34) in intron 6, that was predicted to cause an aberrant splicing into acceptor splice site. At the cDNA level, this mutation produces a 30 pb deletion in exon 7 and a single amino acid insertion (p. K339_S349delinsN). This variant was not detected in the mother and is therefore considered de novo.Discussion: DNA and RNA analysis were necessary to characterize this novel pathogenic mutation. The detected change in the creatine transporter could be responsible for a lower and/or no activity of the protein. Functional stu dies in cultured skin fibroblasts will be necessary to show  a deficiency of the  creatine transporter function.   J. Aguirre Lamban: None. C. Cervera Acedo:  None. E. Sarasola: None.

Comparative genomic hybridization showed a duplica   tion at 15q11.2 q13.1. A similarly affected sister (autism spectrum disorder, anxiety and intellectual impairment) and their clinically depressed mother also carried the duplication. The mother has normal intellect. Another clini cally depressed sibling with normal intellect did not carry the duplication. Methylation studies showed that the duplication had been inherited from the maternal grandfather who had normal intellect and absence of psych iatric disease.Duplication of 15q11 q13 has previously been associated with cognitive impairment, autism, and psychiatric disease. Furthermore, the maternally inherited duplication most likely confers this phenotype whereas paternally derived duplications primarily show normal phenotypes.Our family provides additional evidence that autism, psychiatric disease and intellectual disability segregate with a maternally inherited duplication at 15q11 q13 although with variable presentation. The presence of depression in the non carrier sister however, suggests a lack of association between cli nical depression and the chromosomal duplication in this family, providing evidence that this duplication does not play a strong role in depression.

We selec ted high confidence CNVs (detected by 3 algorithms) not overlapping more than 20% with CNVs in 8000 controls.We identified 165 CNVs in 132 individuals, 78% with only one CNV. CNVs ranged from 5 kb to 3 Mb, and 67% were deletions. However, genic CNVs, which represented 53% of all CNVs, were more frequently duplications (65%). Genic CNVs integrated between 1 and 17 genes, and included genes implicated in ASD etiology like NRXN1 and CHD2, as well as novel genes.  CNVs were mainly inherited, with only 10% de novo. We further evaluated the presence of autistic traits in parents, using appro priate questionnaires, and the type of inheritance of the CNV (inherited vs  de novo). We observed a significant excess of autistic traits in the fathers  that transmitted CNVs, mainly for the âaloofâ personality, defined as lak   king interest in social interaction. Analysis of familial correlation data from  parents and probands showed a significant correlation between parents. We  therefore show evidence for an excess of subthreshold autistic traits in CNV transmitting parents of children with ASD, particularly for paternal trans mission. We also observed a tendency for assortative mating in families of  affected individuals, in particular for inherited CNVs. We conclude that a large fraction of CNVs are inherited and correlate with autistic traits in parents in the studied sample.  I.C. ConceiÃ§Ã£o: None. C. Correia: None. B. Oliveira: None. M.M.

However, a great deal of the heritable variation associated with common traits remains unaccounted for within the geno me. The objective of this study is to discover large parts of additive gene tic variance not typically associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through GWAS in Korean population and estimates of ASD heritability.Subjects with ASD were recruited through the Korean Autism Genetic Study Consortium. Each child was diagnosed as ASD by using the Korean versions of ADOS and ADI R (Lord et al. 1994; Lord et al. 1997).Total 146 patients were genotyped on the Affymetrix 5.0 platform. Geno   type data for n,858 sex matched controls were drawn from the Korea As sociation Resource database. Genotype data were filtered for <5% missing   ness/sample or /SNP; MAF >0.01; HWE p>0.0001. Cases were verified as unrelated using identity by descent estimation in PLINK v1.07. In order to examine the missing heritability in ASD, we applied genome wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) to 142 case and 842 controls after data filtering.The results identified phenotypic variants of 84.5% (Â±0.313 SE) with affec ted status of ASD, 7.0% (Â±0.027 SE) with topGWAS SNPs (Â± 1mb region) and 81.0%(Â± 0.313 SE) with nonGWAS SNPs. Increase from the genetic variance identified by top GWAS hits region indicates there might be more risk loci to be identified. Our results suggest that many common variants of small effect remain to be discovered, although GWAS is useful in identifying the most common variants associated with ASD.  J.E. Park: None. S.A.

In a genome wide CNVs screening performed by the AGP , a rare inherited  microdeletion, disrupting two genes transcribed in the same direction,  KLHL23 and SSB, was identified in an Italian ASD individual. This deletion, potentially resulting in a gene fusion transcript, causes a frameshift with the  introduction of a premature stop codon. No fusion transcript was detected  by RT PCR, suggesting that it is subject to ânonsense mediated mRNA decayâ. KLHL23 encodes for a brain expressed Kelch repeat protein of unknown function. While several CNVs affecting SSB are reported in controls making  it an unikely dosege sensitive gene, no CNVs have been previously described  in KLHL23.

The whole genome SNP array (Human CytoSNP 12, Illumina) analysis revealed a de novo 11q13.3q13.4 deletion (69,789,180 71,783,240) of 1.9 Mb encompassing 6 referenced OMIM genes including SHANK2. In addition, the patient carried an intermediate CGG re ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2013 | PARIS, FRANCE | WWW.ESHG.ORG 194Back to index peat length at the Fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) locus inherited from  his mother.

734,Mosaic copy number variation in the autism and schizophrenia brain: providing a basis for a new (mitotic) theory of neuropsychiatric diseases,P06.13,,"A plethora of data on germ line genomic rearrangements in brain disorders including autism and schizophrenia does exist. On the other hand, the con  tribution of non heritable genomic alterations to the pathogenesis is hardly  appreciated. Here, we have assessed post zygotic autosomal aneuploidy in prefrontal cortex of the diseased and normal brain by molecular cytogenetic  techniques (FISH and interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding  with DNA probes for chromosomes 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18). Twel  ve autistic, 19 schizophrenic and 27 control samples provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental disorders, University of Maryland and bank of our institute were analyzed. Aneuploidy rate per autosome was 0.3  0.8% in all three cohorts analyzed (0.46%, 0.62% and 0.59%). However, we  observed statistically significant increase of chromosome 9 aneuploidy in  the autistic brain. In schizophrenia, chromosome 1 and 18 aneuploidy rates were significantly increased. Additionally, we performed array CGH and in silico analysis of our data on genomic rearrangements in childhood neuro  developmental diseases (124 individuals) and found that CNV burdens in  these individuals typically affect two pathways specific for brain cells: cell  cycle regulation and programmed cell death. We concluded that somatic genome variation (chromosome specific mosaic aneuploidy) is a non heri   table genetic factor contributing to pathogenesis of brain disorders, that is,  however, a result of specific CNV burdens. Our data provide a basis for a new  (mitotic) theory of neuropsychiatric diseases. Supported by the President of  the Russian Federation Grant MD 4401.2013.7 and RFBR 12 04 00215 Ð°.  I.Y.

735,Synaptic transmission: looking for clues to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) etiology in Copy Number Variants containing synaptic genes,P06.15,,"Copy Number Variants (CNVs) play an important role in susceptibility to  ASD, often mediated by the deletion or duplication of genes involved in  synaptic structure and function. In this study we tested the hypothesis that  there is an enrichment in CNVs encompassing synaptic transmission genes in ASD.To obtain a list of genes involved in synaptic structure and function, we que ry pathway databases for synaptic pathways (KEGG and GO). By intersecting this list with the results of a large CNV genomic screening in ASD patients (performed by the Autism Genome Project), and CNV information on the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), we found a significantly increased bur den of CNVs encompassing synaptic genes in ASD subjects compared to DGV controls (Fisher exact test P,2.2X10  16, OR,1.47). Detailed analysis of the frequencies of each synaptic gene duplicated or de   leted by CNVs in ASD and control subjects identified 39 genes that were si gnificantly more frequent in ASD (P<0.05). Closer inspection of CNV overlap between the ASD sample and additional control databases (eg SAGE, Pop Gene) highlighted synaptic structure or function genes (eg NF1, GABRG1,  CHRNA7 ) that warrant further investigation. Additionally, 5 synaptic genes,  PLA2G1B, PPP2R3C, KCNK7, ADCY7 and RAPSN , were disrupted by CNVs ex   clusively in the ASD dataset, and were also absent from the additional con trol CNV databases queried.The present results show an excess of structural alterations encompassing synaptic genes in ASD and highlight candidate genes for sequencing and functional studies.

He is the first child of non consanguineous parents. Chromosomal ana   lysis had revealed a normal male karyotype 46,XY, and testing for fragile X syndrome and PTEN sequencing was inconspicuous.Array CGH analysis showed a microdeletion of 1.6Mb: arr 21q21.1 q21.2(22444986 24047363)x1. This part of the chromosome contains the entire NCAM2 gene and no other functional genes. His mother also carries  this microdeletion. She has no obvious behavioural features of autism, but also is macrocephalic. Three maternal blood relatives are reported to have speech problems. Results of psychological assessments of the mother and the other affected individuals are pending.Autism spectrum disorder (ASD, OMIM 209850) encompasses different forms of autism with a broader phenotype. Two thirds of all patients with ASD suffer from mental retardation. Among the genes involved, NCAM2 has  been assumed to play a role in the development of ASD because of its func tion in neurites (outgrowth, bundling).

737,Targeted high throughput gene sequencing of the NMDA receptor multi protein complex and high resolution genomic study of 100 families with autism spectrum disorder,P06.17,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early childhood neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a significant genetic aetiology and a prevalence  currently estimated at 1/100. Epidemiological studies described that ASDs  are heterogeneous at both clinical and genetic levels, which has been further illustrated by the large number of loci and genes that have been identified to  date (>100). Several biological pathways have been highlighted, particularly  the NMDA receptor multiprotein (NRC) complex, affected by copy number variations (CNV) and mutations enriched in NRC proteins encoding genes.We performed a global genetic study of 100 French families including at least 1 individual with ASD, which was included in the research project âNeurophysiological Molecular and Developmental Analysis of the Glutama   te Synapse in Autism (NMDA Autism)â (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).For each family, we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic compa rative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array for   mat to identify rare or de novo CNVs; Secondly, a high throughput targeted sequencing of 216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene mutations in our cohort.Preliminary results on CGH experiments led us to identify small rare CNVs in several known regions (20p12.1 MACROD2; 18q21.1 KATNAL2; 11p13.11) or novel potential candidates such as FRMPD4, GUCY2F and NXPH3.

738,Homozygous exonic deletion in CTNNA3 suggests a role for alfaT catenin in susceptibility to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs),P06.18,,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable, neurodevelopmen tal conditions, showing extreme genetic heterogeneity. While it is well esta blished that de novo genetic variation plays an important role in ASD risk, recent studies have demonstrated a convincing evidence of a rare recessive contribution to the heritability of ASDs.In the genome wide CNV study carried out by the Autism Genetic Consorti   um (AGP), we identified one homozygous deletion intersecting the CTNNA3 gene in an Italian proband with ASD and moderate intellectual disability (PIQ,50). This deletion includes a coding exon, leading to a putative frames hift and premature stop codon, inherited from both parents, each heterozy   gote for a deletion of slightly different length. The unaffected sister is also heterozygote for the deletion.CTNNA3 encodes for the alfaT catenin protein that has a crucial role in cel lular adherence showing suggestive association in GWAS and a de novo de   letion.Even if the frequency of exonic deletions of CTNNA3 is not significantly dif   ferent between ASDs cases and controls (17/2446 cases and 35/5097 con trols, P,.88), no homozygous exonic deletions were found in a sample of  5097 controls, suggesting that only the complete knockout of CTNNA3 could  cause or confer susceptibility for ASDs. Expression analysis of alfaT catenin and alfaN catenin proteins in mouse cortex and hippocampus (P0 P90), provided further support of a role of CTNNA3 in early mid fetal develop  ment of the brain. While the exact biological significance of CTNNA3 homozygous deletion is yet to be determined, we hypothesize that it could have clinical relevance to  the ASDs phenotype in this Italian patient.  E.

739, Copy number variant analysis using SNP microarrays identified novel candidate genes in patients with autism spectrum disorders,P06.19,,"Chenevier, CrÃ©teil, France. Copy number variants (CNVs) have repeatedly been found to cause or pre dispose to Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). For diagnostic purposes, we screened 194 patients with ASDs for CNVs using Illumina SNP arrays. In several patients, we also analyzed candidate genes located in inherited deletions to unmask autosomal recessive variants. Three CNVs, a de novo  triplication of chromosome 15q11 q12 of paternal origin, a deletion on chromosome 9p24 and a de novo 3q29 deletion, were identified as the cause  of the disorder in one patient each. We also identified multiple private or recurrent CNVs, the majority of which were inherited from asymptomatic parents. Finally, an autosomal recessive cause was considered in two pati   ents: a homozygous 1p31.1 deletion encompassing PTGER3  was identified  in a patient and a rare missense variant in DOCK10 was found in a second  patient in association with an inherited deletion that deleted the entire gene. Although highly penetrant CNVs or variants inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion were detected in rare cases, our results mainly support the hypothesis that CNVs contribute to ASDs in association with other CNVs or point variants located elsewhere in the genome. Identification of these gene tic interactions in individuals with ASDs constitutes a formidable challenge.  C. Nava: None. B. Keren: None. C. Mignot:  None. A. Rastetter:  None. S.

Background: Many genetic syndromes present with psychiatric disorders.  We aim to determine the role and prevalence of hidden genetic conditions  in patients with psychiatric disorders and comorbidities. This has the po  tential to significantly impact the standard of care and treatment of selected individuals with psychiatric impairment. Methods: We prospectively recruit  patients â¥16 years of age with psychiatric disorder(s) and at least one of  1) neurologic abnormality, 2) developmental delay (DD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or pervasive DD (PDD), 3) dysmorphic features, 4) conge nital anomalies or 5) family history of DD, ASD or PDD. A clinical database  of phenotypic correlates is being established to delineate the highest yield  data that lead to the most effective and efficient diagnosis of genetic syn dromes in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Results: Of the initial 62 patients recruited, 15 (24.2%) have been diagnosed with genetic condi   tions. This includes seven patients with six different single gene disorders, six patients with six distinct chromosomal variants and two patients with different metabolic disorders. Discussion: Our preliminary results have be gun to demonstrate that genetic syndromes are common in patients with primary psychiatric disorders. Many of the genetic conditions identified in this cohort have implications for medical surveillance, management and, in some cases, treatment. The high diagnostic yield in patients with âpsychia tric plusâ phenotypes demonstrates the significance of psychiatric disorders in genetic syndromes and vice versa.

A damaging de novo mu tation in this gene has recently been identified in a schizophrenia patient. However, duplications of this locus have also been described in healthy indi   viduals, thus complicating interpretation of such findings. Altogether, there is growing evidence suggesting a possibly incomplete penetrance as well as an important phenotypic variability of RB1CC1 associated disorders.We report on a 5 year old male, referred for initial genetic evaluation becau   se of psychomotor delay and ASD. On clinical examination the boy presented with marked truncal obesity and mild dysmorphic features. The proband underwent several neurologic evaluations for his delay as well as for an epi  sode of seizure, occurring in the context of a probable benign occipital epi  lepsy. At 9 years, he was reported to have severe anxiety and psychotic sym  ptoms, notably auditory hallucinations, with poor response to risperidone.Array CGH analysis showed a maternally inherited 444 kb duplication of 8q11.23 encompassing RB1CC1 and FAM150. Re evaluation of the family history revealed possible psychiatric symptoms  in his mother, as well as a maternal uncle suffering from chronic depression with psychotic episodes.

Sex chromosome aneuploidies increase the risk of spoken or written language disorders but, compared to other developmental disor   ders, e.g. autism, individuals with SLI or dyslexia do not routinely undergo cytogenetic analysis.To assess the frequency of sex chromosome aneuploidies within individuals with SLI or dyslexia, genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism geno typing was performed in three sample sets: a clinical cohort of individuals with SLI referred to a child development centre (87 probands), a replication cohort of individuals with SLI, from both clinical and epidemiological samp les (209 probands) and a set of individuals with dyslexia (310 probands).In the clinical SLI cohort, three abnormal karyotypic results were identified in probands, representing a proband yield of 3.4%. In the SLI replication co hort six abnormalities were identified providing a consistent proband yield (2.9%). In the sample of individuals with dyslexia, two sex chromosome ab   errations were found giving a lower proband yield of 0.6%. In total two XYY, four XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), three XXX, one XO (Turner syndrome) and one proposed XO/XY mosaic karyotype were identified.The frequency of sex chromosome aneuploidies within each of the three co horts was increased over the expected population frequency (approximate ly 0.1%) suggesting that genetic testing may prove worthwhile for individu als with language and literacy problems, enabling therapies associated with  these sex chromosome abnormalities to be implemented more promptly.

During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277   gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex   pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L   genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autistic spectrum dis   orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277  deletions. We observed  an increased frequency of ZNF277  deletions in probands with SLI (6/318,  1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen   dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277  in lymphoblastoid cell lines car  rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found  that, while ZNF277  microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do  not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi  crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 . Given these fin  dings, we postulate that ZNF277  microdeletions may contribute to the risk  of speech and language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risks previously described in this region.

843,Genomics of FXT AS (Fragile X associated Tremor Ataxia) mouse brains reveals hallmarks of altered neurodevelopmement and neurodegeneration.,P08.43,,"While FMR1 is silenced in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients carrying the full mutation, its expression is elevated (2 8 fold) in premutated individuals. The se subjects may develop the Fragile X associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia and parkinsonism. In addition, people carrying the premutation can be affected by a set of neurological and behavioural disorders during young age. Memory problems have been detected in these patients as well as in the mouse mo del for FXTAS. In those animals, by transcriptome analysis we have shown a profound deregulation of the expression levels of genes involved in learning, memory and autistic behavior, Parkinson disease and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest the presence of a synapthopathy (Zongaro et al., HMG, 2013). Furthermore, we studied gene expression profiles of whole brain ob tained from both young and old FXTAS mice. We observed that in this context different neurodegenerative pathways are involved at different ages. In FXTAS mice, we also studied the expression level of several microRNAs that target FMR1 mRNA and we observed that one them, miR 221, is down regulated  at the synapse of young FXTAS mice and in the full brain of the older ones.  Interestingly, many of those deregulated mRNAs at the synapse, as well as in whole brain, are target of miR 221. These findings suggest a network regula  tion   including miRNAs and mRNAs  for FMR1 mRNA.  S. Zongaro: None. R. Hukema: None. R. Willemsen: None. B. Mari: None. B.  Bardoni: None.",2013.0,,"S.

897,Serious neurologic entity in two unrelated patients with Xq13.1 duplication,P08.99,,"Onassis Public Benefit Foundation, Athens, Greece, 31st Department of  Pediatrics, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 43rd Department of  Pediatrics, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 51 st Department of  Pediatrics, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece. The use of array CGH substantially improves the diagnosis of chromosomal  abnormalities that are not evident by conventional karyotype. Recently in an extended family with global developmental delay and autistic features,  a novel Xq12 q13.3 duplication was identified which contained amongst  others TAF1, GJB1 genes .(Kaya et al.2012).The GJB1 gene is associated with  morphology of myelin sheath and peripheral neuropathy, while TAF1  has  been linked with torsion dystonia  3. We present the clinical and molecular findings in two unrelated patients  with Xq13.1 duplication. The first one is a 5 year old boy with truncal hy   potonia, low deep tendon reflexes and proximal weakness. The other pati   ent is a 16 year old boy with progressive difficulties in walking, tremor and  learning disorder, while his mother has an identical positive family history in three deceased males. High resolution 4X180K Agilent arrays used in the  study (> 236.000 probes, average resolution of 8.9 Kb) revealed a duplicati   on on Xq13.1 (0.423 Mb) containing the TAF1 and GJB1 genes in both pati   ents, while the second patient had an additional deletion on 17q21.31 (0.63  Mb) containing KANSL1  gene. To our knowledge this is the second report  of the Xq13.1 duplication extending the previously described phenotypic  spectrum in that a more serious neurologic entity could be attributed to the  TAF1 and GJB1 genes.

1369,Detection of allele specific gene expression on next generation sequencing data,P15.06,,"of Life and Reproduction Sciences,University of Verona, Verona, Italy, 2Dept. of  Biotechnology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy, 3Dept. of Pathology and Diagnostics,  University of Verona, Verona, Italy. Some studies observed that variation of gene expression between alleles is  common, and this variation may contribute to human variability of several  traits. The goal of our study is to develop a statistical framework aiming to  measure and detect allele specific gene expression (GE) differences from global GE experiments conducted using next generation sequencing (NGS)  technology. Our method for identification of allele specific differential ex   pression (ASDE) is based on the likelihood estimation of the observed data  depending on the parameter Î (the relative amount of the reference allele with respect to the alternative allele). ASDE was estimated by a Likelihood  Ratio Test (LRT). Only genes with at least two heterozygous sites were selec  ted. Currently we tested the method on a total of 7 mantle cell lymphoma samples (MCL), 12 muscle cell samples (MC) and 15 lymphoblastoid cell li  nes samples (LCL). Using an arbitrary threshold of LRT > 250 we observed  15, 22 and 33 ASDE genes for MCL, MC and LCL, respectively, on a total of 10910, 8357 and 13328 expressed genes. For MCL samples we observed 3  and 1 ASDE genes in common with MC and LCL, respectively. No common  ASDE genes were observed between MC and LCL. We plan to improve the method to identify haplotypes underlying ASDE, and to investigate the cor   relation between ASDE genes and their chromosomal location or specific classes of functionality. These bioinformatic results should be confirmed by wet lab experiments. In conclusion we developed a simple method to detect ASDE genes from NGS data.  V. Mijatovic:  None. L. Xumerle: None. E.

1452,Paternal age explains a major portion of de novo germline mutation rate variability in healthy individuals,P16.025,,"De novo mutations (DNM) are an important source of rare variants and are increasingly being linked to the development of many diseases. Recently, two studies using individuals with common psychiatric disorders, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or schizophrenia, have shown a strong link bet   ween the fathersâ age at time of conception and identified DNM hotspots across the genome1,2. Though they were both revealing, these studies were conducted on cohorts of patients with psychiatric disorders known to result in part from DNM. Using disease free familial quartets we show for the first time that the overall ratio of somatic:germline DNM is 1:9 and that there is a positive correlation between paternal age and germline DNM in healthy subjects. Interestingly somatic and all CNV DNM did not vary with paternal age. We also found that DNM were not evenly distributed across the genome, which adds support to the possibility of DNM hotspots.

1526,Rare Variant Extensions of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test Detects Associations with Autism Exome Sequence Data,P16.106,,"Many population based rare variant association tests have been developed to analyze sequence data. A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise   quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa   tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7  gene. Given  the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

1678, Developmental neuropsychological assessment of 4 5 years old children born following Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis,P19.57,,"Introduction:  Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a technique that  enables the prevention of affected embryo transfer for couples at risk of transmitting a genetic disorder to offspring. Due to its relative invasiveness it is essential to identify any adverse effects on the long term development of children born as a result of PGD.Aim: The aim of this study was to measure and evaluate developmental neu  ropsychological profiles of 4 5 year old children born after PGD relative to norms representing the general population.Materials and methods: Twenty seven, 4 5 year old, PGD children were recruited. Participants were subjected to a battery of neuropsychological assessments including: WPPSI III(cognitive development), PLS 4(language development), WRAVMA(visual motor abilities), CARS2(screening test for autistic spectrum disorders) and the Miles ABC Test(ocular dominance). Pa rental questionnaires regarding executive function and demographics were performed as well. Each subjectâs tests results were compared to each testâs norms as provided by the test authors. When available, Israeli norms were used for comparison.Results: Children born after PGD showed scores within the normal or above normal ranges for all developmental outcomes. The mean WPPSI Full Scale Intelligence Quotient and Verbal Intelligence Quotient were signi ficantly higher than the general population(P,0.013), although not clinically significant(100Â±15). All other tests performed within normal test ranges.Conclusions: This pilot study shows that children conceived after PGD dis   play normal developmental neuropsychological outcomes at age 4 5 years when compared to age matched normal children in the general population.

Thanks to higher testing resolution array technique reveals not only pathogenic ab   normalities, but also so called risk factors or susceptibility loci for intellec tual disability/developmental delay/autism spectrum disorders or epilepsy. Thus, more information about the (future) health of the unborn child can be obtained with this technique. We offered pregnant couples the choice bet   ween array results obtained by analysis at a 0,5 Mb or a 5 Mb resolution, the latter similar to that of karyotyping. The preliminary results of our pilot (n,30) are that 18% chose the 5 Mb resolution, 33% opted for 0.5 Mb reso   lution excluding risk factors and 47% opted for 0.5 Mb resolution including risk factors. Refusal to learn about risk factors was out of fear of becoming needlessly worried. Over 74% of couples indicated the wish to decide how  much information they desired about the (future) health of their unborn  child.So far, our results indicate that pregnant couples differed regarding their preferences. In addition all couples appreciated being offered the choice.

1811,A rare case of a complete 9p trisomy without autistic features and resulting from a de novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation,J02.03,,"Trisomy 9p is one of the most frequent autosomal anomalies compatible with long survival rate. The phenotype of the 9 p duplication syndrome is clinically recognizable, and phenotype/genotype correlations suggested that the critical region is located on 9p22. We report on a rare case of a tri somy for the whole short arm of chromosome 9 resulting from a de novo unbalanced t(9;15) translocation. A 3 year old girl was referred to genetic counselling because of facial dysmorphism, seizures, and moderate mental retardation. MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) was interpreted as normal. Chromosome analysis revealed a 46,XX,der(15)add(15)(p11) karyotype. Parental karyotypes were normal. Thus, we conclude that this chromosomal rearrangement occurred de novo. In order to identify this additional materi   al on chromosome 15, we performed array CGH (Nimbelgen Whole genome tiling135K HG18) that showed a duplication of the whole short arm of chro mosome 9. No other imbalances were found elsewhere in the genome. FISH studies performed with whole chromosome 15 and chromosome 9 painting probes confirmed that the chromosomal material added on chromosome 15 derived from 9p. Our observation is unique because the duplication of the whole short arm of chromosome 9 without monosomy of another chromo some and resulting from a de novo unbalanced translocation was never re ported.

1855,2q13.3 deletion syndrome in a newborn with ring chromosome 22 presenting with congenital hypotonia,J02.472,,"The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome or Phelan McDermid syndrome is characte rized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, absent to severely delayed speech, normal to accelerated growth with minor dismorphic fea tures such as dolichocephaly, large or unusual ears, long eye lashes, bulbous  nose, pointed chin, large hands and dysplastic toe nails. Most individuals  have moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic like beha viour and decreased pain perception. Frequency of the syndrome is equal in males and females while incidence is still unknown. Beside the simple de   letion, loss of 22q13.3 can also result from translocation, ring chromosome formation and other less common structural changes affecting the region containing SHANK3 gene on long arm of chromosome 22. The most features  of the syndrome thought to be the consequence of loss that specific gene. We present a case of female newborn with Phelan McDermid syndrome. The child was born on term, from first, uncomplicated pregnancy with un  remarkable family history. She was initially treated in NICU because of early  neonatal infection. Because of congenital hypotonia with mild facial dysmor   phic features genetic analysis were performed. The karyotype revealed ring  chromosome (22): 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13.3). A fluorescent in situ hybridisa   tion analysis was performed, indicating that the deletion encompassed the  critical 22q13.3 region.

1935, Pharmacogenetic Study of Second Generation Antipsychotic Therapy in Autism Spectrum Disorders,J06.05,,"Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are among the most  common children neurodevelopment disorders. ASD patients often have co morbid conditions, such us obsessive compulsive, sleep disorders, self  destructive behavior, increased irritability, aggression and self injury. One third of ASD patients take an antipsychotic medication. One of the most  popular second generation antipsychotic is risperidone. Two cytochrome  P450 genes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, are involved in metabolization of psy   chotropic medications.The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*41, CYP2C19*2 alleles in the case and control groups, and progno stic assessment of risperidone therapy in association with defined alleles.Methods: Ninety five patients with ASD participated in the study. The con  trol group consisted of 190 healthy, non related individuals without ASD. CYP2C19*2, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*41 were genotyped by the TaqMan method. Allelesâ and haplotype frequency differences in case and control groups were compared by chi square (Ï 2) test. Frequency of adverse reactions and  therapy corrections were evaluated in the patient group.Results: Association with ASD pharmacotherapy was not found for the ha  plotypes CYP2D6*41C/T â CYP2D6*4C/T (p,0.4), therefore these cannot be safely used in the drug therapy prognostics. In the case group CYP2D6*41 allele T was observed more frequently than in the control group (p,0.01).The most common adverse drug reaction was hyperprolactinemia, the cau se of which may be associated with ASD neurotransmitter defects, and not with the primary phase of xenobiotic metabolism.

Several lines of evidence have indicated the strong role of genetics in the etiology of ASDs. Progress in understanding the genetic and biological basis of autism has been impeded by the variability among individuals with autism. Clinical morpho logy might be used as a biomarker for ASDs to clarify the complexity of the disorder. In an effort to delineate more homogeneous autism subgroups for genetic study, we evaluated 83 autistic individuals. The clinical examination consi sted of standard morphological measurements and comprised a broad range of qualitative and quantitative physical measurements. Our findings show that morphological features are associated with autism and a comprehensi ve clinical morphology examination that classifies autistic children as either phenotypically normal or abnormal is the first step needed for separating autism into causally distinct subgroups. Exploring potential underlying ge netic mechanisms of this association might lead to a better understanding of autism. Identifiable endophenotypes and reliable biomarkers within ASDs would help to focus molecular research and uncover genetic causes and deve lopmental mechanisms.  D. Avdjieva Tzavella: None. S.

Genetic and cytogenetic studies revealed that most of the chromosomes are associated with autism, abnormalities of  chromosomes 15 and X being most frequently documented. AIM OF THE STUDY: Cytogenetic analysis on peripheral blood samples from children with autism was performed to identify possible structural or nume rical chromosomal abnormalities by GTG banding. RESULTS: The study revealed normal karyotypes in most cases (47 out of  50 individuals). Two of the male patients had modified karyotypes (2% mo saicism): chromosome 9qh+ polymorphism and terminal deletion on chro  mosome 15q, respectively. One of the female patients had an extra chromo  some 8 (2% mosaicism).CONCLUSION: This is the first cytogenetic testing performed specifically on  autistic children in Romania. Our results show that karyotyping analysis is not conclusive in most cases with autism. Nevertheless, the test should be proposed and performed for every autistic patient, in order to eliminate possible numerical or structural  chromosomal abnormalities as the cause for AD.  E.

Recent studies suggest that genes on chromosome 2 may be in volved in intelligence determination. Partial deletion or loss of genes from specific regions of chromosome 2 is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder, which may be associated with syn dromes. In this paper we report the case of a young girl, admitted in our hos   pital for severe retardation in motor acquisitions, at 1 year just active rol ling, with severe hypotonia, specific symptoms and signs related to autism, severe mental retardation, microcephaly and mild facial dysmorphism, who was found to have a rare genetic condition represented by a small deletion of the long arms of chromosome 2. We included her in a complex rehabilita   tion program from the age of fourteen months. The objective was obtaining age appropriate functional independence. At the first admission she had a severe hypotonic syndrome, severe retardation in the acquisition of motor skills and mental retardation. After 7 hospitalizations of 21 days each, du ring 2 years, with complex rehabilitation programs pool with thermal water and hydrokinetotherapy, individual kinetotherapy, electrotherapy, general massage, occupational therapy, the evolution was favorable with motor im provement. Independent standing, alternating steps, wider support base, ability to rise after falling and walking on short distances were achieved.Rehabilitation treatment is effective in improving motor skills and must be an early intervention.

This study describes the ap  plication of array CGH, as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of patients  with autism or ASD. Materials  Methods: During the last 4 years, 88/480 patients were studied with autism or ASD of unknown aetiology but with normal previous con ventional karyotype and other genetic tests. High resolution 4X180K and  1x244K Agilent arrays were used in the study (>170.000 and > 236.000 pro  bes respectively, average resolution of 8.9 Kb). Results: Submicroscopic genomic rearrangements (CNVs), ranging in size from 0.08 to19.01 Mb were detected in 51/88 (58%), some of which also presented: seizures (8/51), hypotonia (1/51), obesity (2/51), mental retar  dation (9/51), hearing loss (1/51) and dysmorphic features (2 / 51).

To test the strategy, we have evaluated the Russian co hort of children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and congeni tal anomalies (116 individuals; partially described in Iourov I.Y. et al.

79, Genomic View of Mosaicism and Disease,ES5.1,,"Mosaicism refers to the presence of two or more populations of cells with different genotypes within an organism, The timing of the events that lead to various mosaic genomic alterations can vary widely, leading to many diffe rent patterns of mosaicism. Mosaicism can result from abnormalities arising during meiosis, with correction during earliest development in some cells, or it may arise postzygotically, during early mitotic divisions. Mosaicism has been detected at surprisingly high frequency in the very early embryo, in miscarriages, in a wide variety of patients with clinical abnormalities and in normal individuals. In some cases, the clinical presentation might suggest mosaicism, as for example, in cases of ambiguous sex in an individual with XX/XY mosaicism, or in individuals with patchy pigmentation where lighter and darker skin may have different genotypes. However, in many cases mo saicism cannot be discerned at the clinical level. Mosaicism can be restricted to somatic tissues only, in which case it is unlikely to be inherited, or it can occur in both somatic and germline tissues, where transmission is possible, and in some cases it may be present in germ cells only, so that a normal individual is at risk for having multiple offspring with the mosaic finding. Mosaicism can be restricted to a single tissue, such as the brain or heart, causing tissue limited pathology, such as autism, schizophrenia or cardiac disease. In this session, we will trace the history of mosaicism from earliest examples of chromosomal mosaicism through recognition of mosaic DNA alterations and we will demonstrate how the utilization of SNP based chro mosomal microarray analysis and next generation sequencing have vastly improved our ability to detect mosaicism, leading to markedly increased recognition of the role of mosaicism in human disease. We will discuss the clinical and molecular classes of mosaicism, their detection and the biologi cal insights gained from these studies.",2014.0,,"N. B. Spinner , L. K.

To identify further Mendelian causes of intellectual disability (ID), we screened a cohort of 996 individuals with ID for variants in 565 known or  candidate genes using a targeted next generation sequencing approach.  Seven loss of function mutations (four nonsense variants  c.1195A>T , c.1333C>T , c.1866C>G, c.3001C>T and three frameshift variants  c.2175 76   delCA, c.3770insG, c.3856delT) were identified in SETD5, a gene predicted  to be a methyltransferase. All mutations were compatible with de novo do   minant inheritance. The affected individuals had moderate to severe ID with additional variable features of brachycephaly; prominent high forehead  with synophrys or striking eyebrows that are full and broad; a long, thin and  tubular nose; long narrow upslanting palpebral fissures and large fleshy low set ears. Skeletal anomalies were a frequent finding including significant leg  length discrepancy in two cases. Congenital heart defects, inguinal hernia  or hypospadias were all reported. Behavioural problems were a prominent feature including an obsessive compulsive disorder, hand flapping with  ritualised behaviour and autism. SETD5 lies within the critical interval for  the 3p25 microdeletion syndrome. The SETD5 mutation individuals have  phenotypic similarity to those previously reported with a deletion in 3p25  and thus loss of SETD5  may be sufficient to account for the clinical features  observed in this condition. Our findings add to the growing evidence that  mutations in methyltransferases that regulate histone modification are im  portant causes of ID.

We previously showed that increased dosage of methyl CpG binding prote  in 2 (MeCP2) leads to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder in males, desi   gnated as the MECP2 duplication syndrome (MIM#300260). The increased  dosage of MeCP2 is the result of a copy number gain at Xq28, including the MECP2 gene and results in severe to profound neurodevelopmental delay  with onset at birth, limited or absent speech, hypotonia, epilepsy, autistic  behavior and motor dysfunction. We developed induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome carrying different  duplication sizes, to study the impact of increased MePC2 dosage in human  neurons. Differentiation of these iPSCs into neurons of cortical identity sho   wed modulation in the expression of progenitor genes like BLBP and FOXG1  and cortical genes like RELN, CTIP2, TBR1  and VGLUT. Cortical neurons  derived from Mecp2dup iPSCs had more synapses, and altered network  synchronization as well as dendritic complexity.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is marked by extremely low body weight and in tense fear of gaining weight. We evaluated shared genetic determinants of AN and commonly comorbid psychiatric disorders (PsyD) by testing whe ther polygenic risk scores derived from genome wide data of other PsyD can predict AN status. We obtained allele risk scores for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), autism (AUT), attention deficit hy   peractivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). We divided each of these sets into 10 Pt signi ficance level thresholds. The test set comprised AN cases and controls from a published Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 AN GWAS study. For every test set sample, we produced a polygenic risk score as a weighted sum of risk allele scores. Logistic regression was used to assess whether each PsyD polygenic score predicted AN case control status. We computed pseu do R^2 values, and compared these to the values obtained when randomly permuting case control status to measure the proportion of variance in AN explained by each PsyD risk score. Our pseudo R^2 values were ~0.5 1%, comparable to pseudo R^2 values in a recent PGC polygenic score analysis of five PsyD. We computed an empirical p value for every significance thres   hold and found significant pseudo R^2 values at the lowest Pt threshold (Pt <0.001) for AN vs AUT (p,0.0009), MDD (p,0.009), and SCZ (0.0008), and at Pt <0.01 for BPD (p,0.0004).

192, Efficient molecular diagnosis of Intellectual Disability: targeted High throughput exon sequencing of 217 ID genes detects causative mutations in at least 26 of 106 tested patients,C18.2,,"Intellectual disability is a major public health problem, characterized by an extreme genetic heterogeneity, with several hundred genes implicated in monogenic forms with or without autism, complicating molecular dia gnosis. In patients without evocative syndromic forms the offer is limited to Fragile X testing and array CGH, leaving most cases undiagnosed. Trio Exome sequencing was recently proposed as a diagnostic approach, but re mains costly for general implementation. We thus tested targeted exon se   quencing of 217 genes previously implicated in X linked ID, or in autosomal dominant or recessive forms in which ID is the major clinical concern. We analyzed 106 patients (mostly males and sporadic cases) with molecularly undiagnosed ID. One third of them harbored autistic features.We identified causative mutations in 26 patients: sixteen in X linked ge nes (ATRX, CUL4B, DMD , FMR1, HCFC1, IL1RAPL1 , IQSEC2, KDM5C, MAOA,  MECP2, SLC9A6 , SLC16A2, PHF8), 10 de novo in autosomal genes (DYRK1A ,  GRIN1 , MED13L , TCF4, RAI1 , SHANK3, SLC2A1, SYNGAP1 ). We detected likely  causative mutations requiring additional validation in 5 patients (in NLGN3  for instance). Our findings confirm MED13L as an ID gene, but raise doubts on SHROOM4 or SRPX2. We identified causative mutations in syndromic ge  nes in patients deviating from the classic phenotype. Some genes were hit  more than once suggesting they correspond to more frequent conditions.  The identification of mutations in 25 29% of patients proves the diagnostic efficiency of this strategy, higher than CGH and comparable to trio exome sequencing at lesser cost.

Anophthalmia/microphthalmia (A/M) is a genetically heterogeneous birth defect for which the etiology remains unknown in more than 50% patients. A/M can occur without other structural eye defects (simplex A/M), or can be present with other ocular findings (complex A/M), such as anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD).

We report two additional cases of MPMCHD in a non con sanguineous Caucasian family: one patient presented at 6 months with ca taracts, mild developmental delays (DD) and hypotonia and at 16 months suffered severe episodes of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Despite inter   mittent periods of relative metabolic stability, the condition is progressing. At 13 years he is wheel chair bound, has failure to thrive (requiring tube feeding), global DD, autistic features, central hypotonia, and dystonia. Urine organic acid analyses reveal persistent 3 methylglutaconic aciduria. Muscle biopsy showed ragged red fibers and decreased staining for cytochrom C oxidase. Muscle analysis demonstrated reduced respiratory chain complex IV activity and increased mtDNA content in the absence of mutations or de   letions. This patientÃ¢ÂÂs sister has clinical presentation characterized by later onset and milder, but similar clinical course which includes congenital ca taracts, global DD and autistic features. Bouts of lethargy associated with lactic acidosis are frequent and require hospital admissions. Whole exome sequencing [done at Baylor College of Medicine] revealed two mutations in GFER gene: c.581G>A (p.R194H, previously reported) and c.215delG (p.A73Pfs*73).These cases further describe the phenotype associated with GFER gene mu tations.

FRAXE is an X linked form of intellectual disability characterized by mild  to moderate cognitive impairment, speech delay, hyperactivity, and autistic  behavior. The folate sensitive fragile site FRAXE is located in Xq28 appro  ximately 600 kb distal to the fragile X syndrome fragile site (FRAXA) and harbors an unstable GCC triplet repeat adjacent to a CpG island in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR  (untranslated region) of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene. The disorder results from  amplification and methylation of the GCC repeats and consequence silen cing of AFF2. Although chromosome abnormalities (mostly deletions) that disrupt AFF2 have been reported with mild moderate intellectual disability,  microduplication of Xq28 that partially involved AFF2 has not been descri   bed as a potential cause of FRAXE. We performed clinical and molecular cha  racterization of patient with 301 kb interstitial de novo duplication at Xq28 (chrX:147ÃÂ490ÃÂ437 147ÃÂ791ÃÂ737bp)(GRCh37/hg19). This genomic mutati   on leads to the duplication of part of 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR region of the AFF2 (FMR2) gene which could be inactivated due to this genomic change. Namely, duplication of this segment potentially could have the same effects as amplification and  methylation of an unstable GCC triplet repeats. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we are perfor   ming experiments aimed to study genic expression/metilation.

Copy number variants are frequent in autism spectrum disorders and gene ralized epilepsy. In this study, we performed comparative genomic hybridi   zation assay (aCGH) using Agilent Microarray Kit, 4x180K in a preselected sample of 36 Bulgarian patients with epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID). The region most often engaged in copy number changes included 15q11.2 15q12. In 7 patients (19.4%) CNVs were located in 15q12. Five of them har bored microduplications in GABRG3 gene, 1 patient showed microduplica tion in GABRB3 gene and in 1 patient both rearrangements were present. Aberrations in 15q11.2 region were observed in 2 patients. One of them was a 0.161 Mb deletion, including SNURF/SNRPN upstream reading frame. In the other patient, a 2.608 Mb duplication covering 36 genes was revealed. Genomic region on 15q11 13 is involved in many clinically important re arrangements. These include aberrations of various sizes which can affect the neuronal differentiation by disrupting normal epigenetic control and gene expression. All Bulgarian patients with CNVs harboring 15q12 shared a common clinical phenotype of severe ID, speech impairment or complete lack of speech, different types of seizures, facial dysmorphisms, microcepha ly and behavior abnormalities of the autistic spectrum. In contrast, the two patients with 15q11.2 rearrangements displayed different clinical characte ristics and milder forms of mental retardation. Our results are in line with the central role of GABAergic systems in ID and epilepsy. Further studies are needed to investigate the parental origin and elucidate the effect of the CNVs and the phenotype genotype correlations.

717, M The degree of Intellectual Disability is significantly associated with an excess of Runs of Homozygosity (ROH),P08.40,,"Several recent studies focused on the effect of extended homozygosity on highly complex and polygenic traits where recessive inheritance may play  an important role. Since excess of homozygosity might increase the risk for  disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease and autism, we have set out  a study to investigate the effect of ROHs on the degree of Intellectual Disa   bility (ID). About 370 unrelated individuals with ID were collected and clas sified into mild/moderate ID (MM ID) for IQ ranging from 35 40 to 70 75  and severe/profound ID (SP ID) for IQ below 35 40. High density SNP array  data were processed with the aim of detecting and analyze ROHs. Since dif   ferent array platform were used, homozygosity and ROHs mean length were  compared in MM ID vs SP ID separately in each dataset. Results were then combined for a meta analysis. Our data revealed an association between  the amount of homozygosity and the degree of ID, according to the recent  findings on autism (Gamsiz et al., 2013). Accounting for principal compo  nents to control population stratification, we tested for ROHs mean length and detected significantly (p<0.005) longer stretches in SP ID compared to MM ID. Weaker association was detected in burden ROH analysis, showing an increase of the percentage of genome covered by ROHs for SP ID cases. Extent of ROHs seems to contribute to the pathogenesis of ID, suggesting that autosomal recessive variants have a crucial role on the modulation of the severity of ID that still need to be investigated.",2014.0,,"I.

The majority of patients had whole genome array CGH prior to the selection and we did not include large rearrangements such as MECP2 and FMR1 duplications. We identified 4 rearrangements considered as causative or potentially pathogenic, corresponding to a detection rate of 8%.

Two new CNVs were considered as potentially pathogenic as they affected interesting can didates for ID. The first CNV is a deletion of the first exon of the TRPC5 gene, encoding a cation channel implicated in dendrite growth and patterning, in a child presenting with ID and an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The se   cond CNV is a partial deletion of KLHL15, in a patient suffering from severe ID, epilepsy and anomalies of cortical development.

Current evidence  suggests it is involved in neuronal development and maturation, and it has  recently been highlighted as potentially playing a key role in the evolution of the human brain. Clinically, NPAS3 has been identified as a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and numerous studies have supported this association. In addition, several cases of learning disabilities in patients with disruptions of this gene are reported, but this association remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present four unrelated individuals with small copy number vari ants (CNVs) within NPAS3: two intragenic duplications and two intragenic deletions. These CNVs range between 111 460kb in length and encompass  exonic sequences within the NPAS3 gene. All four patients had variable de   grees of developmental delay, and three had subtle distinctive facial features.  Two patients also had macrosomia and macrocephaly, while the other two had autistic features and behaviour issues, including psychosis in one indivi dual. In contrast, CNVs involving exonic sequences in NPAS3 have only been seen in one of over 19,000 controls. In summary, these four cases support an association between NPAS3 and developmental delay. This association is compatible with this geneÃ¢ÂÂs postulated effects on neuronal development, and suggests that abnormal function of NPAS3 may be implicated in other cases of non specific cognitive impairment.",2014.0,,"L.

However, some CNVs are unique and no comparison with similar genotypes (and phenotypes) is avai lable to assist in deciding about their causality.We identified a twelve year old stigmatized female patient with growth fai lure, microcephaly, severe psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, muscular atrophy, hip dislocation, foot deformity, vesicoureteral reflux and conge nital heart disease. Her karyotype was normal. SNP array analysis (Illumi   na HumanCytoSNP 12) revealed a unique 1.7 Mb long deletion in 9q21.3 (chr9:86,595,071 88,357,495; hg19) flanked by segmental duplications. FISH analysis of the family confirmed that the aberration was de novo. It removed 5 protein encoding RefSeq genes. The NTRK2 gene encodes a neu rotrophin receptor involved in the regulation of brain development, neuro transmission and synaptic function. Therefore NTRK2 is a good candidate gene for intellectual disability (ID). A missense NTRK2 mutation has been described in a boy with ID and obesity, and NTRK2 was considered also in autism and other psychiatric disorders. The mouse homologue of another deleted gene, AGTPBP1, is associated with neurodegeneration.Just one literature report exists describing a much more severely affected patient with a slightly larger deletion involving NTRK2. Remarkably, the deletion in our patient corresponds to an inversion described in several un affected individuals. The presence of the inversion and segmental duplicati   ons at the breakpoints could indicate a specific mechanism predisposing to rearrangements.

Clinical features include developmental regression at the age of 6 18 months, ac quired microcephaly, autistic behavior, loss or severe impairment of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, gait apraxia, and seizures. CDKL5 mutations have been identified in early onset seizure vari ant and FOXG1 mutations in congenital variant of Rett syndrome. We report the results of mutation analysis of these genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features. Materials and  methods: MECP2 was analyzed in 416 patients, CDKL5 was analyzed in 59 patients, and FOXG1 was analyzed in 20 patients. MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions and duplications were analyzed by MLPA analysis (MRC Holland). Results: Pathogenic mutations  in the MECP2 gene in were identified in 45 patients with classic Rett syn drome, 7 patients with atypical Rett syndrome, 11 patients with Rett like features, and 1 patient with autism. CDKL5 mutations were found in 2 pati   ents with early onset seizures and Rett like phenotype. No FOXG1 mutation was detected in this study. Conclusions:  MECP2 mutations are common in  classic Rett syndrome patients, but they are less frequent in atypical or Rett like phenotypes. However, analysis of MECP2 in these patients should not be discouraged. More patients should be examined to determine frequencies of CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations in Czech Republic.

Using 2 cohorts of AS and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing. Once we have hiPSCs we will proceed with neuronal differentiantion. With our experiments we confirm that the hiPSCs genesis is a stochastic process with a successful rate of 0.1 2% and that no standard protocol exists.

778, S Three SNP haplotypes in Neuroligins may correlate to autism susceptibility,P09.021,,"Chemistry  and Biology, University of Salerno, Fisciano (SA), Italy. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder showing a striking sex bias with  a male:female ratio of 4:1. Despite some genetic variants are causative for autism in about 17% of cases, its etiology is still largely unknown. Increa sing evidences highlight the possible role of environmental factors, such as infections, xenobiotics and drugs in enhancing autism genetic susceptibili ty. Among genetic variants, we focused on the X linked neuroligins that are involved in synaptic plasticity, are mutated in a few number of autistic pa tients, and are hemizygous in males. Hence we analyzed NLGN 3 and NLGN 4X in 52 Italian autistic cases (male:female,4,6:1) and in 31 healthy siblings (male:female,1:1,1) by Sanger sequencing. Among the other variants, in NLGN 4X, we found 2 de novo SNPs and 3 SNPs in non coding regions (1 intronic and 2 in the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR), giving 2 different haplotypes: one was new and one was already described in a non specific mental retardation Chinese pa tients. In NLGN 3, we found 3 already described intronic SNPs in haplotype block. The 3 haplotypes have statistical significance in autistics comparing to the minor allele frequencies (MAF) from the 1000 Genomes Project CEU. Interestingly, healthy siblings, half of which were female, have a middle sta tistical significance between autistics and MAF CEU. As these SNPs map to non coding regions, they could be involved in the genetic susceptibility to trigging environmental factors (probably lacking in siblings), and, being lo cated on X chromosome, could explain the male prevalence of autism.

We aim to evaluate family and patient specific charac teristics that may alter the clinical utility of autism risk variants. Material  and methods: The study contains 466 clinically well characterized patients with ASD from 392 families. Individuals were genotyped by either Affyme   trix SNP 6.0 array, OGT Oligo array or Illumina Omni2.5 8v1 SNP array. Ge notype data of each platform were preprocessed and normalized by limiting the resolution to 200 Kb and developing customized analysis protocols per platform to detect smaller variants in targeted regions. A filtering pipeline specific for ASD was developed using standard and customized Cartagenia ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2014 | MILAN, ITALY | WWW.ESHG.ORG 170Back to inde x Bench software applications. Results: We present a family based study on  the validity of CNV detection in ASD using microarray analysis. The clinical  utility of this screening is evaluated for different parameters (e.g. sporadic  versus familial ASD, IQ, comorbidity). In some cases, we found a better dia gnostic performance of the higher resolution platforms.

780, S Genetic evidence that hyperactive Th2 and NK immune pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder,P09.023,,"Converging evidence suggests that abnormal immunity is involved in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) both in children and  adults. Altered immune processes include ongoing neuroinflammation in  post mortem brains, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal  fluid and blood, altered immune cell function, presence of brain specific  auto antibodies, and dysregulated immune transcriptome. One strategy to  assess whether dysimmunity contributes to ASD pathogenesis or represents  a collateral by standing effect is to investigate whether functional SNPs  known to influence immune gene expression or function are associated with  ASD. We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro  band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in  all major immune pathways. Statistically significant opposite transmission  patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression  and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite  alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi  nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG)  activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autistic disorder in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014.0,,"I.

Proband diagnoses include: 52 autism, 9 cognitive disabilities, 4 developmental delay, 4 generalized dyspraxia, 3 learning disa   bilities and 9 other disorders. Patients were divided into 5 classes based on array CGH results: [1] certainly causal CNV, N,12 (15%); [2] probably causal CNV, N,23 (28%); [3] rare variant of uncertain interpretation, N,19 (23%); [4] common variant without causal role, N,20 (25%); [5] negative result, N,7 (9%). Array driven medical diagnostic work up was prescribed to 10 (12,3%) patients and 3 parents, while drug therapies or supplements were prescribed to 4 (7,5%) patients. The diagnostic work up was positive in 3 patients and 1 parent, while therapies were ineffective in 1 case and still pending evaluation in the other three. Array CGH is thus a powerful clinical tool, provided its focus includes the functional role of duplicated or dele ted genes, their presence in neurodevelopmental disorder databases and possible imprinting.

The pathogenicity of the reciprocal microduplications is more uncertain.Even if the recurrent deletion contains several genes, CHRNA7, encoding for the alpha7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, is consi   dered the culprit gene in mediating the neurological phenotypes in patients with the 15q13.3 deletion.In order to evaluate the role of CHRNA7 rare variants in ASD susceptibility, we have performed copy number variant (CNV) analysis and mutation scree ning of the coding sequence of CHRNA7 in a sample of 135 ASD individuals from Italy. Rare sequence variation in this gene remains largely unexplored, given the existence of a fusion gene, CHRFAM7A, which includes a partial duplication of exons 5 10 of CHRNA7. Hence, any attempts at sequencing to detect mutations must distinguish between CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A, ma king next generation sequencing approaches unreliable for this purpose.CNV analysis led to the identification of a CHRNA7 microduplication in a subject with autism and moderate cognitive impaiment. No pathogenic mutations were identified in CHRNA7 coding regions. However, we detec ted rare variants in the proximal promoter region, previously described to functionally reduce transcription. In conclusion, rare sequence variants in CHRNA7 do not significantly contribute to ASD susceptibility, at least in our clinical sample characterized by low frequency of associated medical comorbidity.

In this study, we observed MEF2C haploinsufficiency in 1,5% (95% confidence interval: 0 3.2%) of patients with ASD. This is the first study to look specifically at MEF2C in ASD. Of note, a mutation in MEF2C was also found once by whole exome sequencing in another cohort of 175 trios with ASD.

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autistic spectrum. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndromes in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval.Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan   ces.

Mutations in the NR2A and NR2B subunits encoded by the genes GRIN2A  and GRIN2B  have  been associated with different phenotypes of intellectual disability (ID). Mutations in GRIN2A  were known to cause unspecific ID and epilepsy as  well as other neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas mutations in GRIN2B have mainly been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but not seizures. We show for the first time that mutations of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor cause different and specific epilepsy phenotypes. NR2 muta   tions are involved in benign Rolandic epilepsy, the most frequent childhood epilepsy as well as in a variety of rare infantile epileptic encephalopathi es, such as Landau Kleffner and West syndrome. Furthermore, we demon   strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign  Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre  sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations. The severity of phenotypes depends on the af fected domain and the extent of receptor activation.

We describe an approach involving careful phenotyping of each proband and employ a trio design to exome sequence characterise causative mutations. This study will encompass both non syndromic and syndromic cases of PH and seek to map candidate causative variants into gene interaction networks. Similar approaches have proved successful for other neurological disorders such as autism. Illustrating the legitimacy of our approach we describe an identified de novo mutation in a gene encoding a calmodulin isoform. The mutation re sides in one of four highly conserved calcium binding pockets of this protein where it is predicted to alter function. Substantial evidence demonstrates direct binding between calmodulin and filaminA.

Cytogenetic analysis has demonstrated a mosaic deletion of chromosome 21: 46,XX,?mos del(21) (q21q21)[5]/ 46,XX[15]. Molecular cytogenetic analysis using oligonu  cleotide array CGH has confirmed the presence of mosaic deletion spanning  21q11.1q21.2 chromosome region (11.423 Mb). Additionally, a non mosaic deletion at 4p16.3 (size: 3.712 Mb) affecting 83 genes, 40 of which are listed in OMIM was found. Mosaic 21q11.1q21.2 was also confirmed using multi   color chromosome banding (MCB), which has shown this deletion to affect 19% of cells.

KAT6B is highly conserved and expressed in adult neural stem cells. Most mutations are in exon 18 encoding the acidic (A) and tran scriptional activation (TA) domains of KAT6B. Genotype phenotype correla   tion showed that patients with mutations in the 5ÃÂ´ region of exon 18 leading to loss of both domains suffer from GPS, while patients with mutations in the 3ÃÂ´ region leading to loss of the TA domain suffer from SBBYSS.We present an 8 year old girl with intellectual disability, autism and multip   le developmental anomalies.

In addition to the already described ma crocephaly and mild ID, they share osteo articular defects, patella dislocati on, behavioral abnormalities, psychosis, learning difficulties, celiac disease, prognathism, myopia and astigmatism. Consistent with a loss of function of TBC1D7 the probandÃ¢ÂÂs cell lines show an increase in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, a direct downstream target of mTORC1 and a delay in the initiation of the autophagy process.This second family allows enlarging the phenotypic spectrum associated with TBC1D7 mutations and defining a TBC1D7 syndrome.

The platform of choice to  detect genome wide CNVs has traditionally been microarray (including SNP  arrays that can also detect copy neutral LOH regions); however, since samp  les have often undergone sequencing to discover pathogenic sequence vari  ants, it is desirable to exploit these data to also detect CNVs. Various methods  have been proposed to detect CNVs from NGS data, but little information is  available which compare the success of these approaches to orthogonal me  thods. Using a large data set of constitutional samples from an autism cohort  that have been subjected to both whole exome sequencing (WES) and to a  genome wide SNP microarray, we compare the ability to detect CNVs bet   ween these platforms.

The temporal coordination of biological processes into daily cycles is a com mon feature of most living organisms. Day/night cycles represent a major  circadian synchronizing signal and vary widely with latitude. In humans dis   ruption of circadian rhythms is a common feature in psychiatric diseases in  cluding schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and autism. We applied  an approach that analyses spatial correlations between genetic variation  and environmental factors. We exploited genotype data from 52 human po pulations distributed worldwide and determined the annual maximal varia tion in day length (ÃÂphotoperiod), this latter used as a measure of selective  pressure. With this approach we analyzed 5 independent sets of genes invol  ved in circadian regulation or in sleep homeostasis. For all sets a significant enrichment of variants showing signals of photoperiod driven selection  was detected. Analysis of population genetic differentiation (FST) confir   med strong spatial signatures of natural selection at photoperiod selected  variants. Also, tests based on haplotype homozygosity indicated that a si  gnificantly high proportion of photoperiod selected SNPs underwent selec  tive sweeps in non African populations. Finally, using variants identified in genome wide association studies we determine that a significantly high proportion of risk SNPs for schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder correla   tes with ÃÂphotoperiod. Notably, many risk variants showing signals of pho toperiod driven selection map to genes with strong evidence of involvement in circadian rhythm regulation. Thus, human populations adapted to life at different latitudes by tuning their circadian clock systems. This process also involved risk variants for neuropsychiatric conditions. Data herein suggest possible genetic modulators for chronotherapies and candidates for interac tion analysis with photoperiod related environmental variables.",2014.0,,"D. Forni1, U. Pozzoli1, R.

The array Comparative Genomic Hybridization technology (aCGH) is inten sively used in research and clinical diagnosis for the detection and identi  fication of genome rearrangements in patients with different physical/intel  lectual development anomalies. The aim of our study was to apply the aCGH technology in evaluation with high resolution of the entire genome in pediatric patients with developmen tal delay (DD), intellectual disabilities (ID) and dysmorphic features (DF) for  identifying the genetic causes responsible for the clinical observation. Twenty patients with DD, ID and DF from Romania, aged between 4 months and 14 years, were included in high resolution aCGH analysis with Nimble Gen ISCA Plus 3x1.4M Platform (Roche). All patients were previously as sessed by conventional cytogenetic analysis.The aCGH analysis detected clinically relevant chromosomal abnormalities in seven of the patients analyzed, as follows:  micro deletions ranging between 2.5 Kb 6 Mb, associated with Pitt Hop kins syndrome (18q21.2), obesity, ID/DF (6q16.1 q16.2 q16.3), DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2);  micro duplications ranging between 12.5 Kb 1.9 Mb, associated with ID (17q23.2), the Potocki Lupski rare syndrome (17p12 11.2) and autism (Xp22.11);  a 30 MB duplication (8q13.3 q22.3), leading to the identification and exact characterisation of a marker chromosome indicated by conventional cyto genetic analysis.Genomic anomalies identified and characterized by aCGH provided accurate diagnosis of unidentified or unexplained diseases suspected to have a gene tic cause, contributing to appropriate clinical management of the affected patients.Our study demonstrated that aCGH technology can play a very important role in identification and characterization of cryptic and/or complex chro mosomal rearrangements, being a valuable tool in postnatal diagnosis.",2014.0,,"G.

Reci procal 16p13.1 rearrangements predispose to developmental delay. Besides, 16p11.2 rearrangements have been identified in up to 1% of autistic indivi duals. These deletions have also been associated with obesity. A ~550 kb deletion is commonly reported; and a smaller deletion of an adjacent region on 16p11.2 has also been found in patients with overlapping clinical fea tures. The phenotypic spectrum of rearrangements in this genomic region remains to be fully characterized. Methods: We describe two new unrelated  cases with 16p11.2 microdeletions diagnosed by whole genome oligonu cleotide array CGH. We also compare the phenotype of our patients with other cases described in the literature. Results: One patient, referred to our  clinic with moderate developmental delay, significant behavioral problems and unspecific dysmorphisms, has the Ã¢ÂÂtypicalÃ¢ÂÂ ~550 kb deletion. There is a known family history of learning disabilities. However it was not possible to test his relatives because he was placed in institutional care.

As early lethality is common in geneti cally engineered mice, an important proportion of homozygous mutant mice cannot be phenotyped. When the corresponding heterozygous mice have no phenotype, the effects of this mutation remain unknown. Unfortunately, stu dies in newborn mice face major difficulties due to the small size of the pups and their sensory and motor immaturity. In order to gain access to the early post natal phenotype, we developed three dedicated non invasive devices, suitable for high throughput screening:   PhysioPups (patented device) is used to assess vital functions: breathing patterns, electrocardiogram (ECG),  body temperature, gross body mov ements, and ultrasonic vocalizations.  Four animals can be tested simultaneously under controlled conditions of temperature and gas composition.   NeoGAIT is used to assess gait ontoge ny. It uses infrared detection of the animalÃ¢ÂÂs contact patterns with the floor and custom image analysis software.   MemoryPups is used to assess me mory and associative learning abilities. The tests are based on olfaction and thermotactile sensitivity, the only sensory functions operating at birth. This platform has no equivalent worldwide. It allows phenotyping mice pups from the first few hours after birth until weaning. It is currently used to cha racterize genetically engineered mice, including models of genetic diseases (autism, Prader Willi, OndineÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome) and to study the toxicity of anti infectious drugs used in neonates (eg.

2329," Epigenetics, maternal responsibility and neurological development",J16.12,,"It is believed that epigenetics can partly explain the development of neuro logical conditions. As epigenetic changes often happen in utero, maternal  behavior may affect brain development. This raises questions regarding the  responsibility of the pregnant woman. To which extent is she responsible for  the neurological status of the future child? Should she, for example, avoid all stress, if this is shown to lead to molecular changes increasing the chance of the child to develop ADHD later in life? Should she ensure that she takes op  timum nutrition for development of synaptic plasticity of her fetus? With of  this talk I demonstrate first that epigenetics complicates the question of the  responsibility of the pregnant woman. To which extent does the increasing knowledge about epigenetics influences in utero further complicate this re sponsibility, if even behavior of years before the conception may influence a  fetus? Is this an individual responsibility or also a collective one? Second, by  using the examples of autism and extreme intelligence, I demonstrate that ,  although discussions about parental responsibility towards future children have centered on duties to prevent suffering or to maximize welfare or Ã¢ÂÂthe chance of a good lifeÃ¢ÂÂ, the distinction between prevention and enhancement is difficult to maintain in the context of neurological conditions. By analy   zing arguments from the neurodiversity movement, whose members often insist that their neurological condition is not a disease, but an integral part of their identity, I shall demonstrate that there is a need for a revisiting of the concept of maternal responsibility.",2014.0,,K.

We follow up fin dings and draw comparisons with additional large ASD and control data   sets: the Simons Simplex and the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) collections (2,670 affected individuals; 9681 total individuals). Comparing across these cohorts, we demonstrate that ascertainment can lead to selec tion of different underlying genetic mechanisms causing ASDs. These diffe rences are reflected in metrics such as the affected male:female ratio and the relative contribution of de novo CNVs versus inherited homozygous de   letions. Specifically, we find that de novo CNVs play a significant role in non consanguineous families with a single affected child (p,0.04), but a lesser role in multiplex families, and they are no more common in ASD cases than  controls in multiplex consanguineous families. In contrast, we present the  strongest statistical evidence (p,0.013) to date that homozygous deletions, are a major contributor to ASD disease burden in consanguineous families,  contributing to as much as 5 10% of cases.",2014.0,,"K.

56, Selfish mosaicism: impact of somatic mutations occurring in the paternal germline,S15.2,,"As mutations are at the origin of all genetic variations, understanding the factors that influence the apparent rate at which de novo mutations occur is crucial to the study of genome diversity, evolution and diseases. Although it is well established that point mutations initially arise as random miscopying events, preferentially from the paternal germline, we have described a new mechanism which predicts that certain pathogenic mutations may hijack the way sperm production is controlled to their own advantage. In doing so, these Ã¢ÂÂselfishÃ¢ÂÂ mutations become progressively enriched in the testis as men age and are therefore associated with an increased risk of transmission to the next generation.The concept of selfish spermatogonial selection was originally proposed to account for the unusual presentation of a group of rare Mendelian diseases, which we collectively called Ã¢ÂÂpaternal age effect disordersÃ¢ÂÂ. It relies on prin ciples similar to oncogenesis to explain why some paternally derived muta   tions, such as those causing Apert (FGFR2) and Costello (HRAS) syndromes or achondroplasia (FGFR3), occur spontaneously at levels up to 1000 fold higher than the genomic background rate. The evidence   gathered original  ly through direct quantification of these ultra rare pathogenic mutations in  human sperm   suggests that selfish mutations, although occurring rarely, confer a selective advantage to mutant spermatogonial stem cells, leading to  their clonal expansion and progressive enrichment in sperm over time. Our understanding of this process so far suggests that molecularly selfish selection relies on the activation of the growth factor receptor RAS signal   ling pathway, which is a key regulator of stem cell homeostasis in the testis. As RAS is required in many different cellular contexts, we will discuss to which extend dysregulation of this pathway is likely to be relevant to the  pathology of common disorders, including cancer predisposition and neu  rodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism   for which paternal age effects have been described epidemiologically.",2015.0,,A.

Mutations in chromatin remodelling and histone modification genes are increasingly recognized as a major cause of intellectual disability (ID) and other frequently overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. BCL11A has recently been shown to be a stable subunit of the BAF SWI/SNF complex in mammals. This evolutionary conserved complex is involved in transcriptional regulation through ATP dependent modification of chroma tin structure.The Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study (DDD) has identified de novo mutations in BCL11A  (previously linked to autism spectrum disorder)  as a cause of non syndromic intellectual disability. We present the clinical features of these patients, as well as model organism studies that support the role of Bcl11a in neurodevelopmental phenotypes.In mouse embryonic development, Bcl11a is expressed in the forebrain  and derivatives of the first and second pharyngeal arches. It maintains high expression in the central nervous system and craniofacial mesenchyme throughout postnatal stages. The study of the haploinsufficient mouse mo del of Bcl11a shows abnormal brain development, with overall decreased  brain size, particularly in regions of the limbic system. Behavioural pheno typing has identified impaired social behaviour in the haploinsufficient mice compared to littermate controls.Previously known for its role in lymphoid malignancies, BCL11A  now joins  the increasing number of genes involved in neurodevelopment through a putative role in chromatin remodelling.",2015.0,,"C.

134, Whole genome sequencing reveals the mutation characteristics in Autism Spectrum Disorder,C10.1,,"JohnÃ¢ÂÂs, NL, Canada. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is genetically heterogeneous, with evi  dence for hundreds of susceptibility loci. Previous microarray and exome  sequencing studies have examined portions of the genome in simplex fami  lies (parents and one ASD affected child) having presumed sporadic forms of the disorder. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 85 quartet  families (parents and two ASD affected siblings), consisting of 170 indivi  duals with ASD, to generate a comprehensive data resource encompassing all classes of genetic variation (including noncoding variants) and accom panying phenotypes, in apparently familial forms of ASD. By examining de  novo and rare inherited single nucleotide and structural variations in genes  previously reported to be associated with ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders, we found that more than two thirds of the affected siblings car  ried different ASD relevant mutations. These siblings with discordant muta   tions tended to demonstrate more clinical variability than those who shared  a risk variant. Our study emphasizes that substantial genetic heterogeneity exists in ASD, necessitating the use of WGS to delineate all genic and non genic susceptibility variants in research and in clinical diagnostics. We have now sequenced 200 additional ASD families using WGS. We will present our complete data analysis as well as additional progress from this study.",2015.0,,"R. K. Yuen1, B.

135, Identification of a common set of microRNAs deregulated in Autism Spectrum disorders,C10.2,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease caused by an interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post transcriptional regulators and are involved in multiple aspects of brain development and connectivity. Here, using olfactory mucosal stem cells biopsied from living patients, we identified a signature of four miRNAs (miR 146a, miR 221, miR 654 5p and miR 656) commonly deregulated in ASD. This signature is conserved in pri mary skin fibroblasts and allows discriminating between ASD and intellec tual disability samples. Putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for pathways previously associated to ASD and alte red levels of neuronal transcripts targeted by miR 146a, miR 221 and miR 656 were observed in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ cells. In the mouse brain, miR 146a displays strong neuronal expression in regions important for high cognitive func tions, and we demonstrate that overexpressing miR 146a leads to alteration of neuronal dendritic arborisation.

155, Human specific gene evolution and diversity of the chromosome 16p11.2 autism CNV,C13.1,,"Recurrent 600kbp deletions and duplications at 16p11.2 are associated with autism, schizophrenia and extremes of BMI and head circumference. These  rearrangements occur via non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR)  between BOLA2 containing directly oriented segmental duplications at BP4  (breakpoint 4) and BP5. Illumina sequencing of 2,551 humans, 86 great apes, a Neanderthal and a Denisovan showed that modern humans carry at least one additional copy of BOLA2 (from 3 to 10 diploid copies) in contrast  to apes and archaic hominins. Through Illumina and PacBio sequencing of large insert clones from orangutan and chimpanzee, we identified three in versions in the human lineage after divergence from orangutan, affecting >1Mbp of sequence and 45 genes, together with the addition of ~1Mbp via  segmental duplication. The latter includes a ~102kbp BOLA2 segment that  duplicated ~183kya, the time when Homo sapiens  emerged as a species. We sequenced four human haplotypes and discovered multiple ~102kbp  tandem duplications in BP4 and BP5, likely leading to different NAHR pre disposition. We are currently assaying BOLA2 copy number and refining  breakpoints in >125 patients with a BP4 BP5 deletion or duplication. BO  LA2 is ubiquitously expressed, present in all eukaryotes, and involved in the  regulation of iron metabolism. Expression levels in human lymphoblastoids correlate with copy number (r,0.29), expression of genes on 16p13 and 19p13, and of genes encoding mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins.These findings suggest that a possible advantage linked to the emergence of duplicated genes in the last 200,000 years of human evolution, underlies the predisposition to recurrent rearrangements at 16p11.2 associated with autism.",2015.0,,"G.

156," Chromosomal contacts connect loci associated with autism, BMI and head circumference phenotypes",C13.3,,"We identified the cis  and trans acting long range chromosomal contacts of five genes located within the 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 copy number variants (CNVs). Its deletion is one of the most frequent known etiologies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), while this deletion and reciprocal duplication are associated with mirror phenotypes on BMI, head circumference and brain volume. We observed complex chromatin looping between genes located in the proximal 600kb BP4 BP5 and those mapping to the distal 16p11.2 220kb BP2 BP3 region, two loci separated by 650kb, successfully confir   med by reciprocal 4C, FISH, Hi C and associations between active regula   tory regions. Phenotyping of 137 unrelated carriers of distal 16p11.2 220 kb BP2 BP3 deletion and duplication showed that these CNVs are similarly associated with ASD and reciprocal impacts on BMI and HC.Our results indicate that chromosomal contactsÃ¢ÂÂ maps could uncover func tionally and clinically related genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, loci chromatin contacted by our selected viewpoints are enriched for ASD genes (OR,2.15, P,1.65e 08). Furthermore, we uncovered 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 chromatin loops with (i) the 1q21.1 cytoband, whose deletions and du plications were previously linked to micro  and macrocephaly, respectively; (ii) PTEN, mutations of which are associated with a macrocephalic form of ASD; and (iii) the 2p15 cytoband. We enrolled 35 carriers of 2p15 16.1 de   letion and duplication and showed that they similarly display mirror pheno types on HC and weight.Finally, we observe that genes differentially expressed in 16p11.2 BP4 BP5 CNV carriers are concomitantly modified in their chromatin interactions, suggesting that disruption of chromatin interplays participates in the ob   served phenotypes.

204, ST AG1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for a new cohesinopathy with intellectual disability and characteristic facial features in four unrelated individuals,C21.2,,"Cohesinopathies are rare disorders arising from a dysfunction in the cohesin  pathway, which enables chromosome segregation and proper cell division.  So far, seven genes from this pathway have been reported in human disease.  Five of them are involved in autosomal dominant (NIPBL, SMC3, RAD21) or X linked (SMC1A and HDAC8) Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and two of them  in autosomal recessive Roberts (ESCO2) and Warsaw Breakage syndromes  (DDX11). All are severe neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, limb defects and facial dysmorphism. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin complex, which,  along with three other subunits, mediates cohesion between sister chroma tids. Here, we report an international series of four unrelated individuals, 3  males and 1 female, aged 8 to 33 years, referred for moderate to severe intel  lectual disability that could be attributed to STAG1 haploinsufficiency. Three had history of intrauterine growth retardation, two with prenatal onset  microcephaly, one with post natal growth retardation. One individual had  epilepsy, two had autistic features. The four patients shared common facial features, with widely spaced incisors, thin eyebrows, and high nasal bridge. The mechanism for haploinsufficiency was a small deletion encompassing  STAG1 diagnosed by array CGH in two individuals, an intragenic deletion in  STAG1 found by whole genome analysis in one individual, and a missense heterozygous mutation (c.641A>G) revealed by exome analysis in the last patient.

507, High yield of copy number variations in individuals with complex congenital heart disease in Saudi Arabs,PS05.27,,"Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. IntroductionCongenital heart diseases (CHDs) are complex cardiac disorders that mani fest in different forms, such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), ventricular septal defects (VSDs), atrial septal defects (ASDs), coarctation, and may occur in combination with other defects. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in many complex disorders, including cardiovascular and cancer. However, the impact of such variants on congenital heart disease (CHD) ma nifestation is not fully explained yet.MethodsIn the present study, we selected and performed Copy Number Analysis on 50 Saudi (Arab) cases of complex CHDs, including TOFs, bicuspid aortic val  ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.ESHG.ORG 117Back to inde x ve (BCV), tricuspid atresia (TCA) and subaortic membrane (SAM) disorders,  to determine the possible link of the disease to changes in copy numbers. Results Among the 50 individuals, 22 exhibited CNVs on four chromosomal regi ons. Out of these were 16 TOFs exhibiting duplications, three of which were  linked to chromosome 17q21.31, two to 16p11.2, and one each to 2q13,,  19p13.3 and 20p12.3. Furthermore, one TOF together with three complex cases involving BAV, and SAM, KartagenerÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome, exhibited deletions at 16p11.2 and 15q11.2. Interestingly, an individual case with TCA showed  copy number gain at 2q13, while another with Kartagener syndrome sho   wed a copy number loss at the same locus. These duplications/deletions  involved sequences of 420 1200 kbp. The qPCR verification assays on five  of the studied individuals confirmed the duplications and deletions found  by cytoscanning.Conclusion Our study reveals a high yield of CNVs in CHD, mostly in the regions of chro  mosomes 16p11.2 and 17q21.31, which could be used clinically to identify such patients routinely.",2015.0,,"N.

558, Extending the phenotypic spectrum of RYR2 mutations: mind the brain!,PS05.75,,"Introduction:  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia  (CPVT) is a rare inherited cardiac disorder characterized by adrenergically mediated ventricular arrhythmias. The most common autosomal dominant form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR2) gene. Apart from the myocardium, this calcium release channel is highly expressed in the brain. Here we studied the prevalence and characte ristics of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with CPVT . Methods: We included all CPVT patients with a pathogenic RYR2 mutation  and intellectual disability (ID) from 4 tertiary referral centers in the Nether   lands and Japan. ID was defined as significant impairment of cognitive and  adaptive functions with onset before the age of 18. Results: Among 250 CPVT patients carrying a RYR2 mutation, we identi  fied 18 patients with ID (7.2% compared to 1% of the general population).  The RYR2 mutations (15 missense and 1 splice site) clustered in the known  hot spot regions. Two mutations have been previously described in patients  without reported ID. In 9 out of 14 patients studied (64%) the mutation ap  peared de novo. The severity of ID ranged from mild to severe, and was often  accompanied by behavioral disorders including autism and attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder. Of note, the majority of patients displayed marked supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, with a high incidence (39%)  of serious arrhythmic events during follow up including 3 fatal events. Conclusions: ID is more prevalent among RYR2  positive CPVT patients than  in the general population, and is associated with a malignant cardiac phe  notype.

573, A very common inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis about which little is known,PS06.05,,"Introduction: TMLHE deficiency is a very common inborn error of carnitine  biosynthesis. The gene is X linked, and about 1 in 350 healthy males of Eu ropean descent have a deletion of exon 2 resulting in inability to synthesize carnitine. TMLHE deficiency likely is a risk factor for autism, but the pene  trance for autism is less than 5%, and replication studies are needed.Materials and Methods: The frequency of exon 2 deletion was determined in 10,678 male samples undergoing array CGH for evaluation of heteroge neous disabilities and in 2124 male samples from the Baylor Mendelian Ge nome Center exome project. A case evaluation was performed on a TMLHE  deficient male with autism and two episodes of regression.Results: Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE was found in 50 of 10,678 males  undergoing array CGH (0.46%) compared to 7 in 2245 males undergoing exome sequencing in the Mendelian studies (0.31%). The phenotypic data for the deficient males are being tabulated. Carnitine deficiency in a TMLHE  case suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with autism.Conclusions: Deletion of exon 2 is confirmed to be very common in various clinical samples. A case study suggests that carnitine supplementation may be useful in treating regressive autism episodes in patients with TMLHE  deficiency. It is unknown if infant males with TMLHE deficiency should re  ceive any dietary modification. It is unknown if there are genetic, dietary, or microbiome factors that influence the development of autism in TMLHE  deficient males.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW.ESHG.ORG 131Back to inde x",2015.0,,"A.

To date, less than ten cases was described so far in the literature. This chromosomal syndrome manifests in developmental delay/intellectual impairment, postnatal over   growth, macrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphy, slender habitus, advanced bone age, and scoliosis. Hypotonia, unusual behavior with autistic traits, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and hand/foot abnormalities are also fre quent. Very similar phenotype is observed in the Sotos syndrome 2 (MIM #614753) that is caused by heterozygous mutations/deletions of the NFIX gene located on chromosome 19p13.2.Here, we report on the case of a 7 year old girl referred to genetic counse   ling because of psychomotor retardation, speech delay and dysmorphic fea tures (macrocephaly, long/narrow and triangular face, high forehead, fron tal bossing, downslanting palpebral fissures, dysplastic low set ears, small nose, flat philtrum, micrognathia). At the examination, behavioral problems (anxiety, tantrums, autoaggression), seizures, and poor coordination were noted. Skeletal anomalies (advanced bone age, joint laxity, slender hands with long fingers, abnormal setting of the lower limbs), strabismus, hypero pia as well as constipations and abdominal pain were also diagnosed.Whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a de novo 158.18 kb (the smallest so far) deletion of 19p13.2 region (chr19:13,020,206 13,178,390; hg19) encompassing seven genes; three of them (NFIX, DAND5 and CALR) could be the candidate genes for the genotype phenotype rela   tionship.This study contributes additional information for the newly identified 19p13.2 microdeletion syndrome and clarifies the clinical roles of genes in the involved region.

690," 2p25 deletion: involvement of SNTG2 in autism or behavioral troubles, and parental imprinting.",PS08.05,,"Deletions of the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 2 have  been reported in the literature in less than 20 patients. These patients share common clinical features including early onset obesity, intellectual disabili ty and behavioral troubles or autism. A minimal critical region of 1.97 Mb has been estimated, encompassing seven genes (SH3HYL1 , ACP1, TMEM18 ,  SNTG2, TPO, PXDN, and MYT1L). Many recent studies pointed out MYT1L  gene as the main candidate for ID and obesity. We present three new pa tients carrying 2p25 deletions: an autist female child with developmental delay and her depressive father, and a third unrelated patient who has psy   chomotor retardation and behavioral troubles. Moreover, our patients do not have an overweight phenotype, highlighting indeed the role of MYT1L  in obesity, as none of the deletions encompasses MYT1L. The only common  disrupted gene is SNTG2, thus redefining the smallest region of overlap for  autism. SNTG2 is expressed in brain. Its product interacts with neuroligins  NLGN3, NLGN4X, and NLGN4Y, which are autism related isoforms. Finally, the parental origin of the deletions seems to be of interest, as all inherited deletions described today appear to be inherited from the paternal side.

A submicroscopic duplication in the Xp22.31 region was identified in 8 patients (5Ã¢ÂÂ:3Ã¢ÂÂ) ranging in size from 257 Kb to 1.7 Mb. In all individuals studied (four out of eight) the Xp22.31 duplication was inherited from the mother. The HDHD1, STS, VCX and PNPLA4 genes are included in four cases with a 1.6Mb duplication, who show autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and no dysmorphic features. Interestingly, two cases with a size below 580Kb, where only HDHD1 and STS genes are duplicated, show a more severe phenotype with multiple malformations. The largest duplica   tion detected (from VCX3A to VCX2) is associated with language delay. The patient also carries a deletion at 6p23 of 1.3 Mb as a result of an unbalanced t(6;9). Finally, a duplication of 565Kb involving VCX and PNPLA4 was detec ted in a boy with psychomotor delay.Conclusion:We have detected an association of the Xp22.31 duplication with ID and ASD in both genders. According to the literature, there is a high variability in the Xp22.31 duplication associated phenotype, which may be due to incomplete penetrance, the different genes involved, a position effect and X inactivation.

METHODSWe performed exome sequencing using the Ion AmpliSeq TM Exome technolo   gy (Life Technologies) with Ion ProtonTM. Sequencing reads were analysed using Torrent Suite software. Trio annotated variants using ION Reporter were prioritized with an in house analytical pipeline to identify causative genetic variants.RESULTSWe present data on the first 50 probands for whom referring physicians or   dered whole exome sequencing trio analysis. Patients were mainly children with neurologic disorders including developmental and/or speech delay, autism, and intellectual disability. We identified 5 pathogenic and 14 pro bably pathogenic mutated alleles that were highly likely to be causative in 18 of the 50 patients, achieving a 36% molecular diagnostic rate. Among the 18 patients, 1 had X linked dominant, 2 X linked recessive, 1 autosomal recessive, and 14 autosomal dominant diseases. The X linked dominant va riant and all of the autosomal dominant mutant alleles occurred Ã¢ÂÂde novoÃ¢ÂÂ .  Additionally, variants of uncertain significance were identified in 21 pati   ents.

708, A novel HCN1 mutation not associated with epileptic encephalopathy,PS08.23,,"B. Rossi Hospital, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. The hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide gated channel (HCN1 4) family has important roles in the control of heart rate and neuronal excita  bility. HCN channels selectively conduct K+/Na+ inward current after hy   perpolarized potential. In neurons, HCN channels participate in a variety  of functions among which excitabily, dendritic integration and plasticity.  Animal models have indicated that dysregulation of these channels is as  sociated with several forms of epilepsy including febrile seizures, absence and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as other neurological disorders. Recently HCN1 point mutations have been found in individuals with early onset epi  leptic encephalopathy with features resembling Dravet syndrome but with  different progression over time. All of them developed intellectual disability and autistic traits. Here we report the case of a 9 year old girl with a Rett like phenotype, cha  racterized by intellectual disability, hand stereotypies, absent speech, nega tive brain MRI and EEG data and no history of epilepsy. By NGS approach,  with the use of a targeted intellectual disability/epilepsy gene panel, we  found the girl to carry a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the HCN1 gene. This mutation is located in the glycine tyrosine glycine (GYG) motif, which constitutes the ion selectivity filter typical of K+  permeable channels.

It can be divided into a proximal region containing  16 genes and a distal region containing 13 genes. Array Comparative Ge nomic Hybridization (array CGH) has led to the identification of new syn  dromes including microdeletion 1q21.1 and 1q21.1 microduplication. Cli  nical features of patients include intellectual disability (ID) and dysmorphic features.

Intellectual disability (ID) has an incidence of 2% and overlaps with autism. It is characterized by a striking genetic heterogeneity that underlies a phe notypic heterogeneity in severity and in associated medical problems. Pro gress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and of more than 400 genes implicated in monogenic forms of ID/autism. An increasing number of genetic diagnoses are made in individuals with ID/autism but the genetic heterogeneity renders extremely difficult the determination of genotype phenotype correlations and natural history. Symptomatic treatments for comorbidities are proposed with limited op portunities to assess their efficacies or potential adverse effects.We have initiated the development of an alternative database model for specific genetic causes of ID/autism, organized in a social network format whereby most clinical information is entered by the family of the patient based on wide range questionnaires translated in different languages. Con   tacts between families affected by the same genetic cause is possible in an anonymous way, creating gene or CNV specific social networks to which in terested professionals could be associated, akin to disease specific patients associations. Anonymized summary data will be accessible to families and to professionals. We will present the structure and features of the GenIDA social network that is currently in its beta testing phase.This innovative strategy to collect information on natural history and co morbidities of rare monogenic forms of ID/autism will promote familiesÃ¢ÂÂ empowerment and hopefully impact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ care.

Copy number variations (CNV) in RBFOX1, also known as A2BP1, have been associated with human neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disease.This gene, spanning 1.7 MB on chromosome 16p13.3, is one of the largest genes in the human genome, responsible for encoding splicing regulatory factors, specifically expressed in neurons and muscles, and having a regula  tory action in alternative splicing of a large tissue specific gene networks. Materials and methods: Oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, using an Agi  lent 4x180K platform, was performed in 1200 patients with mental retarda tion, autism spectrum disorders and congenital anomalies. Results: In our cohort, we identified 6 cases with intragenic deletions in RB  FOX1, 4 of them with additional CNV in other chromosomes.

747," Identification of an inherited splicing SCN8A mutation in a family with intellectual disability, autism, ataxia and seizures by whole exome sequencing",PM08.62,,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) can identify causes of abnormal clinical  phenotypes. We report a 15 year old boy and his 9 year old brother with  normal karyotypes and SNP array findings who showed moderate intellec  tual disability (ID), autism and speech delay. The older boy had abnormal  EEG and showed absence seizures since the age of 9 years. The younger boy presented ataxia at the age of 5 years. Their mother showed mild ID, as did the maternal grandmother and a maternal uncle.WES of the brothers and their mother identified a heterozygous splicing SC  N8A  mutation (NM_014191, c.1134+1G>A) which was absent in all exome  databases. It was confirmed using Sanger sequencing in both boys, their mo ther, grandmother and uncle, and predicted to disrupt the splice donor of in tron 9, with exon 9 skipping being one of the likely outcomes. Sequencing of lymphocyte cDNA of the carriers confirmed this aberrant transcript leading to frameshift and premature termination (p.G331GfsX11). The interpreta tion of this variant transcript is however complicated by its presence also in normal controls. Other variant transcripts and differences in transcript ratios are under study.Multiple SCN8A mutations have been reported, mostly de novo missense  variants in patients showing predominantly seizures, while one truncating variant segregated in a family with a broader spectrum of cognitive and be havioural deficits. Our findings may support the notion that while missen   se SCN8A  mutations causing increased channel activity can be associated  mainly with seizures, heterozygous loss of function mutations may predis   pose to a slightly different phenotype.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.",2015.0,,"D.

773, The autism associated long noncoding RNA MSNP1AS regulates a network of genes involved in neuronal process stability.,PM09.016,,"From genome wide association studies (GWAS), a novel gene was discove  red that has a highly significant association with autism spectrum disorder  (ASD). The gene is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) designated MSNP1AS  (moesin pseudogene 1, antisense). Expression of MSNP1AS was increased  in the cerebral cortex of individuals with ASD and individuals with the ASD associated genetic marker. Overexpression of MSNP1AS in human neuronal  cells caused decreased expression of moesin (MSN) mRNA and moesin pro  tein, which is involved in neuronal process stability and immune response. These data indicate one aspect of the potential contribution of increased  MSNP1AS expression in ASD. However, there are likely to be additional  transcriptomic impacts of this lncRNA. To determine the effects of altered MSNP1AS expression on the neuronal transcriptome, we transfected human  neuronal progenitor cells with constructs that overexpressed MSNP1AS or  transcriptionally silenced MSNP1AS. RNA Seq analysis indicated altered  expression of multiple genes that contribute to altered neuronal process stability and immune response, including MSN. However, our data indica  te several genes that are impacted by MSNP1AS dysregulation more signi  ficantly than MSN, suggesting a network of genes that contribute to ASD risk.

774, Expression profile of circulating miRNAs in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),PS09.017,,"Introduction: ASD is a genetically complex disorder, highly heterogeneous and with unclear etiology. In this study we addressed the possible contri bution of epigenetic factors to ASD etiology, focusing on deregulated Mi croRNAs (miRNAs) expression. miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. miRNAs are thought to be released from pathological tissues to plasma in illness situations, and the strong correlation between circulating and tissue miRNAs indicates that plasma miRNAs may be useful disease biomarkers.Methods: miRNA plasma profiles were obtained for patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), essentially disruptive beha vior, language delay and psychomotor delay. Patients were all male, with a mean developmental coefficient of 92ÃÂ±18, and no obvious dysmorphisms. Exiqon human miRNome PCR panels (testing 752 miRNAs) were used for miRNA profiling.Results: We identified 50 miRNAs differentially expressed in ASD vs NDD. Notably, of the 10 miRNAs with higher fold change (increased 2.5 3.3X), 8 miRNAs had a target gene in common, MMP16. This gene is expressed at high levels in the brain, and a balanced de novo translocation in a ASD pati   ent involving MMP16 has previously been described.Conclusions: This is the first study of circulating miRNA profiles comparing patients with ASD and other NDDs. The preliminary results suggest that miRNA profilling may eventually improve differential diagnosis. The results also implicate novel pathological pathways in ASD, namely involving metal   oproteinases. These are crucial molecules for the integrity of the extracellu   lar matrix and consequently for cell migration and regeneration, processes thought to be involved in ASD.",2015.0,,"I. C.

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of  generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene  hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach  towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with  an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high  resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor   matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes  using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et  al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected:  deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1  (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du  plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83,  RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM   PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and  axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests  generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able  to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome  determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor   matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental condi   tion with highly complex genetic predisposition. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of both sequence and structural rare variations in ASD susceptibility. In particular, focusing on rare copy number variants (CNVs) has already been highly productive in uncovering an increasing num ber of specific genes and chromosomal intervals conferring risk to ASD.During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach on 9 multiplex ASD families from Sardinia, we identified a rare genic deletion of ~37 Kb, transmitted from the unaffected mother to both affected siblings. This deletion includes the entire CAPG gene and the last coding exons of  ELMOD3 . CAPG encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin re  gulatory proteins, that might be involved in control of dendritic spine shape. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, with recently proposed functional links to sound perception and actin cytoske leton.No deletions involving this genomic region were found in 4768 controls from published high resolution SNP array data, while other two deletions encompassing CAPG and ELMOD3 have been reported in two subjects with  ASD, suggesting that CAPG and/or ELMOD3 haploinsufficiency may have  clinical relevance to ASD. In order to test this hypothesis together with a recessive model of inheritance, we first excluded that this deletion is a com mon polymorphism in Sardinia, then we performed expression and muta   tion analysis of both genes in the discovery pedigree, and a further clinical evaluation of all family members.Grant references: Fondazione Banco di Sardegna, Kyulan Family Foundati o",2015.0,,"E.

Two were inherited from the healthy mother, one from an affected mother and one had an unknown parental origin. The duplication was confirmed by qPCR and a significant  overexpression of the four duplicated genes was found using quantitative  gene expression analysis. Two patients were diagnosed with Autism Spec trum Disorder, one with Developmental Delay and one is non verbal and  has a severe Intellectual Disability (the latter patient carries an additional  pathogenic imbalance on the X chromosome). Strong evidence supports the role of this duplication in abnormal neurodevelopment. These four genes  are all implicated in axonal growth, neuronal connectivity and morphology,  especially CYFIP1 which regulates translation at the synapse by binding to FMRP . Phenotypically normal and mildly affected carriers complicate the phenotypic association and/or causality of this aberration. The explanation of this variability may be found in the reduced penetrance or altered gene dosage on a particular genetic background.

Different studies have already pointed to  an impairment of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity as an underlying cause of SCZ pathology. To elucidate a putative contribution of genetic SHANK3 variants  to the etiology of SCZ, we sequenced the gene in 500 affected individuals and compared the sequencing results to ancestral   ly matched controls. Novel SHANK3 missense variants were identified in 1.6 % of the screened individuals, three of which were predicted as deleterious by at least two different algorithms. We identified association of 5 genetic variants, with study wide significance(P<0.001). Combined with previous studies, the rare G>V variant was  found in 4 out of 1543 SCZ patients and in 4 out of 2147 individuals with autismspectrum disorders (ASD), but not in 9315 controls.We conclude that the SHANK3  gene harbors different genetic variations predisposing to SCZ, ranging from common and uncommon va riants torare deleterious missense mutations.

893, Unexpected molecular genetic findings by Next Generation Sequencing in a young ataxia patient,PM09.134,,"Introduction: An 18 year old patient of non consanguineous parents had ataxic symptoms since age 16. The symptoms in the once excellent student were accompanied by progressive dementia, psychiatric changes, ocu lar apraxia, vertical ophthalmoparesis and non specific elevations of liver enzymes, lactate and CK. He has a similarly affected younger brother. His maternal grandfather had psychiatric issues, his motherÃ¢ÂÂs brother suffers from schizophrenia, autism, hypotonia and gait disturbance.Materials and Methods: The patient was evaluated for Niemann Picktype C disease and SCA17 but no mutation could be identified. His DNA was then subjected to Next Generation Sequencing of 128 ataxia associated genes and the results worked up clinically and segregated in the brother and mother.Results: The patient has a heterozygous SYNE1 variant once associated with autosomal dominant Emery Dreyfuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD4) as well as hete rozygous mutations in WFS1 and PEX7, and a likely pathogenic variant in VPS13A. Of those, only the WFS1 mutation was also present in his brother. All mutations had been inherited through the mother. VPS13A alone has not been segregated. The genetic diagnosis of EDMD4 was not confirmed by mu scle biopsy. In the course of disease his brother developed diabetes insipi   dus and signs of celiac disease. Both brothers have deteriorating vision that could indicate optic atrophy (ophthalmologic exam is pending).Conclusion: The clinical presentation is now in line with Wolfram syndro me but a second mutation is warranted.

DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF ROMANIAN CHILDREN WITH WIL  LIAMS BEUREN SYNDROME (WBS) OBJECTIVE: The present study focuses on the evaluation of the clinical cha  racteristics of pediatric patients with WBS, to design a personalized manage   ment plan, to prevent the complications and to improve the prognostic.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 22 children clinically and genetically dia  gnosed with WBS. The clinical diagnosis was based on the WBS diagnostic  scoring system; FISH tests were performed to confirm the diagnostic.RESUL TS: All children were refered to our department for intellectual disa   bility; 35% of them associated motor delay and 48%, poor language deve lopment. All children presented specific facial dysmorphism. Most children had particular behavior: temporal spatial disorientation, hyperacusis, and  attraction to music (100%); hypersociability (65%); hyperkinesias (35%);  fussy eating patterns (12%). 17% of the children had cardiovascular dis   orders and 6% presented hypercalcemia. Some children presented atypical  features: 2 children had autism and 1 child associated Marfan syndrome.  29% of patients were enrolled in physical therapy, and 42%, in different ty   pes of cognitive and behavioral therapy. Most of these children improved in their psychomotor development, well integrating in regular education. 12%  of the children were not enrolled in any therapeutic program and presented  very slow psychomotor aquisitions, thus preventing their enrollment in any type of education. CONCLUSIONS: Most of our patients presented the classical picture of  WBS, but some children had different particularities which contributed to  a delayed diagnosis. The management of WBS patients requires a multidis ciplinary approach, and is essential for a better social integration of these children.Acknowledgments: National Research Project PN 09.33.02.03; PN II 42 130",2015.0,,"I.

Our case, diagnosed with schizophrenia, also presents manifestations that are characteristic for  autistic spectrum disorders. Based on her academic performances, our pati   ent might have a superior than average intellect. The result of the arrayCGH analysis showed genomic imbalances including  several genes. From the list of deleted/duplicated genes, one that was pre  viously reported in patients with psychotic disorders is the SHANK3 gene. ArrayCGH analysis for our case identified an 82.3 Kb duplication of chro  mosome 22q from 51.055.575 51.137.968 bp; this region encompassed the  SHANK3. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother did not carry the duplication. The genetic analysis for father was not possible because he is deceased. Several papers have reported SHANK3 gene variants in autistic spectrum consisting of both  copy number variants and point mutations. The presence of three copies of the SHANK3 gene was reported in associa   tion with autistic spectrum disorders in other papers.

1253, Mosaic patterns can be missed by SNP array because of absence of heterozygosity in the normal cells,PS13.35,,"Introduction: SNP array allows the integration of genotype and copy num ber information, which permits the simultaneous detection of (low level  mosaic) copy number variations, consanguinity and UPD in cases of isodi   somy. We report on a case where a mosaic pattern was missed by SNP array  due to the absence of heterozygosity in the normal cells. Case presentation: Array analysis of non consanguineous parents was per  formed because the array result of their child showed a terminal deletion of  at least 4.3 Mb in 6q27 (chr6: 166,863,544 qter). An Illumina Omni Express  850K was used for the trio analysis and the mother showed the same deleti  on. While the mother is healthy, the child presented with moderate develop  mental delay, autism and delay of motor skills. Distal 6q deletions have been  described in literature and the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ main characteristics are intellectual  disability, hypotonia, seizures, brain anomalies and specific dysmorphic fea  tures. At least part of the clinical features of the child can be explained by this deletion. Because the mother has no phenotypic features we considered a mosaic pattern for the deletion. Therefore we performed FISH resulting in detection of the deletion in 49 of the 100 analyzed metaphases indicating that the mother is indeed a mosaic carrier for the deletion.Conclusion: The reason we missed the mosaic pattern and only detected the deletion must have been caused by the absence of heterozygosity of the critical region. Therefore, we recommend FISH analysis in case a healthy carrier has a deletion to detect a possible mosaic pattern.",2015.0,,"B. Leegte, P . Rump, B. Sikkema   Raddatz, M. Benjamins, T .

1255, Non mosaic structural chromosome rearrangements predisposing to larger mosaic ones: evidences for the existence of locus specific constitutional chromosome instability,PS13.37,,"I.

The origins of somatic genome variations manifesting as structural chro mosomal rearrangements remain largely unknown. However, it is generally  accepted that susceptibility to structural chromosome aberrations can be  produced by alterations to DNA sequences flanking the breakpoints or to rearranged chromosomal regions (i.e. CNV). Addressing genome variations  in children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital  malformations (n,200) by high resolution CNV analysis (molecular karyo typing; resolution: 1 kbp or higher), we have surprisingly found that somatic structural chromosome abnormalities can co occur with non mosaic ones  within the same loci. More precisely, we detected 8 cases (4%) (4 dupli  cations and 4 deletions) demonstrating small non mosaic structural chro mosome rearrangements encompassed by larger mosaic ones. The dupli  cations were mosaic dup3p26.3p26.1 (5.8 Mb) vs. regular dup3p26.1 (2.9  Mb); mosaic dup14q32.13q32.2 (4.5 Mb) vs. regular dup14q32.2 (1.8 Mb); mosaic dup17p13.1p11.2 (6.9 Mb) vs. regular dup17p12 (1.4 Mb); mosaic  dup18p11.32p11.31 (5.3 Mb) vs. regular dup18p11.32p11.31 (4.8 Mb). The  deletions were mosaic del5q35.1q35.3 (9.2 Mb) vs. regular del5q35.2q35.3 (2.3 Mb); mosaic del14q11.2 (2.2 Mb) vs. regular del14q11.2 (0.5 Mb); mo saic del15q13.1q14 (8.2 Mb) vs. regular del15q13.2q13.3 (2 Mb); mosaic  delXp22.32p22.2 (4.7 Mb) vs. regular delXp22.31 (0.7 Mb). These findings  allowed us to hypothesize small regular structural variations (CNV) to be able to produce locus specific constitutional chromosome instability resul  ting in larger somatic rearrangements.

Taking into account the existence of known syndromes, relevant genes for the phenotype and CNVs in healthy population, we have proposed the classification of CNVs into different classes: Class I are deletions/duplications in regions associated with a syndrome; Class II are deletions/duplications not reported in normal subjects and involving known coding genes; Class III are /duplications re ported in low frequency in normal subjects or not involving genes; Class IV are deletions/duplications reported in healthy subjects  common variants.We have revisited 250 cases with intellectual disability and/or Autism spec trum disorders, analyzed by oligonucleotide array CGH (Agilent 4x180K platform) from 2011 and 2012 in order to evaluate if the observed CNVs would be reclassified according to the update of databases.In~70% of the reviewed cases there were no changes in the CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ classi fication. In the other ~30% of cases: 1 classification changed from Class II to I, 10 from II to IIIA, 5 from II to IV, 17 from IIIA to IV, 3 from IIIB to IIIA, 45 from IIIB to IV. About 95% of the classification changes made reduced the probability of the imbalance being responsible for the phenotype.Although progress and knowledge have improved the content of databases, the findings of this revision have not changed the clinical strategy neither the management of patients.

1473, Genomic/epigenomic defects associated with surprisingly detected parental consanguinity uncovered by molecular karyotyping with SNP arrays,PS17.09,,"Parental consanguinity is generally accepted to be a risk factor for hereditary diseases. However, parents may not know about their consanguinity. As a re sult, clinical genetic evaluation is unable to provide a preliminary diagnosis for performing targeted molecular genetic diagnosis. Fortunately, there do exist whole genome scanning techniques making possible to detect not only genomic but also epigenomic variations (i.e. segmental loss of heterozygo sity or SLOH) for evaluating levels of consanguinity. Here, we have analyzed genomes of 188 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformations using SNP/oligonucleotide molecular karyoty   ping (Affymetrix) and an original bioinformatic technology for addressing phenotypic, cellular and molecular consequences of genomic/epigenomic variations. SLOH, specific to clinical manifestations in these children, were found in 6 cases (3.2%). It is to note that parental consanguinity was not initially reported in all these cases. In one child, Meier Gorlin syndrome was diagnosed. Other cases were also associated with hereditary diseases. Two cases of SLOH indirectly related to the phenotype were associated with mi crodeletions in 14q22.1 and 15q15.2, respectively. Parental consanguinity has long been considered as a source of knowledge about origins of here ditary diseases. In the present study, the possibility of genetic analyses of children born in consanguineous marriages has been extended by whole genome and bioinformatic analyses. Actually, it has been shown that sur prisingly detected consanguinity can be relatively common and molecular diagnosis using SNP arrays and bioinformatics can be useful for revealing of mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic diseases.

The maintenance of such heritable and low reproductive trait in the human population is an evolutionary enigma that likely left a signature in ASD genes. To test this hypothesis, we studied the allelic characteristics of 441 ASD genes and 15,144 non ASD genes in a whole exome sequencing dataset, which included data on 503,481 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 1351 European Americans, and 1088 African Americans individuals.

The mutational dearth in ASD genes was particularly eminent when considering only SNVs with functional consequences, a possible effect of negative selection. Inte restingly, ASD genes also showed signs of positive selection, but these were less evident (P<0.09). We used these genomic characteristics to generate a multivariate model that classified ASD from non ASD genes with 72% ac curacy.

10,Mendel Lecture: Epigenetics and Rett syndrome,PL4.1,,"The word epigenetics excites great interest within biology and beyond, despite uncertainty about its definition. At one level it concerns the signi ficance of the plethora of chemical marks on chromosomes that modulate gene activity (collectively known as the Ã¢ÂÂepigenomeÃ¢ÂÂ). Prominent among these marks is DNA methylation   a modification that is directly applied to DNA and affects its interaction with proteins. Several clinical disorders invol ve genes that interpret or lay down the epigenome. For example, the autism spectrum disorders Rett syndrome and MECP2 duplication syndrome are caused by mutations in the gene for the protein MeCP2. The MeCP2 protein binds to sites on DNA that are chemically altered by DNA methylation and appears to interpret this Ã¢ÂÂepigeneticÃ¢ÂÂ mark to affect gene expression. Clues to the function of MeCP2 are provided by the spectrum of mutations causing Rett syndrome and the biochemical and genetic analyses. Recent evidence derived from animal and cellular models suggests that the primary function of this protein is to restrain transcription in a DNA methylation dependent manner. Interestingly, the resulting defects are reversible in model systems suggesting that the disorder may be curable. Current research addressing these aspects of MeCP2 biology will be presented.

141,A Complex Mutational Spectrum of Structural Variation Contributing to Autism,C15.1,,"Recent genomic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have relied upon genome wide characterization of coding mutations using whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variants (CNV) using chromosomal microarray (CMA). In ASD, these efforts have revealed a strong associati on with de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and CNVs segments that alter the dosage of genes under evolutionary constraint. Unfortunately, the impact of balanced and complex structural variation (SV), which also repre sent LoF variation, remains uncharacterized in ASD and other human disea   se studies. Here, we explored the full mutational spectrum of SV contribu ting to ASD by integrating large insert, short insert and synthetic long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies with CMA in 307 idiopathic ASD probands and 120 family members from the Simons Simplex Collec tion. Analyses revealed a diverse landscape of SVs beyond canonical CNVs, including inversions, insertions, and translocations. We also categorized 13 distinct subclasses of recurrent complex SVs and demonstrate that each ge nome sequenced harbored at least one such large complex rearrangement (~5 kb resolution). We identified 26 de novo SVs likely contributing to ASD, 50% of which were cryptic to detection by previous technologies on the se same samples. These data confirmed 13 previously proposed ASD risk factors and discovered 12 novel candidates. We estimate that the overall contribution of de novo SVs in ASD at this resolution to be at least 8.2%, or a two fold increase over previous analyses restricted to CNVs. These data suggest that cryptic and complex SV represent an important and presently underappreciated component of ASD etiology.

143, Disruption of POGZ is associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders,C15.3,,"Introduction: Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are genetically heterogeneous, and associated genes for both condi   tions overlap substantially. Few mutations in POGZ were reported in recent exome studies. However, these studies did not provide detailed clinical in formation, leaving the pathogenicity and a clear phenotypic definition of the POGZ patient unknown.Patients and Methods: We collected the clinical and molecular data of 25 individuals with disruptive mutations in POGZ identified by diagnostic who le exome, whole genome, or targeted sequencing of 5,223 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (ID primarily) or by targeted resequencing of this locus in 12,041 individuals with ASD and/or ID. In parallel, we utili   zed a Drosophila knockdown model of the POGZ orthologue row to provide further support for the importance of POGZ in cognitive function.Results: We defined common phenotypic features of POGZ patients, inclu   ding variable levels of developmental delay and more severe speech and language delay compared to motor delay and coordination issues. We also identified significant associations with vision problems, microcephaly, hy   peractivity, a tendency to obesity and feeding difficulties. In addition, we found that downregulation of row expression, specifically in neurons, leads to deficits in habituation, a form of non associative learning that is highly relevant for both ID and ASD. Conclusion: Combined, these data underscore the pathogenicity of loss of  function mutations in POGZ and define a novel POGZ related syndrome. Some features may be explained by the high expression of POGZ early in fetal brain development, particularly in the cerebellum and pituitary.",2016.0,,"H. A. F. Stessman, M. H. Willemsen, M.

169, Haploinsufficiency of MECP2 interacting transcriptional co repressor SIN3A causes mild intellectual disability by affecting the development of cortical integrity,C19.5,,"Next generation sequencing has revealed numerous genes that are asso   ciated with a broad range of neurodevelopmental disorders including in tellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but detailed knowledge of their associated protein dysfunction is mostly lacking. Here, we identified dominant mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptio nal repressor and MeCP2 interactor switch insensitive 3 family member A (SIN3A) in individuals with predominantly mild ID who display a strikingly similar facial gestalt and various additional features as ASD, microcephaly, short stature, epilepsy, hypermobile joints and hearing loss. Brain MRIs re vealed subtle abnormalities, such as corpus callosum hypoplasia and ven triculomegaly. Intriguingly, in vivo functional knockdown of SIN3A using in utero electroporation led to changes in the developing mouse brain such as reduced cortical neurogenesis, altered neuronal identity and aberrant cortico cortical projections, observations that have a high translational va lue with the clinical features of our individuals. Together, our data establish that haploinsufficiency of SIN3A is associated with mild ID and associated characteristics as observed in the atypical 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, and that Sin3A is a key transcriptional regulator crucial for proper develop mental expansion and connectivity of cortical brain areas.This work was supported by funding from Science without Borders, CAPES Brasil (BEX 12044/13 0) to T .C.D.D, The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development, ZonMw (grant 907 00 365) to T .K., the Dutch Brain Foundation (HsN F2014(1) 16) to J.E.V. and the German Mini stry of Research and Education (grant numbers 01GS08164, 01GS08167, 01GS08163 German Mental Retardation Network) to H.E. and T .M.S.",2016.0,,"J.

Myhre syndrome/LAPS is a rare cause of syndromic limitation of the range of joint motion, generally presenting with variable degrees of intellectual disability and short stature. Fifty six molecularly proven cases have been reported in the medical literature to date.Clinical report. The patient was born SGA at term as the only child of healthy Italian parents. Paternal and maternal ages at conception were 39 and 31 years respectively. We evaluated the girl at 14 years. Cardinal history fin dings were delayed motor milestones with normal speech development and a full scale IQ of 74; mild autistic traits; stiffness gradually involving small and large joints and resulting in pronounced functional impairment of the shoulder girdle and tibiotarsal joints in her early teens; GH defici   ency; thelarche variant; bilateral chronic otitis media with effusion lea   ding to tympanosclerosis; marked retinal vessel tortuosity; astigmatism; laryngospasm during procedural sedation. Congenital heart disease (CHD) requiring surgery (tetralogy of Fallot and peripheral pulmonary stenosis) was identified at 2 weeks of age. Her long standing hepatomegaly, alrea dy present at 6 months, and mild protein losing enteropathy might be pa thogenetically related to perturbed extracellular matrix homoeostasis, as both of them were not significantly modified either by cardiac therapies or, more recently, by constrictive pericarditis.

497, Expression of COX7A1 as a potential marker of congenital heart defects,P05.24,,"* Congenital heart defects occur in approximately 50% of children with Down syndrome and in 1% of general population. The most common de   fects include ventricular septal defect (VSD), common atrioventricular chan nel (CAVC) and atrial septal defect (ASD). These defects are usually detected by means of fetal sonographic examination performed during pregnancy. We aimed at defining a molecular blood marker, which could allow for ear ly detection of such defects in case of prenatal testing, performed due to suspected congenital malformation.* Methods: * We conducted a whole genome expression analysis in 21 child ren with Down syndrome, with or without congenital heart defect. We used microarray technology to compare the whole genome expression in blood mononuclears between both subgroups. Next we used GeneSpring software for data analysis. Moderated t test was applied with the Westfall Young cor   rection for mutliple comparisons to detect significant differences between compared groups.* Results: * We found upregulation of the COX7A1 gene in patients born with  heart defect (Fold Change 2.83). The COX7A1 protein is one of the nuclear coded polypeptide chains of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal oxidase in mitochondrial electron transport in the muscle cell, and can play a role in heart muscle pathology.

545, A BCAT2 mutation causes a novel inborn error of metabolism due to mitochondrial branched chain amino acid aminotransferase deficiency and results in developmental delay and autism,P06.04,,"Introduction: Plasma amino acid profile in an adolescent boy with history of early onset developmental delay and autism revealed profoundly elevated levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAA)   leucine, valine and isoleuci ne, without an increase in their coressponding branched chain 2 ketoacids. Notably, alloisoleucine was not detected and Maple Syrup Urine Disease was ruled out. The biochemical phenotype suggested a defect in the first step of BCAA catabolism.Results: Targeted Sanger sequencing of BCAT2 gene that encodes mitochon   drial BCAA aminotransferase revealed a novel homozygous inframe dele tion (NM_001190; c136_147del; p.His46_Pro49del). Studies conducted on patientÃ¢ÂÂs fibroblasts demonstrated a marked reduction in valine oxidation and somewhat impaired leucine oxidation supporting a deficiency of the BCAT enzyme. Protein structural analysis and additional functional studies are ongoing to elucidate the mechanism linking the mutation and enzyme activity.Conclusion: Till date, there is only one reported case of BCAT2 deficiency in the literature that resulted from two compound missense heterozygous BCAT2 mutations in a 25 year old man with normal development and six year history of headaches with mild memory impairment (Wang et al 2015). Our findings lead to discovery of a novel inborn error of catabolism of BCAAs caused by an inframe BCAT2 deletion resulting in developmental delay and autism.References1. Wang XL et al.

Samples were received from patients with mental re tardation, epilepsy, autism and/or congenital anomalies. When parental samples were available, the familiar study was performed.Results: We have identified 5 patients with microdeletion and 3 patients with microduplication 1q21.1. One patient with microdeletion was referred for microcephaly and the other 4 patients for developmental abnormalities or mental retardation. In two cases the parents are also affected. We have only one case of parental samples and the deletion was of paternal origin. Two patients with microduplication were referred for epilepsy and the other one by autism. All have macrocephaly.

Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping by SNP/oligonucleotide mi  croarray (resolution: >1kbp) was used to analyze 300 children with ID, au   tism spectrum disorders and congenital malformations. Results. Cytogenetically visible 2q37 deletions were detected in 2 cases.  Molecular karyotyping confirmed the presence of these deletions (5Mb and 8.5Mb).

Here, we reflect on our 5 year experience (2011 to 2015) with the implementation of arrayCGH.Different array platforms were used with increasing probe density and, since 2013, included SNPs to investigate patients whose phenotype was consistent with an imprinting disorder or an autosomal recessive disorder caused by autozygosity. We examined 1414 patients belonging to 1261 fa milies (95 prenatally, 1319 postnatally), who were referred mostly for intel lectual disability, autism and/or congenital abnormalities.In 10/95 (11%) prenatal and in 365/1319 (28%) postnatal cases we identi fied possibly relevant copy number variations (CNV) or regions of absence of heterozygosity (AOH). Overall there were 1125 relevant CNVs that required further investigation originating 468 reportable CNVs (203 deletions, 265 duplications), ranging in size from 43kb (intragenic deletion of MBD5 ) to  154Mb (X aneuploidy). After segregation analysis and/or confirmatory tests, 266 variants were classified as pathogenic and 202 as of uncertain clinical significance. We also detected an AOH containing a gene associated with Bardet Biedl syndrome, consistent with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype, and a case of partial UPD(14).Large size rearrangements can be benign and, conversely, very small size CNVs may be pathogenic. The global analysis of our array database suggests a postnatal cut off of 30kb and, for prenatal reporting, a 150kb cut off for deletions and a 200kb for duplications. However, we recommend analyzing each case on an individual basis and in close connection with the clinicians.",2016.0,,"R. Silveira Santos, A. Sousa, S. CustÃÂ³dio, S. Serafim, J. Dupont, O.

650, Clinical utility of whole exome sequencing; case report of a child with global neurodevelopmental delay focused on autism spectrum disorder,P08.13,," Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD, OMIM#209850) are a group of heterogeneous neurobehavioral syndromes without an accurate  molecular genetics protocol after a non conclusive karyotype, fragile X and  CGH array tests results. Here we report the case of a two years old child, born at 41 weeks gestation after induced labor for oligohydramnios, with a  global neurodevelopmental delay focused on ASD, a suggestive hereditary  family history and normal karyotype, fragile X and CGH array tests. Who le exome sequencing was performed to depict the complex genetics autism spectrum disorder. Material and methods: Exome sequencing and selective analysis of ASD  known genes was applied at first. Then a second analysis extended to re maining OMIM genes was carried out (qGenomics Laboratory) Results: ASD related genes analysis did not reveal any significant finding,  but the extended study to other OMIM genes identified a likely pathogenic mutation in GDI1 gene (c.389 1G> C; hemizygous splicing variant). This  gene has been strongly associated with intellectual disabilities (ID) although  there is only evidence from 3 published families with X linked ID and GDI1 mutations (one nonsense, two missense) (Strobl Wildemann G, et al. Am J Med Genet A. 2011). Conclusions: The mutation found in the studied family provides more evi  dence about the GDI1 role in X linked ID. Furthermore, GDI1 seems to be related also to another clinical feature, ASD. Our findings suggest including GDI1 in ASD panels as well as in X linked intellectual disabilities. Finally, our  work underlines the utility of whole exome sequencing instead of specific  gene panels for an accurate diagnosis and complete genetic counselling.",2016.0,,"A. VallmajÃÂ³, D.

651, Targeted gene panel to investigate intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders comorbidity,P08.14,,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinical   ly and genetically heterogeneous diseases. Recent whole exome sequencing studies indicated that genes associated with different neurologic disorders are shared among these disorders or converge on common functional pa thways.The aim of this study was to design a customized multiplex PCR based gene panel to investigate the genetic bases of ID and ASD comorbidity. The gene panel covers 74 genes, including a subset of genes that are found recurrently mutated in ID or ASD conditions, genes shared among ID and ASD disease network and ID/ASD genes that are directly connected to these. We analy   zed 18 clinically selected patients with ID and ASD without syndromic fea tures, negative for Fragile X test and array CGH. For all 18 patients, 85 97% of the targeted regions achieved read depths of at least 20x, with average read depths ranging from 91x to 612x. 22 rare single nucleotide variants (SNV) were found in the exonic sequences of 16 out of the 18 patients: most of them are predicted to be deleterious and have very low frequency or are no present in public databases. Although familial segregation analysis will be helpful to determine the pathogenic nature of the variants, likely causa tive variants have been assigned for 8 (44%) of the patients. These results confirm the diagnostic value of the targeted gene panel for investigating children with ID and ASD.Funding: Italian Ministry of health Young Investigator Grant GR 2011 02347754 to E.L.",2016.0,,"E.

663,Foxp1 related intellectual disability syndrome: a recognizable entity,P08.27,,"Introduction: Intellectual disability (ID) and specific language impairment (SLI) cover a wide range of conditions with heterogeneous phenotypes and  etiologies, making them challenging for clinical geneticists. Mutations in  forkhead box protein P1 (FOXP1), a transcription regulator, are associated with ID and SLI, with or without autistic features (MIM: 613670). Multiple  FOXP1 patients have been described, though so far, no specific phenotype  emerged. Materials and Methods: We report on the clinical and molecular data of 21 novel and well characterized patients with FOXP1 mutations and review the  25 previously reported FOXP1 patients to delineate the condition. Results: Phenotypic analysis shows a combination of neuromotor delay, ID,  SLI, and typical facial features including a high broad forehead, bent downs  lanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, blepharophimosis, and a short nose with bulbous tip. Relative macrocephaly, strabismus, a wide mouth with down turned corners, and pronounced nasolabial folds appear more variable.  Behavioural problems and autistic features are common. Brain, cardiac and  urogenital malformations seem associated. Molecular data show de novo  mutations in all cases, either monogenic or part of a more extended intersti   tial 3p deletions. Subgroup analysis reveals sensorineural hearing loss and  more severe ID in patients with interstitial 3p deletions. Conclusions: FOXP1 related ID syndrome is a recognizable entity that seems  more frequent than expected. We expand the phenotypic description with  typical facial features and associated organ system involvements. This will enable clinicians to make a gestalt diagnosis and will be helpful to evaluate genotype phenotype correlations when interpreting large NGS data obtai   ned in patients with ID and/or SLI.",2016.0,,"I.

676, Diagnosis of intellectual disability by sequencing all genes known in pathology,P08.42,,"The etiologies of intellectual disability (ID) are very heterogeneous. For this reason, exome sequencing is increasingly used in the diagnosis of ID.We sequenced 151 index cases with the Illumina TruSight One panel which targets the coding sequences of 4813 genes involved in human pathology. Our aim was a diagnostic yield close to exome sequencing but less expensi ve. All patients had a negative diagnostic work up before sequencing inclu   ding chromosome microarray analysis.A definitive or likely diagnosis was found for 42 index cases (28%) in 39 different genes: 30 were autosomal dominant (de novo or with a low mo saicism in one parent), 6 were autosomal recessive, 6 were X linked. We also made 4 partial diagnoses which do not explain the whole phenotype. Besi  des, 10 variants were classified as variants of unknown significance. Finally, we identified 7 incidental findings irrelevant with the indication.In our series, 56 patients had autism and ID with normal motor develop ment and autistic regression. In these patients, we achieved a unique dia gnosis (1.7%); therefore our diagnostic yield was 42% among our 95 pati   ents with ID and no autism. We had also 35% diagnoses in our 40 patients with ID and epilepsy.Overall, this technique provides a significant advance in the diagnostic strat   egy of patients with ID. However, it highlights the need to better characterize its clinical indications. Mostly, our experience suggests that ID as part of an autistic syndrome is currently not a good indication due to the supposed multifactorial nature of this pathology.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  165Back to index",2016.0,,"B.

686,"Efficacy of GenIDA, a family oriented international online registry and clinical database for genetic forms of intellectual disability and/or autism, to collect medically relevant information on the Koolen de Vries Syndrome",P08.52,,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are over   lapping disorders that constitute a major public health problem with a cu  mulated frequency of about 2.5%. Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen   tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members.Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen   de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy   potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website.This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare diseases affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

696, Mosaic Xq26,P08.64,,"Introduction. Recurrent mosaic duplications are exclusive in the available literature. This is especially the case in terms of clinically relevant X chro mosome duplications in females. However, a growing amount of reports on somatic genome variations causing intellectual disability and congenital malformations allows speculations that mosaic (sub)chromosomal rear rangements might be more common and clinically relevant than previously recognized.Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping using SNP/oligonucleotide microarray (resolution: >1 kbp) was performed in a cohort of 402 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformati ons.Results. Four girls (~1%) have exhibited mosaic duplications spanning Xq26.2q26.3.The age varied from 1 year 1 month to 6 years. Shared features included intellectual disability/developmental delay, microcephaly, broad phyltrum and wide nasal bridge, long lashes, ptosis; one patient demonstrated autistic features. The overlapping region for all duplications included 8 genes: GPC3,  MIR19B2 , MIR106A, PHF6, HPRT1, MIR503, MIR424, PLAC1. Although non  mosaic duplication in this region involving genes PHF6 and HPRT1 has been  described in the literature previously, the lack of phenotypic resemblance to the detected cases and an original bioinformatics analysis allow the specu lation that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 might be a new chromosomal syndrome associated with intellectual disability and congenital malforma tions.Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 are relatively common in children with intellectual disability, autism, epi lepsy and/or congenital malformations. Furthermore, our findings demon   strate the possibility that mosaic chromosomal rearrangements can be a cause for a new chromosomal syndrome.

701," Effect of intranasal insulin on development in Phelan McDermid syndrome: a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial",P08.69,,"Introduction: Phelan McDermid (PMS) or 22q13.3 deletion syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Clinical features include moderate to severe intellectual disability and behavioural problems in the autism spec trum. Other researchers had observed a beneficial effect of intranasal insu lin on development and behaviour in a pilot study in six children with PMS. To validate this effect, we conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial using a stepped wedge design.Material and methods: Twentyfive children aged 1 to 16 years with a 22q13.3 deletion including the SHANK3 gene participated in the clinical trial for a period of 18 months. Starting 6 months before the trial, children were sy   stematically assessed for development and behaviour every 6 months. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th assessments were followed by daily nose sprays containing either insulin or placebo for a 6 month period. A 5th assessment was done directly after the end of the trial.Results: Intranasal insulin did not cause serious adverse events. It increased the level of developmental functioning by 0.4 1.4 months per 6 month pe riod that, while not statistically significant in this small group, was conside   red clinically relevant. A stronger, significant effect was observed in children older than 3 years, who usually show a decrease of developmental growth.Conclusions: Although the application of intranasal insulin is a promising therapeutic approach, clinical trials in larger study populations are required to prove the therapeutic effect of intranasal insulin in PMS.Grant: Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development 113 20 2009Contact: 22q13@umcg.nl",2016.0,,"R.

Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce   phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial   ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60  and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense  PUF60  mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked  coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60  and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced  different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome.We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty   ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four  nucleotides in PUF60  (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p.I136Tfs*31). The  patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60  which may be of key importance for the syndrome.

Upon exclusion  of 17p11.2 SMS locus deletion by previous genetic investigation, RAI1 muta   tional screening identified an unreported heterozygous missense mutation  (p.G1036R) inherited from the healthy father who shares with his daugh ter the facial aspect only. MLPA and RT qPCR analyses on RAI1 revealed a  wild type condition, whereas high resolution array CGH analysis disclosed  a rare de novo deletion at 16q24.3, never reported in healthy subjects. The deletion affects the last two exons and the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of ANKRD11. RT qPCR per  formed on the KBG gene revealed the simultaneous existence of wild type  and truncated mRNA, each present at 50% of the total amount detected in healthy controls.Based on these findings and considering that ANKRD11 mutations have been  reported in a few clinically borderline Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) patients, a  clinical revaluation of the proband was performed. Neither microcephaly and developmental delay, generally associated to CdLS, nor macrodontia  and short stature, hallmarks of the classic KBG phenotype, were observed.  However, the proband shows a composite phenotype mixing up KBG and  SMS signs. This peculiar clinical picture might result from the combined ef fect of RAI1 mutation and ANKRD11 de novo deletion, which does not likely imply gene haploinsufficiency, as in classical SMS and KBG syndromes.",2016.0,,"I.

706, Copy number variation in RBFOX1 and DOCK8: Neurodevelopmental disorders or benign variants?,P08.74,,"Deletions and duplications involving the genes RBFOX1 and DOCK8 have been implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disor   ders (ASD). However, the clinical significance of these CNVs is controversial. We analysed 14 RBFOX1 deletions (20 309 kb), six RBFOX1 duplications (34 kb to 1.34 Mb), and eight DOCK8 deletions (22 227 kb) from unrelated individuals. Our analysis revealed that five DOCK8 deletions were terminal and three were interstitial. Two deletions lie within intron 1, two include only exon 1, and four include multiple exons. Thirteen of the RBFOX1 de   letions lie within a single intron; deletion of intron 3 and intron 4 are the most common. Though the clinical information provided is limited, seven individuals with RBFOX1 deletions have a diagnosis of ASD. The clinical si gnificance of duplications is difficult to interpret since intragenic gains can lead to loss of function, whereas whole gene duplication can lead to triplo sensitivity. Half of the RBFOX1 duplications have one breakpoint upstream of the gene and one breakpoint in intron 2, which is predicted to maintain the reading frame if the duplications are in direct tandem orientation. One RBFOX1 duplication lies entirely within intron 3 and two include only exon 4, which could lead to an out of frame transcript. Our analysis sheds light on the genomic structures of small CNVs implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Only two CNVs had identical breakpoints, suggesting diversity in RBFOX1 and DOCK8 rearrangements rather than a few common variants. However, the clinical significance of these CNV remains unclear since all CNVs we included were inherited.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  173Back to index",2016.0,,"S.

709,Rubinstein Taybi syndrome type 2: Report of 9 new cases that extend the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum,P08.77,,"BACKGROUND: Rubinstein Taybi syndrome is an autosomal dominant  neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by growth deficiency, broad  thumbs and great toes, intellectual disability and characteristic craniofacial  appearance. Mutations in CREBBP account for around 55% of cases, with a further 8% attributed to the paralogous gene EP300. Comparatively few  reports exist describing the phenotype of Rubinstein Taybi due to EP300  mutations. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data were gathered from 9 pa tients from the UK and Ireland with pathogenic EP300 mutations, identified either by targeted testing or exome sequencing. RESULTS: All patients had  mild or moderate intellectual impairment. Behavioural or social difficul   ties were noted in eight, including three with autistic spectrum disorders.  Typical dysmorphic features of Rubinstein Taybi were only variably present.  Additional observations include maternal pre eclampsia (2/9), syndactyly  (3/9), delayed bone age (2/9), feeding or swallowing issues (2/9), scolio   sis (2/9) and hypermobility of the elbow (2/9). Six patients had truncating mutations in EP300, with pathogenic missense mutations identified in the remaining three. DISCUSSION: The findings support previous observations that microcephaly, maternal pre eclampsia, mild growth restriction and a mild to moderate intellectual disability are key pointers to the diagnosis of EP300 related Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Variability in the presence of typical facial features of Rubinstein Taybi further highlights clinical hetero geneity, particularly among patients identified by exome sequencing. Fea tures that overlap with Floating Harbor syndrome including craniofacial dysmorphism and delayed osseous maturation were observed in 3 patients.

741,Contribution of chromosomal aberrations in mosaicism to Autism Spectrum Disorders,P09.017,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequent  neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD has a strong genetic component in its  etiology, including de novo germ line mutations and copy number variants.  Detectable mosaicism for chromosomal rearrangements in blood has been reported in >1% of the aging population (>65y), but is very rare in young  people. Chromosomal mosaicism due to early developmental events could  be causative of ASD.Methods: We have studied molecular karyotypes (SNP array) of blood DNA of two large ASD datasets, the Autism Genome Project and the Simons Sim  plex Collection (4427 patients, 9268 parents, 2433 unaffected siblings) for  mosaic chromosomal alterations >0.4Mb, using the MAD and Tripod soft wares. As age matched controls, we also used reported data of 5094 child  ren with no developmental abnormalities. We independently analyzed data  from cell line DNA of 564 patients and 806 parents.Results: Mosaic alterations (0.4 155Mb) were detected in blood DNA of  21 out of 4427 patients (0,47%). A total of 34 events were also detected  in parental samples (0,37%) and 5/7517 unaffected children (0,07%). The frequency of detectable mosaicism is significantly higher in ASD patients. In cell line DNA, the frequency was similar in cases and parents although 6 unbalanced chromosomal translocations were detected in patients and just 1 in parents.Conclusion: Chromosomal aberrations present in mosaicism are detected in blood samples of a small but significant proportion of children with ASD (0,47%).

742, Genomic and genetic variation at complex segmental duplications in Autism Spectrum disorders,P09.018,,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most heri   table neurodevelopmental conditions but the aetiology remains elusive in a high proportion of cases. Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region.Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients  and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population.Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func  tional GTF2IRD2  genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls.  We also identified a disruptive mutation (p.M1?) in a GTF2IRD2  copy in two  affected brothers, inherited from their father. In the chr9 pericentromeric region, a de novo deletion was identified in a patient but the global distribu  tion of rearrangements and rare SNVs did not differ significantly between controls and patients.Conclusions: Despite their complex genetic architecture, our method suc cessfully identifies rearrangements and SNVs in SDs, such as copy gains and mutations at GTF2IRD2 or deletions of CNTNAP3 that could represent sus  ceptibility factors for ASD.Grant support: FISPI1302481/PI1300823/FEDER, 2014SGR1468 and FI DGR/2013.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  182Back to index",2016.0,,"M.

743, The power of New Generation Sequencing in identifying mutations in non specific ASD ID phenotypes: the example of SHANK3,P09.019,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by im  pairments in reciprocal social communication and stereotyped behaviors.  Intellectual Disability (ID) frequently coexists with these two core sym  ptoms. Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3  concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo  derate to profound ID. SHANK3  haploinsufficiency is frequently associated  with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs  to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing  of this gene.Materials and Methods: Here we report on 2 boys with ASD and ID and a girl  with severe ID associated with a SHANK3  mutation found by next generation  sequencing (NGS) study (Illumina). Results: Two of these mutations are truncated and de novo involving the  exon 21 in the prolin rich domain (NM_001080420.1:c.2955_2970dup  (p.(Pro992Arg*325) and NM_001080420.1:c.4381C>T (p.(Gln1461*)).

Rare copy number va riations (CNVs) play a significant role in ASD susceptibility.

Associations between these characteristics and total burden of CNVs as well as specific CNVs, were determined at P<0.01.Results: Rare CNVs were more prevalent among African American females. Interestingly, core ASD traits (i.e. communication and social difficulties) were associated with genomic burden of duplications whereas severity of clinical comorbidities (e.g. IQ, irritability, and pregnancy optimality scores) were associated with genomic burden of deletions. Further, we found asso   ciations between several clinical characteristics and specific ASD suscepti   bility CNV loci. Specifically, duplications in 15q11.2 q13.1, and in 16p11.2 were associated with a higher irritability, duplications in 22q11.21 were associated with a worse neonatal optimally score, and CNVs in 9p24.3 were associated with worse verbal ability.Conclusions: Our results suggests that rare CNVs contributes to the severity of ASD across several clinical and behavioral aspects.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  183Back to index",2016.0,,"I.

747, Comparison of CRISPR based methods for modeling loss of function in iPS cells,P09.023,,"Introduction: Given the rapid pace of discoveries that de novo loss of func   tion (LoF) mutations in highly conserved genes represent penetrant sources of genetic risk in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is imperative to gener   ate robust models that recreate the human cellular landscape, particularly  for neurological disorders where brain tissue is not readily available, and to  eliminate the confound of different genetic backgrounds. Methods: We used an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from a healthy male subject to perform dual guide CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of 9 independent genes for which LoF mutations represent strong risk factors  for ASD. The efficiency of 30 dual guide RNA combinations to generate dele  tions was then compared, using either FACS sorting or puromycin selection followed by serial dilutions to obtain single cell derived colonies. Results: Dual guide CRISPR successfully generated deletions in all genes,  however the efficiency varied widely by guide RNA and cellular protocol. The overall efficiency of the FACS method was 3.4% to generate predicted  ablations, out of 1002 colonies screened (range , 0%   10.6%). By contrast,  the puromycin method had an average efficiency of 15.1% from 4437 colo nies (range ,0%   32%).Conclusions: This systematic survey of genome editing approaches suggests that dual guide deletion generation varies widely by guide pair. We also find that the increased certainty of deriving a single cell from FACS sorting comes at a significant cost in terms of efficiency and cell viability compared to se   rial dilutions.Support: Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (SFRH/BD/52049/2012), Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, Autism Speak",2016.0,,"C.

748, Resilience formation against chronic stress: the Tsc2KO mouse model to study the involvement of the mTOR pathway,P09.024,,"Characteristic for autistic children is their reliability on well structured days and predictable procedures. Deviations of these cause stress in them and result in behavioural abnormalities. We therefore hypothesize that autistic children have reduced resilience for chronic stress. In order to analyse me chanism of stress resilience in autism we are using a Tsc2KO mouse model for tuberous sclerosis. TSC2 (together with TSC1) is part of a complex that inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. Mutations in either of the two genes result in increased mTOR activity and upregulated downstream signalling. mTOR signalling plays an important role in memory formation. It also is supposed to be a key player in stress resilience.According to these studies we have established a behaviour battery to ana   lyse the consequences of chronic social defeat in Tsc2KO animals. After a 14 daysÃ¢ÂÂ period of chronic stress exposure mice are being analysed in this battery, which consists of an object recognition test, an elevated plus maze test, a test of nest building, an evaluation of social interaction, sucrose pre ference, spontaneous alternation in a Y  maze test, a tail suspension test and the analysis of prepulse inhibition of startle response.First results show that non stressed Tsc2KO animals have alterations in social behaviour and in nest building when compared to wildtype mice. Of note, they also show an altered response to stress and changes in stress re silience. These data will give us closer insight into specific problems in au   tism and will also gain our understanding of mechanisms underlying stress resilience.",2016.0,,"A. Arlt, J. Winter, S.

The co existence of these two traits suggests com mon underlying mechanisms that require further exploration. Copy number variations (CNVs) are excellent candidate to mutually underlie these two di stinct conditions. Methods: We studied the association between CNVs and savant skills among  1108 children diagnosed with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) database. Savant skills were determined based on five designated questions from the autism diagnostic interview revised (ADI R) questionnaire. CNVs  data were retrieved from a genome wide analysis of CNVs in these children. Results: Savant skills were significantly more prevalent in our sample than in other children with ASD in the SSC cohort (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Child   ren with savant skills had, on average, a higher IQ (93.0ÃÂ±24.2 vs. 79.1ÃÂ±25.5; P<0.001), and a larger head circumference (HC) (54.3ÃÂ±2.55 vs. 53.8ÃÂ±2.60; P , 0.003).

752, Copy number variation in 19 Italian multiplex families with autism spectrum disorder: importance of synaptic and neurite elongation genes,P09.028,,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is endowed with impressive heritability estima tes and high recurrence rates. Its genetic underpinnings are very heteroge neous and include many common and rare variants located in hundreds of different loci, each characterized by variable levels of penetrance. Multiplex families from single ethnic groups represent a useful means to reduce hete rogeneity and enhance genetic load. We screened 19 Italian ASD multiplex families (3 triplets and 16 duplets, total N,41 ASD subjects), using array CGH (Agilent 180K). Certainly or probably causal CNVs, defined Ã¢ÂÂclinical   ly relevant CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ, were detected in 17/41 (41%) of ASD probands, corre sponding to 9/19 (47%) multiplex families with at least one affected sibling genetically positive. However only in 3/9 (33%) of these families, siblings share the same causal or highly causal CNV. Additional potentially relevant CNVs not shared by affected sib pairs were detected also in these three fa milies. 45 genes are located on the Ã¢ÂÂclinically relevantÃ¢ÂÂ CNVs. Through an enrichment analysis, we found that 9/45 (20%) of these genes appear pri marily involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation/management. Our results highlight the importance of synaptic and neurite elongation ge nes in the pathogenesis of autism, despite genetic heterogeneity in ASD even within multiplex families belonging to a single ethnic group.

753, Increased frequency of the autism broader phenotype in mothers transmitting etiological CNVs to sons affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),P09.029,,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder with a high male to female ratio. An increased prevalence of autism like perso   nality traits is found in unaffected relatives of ASD children, suggesting a genetic liability of a broader autism phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that the parents of ASD children who transmit etiological CNVs might exhi bit ASD traits more frequently than non transmitting parents. To test this hypothesis, we analysed CNV inheritance and parental behavioral traits in families from the Autism Genome Project, assessed using the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) (N,341) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (N,456). We selected CNVs spanning well established candidate genes for ASD, and compared transmitting and non transmitting parental test scores using a t test corrected for multiple testing by the Group Benja   mini Hochberg Procedure. Overall, CNV transmitting parents did not differ significantly in BAPQ and  SRS scores from non transmitting parents. However, independent analyses of relative pairs revealed a significant difference in BAPQ global (t, 2.18; ad  justed P,.032), BAPQ aloofness domain (t, 2.61; adjusted P,.032) and SRS  scores (t, 2.03; adjusted P,.047) between mothers transmitting and mo thers not transmitting etiological CNVs to their affected sons. Our findings  indicate that mothers presenting personality traits in the broader autism  phenotype are frequently carriers of pathogenic CNVs that they transmit to their ASD sons. The results from the analyses of maternal phenotype and CNV transmission patterns to sons support previous reports of maternal  transmission bias to male offspring, and the prevalent hypothesis of a high  er genetic risk tolerance in females due to putative protective factors.

754, AUTS2 syndrome: Further delineation of the phenotype in a 68 years old female,P09.030,,"Introduction: Genetic evaluation of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, with technical improvements in array based technologies and se   quencing, has yielded an abundance of new candidate genes for intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and developmental delay. We report a 68 year old female with mild moderate intellectual disability, behavioral findings suggesting ASD, developmental delay and dysmorphic features. The SNP array analysis demonstrated a 257 kb deletion comprising exon 6 of AUTS2 gene.Case Report: The patient was born at term as the first child of an unrela   ted couple following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Mild motor and significant speech delay were evident during childhood. On her physical examination at age 68, she had short stature, microcephaly and abdominal obesity. Mild facial findings and micrognathia were noted. She was followed for scoliosis since early adulthood. Orthopedic findings were present. Her intellectual disability was mild to moderate with behavioral problems. She was noted to be a very friendly, active and girly person. She had limited eye contact, hyperverbality with limited vocabulary of 40 50 words. She had tics and obsessions, skin pricking, hyperorality and sound sensitivity. She was not schooled but her family made sure that she was involved in daily activities.Conclusions: This clinical report provides the natural history in the eldest patients yet to be reported and complements the existing evidence sugge sting that disruption of the AUTS2 gene leads to a recently delineated neu rodevelopmental phenotype with a wide spectrum, namely Ã¢ÂÂ AUTS2 Syndro meÃ¢ÂÂ.",2016.0,,"E.

763, Copy number variations in psychiatric patients with intellectual disability and catatonia: an exploratory study,P09.040,,"Introduction: Catatonia is a motor dysregulation syndrome co occurring with a variety of psychiatric and somatic disorders. The good response to  treatment with benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy indicates a  neurobiological background. Environmental factors as well as genetic fac tors play a role in the etiopathogenesis. Research on the genetic aetiology  is limited. We hypothesize that copy number variations known to be risks  factors for neurodevelopmental disorders may play a role in the aetiology of catatonia. The aim of this study is to describe the CNVs in a population of psychiatric patients with an intellectual disability and catatonia. Methods:  Fifteen intellectually disabled adults admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit  and diagnosed with catatonia were selected for genetic examination. Me dical files were analysed retrospectively to collect data on cognitive func  tioning and psychiatric diagnosis. A clinical genetic examination was per  formed. Blood samples were taken for molecular karyotyping (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation). Results: CNVs, including 5 duplications and 3 dele  tions, were detected in 8 of the 15 patients (53%). In 2 of these patients a  microdeletion including SHANK3 was found. Psychiatric diagnoses in these patients are autism, psychotic and affective disorders. Intellectual disability ranged from borderline to severe disability. Conclusion: CNVs occurred in  half of intellectually disabled psychiatric adults with catatonia. These fin  dings suggest that SHANK3del may play a role in the aetiology of catatonia  in intellectually disabled patients. Cognitive functioning ranged from bor derline to severe intellectual disability.

765, Autism related gene expression is spatially restricted in mid gestation human fetal cerebellum,P09.042,,"Introduction: Cerebellar dysfunction has a large impact on both cognitive and motor behavior and mounting evidence implicates the cerebellum in  autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the impact of ASD genes on ce  rebellar development and function is largely unknown. Here, we defined the 15 post conception week (pcw) human fetal cerebellar transcriptome and  hypothesized that ASD genes have neuron type specific expression. Materials and Methods: Laser capture microdissection (LCM) of intact cerebella from two 15 pcw fetuses enabled isolation of Purkinje cell (PC) and granule cell (GC) progenitor neurons. High quality RNA was isolated  (RIN>8), sequencing libraries using TruSeq RNA Access kit were construc  ted, barcoded, and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000. Paired end reads were aligned to the human genome HG19 using Tophat2, genes and  counts were summarized using HTSeq. Gene level differential expression  was analyzed using DESeq2.Results: On average, RNA seq generated 18 million high quality reads per  sample, 96% of which mapped uniquely. Hierarchical clustering using the  most variable genes within the dataset distinguished LCM isolated PC and GC samples, including several known PC  or GC specific genes. ASD genes generated from exome sequencing studies were expressed either throug  hout the cerebellum or restricted to PC neurons. Conclusions: LCM is an effective method to enrich for developing PC and GC neurons in human fetal cerebellum. ASD genes are expressed throughout  mid gestation cerebellum or restricted to PC neurons, further substantia   ting cerebellar neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in ASD, and  providing a potential neuronal therapeutic target.

768, Case report: exome sequencing of a family with childhood disintegrative disorder,P09.045,,"Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is a very rare but devastating neu rodevelopmental condition characterised by rapid and severe decline in developmental skills (communication, play, self care, cognition) in children with apparently normal previous development for the first 2 years of life. The regression results in significant long term impairments in social com munication skills, similar to features of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with severe intellectual disability. Extensive neurometabolic investigations usually do not reveal an underlying aetiology. We report an exome sequen   cing study of a family with two affected children and neurotypical parents. Pathway analyses of rare and potentially damaging variants highlighted two variants in genes involved in intracellular trafficking and recruitment of pro teins to the centrosome: both children carry a maternal stop codon in PCM1 (NP_006188, p.E1912X) and a paternal nonsynonymous change in ALMS1 (NP_055935, p.S763N). PCM1 is an essential component of the centriolar satellites and interacts with several proteins, including DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) and BBS4 (Bardet Biedl Syndrome 4). Mutations in ALMS1 can cause AlstrÃÂ¶m Syndrome, a rare recessive multi system ciliopathy, clo sely related to the Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS). The biological functions of ALMS1 are still being elucidated, but roles in cilium function and mainte nance, intracellular trafficking, signaling pathways and cell cycle regulation have been suggested. Although the functional interaction between ALMS1 and PCM1 needs to be further investigated, the participation of the two pro teins to the same cellular network, which has been previously implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders, led us to hypothesize a possible com pound effect of the two identified variants.",2016.0,,"F.

769, Structural chromosome 21 specific instability in the diseased brain,P09.046,," Introduction. Chromosome 21 aneuploidy has been shown to affect the di  seased brain especially in individuals with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD). Howe  ver, structural chromosome 21 specific instability has never been a target  for molecular (neuro)cytogenetic studies of the diseased brain. Here, we have addressed chromosome 21 structural variations in single cells of the  AD, schizophrenia and autism brain as well as in the unaffected brain. Materials and Methods. Ten AD, 18 schizophrenia, 12 autism and 20 age  and sex matched samples of the postmortem brain (frontal cortex, Brod   mann area 10) were studied by interphase chromosome specific multicolor  banding (ICS MCB) and NeuN  immunohistochemistry. Results. We were able to show that rare recurrent rearrangements of chro mosome 21 or structural chromosome 21 specific instabilities are found al   most exclusively in the AD brain. These were isochromosomes 21q, 21q22 >qter losses and chromosome 21 breaks at 21q21 and 21q22 affecting 0.6 3.7% of cells. NeuN immunohistochemistry has indicated that the instability  randomly affects NeuN positive and NeuN negative cell nuclei in contrast to  chromosome 21 breaks, which were more prevalent in NeuN positive cell  nuclei.Conclusions. Our data suggests that chromosome 21 specific instability is able to contribute to the AD pathogenesis. One can hypothesize chromoso   me 21 breaks confined to NeuN positive cells of the AD brain to result from the dysregulation of DNA replication/reparation or DNA damage response pathways.

781, Targeted gene testing of 50 patients with epilepsy related neurodevelopmental disorder,P09.059,,"Background: Epilepsy is a common clinical and genetic heterogeneous neu rological disorder, with a large number of cases caused by genetic factors. To understand the molecular basis of epilepsy, 141 genes associated to neuro metabolic disorders, syndromic and non syndromic epilepsy were routinely analysed on 50 cases.Methods: Genomic libraries were generated using the Ion AmpliSeqTM Exo me RDY as exome backbone, combined with an AmpliSeq panel design to improve gene coverage. Sequencing reads generated on the Ion ProtonTM and Ion S5TM platform were analyzed using Torrent Suite software. Annota   ted variants using ION Reporter were prioritized with an in house analytical pipeline to identify the causative variants. This approach assures an average depth of 100X and an average 98.3% coverage in the selected genes.Results: Among the 50 probands analyzed, 22 (44%) were referred as Ear ly Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathies (EEIE). This approach allowed us to identify potentially genetic causative variants on 40% of the cases. Among EEIE patients 64% (14/22) were genetically diagnosed. Out of the 63 iden  tified variants, 26 were associated to a gene with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, 5 of which were confirmed as Ã¢ÂÂde novoÃ¢ÂÂ. Furthermore, a  combined analysis of genes related to other neurodevelopmental disorders  as autism was performed on 8 cases.Conclusions: Epilepsy panels based on WES provide a cost effective and comprehensive strategy, that accelerates the identification of a definitive  clinical diagnosis, decreasing the familial anxiety, improving the prognosis  accuracy and facilitating the therapy selection.",2016.0,,"M.

795, Social anxiety and autism spectrum traits among adult FMR1 premutation carriers,P09.076,," Introduction: Behavioral symptoms and traits have been proposed as early markers in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim was of this study was to evaluate social anxiety and autism in FMR1 premutation carriers and con trols using the Social Phobia Inventory and the Autism Spectrum Quotient.Material and Methods: Fifty nine premutation carriers (40 females; 19 ma les) (7 females and 9 males with FXTAS) were compared to 50 controls (32 females; 18 males).Results: Our results show that FMR1 premutation carriers have higher so   cial anxiety scores and autistic traits compared to controls. Indeed, the SPIN scores were higher increased in women FMR1 premutation carriers compa red to men whereas the AQ scores were similar between the two genders. Finally, SPIN scores were correlated with the repeat size when the CGG num ber was greater than 100.Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that social anxiety is greater in FMR1 premutation carrier women than in controls but not in men. In addi   tion, both men and women with the FMR1 premutation have an increased risk of autism traits. Our results suggest that a wide range of behavioral/psychiatric traits should be included within the Fragile X Spectrum disorder and that the penetrance of these traits depends on the genetic background (CGG repeat number, gene modifiers, epigenetic, among others) as well as on gender.Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the Instituto de Salud Car   los III (ISCIII; PI12/00879), cofinanced by the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional Ã¢ÂÂuna manera de hacer EuropaÃ¢ÂÂ and AGAUR from the Autonomous Catalan Government (2014 SGR603).ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  195Back to index",2016.0,,"M.

Background: Deletions or mutations of neurexin 1 (NRXN1) remain a dif   ficult counselling issue because of reduced penetrance and variable expres   sivity. We have reviewed 33 families known to our center to estimate pen etrance and document the phenotype.Method: Cases were identified by database review within our center or through collaboration with colleagues. Genomic data, clinical phenotype & family history information was extracted and analyzed. Penetrance was calculated using the method proposed by Kirov et al, 2014. The unaffected carriers were used as controls.Results: We identified 53 NRXN1 deletion carriers and one individual with a point mutation of whom 37(69%) had a definite phenotype. 33 were pro bands and the rest were first degree relatives. 87% of probands were in vestigated because of unexplained developmental delay mostly speech and language or learning difficulties and 63% had Autism. 17/53 were intronic deletions. The overall penetrance was ~66% for any phenotype and 40% for Autism. Congenital anomalies were reported in 7 infants and seizures in 6. Conclusion: Our data suggest that neurexin 1 deletions present with a vari able phenotype and are not fully penetrant. Intronic deletions are patho genic .Whilst, a parent that carries the deletion has a 50% risk of passing it on, the risk of a child with the deletion developing Autism is approximately 40%.Genetic counselling remains problematic as the additional factors that trig ger the phenotype are unclear and impossible to predict.

Introduction.Genomic alterations to molecular pathways influence intellec  tual functioning.However, psychological consequences of genomic changes  remain largely obscure. To get further insights into the emerging field of ge  nomic psychology, new tools for correlating genomic and psychological data appear to be required. Here we propose an approach combining psycholo  gical evaluation using International Classification of Functioning (ICF   CY),  chromosomal microarray and original bioinformatic approach for network   based classification. Materials and methods.To test the approach, we studied 7 children (1 6  years) with varying degrees of intellectual disability, autism and congenital malformations. From the ICF   CY, we focused on general mental functions,  communication and involvement. Results.Three cases demonstrated copy number variations and losses of  heterozygosity spanning genes involved in metabolic pathways (KEGG: hsa01100): PON1, PON2, PON3, UROC1,UGT1A8, UGT1A10. Bioinformatic analysis showed these genomic and epigenomic variations to underlie phe  notypic features. Application of ICF   CY showed that all children had little to  no phrasal speech (d1331), troubles maintaining cyclic interaction with a  person (d3503) and about 50% success in responding to complex requests  (more than 3 parameters) (d3102). All children were engaging in symbolic  play and shared activities with adults. ÃÂ¡onclusions. The correlation between psychological and genomic data can shed light on molecular pathways to brain malfunctioning. Here, we de   monstrated that an opportunity to obtain such correlation combining ge  nomic, bioinformatic and psychological methodology does exist. In order to  confirm the found typical features and the effectiveness of the approach it  should be applied towards a larger cohort.

The clinical picture is largely opposite to that of Sotos syndrome (macrocephaly, overgrowth and advanced bone age). The dosage effect of NSD1 (5q35) is suggested to be the cause of the main clinical problems.We report a dysmorphic newborn with IUGR, microcephaly, short stature, and prenatally diagnosed congenital heart defect (ASD, VSD, left ventricle  hypoplasia). First routine karyotype analysis (GTG banding) revealed a nor   mal male karyotype. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA, HumanCytoS  NP 12 BeadChip, Illumina Inc.) revealed a ~8.3 Mb duplication of 5q35.1  qter. To localize the extra copy, FISH analysis was done with Kreatech  hTERT/NSD1 and 5p/5q subtelomeric probes. Surprisingly, two additional signals of NSD1 and 5qter were seen, located on a small additional marker  chromosome, which was present in ~10% of metaphases (all of them were  of bad band quality and so escaped in first analysis), and in 50% of inter   phase nuclei.The mosaic tetrasomy due to the presence of der(5q) marker chromosome  in ~50% of cells results in a typical duplication picture seen in CMA as well  as in clinical features typical for 5q35 duplication.

948, Clinical features and mutation spectrum of Coffin Siris syndrome in Malaysia: A case series,P11.035,,"Introduction: Coffin Siris syndrome(CSS) is a rare disorder characterised by intellectual disability, distinctive facies, hypoplastic/aplastic 5 th finger   nails and/or toenails and growth retardation. Pathogenic variants in ARI D1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SMARCE1 of the SWI/SNF complex are known to cause CSS.Method: Between January 2013 and July 2015, 17 patients with clinical dia gnosis of CSS underwent whole exome sequencing(WES) in search of the SWI/SNF complex genes.Results: We report 12 individuals (5 males,7 females) with molecular confir   mation. All had developmental delay, dysmorphism with coarse facies, thick lower lips, hirsutism and hypoplastic nails. Five patients had microcephaly; 8 had failure to thrive; 9 had short stature; 2 had secundum ASD. Cases with non typical features would also be highlighted. WES identified heterozy   gous mutations in ARID1B in 10 probands, and in SMARCB1 in 1 patient. Interestingly, a boy with features more in keeping with CSS had a mutati   on in SMARCA2, the gene associated with Nicolaides Baraitser syndrome, highlighting the many similarities of these two syndromes. All were novel mutations. Seven were de novo, one child was adopted, four others have yet to be determined. The ARID1B mutations included 4 frameshift insertions, 3 frameshift deletions, 2 nonsense mutations and 1 splice site mutation. The SMARCB1 and SMARCA2 mutations were missense mutations. The child with SMARCB1 seemed the worst affected with severe growth retardation and cognitive impairment.Conclusions: Mutations in ARID1B are the predominant cause for CSS in Ma   laysia. Due to overlapping phenotypes with Nicolaides Baraitser syndrome and chromosomal abnormalities, molecular confirmation directs accurate genetic counselling and expands the phenotypic spectrum.ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.ESHG.ORG  231Back to index",2016.0,,"W.

1259, Does the genomic architecture amongst Irish Travellers predispose to chromosome 17q12 microduplication?,P13.11,,"Certain regions of the human genome are predisposed to non allelic homo   logous recombination (NAHR) resulting in copy number variants (CNVs). Ethnic differences have been observed with some CNVs. We previously re ported a consanguineous Irish Traveller family with PCD and laterality due to homozygous mutations in CCDC103 (17q21.31). The mother (patient A) and affected children had a co existing chromosome 17q12 duplication. The 17q12 duplication and CCDC103 mutation are in cis, ~6Mb apart. Patient AÃ¢ÂÂs husband (her first cousin) does not carry the 17q12 duplication indica ting that a) this was a recent evolutionary CNV event either in patient A or her mother (husbandÃ¢ÂÂs maternal aunt) or b) there has been a recent recom   bination event.We now report a second Irish Traveller family with a 17q12 duplicati   on, identical to the first. This child (who has autism) also has a de novo neurexin 1 deletion (2q13.1). The families are not related and come from different geographical areas. Further analysis revealed that family 2 do not carry the CCDC103 mutation suggesting that a) the duplication arose as an independent de novo event in family 2 or b) recombination has separated the CCDC103 mutation from the duplication in previous generations.A review of 17q12 duplications identified within our centre revealed only three other cases, all in non Traveller families.Conclusions: The Irish Traveller population number ~40,000, out of a total population of 4.6 million, within the Irish Republic. Our discovery of two  unrelated Irish Traveller families with a 17q12 duplication suggests that  the genomic architecture at 17q12 in this population may predispose to this CNV.",2016.0,,"S. A.

The array CGH analysis identified complex chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 (Case 1), 12 (Case 2) and 1 and 4 (Case 3). Case 1 presented a complex clinical phenotype in which coexisted 3 known dis   orders: Potocki Lupski syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease and neu rofibromatosis type 1.

Case 3 exhibited a complex clinical picture, not im mediately framed with 1p36 deletion syndrome (array CGH revealed a 3  Mb deletion in 1p36). With whole genome sequencing we investigated the  genetic architecture of these constitutional complex chromosomal rearran  gements (CCRs),copy number profiling, and breakpoint junctions proving  that the rearrangements (deletions/duplications/inversions) identified in our cases were not clustered on a single chromosome region, but on the  whole length of the chromosomes.

1295, The use of automated facial analysis in the clinical diagnostic of autism spectrum disorders (ASD),P14.005,,"Introduction: Autism can be part of a genetic syndrome associating with dysmorphic features. While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals.Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology  (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con  trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor   phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in  some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial  dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from  the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa  rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver  Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis   order 1 were identified.

However, current CNV calling algorithms have a high false positi ve rate for small CNVs and experimental validation using qPCR or custom arrays is labor intensive and expensive. Therefore, this study looks at the possibilities of an in silico validation approach to distinguish between true  and false positive CNV calls smaller than 100 kb resulting from existing CNV calling algorithms.Materials and Methods: The study sample contains 646 individuals (159 fathers, 157 mothers and 330 children) from 159 families with non syndro mic autism spectrum disorders. All family members were genotyped using the Illumina Human Omni2.5 8v1 SNP array and CNV calls were made using CNV WebStore.

1426, An integrative analysis of genomic studies for the identification of the molecular network regions associated with autism spectrum disorders,P16.03,,"Introduction: Molecular interaction networks are crucial for the interpreta  tion of genome wide data of pathologies characterized by a marked genetic heterogeneity like Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Indeed biological functions involved in a specific pathology are likely to be more conserved than individual genetic variations. We define the network regions enriched  in genetic variations associated with ASDs. Compared with previous studies,  we consider several reported evidences and the whole network topology to predict relevant interacting partners of ASDs genes.Materials and Methods: Lists of genes associated with ASDs were collected  from a manually curated database and genomic studies. A diffusion based  method was used to identify genes in network proximity to those from the  lists. Direct and indirect protein protein interactions were collected from five different databases. The Italian cohort (195 cases and 87 controls) was genotyped with a high density platform. Results: We defined genome wide scores summarizing the proximity of  each gene to the gene lists associated to ASDs. We highlighted the network  regions, with corresponding biological functions, differently represented in the considered genomic studies. We found significant number of genes in network proximity to genes associated with ASDs among the genes reported  in the literature as having a minimal evidence of association with ASDs and  the genes containing alleles associated with ASDs in our Italian cohort. Conclusions: We summarise the network regions densely populated by ASDs associated genes providing a network based tool to quantify the func tional relation of novel genes with those already associated with ASDs.

1543, Sapiens specific genetic changes affecting oxytocin pathways,P17.41,,"Introduction: A growing literature suggests that oxytocin pathways (oxt + receptors) must have played a key role in the emergence of human sociality and communication. We wish to provide genetic evidence for this by exploi   ting recent discoveries in the domain of archaic human genomics.Materials and Methods: We have relied on robust findings in the genetic foundations of language (FOXP2 CNTNAP2 pathway), an extensive database oxytocin related search (Pubmed), predictive protein interaction program (String 10), and results from archaic human genomics.Results: We put forth a sapiens specific change (compared to archaic hu mans) affecting the functional connection between OXT , POU3F2, FOXP2, YY1, and CNTNAP2. POU3F2 is known to be necessary for oxytocin cell diffe rentiation. Crucially, a DNase I hypersensitive site accelerated in the human lineage on Chromosome 6 lies in a gene desert 300 kb from POU3F2, which regulates FOXP2 in a sapiens unique manner. Two of the substitutions in this site strengthen a putative YY1 transcription factor binding site. YY1 has been implicated in one of the variants of the CNTNAP2 5Ã¢ÂÂ promoter as risk factors for autism spectrum disorders. YY1 is among the top 10 enriched transcription factors in differentially methylated regions in sapiens vs. ar chaic humans. YY1 binds in a methylation sensitive fashion to an insulator sequence within Peg3. Peg3 knockouts show reduced hypothalamic oxyto cin neurons.Conclusion: We suggest that all these oxytocin related changes are linked and could underlie cognitive and behavioral differences at the heart of our communicative abilities, and open up new avenues in the field of behavioral endocrinology.",2016.0,,"C.

1718, Parent Perspectives on Whole Genome Sequencing for Autism Spectrum Disorder,P20.25,,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditi   ons that have a complex genetic etiology. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful ASD research tool since it can assay many types of genetic va riation in a single test. In recent years, there has been a lot of debate around return of results following genetic testing; however, there is a paucity of em pirical data on research subjectÃ¢ÂÂs experience with WGS, in particular. To eli cit and analyze participantsÃ¢ÂÂ experiences with WGS, we invited parents (and capable children) who were enrolled in an ASD genomic study to participate in semi structured interviews at two times during the WGS testing cycle: 1) following informed consent, and 2) following return of results. To date, we have interviewed 19 parents at time 1 and 8 parents at time 2. Emerging themes from time 1 interviews include, hope for a genetic diagnosis, hope for treatment, and altruism. Parents also hoped for findings that they could use for planning and prevention purposes, although they expressed con cerns over inflicted insight and insurance discrimination. Following return of results at time 2, emerging themes include, the value of learning genetic information, the resolution of blame between biological parents, and dis   appointment at not receiving treatment guiding information. Our findings suggest that participants may have different motivations/concerns before and after testing; whereas many begin with altruistic motivations, their desire for actionable results weighs heavily post testing.

1849, Microdeletion of 10q21,P08.03,,"Introduction: We described the case of a 9 year old boy with a de novo 10q21.3 q22.1 microdeletion, intellectual disability (ID), attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, mucocutaneous pigmentation, and juvenile colon  polyposis (JCP). Methods and Results: Cytogenetic analyses in the proband and her parents was normal; Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) by CytoScan Optima in the patient revealed a deletion of about 4.41 Mb ([hg19] chr10:68,299,927 72,715,960), while CMA of parental DNA was normal. Although no similar size deletions were reported in DECIPHER databa   se, there are several patients with much smaller pure deletions (86.05 to 378.77 Kb) that clustered at CTNNA3 gene (chr10:68,165,545 69,222,108). The most remarkable common feature of these cases was intellectual disa   bility, global developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, the analysis of the gene content of the deleted region showed 40 MIM genes; of which only four have been implicated in autosomal dominant diseases. Our patient does not exhibit any clinical data of those conditions. In or   der to identify that genes could be involved in the phenotype, we analyzed physiologic roles, functional interactions, and also which those are dosage sensitive. The results pointed to CTNNA3 (607667), LRRTM3 (610869) and SIRT1 (604479); all located in 10q21.3, as best candidates. Thus, these three genes may either individually or in combination be responsible for ID with JCP seen in our patient. Conclusions: To the best knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo 10q21.3 q22.1 deletion. This case suggests a novel geno mic disorder at 10q21.3 region associated to ID with JCP .

1854, Implementation of aCGH assessment in genetic diagnostic of patient with global development delay/intellectual disability or multiple congenital anomalies Romanian experience,P08.08,,"Introduction: Assessment of DNA copy number through array CGH repre sent a powerful diagnostic tool for clinicians. Genomic microarrays are used as first tier genetic tests in postnatal assessment of subjects diagnosed with unexplained global development delay (GDD)/ intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) in almost all West European countries. Two years ago, we started to imple ment in South West Romania the postnatal aCGH assessment of individuals with unexplained GDD/ID or CMA.Materials and methods: We assessed 30 patients diagnosed with unex   plained GDD/ID or CMA. Conventional cytogenetic evaluation did not de   tect any chromosomal imbalance that could be associated with the clinical phenotype of the patients. DNA isolated and purified from peripheral blood was examined for copy number variations (CNVs) using Roche NimbleGen 3x720K/12x135K or Agilent 4x180K/ 8x60K ISCA design oligonucleotide microarray. Copy number data was analyzed with Nexus 6.1 software (Ne   xus BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA).Results: aCGH assessment identified in several patients submicroscopic changes (microdeletions or microduplications) that could partially explain the clinical phenotype.Conclusion: This study demonstrated the utility and importance of genetic testing through aCGH in the management and counseling of patients with unexplained GDD/ID or CMA and their families.

1858, Interstitial deletion of 5q35,P08.13,,"We report on a 15 years old boy, first child of healthy, non consanguineous  parents. During pregnancy, a ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal  defect (ASD) and an omphalocele were diagnosed. At the time of presen   tation, he demonstrated global developmental delay and unspecific facial  dysmorphism. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed an apparently normal male karyotype (46,XY; GTG banding at 550 band level). Array CGH analysis (Agilent 400k microarray set) uncovered a de novo deletion of 1.6  Mb in the chromosomal region 5q35.1 q35.2. This deletion was confirmed  by FISH analysis. The deletion comprises 11 genes including the NKX2 5 gene (OMIM 600584). Mutations in the NKX2 5 gene were identified in patients with ASD, VSD, tetralogy of Fallot, and other congenital cardiac defects. The de   letion does not overlap with the minimal Sotos syndrome deletion region.To the best of our knowledge, there are only two reports on patients with small deletions in 5q35.1 q35.2 including the NKX2 5 gene. One patient was described with severe heart defect, microcephaly, minor facial dys morphic features, scoliosis, cryptorchidism, learning difficulties associated with ADHD and an IQ of 83. He carried a 2.2 Mb deletion in 5q35.1 q35.2 (Baekvad Hansen et al., 2006).

1861," Patient with language impairment, intellectual disability, autism and de novo truncating FOXP1 variant helps to define emerging somatic phenotype associated with FOXP1 defects",P08.16,,"FOXP1 (forkhead box protein P1) is a transcription factor important in neu rodevelopment. Thirteen patients with de novo protein disrupting intrage  nic FOXP1 variants have been reported. They have language impairment,  developmental delay/intellectual disability (ID) and autistic features. We report an 8 year old boy with severe language impairment, moderate ID and atypical autism. His speech regressed at 18 months of age and started to improve again since 5 years of age. However, expressive speech is severely affected and shows no progress. The boy is hyperactive and anxious. Other features include hypotonia, mild facial dysmorphism, hypermetropia and strabismus.Karyotyping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Targeted next ge   neration sequencing using the TruSight Autism panel (Illumina) identified a private heterozygous nonsense FOXP1 mutation (NM_032682.5:c.1319C>G,p. S440*), which was confirmed using Sanger sequencing in the patient but in neither of his parents indicating its de novo nature. The aberrant transcript is likely removed by nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and FOXP1 haploin  sufficiency was proposed as the main pathogenic mechanism. If the tran script escaped NMD, the p.S440* mutation would truncate FOXP1 between the leucine zipper dimerization domain and the FOX DNA binding domain. A recently functionally characterized neighbouring FOXP1 variant p.Y439* showed aberrant protein localization.Our patient supports the role of FOXP1 in language, cognition and behaviour,  and helps to define the emerging characteristic somatic phenotype of FOXP1  mutation carriers which may include prominent forehead, frontal hair ups weep, arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, low set ears, short nose with a broad tip and smooth philtrum.Supported by NT/14200, 00064203, CZ.2.16/3.1.00/24022 and NF CZ11 PDP 3 003 2014.

The use of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) tech   nology in clinical practice increases the detection rate of causative genetic imbalances in approximately 15% of patients with ID of unknown cause. Due to the simplicity and flexibility of the performance multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) is a method of choice for detection of known microdeletions/ microduplications in less developed countries.We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of MLPA technique for identifica   tion of microdeletion/microduplication syndromes among patients with ID. A total of 120 patients with various degrees of ID, autism and/or different dysmorphic features were included in the study. MLPA kit P245 was used in all patients, while P371 4 were used in patients with specific aberrations.MLPA revealed chromosomal imbalances in 15 out of 120 patients (12.5%). Some imbalances were associated with well described syndromes: Wolf Hirschorn Syndrome or 4p16.3del. (n,2), and Prader Willi/Angelman or 15q11.2 q13.1del. (n,3). Other patients harbored uncommon chromoso   mal imbalances: 1p36.3 deletion, 3q29 deletion, 9q22 deletion, 15q13.2 13.3 duplication, 15q24.1 deletion, 17p11.2 deletion, 17p11.2 duplication, 17q21.31 deletion and 22q11.21 duplication.

1870, Detection of small SHANK3 deletions in patients with delayed speech and developmental delay using Array CGH,P08.29,,"IntroductionThe 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, also known as Phelan McDermid syndro me (PMS), is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide range of deletion sizes (100 Kb to 9 Mb), and a great phenotypic variability. Most neurologi cal features are thought to be caused by haploinsuficiency of SHANK3 gene, which encodes for a core scaffolding protein at the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. The present study aimed to detect deletions affec ting only to the SHANK3 gene (<100 Kb) so that a better genotype pheno type correlation can be achieved in patients with PMS.Materials and MethodsArray CGH including 15kb resolution for SHANK3 gene (KaryoNIMÃÂ® Au tism 180K array CGH, designed by NIMGeneticsÃÂ®) has been used for ana   lyzing patients suspected to bear PMS. Data analysis was done using hg19 genomic build and ADM 2 statistic (set as 6).ResultsWe identified 8 individuals with 22q13.33 deletions, but only three of them were selected since they harboured pure SHANK3 deletions. Specifically, pa tient 1 and 2 showed a 50 60 Kb deletion affecting exons 10 to 23 and 4 to 23, respectively. On the other hand, patient 3 showed the smallest deletion, being 23 Kb sized and affecting exons 8 to 17. The three patients were dia gnosed with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability. In addition, patient 1 and 3 also showed autism spectrum disorder.ConclusionsThese results supports haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene, which en codes for a structural protein of the postsynaptic density, as a major cau sative factor in the neurological symptoms observed in Phelan McDermid syndrome.

This condition is clinically heterogenejous with complex etiopa thogenesis which can be conceptualized as a dynamic interplay between environment cues and predisposing genetic factors. Recent studies have reported that variants of the CNTNAP2 gene are associated both with lan   guage deficits and language delays in autism. So CNTNAP2 is considered as a strong candidate for the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

Genomic DNA was extracted from oral swab samples of 117 cases and 123 controls and SNP genotypes were determined. The Taqman ÃÂ®Real Time PCR and genotyping assay were utilized to deter   mine the genotypes. Results and Conclusion: None of the SNPs (rs2710102 and rs759178) within CNTNAP2  tested are associated significantly with  ASD.

CHRNA7  is included in the smallest region of overlap of the 15q13.3  deletions and duplications, a hotspot for Copy number variants (CNVs) due to the presence of segmental duplications, favoring non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) occurrence. Heterozygous or homozygous deletions are usually associated with a neurodevelopmental phenotype of high pene  trance. Case Report: Using exome sequencing after negative extensive genetic work up in a 13 year old Caucasian boy presenting with ASD, intellectual disabili  ty and developmental delay, with no facial dysmorphism or malformations,  and normal growth, we identified two heterozygous missense mutations in the CHRNA7  gene.

1891, DNA Repair Gene Variants and The Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder,P09.19,,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder, and its extreme heterogeneity further complicates our understanding of its biology. Epidemiological evidence from family and twin studies supports a strong genetic component in ASD etiology. Oxidative stress and abnormal DNA me thylation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. Brain tissues from ASD cases showed higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers than healthy controls in postmortem analysis. Association between oxidative stress and DNA damage has been well known. Thus, we sought to investiga te a potential link between DNA repair genes and ASD and analyze the role of XPD Asp312Asn and XRCC4 G 1394T gene polymorphisms for ASD in the Turkish population.Material and Methods: Genotyping was conducted by PCR RFLP based on 100 patients and 96 unrelated healthy controls.Results: We, for the first time, demonstrated a positive association between XRCC4 gene variants and ASD risk. Frequencies of XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotypes were higher in patients (%34) than the controls (%18.7). The statistical analysis revealed that the individuals who had XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotype had an increased risk for ASD (OR , 2.23, 95% CI , 1.10 4.55). However, no significant association was found for XPD Asp312Asn polymorphism with the risk of ASD.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that XRCC4 G 1394T polymorphism might be associated with ASD pathogenesis.

1902, Genetics of language deficits in schizophrenia and autism: an evolutionary approach,P09.38,,"Both autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are highly prevalent cognitive disorders, entailing language deficits. Recent advances in genome wide technologies have provided with a long list of candidate genes for SZ and ASD, but the gap between genes, the pathophysiology of SZ and ASD, and their distinctive cognitive and linguistic profiles still remains open. Our study aims to bridge this gap through an evo devo approach that focuses on how language evolved in the species and that construes both con ditions as poles of a continuum of modes of cognition, also encompassing typically developing cognition. To this aim, we have performed literature mining and network analysis of known candidate genes for SZ and ASD and found that they are overrepresented among the gene believed to be impor   tant for the evolution of the human faculty of language. Many of these genes are common risk factors for both conditions. Additionally, we performed in silico data mining of previously published SZ and ASD microarray data   sets and found that many of these genes important for language evolution (like CNTNAP2, DLX5, FOXP1, or ROBO2) are differentially expressed in the brains of schizophrenics and autists. We will conclude that the (substanti   ally opposite) linguistic (dys)abilities seen in SZ and ASD patients may re present abnormal (but still related) ontogenetic itineraries for the human faculty of language and that the same factors that prompted the transition from an ape like cognition to a human specific cognition may explain the high prevalence of SZ and ASD, but also their related cognitive profiles.Grant: FFI2014 61888 EXP E",2016.0,,"A.

To identify targets for new therapies, a through understanding of the genetic lesions contributing to establishment of the leukemic clone and resistance to therapy is required. The goals of the study were to provide an explanation for the observed diffe rences in outcome among patients who relapse early and to define high risk patients much better.Materials and Methods: We examined gene expression profiles in 20 child hood B cell ALL and healthy B cell subsets by using Ã¢ÂÂIllumina HumanHT 12 v4 Expression BeadChipÃ¢ÂÂ technology. According to the differential analysis, selected eight genes had been validated in a larger B ALL cohort (n,81 pati   ents) by using Quantitative Real Time PCR.Results and Conclusions: Diagnose patients who had relapse showed diffe rential expression in cell cycle, apoptosis, purine/pyrimidine metabolism, and different cancer pathways. Many of these pathways have been implica   ted in tumorgenesis previously and are attractive targets for intervention strategies. After the validation process, aberrant PMAIP1 and RASD1 ex   pression had been linked with relapsed. PMAIP1 is related with ERK Signa ling and apoptosis, RASD1 is related with MAPK targets.

2140, Genetic counselling in idiopathic autism: parental knowledge and perspectivesM,EMP1.22,," Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most inheritable neurodevelopmental disorders, but the aetiology remains unknown in 
the majority of cases. Therefore, most parents must base their reproductive 
decisions on empiric recurrence risk (RR) estimates. To determine factors 
influencing family planning and benefits of genetic counselling (GC), we studied knowledge and perceptions in parents with children with idiopathic 
ASD.
Materials and Methods: Parents with at least one child with ASD (n=39) answered a basal questionnaire addressing different topics, such as knowledge, 
perceived causes and RR or attitude towards genetics. A subset whose child had obtained negative results in molecular karyotype and exome sequencing (n=15) received GC and a following-up questionnaire afterwards and 
fifteen days later.
Results: Although most parents had received information about ASD, few 
had seen a medical geneticist or a genetic counsellor. Genetics was the most 
frequent perceived cause, especially among those with affected relatives. RR 
was overestimated by most parents and qualitative and quantitative estimates correlated. About half of parents believed that RR affected their family planning and their risk perception was higher compared to those who 
did not. After GC, quantitative but not qualitative RR estimates lowered and 
knowledge and favorable opinion towards genetics increased.
Conclusions: Although most parents perceived genetic factors as the most 
common cause of ASD, few had visited a genetics service. Perception of RR 
affects family planning and is overestimated by most parents. GC can improve knowledge and RR estimates and is key to take informed choices.

A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 â93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ï¬u  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ï¬uence genetic risk. I.M.

We report thecase of a prenatally diagnosed girl who carries a complex X chromosome rearrangement in a mosaic state. Amnio  centesis was performed because of intrauterine growthretardation, aortic hypoplasia and atypical serum markers. Karyotyping showed a mosaic 45,X/46,XX with additional X chromosome which seems to have abnormal structure.Array CGH showed revealed presence of an idic(X)(pter  > q12::q12  > pter) with multiplication of Xq13 region (con  taining Xist locus).

Common features deterioration observed in these individuals were signi ï¬cant loss of speech, loss of interest, abrupt deterioration of activities of daily living, moving slowly, eating slowly, and talking to themselves frequently. Prior to onset, none had anautism spectrum disorder. Trigger episodes causing the deterioration were not apparent except in one patient who experienced parental divorce. One 17 year old femalepatient recovered from the decline after 2 months of co  sleeping with her mother, two got restored after transferring to new school or work place, and two got restored by givingtheir special schedule in day care centers.; however, since the other 11 individuals did not show any improvement, an effective management strategy remained unclear. Our casessuggest that although rapid deterioration in DS is not a rare phenomenon, recovery is dif ï¬cult, but some cases demon  strate that this condition can be reversible on early recog nition by caregivers and medical personnel. Further studies with more cases may aid in the identi ï¬cation of a treatment strategy as well as prevention of rapid deterioration inyoung adults with DS. S. Mizuno: None. M. Inaba: None. H.

Non  recurrent genomic rearrangements often result fromreparative mechanisms such as Non Allelic Homologous Recombination (NAHR) during meiosis. In the present study we performed array Comparative Genomic Hybridi zation (aCGH) using Agilent Microarray Kit, 4 Ã 180 K in Bulgarian patients with comparable neurodevelopmental abnormalities such as epilepsy, intellectual disability,autistic and other neuropsychiatric features. A con ï¬rmation quantitive PCR of all aberrations was performed using SYBR Green qPCR technology and ÎÎCt method. aCGH revealed three deletions and two duplications in 4 patients affecting different chromosomes. The duplications were with size 1.856 Mb and 0.687 Mb and affected 17q12 and9q33.1 regions, respectively. They were found in young  sters with absence and generalized tonic  clonic seizures, mild ID, learning disability and behavior problems. In 4years old girl with ID, ataxia, seizures and delayed speech two microdeletions affecting 1q36 and 16p13.3 were detected  regions known to be associated with microdele tion syndromes. Additionally, homozygous deletion cover  ing the ï¬rst two exons of IMMP2L gene was found in girl with similar clinical characteristics. Despite the overlappingphenotype observed in our patients it appears that it is due to different chromosome regions affected. Therefore, it is important to use more extensive genomic approaches, suchas chromosomal microarray analysis in order to clarify the actual genetic causes of these complex conditions.

233, Paternal transmission of a FMR1 full mutation allele,P08.23,,"1Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain,2CIBERER and IDI  BAPS, Barcelona, Spain,3Hospital Parc TaulÃ­, Sabadell, SpainIntroduction: Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism. The molecular defect is a CGG repeat expansion in the 5 â untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Full mutation (FM) expansion from premutated alleles (PM) is only acquired via maternal meiosis. Paternal transmission always remainsin the PM range, from both PM and FM fathers. We present paternal transmission of a FMR1 PM FM allele in a 16  year old girl with a mild phenotype with learning dif ï¬cul  ties and anxiety. Material and Methods: The FMR1 CGG repeat expansion was molecularly characterized using the AmplideX Â®PCR/CE FMR1 Kit and AmplideX Â®mPCR FMR1 (Asuragen) in peripheral blood from the patient and her parents and in semen from the father. FMR1 gene expression analysis was performed using qPCR. Results:The patient inherited a normal allele (30 CGG, 2 AGG) from her mother and a mosaic PM FM non methylated allele (117  > 200 CGG, no AGG) from her father. Normalor slightly increased FMR1 mRNA levels were detected. The father showed an 88 CGG uninterrupted non  methylated allele in both blood and sperm cells. Conclu sion: The patient inherited a PM allele from her father that expanded to a FM in some cells and remained unmethy  lated. A postzygotic event (somatic expansion) is the mostplausible explanation for this paternal transmission. This case raises important questions such as whether prenatal diagnosis should be offered in cases in which the father istheFMR1 PM carrier.

237, A novel KDM6B gene de novo mutation in two siblings with a variable neurocognitive phenotype,P08.29,,"Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, Praha 5   Motol, Czech Republic Introduction: The clinical  and genetic heterogeneity of neurocognitive disorders (NCD) poses a signi ï¬cant diagnostic challenge. Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ï¬rst line diag  nostic  and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22  and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con  ï¬rmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme  thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ï¬ed a thirdâmutation âinKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ï¬ndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

Study and results: Cytogenetic analysis using standard G banding and FISH with labeled rDNA probes revealed an abnormalchromosome 13 with an enlarged p arm due to rDNA ampli ï¬cation in a male child, who had clinically con ï¬rmed mental retardation and an autistic behavior. This chromo some is evidently inherited from the father, who has mor  phologically the same chromosome, but is healthy. The karyotype of the mother was normal. Ag NOR stainingshowed brightly stained large whole p arm nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) in a child and normal sized NORs in his father with 13p + NOR amount mosaicism. qRT PCR with speci ï¬c primers showed highly increased levels of 18 S, 28 S and 5,8 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the patient âs blood samples compared to a normal healthy control donor. Both patient âs father and mother had no elevated levels of rRNAs expression. Conclusions: In this case rRNA level seems to correlate with mental retardationin familial individuals with 13p +. Our ï¬ndings of rRNA overexpression in a patient with mental retardation and his parents may show a possible link between the karyotype (p arm enlargement due to rDNA ampli ï¬cation), rDNA func  tionality (rRNA overexpression), functional changes in the brain and mental retardation.

242, Intragenic deletion in the NPAS3 gene identi ï¬ed in a patient with mild intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder,P08.35,,"Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, PolandThe NPAS3 gene encodes a transcription factor of the basic helix loop helix family involved in central nervous system development and adult neurogenesis. Disruption of NPAS3 has been described in a mother and daughter diag  nosed with schizophrenia and mild learning disability. Association studies have linked single nucleotide poly morphisms in NPAS3 with increased risk of schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Npas3 knockout mice show a de ï¬cit in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, aberrations in synaptic transmissions and display a range of behavioral phenotypes. NPAS3 is a locus with an excep  tionally high number of human speci ï¬c accelerated reg  ulatory elements (HAEs), i.e., non coding regions highly conserved during mammalian evolution but accumulating sequence changes in the lineage leading to humans afterhuman chimpanzee split. We present a 7 year old boy diagnosed with mild intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, discrete facial dysmorphism and clinodactyly of5thï¬ngers. Thus far only two NPAS3 deletions have been described in patients with mental retardation or cognitive decline and psychosis. ACGH analysis in the patient usingCytoSure ISCA, OGT detected a 392 kb deletion at chro  mosome 14q13.1 encompassing exons 4 and 5 of the NPAS3 gene. Parental aCGH analysis revealed that the deletion occurred de novo . The deletion disrupts the PAS (period, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, single minded) domain required for dimerization and removes HAEs: HCNS96,2xHAR142, HAR89, which act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. This case further supports the causative role of NPAS3 alteration in neurodevelopmental disorders. This work was granted from National Science Centre (OPUS 2015/17/B/ NZ5/01357 to BN) M. Smyk: None.

Recently, a speci ï¬cTBL1XR1 mutation, c.1337 A > C (p.Tyr446Cys) was described as the cause of Pierpont syndrome, a condition with a characteristic facies, shortstature, hearing loss, developmental delay and distinctive palmar and plantar fat pads. We report here a follow up oftwo unrelated patients with TBL1XR1 mutations. The patient 1 with de novo c.1331 C > T (p.Pro444Leu) muta  tion had psychomotor retardation, learning disabilities without intellectual disability, mild dysmorphism and Tourette syndrome. The patient 2 with de novo c.734 A > G (p.Tyr245Cys) mutation had psychomotor retardation,intellectual disability, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive dis  order, short stature, mild dysmorphism with short 4th and 5th metatarsals. The mutation of patient 1 is located near thespeciï¬c mutation of Pierpont syndrome but he had no share the distinctive features seen in Pierpont syndrome. The mutation of patient 2 have been already described byArmour et al. in a patient with similar clinical phenotype.

The phenotype varies in spectrum and severity owing to incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity. The 15q13.3 microdeletion is typically 1,6 Mb, harboring at least seven genes. Haploinsuf ï¬ciency of CHRNA7 is cau  sative for the majority of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. We present clinical, cytogenetic and molecular analysis of four cases with the15q13.3 microdeletion. All ï¬ndings were con ï¬rmed by FISH. In the ï¬rst case, array CGH revealed a 1,86 Mb maternally inherited microdeletion in a boy with languageand psychomotor delay, moderate intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and aggressive behavior. A 2,02 Mb mater  nally inherited microdeletion at 15q13.2q13.3 was found inthe second case. The boy manifested developmental and language delay, ADHD, and visual impairment. In these two cases, mothers were asymptomatic carriers of themicrodeletion. The third case presents a girl with language and psychomotor delay, impulsive and aggressive behavior, autism, and hypotonia. Here we detected a 1,69 Mbmicrodeletion in the 15q13.2q13.3 region and also a 506 kb intragenic microduplication of CNTN4 gene in the 3p26.3p26.2 region using arrray CGH. The CNTN4 gene is considered as a candidate gene in ASD. The proband âs mildly affected mother showed a 1,56 Mb microdeletion at 15q13.2q13.3.

There are several candidate genes in this region for mental retardation and epilepsy. The main characteristics include intellectual disability, speech delay, epilepsy and speci ï¬c facial features. Our patient was an 8 year old boy with the original diagnosis of Angelman syndrome. His prenatal and perinatal periods were uneventful. His development seemed normal until the age of8 months, at which point it stalled after he developed sei  zures. His epilepsy was dif ï¬cult to control, requiring several antiepileptic medications. When he was 8 year old, hedemonstrated severe intellectual disability by unstable walking with wide based gait and uplifted arms, absence of meaningful word production, inability to communicate, andautistic behavior. Physical examination revealed failure to thrive, microcephaly, bitemporal narrowing, thick eye  brows, long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, borderlinelow set ears, and micropenis. Brain MRI showed only pituitary hypoplasia. Angelman syndrome was diagnosed based on his clinical features and epilepsy, although thechromosome study, FISH for 15q11.2, SNRPN methylation test, and MECP2 sequencing analysis, which were also negative, given 20% of the cases have a diagnosis with thenegative DNA methylation test. Interestingly, the chromo  somal microarray revealed de novo deletion of 7 Mb on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q21.11 â9q21.2). Therefore, our patient was re diagnosed as having 9q21.13 micro  deletion syndrome. In summary, Angelman syndrome patients with negative test results should be considered forfurther investigations, given Angelman syndrome may not be the ï¬nal de ï¬nite diagnosis. K.

Patients and Methods Healthy 11 year old boy attendingregular school. Pervasive developmental disorder was sus  pected at four, with severe ODD, and ADHD. Conventional and molecular karyotypes were performed. FISH experi ments were completed using BAC clones for breakpoint âs approach. Gene expression assays were done using Taqman probes. Results The patientÂ´s karyotype was 46,XY,t(8;17)(q24.3;q22)dn. aCGH revealed no genomic imbalances. FISH analysis showed that the CTD 2599D24 probe span  ned the translocation breakpoint at 8q24.3, involving 2genes ( TSNARE1 and BAI1 ). Breakpoint at 17q22 was delimited between RP11 293B16 and RP11 277L08 probes, with a gene encoding a non characterized proteininvolved. Gene expression assays showed low BAI1 gene expression in the proband, compared to controls. Conclu  sion We speculate on the potential pathogenicity of thegenes contained in the 8q24.3 region that are likely to be disrupted by the translocation breakpoint, and responsible for the clinical features of our patient. BAI1 gene is mainly expressed in the brain. Recently, in vivo studies suggest that BAI1 regulates spatial learning and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. BAI1 also interacts with BAIAP2/IRSp53 ,a gene with a potential role in autism and psychiatric dis  orders. Thus, we propose that the impairment of BAI1 gene is responsible of our patient âs e behavioral phenotype. Further studies are ongoing to elucidate the exact breakpoint of the rearrangement.M.

Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of ASDs; it has been estimated that sub  microscopic copy number variants (CNVs) are the cause ofASDs in ~ 5 â13% of patients. We elected to use aCGH to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 178 patients with ASDs and toidentify novel ASDs genes. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using genome wide oligonucleo  tide microarrays (180k; Agilent Technology, OGT) with anaverage resolution of 30 kpz. We identi ï¬ed 25 CNVs in 21 out of 178 (11.8%) patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 12 (6.7%) patients, whereas CNVsof unknown clinical signi ï¬cance were found in 6.2% of patients with ASDs. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were sub  microscopic in size (between 75 kb and 4.54 Mb) and thuscould not have been detected by standard karyotype ana  lysis. Our study further con ï¬rmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by theidenti ï¬cation of two novel genes: ARHGAP24 and SLC16A7 as pathogenic for ASDs and three genes: SNX19 , PIGN andHCN1 as candidate for ASDs.

Monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders which showed autistic behavior patterns have sugges tedsynaptic dysfunction, as a key mechanism in the patho  physiology of ASD. Subsequently, genes involved in synaptic signaling have been investigated with a priority forcandidategene studies. A synaptosomal associated protein 25(SNAP25) gene plays a crucial role in the central ner  voussystem, contributing to exocytosis by targeting andfusion ofvesicles to the cell membrane. Studies have shown a correlation between aberrant expression of theSNA  P25and a varietyof brain diseases. Single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) inthis gene are associated with several psychiatric diseases, suchas bipolar, schizophrenia, and attention de ï¬cit/hyperactivitydisorder. The aim of the pre  sent study was to investigatewhether polymorphisms (rs3746544 and rs1051312) in theregulatory 3 â² untranslated region (3 â²UTR) of theSNAP25gene have an association with ASD in unrelated Iranian case(N ,524) control (N , 472) samples.

Pirogov Russian NationalResearch Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Mos  cow State University of Psychology and Education, Mos cow, Russian Federation, 4Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction Alzheimer âs disease (AD) is the leading cause of neurodegeneration. Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

280, 16p11.2 microdeletion and microduplication in two Lithuanian patients with speech delay,P11.01,,"Utkus1,2 1Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius, Lithuania,2Center for Medical Genetics, Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics, Vilnius, Lithuania Introduction: Recurrent 16p11.2 microdeletion and microduplication syndrome is a well described condition with various expression of neurocognitive features and congenital malformations. Incomplete penetrance of theaffected genes and variable expressivity usually is indicated as cause of clinical features. Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities.Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro  mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol  vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ï¬rmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet. Five disease related genes arelocated in affected region and only haploinsuf ï¬ciency sen  sitive TBX6 has indirect effect on neural development. V. Å liuas: None. B. Aleksiuniene: None. E.

Chromosomal GTG analysis of 100 metaphases of theperipheral blood revealed a karyotype with two SMCs 48, XX,+2mar. The father, paternal grandmother and one uncle all had the same abnormal karyotype with two copiesof the same SMC. One aunt and one cousin (the son of the paternal uncle with two SMCs) had only one marker. No mosaicism of the SMC was present in any family member.SKY revealed that the SMC was derived from chromosome 15, de ï¬ned as 48,XX, +2der(15)(pterq12). The origin of SMC was con ï¬rmed by FISH. According to the literature only 11 cases showed two copies of the same marker as in this report. Derivatives of chromosome 15 represent the most common SMC and may be associated with mental anddevelopmental retardation, seizures, autism spectrum dis  order and infertility. However, our patient and all the affected family members have presented normal develop ment, indicating that the markers might predominantly contain phenotypically silent heterochromatic domains. The acquired numerical changes in SMC inheritance in sub sequent generations suggest gametic cell mosaicism in individuals with 48 chromosomes, which can be explained by a strong instability of the pairing complex during themeiotic prophase. This study has provided characterization of the unusual segregation pattern of a familial SMC, as well as identifying the origin of this marker, resulting inbetter clinical management for the family.T.M.

397, Natural epigenomic variations manifesting as long contiguous stretches of homozygosity spanning theimprinted genes,P17.04,,"Iourov2,1,5 1Academician Yu.E. Veltishchev Research Clinical Institute of Pediatrics, N.I. Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Ministry of Health of the RussianFederation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russian Federation,3Moscow State University of Psychology and Education, Moscow,Russian Federation, 4I.M. Sechenov First Moscow Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation,5Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, RussianFederation Introduction Natural epigenomic variations in humans are poorly understood. For instance, long contiguous stret ches of homozygosity (LCSH) are consistently observed to be abundant in a human genome, but the role of these epigenomic variations in behavioral variability of the gen ome remains to be established. Recently, it has been shown that LCSH spanning loci of imprinted diseases (i.e. Angelman and Prader Willi syndromes) are associated withintellectual disability, autism and epilepsy (Iourov et al., 2015). Here, we have attempted to evaluate spectrum of epigenomic variations (LCSH) involving imprinted genes,which are not associated with a speci ï¬c disease. Methods Using SNP array molecular karyotyping (Affymetrix), we evaluated genomes of 350 children with intellectual dis ability and ASD. An original bioinformatics technique (Iourov et al., 2014) and a gene imprint database were applied to address LCSH pathogenicity involving imprintedgenes. Results LCSH involving imprinted genes was found in 263 (75%) individuals. LCSH encompassed following imprinted genes: PSIMCT 1 (33.4%), LIN28B (8%), RB1 (7%), ZC3H12C (6.9%), DNMT1 (5.4%), MAGI2 (5.1%), NPAP1 (3.7%). Proportions of individuals exhibiting these LCSH are given in parentheses. We have not found theseepigenomic variations to possess phenotypic effects. Con  clusions This study evidences for an additional type ofinterindividual (epi)genetic variations, which are likely to be benign in cases of the aforementioned genes in contrast to imprinted genes located at 7q21.3, 7q31.2, 11p15.5, 15p11.2 (according to Iourov et al., 2015). These natural epigenomic variations should be taken into account in future diagnostic and basic genomic/epigenomic studies.Supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project #14  15 00411). S.G.

1, How will the present time in genetics beremembered?,PL1.2,,"Netherlands ,2Dept of Clinical Genetics ,Maastricht UMC , Maastricht ,Netherlands At 50 years, the Society of Human Genetics has con  ï¬dently assumed its current position as a pillar of modern medicine. Is ours a special time? Have we reached the1234567890();,: 1234567890();,:high point of Human Genetics? I don ât think that the history of human genetics ends here at all. Rather, it seems that fundamental change is still very much in the air. First, let âs celebrate that after more than 100 years, the battle between the Mendelia ns and Biometricians has ï¬nally ended. And it is a draw. Mendelian rare conditions mainly re ï¬ect gene disruptions subject to strong selective forces, whereas common complex disease largely re ï¬ects common polygenic regulatory v ariation of gene activity. Sometimes these mix, as for the major neurodevelop  mental disorders: Intellectual disability, Autism, and Schizophrenia are mostly due to a mix of polygenic andde novo single gene variants. The Mendelian forms being associated with lower IQ. As Galton predicted in the 19 th century, height is generally polygenic and Peter Vis  scher âs work has used this data to show that most of the heritability is not missing but undetected, because the effects of individual loci are too small to pass stringentsigniï¬cance tests. Work from Sardinia shows that some of the alleles that confer short s tature affect known Mende  lian genes, which have drifted up to appreciable fre quencies in this population to create the well known island effect on height. After a period of frenzied activity following the invention of nex t generation sequencing, the era of monogenic disease gene discovery has passed its peak. At the same time, our ability to see pathogenic variation rather than infer it, is fundamentally changingmedicine and our societies. Rare diseases have become a recognized part of medicine, not just curiosities. One such area where gene based disco veries are changing medicine fast is cancer therapy. The understanding of the gene composition of the Philadelphia chromosome led to the ï¬rst targeted cancer drug, Imatinib. Other examples fol  lowed such as EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Soon, all w o m e nw i t hb r e a s ta n do v a r i a nc a n c e rw i l lb et e s t e df o r BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, to guide their therapy.Similar testing could happen for male patients with prostate cancer. All this will lead to an enormous increase in the detection of people with genetic predisposition forcancers, which constitutes a n interesting example of how Molecular Pathology and Mendelian predisposition genetics come together. Work by SÃ©golene Ayme andothers has led to the recent launch of the European Reference Networks whose purpose is to improve diag  n o s i sa n dc a r ef o rr a r ed i s e a s e sp a t i e n t sa c r o s sE u r o p e .NIPT represents another major triumph for the power of next generation sequencing technology. It is almost incomprehensible how NIPT seemed such a distant goalfor so many years. The diagnostic rate of exome sequencing and microarrays is between 20 and 60% for most diagnostic situations where Mendelian disease issought. This experience underlines that the genome is not entirely readable yet. Progress requires single celltechniques for mosaic situations, long read sequencing for repetitive elements and other genomic dark matter, and whole genome sequencing to capture smaller genomic rearrangements. All of these will come. Still, reading the genome does not equal understanding it. Fortunately, Functional Genomics is about to come of age, now thatthe groundwork has been done with the Hapmap, ENCODE and Blueprint projects. The future of Human Genomics will be radically different as we start to studyTraits rather than States, and this at the single cell level and in real time. Multi omics approaches will arrive soon, as will innovative gene therapy approaches. The futuremay turn out much more surprising and informative than any of us can now predict. H.

Here we assemble WES data on 100,289 individuals from a combination of cohort studies with electronic healthrecords (EHR) and case/control disease studies to evaluate the role that a burden of rare ( <0.1% allele frequency) loss of function (LoF) variants in 3,172 highly evolutionarilyconstrained genes (HC) plays in conferring risk for 13 quantitative traits and 10 diseases. Carriers of at least one HC LoF variant had increased risk of autism, schizophrenia,bipolar disorder, intellectual disability and ADHD (P values (p) range: 8 Ã 10 â4â1Ã1 0â14). The effect was stronger for individuals diagnosed with > 1 disorder, but also signi ï¬cant in those without comorbidities. In controls without any aforementioned disorder, we observed a signi ï¬cant asso  ciation with the broader ICD 10 category of mental/beha vioral disorders. Furthermore, carriers of HC LoF variants tended to be shorter (p ,2Ã1 0 â4), have fewer years of education (p ,3Ã1 0â4) and tended to be younger (p ,5Ã 10â7); the latter observation possibly re ï¬ecting reduced survival or study participation. Other gene sets (ClinVar genes, mice or cell lethal genes) did not show any LoF burden associations, however GWAS derived gene sets implicated in lipids and myocardial infraction showed a signiï¬cant LoF burden with the corresponding traits. Finally, using EHRs of 14,709 individuals, we performed a phenome wide scan and identi ï¬ed a signi ï¬cant association between HC LoF and chronic kidney failure (p ,2Ã1 0 â6) and with number of hospital visits (p ,0.0014).

Dr. Talkowski âs lab has integrated various molecular and computational genomics methods toevaluate the genomic landscape of balanced chromosomal abnormalities (BCAs). These analyses have revealed the remarkable complexity that can underlie their formation,often mediated by small inversions at the breakpoints, and the extreme examples of chromosome shattering, now recognized as âchromoanagenesis âand âchromothripsis â, that can occur in the viable human germline and often resolve to a massive yet balanced reorganization of the chromosomes. These studies have also surveyed the con tribution of de novo BCAs (translocations, inversions, insertions, and balanced chromoanagenesis) to human congenital anomalies and the remarkable reservoir of novelgene discovery possible from the delineation of BCAs in such individuals, as well as their diagnostics yields. These analyses also observed apparent âhotspots âof BCA forma  tion and the consequences of apparent alterations of higher order nuclear organization of the chromosomes, such as disruption of a topologically associating domains (TAD)harboring known driver loci of microdeletion syndromes, suggesting alternative regulatory mechanisms of genomic disorders. Ongoing studies have also begun to characterizethe diversity of structural variation, including recurrent yet complex forms of inversion variation in the human germ  line, as well as the contribution of all classes of structuralvariation to the genetic architecture of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders in the coding and noncoding regulatory genome. These studies collectively suggest thatstructural variation represents a major component of the genetic etiology of human developmental anomalies, and that emerging genomics technologies and large scalereference maps will be critical to de ï¬ne, interpret, and accurately quantify the role of this unique class of genomic variation to human disease, both in basic research andclinical interpretation.16S08 New technologies in Neurogenetic",2017.0,,M.

34, Brain imaging genetics in neurodevelopmentaldisorders,S08.2,,"for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, NetherlandsWith more and more common genetic variants for neurodevelopmental disorde rs like ADHD, schizophrenia, and autism being identi ï¬ed, we ï¬nd ourselves facing a new bottleneck in understanding the etiology of those disorders: the functions of a variant/gene/locus identi ï¬ed and the way by which it increases disease risk, are oftenunknown. Brain imaging genetics   or neuroimaging genetics   offers an attractive human in vivo model to investigate the effects of (common genetic) risk factors onthe brain. However, after an initial hype, the ï¬eld of imaging genetics research has gone through a phase of disillusionment in recent years. Too many underpoweredcandidate gene studies without replication investigating single regions of interest have undermined the trust in this model. I will show that neuroimaging genetics is currentlymaking a convincing come back. Within the worldwide ENIGMA Consortium, we have performed GWAS to identify the genetic factors that contribute to the regional/global structures of our brain using well powered sam  ples. Based on those data, co mbined with the knowledge of the brain regions affected by neurodevelopmental dis orders, we investigated the genetic overlap between the variants determining brain structure from the ENIGMA studies and those in ï¬uencing disease risk from the studies of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and iPSYCH. Such studies are performed at the level of the global genetic architecture as well as at the level of single geneticvariants. I will show data on both approaches for schi  zophrenia and attention de ï¬cit/hyperactivity disorder. Based on those recent studies we can conclude that neu roimaging genetics offers a promising model system to understand the effects leadin g from a genetic variant to an increased risk for the neurodevelopmental disorder.Having gone through a rough start, more recent studies in thisï¬eld in well powered samples and employing brain wide/genome wide approaches offer a glimpse of theactual power of this human in vivo model.

Probands with 15q13.3deletions present with cognitive de ï¬cits, epilepsy, and aut  ism spectrum disorder (ASD), while duplication probands have a milder phenotype including borderline cognitivedeï¬cits, ASD, and ADHD. Encoding for the Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) highly expressed in the brain, CHRNA7 has been suggested as a candidate gene for these CNVs. We have utilized patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs)to determine the molecular phenotypes of 15q13.3 CNVs. In these cells, mRNA levels of genes within 15q13.3 CNVs correlate to their genomic copy number. For CHRNA7 duplications, we are able to show that the entire CHRNA7 gene is duplicated, resulting in mRNA overexpression. Importantly, small duplications that include the ï¬rst exon of OTUD7A do not appear to disrupt its expression.Surprisingly, both CHRNA7 gains and losses result in decreased Î±7 speci ï¬c calcium ï¬ux in patient derived NPCs. While this is puzzling considering the genomic and expression data, it does mirror clinical phenotypes observed in patients. Deletions likely have decreased calcium ï¬ux due to haploinsuf ï¬ciency of CHRNA7 . Overexpression of Î±7 subunits from duplications, on the other hand, result in ER stress, likely due to insuf ï¬cient chaperones required for folding, assembly, and traf ï¬cking of nAChRs. Subse  quently, fewer functional receptors reach the cell mem  brane. For both deletions and duplications, the decreased calcium ï¬ux results in down regulation of calcium signaling cascades, which may explain the neurobehavioral pheno  types observed in patients.

Detection rates in category <25th percentilefor T21 was 46.67% (45 cases), for T18 57.14% (7), T13 100% (7), triploidy 100% (10), TX 87% (8), monosomy X 12.5% (8) and monosomy X mosaic 16.66% (6). Conclusions: Although ADAM12 does not satisfactorily detect T21, it is sensitive for the detection of T13, triploidy and TX. Decreased ADAM12 levels could be due to defective Xchromosome inactivation, as ind ependently suggested by XIST overexpression associated with psychiatric disorders and TX. Signiï¬cantly decreased ADAM12 levels are a ssociated with placental dysfunction and impaired CNS differentiation. Only ADAM12 enables prenatal scree ning of developmental andpsychiatric disorders related to TX, and fosters their early prevention and eventually also therapy.

The phenotype of affected individuals ranges from lethal arthro  gryposis multiplex to mild intellectual disability or autismspectrum disorder. Approximately 30 cases have been reported to date, but data on prenatal phenotype are scarce. Methods : We performed a ï¬le review of six patients (including three from the same family, and two siblings) diagnosed after birth with Schaaf Yang syndrome at our centers in a clinical setting, compiled prenatal andmolecular data, and reviewed the literature. Results : Prenatal ï¬ndings in our patients include fetal akinesia (2/6), pyelectasis (2/6), increased nuchal translu cency (1/4), intra uterine growth retardation (1/6), contrac  tures (1/6), and cerebral anomalies (1/6). All were severely affected after birth with progressive contractures anddevelopmental delay. Two had severe hydronephrosis, while another had renal failure. Molecular analyses identi ï¬ed truncating variants in MAGEL2 : c.1762C>T, c.3043C>T, and c.1996dupC. We reviewed data on 33 cases reported between 2009 and 2017, including 10 with prenatal manifestations. Prenatal features include fetalakinesia (7/10), contractures (4/10), and polyhydramnios (3/10). In addition, two children without reported prenatal features were small for gestational age. Conclusions : Although Schaaf Yang syndrome can present prenatally, the features may be mild or absent. Fetal akinesia, contractures, and polyhydramnios arerecurrent, but are absent in more than 50% of cases. The syndrome should be considered when fetal akinesia or contractures are associated with growth retardation, pye lectasis or oligohydramnios. G. D'Amours: None. F. Rossignol: None. F. Rypens: None.

In fetuses, congenital heart defects are found 3 5 times more often. Currently, Array Comparative GenomicHybridization (array CGH) is recommended by the Amer  ican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as a ï¬rst line test in the prenatal diagnosis of fetuses with sono graphic abnormalities especially cardiac defects. We present the results of oligonucleotide array applica  tion in a cohort of 353 prenatal cases with the fetal cardiacabnormalities, detected by ultrasound scan. In all cases amniocentesis was performed at 12 24 weeks of gestation. DNA was extracted from amniotic ï¬uid and trophoblast. Array CGH was performed using 60K microarrays 8x60K from Oxford Gene Technology (CytoSure ISCA, v2 and v3). The most commonly found (56%) are aneuploidy: chromosomal trisomy 21, 18, 13 and Turner syndrome. In cases with aneuploidy, the most common heart malforma tions are atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), atrial septal defect (ASD) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome, (HLHS).Heart defects are a characteristic phenotypic feature in common microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (34%), for example in the cases with deletion syndrome 22q11.2the most commonly defects are TOF, VSD and aortic coarctation (CAT). Rare aberrations accounted for 10% of all abnormal results.

In about 15% of cases, craniosynostosis is syndromic and multiple sutures are usually affected. Most of the syndromic patients have amutation in one of FGFR genes, that affect cell signaling e.g. RAS/MAPK pathway. Patients and methods: We present clinical evaluations of 3 patients with craniosynostosis and the clinical features of Noonan syndrome. The mutation analysis in these patients was performed using classic Sanger sequencing (2pts) orpanel next generation sequencing (1pt). Results: All patients, besides typical features for Noonan syndrome, like short stature, short neck and dysmorphicfeatures, had abnormal shape of the skull. The patient with p.Ala72Ser mutation in the PTPN11 presented with scaphocephaly, ASDII and cryptorchidism. Patients withmutations (p.Thr58Ile and p.Asp153Val) in the KRAS gene had macrocephaly and developmental delay. One of them had parietal foramina, submucous cleft palate and vertebraldefect, and the other one choanal stenosis and cryptorchidism.

Genetic defects at the Lysosome Associated Membrane 2Protein (LAMP2) are the cause of the disorder. Due to the rarity of the disease, there is limited progress in under  standing the correlation between genotype and phenotype,and explaining the large variability observed in the clinical features of this disorder. Materials & Methods: The index case and her relatives underwent full cardiological assessment. DNA libraries were prepared using Illumina âs Trusight Cardio sequencing panel, covering 174 clinically relevant genes to cardiacdiseases. VariantStudio v2.1 software and Sophia Genetics DDM platform were used for annotation, classi ï¬cation and ï¬ltering of genomic variants. Results: In this study we report two twin sisters, presented in our hospital with end stage heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, requiring heart transplantationevaluation. Genetic analysis showed that they both carried a LAMP2 missense variant, c.928G>A. The mutation was not detected in their mother. Their father died at 38 years of age,suffering from end stage heart failure of unknown reason. This variant has already been reported by others and was correlated with the clinical triad of Danon disease i.e.hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mental retardation and per  ipheral myopathy, as well as autism in one case. In this study, we present dilated cardiomyopathy as a newphenotype for this particular mutation.

169, A novel MID2 mutation as a cause of X linked intelectual disability 101,P08.19,,"Centro AcadÃ©mico de Medicina de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal A mutation in MID2 has recently been associated with X  linked intellectual disability 101 (IDX101) in a large kin dred with affected males showing variable degrees of intellectual disability (ID), global developmental delay (GDD) and hyperactivity. Other features, present in morethan half of the individuals, were speech disorder and strabismus. Dysmorphic features were insigni ï¬cant, except for a long face. Herein, we describe two maternal half brothers with ID/ GDD in whom a hemizygous variant, c.668G>A, p. (Arg223His), was identi ï¬ed in MID2 through trio based whole exome sequencing (WES), including both boys and their unaffected maternal grandfather. The older brother (14 years old) has severe ID, along with mild autism spectrumdisorder (ASD), microcephaly, strabismus, atrial septal defect and dysmorphic features including a long face, downslanting palpebral ï¬ssures, bilateral epicantus, long and pear shaped nose, thin upper lip and retrognathia. The younger brother (6 years old) has moderate GDD with severe language impairment, severe ASD, astigmatism andless marked dysmorphic features (a similar nose and retrognathia). The variant, classi ï¬ed as of uncertain signiï¬cance (class 3), is absent in the grandfather and present at a very low frequency in population databases and is located in a highly conserved residue of the MID2 protein. Other etiological investigations, including meta bolic panel, FMR1 PCR and array CGH were normal. Taking all into account, we believe this could be the cause of the boys âphenotypes, being the second family described with IDX101.

It is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, behavioral, sleep and feeding problems, eye abnormalities, constipation and seizures. Facial features can be mildly dysmorphic but are nonspeci ï¬c. In total, 18 patients have been reported. We describe an 18 year old boy who has been examined since preschool age because of hypotonia, speech disorder and strabism. His facial pheno type was not remarkable, but with advancing age features such as broad, prominent forehead, bushy eyebrows, deep  set eyes, depressed nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, low setposteriorly rotated ears, wide mouth with thin upper lip and broad chin became more pronounced. He had abnormalities of extremities, abnormal CNS MRI ï¬ndings and recurrent respiratory infections. He suffered from underweight affecting fat and muscular components, and showed anxietyand autistic traits. Previous specialized investigations failed to explain the etiology of his affection. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous WAC frameshift variant NM_016628.4:c.383del, p.(Pro128Leufs*64) which was absent from all databases. All other patients with WAC mutations also carried truncating variants spread across thegene. The long follow up of our patient allowed delineating of the WAC  related phenotype and its developmental tra  jectory. The facial phenotype was consistent with previouscases, but we show that the main features become more pronounced with age. Nevertheless, the guidance from phenotype is rather limited and it is likely that additionalcases of this syndrome will continue to be identi ï¬ed via the genotype  ï¬rst approach.

The implication of ZMYND11 , a gene located within this region, in the phenotype (essentially character  ized by developmental and motor delay, craniofacial dys  morphism and hypotonia) was also hypothesized. Patient and methods: We present the case of a 8 month male referred to our consult ation due to developmental delay and facial dysmorphisms. He was the second childof a non consanguineous couple born after an uneventful pregnancy with a normal pe rinatal period. His elder brother presents autism without speci ï¬c phenotypical features. At 8 months, he presented hypotonia, growth failure, bilateral cryptorchidism and hypospadias. Neurophysiological studies and biochemical analyses showed normal results. Nowadays (6y), as major features, he has no verbal language and presents a peculiar facial phenotype with hypertelorism and narrow palpebral ï¬ssures, low set ears, prominent crus and auricular pit, among others. Informed consent was obtained from his parents for subsequent studies: conventional karyotype, aCGH, Prader Willi Syndrome associated defects and exome variants werestudied. Results: Karyotype and aCGH analysis revealed no alterations. Prader Willi Syndrome was discarded (neithermethylation nor CNV alterations were found at 15q11 region).Exome analysis revealed the presence of a previously described pathogenic variant on ZMYND11 gene [c.1798T>C (p.Arg600Trp)]. Family analysis (parents and brother) con ï¬rmed its de novo origin. Conclusion: The clinical and molecular ï¬ndings in our patient con ï¬rm the association of this identi ï¬ed variant with the described phenotype and the implication of ZMYND11 gene in 10p15.3 deletion syndrome.

187," A microdeletion including the gene NUS1 demonstrating interpretation problems, expansion of the phenotype andtreatment modi ï¬cation",P09.01,,"Medical Center, Be'er Ya'akov, Israel Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is nowadays recognized as essential in the evaluation of autism and developmentaldelay. CMA interpretation depends on databases as ClinGen, DECIPHER and others, which lack information, and original papers are still essential in deciphering thesigniï¬cance of microdeletions/microduplications. We pre  sent an 8.5 years old boy, with intractable epilepsy, autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), hypotonia during infancy, stra bismus and behavioral problems. Multiple EEG examina  tions revealed frequent generalized interictal and ictal slow spike & wave discharges. He has various seizure types, andis treated with a combination of valproic acid, clobazam and ethusuximide with a relative improvement but partial con  trol. The child exhibited behavioral problems includingaggression and violence, with recurrent rage attacks. Levetiractam administration escalated the frequency of these behaviors signi ï¬cantly, and therefore was dis  continued. Metabolic workup was normal including: lactic, ammonia, blood amino acids, Carnitine, Acylcarnitine. A chromosomal microarray performed demonstrated a dele tion on chromosome 6: arr[hg19]6q22.1(117,431,000  118,040,939)x1. This 609kb deletion including the NUS1 gene is located within the minimal essential critical regionon chromosome 6q22. The region is known for autism, seizures, tremor and mild dysmorphic features, but less known for behavioural problems as in the case presented.The databases mentioned had only scarce information on the microdeletion, and we found only one paper interpreting it. This work further delineates this rare genetic disorder.We suggest that behavioral problems are part of this microdeletion, and suggest caution using Levetiractam in these patients.

Obregia Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry, Bucharest, Romania,4Victor Babes National Institute of Pathology, Bucharest, Romania,5Titu Maiorescu University, Bucharest, Romania Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairment of social interaction,reduced communication skills and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The etiology of ASD is complex including genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. 2q13 dupli cation have been associated with developmental delay, intellectual disability, ASD and dysmorphism. Several previous studies have linked the NPHP1 gene, located inthis genomic region, to ASD. In this paper we report a new case of 2q13 duplication in association with ASD and intellectual disability. The patient is a 5 years old boy bornat term from health, non consanguineous parents who was referred to the department of Child Psychiatry for speech delay and behavioral problems. Clinical evaluation revealeddysmorphic features (high forehead, large protruding ears, open held mouth), severe speech delay (he says only 6 simple words), moderate intellectual disability, autisticbehavior (no visual contact, dif ï¬cult social interaction, stereotypic movements). The genomic pro ï¬le obtained by array CGH (Agilent platforms) unveiled a 645 Kb dupli cation at 2q13 (110457697 111103309, hg18) encompass  ingRGPD6 ,MALL andNPHP1 genes. To date, 11 cases with 2q13 microduplication, including NPHP1 andMALL genes, have been reported. All patients presented behavior problems including ASD, attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder. Intellec tual disability was also noted in 8 patients. Other features described in some cases were speech delay and dysmorphic traits. All these ï¬ndings were found in our case, further contributing to the delineating of the 2q13 microduplication. I.O.

Here we report autistic behaviour patient with lack of speech and developmental delay that was referred for genetic testing. Both father andbrother of the proban are heterozygous carriers of beta  talasemia mutations. The patient was previously tested for Fragile X syndrome and X linked mental retardation relatedgenes were sequenced as well as whole exome sequencing was performed without detecting any relevant variants correlating with the clinical features. The only positiveresult was for HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 genes predisposing to celiac disease. At the end aCGH array (180K) was per  formed and it detected 278kb duplicated region (11p14.3 /chr11: 22102205 22361578) that included the ANO5 and SLC17A6 genes. This duplication was interpreted as uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance based on the international recommendations. Second aCGH analysis with higher resolution (2,7M) was perform so we can gain additional information and eventually to clarify the previous ï¬nding. An additional duplication of 312 kb was detected in chro  mosome 15 (15q11.2), which included 4 genes: TUBGCP5 , CYFIP1 ,NIPA2 and NIPA1 (PMIDs: 28588435, 27566550). Duplication was inherited by the father who is without clinical manifestation. The 15q11.2 BP1 BP2 region is found duplicated or deleted in people with cog nitive, language, and behavioral impairmen and a variable phenotype so probably this ï¬nding is the leading cause for the clinical features in the affected child.

194, Metabolism of vitamin D system in children with autismspectrum disorders,P09.10,,"Introduction: The frequency of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) over the past 5 years has increased from 1:110 to1:68 and continues to grow. An important role in etio  pathogenesis of ASD is given to metabolic disorders, in particular, to the disorder of metabolism of vitamin D sys tem, which plays one of the leading roles in maintaining the epigenetic health of the organism.Purpose: To study the state of vitamin D metabolism in children with ASD for the development of the examination and treatment algorithms. Results: We examined 130 children: 86 with ASD and 44 neurotypical. The polymorphism Bsml of the VDR gene was studied: bb (pathological homozygote)   13 (15.20%)and 0 (0%), respectively, Bb   43 (50.00%) and 26 (59.09%), BB   29 (33.72%) and 18 (40.90%). 95% of children with ASD showed a decrease of 25 OH D level inthe blood, whereas in the control group in only 9% cases. Polymorphic variants of the genes methylation cycle were studied: an increase in the frequency of MTHFR 677 C/Tpolymorphisms (47.67% and 36.36%, respectively), MTHFR 677 T/T (9.30% and 6.82%), MTRR 66 G/G (31.40% and 25.00%), MTR 2756 A/G (44.19% and34.09%).

Materials and Methods: We examined a 6 years old male patient with a mild dysmorphic features: short palpebral ï¬ssures, long eyelashes, large ears with ï¬eshy lobe and outward turned helix, hyperlaxity of joints. The boy is only child of non consanguineous healthy parents with no history of congenital anomalies or developmentaldelay. The boy was born with uses of vacuum extraction after 41 weeks of an uneventful pregnancy. At birth, he presented macrosomia (4230g/57cm, head circumference37cm), bilateral postaxial polydactyly and stridor. Devel  opmental delay presented from early stages, later he demonstrated poor speech. He was diagnosed autismspectrum disorder at the age of 3 years. At the age of 5 years he demonstrated subclinical epileptiform activity on EEG. Results : Chromosomal microarray analysis using Affy  metrix Cytoscan 750k array revealed a 6 Mb microdeletion960 J. del Picchiaat 4q24 region (arr[hg19] 4q24(101574821_107631432) x1). Due to bioinformatics assay deletion was classi ï¬ed as variant of unknown signi ï¬cance. However, deletions comprising the region 4q24 have recently been described among individuals with an overlapping phenotype. The CXXC4 gene located in deleted region might be a candidategene for postaxial polydactyly, as it inhibits the Wnt  signaling pathway and subsequently transcription of GLI3 gene, which is associated with polydactyly. Conclusions: We assume that the 4q24 locus is associated with a combination of polydactyly and mental retardation. Finding candidate genes associated withcognitive impairment is a potential target for further investigation. O. Novoselova: None. E",2018.0,,"O.

The worldwide prevalence of autism is increasing.However, autism prevalence is low (0.27%) in Brazil due to misdiagnosis of the disorder. Material and Methods: We report on 16 probands with ASD referred by the public health system of GoiÃ¡s. ASD assessment using Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI R), G band karyotyping, and PCR of FMR1 using Amplidex Â®kit were carried out for all patients. Chromoso  mal Microarray Analysis (CMA) using GeneChipÂ®CytoScanHDTMarray was done for patients who had normal results in karyotype and PCR. Results: The behavioral phenotypes for all participants were classi ï¬ed in the ASD according to ADI R results whose karyotypes showed neither visible numerical nor structural chromosomal aberrations. FMR1 analysis revealed two children affected by Fragile X Syndrome. CMA showed a total of 21 CNVs identi ï¬ed in 12/14 (86%) patients. A total of 13/21 pathogenic CNVs were observedin 8 patients, all located at genetic ASD hotspots, including 22q11.23, Xp22.33 (2/13), 16p11.2 (3/13), harboring no OMIM genes. However, the hotspots at 15q13.3, 15q11.2(2/13), and Xp11.23 (2/13) harbored CHRNA7 ,PWRN2 and ZNF630 genes, respectively, associated with ASD. The remaining CNVs were classi ï¬ed as having unknown clinical signi ï¬cance, distributed at loci: 2q12.2, 3p22.1, 9p21.1 (3/8), Xp22.32, Xq21.1, and Xq24.

230, Report of a child with a nearly complete 17p duplication,P11.04,,"Introduction: The phenotypic characteristics of the dupli  cations are variable according to their size and the generegions they contain. Such chromosomal gains that generate suspicious images at chromosome analysis can be fully demonstrated by the array CGH method. Materials and Method: Firstly chromosome analysis was performed and a chromosomal change was found. To investigate the basis of the change, chromosome analysis in the parent and arrayCGH for the patient were performed. Results: A 2.5 month old girl was referred to our clinic because of the growth retardation and presence of triangularface, high palate, and low ear. Patent Foramen Ovale, secundum ASD and right cerebellomedullary cervical cyst, myelination delay, slit ventriculs and corpus callosumpartial agenesis were present in the brain MRI of the SGA baby with hypotonia, feeding dif ï¬culty, apnea, GER. The chromosome analysis of the patient was found as 46,XX,der(15)add(15)(p13) subsequently to clarify the infrastructure of this change, parents âchromosome analysis and patient âs array CGH were performed.

At presentation he crawled without any speech development. Length and head circumference were below3 rdcentile, weight 75th 90thcentile. He showed narrow and short palpebral ï¬ssures, an epicanthus, long eyelashes, small nose, broad nasal bridge, low set ears with largelobes, open mouth with tented upper lip, small chin, small hands and feet with 2/3 syndaktyly. Array CGH analysis uncovered an interstitial 6.5 Mb deletion of 2q22.3 q24.1conï¬rmed in the child and excluded in parents by FISH analyses. In literature the 2q23.1 deletion syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment,autistic like behavior, sleep abnormalities, seizures, ataxia, microcephaly, hypotonia, initially feeding dif ï¬culties, later hyperphagia, coarse face, abnormalities of the ears and theeyes, open mouth, prominent incisors, tented upper lip, short hands and feet. The size of the described deletions varies (38 kb to 19 Mb) with the smallest region of overlapcontains only the MBD5 gene. The protein encoded by MBD5 is expressed in brain and is involved intranscriptional regulation interacting with e.g. MECP2. Symptoms of isolated MBD5 alterations and 2q23.1 dele  tions overlap but some features (e.g. microcephaly, hyper  phagia, open mouth with downturned corners, small hands/ feet) are observed predominantly in 2q23.1 deletion, sug  gesting further deleted genes contribute to an extendedphenotype.

Structural aberrations of chromosomes are associates with various syndromes, although there are a lot of cho mosomal gains and losses that are not yet associated with a speciï¬c syndrome. Most of the cases are the novo, few cases are due to unbalanced rearraments and others areinherents. We present a three years old boy derived from neuropediatric for genetics studies due to global develop  mental delay. He was born at 38 gestation week from noconsanguineous healthy parents. Karyotype in leucocites was normal (46;XY). Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH Array) with the Nimblegen CGX CytogeneticMicroarrays platform, suplied by PerkinElmer, was per  formed for the patient and parents. The CGH  Array was normal en both parents, but the patient presented a delecc tion of 2,40 Mb in 18q22.1 q22.3 chromosomical region (arr[hg19] 18q22.1 q22.3 (66,375,444 68,773,023)x1 Abnormal Male). The duplication is âde novo âand no previously described. These delection have 11 genes included (5 OMIM) and then with a high pathologic prob  ability. . Chromosomic aberrations detected âde novo âand no previously described can be di ï¬cult to determine his pathologic potential, and it is necesary to have in mind the patient pathology and genes involved in the delecction/duplication . In our case we believe that the chromosomal alteration detected, alone or in conjuntion with another chromosomal or enviromental cause will be responsible ofthe patient pathology. M.

307, Williams Beuren syndrome: clinical variability in a Nord Eastern Romanian cohort,P11.89,,"âGr. T. Popa âUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy   Department of Medical Genetics, Ia Åi, Romania Williams Beuren (WS) syndrome (7q11.23 microdeletion), is a syndrome with wide clinical variability. We have stu  died 22 patients diagnosed with WS and followed up for a long time (average period 7 years) in Iasi Medical GeneticsCenter, aiming to describe clinical variability and the changing picture in time. All cases were con ï¬rmed using MLPA follow up kit. We identi ï¬ed cardiovascular disease in 18/22 patients (72.22% supravalvar aortic stenosis), characteristic dysmorphic faces in 19/22, intellectual dis  ability in 19/22 (5 severe, 9 moderate, 5 mild) and con nective tissue defects in 16 cases (40.95% presented hernia). Less common features included: pre  and early post natal growth de ï¬ciency (18/22), friendly personality (16/22), speciï¬c cognitive pro ï¬le (13/22), strabismus and dental anomalies (9/22), gastro intestinal disturbances (9/22), obesity (6/22), hypercalcemia (3/22) and hypothyroidism(1/22). Short stature and increased sensitivity to sound were found in only 7 and 5 patients, and only 1 case presented hearing loss and enuresis. Cryptorchidism, as well as renaldefects were identi ï¬ed in 4 cases, anesthesia accidents in 2 and diabetes and hypoplastic abdominal aorta in one.We didnât detect non social anxiety, speci ï¬c phobias or early puberty. Other features identi ï¬ed in our patients include: brachydactyly (5/22), autism spectrum disorder (4/22), dysmenorrhea (2), hypogonadism (3/22), scoliosis (2/22),marked microcephaly and psoriazis (1/22) and ischemic stroke (1/22). The changing phenotype in time will be illustrated for cases with long term follow up.

Despite a wide variety of available data, speci ï¬c biological processes underlying abnormal neurodevelopment remain to be unmasked. Here, we have used molecular cytogenetic data to analyze speci ï¬c pathways leading to neuropsychiatric diseases in children. Materials and Methods: Conventional and molecular karyotyping was used to evaluate 427 patients with idiopathic intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, andcongenital malformations. An original bioinformatic tech  nique based on candidate process prioritization (Iourov et al., 2014; Yurov et al., 2017) was applied to pathwayenrichment among these patients. Results: Molecular cytogenetic analysis has shown CNVs relevant to a pathway functional change in 397children (93%). The highest enrichment rates (gene percentage among all the prioritized candidate genes/ processes) were found for the following pathways: cellcycle (4.68%), MAPK signaling (6.56%), pathways in cancer (11.94%), DNA replication (1.64%). All the children exhibiting the genomic variations altering genes involved inthese pathways were found to present with chromosome instability (mosaic aneuploidy, chromosome breaks/fragi  lity, non speci ï¬c structural chromosomal rearrangements), whereas the remainder was not demonstrating de ï¬nable chromosome instability. Conclusions: Alterations to pathways associated with genome/chromosome stability maintenance through the cell cycle were shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases. The consequences of the altera tions were found to be detectable at chromosomal level. These data supports a previously proposed hypothesis describing two /multiple hits to genome stability as apossible mechanism of neuropsychiatric diseases (Iourov et al., 2013).

7, miR 204 overexpression exerts a protective role in inherited retinal diseases,PL2.6,,"1Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM), Pozzuoli, Italy,2Dept. of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', Naples, Italy,3Department of Translational Medicine, University of Naples 'Federico II', Naples, Italy Introduction: Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are pro  gressive neurodegenerative conditions of the retina thatrepresent a main cause of genetic blindness in the Western world. Their high genetic heterogeneity hinders the devel  opment of effective gene based therapies. We have recentlydemonstrated that the microRNA miR 204 is essential for retinal function and plays a pathogenic role in IRD in humans. Therefore, we investigated the potential ther apeutic action of this microRNA in IRDs. Materials and Methods: We delivered by subretinal injection an adeno associated viral vector carrying the miR 204 precursor to the Aipl1 knockout and the P347S  RHO transgenic mouse lines, models of autosomal recessive and dominant forms of IRDs, respectively. The impact on retinalfunction and degeneration was assessed by electroretino  graphic and immunohistological analyses. Results: We detected a notable improvement of the ERG response in the miR 204 injected eyes of P347S  RHO mice. This effect persisted for two months post injection and was prevalent under photopic conditions that re ï¬ect cone activity. We also observed a preservation of cone photo  receptors and a signi ï¬cant decrease in apoptotic photo  receptor cells. Photoreceptors were better preserved also inthe miR204 injected eyes of Aipl1 knockout mice. Tran  scriptome analysis suggested that dampening of microglia activation represents one of the main mechanisms under lying the neuroprotective effect of miR 204. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings indicate that the subretinal delivery of miR 204 attenuates retinal degeneration in IRDmouse models and preserves retinal function, supporting the gene independent therapeutic potential of this microRNA.

Hydration of their reduced forms (either spontaneously if the temperature is elevated or following speciï¬c enzymatic processes) leads to the accumulation of NADHX and NADPHX, which are toxic and can inhibit a number of dehydrogenases. Highly conserved dehydrataseNAD(P)HX Dehydratase (NAXD) is one of the key intra  cellular NADHX/NADPHX repair enzymes. Materials and Methods: We describe 6 unrelated children with generally fever induced recurrent episodic neurological impairment and/or cardiac failure with early demise, and its genetic basis. Results: Genomic sequencing revealed biallelic NAXD variants in all cases, and in silico analyses predicting potential pathogenicity for each of them. Pathogenicity wasfunctionally validated using patient ï¬broblasts through a combination of transcript analysis (splicing abnormality in one case), demonstration of markedly elevated S NADHX,R NADHX and cyclic NADHX, impaired mitochondrial function, and reduced viability in culture media containing galactose and azide but not glucose. Transduction withwildtype NAXD restored damaged metabolite levels back to normal. Finally, in vitro studies revealed that the two missense variants [(p.(Gly63Ser) and p.(Arg608Cys)] werethermolabile, and speci ï¬c ATP dependent NADHX dehy  dratase activity showed abnormal enzyme kinetics. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst report of a human disorder caused by NAXD de ï¬ciency, showing remarkable clinical overlap with the other known defect of the NADH/NADPH repair pathway, NAXE de ï¬ciency.

Deletion cause Williams Beuren syn  drome (WBS) characterized by hypersociability, anxiety and intellectual disability, while duplication give rise to 7qduplication syndrome (7DupASD) with severe impairments in language, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the well established genetic underpinnings of thesedisorders effective treatments are unavailable. Converging evidence points to GTF2I as a major player mediating the cognitive behavioral phenotype associated with WBS and7DupASD. We showed previously in patient derived iPSC and neural progenitors that GTF2I associates with LSD1 to suppress expression of genes involved in neuronal function,whereas inhibition of LSD1 restored gene expression balance. Here we used mouse models together with patient derived 3D cortical organoids and single cell transcriptomics to dissectthe molecular foundations of WBS and 7DupASD. Mice with duplication of GTF2I faithfully recapitulated the ASD like phenotype in the three chambered sociability apparatus.Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1 with an irreversible inhibitor, rescued the ASD like phenotype. Bulk and single cell RNAseq from cortical organoids revealed divergent dynam ics of neuronal maturation with accelerated maturation in 7DupASD and decelerated in WBS organoids resulting in a divergent neural fate, which was con ï¬rmed by relative abundance of basal progenitor populations. Strikingly, knockdown of GTF2I in 7DupASD organoids rescued neu  ronal maturation rate to control levels. These ï¬ndings suggest that GTF2I LSD1 axis plays a critical role in social behavior and cognition by controlling the timing of cortical maturation. A. Lopez Tobon: None. R. Shyti: None. E.

Here we have used whole exome sequencing to uncover the endo plasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the cau  sative gene of a novel leukodystrophy. This enzyme catalizes the ï¬n a ls t e pi nt h e de novo biosynthesis of ceramides controlling the conv ersion of dihydroceramide (DhCer) to ceramide (Cer), and may play intriguing roles in antiapoptotic, and anabolic and insulin signalling.Through international collaborative networks, we have identi ï¬ed eighteen patients from twelve unrelated families carrying biallelic de leterious variants in the DEGS1 gene. Common features among the cases include severe hypomyelination, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum on MRI, accompanied by speechabnormalities, developmental delay and intellectual dis  ability, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 and ceramide metabolism in myelin development and maintenance.Patients âï¬broblasts exhibited accumulation of DhCer, which increased ROS production. Knockdown of the DEGS1 ortholog in Danio rerio recapitulated the bio  chemical imbalance of ceram ides, showed diminished numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and impaired locomotor abilities. The enzymatic inhibition of cer amide synthase, one step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, by the multiple sclerosis treatment Fingolimod (FTY720), restored the critic al DhCer/Cer balance, and ameliorated the cellular and locomotor phenotypes in the zebra ï¬sh model. These results pave the way to clinical translation, illustrating the tr ansformative, timely impact of clinical genomics in patient care.

64, Canary in the coal mine: the cerebellum as a sentinel for developmental brain disorders,E13.2,,"Institute, Seattle, WA, United States The cerebellum is often overlooked in assessing fetuses and children with developmental brain disorders because of multiple patterns of malformation that are inconsistently deï¬ned, lack of experience in recognizing these patterns, variable severity including non penetrance, occasional co  occurrence of atrophy, and limited understanding of the underlying causes. After excluding two well known groupsof autosomal recessive disorders with recognizable patterns of malformation (Joubert syndrome and pontocerebellar hypoplasia), cerebellar malformations have been con sistently observed with only two copy number variants (deletion 3q24 or 6p25.3) and a few genes (CASK, OPHN1 and FOXC1). Recent experience has shown that prenatalevents such as late 2nd early 3rd trimester posterior fossa and cerebellar bleeds and (less often) cerebellar ischemia, can cause cerebellar injuries that mimic cerebellar mal formations. Accordingly, genetic studies have shown a lower rate of abnormalities than other developmental dis  orders such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, intellectualdisability and autism. We have performed SNP microarrays in ~250 children and whole exome sequencing data in ~100 children with cerebellar malformations. Our analysis sug gests that cerebellar hypoplasia is a variable feature in many genetic developmental brain disorders, that prenatal injuriesto the cerebellum are common and can often be recognized based on the pattern of abnormality, and that these two processes may co occur.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col  laboration, we identi ï¬ed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var  iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ï¬cant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ï¬ciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand  or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno  types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region con  tains up to 10 genes and is associated with numerous conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD),epilepsy, schizophrenia and intellectual disability; however, the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis remain unknown. 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region impactsten genes and it is very complex to unravel the critical gene or genes that regulates the phenotype. Materials and Methods: We combined whole genome sequencing, human brain gene expression (proteome and transcriptome), and a mouse model with a syntenic heterozygous deletion (Df(h15q13)/ +mice) and determined that the microdeletion results in abnormal development of cortical dendritic spines and dendrite outgrowth. Large scale genetic data was integrated to ï¬nd out the most critical gene (s) within the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region. In addition, we have applied functional analysis in vivo and in vitro to identify phenotypes in mouse and human celllines. Results: Analysis of large scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data identi ï¬edOTUD7A as a critical gene for brain function. OTUD7A expression was found to localize to dendritic and spine compartments in cortical neurons, and its reduced expression in Df(h15q13)/ +cortical neurons contributed to the dendritic spine and dendrite outgrowth deï¬cits. Conclusions: Our results reveal OTUD7A as a major regulatory gene for 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotypes that contribute to the disease mechanism through abnormal cortical neuron morphologicaldevelopment.

Human accelerated regions (HARs) repre  sent conserved genomic loci with elevated divergence in humans compared to other primate and non primate species.At least some HARs are thought to contribute to neurode  velopmental functions underlying the unique social and behavioral traits of humans. If some HARs regulate human speciï¬c social and behavioral traits, then mutations would likely impact cognitive and social disorders. Recent studies support the role of HARs in complex neurodevelopmentalfunctions and associated disorders including Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia. Strikingly, through large scale whole genome and targeted HAR omesequencing we ï¬nd, for the ï¬rst time, that rare noncoding mutations in neurally active HARs contribute to simplex, multiplex, and consanguineous ASD cases. These mutationshighlight more than 20 HARs with putative essential roles in neural development. Functional validation of candidate HARs and underlying mutations using chromatin interac tion sequencing, high throughput reporter assays, and transgenic mice allowed for further functional character  ization of inherited HAR mutations in active regulatoryelements for RBFOX1 ,CUX1, PTBP2, GPC4, CDKL5 , and other genes implicated in neural function, autism spectrum disorder, or both.

Here, we systematically dissected the functional networks associatedwith 16p11.2 RGD from transcriptome analyses of 70 mice with reciprocal CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region across cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, as well as liver, white andbrown adipose tissues in a subset of 16 mice (n ,250 samples). We integrated these data with brain tissues from a Kctd13 mouse model (a putative driver of 16p11.2 neu  roanatomical phenotypes, n ,50), and CRISPR engi  neered, isogenic 16p11.2 iPSC derived NSCs (n ,25) and induced neurons (n ,27). The strongest magnitude of effect sizes from 7qF3 were observed across brain regions by comparison to non brain tissues (cortex 7qF3 region aver  age p value ,8.80E 35; non brain p ,0.0013), re ï¬ecting the ~3x higher basal expression changes. Coexpression network analyses isolated a consistent module of 16p11.2 genes, as well as a module that was highly enriched forconstrained genes (ExAC pLI â¥0.9), autism associated genes, early fetal development coexpression networks derived from BrainSpan, and neurological phenotypes andprocesses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in this âconstrained âmodule network; moreover, DEGs from the Kctd13 mouse coalesced into this samemodule (cortex enrichment p ,7.82E 41), suggesting overlap in altered transcriptional networks between full length CNV and deletion of KCTD13 alone. These analysesidentify a tissue speci ï¬c impact of 16p11.2 RGD that converges on a module of co expressed genes that are intolerant to genetic perturbation and associated with criticalprocesses in human neurodevelopment.

The homeobox protein NKX6 2 is a transcription factor regulating multiple developmental processes with a main role in oligoden drocyte differentiation and regulation of myelin speci ï¬c gene expression. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and homozygosity mapping of selected patients from three unrelated families was undertaken. The variants identi ï¬ed were validated by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation analysis. Results: Five affected subjects (three unrelated families) were documented to share biallelic inactivating mutationsaffecting the NKX6 2 homeobox domain. A trio based whole exome sequencing analysis in the ï¬rst family detected a homozygous frameshift change [c.606delinsTA;p.(Lys202Asnfs*?)]. In the second family, homozygosity mapping coupled to whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.565G>T) introdu cing a premature stop codon (p.Glu189*). In the third family, whole exome sequencing established compound heterozygosity for a non conservative missense changeaffecting a key residue participating in DNA binding (c.599G>A; p.Arg200Gln) and a nonsense substitution (c.589C>T; p.Gln197*), in both affected siblings. Theclinical presentation was homogeneous, with four subjects having severe motor delays, nystagmus and absent head control, and one individual showing gross motor delay atthe age of 6 months. All exhibited neuroimaging that was consistent with hypomyelination. Conclusions: Theï¬nding of individuals with a severe neurodevelopemental phenotype with hypomyelination associated with biallelic mutations in NKX6 2 provides direct evidence of the relevant role of NKX6 2 in CNSdevelopment in humans.

Genetic bases are prominent riskfactors for both disorders. Among others, loss of function mutations in CHD8 gene represents a recurrent risk factor for ASD, while CHD2 is more frequently mutated in epi  lepsy. Thus, the sole reduction in CHD8 orCHD2 expres  sion is able to cause cellular and molecular phenotypes that are key hallmarks to follow and rescue in assessing newtherapeutic approaches. Particularly, we aim to test SINEUPs, a novel class of synthetic antisense long non coding RNAs   able to increasethe translation of target proteins to physiological level without affecting transcription   to rescue the phenotypes caused by CHD8 orCHD2 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. Since the activity of SINEUP depends on two domains, an effector domain required for translation enhancement and a binding domain conferring target speci ï¬city, we designed SINEUP molecules able to recognize the initial and internal methionines of CHD8 and CHD2 proteins. We then proceeded to test the ef ï¬cacy of different SINEUPs on neural progenitors. From our preliminary observations, SINEUPs targeting internal methionines are more ef ï¬cient in stimulating CHD8 and CHD2 protein production, thusrepresenting a valid target to be further tested in patients â derived cell lines and in zebra ï¬sh, an in vivo model of the disorders.

It provides betterresolution than conventional karyotyping, nevertheless, CNVs with variable expressivity and low penetrance require a proper interpretation attitude. Materials and Methods: More than 2200 prenatal sam  ples (AMC, CVS) were examined at our clinic within the last two years. In 9.8% samples an aneuploidy was detectedby QFPCR. The remaining samples were analyzed by CMA as aï¬rst tier test: samples were assessed by array CGH (or SNP array) and analyzed with AgilentCytoGenomics soft ware. Parental samples were analyzed using CMA to spe  cify the origin of the identi ï¬ed aberrations. Results: 72 CMA analyzed samples were considered to be pathogenic (out of them 56 below karyotype resolution) while additional 112 cases as variants of unknown sig  niï¬cance: class 2, 3 and 4 (likely benign, uncertain clinical relevance, likely pathogenic) or without subclassi ï¬cation.

77,D The role of next generation sequencing in the differential diagnosis of congenital iris anomalies,P02.02,,"Genetics Department, IIS FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az  CIBERER, UAM, Madrid, Spain Abnormal development of the iris is a feature of severalcongenital ocular malformations. Classical aniridia, the most common form, is a panocular disease characterized by iris and foveal hypoplasia, keratopathy, cataracts andglaucoma, caused by PAX6 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. The pre  sence of variable expressivity and phenotypic overlapping with other types of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD)hinders the genetic characterization of atypical presentations of aniridia. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of NGS to improve the clinical diagnosis of these pathologies. Acohort of 106 families was studied, including cases with classical aniridia or atypical forms (iris hypoplasia, atrophy or coloboma). The entire PAX6 gene and other 260 genes associated with ocular malformations were analyzed using custom targeted NGS and aCGH approaches, as well as clinical or whole exome and/or Sanger sequencing. About82% of the cases presented likely pathogenic variants or CNVs in 5 different genes. Defects in PAX6 explain 75% of cases, including not only all characterized cases withclassical aniridia, but also 30% of patients with more atypical presentations, in whom LOF or atypical missense and non coding variants were identi ï¬ed, respectively. Other aniridia like patients presented pathogenic variants in ASD  related genes or variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance in candidate genes. Molecular analysis of iris malformationspresents high diagnostic yield not only in cases with classical aniridia (95%) but also in patients with aniridia  like phenotypes (>50%). Our work evidences the clinicalutility of differential genetic studies based on NGS in patients with congenital iris anomalies.

118,C Expanding the CPAMD8 associated eye disease spectrum to primary congenital glaucoma: lessons learned from a large consanguineous family withpseudodominance,P02.53,,"P. G. Kestelyn2, B. P. Leroy1,2, E. De Baere1 1Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium,2Department of Ophthalmology, Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium, 3Department of Ophthalmology, Children Hospital Queen Fabiola, Brussels, Belgium Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is de ï¬ned as an isolated trabeculodysgenesis that occurs in the ï¬rst three years of life and is most often caused by biallelic mutations in CYP1B1. Other early onset, developmental glaucomasmay arise secondary to developmental malformations of the anterior segment of the eye, and occur as part of an anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) disorder. Consequently, theseoverlapping phenotypes may challenge the diagnosis of PCG. Here we studied a highly consanguineous Jordanian pedigree with over 17 affected individuals in three gen  erations, displaying a clinical diagnosis of PCG. In addition to PCG, the proband also presented with iris atrophy,ectropion uveae and corectopia. Moreover, the familial history revealed the presence of other ocular manifestations in the family including cataracts, lens luxation and irisabnormalities. Using homozygosity based ï¬ltering of exome data, we identi ï¬ed a homozygous frameshift variant in CPAMD8: c.785_788del, p.Tyr262Serfs*17. This variantis not present in population databases and segregates with the phenotype in the family. Recently, CPAMD8 was reported as the cause for a unique autosomal recessive ASDthat is characterized by bilateral iris hypoplasia, ectopia lentis, corectopia, ectropion uveae, and cataracts, clinical features also observed here. Interestingly, two affectedsiblings who were initially diagnosed with PCG received a clinical diagnosis of megalocornea in retrospect. In con  clusion, we identi ï¬ed the molecular cause underlying a PCG phenotype in a large consanguineous family using combined homozygosity mapping and WES. Based on thisfamily and the previously reported families, CPAMD8  associated ASD should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis for PCG. H. Verdin: None. I. Balikova: None. J.

Friebe2, B. Niesler1, G. Rappold1 1Department of Human Molecular Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany,2Institute of Physiology, University of WÃ¼rzburg, WÃ¼rzburg, Germany,3Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but these symptoms are often overlooked and it is still not clear how GI dysfunction relates to the core features of ASD.FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectualdisability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano  metry. Several Foxp1 targets previously identi ï¬ed by microarray analysis in the brain were signi ï¬cantly deregu  lated in the oesophagus of Foxp1 +/  mice. The total gut transit was signi ï¬cantly prolonged. Spatiotemporal maps depicting the colonic contraction patterns revealed strongly disturbed contractility and peristalsis. Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism spectrum disorder may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1  dependent deregulation of genes. Furthermore, this is theï¬rst report of achalasia being caused by a heterozygous gene deletion. H. FrÃ¶hlich: None. M. Kollmeyer: None. M. Stuhlin  ger: None. V. Linz: None. D. Groneberg: None. A.

Approxi  mately 18% of patients have additional anatomical malformations or associated neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and intellectual disability. A subset of these patients have a known genetic syndrome in whichHSCR has a variable expression or penetrance. In others, the genetic etiology is unknown and we hypothesize that rare Copy Number Variation (CNV) impacts their diseasedevelopment. Indeed, rare Copy Number (CN) losses were signiï¬cantly enriched in patients with HSCR and additional anomalies without a known causal variant (n ,23, p,3.64E   7), and not in isolated HSCR (n ,20, p,0.700) or in HSCR patients with a known RET or other causal variant (n ,15, p,0.705). Of the HSCR patients with additional anomalies tested, at least ï¬ve (three males and two females) had a large de novo CNV and one male inherited an X linked CN loss. Patients with a known causal variant had a signi ï¬cant lower burden of the known HSCR predisposing risk haplotypes (P ,0.0232), and isolated HSCR patients a higher burden (P ,0.0277) compared to patients with HSCR and additional anomalies without a known causal variant. The rare CN losses identi ï¬ed are enriched for dosage sensitive genes, expressed in the developing mouse entericnervous system (ENS; p ,1.760E 10): SLC8A1 ,DDR1 , GNL1 ,GABBR1 ,MAPK8 ,UFD1L ,FHIT ,AKT3 ,TUBB , TBX2 ,BCAS3 andUSP32 . Additionally, the latter four, had rare putative deleterious variants in HSCR patients without a deleterious CNV, con ï¬rming our hypothesis that rare CNV contributes to syndromic HSCR with unknowngenetic etiology.

It varies from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifesta tions and an increased risk of toxicity from 5  ï¬uorouracil treatment. Materials and Methods: A child with severe autistic behavior, intellectual disability (no speech at 6 years old) and family history   aunt with mental retardation, was referred for genetic counseling. Metabolic screening wasperformed in urine sample by dipstick   glucose, ketone, pH, and reducing sugars, followed by LC MS/MS blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines and GC/MS urine organicacids analysis. Mutations in DPYD gene are reported in DPD de ï¬ciency patients. The gene was investigated by direct Sanger sequencing in proband and his parents. Results: Elevated levels of thymine and uracil were detected by GC/MS urine test which was suggestive of DPD deï¬ciency. Molecular analysis of DPYD gene showed a homozygous splice site mutation c.1905 +1G>A in the proband, inherited from heterozygous parents. Subse  quently, prenatal testing in the family was performed. Thefetus was healthy non carrier. Conclusion: Here we report the ï¬rst Bulgarian patient with severe autistic disorder caused by DPD de ï¬ciency and subsequent prenatal diagnostics performed in the family. As patients with this de ï¬ciency could be easily detected by determination of the thymine uraciluria, screening for thesedefects are indicative for all patients with any autistic behavior and intellectual disability. It also could be useful for those patients who are going to be treated with 5 ï¬uorouracil to prevent lethal toxicities and personalise treatments. M.B. Ivanova: None. V. Jordanova: None. T.

Recently, a study has highlighted LSS associated to hypotrichosis simplex. We expanded the phenotypicspectrum of LSSto a recessive neuroectodermal syndrome formerly named Alopecia with mental retardation (APMR) syndrome. It is a rare autosomal recessive conditioncharacterized by hypotrichosis and intellectual disability (ID) or developmental delay (DD), frequently associated with early onset epilepsy and other dermatological features. Methods: Through a multi center international colla  borative study, we identi ï¬edLSS pathogenic variants in APMR individuals either by exome sequencing or LSS Sanger sequencing. Splicing defects were assessed by transcripts analysis and minigenes assays. Results: We reported 10 APMR individuals from 6 unrelated families with bi allelic variants in LSS.W e additionally identi ï¬ed one affected individual with a single rare variant in LSS and an allelic imbalance suggesting a second event. Among the identi ï¬ed variants, two were truncating, seven were missense and two were splicing variants. Quanti ï¬cation of cholesterol and its precursors did not reveal noticeable imbalance. Conclusion: In the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, the lanosterol synthase leads to the cyclization of (S) 2,3 oxi dosqualene into lanosterol. Our data suggest LSSas a major gene causing a rare recessive neuroectodermal syndrome. T. Besnard: None. N. Sloboda: None. A. Goldenberg: None. S. KÃ¼ry: None. B. CognÃ©: None. F. Breheret: None. E.

Exome sequencing identi ï¬ed in P2 a de novo PTPN11 variant NM_002834.4:c.417G>C p.(E139D) listed aspathogenic in ClinVar and causing Noonan syndrome, which was consistent with the clinical ï¬ndings.

Materials and Methods: In the context of an Interna  tional project aiming at identifying the genetic causes of ASD (Autism Sequencing Consortium, Mount Sinai), weperformed a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis in a cohort of 100 ASD patients, not harboring CNVs, attending the Medical Genetics Unit of Siena. Results: Mutations in already known ASD related genes were detected in 11% of cases, while either de novo or inherited mutations in novel genes were identi ï¬ed in 21% of cases. The novel identi ï¬ed genes can be pooled in three categories: i genes for which causative mutations have not1378been previously reported (eight genes), ii genes for which a likely association with ASD has been previously reported in a single case (eg DRP2 etc) and iii genes whose mutations have been previously associated with intellectual disability (ID) in only one (eg BCORL1 etc) or a few families (eg BRD4 recently associated with a Cornelia De Lange likephenotype etc). Conclusions: Overall, our extensive approach goes beyond safely con ï¬rming the pathogenic role of ASD/ID candidate genes and allows establishing the novel role of ID related genes in ASD. It delineates the impact of new genes across neurodevelopmental dimensions, providingimportant new insights into functional pathways involved in heterogeneous ASD phenotypes. F. Mari: None. C.

In vivo andin vitro studies have shown an important role of the Notch ligand DLL1 in the development of the nervous system and somites, amongothers. We identi ï¬ed 14 individuals from ten unrelated families with heterozygous DLL1 variants by exome sequencing. The most common features in our cohort were intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, seizures and variable brain malformations. Four patients had scoliosis includingone with a vertebral segmentation defect. We identi ï¬ed six nonsense variants, two splice site variants, one missense variant affecting a highly conserved cysteine in the DSLdomain, and one 122 kb deletion containing DLL1 . Ana  lysis of the splice site variant NM_005618.4:c.54 +1G>A showed an in frame insertion of 12 bp near the sequencecoding for the signal peptide, possibly affecting proper localization of the mutant DLL1 protein. The features in our cohort resemble those of patients with overlapping terminaldeletions of 6q27 encompassing DLL1 , supporting the previous hypothesis that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of DLL1 is causative of the phenotype in this deletion. In conclusion, we identi ï¬ed heterozygous mutations in DLL1 in a cohort with a variable neurodevelopmental phenotype and other multi system features. Our clinical andmolecular data support haploinsuf ï¬ciency as a mechanism for the pathogenesis of DLL1  related disorders and illustrate the importance of DLL1 in human brain development.

We investigated 26 individuals with CHD8 protein truncating variants (PTVs), including 10 previously unreported patients, and found a1380pattern of common features: macrocephaly (76%), tall stature (65%), developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD/ID, 81%), autism spectrum disorders (ASD, 81%), sleep dif ï¬culties (48%), gastrointestinal problems (42%), and distinct facial features. The gestalt is reminiscent of Sotos and Weaver syndromes. Most of the individuals inour cohort had moderate to severe intellectual disability, and some had regression of speech (37%), seizures (27%) and hypotonia (27%), and two individuals were also non ambulant. Most individuals had ASD (81%), similarly to previous studies, but we found a higher incidence of comorbid neurodevelopmental delay/impairment. Our studyshows that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of CHD8 is associated with a Sotos like syndrome with pronounced autistic traits. S. Douzgou: None. H. Liang: None. K. Metcalfe: None. S. Somarathi: None. M.

Recently, de novo variants affecting the amino acid p.Arg87 of CYFIP2Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1383were reported in four individuals with epileptic encephalo  pathy. We here report 12 independent patients harboring a variety of de novo variants in CYFIP2 broadening the molecular and clinical spectrum of a novel CYFIP2  related neurodevelopmental disorder. Using trio whole exome or  genome sequencing, we identi ï¬ed 12 independent patients carrying a total of eight distinct de novo variants in CYFIP2 with a shared phenotype of intellectual disability, seizures, and muscular hypotonia. We detected seven differentmissense variants, of which two occurred recurrently (p. (Arg87Cys) and p.(Ile664Met)), and a splice donor variant in the last intron for which we showed exon skipping in thetranscript. The latter is expected to escape nonsense  mediated mRNA decay resulting in a truncated protein. Despite the large spacing in the primary structure, thevariants spatially cluster in the tertiary structure and are all predicted to weaken the interaction with WAVE1 or NCKAP1 of the actin polymerization regulating WRC complex. Preliminary genotype âphenotype correlation indi  cates a profound phenotype in p.Arg87 substitutions and a more variable phenotype in other alterations. This studyevidenced a variety of de novo variants in CYFIP2 as a novel cause of mostly severe intellectual disability with seizures and muscular hypotonia. M. Zweier: None. A. Begemann: None. K.

The majority of reported patients harbored de novo loss of function (LoF) variants. To date, the phenotype of only four patients has been precisely described in the literature, contrasting with the relative frequency of detection of such LoF GATAD2B variants. Here, we describe 10 patients with con ï¬rmed LoF GATAD2B variants and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Methods: Patients were included by contacting referent clinicians from several French genetics departments. Results: Developmental delay was severe with a median age of 2.4 years (range [2 5]) for independent walking and of 2.75 years (range [1 4]) for ï¬rst spoken words. They showed very little subsequent progress, one patientremaining non verbal at age 30 years. ID was mostly moderate, with only one severe and one mild case, which differs from the original description of severe ID. Mostcommon dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, downturned mouth and, anomalies of the extremities. Conversely, prenatal compli cations, non cerebral organ malformations, epilepsy and autistic behaviour were very rare. One patient presented asthma and recurrent respiratory infections, another onepresented severe feeding dif ï¬culties and developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and IgG de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: NGS based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of GATAD2B variations. Better knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for a cor  rect interpretation of the molecular results and for anaccurate management of these patients. G. Vera: None. A. Sorlin: None. G.

It had been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, based on its deletion in Potocki Shaffer syndrome (PSS) interval at 11p11.2 and its disruption in three patients with balanced translocations. However, until now, individuals who carry deleterioussequence variants within PHF21A have not been identi ï¬ed. Moreover, the identity of a novel gene underlying hypotonia or neurobehavioral phenotype at 11p11.2remained cryptic. Here, we describe seven individuals who carry heterozygous intragenic sequence variants in PHF21A: a missense variant, which alters the last nucleotide of an exon, four frameshift variants, and two identical nonsense variants. These variants are predicted totrigger nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or generate a truncated version of PHF21A. This con ï¬rms that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of PHF21A causes not only intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, but also epilepsy, language delay, hypotonia, and neurobehavioral problems. We also found that PHF21A is profoundly expressed inhuman fetal brain and skeletal muscle. This emphasizes the role of PHF21A in early human development, which is consistent with developmental delay, autism, ADHD,epilepsy, and hypotonia observed at an early age in our patients. These ï¬ndings de ï¬nitely provide proof of the pathogenicity of this gene in a syndromic form ofintellectual disability. Furthermore, our studies suggest additional features, in particular autism, which extend the phenotypic spectrum attributable to PHF21A mutations. H. Kim: None. J.A. Rosenfeld: None. D.A.

Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Bainbridge ropers syndrome (BRPS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in ASXL3 . Patients with BRPS show delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, speech alterations, hypotonia, poor growth and dysmorphic features. It is categorized as a syndromic cause of Autism spectrumdisorder (ASD). Nowadays, 33 patients with BRPS have been reported. Our work expands the mutational spectrum of the ASXL3 with the genotype phenotype characterizing 11 new patients. Material and Methods: In a collaborative initiative we have identi ï¬ed 11 patients with neurodevelopmental dis  orders and ASD phenotype with loss of function(LoF) mutations in the ASXL3 gene. Exome sequencing was used as a diagnostic tool and Sanger sequencing was used forfamilial segregation. The mutational spectrum of ASXL3 was revised in public_data (PubMed, Clinvar, SFARI). Results: We identi ï¬ed 10 new ASXL3 LoF variants and one recurrent mutation (c.3106C>T;p.Arg1036Ter). The main clinical characteristics of our patients included moderate severe intellectual disability with ASD traits andneuroconductual disorder including aggressively behavior in adolescence. Dysmorphic features highly suggestive of ASXL3 were delineated eyebrows and the skeletal pheno  type. So far, 77 different LoF mutations (48 frameshifts, 28 Stop Gain, 1 splicing) have been identi ï¬ed including our present results. There are 3 recurrent mutations and 73unique variants. Conclusions: The inclusion of new patients with BRPS increases the knowledge of mutational spectrum of ASXL3 and is essential to further delineate the phenotype of this syndrome. The recognition of this syndrome in the context of a neurodevelopmental disorder is indispensable for theorientation of molecular diagnosis. Grant: FIS_FEDER_PI16/00369; PERIS SLT002/16/ 00174 I.

Parrend3, J. L. Mandel1 1IGBMC, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France,2Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands,3iCube laboratory, Strasbourg, France Introduction: About 50 recurrent CNVs and 800 genes are implicated in genetic forms of intellectual disability (ID) with or without autism (ASD). The extreme heterogeneityof these neurodevelopmental disorders and the rarity of identi ï¬ed cases for many of the implicated genes renders the goal of de ï¬ning the clinical spectrum, comorbidities and natural history a daunting task. We reasoned that a participatory approach would be a relevant alternative and used the Koolen deVries syndrome (KdvS   17q21.31del /KANSL1mut) for a proof of concept.1400Methods and Results: We initiated GENIDA, a partici  patory online cohort study for speci ï¬c genetic causes of ID/ ASD ( https://genida.unistra.fr ), whereby clinical informa  tion is entered and updated by the family of the proband using a structured online questionnaire currently available in 5 languages, with answers from 650 participatingfamilies. The KdVS cohort is the largest, with 179 partici  pating families. Results obtained for the frequency of behavioral problems, epilepsy or other previously reportedcomorbidities are consistent with published data. Our approach allowed us to re ï¬ne frequencies of speci ï¬c man  ifestations and their perceived severity. Inclusion of pro bands from a wide age range generates data on natural history. A major ï¬nding is the identi ï¬cation of recurrent respiratory problems in 40% of patients, including asthma(30 cases) and pneumonia (17 cases, mostly before 10y) that appear uncorrelated with reported laryngo/tracheoma  lacia or immunologic problems. Conclusion: Data comparisons show that parents of patients can adequately answer the questionnaire, and validate our participatory approach. The ï¬nding of novel and relevant comorbidities has now to be translated in improved healthcare. F.P. Colin: None. D.A. Koolen: None. N. Collot: None. T. Mazzucotelli: None. P. Parrend: None. J.L.

The protein interacts with FMRP and the gene has high constraint to loss of functionvariation (gnomAD: 0 variants observed / 58 expected). Three de novo loss of function PRR12 variants and one translocation disrupting the gene have been reported in theliterature in patients showing global developmental delay, intellectual disability, neuropsychiatric problems, eye and vision abnormalities, dysmorphic features, hypotonia,skeletal abnormalities, sleep problems and anxiety. Three other de novo PRR12 variants have been identi ï¬ed in large studies in additional patients from whom no or only limitedphenotype information is available. We describe a 3 year old boy referred for developmental delay, failure to thrive and congenital hypotonia. His facial features included short forehead, bilateral epicanthal folds, hooded upper eyelids, malar hypoplasia, and borderline small asymmetric low set ears. He also showed anxiety andautistic traits, and had pes planus and tapered digits. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous PRR121402nonsense variant NM_020719.2(PRR12):c.3958C>T, p. (Arg1320*) which was absent from all databases. The facial phenotype was consistent with previously reported cases, except that no signi ï¬cant abnormalities in structure and function of the eyes were present. Our ï¬ndings support the role of PRR12 haploinsuf ï¬  ciency in a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, and show, in accord with several other cases, that the eye phenotype originally described as a part of the typical presentation maybe absent.

The role of TLK2 in brain is still unknown. Within the Autism Sequencing Con sortium (ASC) project, we identi ï¬ed new patients with variants in the TLK2 gene by whole exome sequencing (WES). Methods: DNA samples from trios were sequenced at the Broad Institute on Illumina HiSeq sequencers as previouslydescribed (De Rubeis et al., 2014); variant calling was performed using a bioinformatics pipeline adapted for dif  ferent patterns of inheritance. Results: We identi ï¬ed one patient with a de novo likely pathogenic TLK2 variant (p.Asp529Gly) and a family with three siblings who inherited a nonsense variant from anaffected mother (p.Glu453*). Finally, we report a de novo 39 kb deletion encompassing the TLK2 and MRC2 genes. Clinical phenotypes partially overlapped with known cases:facial dysmorphisms were present in all patients, while intellectual disability and microcephaly were not identi ï¬ed in the patient with the 39 kb deletion, where the skeletalanomalies were predominant. Conclusion: Our study describes 6 new cases from 3 families with TLK2 associated disease. Our data support therecent report that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of this gene is involved in heterogeneous forms of intellectual disability. L. Pavinato: None. E. Giorgio: None. V. Antona: None. D.

Materials and Methods: We present data on exome , genome sequencing, and array analysis of thirteen indivi  duals that point to pathogenic, heterozygous, mostly de novo variants in WDFY3 (signi ï¬cant de novo enrichment p,0.0007) as a monogenic cause of mild and non  speciï¬cN D D . Results: Nine variants were protein truncating and four missense. Overlapping symptoms included NDD, intellec  tual disability (ID), macrocephaly, and psychiatric disorders (ASD/ADHD). One proband presented with an opposingphenotype of microcephaly and the only missense variant located in PH domain of WDFY3. Findings of this case are supported by previously published data demonstrating thatpathogenic PH domain variants can lead to microcephaly via canonical Wnt pathway up regulation. We previously reported that Wdfy3 is required for cere  bral cortical size regulation in mice, by controlling proper division of neural progenitors. Here, we show that pro  liferating cortical neural progenitors of human embryonicbrains highly express WDFY3, further supporting a role in regulation of prenatal neurogenesis. We present data on Wnt pathway dysregulation in Wdfy3 haploinsuf ï¬cient mice, which display macrocephaly and de ï¬cits in motor coordination and associative learning, recapitulating thehuman phenotype. Consequently, we propose that in humans WDFY3 loss of function variants lead to macro  cephaly via down regulation of the Wnt pathway. Conclusion: We present WDFY3 as a novel gene linked to mild to moderate NDD and ID and conclude that variants putatively causing haploinsuf ï¬ciency lead to macrocephaly, while an opposing pathomechanism due to variants in PH  domain of WDFY3 leads to microcephaly.

451,A Autism monozygotic twins with APBA2 gene duplication vary for tick development,P09.018,,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is neurological and developmental disorder that begins earlyin childhood and lasts throughout a person's life, character  ized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and non verbal communication. Large genome rearrangements are being identi ï¬ed in ASD as an under  lying cause for development of this syndrome. These rearrangements are mostly deletions, but duplications canbe found. We present case of twin boys with APBA2 gene duplication. Materials and Methods: Twin boys, age 9 were referred to genetic counseling and testing with diagnosed ASD (DSM IV). DNA was isolated from buccal swabs of the boys, and 3 ml of whole blood from parents. Parents pro vided completed questionnaires for tick disorders in chil  dren as well as Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ). Identi ï¬cation of mutations was made with MLPA (multiplex ligase dependent probe ampli ï¬cation) technique, with MLPA kits P343 and P339 (Mrc Holland). Results: All samples were typed successfully. We iden  tiï¬ed de novo APBA2 gene duplication in both twins. This gene, located on 15q13.1 locus is already associated with autism features. DCDQ scores are similar in twins withindication of DCD. Assessment of the Questionnaires for tick disorders in children revealed that one sibling is com  pletely absent for ticks while other has high score for sec tion related to vocal and involuntary ticks. Conclusions: This ï¬nding require further investigation and follow up on spatial and temporal differences in autismassociated traits in APBA2 gene duplication associated autism. N.

Materials and Methods: For this study we used MLPA P245 Microdeletion Syndromes for screening of the most common microdeletion syndromes and MLPA P036 Sub  telomeres Mix 1 for screening of subtelomeric deletions/duplications in 198 patients with autism spectrum disorders. To con ï¬rm alternations discovered with MLPA P036 Subtelomeres Mix 1 we used MLPA P070 SubtelomeresMix 2B. Results: We identi ï¬ed 12 autistic patients with sub  microscopic aberrations. There were 2 patients with sub telomeric deletion at the 14q and 2q regions respectively. Two patients had the same deletion at the 1p36.33 region. One patient had a submicroscopic deletion at the 6q regionand duplication at the 13q region simultaneously. Two patients had the submicroscopic deletions at the 4q region. Three duplications were detected at 3p, 9p, and 17p11.2regions. Two patients were with deletion at the 8p and 22q11.21 regions respectively.

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes.We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi  duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%). CYP2D6 metabo  lizes most psychoactive drugs, while CYP1A1 acts on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of endocrine disrupting chemi cals (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A). Early exposure to neurotoxic phthalates, bisphenol A and PAHs has been previously associated with ASD risk, and here we provideevidence for an effect of gene environmental exposure interaction mediated by CYP450 gene variants.

The nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway is essential to control mRNA quality and has an important role in the regulation of thetranscriptome. Mutations in genes involved in the NMD pathway, such as the UPF3B gene, a core component of this pathway, were previously linked to ASD. In this study weexplored the potential role of other NMD factors in ASD. We generated a list of 153 genes involved in the NMD pathway using AmiGO, Reactome and a systematic litera ture review. To identify potentially pathogenic variants in the NMD genes, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data (WES) data from 1338 ASD subjects. We also searched forCopy Number Variants (CNVs) targeting NMD genes in ASD patients (n ,3570) and checked their frequency in controls (n ,9649). We identi ï¬ed 43 high impact variants in 28 NMD genes, including the UPF3B and ACE, two genes previously implicated in ASD. Importantly, 11 were novel candidategenes that carry loss of function and missense (deleterious and damaging) variants with a frequency of 1 to 5% in this ASD dataset. Additionally, 5 NMD genes were found to betargeted by CNVs in 12 ASD subjects but none of the controls.

Nowakowska1 1Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland, 2MEDGEN, Warsaw, Poland Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a heterogenous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by problems in social interaction and communication as well as thepresence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviour. It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD. We elected to use oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 275 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high  resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non  polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k).

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post  treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together. Conclusion: Autistic individuals with higher genetic burden for the disorder, including large rare CNVs andhigher load of PRS, have different bene ï¬ts of SSGT com  pared with individuals with lower genetic risk.

While its etiology is unknown, the large assemblage ofrisk variants impacting calcium ion channels and signaling proteins suggest that a functional disruption of this signaling hub may be involved in ASD pathogenesis. Inthis study, we evaluate how such risk variants exert their deleterious effects in a unique ASD case.We identi ï¬ed this subject in a previous study where we observed signi ï¬ cant changes in the single channel inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor kinetics of ASD ï¬broblasts via âoptical patch clamp âand found that this feature could be visualized with a high throughput Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) screening assay as a decrease incalcium release from the ER. This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore. To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com  pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases. The subject âs transcriptome showed increased expression (>5sd) of genes including the ATP2A3 calcium pump and purinergic receptors, and extremely lowexpression (>24sd) of VDAC2, a mitochondrial calcium uptake channel.

458,A Establishing genotype phenotype associations for ASD,P09.026,,"Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) has hindered the establishment of genotype phenotype associations. Herein, we presented a novel approach that integrates semantic similarity andunsupervised machine learning methods to dissect the ASD genotypic heterogeneity and to identify phenotypic mani  festations of ASD genetic variants. This approach wasapplied to copy number variants (N ,6650), disrupting 3998 genes from 1119 ASD patients. Functional similarities among genes were computed using Resnik semanticsimilarity measure. Semantic similarity score, ranging from 0 to 1 represents the functional similarity between two genes, where 1 represents identical genes while score 0reï¬ects functionally dissimilar genes. Agglomerative hier  archical clustering of the computed gene similarity matrix identi ï¬ed four different clusters of functionally related genes. Silhouette analysis indicated that clusters were compact and consistent (average Silhouette value ,0.31). The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD. Cluster 1 genes were also most signiï¬cantly enriched for Schizophrenia Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term, which is a co occurring condition with ASD. The other three clusters were not enriched for ASD related HPO terms. The results indicated thatphenotypic genotypic associations can established for ASD by reducing its genotypic heterogeneity i.e. clustering of functionally similar genes. However, to associate theseclusters with phenotype, further efforts are required to enrich HPO resource. (Grant reference: PTDC/CCI BIO/ 28685/2017) A.C.G. IlhÃ©u: None. M. Asif: None. F.M.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func  tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal  ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse  quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations.

Material and Methods: We used microarray data from probands with ASD (n ,2926) and their unaffected siblings (n,2434) from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). CNVs were called, validated, and subsequently ï¬ltered using established pipelines and detection algorithms (PennCNV, QuantiSNP, SnipPeep).

Vincent1 1Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada,2Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,3Queen âs University,, Kingston, ON, Canada, 4University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Worcester, MA, United States Introduction: Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein, playing a critical role in multiple processes, including ribosome assembly and maturation, chromatin decondensa tion, and pre rRNA transcription. Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p.Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen  cing of an autism spectrum disorder trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C  terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis  localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p.Gly664*, shows a very similar effect on the location of the NCL protein, thus con ï¬rming the presence of the nucleolar location signal of NCL protein in this region. FRAP showssigniï¬cant changes in the kinetics and mobility of mutant NCL protein in the nucleoplasm. Conclusions: Several other studies have also reported de novo mutations in NCL in ASD or neurodevelopmental dis  orders. Altered mislocalization and dynamics of mutant NCL (p.G664Glufs*70/ p.G664*) may have relevance to the etio pathlogy of NCL related neurodevelopmental phenotypes. T.I. Sheikh: None. N. Vasli: None.

Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Madrid, SpainIntroduction: The Spanish Undiagnosed Rare Diseases Program (SpainUDP) performs extended genetic analyses and deep phenotyping to get a de ï¬nite diagnosis in rare syndrome cases. We present the case of a 3 year old male with severe generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness together with neurodevelopmental delay. He presentsmicrocephaly and dysmorphic features highlighting micro  retrognathy, low set ears and hypertelorism. Materials and Methods: Trio based exome analysis was carried out by using Nextera Truseq Rapid Enrichment kit and sequenced in NextSeq500 (Illumina). Results: The exome analysis revealed a novel mutation consisting on a small de novo 30 bp deletion in exon 9 of AUTS2 gene (Autism susceptibility candidate 2, OMIM:607270), which allowed the diagnosis of this patientas AUTS2 Syndrome or Mental Retardation, autosomal dominant 26 (OMIM:615834). AUTS2 gene is involved in the development of neurological disorders. Alterations ofAUTS2 gene were described as a result of genomic rear  rangements, although large copy number variations and intragenic deletions or mutations have also been describedto cause this syndrome. It is noteworthy that the deletion found in this patient included the transcription start site of the short isoform of the gene, which plays an important rolein brain development. The gene expression analysis showed that the deletion causes reduction in the level of expression not only of the short isoform but also of the completetranscript of the gene. Conclusions: This case helps in establishing the genotype phenotype correlation adding more evidence tothe role of mutations speci ï¬cally affecting the short isoform for the development of a severe phenotype.

481,D Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia with ï¬rst homozygous duplication in GRID2 and review of the literature,P09.053,,"M. Arslan5, H. Topalo Älu6 1Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University, Ankara Ataturk Training and Research Hospital, Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara, Turkey,2Karadeniz Technical University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Neurology,Trabzon, Turkey, 3Ankara Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara, Turkey,4Gulhane Training and Research Hospital, Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara, Turkey, 5Gulhane Training and Research Hospital, Department of Child Neurology, Ankara, Turkey,6Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Child Neurology, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias are characterized by abnormal structure of the cerebellum and spinal cord. GRID2 is involved in ataxia through both loss of function mutations and gain of function mutations due to respective deletions and missense variations. Here, we report the identi ï¬cation and characterisation of a novel ARCA caused by bi allelic duplication of GRID2 in two siblings. Methods: Illuminia Â®Truesight One clinical exome was performed on one of the siblings with MiSeq next âgenera  tion sequencing platform. Whereas chromosomal micro  array analysis was performed on the entire family by usingAfï¬metrix Optima Â®chips. Variants were evaluated based on the phenotype and standard in silico tools. Results: No disease causing mutations were reported as a result of the clinical exome test.Chromosomal microarray analysis showed a ~121 kb homozygous duplication of GRID2 (chr4:94,447,511 94,569,021), including exon 14,in two siblings. Conclusion: Previously there has been reports of homo  zygous deletions and missense mutations of GRID2, but ourstudy is the ï¬rst one to identify a homozygous duplication of the gene. This mutation, which segregated in two siblings with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia, will help usunderstand the effect of the exon 14 of GRID2 on the phenotype and the structure of the GluRD2 protein. These ï¬ndings provide us with the conclusion that chromosomal microarray should be the ï¬rst step of the diagnostic process of autosomal recessive ataxia types. A. Ceylan: None. E.

Nadif Kasri1,2,3 1Department of Human Genetics, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Netherlands,2Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, Netherlands,3Department of Cognitive Neurosciences, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Netherlands The brain is a complex neural network that requires a precisely tuned interplay of excitatory and inhibitory signals in order to function. Disruptions in synaptic connectivity, inparticular the balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I), have been shown to underlie neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, the mechanisms underlyingthis coordination remain elusive. One gene that is implicated NDDs is Cadherin 13 (CDH13 ). Dysregulations ofCDH13 have been linked to attention de ï¬cit/hyperactiv  ity disorder and comorbid disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Studies in mice showed that Cdh13 localises at the inhibitory presynapse, and when knocked out leads toincreased inhibitory drive onto hippocampal CA1 pyrami  dal neurons. However, the mechanism by which CDH13 regulates the function of inhibitory synapses in humanneurons remains unknown. To understand the function of CDH13 in human neurons, we generated both GABAergic and Glutamatergic neurons via controlled differentiation ofInduced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hIPSC). Using RNA interference we reduced CDH13 expression in GABAergic neurons. We investigated neuronal network communicationby means of Micro Electrode Arrays, whereas on a single  cell level, inhibitory synaptic transmission was assessed using whole cell patch clamp recordings. Our data showsthat CDH13 knockdown in human GABAergic neurons increases inhibitory control on glutamatergic neurons recorded by MEA. Moreover, cell adhesion assay revealedthat ITG Î²1 and ITG Î²3 play an opposite role in the regulation of inhibitory synaptic strength via interaction with CDH13. In summary, these results point towards animportant role for CDH13 in inhibitory synapses via CDH13 ITG Î²1/ITG Î²3 interaction, which could be critical in the maintenance of the E/I balance. B.

485,A Understanding the role of HNRNPU in braindevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders,P09.058,,"S. BÃ¶lte1, A. Falk3, K. Tammimies1 1Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (KIND), Karolinska Institute, Solna, Sweden,2Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institute, Solna, Sweden,3Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden Background: Mutations affecting HNRNPU (Heteroge  neous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U) located on chr1q44 have been described in individuals with various neurode  velopmental disorders. HNRNPU is one of the componentsof the spliceosome and shown to regulate the 3D genome organization. However, the role of HNRNPU in neuronal development has not been characterized. Material and Methods: Induced pluripotent stem cells from controls and individuals with HNRPU mutations will be used to investigate its role in neuronal development.HNRNPU expression is measured during the early stages of the neuronal differentiation using the neuroepithelial stem cell like (NES) model followed with detailed investigationsof the 3D genome organization, transcriptomics including splicing patterns and DNA/RNA targets of HNRNPU using high throughput methods. Results: We have identi ï¬ed a monozygotic twin pair with severe ID, autism and epilepsy carrying a ~44.3Kb het  erozygous deletion of HNRNPU and COX20. The expres  sion of HNRNPU in NES cells was con ï¬rmed to be reduced ~50% due to the deletion as expected. In control cell lines, theHNRNPU expression was reduced upon neuronal dif  ferentiation, however similar pattern was not seen in the deletion carrier. We are currently investigating the early time points of neuronal differentiation and how the multipleroles of HNRNPU are connected to the typical and atypical trajectories of the neuronal development using multiple omics methods. Conclusions: Reduction of HNRNPU levels interfere with differentiation at an early phase of neuronalcommitment. Our study will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that could underlie the NDDs associated with HNRNPU mutations and 1q44 deletions. F. Mastropasqua: None. I. Rabkina: None. M. Becker: None. B.

SantamarÃ­a, C. Ruiz, J. GarcÃ­a Planells, M. GarcÃ­a Hoyos Instituto de Medicina GenÃ³mica (IMEGEN), Valencia, Spain Identi ï¬cation of the genetic aetiology of intellectual disability (ID) or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)provides bene ï¬ts, like speci ï¬c genetic counselling, more accurate prognosis and specialized treatment. The world  wide average prevalence of ASDs is 1 in 160 children and1 3% of ID. Due to the genetic heterogeneity of these pathologies different genetic tests are available. Today,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1439chromosomal microarray is the ï¬rst tier recommended diagnostic test and provides a yield around 10 15% for ID patients and around 9% for ASDs patients, depending on the cohort. Our goal is to evaluate if the diagnostic yield estimated by targeted sequencing in our cohorts of ID or ASDs subjects is higher than that obtained by CGH array.We screened 701 in house selected ID related genes and 189 autism related genes in a cohort of more than 100 and 60 patients, respectively. Libraries were prepared withdifferent capture kits and the Illumina NextSeq500 platform was used to sequence targeted regions. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with an in house pipeline. Thediagnostic yield was 41% in the ID cohort and 20% in the ASDs cohort. Variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 50% of the ID patients and 72% of the autism patients and negative results were obtained in 9% and 8% of the ID and autism individuals, respectively. ID or autism  related genes sequencing provide higher diagnostic yieldsthan CGH array. Furthermore, copy number variants evaluation could be performed simultaneously with our pipeline. For this reason, we proposed targeted sequencingas the ï¬rst tier genetic test for ID and autism diagnosis. M. PeÃ±a Vilabelda: A.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT  qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail  able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers.Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange  ment.

Sanchez Bolivar, M. Carcajona, P. Maietta, S. Alvarez NIMGenetics, Madrid, Spain Introduction: Exome trio analysis is an effective strategy to identify potential causal variants in rare genetic disorders with clinical heterogeneity. In this study, we focused on the 404 probands with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD)with causal variants on chromatin regulating genes to determine their frequency and their genotypic/phenotypic characteristics by trio analysis. Patients and Methods: A cohort of 259 males and 145 females, with a median of 7 years old, was studied by trio whole exome sequencing. Libraries were generated with IonAmpliSeq TMor SureSelectXTand sequenced with IonAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1449ProtonTM/S5TMXL or NovaSeq 6000. The data were pro  cessed using an in house pipeline. Results: A genetic diagnosis was established in 129 of the 404 studied probands, leading to a diagnostic yield of 32%. Among the positive cases, 82 and 47 variants, were considered as casual or probably casual, respectively. Ofthat diagnosed patients cohort, 26 probands (20%) had variants in chromatin regulating genes (ARID1B, ATRX, EHMT1, SATB2, SMARCA2, and KMT family). Of the 26variants identi ï¬ed, 58% were loss of function de novo variants associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance. Clinically, these patients shared NDDs phenotypic char acteristics (psychomotor delay and/or autism spectrum dis  order) with short stature, dysmorphic features, epilepsy and/ or digital malformations. Conclusions: The haploinsuf ï¬ciency associated with loss of function variants in the genes implicated in the regulation of chromatin played a crucial role in neurodevelopmentdisorders. These deleterious variants seemed to be asso  ciated with a common phenotype. A better delineation of these clinical manifestations could help to better recognizethem in the clinical setting. I.

Materials and Methods: An eight year old girl born from a non consanguineous couple, presented a progressive motor sensory axonal polyneuropathy and subsequentlydeveloped cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia and cognitive decline. She underwent SMN1 deletion testing, NMD gene panel analysis and a trio WES. Results: WES led to the identi ï¬cation of a de novo c.1535C>T variant (p.Pro512Leu) in the CAPRIN1 (Cell Cycle Associated Protein 1) gene. This variant is not presentin 1000G and gnomAD. CAPRIN1 has reduced tolerance to missense (Z ,1.79) and is intolerant to nonsense variants (pLI,1.0). CAPRIN1 is abundant in the adult brain, where it regulates the transport and translation of mRNAs of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Moreover, it contains an LC/ ID domain and it is a component of stress granules.Mutations in proteins containing LC/ID domains (TDP43, TIA1, hnRNPA1/2) cause MNDs and increase the like  lihood of protein aggregates formation. Several in silico tools predict that the p.P512L mutation to increase the aggregation propensity. Indeed, experiments in HEK293T cells show that CAPRIN1 P512Lforms bulky aggregates as compared to CAPRIN1WT. Moreover, an insoluble protein extraction assay demonstrates that CAPRIN1WTelutes in the RIPA soluble fraction while CAPRIN1P512Lin the urea soluble one. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CAPRIN1P512Lis prone to aggregation.

Studies correlat ing EEG and neuroimaging with speci ï¬c FASD categories are lacking. Material and methods: Classi ï¬cation of 62 patients into 3 FASD categories, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS) and alcohol related neurodeve  lopmental disorders (ARND). Prospective studies of MRimaging and EEG. Results: Neuroimaging: The most frequent ï¬ndings were corpus callosum abnormalities (42%) and cerebellar vermishypoplasia (24%). Additional ï¬ndings were vascular anomalies, gliosis, prominent perivascular spaces, occipito  cervical junction and cervical vertebral anomalies, pituitaryhypoplasia, arachnoid cysts, and cavum septum pellucidum. Only 16% had normal neuroimaging. EEG (including sleep recording in 43%) showed anomalies in 23%, includingslowing of background activity and interictal epileptiform discharges, focal and/or generalized, and 3 of them had epilepsy. In one patient, seizures were ï¬rst detected during the EEG recording and one case had an encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES). Focal interictal discharges in our patients did not imply thepresence of underlying visible focal brain lesions in the neuroimaging studies, such as cortical dysplasia or poly  microgyria. However, they had nonspeci ï¬c brain MR abnormalities, including corpus callosum hypoplasia, ver  mis hypoplasia or cavum septum pellucidum.

Gemelli, IRCCS, UniversitÃ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy,11University Medical Center Hamburg  Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Introduction: Aberrant activation or inhibition of potas  sium (K +) currents across the plasma membrane of cells has been causally linked to altered various functions in both excitable and non excitable cells. KCNK4 belongs to the mechano gated ion channels of the TRAAK/TREK sub family of two pore domain (K2P) K +channels. While K2P channels are well known to contribute to the resting membrane potential/cellular excitability, their involvementin pathophysiological processes remains largely uncharacterized. Materials and Methods: In the frame of the Undiag  nosed Patients Program at the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino GesÃ¹, Rome, the exomes of two unrelated subjects with a molecularly unexplained, clinically superimposable pheno type were scanned to identify the underlying molecular cause. Patch clamp analyses, co expression experiments and molecular dynamics simulations were used to func tionally characterized the genomic ï¬ndings. Results: Two variants in KCNK4 were identi ï¬ed as the only shared events in these two patients and a third wasfound by using GeneMatcher. Patch clamp analyses docu  mented an impressive gain of function of the identi ï¬ed KCNK4 channel mutants. Co expression experiments pro vided evidence of the dominant behavior of the disease  causing mutations. Remarkably, molecular dynamics simulations consistently indicated that mutations seal thelateral intramembrane fenestration proposed to negatively control K +ï¬ow.Conclusions: We report that de novo missense mutations inKCNK4 cause a recognizable syndrome for which we propose the acronym FHEIG (facial dysmorphism, hyper  trichosis, epilepsy, intellectual disability/developmental delay, and gingival overgrowth). Overall, our ï¬ndings illustrate the pleiotropic effect of dysregulated KCNK4function and provide support to the hypothesis of a gating mechanism based on the lateral fenestrations of K2P channels.

613,C Intragenic de novo frame shift deletion of two exon conï¬rms a role for FNDC3B in human craniofacial development and possibly neuro psychiatric development,P11.35,,"M. Sommerlund1, L. Graversen1, M. F. Boxill2, U. B. Jensen1 1Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus N, Denmark, 2Regional Hospital Midt, Viborg, Denmark Background: De novo 3q26.31 microdeletions has been reported in four cases with dysmorphic facial features. The overlapping deleted region was shown to only contain the FNDC3B gene. The product of this gene, the ï¬bronectin domain III containing protein 3B (also known as factor for adipocyte differentiation 104 (FAD104)) has been identi  ï¬ed in mouse models as a positive regulator of adipocytes differentiation but also as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Cranial changes have also been described forFNDC3B knock out mice. Methods: Agilent 180K oligo array CGH analysis and clinical evaluation including a neurodevelopmental evaluation. Results: We report the ï¬rst case of a de novo intragenic microdeletion involving two exons of the FNDC3B gene resulting in an frameshift deletion. The patient is a boy withsubtle dysmorphic facial features and behavioral problemsAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1505within the autism spectrum. The boy is 9 years old and we present the developmental evaluation at different ages. Conclusion: CNVs have contributed much to our understanding of disease development and the underlying mechanism. However, the role of individual genes in dis  ease development can be dif ï¬cult to interpret in cases where the deletion includes more genes or expands beyond the boundaries of a single gene. Such deletions may include crucial elements that affects the 3 dimensional structure ofthe genome and therefore affects the function of several genes in the region. This is the ï¬rst case with an intragenic exon deletion in FNDC3B supporting a role for this gene in both craniofacial development and neuro psychiatric development. I.K. YstrÃ¸m: None. R.

632,B New recurrent 2q12.2q12.3 microdeletion involving ST6GAL2 gene in a boy with neurological phenotype,P11.54,,"Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy Recurrent microdeletion and microduplication syndromes are among the most common causes of human neurodeve  lopmental and psychiatric disorders. These reciprocalgenomic disorders often result from non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between near identical segmental duplications. Copy number changes mediated by segmentalduplications may be either pathogenic or may exist as benign variants in the human population. However, almost all pathogenic CNVs are characterized by a range of phenotypic outcomes (variable expressivity) and by unaffected family members who carry the same CNV (incomplete penetrance). Here we report a boy withmild intellectual disability, speech delay, and hypotonia presenting a 1.56 Mb interstitial deletion at 2q12.2 12.3 inherited from his healthy father. The microdeletionincludes three OMIM genes, of which ST6GAL2 , in our opinion, is the most interesting. This gene encodes a beta  galactoside alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase expressed in brainand its transcription could be potentially activated for spe  ciï¬c neuronal functions. In the literature four cases have been reported with microdeletions/microduplications com prising ST6GAL2 gene and associated with neurological diseases. In DECIPHER database seventeen individuals have been identi ï¬ed with deletions similar to that of our case and neurological disease as intellectual disability, delayed speech, autism. Ten patients inherited the deletion from an apparently unaffected parent. It is interesting tonote that all these microdeletions are very similar in extension and are possibly mediated by NAHR. In conclusion, we describe a new recurrent microdeletion 2q12.2 12.3 containing the ST6GAL2 gene, which may be a signiï¬cant and independent risk factor for neurological diseases acting in association with other factors to modifyneurological phenotypes.

In many patients hypotelorism and mild skeletal anomalies in the hands or feet have been reported. No causative gene of SR/BRSS has been found to date. We present the clinical characteristics of two boys with severe developmental delay and dysmorphic features suggestive of SR/BRSS. In both,blepharophimosis, cleft or high arched palate, hypospadias, scoliosis, and arachnodactyly with clinodactyly were observed. Additionally microcephaly, arched eyebrow, highnarrow nasal bridge, long hanging columella, micrognathia, hypoplastic earlobes, hypermobile joints have been noted. The same novel de novo mutation, HNRNPH1 c.616C>T (p.Arg206Trp), was found in both patients using whole exome sequencing. To date, mutations in the highly conserved autosomal HNRNPH1 gene have not been associated with human disease. HNRNPH1 belongs to the group of nuclear ribonucleoproteins involved in regulation of pre mRNAs splicing. Interestingly, the identical recurrentmutation affecting the small domain encoding nuclear localization signal in the highly paralogous HNRNPH2 gene has been previously associated with X linked, syndromic,Bain type mental retardation [MRXSB, OMIM #300986]. MRXSB has been identi ï¬ed in females with developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, hypotonia, and sei zures. Only in single cases hypotelorism, small palpebral ï¬ssures, or elongated ï¬ngers were observed. Although defective function of HNRNPH2 and HNRNPH1 proteinshave similar clinical consequences in regards to intellectual disability, mutations in HNRNPH1 gene may represent a distinct syndrome perhaps related or identical to Schilbach Rott/Blepharofacioskeletal Syndrome.

Traeger Synodinos1 1Department of Medical Genetics, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece,2Genotypos Science Labs MSA, Athens, Greece Introduction: We report 12 months of clinical NGS by the Department of Medical Genetics, Athens University, and a collaborating service lab, for patients referred for a widerange of genetic conditions. Material and Methods: During 12 months, 186 patients (85% pediatric) were referred, following clinical evaluation,pre test counselling and signed informed consent. Clinical geneticists and other medical specialists selected whole or clinical exome sequencing (~19,000 or ~4,500 genes)according to phenotype. Library preparation used Whole Exome Solution and Clinical Exome Solution kits (Sophia Genetics), run on a NextSeq 500 (Illumina). Bioinformaticsanalysis used SOPHiA DDM Â®and VarAFT 2.14. Variants were categorised according to ACMG guidelines; only âPathogenic âorâLikely pathogenic âvariants were repor  ted. In most cases Sanger sequencing con ï¬rmed variants and family segregation. Results: RDs included: Neurodevelopmental (28 patients), Neuromuscular (31), Skeletal/connective tissue (20), Metabolic (8), Dysmorphic syndromes (16), Intellec  tual disability/Autism (6), Kidney (10), Cardiopathies (10),Skin (6), Ears/Eyes (11), Other (30). Diagnostic yield was 42% overall (78/186 cases), reaching >60% for Neurode  velopmental, Skeletal/connective tissue, Skin, Ears/Eyes; 56cases exhibited autosomal dominant inheritance (49 de  novo, 7 inherited), 12 recessive and 10 X linked, including35 known, 47 novel variants (submitted to ClinVar) and 8 variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS). Discussion: NGS supports marked improvement in diagnostic yield for many RDs, sometimes revealing aty  pical phenotypes and/or genotypes. Higher diagnostic yield is achieved for clinically well de ï¬ned cases, supported by family segregation studies. Close collaboration between the laboratory and clinics, supports high quality standards (clinical, laboratory, interpretation, counselling/reporting),fundamental to optimise de ï¬nitive diagnosis, although VUS remain challenging.

Carr2, E. Sheridan1,2, J. Adlard1, D. T. Bonthron1,2 1The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom,2University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom With the widespread use of low cost genome wide diagnostic screening tests, unanticipated but possibly pathogenic dosage changes affecting single genes arediscovered with increasing frequency. Clinical management demands facile validation of such incidental ï¬ndings, often necessitating the design of custom variant speci ï¬c assays. Although deletion variants can be readily con ï¬rmed using a range of next generation sequencing strategies, characteris  ing duplication variants, at nucleotide resolution, remainsdemanding. We have addressed this challenge by deploying a novel Cas9 enrichment strategy combined with long read Oxford Nanopore MinIon sequencing. We used bulkgenomic DNA without the need for PCR ampli ï¬cation. We present the diagnostic resolution of two problematic cases in which incompletely characterised duplicationvariants had been identi ï¬ed by array CGH. The ï¬rst patient presented with learning dif ï¬culties and autism spectrum disorder, but had been found to have an incidental 1.7 kbimbalance which included a partial duplication of VHL exon 3. This was inherited from the patient âs father, who had renal cancer aged 38 years. In the second case, we identi ï¬ed an incidental 200 kb duplication which included DMD exons 30 44. Parental testing was consistent with this variant having arisen de novo . In both cases, the single  molecule sequencing yielded suf ï¬cient information to deï¬ne precisely the architecture of the rearranged region, enabling Sanger sequencing assays across the integrationsites and surrounding homologous regions (that likely gave rise to the duplicated sequences). Adoption of this approach by diagnostic laboratories promises to enable rapid andcost effective characterisation of challenging duplication  containing alleles. C.M. Watson: None. L.A.

Twenty two CMA patien ts of the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study and 307 reference subjects were genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array.

The prognosis is more uncertain when the CNV is inherited from a healthy parent. Here we present two cases of prenatal diagnosis of 1q21.1 deletion with oppositepregnancy issues. The ï¬rst case is a second pregnancy of healthy parents. During the second trimester US examina  tion the AVSD was detected. The amniocentesis wasperformed and array CGH showed 2,6 Mb deletion including GJA5 and GJA8 , inherited by the father. The parents were worried from the uncertain prognosis and thefamily history of relatives with developmental delay, autism and heart defects.

31, De novo variants in neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy,S11.1,,"Germany Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) are frequently accompanied by additional features, such as intellectual disability, epilepsy or autism, but little is known about genetic differences between these NDD entities. Investiga tion of exome wide de novo variants (DNV) in 6,753 NDD parent offspring trios revealed unexpected ï¬ndings when comparing the genetic spectrum of 1,942 individuals withversus 4,811 individuals without epilepsy. Despite marked phenotypic differences, âepileptic encephalopathy âshares a similar genetic spectrum with âNDD with unspeci ï¬ed epilepsy â, which is not re ï¬ected by current clinical classi ï¬cations.

Furthermore, comparing the designs of 24 diagnostic epilepsy panels of differentproviders revealed extensive inconsistencies. All panel designs lacked various genes with high diagnostic value and by contrast showed vast excess of genes with low or nodiagnostic value. Among genetically solved epilepsy cases, the individual DNV gave rise to personalized treatmentapproaches in more than 25%, emphasizing the importance and the bene ï¬t of accurate genetic diagnostics in NDD, especially when accompanied by epilepsy.

Most of the mutations in these genes are disruptive, leading to haploinsuf ï¬ciency. Thus, any mole  cular manipulation eliciting an increase in CHD2/CHD8proteins, could prove bene ï¬cial for therapeutic develop  ment. Here, we intended to provide a Proof of Principle of how SINEUP   recently described class of non codingRNAs able to augment, in a speci ï¬c and controlled way, the expression of target proteins   can rise the translation of CHD2/CHD8 proteins and possibly rescuehaploinsuf ï¬ciency associated phenotypes. Methods: We designed and cloned SINEUP targeting human CHD2/CHD8 isoforms and tested their ef ï¬cacy to increase CHD2/CHD8 protein translation in human iPS  derived neuronal progenitors (iPS NPC) expressing normal and reduced levels of the target proteins and in patients â ï¬broblasts bearing CHD2/CHD8 heterozygous loss of  function mutations. Results: While different CHD2 /CHD8  SINEUP mole  cules were not able to signi ï¬cantly increase protein level in parental iPS NPC, expressing physiologic levels of CHD2/ CHD8, SINEUP revealed to be effective in upregulatingCHD2/CHD8 protein translation when reduced levels of the target proteins were expressed. The ef ï¬cacy of CHD2/ CHD8 SINEUP is currently tested on patient derived cell lines harbouring CHD2/CHD8 truncating mutations.

How  ever, only about 50% of the cases can be genetically explained. Methods: We identi ï¬ed de novo variants in the TAOK1 (thousand and one amino acid kinase 1) gene in NDD patients. To validate this potential novel disease gene we (1)used GeneMatcher to identify additional patients, (2) established a primary ï¬broblast line of one of the patients and collected RNA from patient âsï¬broblasts and blood (PAXTube), and (3) established an RNAi mediated knockdown Drosophila model. Results: We compared the frequency of de novo variants in patient parent trios with (n ,2,030) vs. without (n , 2,755) NDD. We identi ï¬ed de novo variants in TAOK1 in four NDD patients but not in non NDD patients. Twoadditional patients were found through GeneMatcher. All variants were absent from gnomAD. The patients shared a common phenotype of developmental delay. Additionally,four patients had muscular hypotonia and three autism. In theï¬broblast culture, we demonstrated highly reduced TAOK1 mRNA levels compatible with nonsense mediated mRNA decay. No detectable phosphorylated TAOK1 pro  tein was found in these cells. Knockdown of TAO (CG14217) in Drosophila resulted in developmental delay and reduced survival compared to control ï¬ies. Immunos  taining of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), theirendings (boutons), and the ventral nerve cord (VNC) revealed changed NMJ and VNC morphology and sig  niï¬cantly decreased amount of boutons compared to control ï¬ies.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ï¬rst benchmarked our bioinfor  matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conï¬rmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub  stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ï¬rst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B.B.

Here we describe the neurodevelopmental phenotype that resultsfrom disruption of KMT2E in 38 affected individuals from 36 families. From the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), KMT2E is a candidate haploinsuf ï¬cient gene with a LOEUF score of 0.06. This case series includes 28 protein truncating variants (PTVs), four missense variants, and four large deletions encompassing KMT2E , most of which were con ï¬rmed to be de novo. Most affected individuals with protein truncating variants presented with mild intellectual disability, autism and/or epilepsy. Epilepsymore common in females and autism more common in males; many had relative macrocephaly and hypotonia. There appears to be a subtle facial gestalt characterized bydolichocephaly, deep set eyes with down slanting palpebral ï¬ssures, and infraorbital creases. Individuals with micro  deletions encompassing KMT2E showed a greater degree of developmental delay. Individuals with missense variants in KMT2E presented with the most severe developmental delays and treatment resistant infantile epileptic encephalo pathy; microcephaly was common in this group. Haploin  sufï¬ciency versus gain of function or dominant negative effects speci ï¬c to these missense variants in KMT2E may explain this divergence in phenotype but requires indepen  dent validation. To support our ï¬ndings for loss of function inKMT2E , we performed functional analysis by generating a kmt2e knockout Zebra ï¬sh using CRISPR Cas9 technol  ogy.

142, Non penetrance of a frameshifting SHANK3 deletion is associated with compensatory mechanisms in both alleles,C12.6,,"and variable degrees of autism, we found an early frameshifting and maternally derived SHANK3 deletion, (NM_033517.1):c.1030 + 2929_1688 +71delinsG p. (Val344AlafsTer71), removing 10 â13 of the 22 exons. The non mosaic SHANK3 deletion carrier mother is in regular work without learning dif ï¬culties or other problems. To explore how the mother can be non penetrant, we collected blood and ï¬broblast cells from all family members for epigenetic , RNA  and protein studies. In ï¬broblasts, deep sequencing based mRNA quanti ï¬cation indicated that the mother had a 3.5 fold higher SHANK3 mRNA expres  sion from the normal allele than her sons, possibly related to an enhancer triplication 17.5 kb upstream only detected in the mother. This enhancer triplication has a populationprevalence of 20% (561/2771). A more pronounced dif  ference was found for the terminal SHANK3 exons 17 â22 also included in two terminal isoforms (isoE/Promoter5 andisoF/Promoter6) located downstream of the deletion. To investigate the epigenetic status of the CpG islands related to the SHANK3 promoters P1 P6, we performed methylation sensitive amplicon based deep sequencing of DNA puri ï¬ed from blood and ï¬broblasts after bisulphite treatment. The putative isoF promoter (core Promoter6 w/nine CpGs) was hypomethylated ( x Ì,1.5 Â± 0.94%) in ï¬broblast DNA from all deletion carriers compared to control subjects ( x Ì,15.5 Â± 0.74%). In conclusion, non penetrance of an early SHANK3 deletion in a carrier mother is associated with i)higher SHANK3 expression from her normal allele, possibly rela  ted to a common enhancer triplication only in the mother, and ii)increased expression of C terminal SHANK3 iso  forms from both alleles.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti  mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

Muotri11University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States,2Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, United States Introduction: The 16p11.2 is the most common among all rare copy number variants (CNVs) associated with AutismSpectrum Disorder (ASD). We investigated neurodevelop  mental processes impacted by the dosage changes of 16p11.2 CNV using cerebral organoid models. Materials and Methods: We generated 3D cultures (i.e. human cerebral organoids) that model human fetal brain development using iPSCs derived from skin ï¬broblasts of 16p11.2 deletion (DEL) and duplication (DUP) carriers. Transcriptome sequencing, proteomic pro ï¬ling and immu  noï¬uorescence were carried out to investigate molecular and cellular impact of the 16p11.2 CNV. Cell migration, neuronal morphology and synaptogenesis were also investigated. Results: Cerebral organoid recapitulated macrocephaly and microcephaly phenotypes observed in 16p11.2 DEL and DUP carriers. Increased proliferation of neuropro genitor cells was observed in DELs. Gene co expression network analyses identi ï¬ed co expression modules that were strongly associated with 16p11.2 copy number status.A module enriched in genes with cell migration and loco  motion functions was downregulated in DELs. A module enriched in genes with synaptic functions, was upregulatedin DELs. Severe migration defects in DEL organoids were conï¬rmed by Boyden chamber assay. Neurons derived from DEL organoids had longer neurites and increased soma size.The number of functional synapses was also higher in DEL organoids. Treatment with the RhoA inhibitor rhosin res  cued cell migration defects. Conclusion: Cerebral organoids recapitulate patients head size phenotypes and gene expression pro ï¬les of fetal human brain. Genes associated with cell migration andsynaptic functions were dysregulated by the 16p11.2 CNV. These molecular ï¬ndings were validated experimentally and rescued by a small molecule inhibitor. L.

De novo missense variants in this gene have been linked to developmental disorders (DD) in a large scale study ofpatients with severe undiagnosed DD (Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Only ï¬ve patients have been reported to date and clinical data remains very scarce. We report a new patientwith COL4A3BP  related intellectual disability (ID) aiming to contribute to the recognition of this condition. Materials and methods: Clinical data was collected from the patient âs medical records and compared with previous reports from scienti ï¬c literature and databases. Results: A 5 year old girl with unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery, presented with postnatal microcephaly, axial hypotonia, and severe global864 J. del Picchiadevelopmental delay. Short stature and facial dysmorphisms were noted and, at 24 months, she developed generalized seizures. Currently, she does not walk unaided, says only one word, and has poor visual contact and marked stereotypic behavior with bruxism. Whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a de novo pathogenic variant in COL4A3BP (S260L). Conclusions: This missense variant was previously found in 4 out of 5 known patients, suggesting a mutational hotspot in this gene. Former functional evidence indicates itresults in intracellular imbalances in ceramide, pivotal to the synthesis of sphingolipids. Our case has signi ï¬cant overlap with clinical data from previous patients.

Additional clinical fea  tures include dysmorphic features, obesity, musculoskeletal disorders (hypotonia, hypermobility, kyphoscoliosis) andbehavioural problems (autistic spectrum disorders) and afebrile seizures. The underlying cause of the syndrome is constitutive variants in the DNMT3 gene. We present an 11  old boy with recognized Tatton Brown Rahman syndrome and con ï¬rmed variant in the DNMT3 gene. Materials and methods: During molecular diagnostic procedure analysis of FMR1 gene for FRAXA syndrome and panel of 264 genes correlated with autism and mental retardation (NGS) were performed. Results: ForFMR1 gene expansion of CGG repeats was not identi ï¬ed. NGS analysis allowed identi ï¬cation of known heterozygotic variant p.Pro904Leu (c.2711C>T) intheDNMT3A . This variant is reported in dbSNP database (rs149095705) and ClinVar Database as likely pathogenic. Molecular analysis of p.Pro904Leu was also performed forproband âs mother and sister were mutation was not identi ï¬ed. Unfortunately the father âs material was not available for genetic analysis. There is high probability ofde novo character of identi ï¬ed variant. Conclusions: In the case of patients with intellectual disability and obesity, Tatton Brown Rahman syndromeshould be considered in the differential diagnosis. Studies using the NGS technique facilitate the diagnosis of patients with intellectual disabilities. I. Jaszczuk: None. I. Winkler: None. A. Sobczy Åska  Tomaszewska: None. M. Lejman: None. A.

Several ultra rare NDD associated variants in numerousgenes speci ï¬c almost to single families have been identi ï¬ed by unbiased next generation sequencing technologies. To determine the genetic component of NDD in a con sanguineous family from Turkey, we have performed SNP  based homozygosity mapping in the family along with whole exome sequencing (WES) in the affected sib pair. The SNP genotyping data generated on two different array chips was combined with PLINK to detect homozygous stretches common to the affected sib pair. The WES data wasï¬ltered for rare alleles with predicted pathogenic impact on protein function in the homozygous loci. This collective effort has led us to identify a loss of function variant in NALCN in the homozygous state. Sanger sequencing has con ï¬rmed segregation of this variant with the NDD phenotype in the pedigree. NALCN encodes a member of sodium leak channel complex and is associated with a recessive OMIM phenotype; Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (MIM:615419) Our study presents the combined analysis of linkage and exome analysis as a powerful and precise tool to diagnose a clinically rare and recessively inherited condition onmolecular level.

153, Intrafamilial variability of Refsum syndrome,P08.33,,"ted by intellectual disability and developmental delay hasbeen investigated by genetic diagnostics. The younger girl has more severe development delay and shows in contrast to her sister microcephaly, craniosynostosis and autisticbehaviour. Whole exome sequencing of the more severe affected sister revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant in PEX5   a gene known to be causative for autosomal recessive Refsum syndrome. Segregation analysis con  ï¬rmed homozygosity of the variant in the other sister and heterozygosity of the parents. Whole exome sequencing didnot detect another potential pathogenic variant. Thus, it can be concluded that the detected PEX5 variant causes a Refsum syndrome with uncharacteristic features and a highintrafamilial variability. S. Geuer: A.

De novo mutations in CHD3 result in Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome (#MIM618205), characterized by global developmental delays and/or intel  lectual disability, speech delay, macrocephaly, hypotoniaand facial dysmorphism. The vast majority (~95%) of pathogenic mutations reported so far are missense muta  tions. Interestingly, CHD3 is predicted to be extremely intolerant for loss of function variance. Non penetrance and/ or variable expressivity has not been reported. Here we describe two cases with seemingly pathogenic, but inher ited, protein truncating variants in CHD3 . In a 4 year old girl with global developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, severe feeding dif ï¬culties, and facial dysmorphisms, ï¬tting with the spectrum of Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome, whole exome sequencing revealed a nonsense variant, p.(W1217*), in the CHD3helicase domain. The variant was inherited from her healthy mother and grandmother. In a 3 year old boy with developmental delays, pre  dominated by speech delay, another maternally inherited nonsense variant, p.(S1443*), was found. Facially, he resembled the gestalt previously described for SnijdersBlok Campeau syndrome. His mother, in whom the variant872 J. del Picchiawas de novo, had macrocephaly and was otherwise unaffected. These two cases exemplify that protein truncating variants inCHD3 may result in reduced penetrance and/or variable expressivity. We are currently collecting more families with inherited CHD3 variants to enhance our understanding of disease penetrance in Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome.

Chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) has offered a high detection rate of small and large CNVs associated with ASD, and ledto discovery of new autism genes. We report on the results of chromosomal CMA investigation in a group of ASDs patients. Eighty patients were referred to our laboratory forgenetic testing with ASDs as part of a broad phenotype including ID or other clinical features. A complete clinical evaluation was performed with focus on psychiatric exam ination and psychological evaluation with speci ï¬c ASDs tests (ADOS, ADI R). Array CGH completed with kar  yotyping, FISH and qPCR tests were performed. A total of21 pathological CNVs (14 deletions and 7 duplications), with a median length of 3.7 Mb were detected in 17 patients. The involved genomic regions overlap 550 OMIMgenes. Besides well described syndromic regions associated with ASDs (e.g. deletions of 1q21.1, 22q13.3, 22q11.2, MBD5; Xq28 duplication), other genomic regions, rarelyreported in patients with ASDs were identi ï¬ed (deletion of 8p11.2p21.2, 9q34.1, 9p13, duplication of 7p22.2p22.1 , CHRNA7) ; thus having the potential to reveal new ASD genes. Our data illustrates the utility of array CGH in the investigation of patients with ASDs, speci ï¬cally in the context of complex phenotypes.

166, A new case of beta propeller protein associated neuro degeneration (BPAN) in a 7 year old male with a novel mosaic WDR45 mutation,P09.09,,"CA, United States Introduction: Beta propeller protein associated neurode  generation (BPAN) is a neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorder. BPAN is very rare, with few than 60 cases reported to date in which the vast majority of cases arefemale and sporadic, resulting from a de novo mutation in the WDR45 gene located at Xp11.23. Here we report a new case of BPAN in a male. Case Description: This a 7 years old adoptive boy with history of autism, developmental delay, and seizures. He was not able to walk until age of 4 and nonverbal. He wasdiagnosed with Lennox Gastaut syndrome. EEG (during the sleep) showed frequent to abundant high to very high voltage sharp, spike and slow wave discharges present inright and left hemisphere. The brain MRI indicated prominent mineralization of the globus pallidi and sub  stantia nigra considering iron accumulation or mitochon drial disorder. Result: The initial workup of chromosome microarray was negative, the subsequent brain iron accumulation genepanel reported as WDR45, X linked, c.577C>T (p. Gln193*), zygosity (indeterminate, 46% allele fraction), pathogenic. Discussion/Conclusion: BPAN is phenotypically similar in both male and female which is characterized by clustered spasm, hypsarrhythmia patterns on EEG and developmentaldelay or regress. The similarity in both genders was explained by somatic mosaicism in surviving males and germline or somatic mutations in females, as well asskewing of X chromosome inactivation. Only a few male cases were reported and this is a new male case with a novel mosaic mutation and presenting with characteristic clinicalfeatures. H. Wang: None. G. Fteeh: None. E",2020.0,,"H.

176, NGS survey in neurological disorders focus on variants in HLA class II genes,P09.23,,"Molecular Medicine Center, MU So ï¬a, So ï¬a, Bulgaria Neuroin ï¬ammatory mechanisms may be involved in the genesis of epilepsies and autistic spectrum disorders. An NGS study with TrueSightOne gene panel was performed on 30 patients with neurological disorders (including sei zures as a main component). In 10 patients pathogenic/ probably pathogenic mutations were discovered. We haveperformed comprehensive study of HLA gene variants discovered by NGS after lack of pathogenic mutations in patients affected by epilepsy with or without autism/mental retardation and compared with patients with other pathol  ogies (referred as controls). We focused on variants anno  tated as Variants of Unknown Signi ï¬cance (VUS). We determined the frequency of such variants in DRB1 and DRB5, in cases and controls, as they were the most com  monly found in both groups. The frequency varied between11 15% in cases and 11 23% in controls. In addition, we reported variants found only in cases(5 variants in DRB5 and 1 in DRB1), only in controls (7 in DRB5 and 10 inDRB1) and both in cases and controls (5 in DRB5 and 6 in DRB1). We found 2 HLA DMB and 2 HLA G variants only in cases.

185, Early onset of complex seizures as a ï¬rst sign of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome,P09.42,,"Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Background: Recent technologies enabled clari ï¬cation of some previously undetected causes of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. There are reports of 16p11.2 deletion in the literature, describing variable clinical pre sentation in patients. Most of them describe developmental delay, autism and seizures, however phenotypic pattern is undistinguishable and variable. There is still no suf ï¬cient clinical data of this CNV in babies. Case report: We report on a patient with developmental delay and complex seizures. This is a second child in afamily, the pregnancy and delivery was uneventful. Microcephaly, foramen ovale and generalized hypotonia were noticed shortly after birth. At the age of 3 months hedeveloped infantile spasms, followed by profound devel  opmental delay within the next several months. He has microcephaly, early closure of the fontanel, high forehead,bitemporal narrowing, wide nasal root, narrow palpebral features, upper lip notch, short neck, cryptorchidism. Karyotype was normal. aCGH analysis (using Affymetrix Â® CytoScan TM750K Array) showed deletion of 16p11.2 (1.430 kb), also deletion on chromosome 14q11.2 (433 kb), both are considered as pathogenic according aDGVdatabase. Discussion and conclusion: Deletion of the 16p11.2 is mostly described in older children that developed autisticspectrum of disorder, ADHD, etc. Wide clinical variability is described between patients, mostly due to the variations on size and breakpoint of the deleted region. There are someinconsistencies in phenotype described in literature, how  ever this could be a part of a changing phenotype with age. Since the baby had two pathogenic microdeletions, it isdifï¬cult to distinguish between two phenotypes. E. Sukarova Angelovska: None. V. Anastasovska: None. F. Duma: None. L. Muaremovska: None. D.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ï¬ndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the ï¬rstPTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe. This is also the largest pediatriccohort for PTEN prevalence study in patients with ASD and macrocephaly. Materials and methods: PTEN sequencing were done for 128 patients with ASD and head cir cumference size more than 97% on growth charts between the ages of 3 to 18 recruited from ï¬ve different child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in Turkey. Result: We found 2known pathogenic, 1 new pathogenic and 2 variants of insigni ï¬cance (VUS) mutations out of 128 patients. The prevalence is 2,3% (VUS mutations are excluded).

218, 16p13.11 microduplication in a patient with seizures:A case report about an elusive syndrome,P11.001,,"Background: The short arm of chromosome 16, (16p) and especially the 16p13.11 region is involved in manystructural variants. To date, deletions of this region is mostly considered as pathogenic; yet duplications are still controversial. Here a patient with 16p13.11 duplication that have ï¬ndings concordant with previous reports and two additional ï¬ndings is presented, aiming to further enhance our understanding of the nature of 16p rearrangements. Materials and methods: After the DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood sample of the patient, the data obtained by microarray using the âafyymetrix cytoscan optima array kit âwere analyzed for gain or loss according to the GRCh37 (hg19) reference genome using ChAS 3.1.1.27 (Chromosome Analysis Suite) software. Case Report: Patient is a 5 years and 2 months old female, admitted to pediatric neurology department with the complaints of seizures and speech delay. She was diagnosedwith epilepsy and atypic autism. A peripheral blood karyotyping was normal (46,XX). Microarray result of the patient revealed a 1833 kbp long microduplication, invol ving the 16p13.11 region.

255, Neurodevelopmental disorders and chromatin remodel ing dysregulation: the lessons from Kabuki syndromespectrum and clinical presentation of Tunisian cases,P11.056,,"Kaabi, W. Ltaif, S. Aloulou, S. Mallek, S. Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ï¬lled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen  tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ï¬nally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ï¬ve cardinal manifestations of KB deï¬ned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ï¬nitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ï¬rmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N.B. Abdelmoula: B.

A 4 years and 11 months old boy with a cMRI showing large bifronto temporal arachnoidal cysts and multifocal white matter lesions involving theperiventricular, deep, and subcortical cerebral white matter. The phenotype of the boy included mild developmental delay, strabism, slightly dysmorphicfeatures and mild hearing impairment. Molecular karyotyping detected a ~ 3,9 Mb heterozygous microdeletion in 6p25.3   6p25.2deleting 34 genes, 18 of which were OMIM annotated including the transcription factor FOXC1. 2. A 13 year old girl with Axenfeld Rieger anomaly who developed glaucoma at the age of 12 years and had surgery for ASD II in the ï¬rst year of life. The phenotype of the girl included typical dysmorphicfeatures. She performs extremely well at high school (Gymnasium) and in sports. Molecular karyotyping detected a ~ 2,35 Mb heterozygous Deletion in6p25.3 6p25.2 deleting 17 genes, 8 of which are annotated in OMIM, including FOXC1. From our cases and from review of the literature we conclude that a microdeletion in 6p25 should be considered as the cause in patients with unclear multifocal cerebralwhite matter abnormalities or Axenfeld Rieger syndrome when additional dysmorphic features and congenital anomalies are present, even when intellectual abilities arewithin the normal range (Vernon et al. 2013).

Recently, PACS2 gene mutations have been implicated in DEE with cere bellar dysgenesis and facial dysmorphism. Almost all described patients presented with a recurrent de novo mis  sense mutation, c.625G>A (p.Glu209Lys). Their phenotypewas characterized by early onset epilepsy, cerebellar dys  genesis, dysmorphic facial features, moderate to severe developmental delay, and autism. We report the ï¬rst Bul  garian case of this rare syndrome. Case Report: The patient, a 17 month old boy, was referred to genetic evaluation because of the developmental delay andneonatal convulsions started during the ï¬rst week of life. He was born at term after complica ted pregnancy. Birth weight was 3920 g and length was 51 cm. Physical examinationshowed facial dysmorphism including hypertelorism, down  slanted palpebral ï¬ssures, broad nasal root, broad ï¬at nasal bridge, broad nasal tip, posteri orly rotated ears, downturned corners of the mouth and thin lips. Additional features include micropenis, inverted widely spaced nipples, one hypopigmen  ted skin spot, one cafÃ© au lait spot, nevus ï¬ammeus on the neck and coloboma of the iris.924 J. del PicchiaResults: The molecular genetic analysis was performed by whole exome sequencing (WES) of trio.

In this collaborative study, we assessed 125 can didate and high con ï¬dence genes in a large cohort of NDD cases. Materials and Methods: We targeted 63 candidate genes for resequencing among 16,321 NDD cases and an additional 62 high con ï¬dence genes in 6,211 NDD cases. In order to test for signi ï¬cance at the level of case control mutation burden and integrating with previously published data, we assessed these genes among NDD cases and compared the mutation burden to nonpsychiatric controlsfrom ExAC. These genes were assessed also in a combined set of 17,426 NDD parent child trios. Furthermore,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 3thorough phenotype studies for seven of the genes with evidence of mutational burden were performed in a subset of the patients. Results: We identi ï¬ed 48 genes (25 newly reported) with a signi ï¬cant burden of ultra rare (MAF < 0.01%) severe mutations. Among the 125 targeted genes, we show that 90genes are also enriched for DNMs in parent child trios. We here focus on seven genes ( CTCF ,HNRNPU ,KCNQ3 , ZBTB18 ,TCF12, SPEN and LEO1 ) for detailed clinical descriptions to delineate the associated phenotypes and clinical presentation of these speci ï¬c and newly described neurodevelopmental disorders.

17, Nonsense Mediated Decay in Neuronal Development and Disease,S06.1,,"Univerity of California, San Diego, CA, United States Nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a highly selective and conserved RNA turnover pathway that promotes the decay of speci ï¬c subsets of RNAs. A critical factor in the NMD pathway is UPF3B, an adapter protein that binds with other NMD proteins to form a molecular complex that drives rapid RNA decay. In humans, mutations in UPF3B cause intellectualdisability (ID) and are strongly associated with autism, atten  tion de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia (SCZ). To understand UPF3B âs role in vivo, we generated a mouse model with a null mutation in the Upf3b gene. These Upf3b  null mice are viable but exhibit a profound defect in pre pusle inhibition (PPI), a measure of sensomotor gating commonlydeï¬cient in individuals with SCZ and other brain disorders. These NMD de ï¬cient mice also have de ï¬cits in speci ï¬cf o r m s of learning and memory. Consistent with both their PPI andlearning defects, speci ï¬c neuronal cell subsets in Upf3b null mice display de ï¬cient dendritic spine maturation in vivo. Neural stem cells from Upf3b null mice have impaired abilityto undergo differentiation and require prolonged culture to give rise to functional neurons with electrical activity. During the course of our analysis, we discovered that Upf3b null micealso have a phenotype consistent with a partial olfactory defect. This provided an opportunity to examine the role of Upf3b in olfactory neurogenesis, a simple and easily tractable neuraldevelopmental system. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA  seq) analysis revealed that Upf3b null mice have speci ï¬c defects in olfactory neurogenesis, including in olfactory stem cells. These NMD de ï¬cient mice also had de ï¬cits in the olfactory receptor (OR) repertoire in olfactory sensory neuro nal subsets at different stages of development. The nature of these defects strongly suggested that NMD has a key role in the OR selection process. We suggest that NMD de ï¬cient Upf3b null mice will be a useful model system to decipher the roles of NMD in neural development and function in vivo. M. Wilkinson: None.",2020.0,,M. Wilkinson,*
51, Microcephaly: genetics and disease mechanisms,E06.1,,"ErasmusMC, Department of Clinical Genetics, Rotterdam, NetherlandsAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 23Microcephaly is de ï¬ned by a head circumference (HC) below 2 SD standard deviations for age and sex. A dis  tinction is generally made between congenital or primary microcephaly, i.e. a small HC for gestational age at birth, and progressive or post natal microcephaly, i.e. normal HC at birth followed by insuf ï¬cient growth during infancy and childhood. When small head circumference re ï¬ects an insufï¬cient brain growth, microcephaly is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), such as intellectualdisability, epilepsy, autism. The most common structural abnormality in primary microcephaly is a simpli ï¬ed gyral pattern of the cortex. Association with other malformations,e.g. lissencephaly or polymicrogyria, implies neurological sequelae and in ï¬uences disease course. Nevertheless, prognostic evaluation in a newborn with microcephalyremains dif ï¬cult. Compatibly with a very high mitotic rate and scheduled cell death of neural progenitors of the developing human cortex, the most relevant genes andprocesses affected in primary microcephaly relate to reg  ulation of the cell cycle (e.g. mitotic spindle formation and orientation, centrosome biology, mitotic chromosomestructure, double strand DNA repair and chromosome sta  bility) or of scheduled apoptosis. There is partial etiologic overlap with the pathogenesis of progressive microcephaly,which mostly affect control of DNA repair, or regulation of intermediate metabolism. However, novel paradigms are emerging in the pathogenesis of microcephaly, which arerelated to regulation of the balance between ER controlled proteostasis and cell cycle. This subtle balance might reveal to be one of the factors determining the difference betweena stable microcephaly phenotype (as observed in many types of primary microcephaly) to a progressive, hence severe course as observed in many types of progressivemicrocephaly.

Constitutional and mosaic mutations of multiple cell growth pathways, including the PI3K AKT MTOR and RAS pathways, have been identi ï¬ed in this spectrum; with promising therapeutic avenues on the horizon to amelioratethe associated neurological de ï¬cits (e.g. MTOR pathway inhibitors). However, signi ï¬cant molecular and clinical challenges remain. Widely used molecular diagnosticmethods, such as standard depth exome sequencing, lack the sensitivity to detect low level mosaic mutations common in MEG. These methods are also not suitable forscreening limited amounts of surgically resected brain tissues due to their high DNA input requirements. Ultimately, more optimal molecular diagnostic methodsand high throughput pre clinical models are necessary to identify and study the effects of MEG related mutations on brain development. To address these challenges, we utilize acombination of ultra deep targeted sequencing employing digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) as a new and sensitive tool for screening common mutations in the PI3K AKT MTORpathway, and a quad based exome approach, sequencing lesional (affected) tissues at a higher depth (200 250X). To date, we performed genetic testing on a large cohort ofMEG families and have identi ï¬ed both known and novel candidate genetic variants, including ultra low level mosaic mutations in the PI3K AKT MTOR pathway. Our datadescribe a gradient of mosaicism seen within the brain in hemimegalencephaly samples; with mutation positive regions ranging in alternate allele frequencies (AAF) from0.3% to 25.6% across several brain tissues. We subse  quently aimed to model disease pathogenesis in vitro, selecting patient derived ï¬broblast lines with mutations in key upstream ( PIK3CA ) and downstream ( MTOR ) nodes in the pathway. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying the common PIK3CA H1047Rand MTORT1977Imutations to characterize these nodes. Our results suggest that targeted molecular analysis for the common PI3K AKT MTOR pathway mutations by ddPCRis an effective molecular diagnostic approach for MEG. Given the high sensitivity and low DNA input requirements for this assay, ddPCR may also be an effective moleculartool for other mosaic disorders with a narrow mutational spectrum. Our iPSC derived lines provide a valuable model for dissecting the functional consequences of these muta tions and future drug screens using PI3K AKT MTOR pathway inhibitors. F. Pirozzi: None. A.

A homo  zygous knockout of the orthologous Satb1 leads to mice lethality, demonstrating its importance in early development. Methods and results: Here, we report on 26 individuals with SATB1 variants. Seventeen patients have missense variants predicted to be deleterious, and nine have truncating variants, three of which predicted to escapenonsense mediated decay. 21 of 26 variants (80%) were conï¬rmed to be de novo in origin. Patients showed a broad phenotypic spectrum, including ID and/or neurodevelop mental delay, epilepsy, dental abnormalities and aspeci ï¬c brain MRI ï¬ndings. Additionally, patients with missense variants are more severely affected than those withtruncating variants. We characterized the effects of eight different missense mutations, including two recurrent variants, in cell based assays. Compatible with a gain of function effect of missense variants, mutated SATB1 proteins showed altered nuclear localization and increased transcriptional repression on two characterized targets (IgH MAR site and the IL2 promoter). Consistent with this hypothesis, ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments demonstrated a decrease in mobilityof mutant SATB1, suggesting stabilization of DNA binding underlying the increased transcriptional activity. Transcrip  tome analysis is currently ongoing to further substantiatethese ï¬ndings. Conclusions: In summary, through multi center colla  borations, we show that SATB1 is associated with an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder, resulting from distinct mutation speci ï¬c pathophysiological mechanisms.

The most frequent cause of mono  genic ID   the fragile X syndrome  is due to the absence of the RNA binding protein (RBP) FMRP. Many other IDgenes have been implicated in the RNA metabolism. NOVA2 is a RBP known to regulate neuron speci ï¬c alternative splicing (AS). We identi ï¬ed 6 individuals with de novo frameshift variants in NOVA2 affected with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by ID, motor and speech delay, autistic features, spasticity or ataxic gaitand abnormal brain MRI. All variants cluster in a small GC  repeat rich region, located in the last exon, indicating that the mutated transcript might escape to nonsense mediated decay. All 6 frameshift variants lead to the addition of a novel common C terminal part instead of the last KH RNA binding domain, suggesting a dominant negative mechan  ism. We detected 41 genes differentially spliced after downregulation of NOVA2 in human neuronal cells. TheNOVA2 variant protein shows decreased ability to bind target RNA sequences and to regulate target AS events. It also fails to complement the effect on neurite outgrowthinduced by NOVA2 downregulation in vitro and to rescue alterations of retinotectal axonal path ï¬nding induced by loss of NOVA2 ortholog in zebra ï¬sh. Our results showed that truncating mutations in NOVA2 cause a syndromic form of ID, suggesting a hypomorphic mechanism rather than a full heterozygous loss of function, although a speci ï¬c con  tribution of the novel C terminal extension cannot be excluded.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 33F.

Pro  tein truncating variants (PTVs) in the last two exons of SRCAP cause Floating Harbor syndrome (FLHS), which is characterized by typical facial features, short stature with delayed bone age and expressive speech delay. We report on novel genotype phenotype correlations, associated withSRCAP PTVs outside the FLHS locus. We identi ï¬ed 21 probands with PTVs upstream, and 5 with PTVs downstream of the reported FLHS locus. Mostpatients presented with speech delay and intellectual disability. In contrast to FLHS, they have normal height and bone age. Moreover, facial recognition algorithms on2D photos showed that patients with upstream and down  stream PTVs do not cluster with the FLHS facial gestalt. The upstream PTVs result in subtle facial dysmorphism,autism spectrum disorder, severe behavioral problems and joint issues, such as hypermobility and premature degen  eration. In contrast, patients with downstream PTVs haveneurodevelopmental delay and Marfanoid habitus. At the molecular level, FLHS is characterized by a unique DNA methylation (DNAm) signature consisting of ~570differentially methylated CpGs. The DNAm pro ï¬les of the upstream and downstream PTVs yielded different signa  tures from FLHS. In summary, we delineate the phenotype of patients with SRCAP PTVs outside the FLHS locus. None of the patients show clinical features typical for FLHS. Analysis at the molecular level suggests that each clinical entity is associated with its own molecular mechanism. We proposethat the upstream PTVs result in haploinsuf ï¬ciency, whereas the downstream PTVs and FLHS causing variants result in distinct dominant negative or gain of functioneffect. D. Rots: None.

Though individually rare, the collective con  tribution of RGDs to developmental disorders is substantial.Here, we compared the tissue speci ï¬c functional and tran  scriptional signatures associated with two RGDs: 16p11.2 (740 kb, 29 genes) and 15q13.3 (1.5 Mb, 7 genes). For16p11.2 we generated 304 RNAseq libraries across three tissues cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, and striatum from 101 total mice, and isogenic CRISPR engineered human neuralstem cells (NSCs, n ,27 lines) and NGN2 induced neurons (iNs, n ,19 lines), while 119 libraries were analyzed for 15q13.3 across NSCs (24 lines), iNs (23 lines), and braintissue from 48 mice. Transcriptome pro ï¬ling of both the RGDs revealed that the strongest and most consistent effects occurred within the CNV segment while most sec ondary regulatory effects were tissue speci ï¬c. Co expres  sion analyses isolated modules that were enriched for RGD genes, DEGs, and highly constrained and genes associatedwith NDD and autism. Genes regulating actin ï¬lament and cytoskeleton organization, neuron projection, calcium sig  naling pathway, and ion channel activity were signi ï¬cantly altered in 15q13.3 iNs. Using a weighted z score meta 70 J. del Picchiaanalysis, we discovered convergence on shared molecular pathways across the RGDs, most prominently including alterations to genes involved in myelin sheath formation, dendritic function, and mitochondrial function. Intriguingly, neuron phenotyping assays revealed signi ï¬cant antagonistic effect of these RGDs on neurite length and number ofbranchpoints in iNs.

126, Autism Comorbidities: Role of CHD8 during the Development of the Enteric Nervous System,C12.4,,"IGBMC, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France Introduction: CHD8 is mutated in 0.21% of total autism spectrum disorders (ASD) cases. Recently, clinical reas  sessment highlighted the high prevalence of gastrointestinal(GI) defects in ASD. Transient suppression of chd8 in zebra ï¬sh led to a reduced number of enteric neurons and a decreased gut mobility which likely drive the GI problems(Bernier et al. Cell, 2014). Materials and Methods: To understand how the loss of chd8 causes the loss of mature enteric neurons, we generated and characterized a stable mutant zebra ï¬sh line: Tg(chd8 sa19827;phox2bb:GFP ) in which the neuronal pro  genitors (i.e. enteric neural crest cells, eNCCs) are labeledwith GFP. Results: First, we observed a migration delay and reduced proliferation of eNCCs during early developmentand a decreased number of mature neurons and more speciï¬cally serotonergic neurons at 5 days post fertilization. Second, transcriptomic analyses of eNCCs revealed theupregulation of the serotonin receptor htr6 and the dysregulation of several actors of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity and RhoA pathways, extracellular matrix compo nents, and several genes from the human morbid genome. Third, behavioral analyses showed i) hyperactivity of the mutant chd8 larvae and ii) normal sociability and no aggressive behavior in the adult mutants. Conclusion: We showed that the decreased number of enteric neurons in absence of chd8 is due to a combination of proliferation, migration and differentiation defects of the eNCCs. Moreover, our transcriptomic data identi ï¬ed druggable targets in chd8  associated signaling pathwaysand we are currently performing rescue experiments with small molecules in the chd8 mutants.

127, A human single cell atlas of the Substantia nigra reveals novel cell speci ï¬c pathways associated with the genetic risk of Parkinson âs disease and neuropsychiatric disorders.,C12.5,,"Monzon Sandoval2, R. Bowden1, J. Alegre Abarrategui1,R . Wade Martins1,C. Webber2,1* 1Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom,2UK Demen  tia Research Institute, Cardiff, United Kingdom We sequenced ~ 17,000 nuclei from both the Cortex and Substantia Nigra (SN) of ï¬ve human brains and generated theï¬rst human single nuclei transcriptomic atlas of the SN, a region playing important roles in reward and movement. By mapping genetic variants associated with different human traits to SN cell type speci ï¬c gene expression pat  terns, we demonstrate for the ï¬rst time that Parkinson âs disease (PD) genetic risk, for which the symptoms are caused by loss of SN dopaminergic neurons (DaNs), isindeed associated with DaN speci ï¬c gene expression affecting pathways such as mitochondrial organisation and functioning, protein ubiquitination and vesicle transport.However, we also identify a distinct cell type association between PD risk and oligodendrocyte speci ï¬c gene expression. Unlike Alzheimer âs disease (AD), we ï¬nd no association between PD risk and microglia or astrocytes, suggesting that neuroin ï¬ammation plays a less causal role in PD than AD. Beyond PD, we ï¬nd other neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia (SCZ), to be associated to SN DaNs and GABAergic neurons. Nevertheless, we ï¬nd that each neuropsychiatric disorder is associated with adistinct set of genes within those neuronal types. On the contrary, we ï¬nd an overlapping component of risk between neuropsychiatric disorders in the association to glial cells,particularly oligo precursor cells (OPCs).

XCE is one of the most frequent epilepsies. It is a disorder ofcellular mosaics, i.e. hete rozygous females (due to X  inactivation mosaicism) or postzygotic somatic mosaic males. Hemizygous males without functional PCDH19are not affected. In the present study we investigated the complexity of the XCE NDD phenotype as well as the cellular and molecular determinants of its variable(~80%) penetrance. Firstly, using standardized survey tools we have assessed executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory) and psychiatric comorbidities (SocialResponsiveness Scale, Social Communication Ques  tionnaire, Strengths and Dif ï¬culties Questionnaire, and Dimensional Obsessive Compulsive Scale) on 112 indi viduals with deleterious PCDH19 variant, males and females. Genetic, seizure, an d developmental information were also collected. Developmental delay prior to seizureonset occurred in 18%, executive dysfunction and ASD in 60% of individuals. 21% of in dividuals met criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, distinct from ASD. There were no phenotypic differences between heterozygous females and somatic mosaic ma les attesting to the cellular mosaicism as the disease dri ver. Secondly, we assessed 322 PCDH19 missense variants, 45 of which we tested experimentally using in vitro assays to engineer a highaccuracy PCDH19 variant predictor toolbox. Thirdly, using patient derived skin ï¬broblast cell lines we identi  ï¬ed genetic (mRNA, protein) and epigenetic (methyla  tion) biomarkers of the penetrance of XCE even among discordant monozygotic twins .

Snyder1 1Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,2EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany,3University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States Physical interactions between distal regulatory elements in the genome play a key role in regulating gene expression, yet the extent to which these interactions vary between cell types andcontribute to cell type speci ï¬cg e n ee x p r e s s i o na n dh o wt h e y are related to overall gene function remains unclear. To address these questions as part of ENCODE Phase III, we mappedcohesin mediated chromatin loops, using a high resolution ChIA PET assay, and gene expression in 24 diverse human cell types, including core ENCODE cell lines. We ï¬nd that 28% of all chromatin loops vary across cell types, and these changes are effective at grouping cell types based on their tissue of origin, indicating commonalities in three dimensional(3D) genome architecture amongst related cell types. This also applied to different cell types that were derived from the same individual, demonstrating that the observed variation is mainlydue to epigenetic changes. Cell type speci ï¬c loops show dif  ferent patterns of chromatin states, with stem cell loops being depleted of active promoter states and transcription, and enri  ched in bivalent states. We further ï¬nd that the connectivity of genes corresponds to different functional classes, with house keeping genes being connected by few loops, and dosage  sensitive genes being highly connected to enhancer elements. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic variants identi ï¬ed in GWAS are enriched in variable loops in disease relevant cell types. Overall, our results provide important insights on how variation in 3D chromatin organization correspondsto cell type speci ï¬c functions and identity. F. Grubert: None. R. Srivas: None. D.

O âMara QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia We have previously identi ï¬ed 11 joint risk endometrial  ovarian cancer loci through analysis of genome wide association study (GWAS) data from the two largest studies of these diseases. To ï¬nd candidate target genes at joint risk loci, we performed HiChIP chromatin looping analysis of three endometrial and three ovarian cancer cell lines. To enrich for enhancer promoter interactions, a mechanismthrough which GWAS identi ï¬ed variation may target genes, we captured loops associated with H3K27Ac histone (characteristic of promoters and enhancers). We identi ï¬ed 60,208 182,001 replicated loops per cell line, 28 44% of which contacted a promoter. Intersection of promoter  associated loops with statistically credible risk variantshighlighted 59 genes, at eight joint risk loci, as candidate targets in both endometrial and ovarian cancer cell lines. These genes included those with well established oncogenicroles (e.g. TERT ,MYC andCCND1 ). Among the candidate target genes, there was a two fold enrichment (p ,0.01) for genes differentially expressed in endometrial or ovariantumours. Network analysis prioritised a set of proteins that interact with those encoded by candidate target genes. This set was 16 fold enriched (p ,2Ã10 â15) for endometrial or ovarian cancer drivers and included proteins encoded by mismatch repair genes MLH1 ,MSH2 andMSH6 , for which variants are penetrant for endometrial cancer and ovariancancer. Lastly, candidate target genes and prioritised inter  acting proteins were over represented in pathways related to endometrial and ovarian cancer development. In summary, we have identi ï¬ed biologically relevant candidate genes and pathways, providing insight into endometrial and ovariancancer aetiology.

Pre synaptic disorders, characterized bycongenital nystagmus and photophobia, night blindness, are known as cone rod synaptic disorder (CRSD) can be mis  taken for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Full  ï¬eld electroretinogram is crucial for the differential diagnosis, but it can be dif ï¬cult to perform in young children. Here, we report (i) the identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in the RIMS2 gene encoding a pre synaptic protein not yet asso  ciated with human diseases in 3/4 families initially referred for LCA and (ii) the diagnostic adjustment to CRSD withvariable associated alteration including autistic behavior and insulinopathy. Methods : Exome sequencing combined with targeted RIMS2 testing were performed in 46 prescreened patients with CRSD and 94 with LCA. Biallelic RIMS2 mutated cases underwent ophthalmologic, neurologic and metabolicassessment. RIMS2 immunostaining was performed on human retina, brain and pancreas. Nonsense variants were functionally investigated in mammalian cells. Results.Biallelic RIMS2 sequence variants were found in four unrelated families. RIMS2, a protein regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis localizes in the human retinal outerplexiform layer, Purkinje cells and pancreatic islets. Apart from CRSD, neurodevelopmental disease was observed in all cases, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in the eldestpatient.?Nonsense variants lead to truncated RIMS2 and decreased insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Conclusion : This is the ï¬rst report of syndromic CRSD with neurodevelopmental or pancreatic involvement due to RIMS2 loss of function.

148, The genotype phenotype correlation of intragenic RBFOX1 deletions.,C15.14,,"Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland The RBFOX1 gene encodes a protein that regulates pre  mRNA splicing in developmental genes expressed inmuscle, heart and neuronal cells. Intragenic deletions of RBFOX1 gene have been identi ï¬ed as susceptibility loci and reported in patients with aggressive behavior, conductdisorder, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder. Despite of the documented correlation with neurodevelopmental dis  orders, the deletions of RBFOX1 gene are often inheritedfrom the healthy parents, therefore the clinical interpretation of CNVs within this gene is still unclear. We applied oli  gonucleotide microarrays (OGT) in a cohort of 9430patients with neurodevelopment disorders and their healthy relatives. The analyses of genomes were performed using genome wide array to accurate detection of copy numbervariation at the exon level in RBFOX1 gene. Chromosomal analysis revealed intragenic RBFOX1 deletions in 36 patients. The differential distribution across the genebetween patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and the control group allowed to distinguished evidently pathogenic areas within the gene. Deletions of exones 1 2and 13 14 have high penetrance, and are mainly associated with conduct disorder and autism spectrum disorder.

To unravel the pathological mechanism underlying FOXP1 syndrome,we analysed Foxp1 +/  mice, which closely re ï¬ect FOXP1 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. We can show that Foxp1 +/  animals exhibit behavioural de ï¬cits such as reduced neonatal ultra  sonic vocalization, hyperactivity, anxiety and alterations in spatial navigation and memory. Furthermore, they manifest decreased exercise capacity and endurance. We also foundthat Foxp1 +/  animals display a reduced striatal expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics (Pgc 1?, Tfam, Opa1 and Drp1), suggesting that mitochon drial dysfunction may contribute to the symptoms. To address this issue in more detail, we investigated mitochondria in WT and Foxp1 +/  animals. We demonstrate that Foxp1 +/  striatal neurons display a disrupted mitochondrial membrane poten  tial. In addition, we detected an increased abundance of reactive oxygen species, increased cytochrome C release aswell as lipid peroxidation in the Foxp1 +/  striatum. In sum  mary, our results indicate mitochondrial dysfunction in mur  ine Foxp1 de ï¬ciency, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress may also con  tribute to the de ï¬cits in FOXP1 Syndrome.

On March 16, we started the GEN  COVID project ( https://sites.google.com/dbm.unisi.it/gen  covid ) aiming to collect 2,000 COVID 19 patients all over Italy, the ï¬rst 500 being already collected. Material and Methods: Aï¬rst cohort of 130 Tuscanian COVID 19 patients (100 of which hospitalised) was subjected to clinical and molecular characterisation by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). Results : Searching for common genes by Collapsing Methods against 300 WES controls of Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically signi ï¬cant results with the exception of a pair of genes, one belonging to the Olfactory Receptor families with many paralogs in thegenome. This result is not unexpected since we are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factor with a strong underlying heritability(50%). Learning the lesson of Autism Spectrum Disorder, we started to re analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following a Mendelian like model. Weidenti ï¬ed for each patient an average of 3 pathogenic mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpoint to one or more rare disorder(s); the number beinghigher in the most severely affected cases. To our knowl  edge, this is the ï¬rst report on WES and COVID 19. Our results pinpoint to a combined model for COVID 19susceptibility with a number of, yet unknown, common susceptibility genes which represent the favorite backgroundAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 121in which additional rare mutations confer to the host the best environment for virus growth and organ damage.

Esfandyarpour Genapsys Inc, Redwood City, CA, United States Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have made rapid strides in the throughput and accuracy of DNA sequencing in recent years. These advances have revolu  tionized biomedical and clinical research. Here, Genapsys presents a novel, scalable, low cost, and high accuracy NGS platform, which enables wide ranging genomicapplications. The GenapSys NGS platform is based on accurate detection of electrical impedance changes resulting fromsingle base incorporations during sequencing by synthesis. We show that impedance changes measure a steady state dNTP incorporation signal, leading to higher accuracy. Thecore of the technology is a CMOS based electronic chip that enables scalability and low instrument and consumable costs. Chips with 1M, 16M and 144M sensors can be run onthe same GenapSys instrument, giving a lab ï¬exibility in NGS assay design and sample multiplexing. We demon  strate that a single run with a 16M sensor chip generates upto 2 Gb of high accuracy data, with greater than 99% raw accuracy and average read lengths of 150 bp.We demonstrate wide ranging genomic applications of the GenapSys platform, which include whole genome sequencing of small genomes such as bacteria and viruses, whole exome sequencing of human samples, and transcrip  tomic applications. We also demonstrate that the high accuracy of the GenapSys platform makes it ideal forgermline and somatic variant calling for inherited diseases and cancer. Thus, the GenapSys NGS platform is an accurate, scalable, and low cost solution for genomicsresearch and clinical applications. S. Paliwal: A.

Introduction: Anophthalmia and microphthalmia (AM) are a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that can be isolatedor syndromic. Biallelic ALDH1A3 variants are responsible for 11% of recessive AM cases, mostly described in consanguineous families, and present severe bilateral AM with variable neurodevelopmen tal anomalies. We present six families with biallelic ALDH1A3 variants, further characterising the associated phenotype. Material and Methods: AM individuals from UK, France and Spain were analysed by WES, targeted gene screening and arrays. Results: We identi ï¬ed 6 families: Family 1) with two brothers with bilateral anophthalmia, one present additional developmen tal delay, absent speech and autism with compound heterozygousALDH1A3 variants (c.874G>T:p.(D292Y);c.1393A>T:p.(I465F)); 2) a boy with bilateral anophthalmia, developmental and intellectual delay, seizures and autistic features with compound heterozygous variants (c.845G>C:p.(G282A);c.1459A>G:p.(R487G)); 3) a girl withbilateral microphthalmia and coloboma with compound hetero zygous variants (c.847_849del;p.(G283del);c.953C>A,:p.(S318Y)); 4) a girl with bilateral anophthalmia with a homozygous missense variant (c.1144G>A:p.(G382R)); 5) a boy with bilateral microphthal mia, unilateral coloboma and cataract, with a homozygous splice variant (c.1233 +2T>C) and 6) a boy with bilateral microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, facial dysmorphism with ahomozygous missense variant (c.434C>T:p.A145V). Conclusions: Three of the six families presented with com pound heterozygous variants, highlighting this mode of inheri tance in ALDH1A3 related disorders. Five of 6 families had a variant in the catalytic domain, supporting the importance of this domain,which is critical for substrate selectivity.

269,A Diagnostic yield of WES based gene panels in patients with congenital structural heart defects a multi center study Marrit M,P05.015,," Hitzert 1,Rosalie L. Neijzen2, Dennis Dooijes2, Yvonne J. Vos1, Rosa L. E. van Loon2, Wilhelmina S. Kerstjens Frederikse1 1University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands, 2University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands. Introduction: Congenital heart defects (CHD) affect 1% of live births. A monogenetic cause can be identi ï¬ed in 5% to 10% of patients. WES based gene panels are widely used, while there isno consensus on which genes to include and which patients couldbene ï¬t most. We evaluated the diagnostic yield of WES based gene panels in CHD patients. Patients: We retrospectively evaluated the results from WES based gene panels in CHD patients in the Netherlands at theUniversity Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU). Inclusion lasted from 2013 (UMCU) and 2017 (UMCG) up until April 2020. We collectedclinical data including phenotype and family history of CHD. Results: A total of 328 patients were included with most patients having a left sided (n ,117; 35.7%) or conotruncal heart defect (n ,94; 28.7%). In 3/117 and 8/94 patients a (likely) pathogenic variant was demonstrated. Total diagnostic yield was comparable between the UMCG and the UMCU (6.2% and 6.0%, respectively) and was higher in syndromic than non syndromicpatients (12.5% vs. 5%; P,0.038). Conclusions: Our diagnostic yield of CHD gene panels as used in clinical practice (6%) is comparable to the previously reported yield in study settings (5% to 10%), and is highest in syndromicpatients.

The pathop hysiological mechanisms are still unknown. The objective of this study is to investigate if this group of patients is burdened by mutations in genes associated with ASD. Methods: We included 147 patients with an unrepaired ASD. We curated a list of ASD candidate genes, and patients wereanalyzed for genetic variants in these genes, using targeted next generation sequencing. We ï¬ltered for protein altering variants (PAVs) with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01 and predictedpathogenicity using the Combined Annotation Dependent Deple tion (CADD) method. The number of rare and pathogenic variants in cases were compared with variants identi ï¬ed in 33,370 controls of European ancestry. Results: We identi ï¬ed 384 rare (MAF < 0.01) PAVs in 59 genes. ASD patients were signi ï¬cantly enriched for very rare (MAF < 0.0001) PAVs compared to controls (P ,0.0001). The frequency of PAVs with CADD score â¥30 was signi ï¬cantly higher in ASD patients, compared to controls (P ,0.0042). Conclusions: Patients with a small, unrepaired ASD were enriched for rare PAVs within 59 ASD candidate disease genes. Our resultssuggest that recurrence risk may be increased for this group ofpatients and warrants further inve stigations. Funding: This work was supported by Novo Nordic Foundation (Grant no.

Additional clinical features include hypotonia, feeding dif ï¬culties, postnatal growth failure and dysmorphic facial features. The underlying cause of the syndrome is constitutive variants in the ASXL3 gene. We present an 10 old girl with recognized Bainbrigde Ropers syndrome andconï¬rmed variant in the ASXL3 gene. Materials and methods: During diagnostic procedure analysis of karyotyping, MLPA test (P 245), comparative genomic hybridi zation to microarray (aCGH) study and sequencing a panel of 372 genes (NGS) correlated with short stature, dysmorphic features and mental retardation were performed. Results: The cytogenetic analysis showed normal balanced female karyotype 46,XX. Molecular analyses with MLPA and aCGH methods did not reveal any genome imbalances. NGS analysis allowed identi ï¬cation of new heterozygotic variant p.Glu367Glyf sTer17 (c.1095_1096delAA) in the ASXL3 gene.

We described de novo and inherited missense and truncating variants in ITSN1 as a novel cause of neurodevelopmental disorder spectrum in a total of 8 unrelated patients. A review of the literature identi ï¬ed four additional patients from large meta analysis studies. ITSN1 plays an important role in brain develop ment including including development of dendritic spines, corticalmidline connectivity, synaptic vesicle recycling, neuronal migra tion, synaptic plasticity and more recently in learning and memory. We evidenced that missense ITSN1 variants (3/12 variants) without splicing defect predicted are spatially clusteredin C terminal in an important regional missense constraint. Missense variants are predicted probably damaging by PolyPhen 2. GnomAD database reported the intolerance of ITSN1 gene to support missense variants (misZ score ,3.61). Variants causing premature codon stop (9/12 variants) are located in the ï¬rst half of the protein. ITSN1 showed a high intolerance to inactivation reported by GnomAD database with an associated pLI(probability of loss of function intolerance) score of 1. Neurologi cal disorders were diagnosed in all patients and includedintellectual disability or global developmental delay (8/8) and autism spectrum disorders (10/11). Seizures free was noted in 2/8 patients. All patients showed speech delay and/or language impairment (8/8), three displayed a regression. Mainly patientspresented severe behavioural troubles and/or severe psychiatricdisorders. Minor and inconstant dysmorphic features were observed.

MACROD2 is a gene involved in DNA repair, cell signaling, gene transcription, and chromatin remodel ing. It is highly expressed in the ventricular zone of the brain during embryonic development. Deletions of 20p12.1 involvingMACROD2 have been associated with ASD according to several studies that preliminarily linked this gene to ASD. CASE REPORT First, in 2012, in a 12 year old patient diagnosed with ASD, a 400 K array CGH was made, resulting in a deletion of 86 Kb in 20p12.1(chr20: 14147320_14234229). This CNV was classi ï¬ed as of uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance and was not considered as the cause of the disorder. Recently, in another 3 year old patient with ASD, a genetic study was carried out using a 180K CGH array,ï¬nding a 0.265 Mb deletion in 20p12.1 (chr20: 14776880_15041538) in the MACROD2 gene. In both cases, the deletions were inherited from healthy mothers, so these altera tions could have incomplete penetrance and high phenotypicvariability. Discussion: Based on these cases and others previously reported [Lombardo et al., 2019; Frye et al., 2016], where deletionsin 20p12.1 are found in non syndromic boys with ASD, it would benecessary to review old cases in which no cause effect was found between the deletion and the disorder.",2021.0,,F.

The Tousled Like Kinases 1 and 2 (TLK1 and TLK2) are involved in many fundamental processes, including DNA replication, cell cycle checkpoint recovery and chromatin remodeling. Variants in TLK2 were associated with âMental Retardation Autosomal Dominant 57â(MRD57), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a highly variable phenotype, including intellectual disability, beha vioral abnormalities, facial dysmorphisms, microcephaly, epilepsy, and skeletal anomalies. By whole exome sequencing and array CGH analysis, we identi ï¬ed three unrelated MRD57 cases. Two were sporadic and caused by a missense change (c.1652A>G; p. (Asp551Gly)) and a 39 kb deletion encompassing TLK2 , and one was familial with three affected siblings who inherited a nonsensechange from an affected mother (c.1423G>T; p.(Glu475Ter)). Using spatial proteomics (BioID) and single cell gel electrophoresis, we investigated the proximity interaction landscape of TLK2 and analyzed the effects of p.(Asp551Gly) and a previously reportedmissense variant (c.1850C>T; p.(Ser617Leu)) on TLK2 interactions, localization and activity. Proximal interactions between TLK2 and other factors implicated in neurological disorders, including CHD7,CHD8, BRD4, NACC1, were identi ï¬ed. Notably, most of these interactions were altered by the analyzed missense variants, as well as TLK2 kinase activity and localization. Furthermore, we demonstrated a more relaxed chromatin state in lymphoblastoidcells harboring the p.(Asp551Gly) variant compared to control cells, conferring susceptibility to DNA damage. Overall, our study identi ï¬ed novel patients carrying pathogenic variants con ï¬rming and further expanding MRD57 related phenotype.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorders or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorders (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorders without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

However, WES cost is often an obstacle for pursuing this option. We evaluated the yield of publicly funded clinical WES, performed in a single tertiary referral centerduring a three year period (2018 2020). All index cases had thefollowing: (1) moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) (intelligence quotient [IQ]/developmental quotient [DQ] â¤55); or (2) mild to moderate ID (IQ/DQ<70) with epilepsy or congenitalanomaly; or (3) MCA. Only subjects with normal chromosomal microarray analysis results who met inclusion criteria, were offered to participate. Overall, 280 consecutive families were included. In250 (89.3%) families, the index case had NDD. In 252 of the families(90.0%), a trio WES was performed. Molecular diagnosis was reached in 115 (41.1%) families, mainly due to de novo mutations (92/115, 80.0%). Disease causing variants were identi ï¬ed in a total of 102 genes, ï¬fteen of which were implicated in more than a single family. Both paternal and maternal age at pregnancy were older in families with a de novo mutation, compared to all other cases. Yield was lower in families with premature birth compared to birth at term.Other demographic and clinical variables (including multiply affected family, coexistence of epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, abnormal brain imaging or microcephaly) were not signi ï¬cantly associated with WES yield. Taken together, our ï¬ndings support WES utility in a real world setting, as part of a publicly funded genetic work up for NDD and/or MCA.",2021.0,,B. Pode Shakked: None. O. Barel: None. A.

In the case of the formation of a circular chromosome without loss of material, the phenotype remains normal, but thereis a risk of microdeletion in the offspring. Patients with PMD areusually seen with a diagnosis of undifferentiated mental retarda tion or autism. Materials and Methods: a clinical case of Phelan McDermid syndrome in a child with undifferentiated mental retardation. Clinical genealogical, syndromic, cytogenetic, molecular genetic methods were used. Results: A six year old girl with undifferentiated mental retardation was referred for genetic counseling. Previously observed by a pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, psychiatrist for microcephaly, delayed statokinetic and psychoverbal develop ment. Girl phenotype: dolichocephaly, high forehead, ï¬attening of the middle part of the face, deep set eyes, full and puffy eyelids, long eyelashes, hypertelorism, full cheeks, enlarged ears.

Introduction: Nine de novo loss of function and a single missense variant in the QRICH1 gene have previously been reported in individuals with developmental delay, autism, short stature, facial dysmorphism and chondrodysplasia. We present 27 additionalindividuals with QRICH1 related neurodevelopmental disorder to further delineate the spectrum of clinical features and genetic variants contributing to this emerging autosomal dominant syndrome. Methods: Phenotypic and molecular data from 27 previously unreported individuals with QRICH1 variants were gathered through international collaboration and compared to those of the 10 previously reported individuals. Results: Frequent phenotypic features included mild to moderate developmental delay/intellectual disability (70%), facial dysmorphism (84%), short stature (41%), poor weight gain (41%)and hypotonia (49%). Additional ï¬ndings were seizures (24%), minor structural brain abnormalities (24%) and scoliosis (19%). Twenty seven individuals had truncating or splice variants, and 10 had missense variants. Four variants were inherited from a mildlyaffected parent. Individuals with missense variants were morelikely to report early language delay as compared to those with loss of function variants (10/10 vs 14/27, p value ,0.005). Conclusion: In addition to the known neurodevelopmental features and short stature, we expand the phenotypic spectrum ofQRICH1 associated disorders to include poor weight gain, hypotonia, minor structural brain anomalies, scoliosis and seizures. Inherited variants from mildly affected parents are reported forthe ï¬rst time, suggesting variable expressivity. Aside from language delay, there were no other statistically signi ï¬cant phenotypic differences between individuals with missense var iants as compared to loss of function variants.

Introduction: Loss of function variants in SETD5 gene cause the core phenotype of 3p25.3 microdeletion syndrome characterized by intellectual disability/autism, slow growth, dysmorphic featuresand malformations such as postaxial polydactyly, heart conditionand genitourinary anomalies. However, the prognosis seems to be milder in cases with intragenic SETD5 variants. Until now, only 15 cases have been described. Material and methods: Descriptive retrospective collaborative study of Spanish children with de novo intragenic variants in SETD5 gene. Results: 9 cases collected (3 females/6 males). Mean age: 6 years old (1.5 15). Prenatal anomalies: 3/9 single umbilical artery,2/9 growth retardation and nuchal edema. Postnatally: all showed some neurodevelopment disorder but two presented normal intelligence and the language skills improved gradually. 2/9hypotonia, 1/9 seizures. Growth was normal in 8/9 cases; 3/9 microcephaly. Congenital malformations: 5/9 had heart disease, 2/ 9 genitourinary anomalies and 6/9 digital anomalies (2 poly dactyly). The main facial features were: trianglar face, arched/thick/unusual eyebrows, low nasal bridge, anteverted/thick nares and long/smooth philtrum. Molecular data: variants wereidenti ï¬ed by exome sequencing; all of them were protein truncating variants: 4 nonsense, 4frameshift and one affecting a splice donor site; 2/9 previously described. Conclusions: Our results support that hypotonia and micro cephaly are uncommon and neurological prognosis is much betterin these cases than in the 3p25.3 deletion syndrome. Digital anomalies in addition to polydactyly were common so it must be taken into account.Thus, SETD5 gene haploinsuf ï¬ciency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of KBG, Cornelia de Langeand Cof ï¬n Siris syndrome.",2021.0,,M.

Chromosome 17p13.3 is a region of genomic instability due to extensive LCRs which make it vulnerable to copy number variations. Depending on whether a deletion or a duplication of17p13.3 occurs, different rare neurodevelopmental disorders arise.Phenotypic features of 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome (MIM #613275) include developmental and psychomotor delay, beha vioral problems, distinct physical features, postnatal overgrowthand ASD, as well as limb malformations and cleft lip and palate.Genes thorough this region; CRK, PAFAH1B1 , and YWHAE have crucial roles in neuronal migration and contribute to each of these genetic disorders. BHLAH9 located within chromosome 17p13.3, but immediately outside of the Miller Dieker Syndrome criticalregion, seems to be necessary but not suf ï¬cient, for limb malformation. Depending on the genes involved, patients with duplications in this region may be categorized into either class I or class II. Individuals in class I have microduplications of the YWHAE , but not PAFAH1B1 and generally, result in learning disabilities, autism, and developmental delays. Individuals in class II always have microduplications of the PAFAH1B1 gene, which may include YWHAE and other genetic gains. Class II microduplications generally result in smaller body size, developmental delays,microcephaly, and other brain malformations.

Forthe remaining 10 genes, the germline transmission of the mutation failed despite multiple attempts or no mouse model was available during the course of the study. Result: Here we showthat multiple genes mapping to this region regulate brain size incontrast to previous studies, with female signi ï¬cantly less affected. Major Vault Protein (MVP), the main component of the vault organelle, is a highly conserved protein found in higher and lowereukaryotic cells, yet its function is not understood. While we ï¬nd MVP expression highly speci ï¬c to the limbic system, Mvp stood out as the top driver of NAPs, regulating the morphology ofneurons, postnatally and speci ï¬cally in male. Finally, we demon strate that the double hemideletion Mvp::Mapk3 rescues NAPs and alters behavioral performances, suggesting that MVP and ERK share the same pathway, in vivo. Conclusion: Our results highlight that sex speci ï¬c neuroanato mical mechanisms must be considered in neurological disorders such as autism and provide the ï¬rst evidence for the involvement of the vault organelle in the regulation of the mammalian brainsize.",2021.0,,B.

Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families. The identi ï¬ed biallelic damaging variants could affect the CACNA1H protein activity with a recessive model and contribute to the disease development in the context of a high risk genetic background. Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.Supported by the Italian Ministry of Health (Grant GR 2013 02357561).",2021.0,,M.

Different genetic models could explain ASD, ranging from monogenic disorder or copy number variation to polygenic disease. Mito chondrial DNA (mtDNA) may have a role in the pathogenesis ofASD. Materials and Methods: Our cohort consists of 98 families including 117 subjects with ASD, 193 parents and 59 unaffectedsiblings. We performed deep sequencing of mtDNA, de ï¬ning haplogroups and evaluating private variants, including those at low heteroplasmy. An independent cohort of 127 Italian families was used as a replica. Both these cohorts were compared to a controlgroup of 5088 healthy individuals. MtDNA content was assessed inblood cells. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate risk factors inï¬uencing ASD severity classi ï¬ed by the calibrated severity score of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Results: Haplogroup H in probands resulted protective for ASD, counterbalanced by increased risk conferred by haplogroups L and I. Paternal haplogroups U5a and K increased the risk ofdeveloping ASD in offspring. Probands showed increased numberof missense mutations in MT ATP6 and MT ATP8 and reduced mtDNA content. Paternal super haplogroups H and JT are associated with mild phenotypes, whereas variants with 15% 5%heteroplasmy are associated with severe phenotypes. Conclusions: Our results indicate a contribution of mtDNA to ASD susceptibility and phenotypic expression. Paternal mtDNA inï¬uences the ASD pathogenesis, possibly due to accumulation of nuclear de novo variants or epigenetic alterations in fathers â germinal cells that are transmitted to the offspring.

A number of geneshave been associated with rare autosomal dominant and severe sporadic forms of epilepsy; however, the underlying cause of epilepsy remains unknown in the majority of cases. Copy numbervariants (CNV) are increasingly recognised as an importantaetiology of many human neurodevelopmental disorders, includ ing epilepsy. Materials and Methods: A whole genome oligonucleotide microarray (Agilent Technologies 60K and 180K) was applied to acohort of 239 unrelated patients phenotypically characterised with various type of epilepsy with or without other neurodevelop mental disorders such as developmental delay, intellectualdisability, autism, or others. Results: The chromosomal microarray analysis revealed CNVs considered pathogenic in 43 (18.0%) of affected individuals,ranging from 3.7 kb to 16.9 Mb in size. Of these, 7/43 (16.3%)patients had CNVs in the epilepsy/neurodevelopmental disorder âhotspots â(15q13.3, 15q11 âq13, 16p11.2, and 16p13.11), and 4/43 (9.3%) patients have at least two potentially causative CNVs. Weidenti ï¬ed novel CNVs in genes previously implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders ( L1CAM ) as well as epileptic encephalopathy ( DENND5A ). In addition, we identi ï¬ed CNVs of uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance in 18/239 (7.5%) of cases. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings correspond with the data reported worldwide and highlight the importance of the whole genome microarray testing in paediatric population with epilepsy with orwithout other neurodevelopmental features.

Purpose : Phosphatidylinositol Glycan Anchor Biosynthesis, class G (PIGG) is an ethanolamine phosphate transferase catalyzing themodi ï¬cation of the second mannose of glycosylphosphatidylino sitol (GPI). GPIs serve as anchors on the cell membrane by linking over 150 surface proteins called GPI anchored proteins (GPI APs)on their third mannose. Pathogenic variants in genes involved inthe biosynthesis of GPI cause inherited GPI de ï¬ciency (IGD) which still needs to be further characterized. Methods: We describe twenty two individuals from nineteen new unrelated families with bi allelic variants in PIGG .W ea n a l y z e dG P I A P surface levels on granulocytes and ï¬broblasts for three and two individuals, respectively. We demonstrated enzymatic activity defectsforPIGG variants in vitro in a PIGG /PIGO double knockout system. Results: Phenotypic analysis of reported individuals reveals novel PIGG de ï¬ciency associated features. All tested GPI APs wereunchanged on granulocytes whereas FLAER and CD73 levels in ï¬broblasts were decreased. In addition to common symptoms such as hypotonia, intellectual disability/developmental delay, and seizures, individuals with PIGG variants of null or severelydecreased activity showed cerebellar abnormalities, neurologicalmanifestations, and mitochondrial dysfunction, a feature increas ingly recognized in IGDs. Individuals with mildly decreased activity variants showed autism spectrum disorder. Conclusion: This in vitro system is a useful method to validate the pathogenicity of new variants in PIGG and to study PIGG physiological functions. Recent work using this system has identi ï¬ed a new subset of PIGG dependent GPI APs with an alternative bridging on the second mannose.

Introduction : Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are charac terized by genetics and phenotypic heterogeneity. Thus, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) studies combined with a clinical evaluation can be a powerful approach maximizing moleculardiagnostic yield. Heterozygous pathogenetic variants in POGZ gene have been associated to a syndromic NDD, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID) and some dysmorphic facial features. Material and methods : A multicentric, Italian WES data sharing has been carried out with the aim of providing a complete clinical and neurocognitive picture of patients with a similar phenotypic characteristic (a diagnosis of POGZ related disorder), and negativeto SNPs/CGH molecular karyotyping. Result, new perspectives : All collected cases resembling a POGZ related disorder (n ,13; 8 male) presented with ID (from mild to severe), a global DD, usually exhibited behaviouralimpairments and, in ï¬ve cases, a diagnosis of ASD. The identi ï¬ed, novel pathogenetic or likely pathogenetic variant in POGZ include frameshift (5), stop (3), splicing (2) and missense (1) variants,mostly occurring de novo , except for a familiar case (3 subjects). Considering the unmet medical needs for most life longing NDDs and recent evidences on the improvement of behavioural impairments in POGZ knock in mice, we propose new careperspectives through the inhibition of glutamatergic signal and the mitigation of excitatory neurons. A recruitment of patients with POGZ related disorder is dare for ongoing.

The genetic architecture underlying psychiatric and neurological disorders is remarkably complex and highly polygenic. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) trained on summary statistics from genome wide association studies (GWAS) for these are thereforegenerally underpowered and capture only a fraction of the estimated heritable variation. However, many psychiatric and neurological disorders are geneti cally correlated with behavioral and cognitive traits that have been the focus of large GWAS.PRSs for correlated traits can therefore be used to improve prediction accuracy of relate d outcomes (Krapohl et al., Mol Psych 2018). Here, we make use of 940 GWAS summary statistics for a variety of diseases and traits to train PRS for 50 psychiatric and neurological disorders and related subtypes in IPSYCH (Bybjerg Grauholm et al., medRxiv 2020). We generated the 940 PRS usingLDpred2 auto (PrivÃ© et al., Bioinformatics 2020), which does not require any validation data to ï¬t hyper parameters. We then use these as covariates for two multiPRSs prediction models, penalizedregression and gradient boosted trees We observe that multiPRS can drastically boost the predic tion accuracy compared to marginal (single outcome) PRS. For instance, the prediction R2 (adjusted for sex, age, and20 genetic PCs) for the three most prevalent psychiatricdisorders in the IPSYCH cohort ADHD, autism, and depression was 1.1%, 0.4%, and 2.6% when using the single outcome PRS (excluding IPSYCH samples), and 9.1%, 4.0%, and 4.3%respectively using multiPRS.

Introduction: Rare disorders refer to a group of diseases that affect less than 200,000 people in the United States or less than 2,000 people in Europe. These diseases, although individually rare,are generally prevalent. It has been estimated that there are about7000 rare genetic diseases that the genetic cause is recognized for about half. Many of them affect the nervous system; causing some common phenotypes including intellectual disability, autism,epilepsy, ataxia, muscular dystrophy and neuropathy. Recentadvances in molecular approaches like next generation sequen cing (NGS) make it possible to reach an accurate molecular and subsequently clinical diagnosis for patients with presumed raregenetic disorders who remained previously undiagnosed. Materials and methods: 20 families with an undiagnosed rare genetic disorder were studied by whole exome sequencing (WES). Results: 18 causative variants in genes ( LARP7(2), TWNK, L2HGDH, UNC80, ANO10, TRRAP, STAMBP, MAP3K20, ZNF142, TAF2, WDR81, CHRNE, EFTUD2, SPTBN2 ,MAN1B1 ,BCL11B and DIAPH3 ) have been detected by WES in 15 families but no candidate variants were identi ï¬ed in 4 families and one family is under study by using whole genome sequencing (WGS).

SHANK2 mutations have been consistently associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the speci ï¬c consequences of these mutations at the molecular/cellular level, including the cell types/developmental stages that are crucially relevant for thephenotype, remain unclear. A fundamental question is whetherthe affected processes are limited to synapse formation/function, or if the pathobiology of the disorder starts earlier, either in differentiating neurons or already in neuronal progenitors. Wehave reprogrammed ï¬broblasts from a trio âtwo neurotypical parents and their daughter diagnosed with ASD, harboring a de novo 120 kb deletion in SHANK2 âinto induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and subsequently differentiated them into neuralstem cells (NSCs). For comparison, we used four additional iPSC lines: one derived from a patient with a heterozygous nonsense mutation in SHANK2 (R841X), a CRISPR/Cas9 engineered homo zygous SHANK2 knockout line, and their respective isogenic controls. Interestingly, only the NSCs derived from the deletion patient presented a strikingly different morphology, whereas the other SHANK2 deï¬cient lines were indistinguishable from wildtype cells. Moreover, the SHANK2 deletion NSCs showed a tendency towards premature differentiation into neurons. The discrepancy between the phenotypes, coupled with comparable SHANK2 levels in the deletion patient and controls, suggests that thealtered phenotype might be caused by genetic factors indepen dent of SHANK2 expression. In fact, this SHANK2 deletion removes not only exon 16, but also a large portion of the adjacent intron.This region harbors numerous enhancers hypothesized to berelevant for general neural differentiation, and their deletion could contribute to the observed phenotype.",2021.0,,F.B.

A male patient was carrying 2 maternally inherited variants, one hemizygous in BCOR and one heterozygous inMYO9B , genes associated to cognitive and behaviour impair ment. A third heterozygous paternally inherited variant affected HTR1E , a serotonin receptor hypothesized to play a role in autism like behaviour and sleep disturbance. The second case, anothermale patient, had 2 maternally inherited variants, one hemizygousinZC4H2 , associated to developmental delay, and one hetero zygous in ALDH5A1 , associated to behaviour and sleep impair ment. A further paternally inherited variant affected CPLX3 , involved in neurotransmitter release, hypothesized to be impli cated in neurodevelopmental delay. Implicated genes revealed enrichment in ASD associated biological processes and pathways.As our previously described patient, these two patients presentedcomplex ASD phenotype.Conclusions : About 10% of patients from our ASD cohort showed rare deleterious variants in multiple genes that seem to fully explain their complex phenotype.",2021.0,,M.

Pathogenic variants in MAGEL2 are associated with Chitayat Hall (CHS), Schaaf Yang (SYS) and Prader Willi (PWS) syndromes. Schaaf Yang Syndrome is characterised by neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, feeding problems ininfancy, joint contractures and autism spectrum disorder, sharingclinical overlap with Prader Willi Syndrome and Chitayat Hall syndrome. Truncating variants in the maternally imprinted MAGEL2 gene have been identi ï¬ed in patients with SYS. A neuromuscular gene panel analysis was requested on a two week old male infant, requiring respiratory support, with hypotonia, bilateral talipes and central apnoeas. No variants explaining the patient âs phenotype were initially found, but subsequent reanalysis of the exome identi ï¬ed a truncating variant in the MAGEL2 gene. Familial studies showed this variant to be paternally inherited and also con ï¬rmed this variant in the paternal grandmother, consistent with the inheritance pattern of Schaaf Yang Syndrome due to imprinted inheritance. Following this ï¬nding, the MAGEL2 gene was added to our standard neuromuscular panel. To date, only one additionalvariant has been identi ï¬ed in MAGEL2 , an in frame deletion of 30 nucleotides.

We show that this is an ambiguous de ï¬nition that leads to two different interpretations. One interpretation is used byclinicians and counsellors (essentially âthe likelihood that the variant will cause a phenotype â). A different mathematical interpretation has been used to calculate penetrance based on Bayes âtheorem (essentially âthe likelihood the variant may been seen in association with a phenotype â). The latter de ï¬nition encompasses individuals who have the variant by chance associated with but not causal of the phenotype. The interpreta tions are incompatible. As a result, many of the publishedpenetrance estimates for neurosusceptibility loci, intellectual disability, schizophrenia and autism are overestimated. Methods: We provide a mathematical rationale for a more clinically meaningful formula for estimating penetrance. We alsoimprove the data used in the formula. We justify our approach in changing the background rate of any physical or intellectual disability from 5.12% used by some authors, to 1.1% forintellectual disability. This results in penetrance estimations for neurosusceptibility loci that are approximately 5 fold lower in some instances. Results: When the two approaches are combined, we ï¬nd that the penetrance for most neurosusceptibility loci are markedly decreased. Some previously low penetrant neurosusceptibility loci are recalculated as having a penetrance of 0%. Conclusion: Most neurosusceptibility loci have a lower penetrance than previously estimated.

1097,D Comparison of methods of genotyping short tandem repeats (STRs) from whole genome sequences John W,P17.069,," Oketch , Louise V. Wain, Edward J. Hollox University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom. Short tandem repeats (STRs) are repeated regions of genomes that consist of a simple sequence motif 2 6 bp tandemly repeated multiple times. Variations in STRs c ause over 40 monogenic disorders including Huntington disease. In addition, STRs are known to affect gene expression levels and have been implicated in complex diseases for example autism. How ever, STRs remain understudied owing to dif ï¬culties and precision of genotyping STRs at a large scale. Recently, new tools to genotype STRs from short read genome sequences have become available, including STRetch, GangSTR and HipSTR. To assess their applicability to large cohorts of genomesequences sequenced at ~30x, this pilot study compared the toolsusing seven gold standard huma n genome sequences from the Genome in a Bottle consortium, inc luding two parent child trios. These individuals have also been sequenced using long readtechnologies.First, STR calls were made at initial genome coverage of 100x or 300x using the recommended tool speci ï¬cs e to f reference STRs. Secondly, we downsampled the genomes to 30x coverage and repeated our analys is.The number of genotypes calls made by Stretch varied by coverage from as low as 2310 (at 30x coverage) to ~16,000 (300x) . HipSTR and GangSTR reported consistent number of calls ~1.4x1 0^6 at each coverage with about 70% overlaps between the calls. A bout 92% of calls made by HipSTR and 97% by GangSTR followed Mendelian inheritance patterns indicating high robustness in genotype calls.We aim to use the selected tools on large case control cohorts, by investigating thegenomewide association of STRs with complex respiratory disease.Abstracts from the 54thEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference 500 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:88 â 608J.W.

Although the introduction of whole exome sequencing (WES) has led to the diagnosis of a signi ï¬cant portion of patients with intellectual disability (ID), the yield in actual clinical practice hasremained stable in the last few years at approximately 30%. We hypothesize that improving the selection of patients to test based on their phenotypic presentation will increase diagnostic yield andtherefore reduce unnecessary genetic testing. In the current study,we tested four machine learning methods to predict the probability of a positive WES. From these, we developed PredWES: a statistical model predicting the probability of a positive WESresult solely based on the phenotype of a patient. We ï¬rst trained the tool on 1,431 patients with ID using nested cross validation. We subsequently show that diagnostic WES on the top 10% of patients with the highest probability of a positive WES resultwould provide a diagnostic yield of 57%, leading to a notably 86%increase. On the other end of the spectrum, the 90% of patients with the 10% lowest scores were correctly predicted to have a negative WES result. Inspection of our model revealed that forpatients with ID, comorbid abnormal (lower) muscle tone positively correlated with the prediction for a conclusive WES diagnosis, whereas autism was negatively associated with amolecular diagnosis. In conclusion, PredWES allows prioritizingpatients eligible for diagnostic WES testing based on their phenotypic presentation to increase the relative diagnostic yield for intellectual disability, as such, making a more ef ï¬cient use of health care resources.",2021.0,,A.J.M.

Background :AARS2 is a nuclear gene encoding the mitochondrial enzyme alanyl tRNA synthetase. Bi allelic mutations in AARS2 are known causes of early onset cardiomyopathy or late onset leuko dystrophy. Until very recently, the p.Arg592Trp variant, either in thehomozygous or compound heterozygous state, has been exclusively and repeatedly described in infants with severe cardiomyopathy or primary pulmonary hypoplasia, both resulting in death before theage of 1 year.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes. Collectively, the cross disorder rCNV maps and metrics derived here set the foundation for future studies of dosage sensitivity throughout the human genome.",2021.0,,R.L. Collins: None. J.T.

11," Leveraging public epigenomic datasets to examine the role of regulatory variation in complex traits Sushmita Roy University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, USA",S01.2,," Many variants identi ï¬ed by genome wide association studies (GWAS) occur in non coding sequences. Understanding theimpact of such variants on complex phenotypes is a signi ï¬cant challenge. This is because such regulatory variants can affect the expression of gene hundreds of kilobases away, and the targetgenes themselves are part of a larger unknown biological pathway. High throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technologies that measure the three dimensional proximityof genomic loci at high resolution (e.g. 5kb) can be used to linkgenes to regulatory variants over long distances, but they exist only for a handful of model cell lines due to high sequencing costs. We have developed a computational framework forpredicting such data, comprising (1) a Random Forest basedregression model to predict in silico contact counts of pairs of genomic loci, and (2) a multi task subnetwork identi ï¬cation approach to identify potential pathways targeted by a set ofvariants from a GWAS study. Our count prediction approach takes as input one dimensional signals such as histone modi ï¬cations, chromatin accessibility and accessible sequence motifs ofarchitectural proteins such as CTCF and predicts the contactcount for pairs of regions. We trained our approach on ï¬ve high resolution Hi C datasets and applied the trained models to 55 human cell lines and tissues from the Roadmap Epigenomics6 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 â 87project using both measured and imputed features. Our predic tions, when aggregated to a lower resolution (e.g. 40kb), accurately recapitulate the measured low resolution contact count, as well as identify larger units of 3D chromosomeorganization. Signi ï¬cant interactions from our predicted counts are associated with increased gene expression and enriched for interactions from ChIA PET experiments. We used our compen dium of signi ï¬cant interactions to predict target genes of regulatory SNPs associated with traits from the NHGRI GWAScatalog. We applied our multi task graph clustering approach to identify subsets of cell types associated with a phenotype of interest, e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia.We found that the subnetworks are enriched for processes thatare relevant to the phenotype of interest (e.g. SNPs associated with ASD and schizophrenia are enriched for cognition, associative and visual learning and regulation of nerve impulse in fetal brainand fetal spinal cord tissue). Taken together, our analysis pipeline offers a powerful resource to study three dimensional genome organization in a large number of cell lines and interpret the roleof regulatory variation in complex phenotypes.",2021.0,,S.

37," Epigenetic signatures in overgrowth syndromes Rosanna Weksberg 1,2 1The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,2University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",S18.2,," Every cell in our body has the same DNA. Yet different cell types in the body are able to develop because epigenetic marks, placed on top of the DNA, direct each cell type to read only speci ï¬c sections of the DNA. There are several types of epigenetic marks includingDNA methylation (DNAm), and histone modi ï¬cations. These marks orchestrate normal developmental processes via the expression of several hundred epigenes (genes that function in epigeneticregulation). Rapid advances in genomic research have led to the identi ï¬cation of over 60 epigenes which are associated with Mendelian disorders, many of which are characterized byovergrowth and dysregulation of neurodevelopment. We andothers have identi ï¬ed highly speci ï¬c and highly sensitive genome wide DNAm signatures for several of these epigenes including DNMT3A, NSD1, EZH2/EED, and CHD8; mutations inthese genes are associated with Tatton Brown Rahman, Sotos,Weaver, and Autism syndromes, respectively. These DNAm signatures can be used as a âsecond tier âanalysis to improve molecular diagnostics by classifying sequence variants of uncer tain signi ï¬cance (VUS) as either benign or pathogenic with efï¬cacy far superior to most in silico programs. They can also be used for ï¬rst tier diagnostics when sequencing is uninformative. However, given the fact that DNAm signatures are still indevelopment, DNAm based disorder classi ï¬cation in this situation must be con ï¬rmed by sequencing to authenticate a molecular diagnosis. In addition to the utility of DNAm signatures formolecular diagnostics, we have also shown that gene speci ï¬c DNAm signatures re ï¬ect the functional pathophysiology of the associated genetic disorders providing opportunities to identify potential novel therapeutic targets.",2021.0,,R.

Introduction: Deletion 1p36 (del1p36) syndrome is the most common human disorder resulting from a terminal autosomal deletion. This condition is molecularly and clinically heteroge neous. Deletions involving two non overlapping regions, knownas the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are suf ï¬cient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorph isms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region.25 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 â 87Materials and Methods: We used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to de ï¬ne a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that over lap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. Results: The clinical pro ï¬le of this disease includes develop mental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention de ï¬cit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrowpalate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especiallyin females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affectedfemales, providing further evidence of a speci ï¬c contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome speci ï¬c episignature that classi ï¬es syndromic traits. Conclusions: We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsuf ï¬ciency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric tothe previously established 1p36 critical regions.",2021.0,,F.

VilhjÃ¡lmsson1 1Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark,2University of Queensland, Bribane, Australia. Introduction: Family history, sex and age at diagnosis are informative variables that are often overlooked in genetic analysissuch as GWAS, which typically restricts the analysis to the case control binary phenotype. We aim to develop new method that provides a re ï¬ned phenotype to improve power in GWAS by including information on these variables. Materials and Methods : Here we present LT FH ++,aï¬exible method for estimating a re ï¬ned phenotype for GWAS that accounts for family history, age at diagnosis and sex. We applyLT FH++ to the iPSYCH and UK Biobank cohorts by using extra information from Danish health registers for iPSYCH, and data from the British Of ï¬ce for National Statistics for studying mortality in the UK Biobank. Results from the LT FH ++ model are compared with the liability threshold conditional on family history(LT FH) model and case control status. Results: In simulations, LT FH ++ showed a power increase of up to 17.8% over LT FH and 60.6% over case control status. Wefurther applied LT FH ++ to mortality in the UK biobank and four common psychiatric disorders (ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, and depression) available in the IPSYCH cohort. Across all analyzedtraits, we found 20 independent genome wide signi ï¬cant associations for LT FH ++, 10 for LT FH and 8 for case control status across all traits. Conclusion: Linking genetic data with information on family history, sex and age at diagnosis can signi ï¬cantly increase power in GWAS. As more genetic data is linked with electronic health records, we expect methods such as LT FH ++ to become more bene ï¬cial and widely used.",2021.0,,E.M. Pedersen: None. E. Agerbo: None. O.
