Incomplete penetrance of theaffected genes and variable expressivity usually is indicated as cause of clinical features. Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ï¬rst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities. Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ï¬cant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ï¬cance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ï¬rmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet. Five disease related genes arelocated in affected region and only haploinsuf ï¬ciency sen sitive TBX6 has indirect effect on neural development. V. Å liuas: None. B. Aleksiuniene: None. E.

These patients share common clinical features including early onset obesity, intellectual disabili ty and behavioral troubles or autism. A minimal critical region of 1.97 Mb has been estimated, encompassing seven genes (SH3HYL1 , ACP1, TMEM18 , SNTG2, TPO, PXDN, and MYT1L). Many recent studies pointed out MYT1L gene as the main candidate for ID and obesity. We present three new pa tients carrying 2p25 deletions: an autist female child with developmental delay and her depressive father, and a third unrelated patient who has psy chomotor retardation and behavioral troubles. Moreover, our patients do not have an overweight phenotype, highlighting indeed the role of MYT1L in obesity, as none of the deletions encompasses MYT1L. The only common disrupted gene is SNTG2, thus redefining the smallest region of overlap for autism. SNTG2 is expressed in brain. Its product interacts with neuroligins NLGN3, NLGN4X, and NLGN4Y, which are autism related isoforms. Finally, the parental origin of the deletions seems to be of interest, as all inherited deletions described today appear to be inherited from the paternal side. We will discuss the possible imprinting of the 2p25 region and its role in au tism. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2015 | GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UK | WWW. ESHG.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human disease. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ï¬ciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P,3.72x10 â6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ï¬ne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ï¬cient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ï¬ed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorder. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ï¬cant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ï¬ed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ï¬ned 3,006 haploinsuf ï¬cient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes. Collectively, the cross disorder rCNV maps and metrics derived here set the foundation for future studies of dosage sensitivity throughout the human genome.",2021,,,"These dosage sensitivity scores classi ï¬ed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ï¬cient and triplosensitive genes.",child with autism,,child,

Tran scriptomic profiling has revealed consistently altered signatures in autistic brains. These include a program of 3 27 nucleotide Ã¢ÂÂmicroexonsÃ¢ÂÂ, which is misregulated in the brains of individuals with autism. Relative to all other types of alternative splicing, microexons display the most striking evolutionary conservation and switch like regulation during neuronal differentiation. These microexons modulate the function of inter action domains of proteins involved in neurogenesis and are modulated by neuronal activity. Most neural microexons are regulated by the neuronal specific splicing factor nSR100/SRRM4 through its binding to adjacent in tronic enhancer motifs, and reduced levels of this protein are also observed in autistic brains. Collectively, these results provide evidence that misregu lation of a splicing network affected by neuronal activity is associated with associated with autism.",2016,,,"These include a program of 3 27 nucleotide Ã¢ÂÂmicroexonsÃ¢ÂÂ, which is misregulated in the brains of individuals with autism.",individual with autism,,individual,

CMA interpretation depends on databases as ClinGen, DECIPHER and others, which lack information, and original papers are still essential in deciphering thesigniï¬cance of microdeletions/microduplications. We pre sent an 8.5 years old boy, with intractable epilepsy, autism, hypotonia during infancy, stra bismus and behavioral problems. Multiple EEG examina tions revealed frequent generalized interictal and ictal slow spike & wave discharges. He has various seizure types, andis treated with a combination of valproic acid, clobazam and ethusuximide with a relative improvement but partial con trol. The child exhibited behavioral problems includingaggression and violence, with recurrent rage attacks. Levetiractam administration escalated the frequency of these behaviors signi ï¬cantly, and therefore was dis continued. Metabolic workup was normal including: lactic, ammonia, blood amino acids, Carnitine, Acylcarnitine. A chromosomal microarray performed demonstrated a dele tion on chromosome 6: arr[hg19]6q22.1(117,431,000 118,040,939)x1. This 609kb deletion including the NUS1 gene is located within the minimal essential critical regionon chromosome 6q22. The region is known for autism, seizures, tremor and mild dysmorphic features, but less known for behavioural problems as in the case presented. The databases mentioned had only scarce information on the microdeletion, and we found only one paper interpreting it. This work further delineates this rare genetic disorder. We suggest that behavioral problems are part of this microdeletion, and suggest caution using Levetiractam in these patients.

Here, we re port a third case of pure de novo 20q13.33 deletion in a boy presenting with autism. Metabolic evaluation and standard karyotype were reported as nor mal, as was FMR1 molecular analysis. The Human Genome Microarray CGH 180K from AgilentÃÂ® used for array CGH analyses revealed an interstitial de letion of at least 556 kb in the 20q13.33 region (arr20q13.33(61,229,038 61,785,825)x1, hg18). This deletion encompassed 21 genes including CHR NA4 and KCNQ2 . These genes are interesting candidate genes in the autistic www.eshg.org Abstracts European Human Genetics Conference 2012109 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters phenotype since they have been reported in association with entities with exclusive neurological manifestations such as epilepsy. The frequent associa tion between epileptic and autistic phenotypes suggests that these disease may share common predisposing genes. Interestingly, a de novo 20q13.33 duplication encompassing CHRNA4 and KCNQ2 in a girl with autism has also been reported. This study underlines that copy number variations of the 20q13.33 region can cause autism and emphasizes the importance of array CGH in the genetic work up of patients with autism.",2012,,,This study underlines that copy number variations of the 20q13.33 region can cause autism and emphasizes the importance of array CGH in the genetic work up of patients with autism.,patient with autism,,patient,

Microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) has pro vides a relatively quick method to scan the genome for gains and loses of chromosomal material. This new methodologies have led to identification of novel genomic disorder in patients with developmental delay/mental retardation and/or multiple congenital anomalies (DD/MR/MCA), with a significant increase in diagnostic yield .In this study we present the result of array CGH obtained in 150 children with normal karyotype but DD/MR/MCA. The array CGH 60K from agilent platform was performed. In 34 patients (22,66%) was detected a chromosomal deletion or duplicati on previously described like pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs),. In 15 cases (10%) was necessary the analysis of parental samples, showing that 6 anomalies (40%) had occurred de novo and was classified as pathogenic and in 9 cases (60%) appeared to be inherited from an unaffected parent. In a total of 40 patients (26,66%) was possible to detect a pathogenic CNVs .Recent studies suggest that when aCGH is performed with an apparently normal karyotype, the diagnostic yield increases by an additional 8 17%. In our study we have obtained a 26,66% of children with pathogenic CNVs that is higher than the results obtained by other authors.

The ciliary gene AHI1 has been found mutated in 7 to 16% of cases with JBTS. On the other hand, of the 39 genes associated with autism, 29 (74%) encode ciliary genes. This association of ciliary genes with autism is highly significant (P < 0.001; two sided Fischer exact test). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ciliary genes may be involved in autism, by performing a candidate gene association study with a cohort of 84 patients with autism vs. 145 healthy controls for the 10 known JBTS genes (AHI1, NPHP1, CEP290, ARL13B, RPGRIP1L, MKS3, CC2D2A, OFD1, TMEM216, and INPP5E). For AHI1 we found nominal association with odds ratioÃ¢ÂÂs from 3.077 to 9.174 and p values for association < 0.0001 for SNPs rs12179084, rs2327587 and rs7766656. Our data suggest that dysfunction of primary cilia may constitute an important neuropathological pathway in autism.",2011,,,"Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ciliary genes may be involved in autism, by performing a candidate gene association study with a cohort of 84 patients with autism vs. 145 healthy controls for the 10 known JBTS genes (AHI1, NPHP1, CEP290, ARL13B, RPGRIP1L, MKS3, CC2D2A, OFD1, TMEM216, and INPP5E).",patient with autism,,patient,

Recently, clinical reas sessment highlighted the high prevalence of gastrointestinal(GI) defects in ASD. Transient suppression of chd8 in zebra ï¬sh led to a reduced number of enteric neurons and a decreased gut mobility which likely drive the GI problems(Bernier et al. Cell, 2014). Materials and Methods: To understand how the loss of chd8 causes the loss of mature enteric neurons, we generated and characterized a stable mutant zebra ï¬sh line: Tg(chd8 sa19827;phox2bb:GFP ) in which the neuronal pro genitors (i.e. enteric neural crest cells, eNCCs) are labeledwith GFP. Results: First, we observed a migration delay and reduced proliferation of eNCCs during early developmentand a decreased number of mature neurons and more speciï¬cally serotonergic neurons at 5 days post fertilization. Second, transcriptomic analyses of eNCCs revealed theupregulation of the serotonin receptor htr6 and the dysregulation of several actors of the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity and RhoA pathways, extracellular matrix compo nents, and several genes from the human morbid genome. Third, behavioral analyses showed i) hyperactivity of the mutant chd8 larvae and ii) normal sociability and no aggressive behavior in the adult mutants.

Despite of significant advances in bioinformatics and genomics, analyses of generalized data on copy number variation (CNV) or variome aimed at gene hunting still represent a major challenge. Here, we have used an approach towards identifying genes implicated in autism pathogenesis through eva luation of autistic variome addressed by microarray genome analysis with an original bioinformatic technology. To identify the spectrum of CNV, a high resolution SNP array genome scan (Affymetrix platform) was used. Bioinfor matics analysis has represented a complex evaluation of CNV by simulations of transcriptional, interactomic and metabolomic activity of candidate genes using available genome, transcriptome and proteome databases (Iourov et al., 2014). Pathogenic CNV were found in 38 children with autism from the Russian cohort (n,212). Six chromosomal rearrangements were detected: deletions at 6p11.2 (PRISM2), 9q21.13 (GDA, ZFAND5, TMC1), 8p23.3p23.1 (46 genes), Xp22.12 (RPS6KA3, CNKSR2) and Yq11.223q11.23 duplications. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of CNV and single gene deletions/du plications has defined following autism candidate genes: CBARA1, KRT83, RBFOX1, NDP , ATP6V1E1, CNKSR2, ATP1A2, FBXO21, ACSL3, ATP2B3, IM PA1, CNTNAP4. The latter allowed speculations on potential autistic mole cular pathways involving genome instability, programmed cell death and axon guidance. Successful delineation of a panel of candidate genes suggests generalized variome analyses as a valuable source for gene hunting. These data supports the idea that additional bioinformatic technologies are able to give further insights into disease pathogenesis. Thus, a disease variome determined by SNP array genome scan and addressed an original bioinfor matic technology appears to be an issue for genomic studies.

Numerous studies indicate that chromosomal and genomic imbalances play a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism. However, the incidence and role of genomic imbalances in the autistic brain the prime target of the disease have not been addressed. Here, we report on the first evaluation of mosaic aneuplody in the autistic brain. Postmortem brain tissue samples (cerebral cortex and cerebellum) of 12 autistic patients and 12 age /sex matched controls were provided by the Brain and Tissue Bank for Develop mental disorder, University of Maryland. In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. autism currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy. Our findings support the hypothesis that somatic genome instability could affect as homeostasis of aneuploid neurons as functioning of the neu ronal network in the whole autistic brain, playing, therefore, an important role in the pathogenesis.

The number in Bulgaria is currently unknown. But the hospitalizationof patients with speech, hearing and communication problems has increased in the past 10 years. Our experience in clinical genetics proved that childhood autism is a heterogeneous syndrome. The aim of our work was to analyze children with autism for mitochondrial DNA mutations and discuss the possibility of their treatment. We made clinical and laboratory investigations and sequenced mt DNA regions in peripheral blood by the PCR SBT method in 4 of our patients with autism. We found different mt DNA mutations and polymorphisms. In a girl suspected for Rett syndrome we found G6852A in mt CO1,which changed Gly>Ser.

Our aim was to analyze, by CGH arrays, a series of patients affected by several neurological disease and/or malformations to try to determine the etiology of the disease in these patients. Methods: A total of 66 pediatric index patients with normal karyotype were analyzed for Copy Number Variations by CGH arrays using CGXÃ¢ÂÂ¢ 8 plex (Agilent Technologies). Proband patients were clinically classified as: au tism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n,30), intellectual disability (n,17), mal formation syndrome (n,9), psychomotor delay (n,8), hypotonia (n,1) and early puberty (n,1).Results: 10 pathogenic (or probably pathogenic) variants and 21 variants of unknown significance were detected. Pathogenic or probably pathogenic variants were identified in 3 patients with psychomotor delay (and other features), 3 patients with intellectual disability, 3 patients with ASD and in one patient with hypotonia and malformations. 6 of the 10 variants were previously described and associated to known syndrome (Prader Willi syndrome (n,1), 1q21.1 microdeletion syndrome (n,1), 16p11.2 microde letion syndrome (n,1), 22q11 deletion syndrome (n,2), and a tetrasomy of 15q11.2 region (n,1)).Discussion and conclusions: Array CGH is a rapid and cost effective techni que for postnatal screening of unknown syndrome, intellectual disability and autism sprectrum disorder.

Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60 and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense PUF60 mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60 and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome. We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four nucleotides in PUF60 (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p. I136Tfs*31). The patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60 which may be of key importance for the syndrome. The case illustrates the strength of exome sequencing in deciphering the genetic basis of disease.

The worldwide prevalence of autism is increasing. However, autism prevalence is low (0.27%) in Brazil due to misdiagnosis of the disorder. Material and Methods: We report on 16 probands with ASD referred by the public health system of GoiÃ¡s. ASD assessment using autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI R), G band karyotyping, and PCR of FMR1 using Amplidex Â®kit were carried out for all patients. Chromoso mal Microarray Analysis (CMA) using GeneChipÂ®CytoScanHDTMarray was done for patients who had normal results in karyotype and PCR. Results: The behavioral phenotypes for all participants were classi ï¬ed in the ASD according to ADI R results whose karyotypes showed neither visible numerical nor structural chromosomal aberrations. FMR1 analysis revealed two children affected by Fragile X syndrome. CMA showed a total of 21 CNVs identi ï¬ed in 12/14 (86%) patients. A total of 13/21 pathogenic CNVs were observedin 8 patients, all located at genetic ASD hotspots, including 22q11.23, Xp22.33 (2/13), 16p11.2 (3/13), harboring no OMIM genes. However, the hotspots at 15q13.3, 15q11.2(2/13), and Xp11.23 (2/13) harbored CHRNA7 ,PWRN2 and ZNF630 genes, respectively, associated with ASD. The remaining CNVs were classi ï¬ed as having unknown clinical signi ï¬cance, distributed at loci: 2q12.2, 3p22.1, 9p21.1 (3/8), Xp22.32, Xq21.1, and Xq24. Two patients showed no alterations in CMA. Conclusions: Identify CNVs and genes using CMA in our patients was very important to understand the hetero geneous spectrum of ASD. The results helped the clinicalmanagement of all patients. A. D. da Cruz: None. I. P. Pinto: None. G. R. Nasci mento: None. M. A. Gigonzac: None. A. S. da Cruz: None. T. C. Vieira: None. D. M.

A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism disor der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa thway. In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study. The study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German). Twenty eight tagSNPs were selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. A significant association, that over came the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and permutations was obtained with the marker rs7052177 (p, 6.13e 4). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible participation of PTCHD1 rare variants in ASD and ID, we are currently performing a mutation screening in the Spanish ASD cohort, and in an additional sample of 200 individuals with ID. The prelimi nary results of this study support the involvement of this gene in autism and cognitive impairments.",2012,,,A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism disor der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al.,patient with autism,,patient,

Three CNVs, a de novo triplication of chromosome 15q11 q12 of paternal origin, a deletion on chromosome 9p24 and a de novo 3q29 deletion, were identified as the cause of the disorder in one patient each. We also identified multiple private or recurrent CNVs, the majority of which were inherited from asymptomatic parents. Finally, an autosomal recessive cause was considered in two pati ents: a homozygous 1p31.1 deletion encompassing PTGER3 was identified in a patient and a rare missense variant in DOCK10 was found in a second patient in association with an inherited deletion that deleted the entire gene. Although highly penetrant CNVs or variants inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion were detected in rare cases, our results mainly support the hypothesis that CNVs contribute to ASDs in association with other CNVs or point variants located elsewhere in the genome.

Certainly or probably causal CNVs, defined Ã¢ÂÂclinical ly relevant CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ, were detected in 17/41 (41%) of ASD probands, corre sponding to 9/19 (47%) multiplex families with at least one affected sibling genetically positive. However only in 3/9 (33%) of these families, siblings share the same causal or highly causal CNV. Additional potentially relevant CNVs not shared by affected sib pairs were detected also in these three fa milies. 45 genes are located on the Ã¢ÂÂclinically relevantÃ¢ÂÂ CNVs. Through an enrichment analysis, we found that 9/45 (20%) of these genes appear pri marily involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation/management. Our results highlight the importance of synaptic and neurite elongation ge nes in the pathogenesis of autism, despite genetic heterogeneity in ASD even within multiplex families belonging to a single ethnic group. Differences in CNV burden may likely contribute to the substantial clinical heterogeneity observed between affected sibs. The genetic and epigenetic mechanisms un derlying genomic instability in these families deserve further scrutiny.",2016,,,"We screened 19 Italian ASD multiplex families (3 triplets and 16 duplets, total N,41 ASD subjects), using array CGH (Agilent 180K).",,Italian ASD multiplex family,,family

Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors. Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ï¬ned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ï¬rst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

The wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical variability in these disorder suggest a complex genetic etiology, which is consistent with the numerous loci thus far identified by linkage, copy number variation and association studies. Although heritability in all three disorder may be as high as ~80%, the genes responsible for much ESHG Concurrent Symposia Abstracts European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org12 www.eshg.orgof this heritability remain to be identified. Based on the observed redu ced reproductive fitness, the relatively uniform world wide incidence, the increased risk of disease with increasing paternal age and the phenotypic complexity of each disease, we, and others, hypothesized that a fraction of this missing heritability may be the result of the occurrence of de novo mu tations affecting any of a large number of genes. In order to test this hypo thesis we first sequenced over 400 synaptic genes in 148 subjects with SCZ, 148 subjects with ASD and 96 subjects with ID. Many likely de novo mutati ons were identified these plus relevant functional studies will be presen ted. Next we sequenced the exomes of SCZ, ASD and ID probands, plus their parents, identifying numerous additional de novo mutations (DNMs). In ad dition, 1/4 of identified DNMs are nonsense mutations, which is more than what is expected by chance. Interestingly, some of the identified genes, such as SHANK3, show deleterious de novo mutations in patients from the three disease cohorts, suggesting close biological overlap in these disorder. Our study supports the notion that DNMs may account for some of the missing heritability SCZ, ASD and ID while providing a list of genes possibly involved in disease pathogenesis.",2012,,,"In order to test this hypo thesis we first sequenced over 400 synaptic genes in 148 subjects with SCZ, 148 subjects with ASD and 96 subjects with ID.",subject with ASD,,subject,

In parallel, we utili zed a Drosophila knockdown model of the POGZ orthologue row to provide further support for the importance of POGZ in cognitive function. Results: We defined common phenotypic features of POGZ patients, inclu ding variable levels of developmental delay and more severe speech and language delay compared to motor delay and coordination issues. We also identified significant associations with vision problems, microcephaly, hy peractivity, a tendency to obesity and feeding difficulties. In addition, we found that downregulation of row expression, specifically in neurons, leads to deficits in habituation, a form of non associative learning that is highly relevant for both ID and ASD.

Epidemiological evidence from family and twin studies supports a strong genetic component in ASD etiology. Oxidative stress and abnormal DNA me thylation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. Brain tissues from ASD cases showed higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers than healthy controls in postmortem analysis. Association between oxidative stress and DNA damage has been well known. Thus, we sought to investiga te a potential link between DNA repair genes and ASD and analyze the role of XPD Asp312Asn and XRCC4 G 1394T gene polymorphisms for ASD in the Turkish population. Material and Methods: Genotyping was conducted by PCR RFLP based on 100 patients and 96 unrelated healthy controls. Results: We, for the first time, demonstrated a positive association between XRCC4 gene variants and ASD risk. Frequencies of XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotypes were higher in patients (%34) than the controls (%18.7). The statistical analysis revealed that the individuals who had XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotype had an increased risk for ASD (OR , 2.23, 95% CI , 1.10 4.55). However, no significant association was found for XPD Asp312Asn polymorphism with the risk of ASD.

Several biological pathways have been high lighted, particularly the excitatory synapse, affected by copy number varia tions (CNV) and enrichment in mutations in genes belonging to the NMDA receptor complex (NRC). We performed a global genetic study of 100 French families including at least 1 individual with autism, who were included in the research project (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).Our project aimed to evaluate both the contribution of CNV in ASD, and secondly the presence of mutations in the NRC complex. For each family, we firstly performed a high resolution pangenomic comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with 1M CGH Agilent Array format to identify rare or de novo CNVs. In parallel, a high throughput targeted sequencing of 216 genes mostly belonging to the NRC complex (179) was carried out with the SureSelect Agilent strategy in order to assess the contribution of gene mutations in our cohort. The first results of our study allowed us to characterize candidates and li kely pathogens genetic alterations in at least 10% of patient. We have found mutations or CNV in genes encoding receptors (NLGN4X, GRM5 ), and in cy tosolic (UPF3B), nuclear (MACROD2), and synaptic (NXPH3) proteins. They also emphasized that the NRC is targeted both by mutations and CNV, inhe rited or de novo. These results underscore the fundamental role of this multiprotein network in the process of neuronal communication and learning and its pathophysio logical impact in autism.",2014,,,"We performed a global genetic study of 100 French families including at least 1 individual with autism, who were included in the research project (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01770548).Our project aimed to evaluate both the contribution of CNV in ASD, and secondly the presence of mutations in the NRC complex.",individual with autism,,individual,

This paper will focus on classic autism and autism, intending to review the current understanding of the etiologies and the multiple pathogenetic pathways that are likely to lead to the autistic phenotype. Like mental retardation, autism is likely to be caused by many different genetic mechanisms and genes rather than a single, or few, major genes or environmental effects. Applying routine genetic testing in clinical (CLIA certified) diagnostic laboratories itÃ¢ÂÂs possible to identify the specific etiology and recurrence risk in 10% to 15% of autism cases and is clinically indicated for any child with autism. In this study we report 5 cases with different genetic syndrome in which ASD has been described as one of the possible manifestations: Down syndrome, 22q13 deletion, ,,cri du chatÃ¢ÂÂ syndrome 5p15 deletion, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Sotos syndrome. c onclusions : The etiologies of ASD are complex and presence of a wide variety cytogenetic abnormalities are providing us with extremely valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism and collaboration with psychiatrists.

Lattanzi","University of Huelva, Huelva, Spain, University College London, London, United  Kingdom, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy","Both autism and schizophrenia (SZ) are highly prevalent cognitive disorder, entailing language deficits. Recent advances in genome wide technologies have provided with a long list of candidate genes for SZ and ASD, but the gap between genes, the pathophysiology of SZ and ASD, and their distinctive cognitive and linguistic profiles still remains open. Our study aims to bridge this gap through an evo devo approach that focuses on how language evolved in the species and that construes both con ditions as poles of a continuum of modes of cognition, also encompassing typically developing cognition. To this aim, we have performed literature mining and network analysis of known candidate genes for SZ and ASD and found that they are overrepresented among the gene believed to be impor tant for the evolution of the human faculty of language. Many of these genes are common risk factors for both conditions. Additionally, we performed in silico data mining of previously published SZ and ASD microarray data sets and found that many of these genes important for language evolution (like CNTNAP2, DLX5, FOXP1, or ROBO2) are differentially expressed in the brains of schizophrenics and autists. We will conclude that the (substanti ally opposite) linguistic (dys)abilities seen in SZ and ASD patients may re present abnormal (but still related) ontogenetic itineraries for the human faculty of language and that the same factors that prompted the transition from an ape like cognition to a human specific cognition may explain the high prevalence of SZ and ASD, but also their related cognitive profiles.

To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region. Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification.

We report the case of a large 4 generation family with suggestive X linked inheritance of ID (XLID), in which 20 members are affected, with moderate to severe ID and mild dysmorphic features in males, and behavioral phenotype in females. Standard cytogenetic and molecular investigations did not provide a diagno sis. A young patient of this family was included in a strategy of targeted high throughput sequencing of 220 ID genes. It led to the identification of a novel missense mutation (c.6437C>G; p. Thr2146Arg) affecting a highly conserved residue in the HUWE1 gene. We then showed its co segregation with ID in 3 affected males and 3 obligate carrier females while it was absent in 3 un affected males. Analysis of available DNA for others family members is on going. This missense predicted to be damaging (SIFT , Polyphen2), is absent from 10,563 chromosomes in the EVS database. Overlapping duplications including HUWE1 have been found to segregate with ID in 12 families (Froy en et al.2012). Three missense mutations were also shown to segregate with ID in 3 families with probable or possible XLID, while a de novo missense was recently observed in a boy with autism but not in his more mildly affected brother. It is therefore probable that the p. Thr2146Arg missense is causative of ID in this large family. A functional test of HUWE1 activity on DNA repair is currently performed on patientâs cells to confirm its pathogenicity. Y. Alembik: None. J. Lauer Zillhardt: None. B. Gerard: None. C.

Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of both sequence and structural rare variations in ASD susceptibility. In particular, focusing on rare copy number variants (CNVs) has already been highly productive in uncovering an increasing num ber of specific genes and chromosomal intervals conferring risk to ASD. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach on 9 multiplex ASD families from Sardinia, we identified a rare genic deletion of ~37 Kb, transmitted from the unaffected mother to both affected siblings. This deletion includes the entire CAPG gene and the last coding exons of ELMOD3 . CAPG encodes a member of the gelsolin/villin family of actin re gulatory proteins, that might be involved in control of dendritic spine shape. ELMOD3 belongs to the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, with recently proposed functional links to sound perception and actin cytoske leton. No deletions involving this genomic region were found in 4768 controls from published high resolution SNP array data, while other two deletions encompassing CAPG and ELMOD3 have been reported in two subjects with ASD, suggesting that CAPG and/or ELMOD3 haploinsufficiency may have clinical relevance to ASD. In order to test this hypothesis together with a recessive model of inheritance, we first excluded that this deletion is a com mon polymorphism in Sardinia, then we performed expression and muta tion analysis of both genes in the discovery pedigree, and a further clinical evaluation of all family members.

Many rare Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that harbor small genomic deletions and insertions have been described in the autism. To identify these likely functional elements, we combined three previously published large cohorts of autistic patients with a large number of controls to analyze over 25K unrelated individuals. After stringent quality control measures, we compared 3K cases to over 19K ethnically matched controls in a two stage genome wide association design. In all, we uncovered 275 statistically significant distinct copy number variable regions. The 60 genes nearest these robust CNVRs are most enriched in gene networks impacting neurological disease, behavior and developmental disorder. A more focused analysis of a subset of 87 CNVRs that are predicted to disrupt 26 genes highlights GABA receptor signaling, and methionine/glutathione trans sulfuration as the most significant canonical pathways disrupted in ASD. Furthermore, we used available family members to characterize CNVRs into inherited vs de novo and used ethnicity information to characterize their effects in different ethnic populations. Taken together, the CNVRs we have identified impact multiple novel genes and signaling pathways, including genes involved in GABA receptor signaling, that may be important for new personalized therapeutic development.",2011,,,"To identify these likely functional elements, we combined three previously published large cohorts of autistic patients with a large number of controls to analyze over 25K unrelated individuals.",,autistic patient,,patient

Be sides intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphisms, WBS patients display hypersociality and comparatively well preserved language skills while 7dup ASD is associated with impairments of varying severity across the autism. The striking symmetry in genotype and phenotype between the two conditions points to the 7q11.23 cluster as a surprisingly small subset of dosage sensitive genes affecting social behavior and cogniti on. The molecular phenotypes of these syndrome in disease relevant cell types remain to be elucidated however, due to scarce availability of primary diseased tissues. Convergent evidence both from human studies and mouse models, points to transcriptional dysregulation as a critical aspect of both conditions, consistent with the presence of several transcription factors in the 7q11.23 interval. Here we present the first analysis of transcriptional dysregulation in human physiopathologically relevant cell types carrying 7q11.23 dosage imbalan ces. We selected a large and unique panel of WBS and 7dup ASD patients and derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the most advanced reprogramming technology based on synthetic mRNAs. These were then differentiated into relevant lineages to establish experimentally tractable models of these conditions. Next, we integrated high throughput sequen cing for transcriptional and chromatin analysis and present here a functio nal dissection of these symmetric conditions that uncovers the principles of dosage dependent transcriptional dysregulation in disease relevant human cells types.",2014,,,We selected a large and unique panel of WBS and 7dup ASD patients and derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the most advanced reprogramming technology based on synthetic mRNAs.,,ASD patient,,patient

Anastasiadou, P . C. Patsalis","The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus","X Linked Intellectual Disability is a heterogeneous disorder with a variable phenotypic spectrum. Currently over 90 XLID genes have been found to be implicated in XLID. The host cell factor C1 (HCFC1) gene is located on chro mosome Xq28 and is a member of the host cell factor family. A mutation in HCFC1 has been previously found to be associated with XLID in a non syndromic XLID family namely MRX3. Currently very few studies exist that further confirm HCFC1 as an XLID gene. We present an XLID family with two affected sons having mild intellectual disability epilepsy and no congenital abnormalities. Fragile X analysis and array CGH using a chromosome X exon specific array were performed and revealed normal results. Subsequently, next generation whole exome se quencing analysis for both brothers was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 following Agilent SureSelect sample preparation (20x coverage). Reads were aligned using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner and the Genome Analysis Tool Kit. Autosome variants and variants present in dbSNP 135 were filtered out. Analysis of rare X chromosome variants present in both brothers revealed a non synonymous mutation in exon 4 of HCFC1 (p. Ala897Val). This mutation is located within GABP2 and ZBTB17 binding domains. Previous screening studies of patients have reported variants within the GABP2 binding domain p. Gly876Ser in an individual with autism (Piton et al., 2011) and p. Ala864Thr in a patient with mental retardation (Tarpey et al., 2010). The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in both patients and their mother.

The gene is maternally imprinted in central nervous system and different studies show that loss of expressed copy causes Angelman Sydrome (ASD)  while the duplication of 15q11q13 represents the genetic cause in 1 3% of autistic patients (dup15 autism). Using 2 cohorts of ASD  and dup15 autism patients, we applied induced Pluripotent Stem cells (iPSCs) technology and neuronal differentiation to identify molecular targets of a dys regulated dosage of UBE3A. To generate iPSCs we used 4 canonical factors identified by Yamanaka (c Myc, Klf 4, Oct3/4 e Sox2) through retroviral or lentiviral vectors. We performed 14 attempts and in 13 we generated cells that we defined as Ã¢ÂÂpartially reprogrammedÃ¢ÂÂ because they lost their typical fibro blasts morphology, but died after passaging. In the last experiment we used a commercial lentiviral vector with the same 4 pluripotency factors making a dup15 hiPSCs cell line positive to pluripotent expression markers; further characterizations are still ongoing.

Clinical features include developmental regression at the age of 6 18 months, ac quired microcephaly, autistic behavior, loss or severe impairment of speech and purposeful hand use, stereotypic hand movements, gait apraxia, and seizures. CDKL5 mutations have been identified in early onset seizure vari ant and FOXG1 mutations in congenital variant of Rett syndrome. We report the results of mutation analysis of these genes in Czech patients with Rett syndrome and mental retardation with Rett like features. Materials and methods: MECP2 was analyzed in 416 patients, CDKL5 was analyzed in 59 patients, and FOXG1 was analyzed in 20 patients. MECP2 and CDKL5 were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis and DNA sequencing. FOXG1 was analyzed by DNA sequencing. Large deletions and duplications were analyzed by MLPA analysis (MRC Holland). Results: Pathogenic mutations in the MECP2 gene in were identified in 45 patients with classic Rett syn drome, 7 patients with atypical Rett syndrome, 11 patients with Rett like features, and 1 patient with autism. CDKL5 mutations were found in 2 pati ents with early onset seizures and Rett like phenotype. No FOXG1 mutation was detected in this study. Conclusions: MECP2 mutations are common in classic Rett syndrome patients, but they are less frequent in atypical or Rett like phenotypes. However, analysis of MECP2 in these patients should not be discouraged. More patients should be examined to determine frequencies of CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations in Czech Republic.

The platform of choice to detect genome wide CNVs has traditionally been microarray (including SNP arrays that can also detect copy neutral LOH regions); however, since samp les have often undergone sequencing to discover pathogenic sequence vari ants, it is desirable to exploit these data to also detect CNVs. Various methods have been proposed to detect CNVs from NGS data, but little information is available which compare the success of these approaches to orthogonal me thods. Using a large data set of constitutional samples from an autism cohort that have been subjected to both whole exome sequencing (WES) and to a genome wide SNP microarray, we compare the ability to detect CNVs bet ween these platforms.

Recently, a role of potassium inward rectifying channels in the pathogenesis of autism has been postu lated due to the identification in patients affected by autism and epilepsy of two mutations in the KCNJ10 gene. The gene encodes the Kir4.1 channel which is expressed in astrocytes and neurons. We then searched for mutati on in the KNCJ10 gene, as well as in two genes (KCNJ2 and KCNJ16) coding for additional Kir channels with reported expression in astrocytes and neu rons, in two unrelated patients. We detected a new mutation in the KCNJ2 gene in a boy affected by autism. The mutation has been detected also in the healthy father and in the paternal grandmother who reported a case of SIDS (Sudden Infant death syndrome) in her family.

Intellectual disability (ID) is the core disorder of this syndrome but autistic features such as stereotypic movements and lack of social com munications are commonly reported. To further assess the role of MEF2C in autism, we looked for MEF2C point mutations by Sanger sequencing and for MEF2C copy number variations by SNP array in a cohort of 195 patients with ASD and mild to severe ID. We identified a de novo frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon in 2 siblings with ASD and severe ID. A maternal germinal mosaicism was confirmed based on the haplotype. A de novo MEF2C deletion was also found in a patient with ASD and a mild ID. In this study, we observed MEF2C haploinsufficiency in 1,5% (95% confidence interval: 0 3.2%) of patients with ASD. This is the first study to look specifically at MEF2C in ASD. Of note, a mutation in MEF2C was also found once by whole exome sequencing in another cohort of 175 trios with ASD. According to this notable MEF2C ha ploinsufficiency frequency in ASD, we strongly recommend to pay specific attention to this gene when performing non targeted genetic screening in ASD with a comorbid ID even for patients without severe ID.",2014,,,"Of note, a mutation in MEF2C was also found once by whole exome sequencing in another cohort of 175 trios with ASD.",trio with ASD,,trio,

SHANK3 haploinsufficiency implicated in Phelan McDermid 22q13 microdeletion is one of the more prevalent monogenic causes of ASD, ex plaining at least 0,5% of cases, but the indication of SHANK3 sequencing in patients with ASD and ID remain difficult. Here we report on two patients with de novo SHANK3 mutations identified by next generation sequencing (NGS). Patient 1, aged 15, was part of a cohort of 40 patients screened by exome sequencing for undiagnosed severe ID, and a truncating mutation was identified in SHANK3 (c.4381C>T ; p. Gln1461*). Patient 2, aged 10, was part of a cohort of 106 patients with ID screened by targeted NGS of 220 ID genes, and a causative heterozygous truncating mutation of SHANK3 was identified (c.2955_2970dup;p. Pro992Argfs*325). They both had normal measurements, severe ID, developmental and speech delay with acquisition of a few words and secondary regression with absence of speech, attention deficit and behavioral disorder necessitating treatment, autistic traits, in somnia and tantrum. Patient 1 had eating and digestive difficulties, patient 2 had distal spasticity, epilepsy from age 5, and facial dysmorphic features. These two clinical presentations appear nonspecific within the ASD ID spectrum.

The disease is genetically heterogeneous and associated with mutations in type IV collagen that forms a distinct network in the glomerular basement mem brane (GBM). Fifteen percent of patients with ASD  have autosomal recessive inheritance caused by pathogenic mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes, located in 2q36 37.Subjects and methodsGenetic analysis was performed on a 28 year old male patient who had, since the age of 3 years old, presented nephrotic syndrome and persistent microhematuria. He fulfilled four of the ASD  clinical diagnostic criteria: a po sitive family history of hematuria, proteinuria, hearing loss, and typical elec tron microscopy abnormalities of the GBM. The entire coding sequence and flanking intronic regions of the COL4A3/A4 genes were analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing reaction. Afterwards, sixteen members of his family (8 males and 8 females) were included in the analysis. ResultsA novel heterozygous mutation (c. [998G>A]+[,]; p.[G333E]+[,]) in exon 18 of the COL4A3 gene was found in the proband and it was confirmed in ele ven members of the family. ConclusionAmong relatives of members who carried the novel mutation, the clinical phenotype of ASD  was variable. All of them presented hematuria, and 6 of 12 also had proteinuria and hearing loss. The identification of new mutations and their correlation with clinical phenotype are important to offer an early treatment and genetic counselling.",2015,,,"Fifteen percent of patients with ASD  have autosomal recessive inheritance caused by pathogenic mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes, located in 2q36 37.Subjects and methodsGenetic analysis was performed on a 28 year old male patient who had, since the age of 3 years old, presented nephrotic syndrome and persistent microhematuria.",patient with ASD,,patient,

Lace2","1Childrenâ s University Hospital, Riga, Latvia,  2Latvian Biomedical Research and Study  Centre, Riga, Latvia, 3Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia","Background: autism are among the most common children neurodevelopment disorder. ASD patients often have co morbid conditions, such us obsessive compulsive, sleep disorder, self destructive behavior, increased irritability, aggression and self injury. One third of ASD patients take an antipsychotic medication. One of the most popular second generation antipsychotic is risperidone. Two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, are involved in metabolization of psy chotropic medications.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c disease, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaselike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

Also it is reported that FXS is the most common single gene cause of autism, responsible for 2% to 6% of all cases of autism. We studied 41 patients with non syndromic autism in Western Saudi Arabia, we determined the trinucleotide repeat number (TRN) of CGG in 5Ã¢ÂÂ end for the untranslated region of the gene FMR1 using PCR technique as described by Chong et al, (AJMG 51:522 526, 1994).After performing gel electrophoresis for the PCR products using 2% agarose gel, the results analysis demonstrated that all samples have a CGG trinucleotide repeat number less than 50 repeats. In conclusion even though our sample number is small, with the percentage reported FMR1 gene mutation seems to not play a major role in the etiology of autism in Western Saudi Arabia.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ï¬ndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey.

Chromoso mal microarray analysis (CMA), with a 10 20% diagnostic yield, can iden tify CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ¤1 Mb. We report our experience with the use of the Affymetrix SNP Arrays in 1600 Italian patients during the past 6 years (2008 2013). We identified CNVs with a high score of pathogenicity in 415 (27%) pati ents. Among them 143 (34.4%) showed a CNV overlapping with a known syndrome, 272 (65.6%) a likely pathogenic rearrangement. Of particular interest, we found some CNVs useful to further delineate the clinical fea tures associated with deletions in 8q12.1q12.3, in 15q25.2, in 17q21.31, in 2q24.1q24.2, in 22q11.2, and duplications in 16p13.3 and in 11p13. Some CNVs were useful to describe new syndrome such as a 1.7 Mb deletion in 3q13.2q13.31. Also, we have identified a large group of small CNVs (< 1.0 Mb) encompassing, either in whole or in part, functionally related genes to the phenotypes such as CASK, CNTN6, SNTG2, HIP1, DLG2, NRXN1, MCPH1 and CHL1 genes. Among these small CNVs, we have reported a FOXP1 gene microdeletion in a boy with autism and speech delay, and a de novo intersti tial deletion of 0.122 Mb at 2q24.2 region harboring only TBR1 gene in a boy with moderate to severe intellectual disability.

Sacco1, A. M. Persico1,2","1Unit of Child and Adolescent NeuroPsychiatry & Laboratory of Molecular Psychiatry  and Neurogenetics, University Ã¢ÂÂCampus Bio MedicoÃ¢ÂÂ, Rome, Italy, 2Mafalda Luce Center  for Pervasive Developmental Disorders, Milan, Italy","Converging evidence suggests that abnormal immunity is involved in the pathophysiology of autism both in children and adults. Altered immune processes include ongoing neuroinflammation in post mortem brains, elevated pro inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, altered immune cell function, presence of brain specific auto antibodies, and dysregulated immune transcriptome. One strategy to assess whether dysimmunity contributes to ASD pathogenesis or represents a collateral by standing effect is to investigate whether functional SNPs known to influence immune gene expression or function are associated with ASD. We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in all major immune pathways. Statistically significant opposite transmission patterns between ASD and unaffected siblings were evident for rs2243250 (IL4 ) and rs231775 (CTLA4), with the combination of high IL4 expression and low CTLA4 function alleles associated with autism and the opposite alleles overtransmitted to unaffected siblings. Similarly, at rs361525 and rs2430561 , functional SNPs located in the TNFA and IFNG genes, the combi nation of high expression alleles was associated with autism, while the op posite alleles were protective. These results indicate that common variants conferring hyper responsive Th2 (IL4 and CTLA4) and NK (TNFA and IFNG) activation also confer autism vulnerability. Hence previously reported in creases in plasma Th2 cytokine levels and NK cell activation are not mere by standing effects, but are instead part of the pathophysiological cascade resulting in autism in a sizable subgroup of patients.",2014,,,We genotyped 484 simplex and 18 multiplex families with an ASD pro band at 34 known functional SNPs located in 26 immune genes involved in all major immune pathways.,,ASD proband,,proband

Furthermore, we demon strate distinct genotype phenotype correlations. Severe encephalopathic phenotypes are significantly more often caused by truncating mutations in GRIN2A , whereas missense mutations are by far more common in benign Rolandic epilepsy patients. For GRIN2B , the majority of ASD individuals pre sent with truncating mutations, whereas all epilepsy cases appear to have gain of function mutations.

Recent high resolution microarray based studies in autism have identified a number of novel submicroscopic copy number variants (CNVs) including both deletions and duplications.

Deletions and duplications at chromosome 16p11.2 appear to be associated with ~1% of unexplained, idiopathic and nonsyndromic autism. Several of the genes that reside within the 16p11.2 microdeletion represent promising candidates for autism based on known expression and functional data. Submicroscopic duplication of Xp22.31 has been reported as either a possible cause of intellectual disability and/or autistic behavior or a benign variant. .

Subsequently, genes involved in synaptic signaling have been investigated with a priority forcandidategene studies. A synaptosomal associated protein 25(SNAP25) gene plays a crucial role in the central ner voussystem, contributing to exocytosis by targeting andfusion ofvesicles to the cell membrane.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ï¬rst benchmarked our bioinfor matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conï¬rmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ï¬rst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B. B.

Campbell","University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States","From genome wide association studies (GWASD) , a novel gene was discove red that has a highly significant association with autism. The gene is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) designated MSNP1ASD  (moesin pseudogene 1, antisense). Expression of MSNP1ASD  was increased in the cerebral cortex of individuals with ASD and individuals with the ASD associated genetic marker. Overexpression of MSNP1ASD  in human neuronal cells caused decreased expression of moesin (MSN) mRNA and moesin pro tein, which is involved in neuronal process stability and immune response. These data indicate one aspect of the potential contribution of increased MSNP1ASD  expression in ASD. However, there are likely to be additional transcriptomic impacts of this lncRNA. To determine the effects of altered MSNP1ASD  expression on the neuronal transcriptome, we transfected human neuronal progenitor cells with constructs that overexpressed MSNP1ASD  or transcriptionally silenced MSNP1ASD.  RNA Seq analysis indicated altered expression of multiple genes that contribute to altered neuronal process stability and immune response, including MSN. However, our data indica te several genes that are impacted by MSNP1ASD  dysregulation more signi ficantly than MSN, suggesting a network of genes that contribute to ASD risk. Ongoing experiments seek to define the role of the MSNP1ASD  gene network in neuronal process stability.",2015,,,Expression of MSNP1ASD  was increased in the cerebral cortex of individuals with ASD and individuals with the ASD associated genetic marker.,individual with ASD,,individual,

U.Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 3Department of Parenting and Special Education, K. U.Leuven, K. U.Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. Background: The genetic causes of autism (ASDs) are heterogeneous and still unknown in the majority of cases. Structural copy number variants (CNVs) were found in sufficiently high frequency to suggest that cytogenetic and microarray analyses are considered in routine clinical workup. An inte resting paradigm for clinical practice is that each rare CNV may account for only a small proportion of variance in ASD at the population level but may have a large effect in a few families in which it segregates. Material and methods: CNV association studies are performed in a family based cohort. The sample contains 161 families ascertained through one or more autistic probands with normal intelligence or mild intellectual disability. The study cohort contains 648 individuals: 227 probands, 324 parents, 97 unaffected siblings belonging to 161 families. All probands, unaffected siblings and parents are genotyped with high resolution Illumina OMNI 2.5 8v1 microarrays. For all individuals, an extensive list of phenotypic information is collected inclu ding IQ, SRS scores, 3DI, clinical genetic examination and family history. Results:We present the results of a family based study on the validity of CNV de tection in ASD using a high resolution platform. We study the segregation of known and novel rare CNVs with qualitative and quantitative autism phenotypes.

While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis.

Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis order 1 were identified.

Both brothers had inherited an identical 134 Kb duplication of the regulatory genomic region 0.5 Mb upstream of SOX9 from their mother. In another brother who had inherited the same ma ternal SOX9 haplotype, no upstream duplication was found, proving that the mother was a gonadal mosaic for the duplication. We hypoth esize that the duplication caused sufficient SRY independent SOX9 expression in the undifferentiated fetal gonads to promote testicular development. Apparently, this effect was tissue and/or fetal specific as no SOX9 expression was detectable in leukocytes and skin fibroblasts from any of the siblings. The observations in the family also suggest that such a SOX9 regulatory region duplication may predispose for autism in the presence of a Y chromosome, i.e. a SRY gene. This hy pothesis is supported by the SOX9 segregation pattern which as a less than 8,2 % probability of being a random event, and the unexplained general excess of autistic features in males. We therefore propose that an additional role of SOX9, directly linked to testicular differentiation, could be the promotion of male specific brain development. Molecular basis of Mendelian disorder ",2010,,,"In a sibship of six a 46,XX male hermaphrodite with ovotestes and no detectable SRY sequence had a brother with infantile autism without mental retardation.",brother with infantile autism,,brother,

Pojskic","Institute for genetic engineering and biotechnology,","Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: autism, or autism is neurological and developmental disorder that begins earlyin childhood and lasts throughout a person's life, character ized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and non verbal communication. Large genome rearrangements are being identi ï¬ed in ASD as an under lying cause for development of this syndrome. These rearrangements are mostly deletions, but duplications canbe found. We present case of twin boys with APBA2 gene duplication. Materials and Methods: Twin boys, age 9 were referred to genetic counseling and testing with diagnosed ASD (DSM IV). DNA was isolated from buccal swabs of the boys, and 3 ml of whole blood from parents. Parents pro vided completed questionnaires for tick disorder in chil dren as well as Coordination disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ). Identi ï¬cation of mutations was made with MLPA (multiplex ligase dependent probe ampli ï¬cation) technique, with MLPA kits P343 and P339 (Mrc Holland). Results: All samples were typed successfully. We iden tiï¬ed de novo APBA2 gene duplication in both twins. This gene, located on 15q13.1 locus is already associated with autism features. DCDQ scores are similar in twins withindication of DCD. Assessment of the Questionnaires for tick disorder in children revealed that one sibling is com pletely absent for ticks while other has high score for sec tion related to vocal and involuntary ticks. Conclusions: This ï¬nding require further investigation and follow up on spatial and temporal differences in autismassociated traits in APBA2 gene duplication associated autism. N.

Couto","LASIGE, Lisbon, Portugal","Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of autism Spec trum disorder (ASD) has hindered the establishment of genotype phenotype associations. Herein, we presented a novel approach that integrates semantic similarity andunsupervised machine learning methods to dissect the ASD genotypic heterogeneity and to identify phenotypic mani festations of ASD genetic variants. This approach wasapplied to copy number variants (N ,6650), disrupting 3998 genes from 1119 ASD patients. Functional similarities among genes were computed using Resnik semanticsimilarity measure. Semantic similarity score, ranging from 0 to 1 represents the functional similarity between two genes, where 1 represents identical genes while score 0reï¬ects functionally dissimilar genes. Agglomerative hier archical clustering of the computed gene similarity matrix identi ï¬ed four different clusters of functionally related genes. Silhouette analysis indicated that clusters were compact and consistent (average Silhouette value ,0.31). The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD. Cluster 1 genes were also most signiï¬cantly enriched for Schizophrenia Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term, which is a co occurring condition with ASD. The other three clusters were not enriched for ASD related HPO terms. The results indicated thatphenotypic genotypic associations can established for ASD by reducing its genotypic heterogeneity i.e. clustering of functionally similar genes. However, to associate theseclusters with phenotype, further efforts are required to enrich HPO resource. (Grant reference: PTDC/CCI BIO/ 28685/2017) A. C.G. IlhÃ©u: None. M. Asif: None. F. M.

FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectual disability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano metry. Several Foxp1 targets previously identi ï¬ed by microarray analysis in the brain were signi ï¬cantly deregu lated in the oesophagus of Foxp1 +/ mice. The total gut transit was signi ï¬cantly prolonged. Spatiotemporal maps depicting the colonic contraction patterns revealed strongly disturbed contractility and peristalsis. Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1 dependent deregulation of genes.

The loss of expression of these genes results from various mechanisms: deletion of the critical region, uniparental disomy, imprinting defects or gene mutation . First, we studied 27 patients with PWS and 17 patients with ASD,  previously confirmed by microsatellite, FISH and methylation analysis by a new method, Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MS MLPA). In the PWS group we confirmed all 19 deletions, 5 uniparental maternal heterodisomies, 2 uniparental maternal isodisomies, and one case with an imprinting defect . In the group of 17 ASD  patients we confirmed all 16 deletions and one uniparental paternal isodisomy . Next we studied using MS MLPA 5 additional new patients, 4 PWS and 1 ASD,  and we revealed 2 cases with uniparental maternal disomies, 2 cases with uniparental maternal isodisomies, and 1 case with uniparental paternal isodisomy . We also applied the MS MLPA method to two cases with marker chromosome 15 and an Angelman like phenotype . We detected three alleles, two methylated and one unmethylated, in both cases .

Methylation analysis at the SNRPN locus using Southern Blotting revealed a strong paternal band but a faint maternal band, a pattern more consistent with a mosaic Angelman result than a Prader Willi result. Methylation specific PCR analysis and repeat blot analysis on a second sample confirmed this result thereby excluding technical artefact. FISH analysis using a probe for D15S10 excluded a deletion or duplication of this region. Microsatellite analysis using markers across 15q11 q13 and in distal 15q revealed a pattern consistent with biparental inheritance.

Gregg2","1Spectral Genomics, Inc. , Houston, TX, 2University of California at  Davis, Davis, CA. ","autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by impairment in social interactions and in language and communication skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities. The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic susceptibility to autism and a high incidence in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650 band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome, there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes) can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average, throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially labeled with fluorochromes. After co hybridization of labeled test and reference genomic DNAs, the BAC arrays were scanned and analyzed with software developed specifically for this purpose. Control hybridizations with normal male to male, male to female and female to female reference samples were performed and showed the expected results.

Introduction: autism is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. Sofar, more than one hundred high con ï¬dence susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed and recent efforts have led to an ever growing list of ASD candidate genes. Among these, low voltage activated T type calcium channels (Ca v3) genes ( CACNA1G , CACNA1H ,CACNA1I ) have been consistently implicated, which nicely correlates with the role calcium signaling in neuronal function. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing analysis in a cohort of 105 families, consisting of125 ASD individuals, 210 parents and 57 unaffected siblings, to explore the presence of rare damaging variants in Ca v3 genes. Results: We have identi ï¬ed inherited damaging variants in Ca v3 genes in 21 ASD families. Interestingly, compound heterozygous rare damaging missense variants were detected in the CACNA1H gene in 6 ASD subjects (2 sibs, 2 MZ twins and 2 independentcases), belonging to 4 different families. The identi ï¬ed biallelic damaging variants could affect the CACNA1H protein activity with a recessive model and contribute to the disease development in the context of a high risk genetic background. Thus, we areperforming functional analysis to clarify the role of the CACNA1H variants on the calcium channel activity. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of biallelic mutations in 4 different ASD families provides further support for a role ofCACNA1H in ASD susceptibility, and for the ï¬rst time highlights it as a candidate gene in ASD, acting in a recessive mode of inheritance.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

While most (80%) ASD  cases are X linked, approximately 15% and 5% areautosomal recessive or dif ï¬cult to differentiate from thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) dominant forms. Digenic inheritance among COL4A3 COL4A5 or their concomitance with other glomerulopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD) related genes, has been recently proposed to explain the variable phenotypic expression andincomplete penetrance frequently observed in ASD  patients.1244Materials and Methods: NGS analysis of 55 glomer ulopathy and CKD related genes was performed in a group of 56 unrelated Polish patients with suspected ASD.  Results: In all patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. Overall, 17 known and 32 novel, likely pathogenic alterations in COL4A3 COL4A5 were identi ï¬ed. The inheritance was X linked in 73% of cases, remaining 9% autosomal recessive and 18% were dominant ASD/ TBMN. Changes were randomly distributed across allCOL4A3 COL4A5 coding regions, however we revealed a recurrent COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A in twelve patients. Additionally, four patients with this alteration had likelypathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 , which may modify disease âs severity. Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the gen otypic spectrum of ASD,  which will facilitate future research on the genotype phenotype correlations. Multiple gene sequencing is an effective approach to obtain geneticinformation in ASD,  particularly about the mode of inheri tance which is important for counselling and may help to predict the clinical course, especially for those patients withmild, non speci ï¬c or atypical phenotype.

","autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by major difficulties in social interaction with unusual responses to the environment similar to those in a mild form of autism. 0.3 0.6% of the population will meet the criteria of ASD.  The clinical features includes paucity of empathy, difficulties to form friendships with social isolation as a consequence. The syndrome also includes pedantic and monotonic speech and highly circumscribed interests in topics such as the weather and railway tables or maps. We have identified two non related patients with ASD  both with apparently balanced reciprocal translocations with breakpoints in 17p13. Cytogenetic analysis revealed de novo translocations t(13;17)(q14;p13) and t(17;19)(p13;cen) respectively. Mapping the translocation breakpoints of the chromosomes 17p was performed by FISH. Chromosome 17p13 specific clones were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of the two translocations. The results demonstrated the two breakpoints to be located within a region of 300 kb. The region is spanning 14 known genes. PCR amplified fragments derived from or flanking 5 of the genes was used as FISH probes to perform a closer definition of the breakpoints.",2002,,,We have identified two non related patients with ASD  both with apparently balanced reciprocal translocations with breakpoints in 17p13.,patient with ASD,,patient,

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together.

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together. Conclusion: autistic individuals with higher genetic burden for the disorder, including large rare CNVs andhigher load of PRS, have different bene ï¬ts of SSGT com pared with individuals with lower genetic risk.

Materials and Methods: In the context of an Interna tional project aiming at identifying the genetic causes of ASD (autism Sequencing Consortium, Mount Sinai), weperformed a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis in a cohort of 100 ASD patients, not harboring CNVs, attending the Medical Genetics Unit of Siena. Results: Mutations in already known ASD related genes were detected in 11% of cases, while either de novo or inherited mutations in novel genes were identi ï¬ed in 21% of cases. The novel identi ï¬ed genes can be pooled in three categories: i genes for which causative mutations have not1378been previously reported (eight genes), ii genes for which a likely association with ASD has been previously reported in a single case (eg DRP2 etc) and iii genes whose mutations have been previously associated with intellectual disability (ID) in only one (eg BCORL1 etc) or a few families (eg BRD4 recently associated with a Cornelia De Lange likephenotype etc). Conclusions: Overall, our extensive approach goes beyond safely con ï¬rming the pathogenic role of ASD/ID candidate genes and allows establishing the novel role of ID related genes in ASD. It delineates the impact of new genes across neurodevelopmental dimensions, providingimportant new insights into functional pathways involved in heterogeneous ASD phenotypes. F. Mari: None. C.

Introduction: Alport syndrome (ASD)  is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous nephropathy caused by pathogenic variants inCOL4A3, COL4A4 orCOL4A5 . About 85% of ASD  patients have X linked inheritance, which causes more severe phenotype in males, whereas in females, penetrance depends onX chromosome inactivation pattern. Originating in the MiddleAges COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A p. Gly624Asp is predominant in Central/East Europe and mostly gives mild ASD  symptoms. Materials and Methods: Next generation sequencing analysis of glomerulopathy and chronic kidney disease related genes panelwas performed in Polish patients with suspected ASD.  Results: In 65 patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. The most frequent was X linked ASD  caused by 32different COL4A5 variants (75%). A recurrent COL4A5 variant p. Gly624Asp in 15 patients (nine males and six females) was identi ï¬ed. Additionally, four patients with this substitution had pathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 . The clinical course of patients with this genotype was mostly milder than observed in individuals with other COL4A5 variants. They presented only haematuria with or without proteinuria. Of these, two patients alsohad hearing impairment: male with only p. Gly624Asp variant andfemale with additional variant in COL4A3 . Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the genotypic spectrum of ASD,  which will facilitate future research on thegenotype phenotype correlations. Variant p. Gly624Asp in COL4A5 was predominant and accounted for 31% of X linked ASD  in the study group. Observations of mild phenotype in our patients withthis genotype relate to literature data.

(1) Objectives: We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods: 1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the AK13094 gene, another was near GFOD and RANBP10 . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11 gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11 is expressed in the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses . (2) Interestingly, there is evidence that altered synaptogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism . For instance, the cell adhesion molecules NLGN 3 and 4 are impli cated in autism through their role in the establishment of functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons . (3) Thus, CHD11 represents both a positional and functional candidate gene for autism . Mutation screening in a larger cohort of autism patients is ongoing .

We are conducting a 5 year longitudinal study on the natural history of ASD,  to improve our understanding of the complications, morbidity and neurodevelopment in ASD.  We present the baseline clinical data that describes characteristics of the first 102 subjects enrolled in our study. Methods: All subjects were between 5 months and 26 years old. Sub jects were evaluated by detailed history, physical examination, stan dardized neurodevelopmental assessments, and electroencephalo grams (EEG). Deletions were sized using a chromosome 15 specific comparative genomic hybridization microarray. Results: The median age of the 102 subjects was 36 months (80% were between 17 months and 60 months). 74% of subjects had dele tions, 15% had either imprinting defects or uniparental disomy, and 12% had UBE3A mutations. The most common findings were mouth ing behavior in 93%, short attention span in 91%, microcephaly in 81%, sleep difficulties in 79%, ataxic or broad based gait in 78%, fascination with water in 75%, and inappropriate laughter was observed in 62% of subjects. Clinical seizures were reported in 69% of subjects, although all EEGs were abnormal. Data on the variations in these characteris tics by molecular subtype will be presented. Conclusions: In children with ASD,  it is the neurobehavioral phenotype, rather than the dysmorphic features or seizures, that is most char acteristic. The Ã¢ÂÂclassicÃ¢ÂÂ ASD  phenotype is more frequently observed in those with deletions or UBE3A mutations, and not as evident in those with UPD or imprinting defects.",2009,,,"Conclusions: In children with ASD,  it is the neurobehavioral phenotype, rather than the dysmorphic features or seizures, that is most char acteristic.",child with ASD,,child,

The recurrent 16p11 .2 rearrangements im plicated in autism likely occur via nonallelic homologous recombina tion (NAHR) between directly oriented LCRs . The breakpoints of the 16p11 .2 p12 .1 deletions were mapped to nonhomologous sequences; however, the deletions were proposed to have arisen via NAHR . We present a 17 year old patient with developmental delay, short stature, skeletal anomalies, and a normal G banding karyotype and M FISH . Using metaphase HR CGH, we identified a deletion in 16p11.2 p12.1 and verified it by FISH with BAC clones. Whole genome array CGH with ~385,000 oligonucleotide probes (NimbleGen) defined the dele tion between ~22 .482 .580 29 .342 .610 bp (6 .8 Mb) . Unexpectedly, we identified a second deletion ~600 kb in size, mapping ~750 kb distal to the first one. The breakpoints of both deletions map within nonhomolo gous sequences; breakpoint junction sequencing is in progress . We propose that the deletions arose through recently reported Fork Stall ing and Template Switching (FoSTeS) replication based mechanism (Lee at al . 2007) rather than NAHR .

Introduction: autism are complex and lifelong heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions. Different genetic models could explain ASD, ranging from monogenic disorder or copy number variation to polygenic disease. Mito chondrial DNA (mtDNA) may have a role in the pathogenesis ofASD. Materials and Methods: Our cohort consists of 98 families including 117 subjects with ASD, 193 parents and 59 unaffectedsiblings. We performed deep sequencing of mtDNA, de ï¬ning haplogroups and evaluating private variants, including those at low heteroplasmy. An independent cohort of 127 Italian families was used as a replica. Both these cohorts were compared to a controlgroup of 5088 healthy individuals. MtDNA content was assessed inblood cells. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate risk factors inï¬uencing ASD severity classi ï¬ed by the calibrated severity score of autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Results: Haplogroup H in probands resulted protective for ASD, counterbalanced by increased risk conferred by haplogroups L and I. Paternal haplogroups U5a and K increased the risk ofdeveloping ASD in offspring. Probands showed increased numberof missense mutations in MT ATP6 and MT ATP8 and reduced mtDNA content. Paternal super haplogroups H and JT are associated with mild phenotypes, whereas variants with 15% 5%heteroplasmy are associated with severe phenotypes. Conclusions: Our results indicate a contribution of mtDNA to ASD susceptibility and phenotypic expression. Paternal mtDNA inï¬uences the ASD pathogenesis, possibly due to accumulation of nuclear de novo variants or epigenetic alterations in fathers â germinal cells that are transmitted to the offspring.

Introduction: Pathogenic variants of the myelin transcription factor 1 like ( MYT1L) gene cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder and include missense, premature termination codon (PTC) variants and 2p25.3 microdeletions. Despite a strongenrichment in de novo mutations in developmental disorder or autism trio studies, the clinical characterization and phenotype genotype correlations are scarce and only 21 patients with missense or PTC variants have been reported so far. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genetic information of 37 new patients with (likely) pathogenic MYT1L variants through datasharing resources and collaborations and performed a comprehensive meta analysis with already publisheddata (total ,58 patients). Results: Weï¬rst con ï¬rmed that the main phenotypic features of the MYT1L related disorder are developmental delay (95%), intellectual disability (ID, 68%), overweight or obesity (59%),behavioral disorder (100%) and epilepsy (22%). In addition, 32% of the patients presented learning disorder without ID and 19% presented in infancy feeding dif ï¬culties, which were not reported before. We further describe the inconstant dysmorphic features(69%) and present the weight evolution of 21 patients. We show that patients harboring highly clustered missense variants within the 2 ndand 3rdzinc ï¬nger domains are not clinically distinguish able from patients with truncating variants. We report the ï¬rstde novo missense variants outside the 2nd and 3rd zinc ï¬nger domains, which nevertheless remain the target domains for most pathogenic missense variants. Conclusion: We provide an updated description of clinical and genetic data of the MYT1L associated neurodevelopmental disorder, hence improving diagnosis and clinical management ofthese patients.

375,72,1291,De novo partial duplication of chromosome 7q in a male patient with infantile autism,P1328.,,,autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic componentas shown in family studies. The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line. In order to determine the exact localizationand orientation of the duplication FISH experiments using several YACswere performed. ,2001, S. Beyer   S. M. Klauck  A.

The un derlining molecular deficit is the failure of maternal copy of the imprinted UBE3A gene due to maternal deletions, the most common present in 70 75% of case, which is detected by FISH of the UBE3A region. Only a small number of intragenic or whole genomic microdeletions of UBE3A have been repor ted. We report on two brothers with ASD  with microdeletion of 15q11.2 q12 emcompassing UBE3A gene, close to breakpoint of inversion at 15q11.2 and 15q26.1. The brothers were the first and second children of unrelated and healthy parents. They were born at term after uneventful pregnancy. Patient 1 (older brother) had developmental delay, walked with ataxic gait, and did not speak word at 6 years old. He developed seizure at 4 years old. Patient 2 (younger brother) had also developmental delay and started sitting at 15 months. They had mild phenotype and behavior of ASD.  Karyotype revealed pericentric inversion of 15q and FISH test revealed deletion of UBE3A re gion. Array CGH revealed 467kb deletion at 15q11.2 q12, only emcompas sing UBE3A and a part of SNORD115, and 53kb deletion at 15q26.1. Their mother revealed normal karyoptype and no deletion of 15q11.2 q12 with array CGH, so we assumed germline mosaicism. This report is a rare familial case with ASD  detected by routine FISH test.

Currently, diagnosable medical conditions, cytogenetic abnormalities, environmental factors, and single gene defects associated with autism, together account for 10 20% of cases. We report two children with autistic behavior, mental retardation and dysmorphic features.

Array CGH analysis revealed cryptic ampli fication of 16p11.2 region spanning 1,362 Mb in first patient and an amplification spanning 1,274Mb of 7p12.3 region in second patient. The microdeletion and a reciprocal microduplication of 16p11.2 region carry substantial susceptibility to autism and appear to account for ap proximately 1% of cases. 7p12.3 is a region of shared genetic associa tion between ASD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated One group consisted of 14 patients with autism andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found A 1pter deletion resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR growth retardation and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR epilepsy microcephaly and dysmorphism consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR microcephaly an atrial septum defect and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients.

","Intellectual disability (ID) and autism are over lapping disorder that constitute a major public health problem with a cu mulated frequency of about 2.5%. Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members. Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website. This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare disease affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

Apart from 14 patients with unique aberra tions, 2 patients carried duplications and a 3rd patient a deletion within the 22q11 region, of 0 .726, 2 .966, and 0 .388 Mb, respectively . The duplications were confirmed by multiplex ligation mediated probe am plification and are likely to involve LCRs A, B and D. We conclude that SNP array based screening of ASD patients uncovers an appreciable number of CNVs, which in part overlap with loci already discovered by other approaches. Our finding that 3 out of 56 ASD patients carried aberrations within the 22q11 region is highly unexpected . The rela tively small size of CNVs found in this study may allow us to pinpoint candidate genes for ASD .",2008,,,"Screening 56 patients with autism and additional major or minor anom alies with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) we found in 16 patients 9 regions with deleted and 9 with duplicated signals .",patient with autism,,patient,

Dahl1","1Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, 2Gothenburg University,  Gothenburg, Sweden","There is strong evidence from twin and family studies for the importance of genetic factors in idiopathic autism. The results from independent reports suggest that the disease is caused by the action of several genes, possibly acting epistatically. We have used cDNA microarray technology to clarify the molecular mechanism behind autism. Blood samples were obtained from affected sib pairs co segregating for chromosome 7q31, previously shown to be a candidate region for autism. The RNA was obtained from EBV transformed B lymphocytes as the only RNA source available. mRNA levels for approximately 7,700 genes were assessed by in house produced cDNA microarrays. The microarray data was analysed using dedicated computer software in order to identify significant up or down regulation of specific genes. Several genes with small but significant down regulation were identified in the samples derived from individuals with autism.

These patients were divided into three groups : Group I (23 patients) with Rett syndrome diagnosed in our multidisciplinary consultation. Group II (28 patients) referred by external collaborators for a suspicion of Rett syndrome Group III (17 patients) from our center exhibiting a severe encephalopathy with autistic behaviour. In the first group, 21 mutations were identified ; in the second, 8 mutations and zero in the third group. These results confirm that the vast majority of mutations in the MECP2 gene lead to a classical Rett syndrome phenotype. They also show that a large proportion of girls with a severe mental handicap are not found to be associated with a MECP2 mutation on the contrary to what was recently proposed in the litterature. In addition, we did not find any genotype phenotype correlations for the Rett syndrome patients taking into account the mutation type, the functional domain affected by the mutation and the X chromosome inactivation status of these patients except for the mutation involving the C terminal domain associated with a ÃÂ« forme frustre ÃÂ» of the disease.

SLI affects 3 7% of English speaking pre school children. During a genome wide CNV scan using a multi algorithm approach, we identified a homozygous deletion of 21,379bp in the ZNF277 gene, overlapping exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and ex pressive SLI. This deletion was of particular interest as it falls within the AUTS1 region of linkage to autism. ZNF277 flanks the DOCK4 and IMMP2L genes, which have been suggested to play a role in autism dis orders (ASD). We therefore screened cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and control subjects for the presence of ZNF277 deletions. We observed an increased frequency of ZNF277 deletions in probands with SLI (6/318, 1.9%) compared to both probands with ASD (1/253, 0.4%) and indepen dent controls (2/224, 0.8%). We performed quantitative PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277 in lymphoblastoid cell lines car rying either a DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. We found that, while ZNF277 microdeletions affect the expression of ZNF277 , they do not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Similarly, DOCK4 mi crodeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277 . Given these fin dings, we postulate that ZNF277 microdeletions may contribute to the risk of speech and language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risks previously described in this region.

Previous segregation analyses of autism have revealed that some subsets of autism may be caused by autosomal recessive mechanism . Consanguineous pedigrees facilitate the recognition and mapping of recessively inherited neurological disorder . The goal of this study is to use the Arabic Middle Eastern populations to map and identify autosomal recessive autism genes in order to better understand their classification, pathogenesis, and potential treatments . We so far have recruited 65 consanguineous families with autistic children, 20 out of which are multiplex families . SignatureChip Human Genome Microarray were performed on probands from 35 families, and chromosomal anomalies were detected in 6 cases; interestingly, all patients with chromosome deletions or duplications were from families with one affected individual, underscoring the importance of cytogenetic testings in ASD, especially in families with one affected child . Moreover, the male:female ratio in multiplex families was 2 .8:1 (37 males:13 females), which appears to be lower than the typical male:female ratio of 4:1 . These data support our hypothesis that ASD in some families may be caused by autosomal recessive inheritance . Linkage analyses were conducted in multiplex families . One family maps to the AUTS1 locus on chromosome 7q, whereas others map to novel autism loci with multipoint LOD score of 2 .4 2 .78 generated from single families without pooling .

Furthermore the boy suffers from seizures since the age of 16 years. Intelligence is in normal range. The patient finished non classical secondary school with good marks. Afterwards he tried to graduate from expert school for social sciences which could not be completed because of his special defects in social competence and communication skills, and his deficiency of empathy which, at the end of the initiated diagnostic procedure, led to the diagnosis of autism.

We were able to show a duplication of the region of interest with the proof of three alleles for the internal markers D15S122, D15S822 and D15S1234. Furthermore we could confirm this result with FISH using the probe GABRB3 (15q11 12),which showed three signals on meta and inter phase chromosomes. Parental investigations (FISH and molecular analysis) were inconspic uous. Microsatellite analysis showed that the duplication did arise from the boy`s maternal chromosome 15, as described in the literature (2).

","autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide. Several groups have identified associations between autism and a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism, who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7 megabases. The region contains approximately 16 known genes and 16 ESTs, a number of which are potential candidates for autism.

Several groups have identified associations between autism and a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism, who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7 megabases. The region contains approximately 16 known genes and 16 ESTs, a number of which are potential candidates for autism. We present results of a wider study for the presence of submicroscopic microdeletions, and of candidate genes, incorporating both linkage disequilibrium and mutational screening approaches in a panel of 77 Irish families with autism within the mapped region.

However, a great deal of the heritable variation associated with common traits remains unaccounted for within the geno me. The objective of this study is to discover large parts of additive gene tic variance not typically associated with autism through GWASD  in Korean population and estimates of ASD heritability. Subjects with ASD were recruited through the Korean autism Genetic Study Consortium. Each child was diagnosed as ASD by using the Korean versions of ADOS and ADI R (Lord et al. 1994; Lord et al. 1997).Total 146 patients were genotyped on the Affymetrix 5.0 platform. Geno type data for n,858 sex matched controls were drawn from the Korea As sociation Resource database. Genotype data were filtered for <5% missing ness/sample or /SNP; MAF >0.01; HWE p>0.0001. Cases were verified as unrelated using identity by descent estimation in PLINK v1.07. In order to examine the missing heritability in ASD, we applied genome wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) to 142 case and 842 controls after data filtering. The results identified phenotypic variants of 84.5% (Â±0.313 SE) with affec ted status of ASD, 7.0% (Â±0.027 SE) with topGWASD  SNPs (Â± 1mb region) and 81.0%(Â± 0.313 SE) with nonGWASD  SNPs. Increase from the genetic variance identified by top GWASD  hits region indicates there might be more risk loci to be identified.

ASD  is caused by mutations in the ALMS1 gene, which comprises >224 kb of genomic DNA, 23 exons and encoding a predicted 461.2 kDa protein with unknown func tion. CGC Genetics is the reference laboratory for AlstrÃÂ¶m syndrome International. Here we report our experience and contribution for the identification of new AlstrÃÂ¶m patients. Method: In 2004 2008, we received 52 samples for ALMS1 gene anal ysis from 8 different countries, from patients with clinically established diagnosis and also from patients clinically suspected for ASD.  Our ap proach for the molecular genetic testing was the complete sequence analysis of exons 10 and 16, plus a portion of exon 8. Results: Causative mutations (missense) were identified in 13 patients in both alleles and also 6 new nonsense mutations. In 6 patients we found a causative mutation only on one chromosome. Conclusion: Being a rare disorder and not commonly known, ASD  is most probably underdiagnosed, has delayed diagnosis or is even mis diagnosis. Genetic test allows an earlier diagnosis of the disease. Ef forts are being made to increase the detection rate by detecting large deletions.",2009,,,"Currently, 300 individuals with ASD  have been identified in 44 different countries.",individual with ASD,,individual,

The genes studied are: FMR1, MECP2, CDKL5, ARX, and methylation analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN. Multi plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was used to look for large deletions/duplications, to screen for microdeletion syn dromes, and to clarify methylation status of FMR1 and SNRPN genes. Our results in the group of FXS revealed about 12% mutations in the FMR1 gene. A mosaic case full mutation/normal allele was detected. The genetic tests in the group of RTT girls revealed about 26% muta tions along the MECP2 gene. No CDKL5 gene mutations were detect ed. The genetic tests in the group of PWS/ASD  revealed 64% mutations along the 15q11 q13 region. The MLPA analysis in the group of MDS revealed genetically confirmed cases with diagnosis Williams Beuren and Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome. Altogether, we manage to clarify the molecular basis in about 30% of our mentally retarded patients. The percentage of genetically proved diagnosis among our RTT patients, PWS/ASD  and MDS cases is relatively high, which represents a good clinical recognition of these pathological entities. On the contrary, the percentage of the genetically confirmed FXS cases is relatively low. Most probably this is due to the characteristics of this group, being clinically mixed and containing some definite autistic cases.

445,781,11,"Neurogenetic pathways regulated by FOXP2, a gene  implicated in speech and language",PL3.1,S. E. Fisher,"Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford, United Kingdom","People who carry rare heterozygous mutations disrupting the FOXP2 gene have problems mastering the complex sequences of mouth movements needed for speech, along with deficits in many aspects of expressive and receptive language. The gene encodes a highly conserved transcription factor that helps regulate development and function of neuronal subpopulations in a wide range of non speak ing vertebrates, although evidence suggests that its role(s) may have been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that FOXP2 is not the mythical Ã¢ÂÂgene for speechÃ¢ÂÂ, but represents one piece of a complex puzzle. I will describe how FOXP2 can be used as a unique window into key neurogenetic pathways via an array of complemen tary approaches. For example, using functional genomic screening of human neurons grown in the laboratory, we identified the CNTNAP2 gene (a member of the neurexin superfamily) as a downstream target directly regulated by FOXP2 . Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2 is itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children. High throughput screening has enabled us to isolate additional pu tative targets of FOXP2 , including multiple genes involved in neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Moving to animal models of FOXP2 dysfunction, we have shown that point mutations implicated in human speech deficits yield impaired motor skill learning in mutant mice. Electrophysiological recording suggests that this may be mediated by altered plasticity of Foxp2 expressing circuitry. Together with findings from other model systems, these data indicate that the contributions of FOXP2 to human speech and language are built on evolutionarily ancient roles in neural circuits involved in sensorimotor integration and motor skill learning. Overall, this work demonstrates how we can be gin to bridge gaps between molecules, neurons and the brain, helping us to build more sophisticated models of the relationships between genes, speech and language.",2010,,,"Intriguingly, we found that CNTNAP2 is itself associated with common cases of language impairment; this tar get has also been implicated in language delays of autistic children.",,autistic child,,child

Bicho","Genetic Laboratory,Medical Shool,University of Lisbon, Lisboa,  Portugal","The serotonin transporter gene is a likely candidate in autism. The aim of this study is to determine a possible association between polymorphisms 5 HTTVNTR and 5 HTTLPR in serotonin transporter gene and autism. Materials and Methods. 59 individuals with idiopathic autism, 47mothers, 33 fathers (28nuclear families), 59 controls. Ages between 3.6 and 41y. We studied the two polymorphic regions : promoter(5 HTTLPR) with a long or short allele and intron 2 (5 HTTVNTR) with fragments of 9, 10, 12 repeats. Results. There were no differences between the genotype and allelic frequencies of autistic individuals and control group in both polymorphisms.

Brodsky","Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States","Chorioretinal lacunae (PCRL) consist of well circumscribed, full thickness defects of retinal pigment epithelium and choroid, with intact overlying re tina. Although pathognomonic for Aicardi syndrome (ASD) , PCRL are seen in other conditions including microcephaly with chorioretinal degeneration, oral facial digital, oculo auricular syndrome. ASD  is characterized by agenesis of corpus callosum, seizures and PCRL. Inhe ritance is presumed X linked dominant but causative gene is unknown. We present girl without the classic ASD  triad who had PCRL due to chromosome 3 microdeletion.18 month old girl was evaluated for speech, motor delays, staring spells. She was born at 32 weeks gestation to pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia. At birth, was noted to have left hand preaxial polydactyly, atrial septal de fect, pulmonary valvular stenosis.

Retinal examination showed bilateral PCRL, which consisted of depigmented areas with variably pigmentated borders, surrounding optic discs. MRI revealed mild thinning of corpus callosum and diffuse hypomyelination. Genomic hybridization microarray demonstrated 6 megabase interstitial deletion of chromosome 3, spanning 3q21.3 to 3q22.1. Conclusions: PCRL are not unique to Aicardi syndrome. ASD  is thought to arise from gene mutation on X chromosome. Our patientâs large autosomal deletion comprised 66 genes, none known to be associated with chorioretinal lacunae. It is possible that PCRL in our and patients with ASD  may result from complex gene interactions between the X chromosome and autosomes. Because our patient had autosomal microdeletion, we recommend chromo somal microarray be performed in patients with PCRL when neurological features do not correspond to those in ASD.  R.

Many genetic and environmental factors are incriminated in its pathogenesis. Subacute exposure to organophosphates (OPs) during critical periods of prenatal neurodevelopment is one of the factors that may trigger autism. Human serum paraoxonase (PON1) is a HDL associated hydrolase, which in addition to hydrolyzing the OPs, plays a physiological role in reducing LDL oxidation. The PON1 gene shows two functional polymorphisms: M55L and Q192R. These polymorphisms influence the concentration and activity of PON1 towards different substrates, including OPs. The gene environment interaction is tested in the present study by assessing the distribution and frequency of M55L and Q192R polymorphisms in 58 autistic children and 43 controls. No significant difference (p>0.05) in genotypes distribution was found between autistic patients and controls (QQ 51.72%, QR 43.1%, RR 5.17% / MM 12.1%, ML 60.3%, LL 27.6% for autistic group and QQ 51.16%, QR 44.18%, RR 4.65% / MM 9.3%, ML 53.5%, LL 37.2% for control group).Although, the paraoxonase activity did not present a significant difference between the patients and controls (p>0.05), there was a significant activity increase in the autistic groups with R allele number and both in autistic and control groups with L allele number (p<0.05).

BabesÃ¢ÂÂ, Timisoara, Romania. Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman (ASD)  syndrome are distinct neurogenetic disorder, caused by chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy or loss of the imprinted gene expression in 15q11 13 region. While PWS occurs from a lack of the paternally expressed gene contribution, ASD  originates from a lack of the maternally expressed gene expression in the region, specifically UBE3A. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical diagnosis using different comparative molecular methods. The study group consisted in 14 children (age 2 10 years) presumptively diagnosed with PWS and one case with ASD  at UMF Timisoara Pediatric Hospital and 10 normal patients (control).DNA and RNA samples were isolated from white cell blood. For MS PCR 700ng of DNA was sodium bisufite treated. RNA samples were reverstranscribed with Access Quick Kit (Promega). Epigenetic changes at SNRPN gene locus were evaluated with MS PCR technique. Two non imprinted genes expression (NIPA1 and OCA2) was evaluated by qReal Time PCR for identification of deletions type 1,2,3. SALSA MS MLPA kit ME028 was used to detect copy number changes and to analyze CpG islands methylation of the 15q11 region.4/14 children presented deletions type 1,2,3 and 6/14 display imprinting defect (all PWS). In children with 15q11 13 deletions, no or poor NIPA1, OCA2 gene expression was found, depending on deletion type. The deletions was confirmed in FISH and MLPA analysis thus recommending NIPA1 and OCA2 gene expression as an alternate method for deletions investigation.",2011,,,The study group consisted in 14 children (age 2 10 years) presumptively diagnosed with PWS and one case with ASD  at UMF Timisoara Pediatric Hospital and 10 normal patients (control).DNA and RNA samples were isolated from white cell blood.,case with ASD,,case,

A drawback of these methods is that it is difficult to adequately control for population substructure and/or admixture and spurious associations can occur. For rare variants this problem can be sub stantial, because the spectrum of rare variation can differ greatly between populations. A solution is to perform analysis using the transmission dise quilibrium test (TDT), which was developed to analyze trio data and is ro bust to population substructure/admixture. Sequence data is being genera ted on trios to detect de Novo events, and is also useful to detect association with transmitted variants. We extended the TDT to test for rare variant (RV) associations using four commonly used rare variant association methods. We demonstrate that for all RV TDT tests type I error is well controlled even when there are high levels of population substructure or admixture. The po wer of the RV TDT tests was evaluated using a number of population genetic and disease models. The RV TDT was used to analyze exome data from 199 Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) autism trios. Using the RV TDT an associa tion was found between autism and rare variants in the ABCA7 gene. Given the problem of adequately controlling for population heterogeneity in rare variant association studies and the growing number of sequenced based trio studies the RV TDT is extremely beneficial to elucidate the involvement of rare variants in the etiology of complex traits.

Senese, Siena, Italy, 3Medical  Genetics, UniversitÃÂ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.   ","Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism (A) are classified as separate disorder. Recently, the identification of the Preserved Speech Variant (PSV), where autistic behavior is usual, stressed the phenotypic overlap between these two conditions. In 1999 it was shown that about 80% of RTT cases have a de novo mutation in the transcriptional silencer MECP2 gene, classifying RTT as a monogenic X L dominant disorder. Subsequently, we and others provided evidence that this model was too simple and not sufficient to explain why germline MECP2 mutations may result in X L mental retardation in males while they may be silent in carrier females. On the other hand, we and others have provided evidence that 15q11 q13 maternally inherited duplications are found in autistic children, suggesting that an abnormal dosage of gene(s) within this region might be responsible for A. Now we show that a proportion of RTT patients are carriers of both a MECP2 mutation and a 15q11 q13 duplication and that other RTT patients are carriers of a MECP2 mutation and a 15q11 q13 duplication. Therefore, we hypothesize a complex model in which a MECP2 mutation is necessary but not sufficient to cause the RTT phenotype in females, based on the status of a second gene which, at least in a proportion of cases, may be abnormal dosage of one or more 15q11 q13 gene. In summary, we provide preliminary evidence that A and RTT (clinically related for a long time) may have a common overlapping molecular basis.",2003,,,"On the other hand, we and others have provided evidence that 15q11 q13 maternally inherited duplications are found in autistic children, suggesting that an abnormal dosage of gene(s) within this region might be responsible for A.",,autistic child,,child

The most frequent form of ASD  is the X linked one (~85%) due to mutations in COL4A5 gene. To date, more than 400 different mutations have been identified in the COL4A5 gene, with Ã¢ÂÂprivateÃ¢ÂÂ point mutations being the most. We detected and studied for the first time in Greece and Cyprus clinically and molecularly 11 families with ASD.  Patients of these families showed some of the main characteristic features of Al port syndrome, including hematuria, proteinuria, chronic renal failure and hearing problems. In some of these families, characteristic ASD  bi opsy was available. X linked ASD  was inferred in 9 of these families and COL4A5 mutation screening was undertaken based on either linkage analysis results or clinical features only. Direct sequencing of the 51 exons of COL4A5 gene was performed by the use of an ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer. We identified three novel mutations in three of the families, E228X, P628L, 3075delT and one known mutation in two of the families, G624D. Interestingly, the two Greek families carry ing G624D mutation have a common haplotype flanking the COL4A5 gene, suggesting a founder effect. In addition, male patients in these families have a later manifestation of the disease. Our results will highly contribute in pre symptomatic and prenatal diagnosis in these families and will add to the international effort being made for genotype phenotype correlation in X linked ASD.

Bicho","Genetics Laboratory, Lisbon Medical School, Lisbon, Portugal","Serotonin is released in pre synaptic membrane and can reach spe cific receptors in post synaptic membrane or be partially reuptaked by its specific transporter at the synaptic cleft. Serotonin circulating levels and its effects depend on specific serotonin transporter activity whose efficacy changes with its gene polymorphisms. In that way, serotonin transporter gene may be a likely candidate in autistic dis order. The aim of this study is to determine a possible association between serotonin tranporter gene polymorphisms 5 HTTVNTR and 5 HTTLPR and autism and to evaluate intraplatelet serotonin concen tration. Patient group was made of 118 individuals (3,6 and 41 years) subdivid ed in 82 with idiopathic autism, 15 with pathology associated autism, 15 with PPD Nos and 6 with autism. Control group was made of 68 individuals (45,57ÃÂ±11,23 years). We studied 5 HTTLPR and 5 HTTVNTR by PCR and intraplatelet se rotonin concentration by ELISA. We found no significant differences in genotype and allelic frequencies between patient subgroups and between patient and control groups in both polymorphisms. we found a significant higher serotonina concentration in the patient group when compared with control individuals. We did not find sig nificant differences between the different genotypes of both polymor phisms and serotonin concentration. In this study we did no find any association between serotonin trans porter gene polymorphisms and autism. autistic patients have higher intraplatelet serotonin concentration, which may contribute for their characteristic behaviour disturbances.

One of those is mental retardation (MR) with developmental delay with an esti mated prevalence of 2 3% in the general population. Application of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) techniques to clinical practice, unraveled genetic aberration in MR patients with normal constitutional ka ryotype. Here we report a five year old girl with mental and motor retarda tion, epilepsy, and dysmorphic findings with normal constitutional karyo type. To determine the genetic contribution in the development of clinical findings, aCGH analysis was performed. Roche NimbleGen Human CGH ISCA Plus 3x1.4M Array was used for aCGH analysis. The data were analyzed by using Nexus6 software (BioDiscovery). As a result of aCGH analysis, 5 chro mosomal regions were marked as important regions. Among these regions, one of them has been found to be related with autism and intellectual disability, previously. Microdeletion in the PTCHD1 locus on Xp22.11 has been has been found in autism patients but not in he alty controls. However, we found a 24.3kb copy gain in the same locus in our patient. This finding showed that PTCHD1 locus may not be disrupted with deletion only, copy gain in that region might also have effect on the gene, and its function. Also, other identified copy gains and loss may have contributed to the accompanying dysmorphic findings.

Since some CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini cal significance of de novo and inherited CNVs containing genes being transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were grouped into four categories. First, de novo CNVs in families with both parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score.

Since some CNVs also occur in healthy individuals their contributions to the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype remain largely unclear. We systematically evaluated the clini cal significance of de novo and inherited CNVs containing genes being transcribed in the brain, by taking into account the Social Responsive ness Scale (SRS) scores of patients and both parents. Thus, CNVs were grouped into four categories. First, de novo CNVs in families with both parents having normal SRS scores, and second, CNVs inherited from a carrier parent with an elevated SRS score. These are the most likely to be causally related to ASD.

Several biological pathways have been highlighted, particularly the NMDA receptor multiprotein (NRC) complex, affected by copy number variations (CNV) and mutations enriched in NRC proteins encoding genes.

The NTRK2 gene encodes a receptor, TrkB, for neu rotrophin 4/5 and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which promotes neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptic function in the developing and adult nervous system . Intriguing observations, such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2 muta tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2 might be involved in au tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2 gene, were tested for as sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios. We found significant transmission disequilibrium of alleles at three markers in introns 5 6 and 15 16 (0 .011< P<0 .041) . Given this evidence for association, we genotyped these markers in a second population sample of 168 Irish trios . In the combined sample (N,491) we found an association of the same three SNPs at a more stringent P level (0 .006<P<0 .015), and found nominal associations with four additional markers in intron 22 23 (0 .0211< P<0.043). Previously we have described a significant in crease of plasma BDNF levels in approximately 30% of our patients . We therefore screened NTRK2 exons encoding ligand binding and catalytic regions ( exons 6, 7, 12, 18, 20 24) for mutations in 20 autis tic individuals with increased BDNF levels and 10 controls . No muta tions were identified in these individuals, and there was no evidence for association of NTRK2 with plasma BDNF distribution . The overall results therefore suggest that NTRK2 may be a susceptibility gene for autism, but its impact on autism is not mediated by the increased BDNF levels .",2008,,,"Intriguing observations, such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2 muta tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2 might be involved in au tism .",,autistic child,,child

From family and twin studies there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a further 69 sibling pair families. Four regions of linkage were identifi ed including chromosome 2q (MLS 3.74), 7q (MLS 3.20), 16p (MLS 2.93) and 17q (MLS 2.34), three of which have been replicated by other groups. Candidate gene and association studies are now in progress in order to isolate the susceptibility genes at these loci. On chromosome 7q31, the FOXP2 gene is mutated in a severe monogenic form of speech and language impairment and encodes a transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead domain. FOXP2 was tested for association and mutation in both complex language impairments and autism. No association or coding region variants in FOXP2 were found and the gene is therefore unlikely to play a major role in autism or more common forms of language impairment.",2002,,,83 sibling pairs families with autism were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a further 69 sibling pair families.,family with autism,,family,

It is characterized by deficits in language, social in teraction and repetitive behaviors. I will summarize our findings regarding the discovery of genetic mutations and their contribution to autism and developmental delay (DD). I will present evidence from exome and molecular inversion probe sequencing of more than 10,000 children with simplex autism and show how these data may be used to pin point specific genes. The emerging data strongly argue that the develop ment of the human brain is particularly sensitive to the timing and expres sion of many different genes; multiple genetic perturbations within specific neurodevelopmental pathways related to long term potentiation, chromatin remodeling, synaptic function and Wnt signaling appear particularly impor tant; and that the maternal and paternal contributions differ significantly. I will present data on how grouping patients based on a specific gene can be used to predict clinical subtypes of autism. Next generation exome and ge nome sequencing data provide a powerful path forward for understanding the genetic architecture of these disease but the heterogeneity demands an unprecedented level of global cooperation and networking.",2016,,,"I will present evidence from exome and molecular inversion probe sequencing of more than 10,000 children with simplex autism and show how these data may be used to pin point specific genes.",child with simplex autism,,child,
