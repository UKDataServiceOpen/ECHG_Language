Therefore we conclude might not protect well against lipid oxidation, a major atherogenic pathway. that the cholesterol-lowering gene affects also Lp(a) levels. Thus, the RR genotype of the PON1 gene may be considered to be an independent risk factor for MI in men at the age of 45 years.

This resulted in identifica- tion of a 5.6 kb cDNAfor an unknown canine gene, containing 4,503 nt of coding sequence and predicted to encode a protein of 1,500 amino acids. The gene shows about 90% homology to the human GRF1 and human and rat p190genes at both the nucleotide and protein levels.
