His karyotype from lymphocytes was normal (46,XY). boy presented severe mental and speech delay, tetraparesis, brain According to his clinical picture (facial dysmophism, failure to thrive cyst, large prominent malformed ears, hearing loss, arched eyebrows, and heart anomaly) Noonan syndrome was clinically diagnosed at the long palpebral fissures, nystagmus, strabismus, bilateral coloboma age of 1 year although no mutations in PTPN11 and KRAS genes was of iris, chorioidea and optic nerves, myopia, cataracts, high palate, detected. At the same age the iron deficiency anaemia was diagnosed malocclusion of teeth, scoliosis, thorax deformation, flat feet. Heart and in the second year of life he has blood in the stool. At the age defect (AVC, VSD, insufficiency of valves). At the time of counseling of 4 years polyps were found all over the GI tract. His development mother was pregnant and underwent to standard combined prenatal was delayed, he was dysmorphic with macrocephaly (+4 SD), in MRT screening. No fetal malformations were detected.

Introduction: Single nucleotide variantions (SNVs) of the ANKK1 gene have Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequent been reported to be associated with a wide spectrum of dopamine-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

It is caused by microdeletion of 1.5 to 1.8Mb in 7q.11.23 region. We studied 31 WBS patients (20 M and 12 F) and their age ranged from 9 to 26 years (median 14y). The diagnosis of WBS was confirmed by FISH, MLPA or micro satellite markers analysis in all patients. The objectives were to evaluate cognitive ability, the execution IQ, verbal and total, the frequency of visual-spatial deficits and autistic traits. The tests used were: WISC-III, WAIS-III, Rey Complex Figure and scale of autistic traits (ATA).
