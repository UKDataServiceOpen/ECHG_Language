Two FH mutation carriers had kidney cancer; the histological subtypes were papillary type 2 and Wilms’ tumour, respectively. Interpretation All FH mutation positive families harboured patients with cutaneous leiomyomas, contrasting with none of the families negative for FH mutations. An MLPA test should be part of FH mutation testing. FH mutation carriers frequently had early-onset, severely symptomatic uterine leiomyomas, whereas renal cancer was infrequent.
