In case of isolated ACC (iACC), neurodevelopment is within normal range in 80 % of cases whereas 20 % of children presentmild to severe intellectual disability (ID). Among genetic etiologies, only chromosomal causes are investigated (karyotyping and microarray) during prenatal period whileACC with ID is due to a single gene mutation in most cases.1234567890();,: 1234567890();,:Thus, parents make the decision to continue or terminate the pregnancy on statistics. Our study aims to evaluate the feasibility of prenatal testing of all known ACC genes using whole exome sequencing (WES). Eighteen fetuses with ACC were included (ongoing inclusions): 14 iACC and 4 cases of ACC associated to other anomalies (aACC). Trio WES were performed on fetal DNA extracted from amniotic ï¬uid sampling. Only patho genic variants in known ACC genes were considered. Variants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VUS) and secondary ï¬ndings were not reported. WES results were available within an average of 21 days. Thirteen WES (72%) were normal (11 iACC, 2 aACC). A pathogenic variant in an ACC with ID gene was identi ï¬ed in two cases (11%): BRAT1 (aACC) and PPP2R1A (iACC). A pathogenic 6q27 deletion was identi ï¬ed in one case (aACC). We identi ï¬ed a VUS in 2 cases. Our preliminary results suggest feasibility of prenatal WES in fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of ACC. In case of etiological diagnosis, WES helps the parents to make adecision for the pregnancy. However, WES in the prenatal period arises ethical questions. S. Heide: None. B. Keren: None. M.

Methods: A retrospective review ofour amniocentesis database for the period from January 2000 to February 2019 was carried out. The karyotyping of8361 fetuses was carried out in Department of Medical Biology from the samples of amniotic ï¬uids which were sent from Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Balcali Hospital. A standard nomenclature has been developed to describe each of types of abnormality found in human chromosomes. Results: A total of 8361 amniocentesis specimens were processed during the study period. 601 fetuses (7.18%) had various chromosomal abnormalities. 54.4% of abnormalkaryotypes (329 cases) were numerical and 43.09% (259 cases) were structural. Both numerical and structural chro mosomal aberrations were observed in 13 cases (2.16%).The ratios were as: trisomy 21 (48.93%), trisomy 18 (17.93%), monosomy X (9.72%), trisomy 13 (6.99%), Triploidy (4.86%), Klinefelter Syndrome (3.34%), TrisomyX (1.21%), XYY Syndrome (0.91%), and the others in all numerical abnormalities. The frequent structural abnormal ities were as: 46,XX/XY, inv(9) (p11;q12)/(p11;q13)(29.34%), 46,XX/XY, 1qh( +)(11.58%), 46,XY, Yqh( ) (7.33%), 46,XX/XY, 16qh( +)(7.33%), 46,XX/XY, 9qh( +) (4.63%) and 46,XY, Yqh( +)(4.24%). Balanced and unba lanced translocations, deletions and duplications were also found in less ratio. Conclusions: According to the literature and our results, advanced maternal age is the main cause of fetal chromo somal abnormalities. Fetal chromosomal abnormality ratio that we found was 7.18%. This ratio emphasizes theimportance of prenatal diagnosis. A. Pazarbasi: None. D. Alptekin: None. I. N. Uslu: None. N. S. Ilgaz: None. L. Ozpak: None. G. Comertpay: None. G. Ay: None. N.

This severeAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1175neurodevelopmental disease is characterized by intellectual disability associated with epilepsy and spasticity. Brain imaging shows the association of pontocerebellar anoma lies, agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) and microcephaly. The 2 fetuses already reported with mutations in this gene had HPC associated with ACC on prenatal ultrasound orMRI. We report two cases of AMPD2 mutations in sibling fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of isolated ACC (iACC). Cases: Male fetus 1 : prenatal iACC at 32 gestational weeks (GW) ; termination of pregnancy (top) at 37GW, normal CGH array; postnatal iACC (neuropathological examination). Male fetus 2: prenatal iACC ; top at 31 GW;normal CGH array; postnatal iACC (neuropathological examination). Method: Whole exome sequencing (2 fetuses and 2 parents). Results: Identi ï¬cation of two compound heterozygous AMPD2 mutations (c.751C>T, p. Arg251Trp; c.1648G>A, p. Glu550Lys) in the 2 fetuses. Discussion: We report here an unusual prenatal pre sentation of PCH9 in 2 sibling fetuses, limited to a prenataland postnatal iACC. ACC is one of the most frequent brain malformations, usually detected by prenatal ultrasound. Prognosis is variable and correlates with the presence orabsence of other malformations. When isolated, the neuro development is within a normal range in 80 % of cases whereas 20 % have mild to severe intellectual disability. Establishing an etiological diagnosis of a prenatal appar ently iACC is essential to assess neurodevelopmental prognosis. AMPD2 should be considered as a gene responsible for isolated prenatal ACC.

Tro ï¬mov National medical research center for obstetrics, gynecology and perinatology named after academician, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Noninvasive prenatal DNA screening (NIPS) is believed to be highly sensitive to common aneuploidy detection. Since some NIPS technologies use whole genomesequencing, aneuploidies and large CNV of any chromo some could be detected. Although detection of rareaneuploidies and large CNV is possible it is not recommended in Obstetricians and Gynecologists guide lines. Majority of NIPS providers do not report this information. Materials and Methods: NIPS was carried on Ion S5 sequencer with in house developed data analysis pipe line. 1300 samples collected at 11 20 weeks of gestation were analyzed. NIPS results were con ï¬rmed with kar yotyping of invasively obtained samples or blood cellsobtained postnatally. Four biopsies of placental tissue were performed to assess placental karyotype. Results: High aneuploidy risk was detected in 39 cases. 14 trisomy 21, 3 trisomy 13, 15 sex chromosome abnormalities (4 due to maternal mosaicism) and 7 rare autosomal abnormalities (trisomies 7, 8, 10, large CNV). Inone case large CNV was con ï¬rmed in the fetus. In two cases of rare trisomies, placental tissue was available, in both cases, mosaic trisomy was con ï¬rmed in the placenta. Conclusions: High risk of rare autosomal abnormality could be associated with miscarriage, con ï¬ned placental mosaicism, true fetal mosaicism, and uniparental disomies.

30062,"Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, PolandSpontaneous abortions occur in 8 20% cases of recognized pregnancies. Most often, the miscarriage take place in theï¬rst trimester (7 11 weeks). There are many causes of pregnancy loss, but the most important (~75%) is the presence of chromosomal aberrations. A high percentage ofchromosomal aberration is caused by the abnormal genetic material of germ cells. Research showed that 20 30% of ovaand 6 8% of sperm showed chromosomal abnormalities. This percentage signi ï¬cantly increases with advancing age in women and in cases of abnormalities of sperm in men. We present the results of oligonucleotide array applica tion in a cohort of 31 cases of mothers with adverse preg nancy histories. DNA was extracted from trophoblast andumbilical cord. Array CGH was performed using 4x180K microarrays from Oxford Gene Technology (CytoSure ISCA, v3). The detection rate in our cohort was 61,3% (19/31). The most commonly found (73,7%) were aneuploidies: trisomy of chromosomes 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, Turner syndrome andtriploidy. Other chromosomal abnormalities included structural aberrations: deletion 7p22.3p12.3 and duplication 9p24.3p13.2 inherited from normal father, deletion3q13.31q22.2, deletion 3q22.3q23, duplication 17p12 inherited from father with foot malformations, deletion 17p13.1 inherited from normal mother, deletion 5q14.3 andde novo deletion 1q21.1q21.2.

Microdeletions/partial deletions of the azoos permia factor(AZF) regions on the Y chromosome are a well known genetic cause of male infertility, resulting in impairment of spermatogenesis. We sought to determine thefrequency and the character of AZF region microdeletions/ partial deletions in infertile men with azoospermia by usingAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1177Multiplex Ligation Related Probe Ampli ï¬cation (MLPA). In total, 50 azoospermic infertile men without gene and chromosome mutations, were screened for Y chromosome microdeletions in AZF regions and 50 fertile men assigned to control group. The total frequency of the microdeletions was 16%. Most deletions (10%) were seen in the AZFcfollowed by the AZFb (4%). The partial BPY2 gene deletions, located at AZFc region were detected in ï¬ve patients while partial EIF1AY gene deletions, located inAZFb locus were seen in two patients. The combined AZFb and AZFc loci deletion was revealed in a patient. No AZFa region deletion was detected among the azoospermic cases. In the literature, it has been shown that BPY2 gene is effective in male germ cell development and loss of EIF1AY gene function can result in azoospermia sporadi cally. The present ï¬ndings suggest that MLPA is more appropriate compared to mPCR because it investigates partial and complete deletions of AZF regions for malesterility compared to previous methods. Our study shows that microdeletion and partial deletions, which are men tioned in the literature as the reason of azoospermia, can bedetected by MLPA method at the same time. K. Haziyeva: None. O.

Phenotypic information is essential for genetic testing and counselling. However antenatal ultrasonographyidenti ï¬es only up to 68% of autopsy ï¬ndings, which are not always available. Post mortem imaging using microfocus computed tomo graphy (micro CT) provides an alternative, or com plementary tool, to autopsy. It provides high resolution, 3Ddigital images, which may enable accurate diagnosis of complex multisystem syndromes, in particular in small early gestation fetuses. We describe the case of a 33 year old primigravida, who attended for antenatal sonography at 12 +5weeks gestation. An increased nuchal translucency and hypoplastic left heartwere observed; multicystic kidneys suspected. Array CGH was normal. The couple opted to terminate the pregnancy at 15 +6weeks. Due to small foetal size, whole body micro CT was performed. Image analysis revealed an atrioventricular septal defect, mitral valve stenosis, left ventricular hypo plasia, aortic atresia and ascending and aortic arch hypo plasia. Multiple renal cortical cysts and bilateral upper and lower limb post axial polydactyly were observed. Renalhistology con ï¬rmed extensive cystic dilatation of the renal tubules. Genetic testing identi ï¬ed compound heterozygous muta tions in BBS7 [c.187G>A; p.(Gly63Arg)mat and c.973G>T; p.(Glu325Ter)pat], consistent with Bardet Biedl Syndrome. Given a recurrence risk for future pregnancies at 25%, thecouple received counselling regarding future preimplanta tion genetic testing. In conclusion, micro CT is a non invasive highly detailed method for assessing early gestation foetal anatomy, and provides an adjunctive or alternative tool to the standard foetal autopsy technique.

Several incidences were reported concerning negative psychosocial impact, i.e., anxiety and dif ï¬culty in making decision on reproductive option. Material and Methods: Forty healthy Thai couples visiting preconception clinic were enrolled. ECS was per formed using 630 disease panel covering most autosomal recessive and X linked disorders. Thereafter, attitudes on ECS and clinical application were interviewed. Genetic datawere then combined with previous in house database, pooling up to 355 unrelated individuals. Carrier identi ï¬ca tion were interpreted using our developed bioinformatic andclinical criteria suitable for legal and ethical issues. Results: The most common carrier frequency in our cohort belonged to beta thalassemia (1/5) which was con sistent with national statistics. Interestingly, primary hemochromatosis H63D, which have never been recognised in Southeast Asian populations, became the second com mon (1/16). Other carriers detected as common in Thais included alpha thalassemia, Gilbert syndrome, 21 hydroxylase de ï¬cient congenital adrenal hyperplasia and spinal muscular atrophy. More than 95% of the subjects had a positive attitude to ECS. They accepted preimplantation genetic diagnosis as their reproductive option if they wereidenti ï¬ed as couples at risk, either mild or severe condition. Conclusions: ECS would be useful if the selection cri teria were clear and consistent with national regulation andethics.

30066,"test aimed at identifying prospective healthy parents whoare at risk of conceiving a child affected with a recessive disorder. ECS tests screen for large numbers of recessive disorders and are currently available through variousgenetic testing laboratories. However, the extent to which ECS can be successfully implemented in the context ofreproductive healthcare depends largely on prospective parents âinterest in ECS. In this systematic review, we synthesized evidence from empirical studies exploring interest in ECS among individuals and couples in the general population. Studies included in this review reported prospective parents âintentions to undergo a (hypothetical) ECS test, uptake of an actual ECS offer, or both. Four databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library) were systematically searched for relevant publica tions and 12 empirical studies were included in the review. Owing to the novelty of ECS, all the included studies were relatively recent, having been published during 2015 2019.In the included studies, 33% 66% of respondents were interested in a (hypothetical) ECS test, while uptake rates for actual ECS offers were reported at 10% 50%. Thehighest uptake was observed in a study where ECS was offered to pregnant women. By contrast, studies focusing on the preconception population reported lower uptake rates,even though some of these preconceptional ECS tests were provided free of charge. Our ï¬ndings suggest that there may be discrepancies between prospective parents âself reported intentions to undergo ECS and their actual test taking behavior, particularly during the preconception period.

Methods: Data from all CMA tests performed due to sonographic abnormal ï¬ndings between January 2013 and September 2017 were retrospectively obtained from Min istry of Health computerized database. All singleton preg nancies with sonographic diagnosis of clubfoot (talipes equinovarus) and documentation of CMA result were included. Results: Of the 5750 CMA tests, a total of 269 (4.7%) were performed due to demonstration of fetal clubfoot. Of the 229 cases with isolated deformity, nine (3.9%) clinicallysigniï¬cant CMA results were detected.

In 40 pregnancies withsyndromic clubfoot, seven (17.5%) clinically signi ï¬cant CMA results were detected, a signi ï¬cantly higher frequency compared to isolated clubfoot cases. Conclusion: Sonographic diagnosis of clubfoot, whether isolated or associated with additional sonographic anoma lies, seems to increase the risk for abnormal CMA ï¬ndings.

There have been many publications before demonstrating the bene ï¬t of CMA in detecting micro duplications and microdeletions in the prenatal setting. Aimof this study is to evaluate the association between prenatal CMA and the decision on termination of pregnancy. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of a single prenatal center in Austria between 2011 and 2017, including all fetuses that had prenatal diagnosis with CMA. Results: In general highest rates of pathogenic CNVs were found if the indication for prenatal diagnosis was congenital heart disease or brain malformations. There was a statistical signi ï¬cant association between pathogenic CNV and the decision on termination of pregnancy (p<0,05). But comparing pregnancy outcomes with prenatal CMA andwithout CMA, irrespective of the result of the CMA, we found signi ï¬cant fewer terminations of pregnancies in the group with CMA, even if the severity of malformations of the fetuses were comparable. Conclusions: In summary the decision on termination of pregnancy is individual and there are many in ï¬uencing factors to consider. However our data suggests that the result of additional CMA can be a crucial factor in the decision on termination of pregnancy. T. Reischer: None. J. Brandstetter: None. R. Dra honsky: None. C.

However, several studies have shown a higher incidence of selected types of congenital anomalies amongAR conceived children. Our goal was to study this association on a large population cohorts (over 3 millions of live births) using data from our population basedregistries. Methods: Our retrospective epidemiological study is based on the of ï¬cial data from the National Registry of Congenital Anomalies and National Registry of assisted Reproduction (run by the Institute of the Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic). The registrationprocess is population wide and compulsory by national law. We evaluated the incidence of congenital anomalies (ICD 10 diagnoses Q00 Q99) in AR conceived children andcompared it to the incidence of congenital anomalies in naturally conceived children. Time period: 2013 2015.1180Results: The overall incidence of congenital anomalies was slightly higher in the AR children group however, the difference was not statistically signi ï¬cant. The congenital anomalies were more common in twins (p<0.005). The incidence of congenital anomalies in AR twins was sig niï¬cantly higher than the incidence of congenital anomalies in non AR twins (p<0.005) while the difference of con genital anomalies incidence in AR and non AR singletons was not signi ï¬cant.

However, designing an ECS panel for Thais can be dif ï¬cult due to insuf ï¬cient variantfrequency data. Therefore, we conduct a study to gather the frequency of pathogenic variants in the associated diseases by offering ECS to a Thai couple who plan to conceive. Methods: DNA samples of 40 non consanguineous Thai couples were underwent sequencing by NGS in 540 genesassociated with AR and XLR diseases. We classi ï¬ed the variants detected by NGS using population databases (1000 Genomes Project, gnomAD, and our in house Thai exomedatabase) and diseases databases (Clinvar and HGMD professional) to determine their pathogenicity. Results: 76 variants with strong evidence for pathogeni city are identi ï¬ed. Deafness is the most common AR dis eases with six individuals carry deafness related variants in these genes: SLC26A4 ,USH2A ,OTOF , and MYO3A fol lowed by ï¬ve carriers of vision loss variants in GRM6, USH2A, EYS , and ABCA4 gene. One couple shared a dif ferent pathogenic mutation in the ABCA4 gene. Conclusions: Though deafness and vision loss are the two most common AR carrier found in the Thai population, consideration need to be taken if they were in the ECS panelbecause these phenotypes are not severe enough for a pre natal diagnosis.

Women with a high risk result from the combined ï¬rst trimester screening were invited to ï¬ll in two online questionnaires at GA 12 14(Q1) and GA 24(Q2). The scales used were Decisional Con ï¬ict and Regret Scales, Satisfaction with genetic Counselling Scale and Health Relevant Personality Inventory. Results: In total, 339 women were included, and the response rates were 76 % on Q1 and 88% on Q2, respec tively. Of the participants, 75.4% chose an invasive test and23.8% chose NIPT. The median DCS score among all participants was within the level associated with imple menting decisions, whereas 13.3% had a high level ofdecisional con ï¬ict. Choosing NIPT was associated with a high decisional con ï¬ict; receiving genetic counselling the same day was associated with a high decisional con ï¬ict; and a high satisfaction with the genetic counselling was asso ciated with low decisional con ï¬ict. Furthermore, âalex ithymia â, the personality sub trait that describes a disinterest or inability in identifying and understanding feelings, was associated with low decisional con ï¬ict. High decisional regret was associated with high decisional con ï¬ict and low satisfaction with genetic counselling. Conclusion: The results from this study show that satis faction with, and timing of counselling are essential factorsto limit decisional con ï¬ict. Also, the results indicate that women choosing NIPT have more decisional con ï¬ict compared to women choosing invasive testing. There was asigniï¬cant association between high decisional con ï¬ict and later decisional regret. C. Ingvoldstad Malmgren: None. T. SchlaikjÃ¦r Hartwig: None. C. Borregaard Miltoft: None. A.

Prenatal diagnosis (PND) or Pre implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) could be attractiveoptions to prevent the birth of new affected cases. Aneuploidies are the cause of over 50% of all miscarriages. Early aneuploidy screening in conjunction with PND orPGD can decrease the subsequent complication of preg nancy termination. Methods: This study aimed to develop a novel panel to conï¬rm detection of DMD/BMD and aneuploidy screening simultaneously. The panel functions on the principle of hemizygosity mapping of the 6 novels STR (Short TandemRepeat) markers linked to dystrophin gene. Additionally, this includes autosomal STR markers for the critical regions of Chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y. These markers wereampli ï¬ed in a time saving and cost effective multiplex PCR reaction. Results: Allele frequency and heterozygosity assessment of STR markers were studied in 250 unrelated healthy individuals. Totally, 85 alleles were detected. Hetero zygosity of markers was 75.7% 89.8%. Genotype fre quencies of markers were found to be in agreement with the Hardy âWeinberg equilibrium (P â¥0.1899). For further conï¬rmation direct mutation analysis was also performed. The results were compatible. The panel was used for more than 150 PND cases and 15 PGD candidates and the results were successful. Conclusion: This panel increases the accuracy and sen sitivity of diagnosis. It can be easily applied for PGD/PND of DMD, aneuploidy screening and sex determination.

Recurrent early pregnancy loss (REPL) affects 1 2% of couples and has a complex etiology. Approximately half of miscarriages from EPLcases are caused by chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo. Spontaneously lost pregnancies are characterized by shortened telomeres, especially in embryos withaneuploidies. Thus, short telomere length may be more frequent in women with REPL. Material and Methods: Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured in DNA isolated from the blood samples using a real time polymerase chain reaction approach. RTL was examined in three groups of women with EPL(N,171): (i) patients with single EPL (EPL1) (N ,52), (ii) patients with two EPL (EPL2) (N ,68), (iii) patients with REPL (N ,49); and control group (C) women who had healthy pregnancies with no history of infertility or mis carriage (N ,113). Results: The EPL group had signi ï¬cantly lower RTL than control (EPL: 1.39Â±0.06 versus C: 2.23Â±0.01, P,0.0000001). Average RTL were similar in EPL2 and REPL groups (1.36 Â±0.04 in EPL2 and 1.31Â±0.07 in RPL)and were signi ï¬cantly lower compared to control (EPL2: 1.36 Â±0.04 vs C: 2.23Â±0.01, P ,0.000001 and REPL: 1.31 Â±0.07 vs C: 2.23Â±0.01, P ,0.000001). Conclusions: Women experiencing two or more EPL have shorter telomeres. We assume that short telomeres in women are involved in complex factors that provoke earlypregnancy loss. N. Huleyuk: None. D.

Each cell type has its unique gene expression pro ï¬le, that compose whole tissue expression pattern. Materials and Methods: Using cell type speci ï¬c tran scriptome data and computational deconvolution approach,we estimated the epithelial and stromal cell proportions in whole tissue biopsies taken during early secretory (ES) and mid secretory (MS) phases. The estimated proportions wereused as covariates in whole tissue differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. For RNA sequencing we used paired ES and MS endometrial biopsies, obtained from 35healthy, fertile volunteers (23 36 years). DGE analysis was performed using two approaches with and without deconvolution step, and results compared with each other. Results: The estimated average proportions of stromal and epithelial cells in ES phase were 65% and 35%, and during MS phase 46% and 54%, that correlated with his tological evaluation (r ,0.88, p ,1.1Ã10 6). Endometrial DGE analysis showed 26% differentially expressed tran scripts (n ,946) in receptive endometrium in both cell type unadjusted and adjusted analyses. However, the other 74% (n,2,645) become statistically non signi ï¬cant after cell type adjustment, underlining the impact of tissue hetero geneity on DGE analysis. The results suggest new mechanisms involved in endometrial maturation involving genes like LINC01320, SLC8A1 and GGTA1P, describedfor the ï¬rst time in endometrial receptivity context. Conclusion: The better understanding of molecular pro cesses during transition from pre receptive to receptiveendometrium serves to improve the effectiveness of assisted reproduction protocols.

However, with the implementation of rapid âin utero âsequencing becoming eminently feasible, fetal phenotyping may, in future, rely onantenatal imaging alone. Aim: To determine whether the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with congenital anomalies following autopsy iscomparable to the yield of ES implemented at the time of antenatal ultrasound detection. Method: ES was prospectively performed on 51 fetal probands following autopsy as part of the Perinatal Autopsy Flagship of the Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance Demonstration Project. Candidate variants concordant withphenotypic ï¬ndings from fetal autopsy were classi ï¬ed by multidisciplinary review using ACMG guidelines. Inde pendently, a phenotype driven virtual gene panel for eachproband was derived from antenatal imaging reports by clinicians blinded to autopsy ï¬ndings. Where a pathogenic variant fell within this âpre autopsy âvirtual gene panel, this was viewed as a diagnosis that would have been made by combining WES with antenatal imaging alone. Results: The diagnostic rate in this cohort was 17/51 (33%) with 4 further variants awaiting functional validation. Phenotypes with the highest diagnostic yield included skeletal dysplasias (100%); multiple malformations (33%)and hydrops fetalis (33%). 14/17 of diagnoses would have been made on antenatal ï¬ndings alone while 3/17 additional diagnoses were made with ï¬ndings only apparent on autopsy.

Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the impact of pES on pregnancy outcome and pre or perinatal management in the ï¬rst 22, consecutively referred patients to our department for pES because of one or more structuralanomalies on fetal ultrasound. Results: In two cases, a diagnosis was made by chro mosomal microarray analysis after ES counselling. Theremaining 20 cases were divided in three groups; (1) pES to aid parental decision making (n ,12), (2) pES in the context of late pregnancy termination requests (n ,5) and (3) pES to guide prenatal or perinatal management (n ,3). pES had a clinical impact in 75% (9/12), 40% (2/5) and 100% (3/3) respectively, showing an overall clinical impactof pES of 70% (14/20).

In the absence of aneuploidy or cytogenetic causes, single gene disorders can be responsible; a recent review of 31 prenatal exome sequencing studies by Best et al., (2018) showed adiagnostic rate of 6.2% to 80%. We have undertaken exome sequencing at a single centre for cases of unexplained fetal anomaly in both ongoing and retro spective pregnancies. Materials and Methods: Patients with a fetal abnorm ality detected on ultrasound were referred to clinicalgenetics at St George âs Hospital, London. Fetal DNA was from CVS, amniotic ï¬uid, fetal blood or tissue. Maternal cell exclusion was performed where relevant. DNA wasenriched using the Agilent SureSelect CREv2 and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500. Variant analysis performed using Sapienita â¢. Gene panels and variant ï¬lter settings including Exomiser prioritisation were pre conï¬gured to expedite analysis. Results: In the ï¬rst year (2018), 42 families were referred for exome sequencing due to fetal anomaly. A diagnosis was made in 15 cases (36%); 9/17 singletons ( BICD2, FGFR2, LZTR1, NIPBL, PTPN11, RAF1, RMRP,SLC26A2, TSC1 ), 1/1 duo ( UBE2A ), 4/23 trios ( CHD7 , PIEZO1, POMGNT1, SLC6A9, TUBA1A ) and 0/1 quad. Updated ï¬gures will be presented. Conclusions: The diagnostic rate for this selected group is consistent with the literature and is higher than recent unselected cohort studies (Petrovski et al 2019, Lord et al2019). In several cases the molecular diagnosis was not the primary suspected clinical diagnosis emphasising the con tinued importance of expanding and publishing prenatalgenotype phenotype associations. S.

Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain Background: Genetic investigation is not routinely offered in early pregnancy loss due to its high failure and maternal cell contamination rates. Objective: To identify the genetic causes of early preg nancy losses, with the use of QF PCR and SNP array in chorionic villi samples obtained previously to evacuation. Methods: Women with a pregnancy loss before 13 weeks were offered transcervical chorionic villi sampling prior to surgical or medical uterine evacuation. During a 3 yearstudy period (September 2015 October 2018) 584 women consented. A ï¬rst round of QF PCR including chromo somes 21, 18, 13, X, Y and a second round with chromo somes 15, 16, and 22 were assessed. Concurrent karyotyping was also performed and SNP array when the chromosomes were normal. Results: Fifty ï¬ve (9%) samples were excluded after microscopic inspection because only maternal decidua could be retrieved. Among the 529 samples suitable foranalysis, a chromosomal anomaly was found in 159 (30%) cases at the ï¬rst QF PCR round, and 128 (24%) at the second round. The karyotype revealed 66 (12%) anomaliesundetected by QF PCR. Among the 176 remaining early losses with a normal karyotype, SNP array was performed in 90 cases with suf ï¬cient DNA ad 6 (2.4%) submicro scopic anomalies were found. Conclusions: QF PCR and SNP array in chorionic villi samples are able to provide a result in 91% of early preg nancy losses. Two rounds of QF PCR detected a chromo somal anomaly in 54% of the cases. If karyotyping is replaced by SNP array in QF PCR normal cases, further12% chromosomal anomalies, 2.4% submicroscopic anomalies and molar pregnancies will be revealed. A. Borrell: B.

Shoukier Praenatal Medizin MÃ¼nchen, Munich, GermanyIntroduction: Identifying the genetic cause of fetal brain malformations is a diagnostic challenge due to the geneticheterogeneity. We present here the results of multigene panel analysis (MGPA) of 65 fetuses with congenital brain malformations. Materials and Methods: From January to December 2018, 65 prenatal cases with fetal brain malformations (10 with minor extracerebral anomalies) were investigated bytargeted Next Generation Sequencing of the coding regions of 262 genes. Genes were selected from the developmental brain disorders database (DBDB) and results reportedwithin two weeks. Familial co segregation analysis for variant pathogenicity assessment was carried out, when necessary. Karyotypes and array CGH results of fetuseswere normal. Results: Pathogenic variants were identi ï¬ed in 10 (15%) out of the 65 cases. Mutations were found in a total of 8genes: TUBA1A and ASPM (2 cases respectively) as well as in GPSM2, FKRP, KAT6B, OFD1, TSEN54 and TUBB (1 case each). In addition variants of unclear signi ï¬cance were detected in 4 cases (6%). No mutation was identi ï¬ed in a total of 51 fetuses (79%). Our ï¬ndings show a strong correlation between the detection rate of causative muta tions and complexity of the fetal phenotype. Additionally, Trio based whole exome sequencing should be considered in cases with negative MGPA results to further improve thedetection rate. Conclusions: MGPA facilitates the identi ï¬cation of genetic causes with a good diagnostic yield and should beused for routine molecular genetic diagnosis of fetal brain malformations. D.

Diagnostic rates vary signi ï¬cantly, but with low diagnostic rates in isolated increased nuchal translu cency (NT) or cystic hygroma [Best et al 2018]. Materials and Methods: G5P2 with severe hydrops in 2 male fetuses (missed abortion week 19 and 20) and healthy children. Both hydrope fetuses presented with normal ï¬rst trimester scans. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was the presumed cause for the ï¬rst case of hydrops, as the mother ser oconverted just after the pregnancy. However, PCR forCMV was negative in tissue from the aborted fetuses. Array CGH was carried out on DNA obtained from amniotic ï¬uid from both pregnancies, but leaving both cases unresolved. WES was performed as trio on DNA extracted from amniotic ï¬uid from the second pregnancy, and both parents. Results were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: A novel variant in FOXP3 was identi ï¬ed in hemizygous state in the second pregnancy, inherited from the mother, and subsequently con ï¬rmed in cell culture from theï¬rst pregnancy. This variant is currently under further validation. Conclusions: Germline FOXP3 mutations cause immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy and enteropathy, X linked (IPEX) syndrome. This syndrome is well character ized in patients postnatally. Prenatally, mutations have beenreported to cause the loss of male fetuses as a result of fetal hydrops [Reichert et al. 2015]. This case adds to the body of knowledge suggesting that WES can improve our under standing of prenatal presentation of not only fetal mal formations but also isolated hydrops. S. Ringsted: None. L.

However, recent studies revealed that AGGinterruptions may decrease the risk of intergenerational expansion. Materials and Methods: All FMR1 premutation carriers who underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis (AC) at Sheba Medical Center during the period of 2011 2017 were included in this study. Toincrease the accuracy of our results, we combined results from Israel with those from the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities (IBR). FMR1PCR and Asuragen Kit were used to determine the number of CGG repeats and AGG interruptions in all women and fetuses. Results: The combined data included 1471 transmissions of maternal premutation alleles: 369 (25.1%) stable and 1,102 (74.9%) unstable transmissions. Full mutationexpansions were identi ï¬ed in 20.6% (303/1471) of trans missions. A total of 97.4% (388/397) of transmissions from alleles with no AGGs were unstable, compared to 79.6%(513/644) in alleles with 1 AGG and 46.7% (201/430) in alleles with 2 or more AGGs. 40% (159/397) of alleles with no AGGs expanded to a full mutation, compared to 20.2%(130/644) for alleles with 1 AGG and only 3.2% (14/430) in alleles with 2 AGGs or more. Conclusions: Based on this ethnically diverse data we recommend that the risk estimates for a full mutation expansion for FMR1 premutation carriers will include the number of AGG interruptions as well as CGG repeat size.

Test results of the couple âs chromosome analysis were normal, and there was no evidence of genetically relevant diseases in their families. Frozen skin cells of the ï¬rst abort had an insuf ï¬cient quality to perform gene panel analysis. Materials and Methods: Clinical exome sequencing (CES) was performed on the parents âDNA followed by screening for carrier status in 34 relevant genes for intrau terine fetal death. Results: In the maternal DNA sample, we identi ï¬ed a heterozygous novel mutation c.2423 1G>T in the FRAS1 gene affecting a highly conserved donor splice site and leading most probably to aberrant splicing. Various splicesite mutations in the FRAS1 have been described before. In the paternal DNA sample, copy number variation (CNV) analysis based on next generation sequencing data showeda novel heterozygous deletion of the last three exons of the FRAS1 gene. Junction fragment PCR con ï¬rmed this dele tion and sequencing of the PCR products revealed thebreakpoints (c.11092 +658_*12039 +6368del). Although the material of the ï¬rst abort had poor quality, Sanger sequencing and junction fragment PCR on frozen skin cellswere able to identify these two novel variants as compound heterozygous. Conclusion: Therefore, clinical exome sequencing in combination with CNV analysis on a couple âs DNA is an appropriate method to detect possible causes of multiple stillbirths, especially when no fetal DNA is available.

That child deceased at the age of one month. Chromosome analysis and microarray were normal in both malformed children. After termination of pregnancy we performed a clinical trio exome (Agilent SureSelect Inher ited Disease Panel). We identi ï¬ed two loss of function mutations in compound heterozygosity in the FTO gene not yet described (ACMG class 4). The deceased sibling carried both mutations and the healthy sister none. Homozygous FTO loss of function mutations have been associated with multiple malformations including short broad neck, differ ent brain malformations, severe developmental delay, failure to thrive and high risk of death in early childhood(Boissel 2009, Daoud 2016). In summary, the FTO mutations are very likely to be causative for the disease because of the type of mutation, the phenotype and thesegregation data. Nevertheless, prenatal molecular analysis should be accompanied by a detailed ultrasound work up. Moreover, the couple has to be aware that the absence of theFTO mutations does not completely exclude the disease. U. Siebers Renelt: None. Y. Stratis: None. J. SeggewiÃ: None. S. Ledig: None. J.

Ott Research Institute of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductology, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation Introduction: We report an unusual case of unbalanced karyotype female carrier with no physical and mental abnormalities and her reproductive history. Materials and Methods: Conventional karyotyping (GTG and QFH/AcD banding techniques) was performed on the chorionic villi from aborted material and on PHA stimulated lymphocytes of the patient, her husband and patient âs parents. FISH and aCGH (CGXv1.1 8x60K,Per kinElmer) were performed on the patient âs PHA stimulated lymphocytes and whole blood sample, respectively. Stan dard IVF was performed with an embryo biopsy on day 3 (6 8 cell stage) for PGT SR by FISH. Results: The patient 28 years old women sought genetic counseling after loss of two naturally conceived pregnancies. The ï¬rst miscarriage was not karyotyped. The second had karyotype 45, Ð¥Ð¥,der(8)t(8;18)(p23;p11.3), 18mat. The patient appeared to have the same karyotype: 45,Ð¥Ð¥,der(8)t(8;18)(p23;p11.3), 18dn. aCGH revealed terminal deletions combined with microduplication: del(8) (p23.1p23.3) (6.718Mb), dup(8)(p22p22) (4.937Mb), del1188(18)(p11.31p11.32) (3.693Mb), dup(18)(q23q23) (0.060Mb). The patient âs husband and parents had normal karyotypes. The patient had only slight dysmorphic face features and no pronounced physical and mental abnorm alities. Subsequently, the patient underwent four IVF cycles with a total of 25 oocytes obtained. Only 13 of themreached MII (52% versus expected 75 90%). Only one out of 10 embryos was cytogenetically balanced. The embryo was transferred, but the pregnancy was not registered. Conclusions: The present case demonstrates a genotype phenotype disparity in the carrier of unbalanced chromo somal rearrangement.

Offspring of mothers with GDM have an increased risk of birth complications associated with higher risk for developingmetabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovas cular disease in later life. To date, the only genome wideassociation study (GWAS) for GDM, in 1,399 affected Korean women, revealed associations at two loci: MNTR1B andCDKAL1 . We conducted trans ethnic meta analysis of 21 GWAS in 5,374 cases and 346,506 controls of diverse ancestry (62.0% European, 16.5% East Asian, 3.2% Mexican American and 18.3% Afro Caribbean), eachimputed up to reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project or Haplotype Reference Consortium. The trans ethnic meta analysis, performed with MR MEGA to allowfor heterogeneity in allelic effects between ancestries, included 13,980,490 variants, after excluding those with minor allele count <5 and imputation quality <0.4 in eachGWAS. We replicated both known GDM associations at genome wide signi ï¬cance ( P<5x10 8): MTNR1B (rs10830963, P,2.3Ã10 49)a n d CDKAL1 (rs9348441, P,9.7Ã10 15). We also identi ï¬ed three additional novel loci: TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P,1Ã10 14),CDKN2A/B (rs10811660, P,1.9Ã10 9) and LOC105369513 (rs143421658, P,4.1Ã10 8). Allelic effects of GDM association signals were mostly homogeneous across ethnic groups. The exception was at the CDKAL1 locus (Phet,3.68Ã10 9), where the signal was driven by East Asian ancestry GWAS (OR East asian,1.67(1.46 1.89); OR Europeans ,1.06(1.01 1.12)). Four of the loci ( MTNR1B , CDKAL1 ,TCF7L2 , and CDKN2A/B ) have also been robustly associated with T2D, and lead variants are identical to those we have identi ï¬ed for GDM, supporting a shared underlying genetic contribution to both diseases.

Aiming to achieve progress in elucidating genetic causes of male infertility and to examine suitability of novel genetic testing methods in clinical routine of infertile man, we investigated man with unexplained infertility with Array ComparativeGenomic Hybridisation method. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 90 patients with severe male factor infertility, de ï¬ned as idiopathic azoos permia or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, and analyzed DNA using SurePrint G3 Unrestricted CGH 4x180K microarrays. We have selected candidate Copy NumberVariants (CNVs) according 2 criterias: 1st criteria was that identi ï¬ed CNVs are not present in currently available databases of genomic variants, and 2nd criteria was thatidenti ï¬ed CNVs are not present in our control data set of men with proven fertility.

However, most patients remain undiag nosed. In this study, we explored the role of de novo copy number variations (CNVs) in whole exome sequencing(WES) data from a unique cohort of 108 infertile men and their parents. Material and Methods: Three different software, CoN IFER, XHMM and an optimized GATK4 pipeline were used to detect rare de novo CNVs. XHMM and GATK4 reduced the inherent noise in the exome coverage data best,resulting in the most accurate CNVs detection. Addition ally, the GATK4 pipeline allowed to integrate allele fre quency analysis, con ï¬rming the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in deletions. Results: Application of these tools revealed two rare de novo deletions in two different patients. One deletion occurred on chromosome 11 and partially overlapped a deletion previously reported in an infertile man. The second, affected NXT2 on chromosome X, a gene evolutionary conserved and highly expressed in testis. Both CNVs were validated by microarrays and/or Q PCR. Conclusions: These ï¬rst data indicates that de novo CNVs may play an important role in severe male infertility. However, replication and functional studies are required to further validate the impact of our ï¬ndings. By further improving CNV detection from WES data we may be also able to identify additional de novo CNVs that are currently missed, as well as maternally inherited CNVs that may playa role in male infertility.

Nonobstructive azoosper mia (NOA) is the most severe form of male infertility affecting ~0.6% of men from the general population and~10% of infertile men. Its etiology remains largely unknown. To identify the genetic cause of NOA in four affected members from a consanguineous family, weperformed whole exome sequencing (WES). WES revealed a homozygous c.1166C>T (p. Pro389Leu) variation in the M1AP gene. The segregation of the M1AP variant with NOA in this family was con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. The 3D structure of the mutant protein was predicted computationally. Sequence and structure based in silico studies and subsequent preliminary gene expression studies imply that the M1AP variant has severe implications for protein structure and function. Further functional studies tocorroborate our ï¬ndings are ongoing. Overall, M1AP is a novel candidate gene for male infertility and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ï¬rst report identifying M1AP as a cause for human familial NOA. And our pedigree analysis suggests an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for NOA due to M1AP in the present family. S. G. Temel: None. B. TurkgenÃ§: None. K. Teral Ä±: None. M. ErgÃ¶ren: None.

The most common form of the latter phenotype is non obstructive azoospermia (NOA), which can be caused by various genetic defects such as chromosomal aberrations,Y chromosomal AZF microdeletions or monogenic defects. In this study, we systematically analysed 24 genes reported to be associated with NOA in the OMIM database. Variantsin these genes were detected in whole exome sequencing data from 484 well phenotyped infertile patients (azoos permia, N ,94; cryptozoospermia, N ,52; mixed atrophy, N,93; Sertoli Cell Only syndrome, N ,179; meiotic arrest, N,43; other arrest, N ,23). Other clinical causes for their infertility such as previous chemo /radiotherapy, as well askaryotype aberrations and AZF deletions had been excluded. Exclusively novel or rare coding variants were assessed concerning their potential pathogenicity. Out of the24 genes listed in OMIM, TEX14, TEX11, NR5A1 and DMRT1 were validated as clinically relevant genes causing NOA with strong evidence. Speci ï¬cally, we identi ï¬ed eight patients carrying TEX11 variants. Ten patients demonstrated compound heterozygous or homozygous TEX14 variants. Five patients carried NR5A1 and ï¬ve others DMRT1 variants. This is the ï¬rst report of concise exome sequencing in a large group of infertile males.

SNP based NIPS can distin guish the maternal and fetal SNP allele distributions. Thisstudy validates the performance of SNP based NIPS to detect maternal CA on chromosome X. Methods: Plasma samples from singleton pregnancies were obtained (April December 2018) and analyzed by SNP based NIPS. Samples were included in the analysis if the algorithm could not return a result (below threshold forreporting) for suspected CA. These samples were strati ï¬ed into suspected maternal (group A, n ,107) and fetal origin(group B, n ,110). Associated maternal buffy coats were blinded and sent to CHOP for cytogenetic analysis using the Global Screening Array (GSA, Illumina). Results: Of 107 group A samples, 101 were con ï¬rmed by GSA to have maternal X CA (PPV: 94.4%; 97.5% con ï¬dence interval (CI), 88.2 100%); in the remaining 6 sam ples, 3 were discordant (GSA unable to detect suspected maternal CA), and in the other 3 samples, maternal CA was suspected, but too ambiguous to call as present. In 67.3%(68/101) cases, NIPS vs. GSA interpretations matched; and 32.7% (33/101) showed similar but varied interpretations due to ambiguities arising from mosaicism and/or speci ï¬cX abnormality. No maternal X CA were found in group B by GSA (NPV: 100%; 97.5% CI, 96.7 100%). Conclusions: The study supports the reporting of maternal X CA suspected by SNP based NIPS, which was conï¬rmed in 94.4% of suspected cases.

Materials and Methods: To understand the biology of HRT use, we carried out genome wide analyses of self reported HRT phenotypes (ever taken, age started, age stopped and time taken) in up to 153,152 white Europeanwomen aged 40 70 years from the UK Biobank. Results: We identi ï¬ed 15 independent signals. A signal (AF,95%) in TACR3 , the receptor for neurokinin B, was associated with raised odds of using HRT (1.18 per allele; P,1Ã10 26) and with vasomotor symptoms in a previous genome wide analysis (Crandall et al 2017). Additionally, aputative signal (AF ,0.1%) near ALDH8A1 (gene involved in tryptophan catabolism) was associated with taking HRT for longer (0.5 SD per allele; P,4Ã10 8). Tryptophan is a precursor of serotonin, which has been implicated in hot ï¬ushes, as has neurokinin B. Of the signals, 13/15 were associated with starting HRT younger at P<5Ã10 8and 11 with earlier menopause. A genetically predicted one year earlier menopause raised the odds of HRT use in women starting treatment before 2002(OR,1.12, 95% CI ,1.10,1.13) but not after 2002 (OR,1.02, 95% CI ,0.95,1.00). In contrast, the signals near TACR3 and ALDH8A1 were not associated with menopause timing. Conclusions: Genetic associations for HRT are largely driven by menopause timing and are affected by changes inhealth practice. We identi ï¬ed two genetic signals, which are not affected by health practice, near plausible candidate genes for vasomotor symptoms. K. S. Ruth: None. R. N. Beaumont: None. J. Tyrrell: None. A. R.

Materials and Methods: Molecular karyotype was applied on 4012 prenatal samples (CVS, amniotic ï¬uids) as theï¬rst line diagnostic tool. Specimens have been analyzed using Agilent SurePrint G3 8x60K ISCA design and Cytogenomics software. Results: women who underwent prenatal molecular kar yotype were referred for ultrasound ï¬ndings, increased NT,advanced maternal age, previous pregnancy with aneu ploidy, positive biochemical or NIPT, anxiety etc. Molecular karyotype shows an increased diagnostic yield compared to conventional karyotype varying from 1,4% to 3,4% depending on the referral reason with the highest added value in fetuses with abnormal U/S ï¬ndings. Among all abnormal CGH samples with normal karyotype, 72,5% of clinically signi ï¬cant imbalances would have escaped detection from NIPT since they concern rare syndromes(25%), susceptibility to loci (60%) and backbone abnorm alities (15%) related to the referral reason. Conclusion: Since more than 70% of the abnormal CGH cases would not be detected neither by conventional kar yotype nor by NIPT, we suggest that every pregnant woman of any age should be offered the informed choice to undergomolecular karyotype prenatal testing.

Disease transmission to offspring can be avoided through prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT M). We describe arobust PGT M strategy that can be applied to virtually any couple at risk for DM1, including carriers of large expanded alleles with non CTG interruptions at either the 5 âor 3âend of the repeat. This strategy utilizes whole genome ampli ï¬cation by multiple displacement ampli ï¬cation, followed by bidirectional triplet primed PCR (TP PCR) sizing of theDMPK CTG repeat, in parallel with single tube genotyping and haplotype phasing of 12 closely linked and highlypolymorphic microsatellite markers. Bidirectional TP PCR and dodecaplex marker PCR assays were optimized and validated on whole genome ampli ï¬ed single lymphoblasts isolated from DM1 reference cell lines, and tested on a simulated PGT M case comprising a parent offspring trio and three simulated embryos. DMPK TP PCR reliably detects repeat expansions regardless of allele size, and employing TP PCR in both directions ensures successful expansion detection even when non CTG interruptionsoccur at either the 5 âor 3 âend of the expanded allele. Misdiagnoses and diagnostic ambiguity due to allele dropout or exogenous DNA contamination can be easilydetected through the use of tightly linked microsatellite markers, minimizing the exclusion of potentially unaffected embryos for uterine transfer. The highly polymorphic multi marker panel also maximizes the likelihood of marker informativeness in at risk couples, thus minimizing the need for couple speci ï¬c assay customization. M.

The effects of resveratrol on expression levels of these genes in human amniotic cellcultures, which are treated by nicotine were also examined in this study. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients were included in our study and for each patient; control, nicotine treated and nicotine +resveratrol treated cell culture groups are formed. The expression levels of SOX2 and SOX4 genesare examined in each group by using real time RT PCR. Results: According to the results of our study, change in expression levels of SOX2 and SOX4 genes in nicotinetreated group were found to be statistically signi ï¬cant. Also, when groups treated with nicotine and nicotine +resvera trol were compared the difference was found to be statisti cally signi ï¬cant. Conclusion: In conclusion, nicotine increased the expression levels of SOX2 and SOX4 genes by 60% inhuman amniotic cell cultures and resveratrol was found to be an important antioxidant that reduces the increased expression levels of SOX2 and SOX4 genes caused bynicotine treatment.1194This study was supported by the Scienti ï¬c Research Project Unit of the Ãukurova University G.

The 38 year old woman underwent amniocentesis because of a high risk of trisomy2 revealed by the Non Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT). Methods and results: A genome wide NIPT detected a trisomy of chromosome 2. The amniocentesis was per formed to verify the NIPT result. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) from uncultured amniocytes revealed a duplication of 14,83 Mb on chromosome2q11.1q13. Interphase ï¬uorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed three signals of centromere 2 in 30% of the cells. GTG banded metaphases con ï¬rmed the abnormal karyotype (47,XX, +mar[21]/46,XX[19]), indicating 52% mosaicism of the cell line with the sSMC. The ultrasound examination did not reveal abnormalities. The pregnancyhas been terminated. Cytogenetic analyses (FISH, aCGH and conventional karyotype) on fetal skin biopsies were performed and con ï¬rmed the genomic gain of the cen tromeric region of chromosome 2. In the placenta, three cell lines were detected: a normal cell line, a cell line with trisomy 2 and a third one with only the sSCM derived fromchromosome 2. Conclusion: Whole genome NIPT allows not only the identi ï¬cation of common fetal trisomies (13, 18, 21) but also diagnosis of rare chromosomal abnormal ities. Especially in such cases, it is extremely important to perform not only NIPT veri ï¬cation on a sample of material other than trophoblast, but also to apply appropriateresearch methods.

Unbalancedchromosomal rearrangements may also interfere with NIPT. We report here a rare anomaly identi ï¬ed through NIPT. Case: A NIPT was performed on a 39 year old woman with abnormal ï¬rst trimester serum markers. This NIPT (Clarigo, Multiplicom Agilent ) did not show any trisomy 21 but was evocative of trisomy 18. An amniocentesis wasperformed at the 22th week of gestation (WG) and FISH analyses ( Aneucyte, Cytocell) on native amniotic ï¬uid were compatible with a trisomy 18 in a female fetus. Unexpect edly, concomitant ultrasound control didn ât detect any morphological abnormality on a male fetus. Then, fetal karyotype and array CGH con ï¬rmed the female chromo somal sex and revealed a very partial trisomy 18, linked to a small supernumerary marker chromosome, in mosaic, which was derivative from a chromosome 18. In addition,SRY locus was found on the short arm of one X chromo some. Genetic counseling being less alarming in this con text than with a complete trisomy 18, this patient pursuedher pregnancy and delivered a boy at 36 WG with normal neonatal examination.

NIPT using cell free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in maternalblood presents as an early, accurate, and safe prenatal testing. Since August 2018 NIPT for chromosomes 21, 18, 13 and sex determination was introduced in situ in theUniversity Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology âMaichin domâ,S oï¬a. The analysis was discussed with pregnant women after performing cFTS. Materials and Methods: A total of 134 pregnant women were screened for chromosomal aneuploidies by NIPT using ion semiconductor sequencing platform (Ion Pro tonâ¢, Thermo Fisher Scienti ï¬c) and IONA Â®test (Pre maitha Health plc, Manchester, UK). The patients were at a mean age of 34.5 years. Plasma samples were collectedbetween 10 +5 and 24 +5 g.w. Results: Due to an intermediate risk (1/100 to 1/1000) NIPT was performed on 68 (47.76%) pregnant women. Others were tested because of maternal anxiety or advanced age. An average of 10.6% (from 3 to 24%) fetal fraction (FF) was achieved. One report was unsuccessful due to alow fetal fraction in patient with BMI ,43.03. We obtained 132âlow risk âreports and one âhigh risk â for trisomy 21, conï¬rmed by amniocentesis followed by QF PCR. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst introduction of locally performed NIPT in Bulgaria. With the accumulation of more samples and data a possible correlation between cFTS results and NIPT; FF or/and gestational week and NIPT results could be established. R. Raynova: None. S.

Srebniak1 1Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands,2Amphia Hospital, Breda, Netherlands,3Reinier de Graaf Hospital, Delft, Netherlands Objective: Nonâinvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) detects placental chromosome aberrations. When amniocentesisreveals a normal karyotype, con ï¬ned placental mosaicism (CPM) may be assumed. In order to con ï¬rm this, placental cytogenetic studies were performed. Method: NIPT was conducted in the course of the DutchTRIDENT study. Placentas of 10 cases with NIPT results indicating an autosomal trisomy and showing anormal (N ,9) or low mosaic karyotype (N ,1) in amniotic ï¬uid (AF) were investigated. The cytotrophoblast as well as the mesenchymal core of two to four placentalchorionicvilli biopsies were studied with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Clinical outcome data were collected. Results: In 10/10 cases, CPM was proven. In 3/10 cases trisomy/uniparental disomy (UPD)/biparental disomy (BPD) mosaicism was discovered. In 2/3 cases, all three celllines were present in the placenta, whereas BPD was found in AF. In 1/3 cases trisomy 22/UPD22 was present in AF while trisomy 22/BPD22 mosaicism was found in the pla centa. Five of 10 pregnancies were affected with pre â eclampsia, low birth weight, preterm delivery, and/or con genital malformations. Conclusion: The presence of trisomy/UPD/BPD mosai cism in 3/10 cases that we investigated proves that trisomic zygote rescue may involve multiple rescue events duringearly embryogenesis. UPD mosaicism, when present in crucial fetal tissues, may explain the abnormal phenotype in undiagnosed cases. D. Van Opstal: None. K. E.M. Diderich: None. M. Joosten: None. L. C.P. Govaerts: None.

The objective of this study is to give a complete and robust clinical picture of the current performance of NIPT for trisomy 13, 18, and 21 andsex chromosomes aneuploidies as well as for the other chromosomes. Materials and Methods: All data were generated in our AMES accredited laboratory from January 2017 to January 2019 in 20000 samples. The pipeline included automated library preparation (VeriSeq NIPT Microlab STAR, Illu mina) and WGS sequencing on a Next550 (Illumina). VeriSeq NIPT Assay Software ( www.illumina.com/ NIPTsoftware ) was used for data analysis of aneuploidy status of 13, 18, 21, X and Y chromosomes and fetal fraction of cffDNA. An in house algorithm was optimized to analyze other aneuploidies and subchromosomalaberrations. Results: The main results were showed in Table 1. We also reported 19 rare autosomal trisomies (RATs) and6 structural abnormalities identi ï¬ed in 10500 samples, mainly trisomy 15 (n ,5), followed by trisomy 8 (n ,4) and trisomies 16 and 22 (n ,2).

We show that low FF can also be associated with high DNA concentration (DC) which frequently reverts toward average after redraw. Materials and Methods: Sample DC was estimated by comparing to a reference sequence added before ampli ï¬ cation. 99,936 eligible samples were collected between2012 and 2014. Additionally, 1,374 received a redraw after test failure and changes in DC and FF between the two draws were observed. Results: Samples with low DC (below 10th percentile) have average FF 12.4% and samples with high DC (aboveAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 119790th percentile) have average FF 8.6%. The average FF is 10.1%. Samples with test failure were twice as likely to have high DC. After redraw, cases with high initial DC had 38 times larger median reduction in DC compared to overall. The 10% of cases with greatest reduction in DC had median FF increase 1.2%, compared to FF increase 0.4%for cases without signi ï¬cant change in DC. Change in DC was a signi ï¬cant parameter (p<10 5) in a logistic regression model for redraw success. Conclusions: Samples with high DC are overrepresented in test failures and have lower average FF. High DC tends to reduce after redraw, producing larger FF increase. Thissupports the option for repeat NIPT after a failure due to low FF. [1] Pergament et al. Obstet Gynecol. 2014 Aug;124(2 Pt 1):210 8. [2] McKanna et al.

The proposed statement recommended to refer allpregnancies with oligohydramnios to genetic counseling, except for proven rupture of membranes, evidence of placental insuf ï¬ciency or oligohydramnios diagnosed after 37 weeks of gestational age. Thus, the objective of this study was to explore the risk for abnormal chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) ï¬ndings in pregnancies with oligohydramnios. Methods: Data from all CMA analyses performed due to oligohydramnios between January 2013 and September2017 were retrospectively obtained from the Ministry of Health database. In addition, a search was conducted through the Pubmed database from inception to February2018 for English articles exploring the issue. Results: Fifty CMA analyses were performed due to oligohydramnios. Of these, in 21 tests it constituted an isolated anomaly, 13 cases were associated with anatomic defects, and the remaining 16 pregnancies were diagnosed with intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR) as well. All CMA tests were normal, except for one pathogenic ï¬nding in the IUGR group a 16p11.2 duplication sized 722Kb. Literature search yielded 394 titles, of which two relevant articles were found. One of these, published at 1998, yiel ded 31 (20.1%) abnormal karyotypes in 154 pregnancies with oligohydramnios (11 of these as an isolated ï¬ndings), while another (1995) did not ï¬nd any aberrations in 28 pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios.

A large study of more than 15000 trophectodermbiopsies found the lowest rate of aneuploidy to be 25% in young women increasing with maternal age to more than 90%. Thus at least 1 in 4 embryos are expected to beaneuploid, possibly leading to implantation failure, mis carriage or an abnormal fetus. Hence, selection of euploid embryos should in theory increase pregnancy rates anddecrease miscarriage rates, but this is still a subject of intense international discussion. In our center we don ât offer PGT A, but as our PGT SR setup is based on ShallowWhole Genome Sequencing, the ploidy status is revealed, and thus used for prioritizing embryos. Our PGT M setup includes fragment analysis of short tandem repeats, andSNaPshot analysis of the speci ï¬c mutation when relevant. Since PGT M setup does not detect aneuploidy, we would expect a higher rate of implantation when performing PGT SR. Mean maternal age is similar in the two groups (30.96 in the PGT M and 32.56 in the PGT SR group). We1198examined the rate of positive hCG and ongoing pregnancies (OPR) per transfer (SET) on embryos (159 PGT M and 27 PGT SR) transferred between 01 01 2017 and 01 12 2018. Surprisingly, we found no signi ï¬cant difference in outcome in the two groups in terms of positive hCG (49.7 vs. 48.1, P ,0.881) or OPR (34.6 vs. 37.0, P ,0.805), but the number of cases is still rather low.

30104,"Natera, Inc., San Carlos, CA, United States Introduction: Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) and noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can determine fetal sex with high accuracy prior to/during pregnancy. However,additional prenatal screening or clinical presentation may indicate sex discrepancy requiring medical follow up for an infant âs health. Methods: Cases of possible sex discrepancy after PGT or NIPT at a single lab were retrospectively reviewed. For PGT, genotyping was performed using Illumina Cyto12SNP based microarray with informatics. For NIPT, cell free DNA was isolated and ampli ï¬ed by massively multiplexed PCR targeting 13,392 SNPs covering chromosomes 13, 18,21, X and Y. Only cases with testing to identify a cause for discrepancy were included. Results: Four of 23,297 (0.02%) PGT and 49 of 1,081,541 (0.005%) NIPT cases had discrepant sex by prenatal screening or postnatal exam. For PGT, child con cordance with parental samples and remaining embryosrevealed 2 (50%) resulted from incorrect embryo transfers and 2 (50%) resulted from natural conception around the time of embryo transfer. For NIPT, phlebotomy labelingerrors comprised 6 (12.2%); con ï¬ned placental mosaicism, 10 (20.4%); ultrasound errors, 13 (26.6%); and disorders of sexual development (DSD), 20 (40.8%). No discrepancieswere due to lab error for PGT/NIPT cases. Conclusions: Causes of discordant sex after PGT or NIPT can include sample swap, ultrasound errors, PGT/NIPT result errors, natural conception around the time of embryo transfer, vanished twin on non SNP based NIPT, embryo mosaicism, con ï¬ned placental mosaicism and var ious DSDs.

PGT M is technically challenging, becauseof extremely small amount of biomaterial. We report here our experience of PGT M in âGenetico âcenter in Russia. Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of all requests and cycles of PGT M referred to our center was performed. Personalized PGT M assays combine direct diagnosis of the pathogenic variants and linkage analysis ofhighly heterozygous STRs. PGT A by NGS or aCGH was performed for unaffected embryos upon patient âs request. Results: Of 109 couples referred to our center for PGT M, 92 completed preliminary test for PGT M for 42 genetic condition: 24 autosomal dominant, 54 autosomal recessive, 13 X linked requests. The most frequent indication was spinalmuscular atrophy (17). We performed 85 PGT M cycles with 413 embryos. The whole genome ampli ï¬c a t i o nf a i l e di n1 6 cases (3,9%).

30106,"Introduction: microRNAs drive coordinated expressional changes of their target genes and trigger functional shift incells. Placental microRNAs are speci ï¬cally involved in trophoblast differentiation and function. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with the expression level of genesare de ï¬ned as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The aim of my PhD project is to identify placental eQTLs modulating the expression of microRNAs and to understandtheir downstream effect on the placental transcriptome. Materials and Methods: Placental miRSeq (unpubl. data) and genotyping (Kasak et al 2015) datasets weresubjected to genetic association testing for eQTL discovery (n,40), implicated in PLINK v1.07 (Purcell et al 2007). microRNAs and their eQTLs were cross referenced withnewbors growth parameters. Additionally association test ing between identi ï¬ed miRNA eQTLs and placental expression levels of predicted target genes were analyzed. Correlations between the expression pro ï¬le of placental miRNAs (miRSeq dataset) and transcripts (RNA Seq dataset; SÃµber et al 2015) were analyzed using DESeq2platform (Love et al 2014). eQTL and newborn growth parameter association was validated in combined REPRO META and Happy Pregnancy cohort (n ,2100) Results: In total, 11 placental microRNAs were detected that were expressionally modulated by eQTLs. Four of these microRNAs and their eQTLs show assosiation withnewborns growth parametes. Several novel target genes and biological pathways were identi ï¬ed for these microRNAs. Conclusions: miRNA eQTLs may represent additional modulators of the placental transcriptome, placental func tion and pregnancy course.

Paulussen1 1Maastricht University Medical Centre +, Maastricht, Netherlands,2Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands Introduction: consanguineous partners are at increased risk of both being carrier of the same autosomal recessive (AR) disorder, with 25% risk of affected offspring as aconsequence. Until recently, no comprehensive preconcep tion carrier test was available to identify the very rare disease causing mutations these couples may carry. Wedeveloped such a test for consanguineous couples and implemented this in our clinical practice. Materials and Methods: both individuals of a couple undergo whole exome sequencing (WES). First the couple âs sequence data are merged: only variants present in the same gene in both of them and with a population frequency <5%,remain in the dataset. Subsequently, this dataset is ï¬ltered against a gene panel, consisting of >1900 genes associated with known AR diseases (OMIM based). Only combina tions of likely pathogenic or pathogenic mutations (class IV or V variants) in both partners are reported. Carriership in only one individual is not detected. Results: thus far 22 consanguineous couples were included. For 7 (32%), âunexpected âpathogenic variants were reported conferring risk of severely affected offspring, allowing thesecouples to opt for prenatal or preconception diagnostic choi ces. Disease examples are: sul ï¬te oxidase de ï¬ciency, AR epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica, restrictive dermatopathy,infantile epileptic encephalopathy. None of the disease asso ciations were linked to any known disease in the family, demonstrating the innovative value of this approach. Conclusions: our WES based preconception carrier test (PCT) provides a powerful diagnostic tool for identi ï¬cation of serious disease carrier status in consanguineous couples. Outcomes provide signi ï¬cant reproductive choices that no other test currently offers. S. C.E. H. Sallevelt: None. B. de Koning: None. C. E.M. de Die Smulders: None. C. Gilissen: None. A. P.A.

Stejskal Gennet, Clinic of genetics and reproductive medicine, Prague, Czech Republic We have developed a NGS panel which screens (i) 889 mutations causing 68 severe genetic disorders that can affect progeny of healthy individuals (genetic compatibility test), (ii) mutations associated with blood hypercoagul ability in ï¬uencing infertility treatment and pregnancy, (iii) inherited ovarian response to gonadotrophin stimulation. The test is designated for patients undergoing an IVFprogram and for gamete donors. CarrierTest is a custom NGS panel with locally assem bled bioinformatic pipeline and variant database. To replaceMLPA and fragmentation analysis we implemented speci ï¬c design adjustments and sequencing data analysis allowing detection of large deletions of SMN1, CFTR genes and also microdeletions on chromosome Y (AZF region) within one laboratory test. The report contains comparative analysis of detected variants for evaluation of residual risk and pre conception compatibility of couple for consideration of preimplantation (PGT M) or prenatal diagnostics. So far 8258 samples were analyzed. These include: 3196 couples before conception, 1388 gamete donors and 478 patients with reproduction impairment without compat ibility testing. Frequent occurrence of carriers was observedin the commonly screened genes ( SMN1 2,4%, CFTR 3,7%, GJB2 6,2% ) but also in other genes previously not tested (e.g. ABCA4 4,2%, DHCR7 2,7%, SERPINA1 2,7%, PAH 2,5%, ACADM 1,5%, ATP7B 1,2%, AR1,1%). We identi ï¬ed 79 pairs (2,4%) with a reproduction risk, which is twofold increase detection rate in comparison with onlyCFTR/SMN1/GJB2 testing. CarrierTest facilitates informed decision about reproduc tion. Screening of couples and gamete donors allows to elu cidate higher number of carriers of severe disorders in order to offer appropriate preconception and prenatal care. F. Lhota: A.

Altarescu1 1Medical Genetics Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center,, Jerusalem, Israel,2IVF Unit, Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel The introduction of new technologies of chromosomal microarrays (CMA) and whole exome sequencing is leadingto wider awareness of people to their genetic background and in ï¬uence on offspring. The decision to perform PGD to select an embryo with no inherited VUS, considering theinherent ambiguity of VUS which is not unequivocally linked to a disorder, may give false hope and lead to frustration if an affected child is born. In order to evaluateIsraeli VUS carriers âintentions regarding PGD for VUS ï¬ndings, we have analyzed database from a large PGD center. Twenty three couples required PGD for VUSdetected, in at least one spouse, by CMA analysis. Five couples had two VUS detected. Eight couples (35%) had previous pregnancy termination (TOP) solely due to thedetection of VUS in an embryo. Thirteen couples (57%) had no other indication for PGD. The interpretation of VUS in the time of counseling was âlikely pathogenic âin 10 cases (36%), âVUS âin 9 cases (32%) and âlikely benign âin 9 cases (32%). PGD was performed in 14 couples (61%): 9/ 10 likely pathogenic, 5/9 VUS and 1/9 likely benign VUS. Although most couples performed PGD for a likely pathogenic VUS, some couples regard likely benign VUS as an indication for TOP and PGD. Future demand for suchcontroversial PGD applications will be growing and challenge the medical milieu also considering continuous re interpretation of VUS. Setting guidelines for VUS â interpretations, proper counselling regarding VUS âmean ings and de ï¬ning the justi ï¬ed applications of PGD uses are crucial steps in practicing PGD for VUS ï¬ndings.

Thepurpose of our study is to show the value of PGT in couples with infertility; its ability to reduce the risk of birth of chromosomally unbalanced offspring and pregnancy loss;to increase the chance of successful pregnancy and birth of an unaffected child. Materials and Methods: We describe 185 couples with a history of infertility and pregnancy loss, who after extensive genetic counseling opted for in vitro fertilization procedure with PGT. Trophectoderm biopsy was carried out on 497blastocyst stage embryos originating from 231 oocyte retrieval cycles. DNA was extracted and subjected to whole genome ampli ï¬cation. Array based comparative genomic hybridization with microarray platforms 24sure v3/24sure + and next generation sequencing with VeriSeqPGS Librar yPrep protocol were performed. Results were analyzed byBlueFuse Multi version 4.3 software. Results: 196 embryos had a balanced pro ï¬le (39.44%), 292 embryos showed an unbalanced pro ï¬le (58.75%) and 9 embryos could not be interpreted (1.81%). Embryo transfer was conducted in 109 cases (58.92%) and chemical preg nancy was detected in 33.03% of the women. Pregnancyloss occurred in 3.67% of cases. Live birth rate was 29.36%. Conclusions: PGT reduces the number of failed transfers and eliminates the trauma of terminating desired pregnancyand possible medical complications. In couples with reproductive failures, PGT can be recommended in order to considerably increase the chance of conceiving with achromosomally balanced embryo and live birth of a healthy offspring. S.

Due to this impact, rWES has become a routine genetic test in this group of patients. We hypothesize that rWES could have the same effect evenbefore birth. Therefore we studied the use of rWES in fetuses with a wide range of sonographic anomalies representing the clinical practice. We performed a retrospective analysis of the ï¬rst 54 cases referred to our laboratory for prenatal rWES following the detection of fetal sonographic anomalies. Parental and fetalDNAs were sequenced simultaneously in 53 of the cases and as singleton analysis in one case due to a deceased parent. The most common identi ï¬ed sonographic anomalies were (multiple) congenital anomalies, skeletal dysplasia and intracerebral structural anomalies. We were able to identify a causative pathogenic mole cular variant in 12 of the 54 cases (22%) and a likely causative pathogenic molecular variant in another ï¬ve cases (9%), bringing the molecular diagnostic yield in thiscohort to 31%. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variantswere detected in fetuses w ith skeletal dysplasias ( n,11, 65%), multiple congenital anomalies ( n,4, 23%) or intracerebral structural anomalies ( n,2, 12%).

30111,"Mother and Child, Moscow, Russian FederationOver 5 years the strategy of genetic counseling signi ï¬ cantly has changed after introduction of new prenataldiagnostic methods of detecti on chromosomal abnormal ities. In 2013 our laboratory had possibility to use cell based FISH and karyotyping for pregnancies at risk(maternal serum screening, advanced age, ultrasound examination (US), family history, patient âs anxiety). Since 2014 patients in ï¬rst trimester with NT> ,2,5 mm or/and US abnormalities were recommended chorionic villus sampling followed by karyotyping and DNA extraction which allowed to perform aCGH (array basedcomparative genomic hybridization) in case of normal fetus karyotype. In second trimester after the amniocent esis mostly aCGH/FISH analy sis were recommended due to time limit with compare to cell cultivation of amniotic ï¬uid for standard karyotyping . Chromosome imbalances by aCGH let us reveal about 20 families where one of theparents had a balanced rearrangement invisible by standard karyotyping. For these aims subtelomeric FISH analysis have been performed. When a noninvasiveprenatal testing (NIPT) appeared in 2016 the whole amount of invasive procedures decreased up to 50%. NIPT should be recommended to women without USabnormalities and family history (Table). Otherwise only invasive prenatal testing is acceptable due to limits of NIPT. Since 2013 more than 12000 prenatal analyseswere done. aCGH increased the detection of pathogenic chromosomal aberrations on 12%.

The most common are trisomies of chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and monosomy of the chromosome X. Noninvasive prenatal screening tests allow the risk calcula tion of the aneuploidies based on the patients age (above 35), biochemical markers (free Î² hCG) and ultrasono graphic markers (nuchal translucency parameter). Theresults suggesting a high risk of aneuploidy give strong indications for further invasive diagnostics. The aim of this project was to evaluate the frequency of chromosome aberrations other than aneuploidies in the group of 204 patients with high risk of trisomy based on the screening tests, where the ultrasound test did not show anyabnormalities. To perform the array diagnostic evaluation DNA from uncultured amniotic ï¬uid, trophoblast or cul tured amniocytes was used. Aneuploidy was identi ï¬ed in 34/204 fetuses (17%). Trisomy 21 was the most frequent abnormality (66%). The trisomy 13 and 18 were detected in 3% and 11%, respec tively, followed by X monosomy (11%), X mosaic monosomy (3%) and sex chromosomes disomy (11%). In 10/204 cases (5%) structural aberrations of 115 kb to 41 Mbwere identi ï¬ed. Two of them were classi ï¬ed as potentially pathogenic and 8 as pathogenic, where 4 were localized in1204the regions of known microdeletion and microduplication syndromes.

We report on a 17 weeks male fetus with anultrasonographic suspicion of Dandy Walker Malformation (DWM) recurrence. The previous pregnancy of the couple had been interrupted at 22 gestational weeks following adiagnosis of DWM. We identi ï¬ed the molecular cause using Next Generation Sequencing in prenatal diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been performed on fetal genomic DNA. After reads pre processing, mapping, variant calling and annota tion, a ï¬ltering strategy based on allelic frequency, recessive inheritance and phenotypic ontologies has been applied. A fetal MRI at 18 gestational weeks has been performed. In silico analysis of a potential causative variant in the Fukutinprotein has been carried out through a structural modeling approach. Results: We identi ï¬ed a novel homozygous missense mutation (NM_006731.2, c.898G>A, p. Gly300Arg) in Fukutin gene ( FKTN ), which is associated to Muscular Dystrophy Dystroglycanopathies. Fetal MRI supported molecular ï¬ndings. Structural modeling analyses indicated a potential pathogenetic mechanism of the variant, througha reduced activation of the sugar moieties, which in turn impairs transfer to Î± dystroglycan and thus its glycosyla tion.

The most abundant diseases are Noonan syndrome and neuro ï¬bromatosis type 1. Materials and Methods: Resequencing of 20 selected genes was performed by massive parallel sequencing approach on samples with normal karyotype originatedfrom amniotic ï¬uid or chorionic villi tissue. Results: Samples were indicated on the basis of ultra sound ï¬ndings. From a total of 104 prenatal samples cau sative variant was found in 10 of them (detection rate 9,6 %). All those positive samples had severe ultrasoundï¬nding âincreased nuchal translucency, hygroma coli, cardiac abnormalities, excess amniotic ï¬uid, etc. Most fre quently causative variants were found in PTPN11 gene (4/ 10). Surprisingly, in two cases (2/10) we have detected variant in RIT1 , one of the recently reported gene for Noonan syndrome. Especially in prenatal diagnostic var iants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VOUS) pose a signi ï¬cant problem. There is not enough information to sort them out into classi ï¬catory categories, so they complicate con secutive genetic consultation. In our group VOUS was identi ï¬ed in 14 samples (14/104; 13,5 %). However, seg regation analysis of the variants in family members helpedto clarify their signi ï¬cance in eight of them.

The goal of the present study is to show the results of the implementation of a reduced carrier screening test analyzed by NGS in a population of1097 healthy individuals who attend a reproduction center. This test includes 15 genes associated with the 16 most prevalent autosomal recessive and X âlinked diseases in Caucasian population, following the current recommenda tions of scienti ï¬c societies (high prevalence, severe, early onset and with clear genotype phenotype relation diseases).Among the total of individuals, 809 (73.7%) are women and 288 (26.3%) are men. 25.4% are carriers of at least 1 pathogenic or probably pathogenic alteration (22.5% have asingle mutation and 2.9% have two). Diseases with highest probability of being a carrier are: cystic ï¬brosis and1206congenital bilateral aplasia of vas deferens (1/13), GJB2 related DFNB 1 non syndromic hearing loss and deafness (1/16), familial Mediterranean fever (1/42), spinal muscular atrophy (1/50) and phenylketonuria (1/52). Out of the 809 women, 2.1% are carriers of a premutation (45 200 CGG repeats) in the FMR1 gene, causative of X fragile syndrome. In conclusion, 1 out 4 patients without other diseases who attend a reproduction center is a carrier of a pathogenic alteration in one of the screened genes. This testidenti ï¬es the most frequent alterations that are at risk of being transmitted to the offspring to promote the autonomy of patients to make reproductive decisions. M. SÃ¡nchez Soler: None.

Approximately 40%of patients have a heritable form of the disease, caused by a mutation in RB1. Offspring of these individuals are at a 50% risk of inheriting the disease. Aggressive and invasivetreatments in the ï¬rstï¬ve years of life under general anaesthetic, followed by regular monitoring until age 18, impact the patient, family, hospital resources. Preimplanta tion genetic diagnosis (PGD) offers alternative reproductive choices for individuals with a heritable mutation. Costs of genomic sequencing are rapidly declining, with increasingavailability of reproductive technologies. Methods and Materials: We undertook a cost effectiveness study of access to PGD for survivors withheritable retinoblastoma. We modelled the cost of repro ductive technology, number of affected/unaffected births,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1207and quality of life gains, for parental uptake rates of PGD from 0 100%. We included the costs of hospital visits from 0 18 years, and costs of IVF and PGD using three cycles (1 fresh, 2 frozen). Results: In a cohort of retinoblastoma survivors, using in vitro fertilization (IVF) and PGD always led to cost savings,and quality of life improvements, even at low uptake rates. Cost savings were $156,538 and 20.58 Quality Adjusted Life years were gained for ten couples with 50% using PGDcompared to the natural pregnancy pathway. Conclusions: IVF and PGD were always less expensive, with higher quality of life compared with taking the naturalpregnancy approach.

It is known that susceptibility to CD is linked to certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles, especially in the HLA DQregion. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the CD predisposing alleles in women with RPL. Results: The presence of appropriate HLA alleles in 32 women with RPL and 33 women of control group was determined. High CD predisposition was considered inindividuals with HLA alleles DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201 0203 (encoding HLA DQ2) and DQB1*0302 (encoding HLA DQ8), the presence of only the alleles DQA1*0501,DQB1*0201 0203 was considered as medium high predis position CD and a low risk CD are related allele DQB1*0302. A signi ï¬cantly higher frequency HLA DQ2/ DQ8 haplotype in women with RPL compared to control was established (21.88% vs. 3.03%, p<0.025). The geno type HLA DQ2 is established with a signi ï¬cantly higher frequency in women with RPL compared to control (34.8% vs. 6.06%, p <0.005). The frequency of the HLA DQ8genotype was almost the same in the study groups (18.75% and 12.12%, p>0.05), and the absence of such CD predisposing alleles was signi ï¬cantly lower in women with RPL compared to control (25% and 78.79%, p <0.0001). Conclusions: The study of a possible correlation between HLA DQ2/DQ8 haplotype and RPL might suggest new diagnostic and therapeutical approaches for RPL women. K. Sosnina: None. O. Terpyliak: None.

30121,"United Kingdom Introduction: NIPD where the mother carries a mutation is hindered by the maternal mutant background in cell free DNA (cfDNA). Relative haplotype dosage analysis is used in clinical laboratories for NIPD of recessive and X linked disorders, however this technique requires DNA from both parents and a proband. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) offers high sensitivity for quanti ï¬cation of cfDNA and has potential for use in carrier mothers via relative mutation dosage using only a maternal sample. We have applied this technology to sickle cell disease and 8 X linked disorders todetermine clinical utility. Methods: ddPCR assays were designed and validated using gDNA for the pathogenic variant. Testing was per formed on cfDNA from maternal plasma samples for 22 sickle cell risk pregnancies and 10 X linked mutations. Fetal fraction was determined using three different methods. Fetal genotype predictions were generated using sequential probability ratio test, with results con ï¬rmed by invasive sampling. Results: For sickle cell disease, correct predictions of fetal HBB genotype were generated for 11 samples, with 2 incorrect predictions and 9 inconclusive results. Incorrectand inconclusive predictions resulted from low fetal fraction and threshold positioning during analysis. For X linked conditions, assay design has been successful and develop ment of the analysis pipeline initiated. Conclusions: ddPCR has the potential to be used for NIPD for maternal mutation carriers using only a maternalsample. We will report testing of over 50 additional ongo ing cases to re ï¬ne and validate the analysis pipeline to further extend the scope of our NIPD clinical service. J. Shaw: None. S. Sheppard: None.

Oldak1 1Department of Genetics, Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing, Warsaw, Poland,2Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland,3Novum Fertility Clinic, Warsaw, Poland Background: Aneuploidy is the most frequent type of chromosome aberration and the most signi ï¬cant clinically. It occurs as a result of meiotic chromosomal malsegregation during formation of a haploid oocyte by subsequentextrusion of two polar bodies: polar body ï¬rst (PB1) and second (PB2). Based on meiosis mechanism, genome of a single oocyte can be deduced by analyzing its sibling polarbodies. Material and Methods: Next generation sequencing technology for comprehensive chromosome screening wasused to assess ploidy status of the oocytes and their sibling PB1. A total of 120 single cells (60 PB1 and 60 oocytes) were subjected for whole genome ampli ï¬cation (WGA) using four different commercially available WGA kits and analyzed using VeriSeq PGS kit on the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). Random samples were validated using genomicarrays (aCGH). Aneuploidy detection with the tested kits was evaluated. Results: Aneuploidy status was determined for 112 of 120 (93,3%) samples. In the group of well ampli ï¬ed PB1 oocyte pairs (33/60) a 97% concordance between the chromosomal status of PB1 and the corresponding oocytewas observed. Differences in WGA kits performance including ampli ï¬cation uniformity and aneuploidy calling potential were evaluated and the most optimal kit for PB1genome WGA was selected. Results from aCGH validation of the randomly selected samples showed full consistency with the NGS results. Conclusions: NGS based method used for PB1 genome analysis showed a high predictive potential of PB1 in deducing ploidy status of the corresponding oocyte and is apromising method for genetic preconception testing of oocytes.

The founder mutation DHCR7 :c.964 1G>C was introduced into the Israeli preconception screening tests for Ashkenazi Jews in 2017 since the carrier frequency of the mutation is high in this population (1.2%). Despite the high carrier rate, the disease itself is not known to be frequent in this population. Discrepancy between the carrier and disease frequency raises the question of the actual risks for affected offspringfor couples detected by the screening program. Methods: We performed a literature review of all pub lications available with detailed information regardinghomozygous DHCR7 :c.964 1G>C fetuses/patients were included. We also collected clinical data about the couples identi ï¬ed in the national screening program, such as reproductive history. Results: Out of 31 homozygous fetuses, six died in utero (IUFD), ten pregnancies were terminated during the secondtrimester and 15 children were born. All 15 died between day one till three months of age. Reproductive history of Smith Lemli Opitz at risk couples showed that out of 61pregnancies, 32 spontaneous miscarriages were reported (52%). Discussion: Our observations support the previous knowledge that homozygosity for c.964 1G>C in DHCR7 leads to a severe phenotype or early spontaneous abortion.

Heterozygous exon 7 deletion of SMN1 is de ï¬ned as a carrier with the reported frequency of 1/40 to 1/50 worldwide. Clinical practice in many countries recommends SMA carrier screening for most couples at thepreconception stage. Materials and Methods: We developed a quantitative real time PCR protocol to detect SMN1 exon 7 deletion (SMADX7 â¢) as a cost effective method, aiming to per form carrier screening in 430 Thai individuals visiting preconception clinic. Validation of the method was done in100 positive and negative controls compared to standard DHPLC method. Results: The result of control testing was 100% con sistent between real time PCR and DHPLC. Further popu lation screening revealed the SMA carrier frequency of 1/ 72. Conclusion: Developing of SMADX7 â¢is an out standing strategy for SMA carrier screening in Thai popu lation due to good cost bene ï¬t and rapid turnaround time within 24 hours. Carrier frequency in our cohort seemed to be lower than global frequency; however, additional sub jects are required to be enrolled, aiming to obtain thenational data that can represent overall carrier frequency.

Low coverage whole genome sequencing is able to detect not only most commonly screened chromosomalaneuploidies but also different subchromosomal aberrations. Aim: Aim of the work was prospective study of detection and validation of subchromosomal aberrations of fetal ori gin identi ï¬ed as part of routine noninvasive prenatal testing. Materials and Methods: From April 2016 till December 2018, more than 8000 samples of pregnant women usingIllumina NextSeq 500 platform were analysed. Low cov erage whole genome sequencing was used in combination with optimized CNV detection algorithm. Results: In tested cohort of patients different suchromo somal aberrations were detected in 32 samples. Half of patients (16) refused con ï¬rmatory testing or we were not able to get sample or feedback from the further management of the patient. In second half of samples (16) DNA from amniocenteses were available for con ï¬rmatory testing. Of these cases 5 ï¬ndings were con ï¬rmed and 11 were negative after veri ï¬cation analyses. In samples with detected aber rations fetal fraction varied between 10,3 and 18,26 %. Thesmallest reported aberration was 1 Mb and the largest one approx. 80 Mb long. Conclusions: In this prospective study the possibility of utilization of low coverage genomic sequencing for detec tion of subchromosomal aberrations over the whole genome was con ï¬rmed.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the association between subfertility and spontaneous abortion. Methods: A total of 122 women in Constanta reported 384 pregnancies between 2014 and 2018 and were able to provide an estimate of the waiting time to conception for 276 (71.87% of the 384 eligible pregnancies). We notedretrospective data, including sociodemographic character istics, obstetric and medical history, genetic risk factors, cigarette smoking, caffeine and alcohol consumption, andoccupational information. Rates of spontaneous abortion were determined among women with and without sub fertility, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con ï¬dence intervals (CIs) were estimated via multiple logistic regression. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analyses with generalized estimating equations indicated that spontaneous abortion rates were 28.0% in pregnancies preceded by subfertility and 17.0% in pregnancies without impairedfertility (adjusted OR ,1.68, 95% CI ,1.36, 2.84).

Both Î² thalassemia carrier couple would transmit 1/4 risk of thalassemia major to their offspring in every pregnancy. Thalassemia major patients require lifelong transfusions, iron chelation therapy and, an expensivesupport system. These bring a great socioeconomic burden to the suffered family. PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis) for Î² thalassemia is conducted in IVF (in vitro fertilization) to transfer an embryo without thalassemia major to the uterus. The problem of allele dropout (ADO) and preferential ampli ï¬cation highly exist in PGD involving WGA (whole genome ampli ï¬cation) of blastocyst biopsies. It had been reported that a combination of Sanger sequencing and QF PCR of STR markers increased thedetection rate of the mutated Î² globin gene in PGD. However, the uninformative STRs and ADO of the mutated gene usually limited the validation of PGD. Moreover, theheterozygosity rate of STRs is highly population different. In this study, we veri ï¬ed several STRs for providing enough informative STRs for Taiwan Î² thalassemia popula tion. Our results showed that six linked STRs (D11S4146, D11S1760, D11S1243, D11S4891, D11S2352, and D11S1871) with highly heterozygous polymorphism andlow recombination rate in Taiwan population and would achieve up to 99% diagnostic validation in PGD for Î² thalassemia.

Detection of the most common fetal aneuploidies is ordinarily performed using NGStechnology. Low concentration of cffDNA in maternal circulation prevents the utilization of cheaper and simpler technology droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The aim of ourstudy was to overcome this problem by target multiplexing. Methods: Three genes on chromosome 21 and chromo some 18 were absolutely quanti ï¬ed in one ddPCR reaction (hexaplex). Targets on different chromosomes were dis tinguished using different labelling (FAM/HEX). Expected1212FAM/HEX ratio for DNA with normal karyotype is 1. In case of fetal trisomy of 21 or 18, the ratio will be de ï¬ected accordingly. Arti ï¬cial mixtures of euploid and trisomic DNA were used for pilot study. Results: DNA with normal karyotype was systematically mixed with DNA with trisomy of 21 (0%; 5%; 10%; 20%;40%); chromosome 18 was used as a reference chromosome in this case. Eight replicates for each mixture were per formed. Detected FAM/HEX ratios always corresponded tothe expected ratios for respective mixtures. Even the lowest representation of aneuploid DNA (5%) was correctly detected. Conclusion: After promising results of the initial phase with the arti ï¬cial mixtures, the optimized work ï¬ow will now be applied for the analysis of plasma of pregnantwomen. This method could be applicable for detection of trisomy 21 or 18 in the same reaction, as both trisomies together have never been observed.

C. van Diemen Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, Groningen, Netherlands Introduction: Identifying the cause of fetal anomalies seen on ultrasound provides important information for perinatalmanagement, but we can diagnose only ~40% of fetuses using conventional genetic tests (QF PCR and microarray). Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) may improve diagnosticyield, but is challenging due to uncertainties around fetal phenotyping, variant interpretation, ethical/counseling issues of incidental ï¬ndings and variants of unknown clinical signi ï¬cance, and the requirement of short turn around times. In this study, we implemented WES in prenatal care to increase our diagnostic yield. Materials and Methods: We conducted a prospective study of rapid trio WES analysis next to conventional genetic tests for twenty ï¬ve fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities. Inclusion criteria were at least two congenital malformations on ultrasound or one congenitalmalformation in a fetus with a sib with similar phenotype, without known genetic cause. We performed trio WES analysis using a custom virtual gene panel (~3,800 OMIM genes, excluding late onset disease genes). Results: We established an additional genetic WES based diagnosis in nine fetuses, being: syndromes of MIRAGE(SAMD9 ), Zellweger ( PEX1 ), Walker Warburg (POMGNT1 ), Noonan ( PTNP11 ), Kabuki (KMT2D ), CHARGE ( CHD7 ); two cases of Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 2 ( COL1A1 ), and one potential diagnosis in a fetus with hydrops ( MYH7 ). In six out of 25 cases the WES diagnosis aided in perinatal management. The mean turn around time was 10 (range 6 15) working days. Conclusion: Our prospective study shows that imple menting WES as a routine test in the prenatal setting ischallenging, but technically feasible and has a promising diagnostic yield and signi ï¬cant clinical relevance.

It provides betterresolution than conventional karyotyping, nevertheless, CNVs with variable expressivity and low penetrance require a proper interpretation attitude. Materials and Methods: More than 2200 prenatal sam ples (AMC, CVS) were examined at our clinic within the last two years. In 9.8% samples an aneuploidy was detectedby QFPCR. The remaining samples were analyzed by CMA as aï¬rst tier test: samples were assessed by array CGH (or SNP array) and analyzed with AgilentCytoGenomics soft ware. Parental samples were analyzed using CMA to spe cify the origin of the identi ï¬ed aberrations. Results: 72 CMA analyzed samples were considered to be pathogenic (out of them 56 below karyotype resolution) while additional 112 cases as variants of unknown sig niï¬cance: class 2, 3 and 4 (likely benign, uncertain clinical relevance, likely pathogenic) or without subclassi ï¬cation.

ECS reports are currently limited to pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPV). Variants of unknown signiï¬cance (VOUS) are not reported, even though reporting VOUS is routine in genomic and chromosomal array testing in both postnatal and prenatal settings. This policy misses pairings of PV/LPV carriers with VOUScarriers (PV/LPV*VOUS), who may be at risk. To evaluate the importance of this omission, we examined the rates and characteristics of PV/LPV*VOUS virtual matings in anAshkenazi Jewish (AJ) cohort, a population with well established preconception screening. Methods: We ana lyzed 672 AJ genomes (225,456 virtual couples) forvariants in different gene panels (exons Â±10bp): AJ (55 genes), pan ethnic (168 genes) and combined (180 genes), using an ACMG classi ï¬er. Results: Across 180 genes, we identi ï¬ed 4671 variants, among them 144 (3.1%) were PV/LPV and 1963 (42%)were VOUS. The proportion of matings who were PV/ LPV*PV/LPV was 2.7 3.8% (depending on the panel), similar to previous reports. The proportion of PV/ LPV*VOUS matings was 17 20%. Considering only exo nic, non UTR VOUS resulted in a decreased proportion of PV/LPV*VOUS matings to â7%. Most (65 70%) PV/ LPV*VOUS matings were at risk for severe/profoundly severe diseases, while only 6 7% were at risk for mild diseases. Conclusions: Non reporting of VOUS in ECS may miss at risk couples for severe diseases. Reporting PV/ LPV*VOUS couples would triple the proportion of at riskcouples, even if considering only exonic, non UTR VOUS. Even if only 10% of VOUS are ultimately reclassi ï¬ed as PV/LPV, reporting PV/LPV*VOUS would increase theyield of ECS by â25%. H. Fridman: None. D. Behar: A.

30133,"klinikos, Kaunas, Lithuania Introduction: Aniridia is a very rare congenital panocular disorder characterized by complete or partial iris hypopla sia. PAX6 gene mutations occur in around 90% of aniridia cases. Two thirds of aniridia cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and 1/3 are sporadic cases. Materials and Methods: PAX6 gene analysis was per formed for patients who were diagnosed with isolated and syndromic aniridia. Their ï¬rst line and/or affected family members also was analysed. The PAX6 gene was analysed by Sanger sequencing (2 13 exones). If no point mutations were found, analysis was extended to deletion/ duplication search with multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ï¬ca tion (MLPA) kit ( MRC Holland SALSA MLPA P219 PAX6 kit). Results: 5 families and 3 single cases were tested for PAX6 gene mutations in 2 years period (2017 2018) (20 analyses altogether). Six different mutations were found in 15 (75%) cases: 1 missense mutation, 1 intragenic deletion,4 nonsense mutations. The 2 truncating mutations (c.991C>T (p. Arg331Ter) and c.392_393delTA (p. Ile131Thrfs*15)) were newly described. De novo PAX6 gene variant c.991C>T (p. Arg331Ter) was found for patient, who diagnosed with aniridia and doubled kidney. PAX6 gene variant c.392_393delTA (p. Ile131Thrfs*15) was found for family members with isolated aniridia. Members of one family with various clinical presentation (unilateral aniridia and Peters anomaly, cataracts, opticnerve hypoplasia) shared missense variant of unknown signiï¬cance c.422T>C (p. Leu141Pro).Conclusions: We would like to suggest that PAX6 gene variants c.991C>T (p. Arg331Ter) and c.392_393delTA (p. Ile131Thrfs*15) are cause of aniridia for our patients. R. Traberg: None. V.

30134,"Genetics Department, IIS FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az CIBERER, UAM, Madrid, Spain Abnormal development of the iris is a feature of severalcongenital ocular malformations. Classical aniridia, the most common form, is a panocular disease characterized by iris and foveal hypoplasia, keratopathy, cataracts andglaucoma, caused by PAX6 haploinsuf ï¬ciency. The pre sence of variable expressivity and phenotypic overlapping with other types of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD)hinders the genetic characterization of atypical presentations of aniridia. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of NGS to improve the clinical diagnosis of these pathologies. Acohort of 106 families was studied, including cases with classical aniridia or atypical forms (iris hypoplasia, atrophy or coloboma). The entire PAX6 gene and other 260 genes associated with ocular malformations were analyzed using custom targeted NGS and aCGH approaches, as well as clinical or whole exome and/or Sanger sequencing. About82% of the cases presented likely pathogenic variants or CNVs in 5 different genes. Defects in PAX6 explain 75% of cases, including not only all characterized cases withclassical aniridia, but also 30% of patients with more atypical presentations, in whom LOF or atypical missense and non coding variants were identi ï¬ed, respectively. Other aniridia like patients presented pathogenic variants in ASD related genes or variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance in candidate genes. Molecular analysis of iris malformationspresents high diagnostic yield not only in cases with classical aniridia (95%) but also in patients with aniridia like phenotypes (>50%). Our work evidences the clinicalutility of differential genetic studies based on NGS in patients with congenital iris anomalies.

Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Federal State Institution, Cheboksary, Russian Federation,3Far Eastern Federal University, Vladivostok, Russian Federation,4Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation Objectives: Aniridia is an autosomal dominant severe panocular disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the PAX6 gene or large chromosomal aberrations affecting 11p13 region. Aniridia phenotype varies greatly. Based on the occurrence of several aniridia characteristics in groups of patients with the same type of PAX6 mutation, genotype âphenotype correlations were analyzed. Methods: 155 patients from 129 unrelated families were examined in the course of the earlier study, 118 patientswere found to have intragenic pathogenic variants while 37 others have large chromosomal deletions. Patients were allocated into 6 groups according to the type of PAX6 mutation: missense, nonsense, frame shifting, splicing, 3 â² cis regulatory region deletions, and all other 11p13 chro mosome deletions. Data on six frequently observed aniridiceye anomalies were collected: complete or partial aniridia, cataract, glaucoma, kerathopathy, fovea hypoplasia, and nystagmus. Fisher âs exact test with Benjamini âHochberg correction for multiple testing was applied for 2Ã2 con tingency tables created to compare occurrence of each ocular sign in the group of patients with one type ofmutations versus the corresponding occurrence in the group with all other mutations. Results: Only patients with 3 â² cis regulatory region deletions signi ï¬cantly more often develop a distinct and milder aniridia phenotype without kerathopathy, fovea hypoplasia and nystagmus. Identi ï¬ed missense and splicing mutations were associated with severe aniridia phenotype and in their consequences could not be distinguished from the loss of function mutations. Conclusions: Revealed genotype phenotype correlations inPAX6 associated aniridia suggests common disease mechanism for all mutations except for 3 â² cis regulatory region deletions.

30136,"M. Corton IIS University Hospital FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az, Madrid, Spain Congenital aniridia is a panocular disease, with a worldwide incidence of 1:50.000 100.000 births, characterized by iris and foveal hypoplasia and additional anomalies in thecornea, anterior segment and lens, leading to low visual acuity. Up to 90% of the aniridia cases carried monoallelic loss of function variants causing haploinsuf ï¬ciency of PAX6 , a highly conserved transcriptional regulator that is critical for normal ocular development. Here, we aimed to assess functionally the implication on splicing of different exonic and intronic variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS), mainly located in the PAX6 homeodomain. First, novel VUS including synonymous, missense and non canonical splicing variants were identi ï¬ed in our cohort of 87 Spanish families with aniridia after classical genotyping and/or targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of theentire PAX6 locus. No additional pathogenic variants were found in other 250 eye developmental genes. Functional splicing assays were performed using in silico predictors, in vitro minigenes and, when available, patients derived lymphocytes cell lines. We described new spliceogenic mechanisms for PAX6 variants through activating different exonic cryptic donors as the most plausible cause for congenital aniridia in several families. These included an additional case of parental PAX6 mosaicism, as con ï¬rmed by digital droplet PCR, for a synonymous variant in an asymptomatic mother with two affected siblings. In conclusion, clinical interpretation of silent and non canonical splicing variants represents a real challenge for the genetic counseling. Our study revealed the importance of functional studies to elucidate the role of non codingPAX6 variants underlying ocular development.

Raffaele Scienti ï¬c Institute, Milan, Italy Introduction: With the progressive ageing of world population, there is a need to further investigate the genetic base of late onset disorders such as ARHL. With this study,we aim to increase our knowledge of this complex disease. Materials and Methods: We performed a case control GWAS analysis on 2663 subjects (aged > ,50) coming from Italy, Northern Europe and Caucasus clinically char acterized including the audiometric phenotype. Cases and controls were classi ï¬ed as previously described (DOI:10.3109/21695717.2014.911472). Genotype data were imputed using 1000Gph3 reference panel. Results were pooled together with METAL. Replication of resultswas performed with UK Biobank data (ie. speech in noise phenotype). Analyses on natural selection in European populations were performed and integrated haplotype scores(iHS) on signi ï¬cant GWAS results were collected. Results: Meta analysis identi ï¬ed some strongly sig niï¬cant loci. To prioritize these genes, signals of selection were checked to evaluate the presence of genetic variants that could have some evolutionary role and a stronger effect. A signi ï¬cant hit on chr5 was detected in a gene/ protein (|iHS|score>2) catalysing the conversion of homo cysteine to other amino acids. Signal of selection was pre sent in North European populations, but absent in SouthEuropean ones. Interestingly, literature showed a relation ship between hyperhomocysteinemia induced by folate deï¬ciency and premature hearing loss, prompting further investigation and discussion on these results. Conclusions: As the association signal is mainly driven by Northern Italian and European populations, a population speciï¬c haplotype involved in folate metabolism should also implicated directly or indirectly in ARHL.

Genetic mechanisms that alter these processes may therefore have secondary effects on emergent language. In this work, we consider variationsacross the USH2A gene and characterise an allelic hierarchy associated with alternate and distinct clinical manifestations including Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), Develop mental Language Disorder (DLD) and Usher syndrome. Materials and Methods: This investigation combines whole genome sequencing data from a family affected by asevere form of APD and speech dysarthria with genetic characterisation of two large population cohorts; the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) andUK10K. To compliment human ï¬ndings, a mouse model with a genetic knockout of the rodent homolog Ush2a was assessed for auditory processing and vocalizations. Results: Combined human and mouse results show: (1) heterozygous USH2A disruptions lead to impaired low frequency sound perception; (2) low level hearing impair ments caused by heterozygous disruption of Ush2a associate with persistent higher order acoustic processing deï¬cits and altered vocalizations in mice; and (3) risk var iants of USH2A combined with altered low frequency1218hearing thresholds lead to signi ï¬cantly worse language outcomes in humans. Conclusions: We identify a complex, interactive genetic mechanism under which variants in USH2A contribute to low frequency hearing loss and alter higher order auditory processing increasing the risk of language disorder. Sincethese variants are found in 0.85% of the population, we recommend comprehensive genetic screening to enable the early identi ï¬cation of carrier individuals alongside speci ï¬c assessment of low frequency hearing in individuals at risk.

Polymeropoulos2 1Vanda Pharmaceuticals, WASHINGTON, DC, United States,2Vanda Pharmaceuticals, DC, OH, United States To ascertain the genetic risk factors for morningness/ eveningness phenotypes we conducted a genome wideassociation analysis using 316 whole genome sequencing samples. We have directly tested the association between SNPs and MEQ (morning evening questionnaire). Wecomputed association test results by linear regression assuming additive allelic effects (covariates: age, gender, and the 3 PCs). We detect a large region on chromosome 5(more than ~400 adjacent SNPs in LD, spanning ~2mb) centered within HCN1, Brain Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channel 1. Regional enrichment yields a p value of < 10 99. It is highly expressed in the brain and potentially modulates excitability in the brain and responding to regulation by cyclic nucleotides, playing a critical role inshaping the autonomous activity of single neurons and the periodicity of network oscillations. It has been shown in a double mutant mouse model that lack of HNC1 mediatedfeedback in rod photoreceptor cells prolongs rod responses and saturates the downstream retinal network during bright light stimulation. The risk allele is effectively correlatedwith lower MEQ score hence evening phenotype. The locus has been shown to be a signi ï¬cant (1.6e 09) eQTL for HCN1 in GTEX. HCN1 channel is responsible for thefeedback on the rods regulating the dynamic range of light reactivity under dim or intermediate light conditions. We hypothesize that if this feedback is not functioning properlyan individual may get saturated with even dim light resulting in misperception of the light conditions resultingAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1219in a circadian delay.

Sergouniotis1 1University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 2Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary âs Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom,3Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom,4Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Advances in ocular genetics have trans formed our understanding of inherited eye diseases (IEDs)and have led to the development of powerful diagnostic tests. However, integration of these tests into routine healthcare is frequently ineffective. Providing robustevidence of bene ï¬t can accelerate implementation; for example, the adoption of a genetic test is much more likely when its clinical utility (i.e. its ability to in ï¬uence management and health outcomes) has been clearly demonstrated. Here we assess the current clinical utility of genetic testing in paediatric IED. Materials and Methods: Unrelated children (0 5 years old) with IED were retrospectively ascertained through the database of the UK North West Genomic Laboratory Hub. The cohort was consecutively collected and included indi viduals presenting between 09/2011 and 08/2018. All study participants were examined in tertiary paediatric ophthalmicgenetic clinics and underwent panel based genetic testing. Results: 229 children were evaluated including 33 with albinism, 83 with bilateral paediatric cataracts, 19 withcongenital glaucoma, 7 with ectopia lentis and 57 with inherited retinal disorders. The diagnostic yield was highest for albinism and ectopia lentis and lowest for congenitalglaucoma. Genetic testing altered management (e.g. pre vented additional investigations or led to the introduction of personalised surveillance measures or determined eligibilityfor treatment trials) in signi ï¬cant subsets of children with ectopia lentis, albinism, bilateral cataracts and inherited retinal disorders. Conclusions: Genetic testing helped identify an aetiolo gical diagnosis in the majority of children with IED.

In this report we present the results of the c.1621C>T (p.

The highest carrier frequency of this mutationwas found in Yakut population (7.9%), the lowest in Evenks (1.7%) and Evens (2.0%), and c.1621C>T (p. Gln541*) was absent in Russians, Yukaghirs, Dolgans andChukchi. Common haplotypes for c.1621C>T (p.

30142,"Molecular Genetics Department, Bioiatriki S. A., Athens, Greece Introduction: Cataracts are the principal cause of treatable blindness worldwide. Inherited congenital cataract shows all types of inheritance patterns in a syndromic and non syndromic form. Congenital Cataract is an opaci ï¬cation of the lens, usually diagnosed at birth and without proper treatment, the vision never develops normally. In this studywe present a family from Central Greece with six affected members born with Congenital Cataract, ï¬ve males and one female, all of which had bilateral nuclear cataracts asnewborns. Despite efforts to medically improve their condition, many members had a gradual deterioration of their vision which led to blindness, before the age of thirtyyears old. Materials and Methods: Clinical Exome Sequencing (CES) was performed with the Sophia Genetics Protocol ona MiSeq Illumina platform, in one of the affected probands. In order to con ï¬rm our ï¬nding and to investigate the carrier status of most family members, Sanger sequencing wasperformed for the region of interest. Results: The analysis revealed a possibly pathologic mutation c.3808C>T(p. Gln1270*) on the NHS gene, which is located on the X chromosome. The mutation has not been previously recorded in any database but the NHS gene is known to be the cause of X linked CongenitalCataract Nans Hooran Syndrome. Conclusion: CES of related subjects from an isolated family with Congenital Cataract identi ï¬ed a causal NHS mutation and con ï¬rmed the mode of inheritance in the family as X linked recessive. This ï¬nding will aid drama tically the clinical management of this whole family. E. Louizou: None. S. Rapti: None. A. Vasiageorgi: None. G. Kapetsis: None. E. Tsitsopoulos: None. C.

30143,"Medical Genetics, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Congenital cataract is a developmental disorder of the lens resulting in lens cloudiness or opacities. The hereditary congenital cataracts are genetically hetero geneous and can be transmitted under an autosomal dominant, recessive or X linked inheritance model. TheMAF gene (OMIM*177075) pathogenic sequence variants in the c terminal DNA binding domain have been shown to cause autosomal dominant isolated congenital cataractphenotype. On the other hand, MAF N terminal transacti vation domain genetic variants are associated with Ayme Gripp syndrome (OMIM#601088), in which the eyeanomalies are accompanied by intellectual disability, sensorineural hearing loss, seizures, distinctive facial appearance, reduced growth and skeletal anomalies. Materials and Methods: A female patient, law graduate by profession, was referred to genetic consultation in her ï¬rst pregnancy for her history of bilateral congenital cat aract. Other medical history was unremarkable, except for mild delay in achieving developmental milestones and mild unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. She never neededhearing aid. General examination at 30 years showed nor mal height and distinctive ï¬at facial appearance. Clinical exome sequencing was used to test for causative variants in110 known genes associated with isolated and syndromic cataract. Results: A heterozygous likely pathogenic de novo missense variant c.188C>G (Pro63Arg) in the N terminal transactivation domain of the MAF gene was identi ï¬ed. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst report of pathogenic variant in the N terminal transactivation domain of the MAF gene in an individual without intellectual disability/learning dif ï¬culties, seizures or signi ï¬cant hearing loss.

CNVs are frequently found in the STRC gene which is related to autosomal recessive HL. Due to presence of STRC pseudogene and technological limitation of CNVs detec tion, large deletions and duplications encompassing STRC are still an underestimated contributor to HL development. Material and Methods: A group of 50 patients with mild to moderate HL diagnosed before the age of 10 andwith no DFNB1 pathogenic was recruited for the study. All patients were tested for CNVs in STRC gene using quanti tative comparative ï¬uorescent PCR (QF PCR) with primers speciï¬c to the STRC gene and its pseudogene followed by multiplex ligation probe ampli ï¬cation (MLPA). Results: Genetic prescreen with QF PCR revealed a complete deletion of the STRC tested regions in 24% (24/ 100) and partial deletion in 5% of the studied alleles (5/ 100). This method allowed us also to identify two completeand two partial deletion of tested regions in the STRC pseudogene. Complete deletions of the STRC gene regions were fully con ï¬rmed by MLPA. One additional STRC partial deletion and one duplication were also detected. Considering the genotypes, in 26% (13/50) of HL patients homozygous or compound heterozygous CNVs weredetected. In 10% (5/50) of patients only simple hetero zygous CNVs was found. Conclusions: This study shows that CNVs in STRC are a frequent cause of mild to moderate hearing loss in Polish patients. There is a strong need to include CNVs analysis of STRC gene in the standard HL diagnostic work ï¬ow. B. Harasimowicz: None. D. Ozieblo: None. H. Skar zynski: None. M. Oldak: None.",2019

It is a complex trait inï¬uenced by multiple genes and environmental factors. A debated hypothesis is that many rare variants might contribute to the missing heritability unexplained by common variants. Since frequencies of rare variants arevery low, even with high penetrance, it is challenging to detect association. Burden tests collapse the rare variants within the gene as a single genetic variable. This studyproposes a gene wise burden test to look for genes with an overrepresentation of variations in painful (PDN) versus painless (PLDN) diabetic neuropathy patients. Material and Methods: 107 candidate genes were sequenced by single molecule Molecular Probes Next Generation Sequencing (MIP NGS) in 61 PDN and 125PLDN patients. To test differences in the mutational burden between PDN and PLDN, we applied SKAT O test as implemented in EPACTS on all non synonymous variantswith a maximum minor allele frequency of 5%. Results: Comparing the excess of rare variants in PDN respect to PLDN, P2RX7 andSCN11A showed the lowest p values (p ,0.01 and p ,0.03, respectively) even if they did not reach the signi ï¬cant Bonferroni threshold. Conclusions: The burden approach provided biologically plausible signals that would have remained indistinguish able from random noise with the traditional single variant analysis, because of high allelic heterogeneity. Our resultscould leave the possibility that a combination of protein altering variants in P2RX7 andSCN11A contribute to the risk of PDN.

30145,"connexin 26 (GJB2) have been shown as a major contributor to prelingual, sensorineural, nonsyndromic, recessive deafness. One speci ï¬c mutation, 35delG, has accounted for the majority of the mutations detected in the GJB2 gene in Caucasian populations. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the characterisation and theprevalence of all, GJB2, GJB6 and other known mutations among affected individuals from North Eastern Slovenia. Materials and Methods: There were 33 individuals diagnosed with hereditary deafness (DF) enrolled in the study. The allele speci ï¬c PCR, MLPA technique and the Sanger sequencing was used to screen the GJB2 codingregion. NGS sequencing with Oto GeneSGKit Â®was used in 10 probands with bilateral, pre lingual non syndromic DF with a negative medical history related to potential causes ofacquired DF. Results: The overall diagnostic yield of the DF cohort was 8/33 (24.2%). The homozygous mutation c.35delG wasidenti ï¬ed in four out of 33 patients (12.1%). By ï¬ve patients mono allelic mutation c.35delG was detected (15.15%; 5/ 33).

Conclusion: The relative low ratio of individuals homo zygous (12.1%) and heterozygous (15.15%) for the c.35delG mutation suggest that there are other genes responsible for nonsyndromic deafness in the North EasternSlovenian population.

Materials and Methods: Eleven patients from eight families were shown to have bilateral profound hearingimpairment with variable additional clinical features. Complete or partial agenesis of the semicircular canals gave suspicion of either CHARGE or Waardenburg syndrome. Results: Genetic testing was carried out which included genes involved in these two syndromes. Here we present eight families harboring SOX10 pathogenic variants. The patients demonstrated a spectrum of SOX10 mutations of which six were novel, six occurred de novo and two were found to be dominantly inherited.

Identi ï¬cation of the causative variants underlying hearing impairment is challenging, since >100 different genes for1224non syndromic hearing impairment have so far been reported. Materials and Methods: In this study, 200 index patients, mostly of Danish origin, with hearing impairment underwent targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using hearing impairment gene panels for Illumina plat forms. Causative variants were con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis was performed when relevant samples were available. Prior to NGS sequencing,DFNB1 and SLC26A4 related hearing impairment had been excluded by Sanger sequencing in most patients. Result: Of the 200 patients sequenced, we were able to detect causative variants in 73 cases (37%). Furthermore, in an additional 12 cases (6%) only one pathogenic variant was identi ï¬ed so far. The study emphasizes the genetic heterogeneity of hearing impairment since causative var iants were found in 41 different genes. In total, 113 different likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants were detected. Forty four variants (38%) were novel (absent from the literature). Conclusions: Targeted Next Generation Sequencing allowed us to detect causative variants in 73 of tested cases. In this cohort, the diagnostic yield was slightly higher in cases with presumed autosomal recessive hearing impair ment and in patients with an early onset of hearing impairment.

For 6% patients with only one pathogenic GJB2 mutation (monoallelic) the second is unknown. Moreover, there is a signi ï¬cant excess of monoallelic among hearing loss population (6%) compared to the normal hearing population (3%). Therefore we assume the second causal mutation, yet unknown, in part ofmonallelic hearing loss patients which explain their hearing loss. Because of the character of GJB2 mutations, we expected to ï¬nd the CNV, most likely one deletion within the critical region. Materials and Methods: The CNV analysis was per formed with SureSelect custom panel covering continuouschr13:20.735.021 21.102.144. Altogether 33 monoallelic patients were examined with use of three biallelic GJB2 patients as controls. The CNV analysis was performed withNextGene sw. Results: The shared 1.6kb large deletion was found in four monoallelic. Nevertheless, the deletion was not possi ble to con ï¬rm with use of another independent method as Sanger sequencing or PCR. Even the haplotype analysis did not reveal any common haplotype in monoallelic. More over, the NGS of a gene panel of 71 recessive hearing loss genes did not reveal causal mutation in other gene in group of 15 monoallelic. Conclusion: Therefore we believe the second unknown and undiscovered mutation which contribute and cause hearing loss in the substantial part of GJB2 monoallelic patients exist, but is probably not the CNV in the critical DFNB1 region.

To date, only three frameshift mutations were described in the N terminal cytoplasmic domain of KCNQ4 in ADHL families with late onset and pure high frequency HL. Materials and Methods: DNA was collected from a ï¬ve generation family with progressive high frequency ADHL. High throughput sequencing on proband âs DNA was per formed. In family members (n ,15) segregation analysis of the identi ï¬ed variants with HL was conducted using Sanger sequencing. Deep genotype phenotype correlation analysiswas performed using cross sectional linear regression test ing of pure tone audiometry results. Results: Genetic testing revealed a novel, probably pathogenic c.274G>A (p. Glu92Lys) variant in KCNQ4 , which fully segregated with HL in the studied family. Detected variant has not been reported in population data bases and was classi ï¬ed as pathogenic. The p. Glu92Lys is theï¬rst missense variant identi ï¬ed in the N terminal cyto plasmic region of KCNQ4. HL observed in the analyzedfamily was more severe at mid frequencies as compared to the previously published families with truncating variants located in this domain. Conclusions: Identi ï¬cation of KCNQ4 p. Glu92Lys in a ADHL family con ï¬rms the association between missense KCNQ4 pathogenic variants and a high frequency HL with similar annual progression at mid and high frequencies. The data suggest that the type of KCNQ4 detected variants provides a better prognostic factor than their topologicallocalization.

High throughput genetic analysis using the TruSight One panel (Illumina Inc.) and the MiSeq sequencer was carried out forthe probands. To con ï¬rm the presence of identi ï¬ed genetic variants and their segregation with ADHL in individual families Sanger âs sequencing was performed. Results: Genetic cause of ADHL was identi ï¬ed in approximately 60% (8/13) of the families. The identi ï¬ed variants were located in ACTG1 ,COCH ,DIAPH1 ,EYA4 , KCNQ4 ,PTPRQ ,TBC1D24 andTMC1 . Among the iden tiï¬ed variants approximately 60% (6/8) were novel. In the remaining families the selected variants did not segregatewith ADHL. Conclusions: Our results show high genetic heterogeneity of ADHL in Polish pediatric patients. Considering frequentidenti ï¬cation of new genetic variants, it is necessary to perform thorough clinical examination and segregation analysis of the selected variants with ADHL in the largestpossible number of family members. In patients with no genetic cause identi ï¬ed, the study area should be extended and include all protein coding regions or whole genome.

Autosomal dominant HL (ADHL) is usually characterized by postlingual age of onset and progression. To date 63 loci with 45 different geneswere causally involved in the pathogenesis of ADHL. Materials and Methods: Multigenerational families with ADHL were recruited in the study (n ,19). Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and buccal swabs samples. In probands âDNA samples a multigene high throughput sequencing was performed. Family segregation analysis of the identi ï¬ed variants was conducted using Sanger sequencing. All detected variants were analyzed in the context of population databases and literature. Pathogeni city of identi ï¬ed variants was predicted by different com putational approaches. Results: Genetic testing revealed probably pathogenic variants in almost 63% (12/19) of the analyzed families. The majority of identi ï¬ed variants were novel, previously not reported and hitherto not linked to the disease (7/12). Novel variants were missense changes and all of them(except for two genetic changes located in MYO6 ) were found in different genes. Conclusions: Our study revealed a high involvement of novel probably pathogenic variants in the development of ADHL and con ï¬rmed a high heterogeneity of the identi ï¬ed genetic changes. High throughput sequencing in HL patientsgenerates large amount of data that should be interpreted carefully and con ï¬rmed by family studies. There is also a need for functional validation of the detected novel variants. Supported by: NCN Research Grant no. 2016/22/E/NZ5/ 00470 SONATA BIS6. D. Ozieblo: None. M. L. Leja: None. A.

Cochlear implantation (CI) is a treatment of choice in profound HL patients but onlyfew studies combine the etiology of HL with CI outcome. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1227Materials and Methods: Patients with profound pre lingual HL who received CI before the age of 2 years and had a completed DFNB1 genetic testing were enrolled in the study (n ,159). LittlEARS questionnaire and relative auditory development delay (RADD) at 6thmonth after CI activation were used to assess auditory development. Results: Statistically signi ï¬cant differences were observed in RADD between patients implanted early (before 12 months of age) vs. late (after 12 months of age)and between patients with a short ( â¤6 months) vs. long ( â¥ 6 months) hearing aids (HAs) experience. Interestingly, in the most genetically homogenous patient group with twoGJB2 c.35delG pathogenic variants there was no statisti cally signi ï¬cant difference in RADD between patients implanted early and late and between patients with a shortand long HAs experience. Conclusions: In children with homozygous GJB2 c.35delG pathogenic variants, application of CI before 12 or24 months of age brings similar outcome. Children with an unknown genetic cause of HL should be implanted before 12 months of age to achieve better results in auditorydevelopment. Further studies in the non DFNB1 group are planned to determine the link between genetic background of HL and the CI outcome. Supported by: NCN Grant 2017/27/N/NZ5/02369 D. Ozieblo: None. A.

Although a number of loci, candidate genes, and sequence variants have been identi ï¬ed in HM, the general genetic factor explaining the causes of HM has not beenspeciï¬ed. The aim of this study was to unravel the role of epigenetic changes in HM which could explain the relation between HM and environmental factors. Materials and Methods: In order to verify if the dysre gulated methylation of genes could contribute to the HM development, using a genome wide DNA methylationarray, we studied 18 Polish cases (aged 4 12 years, RE between 6.0 and 15.0 D) and 18 matched controls. CpGs with the highest fold change or the highest difference in themethylation level between cases and controls were ana lyzed. Pathway overrepresentation analyses among hyper methylated genes were performed using ConsensusPathDB. Results: In total, 1,541 CpGs, representing 1,745 genes, were hypermethylated ( â¥2.0 fold change, FDR p â¤0.05, ROC AUC â¥0.75) in HM subjects compared to controls. The most hypermethylated CpGs with more than 20% dif ference in the methylation level between cases and controls were located in TIMM50 ,RAB3C ,MICAL3 ,RWDD4A , XRCC2 , and FARP2 . Enrichment analysis of hypermethy lated myopia related genes set (>5 genes shared, p â¤0.01) revealed overrepresentation of genes from several path ways, including signal transduction, transcription, and sig naling pathways as receptor tyrosine kinases, JAK STAT, TGF beta, EGF EGFR.

However, IED diagnosticscan be compromised by poorly validated and curated tests. We aimed to develop and validate a high quality whole1228exome sequencing (WES) based platform and to assess diagnostic yield in a large IED cohort. Performance of the WES assay with bespoke clinical content, was tested through next generation sequencing (NGS) of reference samples using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. The assay was designed to cover clinically relevant intronic anddifï¬cult to sequence regions, and detect copy number variants (CNVs). Based on this assay, 23 ophthalmology gene panels were curated. The assay showed high averagesequencing depth (183x) and coverage (99.7% regions covered >20x), and uniform coverage over dif ï¬cult to sequence regions, including RPGR ORF15. Detection sensitivity was high for SNVs (0.998), INDELs (0.97), 1 exon CNVs (0.93) and 5 exon CNVs (0.99). The Usher Syndrome Panel gave the highest diagnostic yield (>80%).The most frequently ordered 266 gene Retinal Dystrophy Panel yielded a diagnosis in 58% (of 1587) cases. Diagnoses were made in a total of 111 genes, the mostcommon genes being ABCA4 ,USH2A, RPGR, RHO and PRPH2 , as well as in newly implicated IEDs genes, and in custom targeted deep intronic regions. Approximately 3%of patients had a diagnostic CNV. A WES assay with boosted clinical content provides high diagnostic yields for IED patients. The genetic variability of diagnoses in ourcohort supports the use of comprehensive NGS panels in IED diagnostics, to optimize diagnostic yield and clinical care. K. Wells: A.

One of the genes associated with IRD is PROM1 . Disease causing PROM1 variants have been associated with different phenotypes. The aim was to provide a detailed analysis of the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the PROM1 associated retinopathy in a large cohort of patients. Methods: PROM1 screening was performed using clas sical molecular techniques and/or targeted Next Generation Sequencing in a cohort of 2216 IRD families. Copy numbervariation analysis was carried out in unsolved monoallelic cases. Detailed ophthalmic evaluation was performed in 25 patients. Results: Thirty two families presented PROM1 variants, including likely pathogenic and unknown signi ï¬cance var iants, 10 of which are novel. Causative variants wereidenti ï¬ed in 21 families segregating in autosomal recessive (17) or dominant (4) pattern, 3 of them with founder effect. Phenotypic analysis in 25 patients carrying disease causingPROM1 variants revealed clinical heterogeneity regardless of genotype. Most of the patients suffered from cone rod dystrophy and some patients presented with macular dys trophy or retinitis pigmentosa, all presenting macular damage. Conclusions: Our study reports the largest and compre hensive description of genetic and clinical ï¬ndings in PROM1 retinopathy. The prevalence of PROM1 variants that seems to reliably explain the IRD phenotype in ourcohort is about 1%. This study also highlights the great heterogeneity of PROM1 associated phenotypes.

Although there are more than 55 MD genes, a considerable percentage of these cases remain unsolved. Methods: Whole exome sequencing of a cohort of IRD families was performed, analyzing a panel of 300 IRD genes in order to determine the genetic pathogenic cause. For some new mutations, functional analyzes were ruled out from patients blood samples. Results: Three new DRAM2 homozygous mutations were identi ï¬ed in three independent families: one frameshift and two splicing variants. All patients shared a singular phe notype, with an early macular involvement followed by aperipheral degeneration. However, the age of onset and the evolution of the pathology were different in each case. At a molecular level, functional studies revealed alterations ingene expression differing between patients. Conclusions: DRAM2 wasï¬rstly associated to IRD in 2015, and only scanty cases and 10 different pathogenicmutations have been reported to date. Thus, its function in the retina and the associated phenotypes are still much unknown. In this context, the results obtained signi ï¬cantly contribute to the comprehension of the role of this gene in the molecular bases of IRD, increasing the number and type of reported pathogenic variants and their functional effects,and strengthening the DRAM2 genotype phenotype corre lations in the retina.

However, mutations affecting genes in the nuclear genomemay strikingly resemble the clinical presentation of LHON. We conducted a study to de ï¬ne best testing strategy using next generation sequencing in bilateral optic atrophy andinconclusive family history. Here we report on 30 unrelated individuals referred to our institution for genetic testing because of the optic nerve atrophy and clinically suspectedLHON. None of the patients had lesions suggestive for multiple sclerosis on brain MRI. Genetic analysis consisted of mtDNA sequencing followed by clinical exome sequen cing. In two unrelated patients mtDNA sequencing identi ï¬ed typical LHON pathogenic variants (m.11778G>A, m.3700G>A). Exome sequencing in threeunrelated patients revealed OPA1 mutation (c.2489G>A, likely pathogenic variant), compound heterozygous muta tions in ACO2 (c.2253dupC, VUS and c.719G>C, patho genic variant) and a de novo mutation in WFS1 (c.2480C>T, likely pathogenic variant). Upon genetically guided clinical review, the last patient was found to exhibitsigns on macular OCT, typical for Wolfram syndrome. We found possible causative variants in 5 of 30 patients with bilateral optic atrophy and clinically suspected LHON. Inaddition to typical LHON mitochondrial variants we found causative variants associated with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and syndromic forms of optic neuro pathy and reclassi ï¬ed clinical diagnoses.

It has been reported in cases of aniridia, albinism, microphthalmia andachromatopsia. Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD), among which macular aplasia (MA), constitute a group of diseases characterized by clinical variability and pronounced geneticheterogeneity. By using IRD panel next generation sequen cing, we aimed to identify the disease causing mutation in a large Bulgarian pedigree with MA inherited in autosomal recessive pattern. Materials and Methods: A large pedigree with MA, most likely achromatopsia, accompanied by nystagmus anddecreased visual acuity presented from birth was recruited and DNA from the proband was sequenced using the Illu mina Â®platform and TruSight One sequencing panel. Protein coding and splice site variants were ï¬ltered in a panel with 341 genes related to retinal dystrophies. Results: Genetic analysis identi ï¬ed a homozygous mis sense variant c.2141T>A (p. Ile714Asn) in a conserved amino acid within the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the cone photoreceptor phosphodiesterase, PDE6C . The commonly used prediction tools classi ï¬ed the PDE6C c.2141T>A variant to be putatively damaging/deleterious. There is only one PDE6C c.2141A allele found in the Non Finnish European population suggesting an extremely low frequency for this change. Segregation study is in progress. Conclusions: We have identi ï¬ed a family affected by autosomal recessive dystrophy of the central photoreceptor system and found homozygous possibly pathogenic variant inPDE6C , mutations in which have been previously reported in patients with autosomal recessive inherited achromatopsia and early onset cone photoreceptor dys function.

MD has been describedmostly in sporadic cases, being familial cases around 10% of total observed cases. Between 20 45% of the cases have bilateral hearing loss. The aim of this study is to investigatethe burden of rare variants in SNHL genes in sporadic cases of MD. Methods: We designed a targeted sequencing panel including SNHL genes in supporting cells and sequenced 890 Spanish MD patients. The frequency of rare variants (with a MAF inferior to 0.1) in the gene panel was com pared with three independent datasets as controls for the gene burden analysis. Interaction model between rare and common variants is proposed for most relevant genes inMD cases. Results: Patients with sporadic MD showed a signi ï¬cant enrichment of missense variants in SNHL genes that wasnot found in the controls. The list of genes includes GJB2 , USH1G ,SLC26A4 ,ESRRB and CLDN14 . A rare synon ymous variant with unknown signi ï¬cance was found in the MARVELD2 gene in several unrelated patients with MD. Conclusions: There is a burden of rare variation in certain SNHL genes in sporadic MD. Furthermore, the interactionof common and rare variants in SNHL genes may have and additive effect on MD phenotype.

Familial aggregation is found in 10%of MD cases with autosomal dominant inheritance and several genes already described, such as DTNA ,FAM136A andSEMA3D genes. Thus, the goal of this study is to de ï¬ne new candidate genes for familial MD (FMD). Materials & Methods: We recruited 62 FMD cases to perform whole exome sequencing. Variant calling wasperformed with GATK. Candidate genes were prioritized based on pathogenicity using PhenIX. Single rare variant analysis (SRVA) focused on SNHL genes was performedusing MAF<0.001. Likewise, a gene burden analysis (GBA) with MAF<0.05 was performed to analyze the interaction of common and rare variants. We studied therelationship between rare and common variants which modulate gene expression. Results: Forty percent of FMD cases carried one novel or ultrarare likely pathogenic (CADD>15) variant in SNHL genes. Ninety four rare variants were selected from SRVA. A total of 222 rare variants were retrieved with GBAresulting in a high enrichment of variants in OTOF gene (corrected p value: 3x10 4). Four rare variants in our cohort showed a signi ï¬cant association with three common var iants regulating the expression of OTOF gene. Conclusions: There is a burden of rare variants in SNHL genes. Particularly, the interaction of rare and commonvariants in OTOF gene may play an important role in FMD.

30163,"ON, Canada,2Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, University ofToronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Introduction: North Carolina Macular Dystrophy (NCMD) is a high penetrance autosomal dominant inherited disease. The non coding SNPs in the linkage region on chromosome 6 fall within a DNase I hypersensitive site upstream ofPRDM13 and which regulates PRDM13 expression during development. This study aimed to understand the molecular basis of NCMD through differential expression analysis. Methods: PSSM scanning was used to predict changes in binding of known transcription factors in retina for the non coding variants on chromosome 6. RNA seq from skin derived RNA for three sibling pairs (affected/unaffected each) within a family was done for differential gene expression analysis. Results: These variants introduce a gain of binding sites for two important retinal transcription factors (PAX6 and OTX2) upstream of PRDM13. This can potentially alter thePRDM13 regulation in retinal tissue. RNA seq revealed ~50 differently expressed genes between the affected and unaf fected. Although we did not ï¬nd a direct association of these genes to the known genes involved in macular dys trophies, GO enrichment analysis showed ~30 statistically signiï¬cant processes with lipid metabolism being most signiï¬cant and it was previously linked to age related macular dystrophy. Conclusions: The introduction of PAX6 and OTX2 binding sites upstream of PRDM13 can potentially cause PRDM13 overexpression and may interfere with lipid metabolism and oxidative stress by increasing the amountof lipids in the retina.

Apart from the GJB2 gene, more than 100 genes responsible for NSHL and more than 400 genes associated with SHL are known. Currently, massive parallel sequen cing (MPS) is the optimal diagnostic method for non GJB2 related forms of hearing impairment. Materials and Methods: DNA samples of 205 Russian patients with NSHL (without mutations in GJB2 gene) and 10 patients with the incoming diagnosis of Pendred, Bran chiootorenal, Usher and Alstrom syndromes were tested byusing custom targeted MPS panel which includes 33 genes of NSHL and SHL. 25 DNA samples were searched for abnormal copy numbers with MLPA. Results: Among 205 patients with NSHL, pathogenic and probably pathogenic variants have been identi ï¬ed in 41 cases (20%) in following genes: STRC (10), USH2A (6), SLC26A4 (4), MYO7A (4), OTOF (4), POU3F4 (2), TECTA (2), TMPRSS3 (2), PTPRQ (1), ADGRV1 (1), TMC1 (1), LOXHD1 (1), ACTG1 (1), MYO15A (1), OTOA (1) . Diag nostic ef ï¬ciency in patients with SHL was 80% (8/10). In patients with NSHL, syndromic forms have been identi ï¬ed in 9% of total cases (18/205). The majority of causativemutations in STRC andOTOA were large CNVs (80% and 50%). Mutations c.11864G>A, c.2171_2174delTTTG, c.107A>C in USH2A, STRC, SLC26A4 genes are assumed to be frequent in Russian patients.

Results: Considering ongoing pregnancy, lack of patho genic changes and precise diagnosis in an affected boy, NGS sequencing of clinically relevant genes was performedwhich revealed a novel hemizygous substitution NM_000266.3( NDP _v001):c.385G>T, p.(Glu129*), in NDP gene associated with Norrie disease (OMIM#310600). Subsequent Sanger validation of the affected boy and his mother con ï¬rmed identi ï¬ed substitution inherited in X linked recessive mode. Amniotic ï¬uid testing revealed the fetus is hemizygous for the variant. Complications were developed during subsequent interruption of pregnancy driven by medical necessity. Conclusions: Clinical polymorphism of hereditary oph thalmic pathology could severely complicate the establish ment of exact diagnosis and make it time and cost consuming. NGS appears to be the method of choice in complicated cases which could substantially hasten the establishment of diagnosis and genetic risk estimation. Supported by RFBR grant â19 015 00122. A. V.

The most common mutated gene in OCA is TYROSINASE (TYR) . Currently, no data available on the frequency or molecular background of Albinism in Turkey. Materials and Methods: Forty OCA patients (23 male and 17 female, 3 pairs of siblings) with a median age 19.2 years (min: 6mo max 70.1 years) were enrolled. Following DNA isolation, the coding regions of TYR genes were analysed by PCR and direct sequencing. Results: We have detected 28 different TYR variations in 31(77.5%, 17 homozygous, 16 compound heterozygous and1 heterozygous) of the OCA patients (Table1). The most frequent variants were c.815G>A, p. Trp272* and c.741C>A, p. Cyc247* with an allele frequency of 0.06.Among 28 variations ï¬ve of them were novel (Table 1). The allele frequencies of two common TYR polymorphisms S192Y and R402Q were 34% and 14.6% respectfully. Conclusion: TYR gene is commonly mutated in OCA patients in Turkey. The patient with only heterozygous TYR variant, addition to other 8 patients with no variation shouldbe evaluated for other related genes. Further studies with new patients and investigation of other melanin related genes in TYR negative patients are ongoing. Table 1: TYR variations and their allele frequencies detected in our patients.

30167,"1MRC Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands,2Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands Introduction: X linked cone dysfunction disorders such as Blue Cone Monochromacy and Cone Dystrophy are caused by pathogenic variants and rearrangements in OPN1LW and OPN1MW which share more than 98% sequence similarity. Located in tandem, they are susceptible to meiotic mispairing, unequal homologous and nonhomologousrecombination. This might lead to different copy numbers ofOPN1LW and/or OPN1MW or the formation of hybrid opsin genes. Because of the frequent exchange, Xchromosomes have around one to ï¬veOPN1MW copies, whereas they rarely have more than one OPN1LW copy. Using the current diagnostic tests, it remains dif ï¬cult to determine the copy number and presence of gene rearrangements in OPN1LW andOPN1MW . Methods: A novel multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ï¬cation (MLPA) assay was developed and tested on 14 patient samples with a known copy number status of OPN1LW andOPN1MW . Copy number and rearrangements inOPN1LW andOPN1MW were analysed in more than 100 DNA samples.1234Results: The copy number of OPN1LW andOPN1MW was con ï¬rmed in the 14 patients and could be easily determined in 75 male and female DNA samples and in 45 clinical samples consisting of affected individuals and car riers. Ten patients with hybrid opsin genes were identi ï¬ed, including one patient with two hybrid genes. Conclusion: The newly developed MLPA assay enables determination of the copy number status and identi ï¬cation of gene rearrangements in OPN1LW and OPN1MW . The addition of MLPA to routine sequencing of OPN1LW and OPN1MW will improve detection of the cause of X linked cone dysfunction disorders. A. S. Hoekstra: A.

To date, all reports of TMEM126A mutations are from patients of Maghrebian origin, who all carry an identical nonsense mutation. We report two novel variants in the TMEM126A gene from two non Maghreb patients/families, both resulting in an arOA phenotype. The proband of family A was diagnosed with visual loss in early childhood but a diagnosis of optic atrophy was onlymade at 14 years. A diagnostic gene panel revealed a splice donor variant (c.86 +2T>C) in the TMEM126A gene. Ana lysis of this variant based on RNA from whole bloodrevealed a single aberrant transcript lacking exon 2, pre sumably representing a functional null allele. Two siblingsfrom family B were diagnosed with optic atrophy in early childhood. A missense variant (p. S36L) in the TMEM126A gene was identi ï¬ed in a gene panel based diagnostic setting in both siblings. This missense variant is ultra rare in the general population, affects a highly evolutionarily con served amino acid and segregates with the disease withinthe family. The three probands reported in this study had a relatively mild clinical course without any evidence of a syndromic (e.g. neurological) comorbidity, which is in linewith previous studies. We provide additional evidence for the implication of biallelic TMEM126A mutations in arOA. Our ï¬ndings extend both the mutational spectrum and geographic pre sence of TMEM126A in arOA. N.

Isolated and syndromic forms are described. The most frequent ION are autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), due toOPA1 variant, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), caused by mitochondrial DNA variant. Materials and Methods: Herein we report on three patients from a family suffering from bilateral optic neu ropathy and suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance. Two of them show additional features such as speech delay,mild learning disabilities and behavior disorders. The sequencing of a panel of ION âs genes including the OPA1 gene is normal. The SNP array analysis reveals an 82 kbintragenic heterozygous deletion of the SOX5 gene that segregates with the disease. Discussion: The SOX5 haploinsuf ï¬ciency leads to Lamb Shaffer syndrome classically associating global develop mental delay, with predominant speech impairment, mild toAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1235severe intellectual disability and mild dysmorphic features. Some patients have additional features such as brain abnormalities or musculoskeletal anomalies. Optic atrophy is described in only two patients carrying SOX5 hetero zygous de novo variants: a 53 kb intragenic deletion and a point variant resulting in a premature stop codon. These twopatients displayed a moderate to severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Conclusion: Here we report on the ï¬rst family of inherited autosomal dominant optic atrophy due to SOX5 heterozygous deletion associated with mild neurodevelop mental features. This observation suggests that a SOX5 gene analysis could be performed in patients presenting with optic atrophy associated with developmental disorder even mild. A. Gouronc: None. Y. Perdomo: None.

A previously conducted molecular genetic study of a large cohort of Russian patients with AN revealedseveral groups of PAX6 nucleotide variants which patho genicity is not obvious, including variants out of canonical splicing site dinucleotides, possibly affecting splicing, and5Ê¹ UTR variants. These variants were classi ï¬ed as VUS or likely pathogenic according to the ACMG recommenda tions. Thus, to validate the pathogenicity of such variantsfunctional studies are required. Materials and Methods: To determine the effect of PAX6 variants on splicing we used a minigene assay. To study 5 Ê¹ UTR variants we generated luciferase constructs with full length PAX6 5Ê¹ UTR (wt and mutants). The translation ef ï¬ciency was measured by luciferase assay, and the RNA expression level was evaluated by qPCR. Results: Using a minigene assay, seven out of eight investigated probably affecting slicing variants (six deepintronic and two exonic) were showed to disrupt normal splicing patterns and result in frame shifting followed bymRNA degradation by NMD mechanism. Besides, ï¬ve 5 Ê¹ UTR variants were found to lead to a signi ï¬cant decrease in the translation ef ï¬ciency, including three of them, which also lead to aberrant splicing. Our further analysis allows us to suggest the mechanism of 5 Ê¹ UTR variants pathogenicity through disruption of upstream ORF which possibly existsinPAX6 5Ê¹ UTR. Conclusions: Using functional analysis we have con ï¬rmed the pathogenicity of 12 PAX6 noncoding mutations. Moreover, our results suggest the exact mechanism of their pathogenic action. A.

Despite huge efforts in genes discovery, almost half of patients still fail toreceive a molecular diagnosis. Methods: Two unrelated ADNSHL families of European ancestry negative for mutations in known deafness genesunderwent next generation sequencing. Data were ï¬ltered according to frequency, pathogenicity and pattern of inheritance. To prioritize genes a population based analysiswas performed (including statistics on natural selection in Europeans and gene constrains from gnomAD database) followed by in silico protein modelling. Results: Among the genes found mutated in the two analysed families, interestingly, PLS1 showed signatures of natural selection and low observed/expected ratio of bothmissense and loss of function mutations. Thus, these ï¬nd ings suggested a level of conservation and allowed to prioritize PLS1 in which two novel likely pathogenic mis sense variants were identi ï¬ed. PLS1 encodes ï¬mbrin, one of the most abundant actin bundling proteins of the stereocilia.1236Recently, it was demonstrated that Pls1 / mice show a moderate/progressive form of HL across all frequencies (PMID: 25124451). In silico protein modelling displayed that both variants affect the actin binding domain 1, and suggested an overall destabilization of the protein structure, reducing the protein âs ability to bind F actin. Conclusion: Present results (genomic data of two inde pendent ADNSHL families, literature updates, evidence of evolutionary constrains and protein modelling results) pro vide evidence that PLS1 is required for normal hearing and once mutated might cause ADNSHL. The identi ï¬cation of PLS1 as a new ADNSHL gene provides a new possible target for the development of therapeutic approaches. A. Morgan: None. D. Koboldt: None. E. Barrie: None. E. Crist: None. M.

Methods: Case report of a 30 year old male with a family history of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy type 3 (PPCD3) was invited for ophthalmic examination. Sanger sequencing of the coding regions and intron/exon bound aries of disease associated genes, ZEB1 andUBIAD1 was performed. Results: The clinical ï¬ndings suggested co occurrence of PPCD3 and Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD) in the pro band. This dual diagnosis was supported by genetic ï¬ndings. He was identi ï¬ed to carry a previously reported heterozygous nonsense mutation in ZEB1 ; c.2157C>G, p.(Tyr719*), and a novel heterozygous missense mutation in UBIAD1 ; c.569T>C; p.(Ile190Thr). The mother of the proband onlycarried the c.2157C>G ZEB1 variant and slit lamp examina tion of her corneas showed endothelial lesions characteristic of PPCD3. The sister of the proband carried the c.569T>C inUBIAD1 and had corneal crystal deposition in her anterior stroma consistent with the diagnosis of SCD. Conclusion: This case illustrates the coincidental occur rence of two rare and genetically distinct corneal dystro phies in a single patient. Furthermore, it highlights the needto perform comprehensive phenotyping in combination with appropriate genetic diagnostic testing to achieve an accurate diagnosis.

Patients and Methods: molecular analysis of 26 children of 21 families with PCG was performed. First we examinedthe common mutation p. Glu387Lys of CYP1B1 gene using RFLP technique. In cases where wild type or heterozygous p. Glu387Lys variant was detected, Sanger sequencing ofCYP1B1 was performed. Common p. Arg299Ter (c.895C>T) mutation in LTBP2 gene was also genotyped. We carried out a retrospective evaluation, using clinical dataas follows: age at diagnosis, ophthalmological status, pre and postoperative visual acuity and intraocular pressure and pedigree. Results: we identi ï¬ed two mutations in 20 patients (76,92%) in our study group. The p. Arg299Ter (c.895C>T) mutation in LTBP2 gene was found in one family in homozygous form.

Other early onset, developmental glaucomasmay arise secondary to developmental malformations of the anterior segment of the eye, and occur as part of an anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) disorder. Consequently, theseoverlapping phenotypes may challenge the diagnosis of PCG. Here we studied a highly consanguineous Jordanian pedigree with over 17 affected individuals in three gen erations, displaying a clinical diagnosis of PCG. In addition to PCG, the proband also presented with iris atrophy,ectropion uveae and corectopia. Moreover, the familial history revealed the presence of other ocular manifestations in the family including cataracts, lens luxation and irisabnormalities. Using homozygosity based ï¬ltering of exome data, we identi ï¬ed a homozygous frameshift variant in CPAMD8: c.785_788del, p. Tyr262Serfs*17. This variantis not present in population databases and segregates with the phenotype in the family. Recently, CPAMD8 was reported as the cause for a unique autosomal recessive ASDthat is characterized by bilateral iris hypoplasia, ectopia lentis, corectopia, ectropion uveae, and cataracts, clinical features also observed here. Interestingly, two affectedsiblings who were initially diagnosed with PCG received a clinical diagnosis of megalocornea in retrospect. In con clusion, we identi ï¬ed the molecular cause underlying a PCG phenotype in a large consanguineous family using combined homozygosity mapping and WES. Based on thisfamily and the previously reported families, CPAMD8 associated ASD should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis for PCG. H. Verdin: None. I. Balikova: None. J.

We are using wholeexome sequencing (WES) of ï¬ve large, complex families from Tasmania (Australia) and Oregon (USA) to identify susceptibility genes for primary open angle glaucoma(POAG), the leading cause of irreversible blindness world wide. Extended pedigrees, enriched for POAG, provide a powerful tool to search for rare and private genetic variantsinï¬uencing the disease, where enrichment of rare variants occurs as a function of segregation from the founders. The families in this study range in size from 48 to 201individuals (28 to 91 sequenced) and span 5 to 7 generations. These families are being used to locate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for intraocular pressure(IOP), an important glaucoma endophenotype. Variance components linkage analysis of IOP was conducted on the WES data from 249 individuals and we identi ï¬ed QTLs on chromosomes 2,3,6,7 and 15. The chromosome 2 locus (2q22.2 24.3) spans a 20 million base pair region. Three of theï¬ve families independently contribute linkage informa tion to this peak, which is a novel locus for both IOP and POAG. Further analysis is being undertaken to identify genes with family speci ï¬c, potentially deleterious variants; which will be validated in large POAG case/control cohorts. Finding genes involved with POAG susceptibility will increase our understanding of the biological pathwaysinvolved with the disease process and from that, diagnostic tools and more effective treatments can be developed.

One of the variants we identi ï¬ed has already been reported with a phenotype similar to our patient âs, whereas the other three were unknown. The clinical and biochemical information we provide will hopefully contribute to gain insight into the correlation between genotype and phenotype in this rarecondition, in females as well as in males. Moreover, our observation of a new family in which hemizygous males display hearing loss without any neurological or ophthal mological symptoms prompts us to suggest analysing PRPS1 in cases of isolated hearing loss.

Here, exome sequencing in a European cohort with inherited retinal disease (IRD) (n,2086) revealed biallelic RAX2 sequence and structural variants in ï¬ve unrelated European index cases, displaying non syndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP) with an age of onset ranging from childhood to themid 40s (average mid 30s). Protein structure modeling of the novel recessive missense variants points to loss of function while a dominant negative effect is predicted forthe previously reported dominant RAX2 alleles. Structural variants were ï¬ne mapped to disentangle their underlying mechanisms and haplotyping of c.335dup in two casessuggests a common Belgian ancestry. One additional unrelated Belgian ARRP patient carried the same c.335dup allele in the absence of a second RAX2 coding or structural variant, suggesting a role for non coding variants in RAX2 associated ARRP. To conclude, we found biallelic pathogenic variants in RAX2 to be associated with ARRP, revealing RAX2 as a novel gene for recessively inherited rod dominated retinal diseases. The identi ï¬cation ofRAX2 biallelic pathogenic variants in ï¬ve families of European origin indicates that this gene may underlie a non negligible fraction of ARRP cases of other populations that still lack a molecular diagnosis. The RAX2 mutational spectrum was broadened from sequence to structural variants (SVs). Finally, the identi ï¬cation of pathogenic structural variants in RAX2 stresses the importance of SV assessment in WES and WGS data in IRD.

30178,"1University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada,2The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada Introduction: Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is rare auto somal recessive disorder, characterized by retinal degenera tion, obesity, digital anomalies, genito urinary defects, and variable cognitive impairment. It is part of a broader pleotropic class of diseases called ciliopathies. Ciliopathiesare caused by mutations in genes that play important roles in the function of cellular signaling organelles called cilia. BBS10 encodes a chaperonin âlike protein that mediates assembly of the BBSome, which transports vesicles to cilia. BBS10 is one of the most frequently mutated BBS genes, accounting for approximately 16% of cases. Methods: A 29 yo female from a consanguineous family had non syndromic cone rod dystrophy (CRD) and did not have any mutation identi ï¬ed using standard of care clinical genetic testing. Whole exome sequencing was performed. Candidate variants were assessed based on family segre gation, predicted effect on protein structure and function,amino acid conservation, and population frequency. Results: Whole genome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous mutation in BBS10 . The variant is rare and segregated in the family. It occurs at a residue which is highly conserved among chaperonins. Based on modelling of BBS10 secondary structure, it is predicted that the variantcould 1) affect multimer assembly or 2) alter how ATP hydrolysis induces the protein conformation changes that are vital to chaperone function. Conclusions: We have identi ï¬ed a rare homozygous variant we presume signi ï¬cant in BBS10 in a patient with non syndromic CRD. We are exploring the functionalconsequences of the variant through phenotyping a patient derived ï¬broblast cell line. Funding: FFB, Mira Godard, McLaughlin Centre, ORF A. V. Vig: None. E.

Alastalo1 1Blueprint Genetics, Helsinki, Finland,2Helsinki University Eye Hospital, Helsinki, Finland Retinal dystrophies (RD) are disorders that damage the photoreceptors in the retina and cause visual impairment. Prompt, comprehensive genetic diagnosis of RD can assist in risk assessment, symptom management and selection of the appropriate targeted treatment. The genetic testing needs to take into account sequence alterations and copy number variants (CNVs). We evaluated the rates and characteristics of CNVs in 2754 patients tested using a comprehensiveRD panel. DNA from patients was sequenced by targeted OS Seq using the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencing platform or theIDT xGEN Exome Research Panel using the Illumina NovaSeq platform. CNVs were detected by CNVkit and an in house developed deletion caller. CNVs in 47 genes matching the patient âs phenotype were reported in 4.6% of the cases. Of the CNVs, 71.1% were partial gene deletions, 13.3% whole gene deletions, 3.1%one exon deletions, and 0.8% partial exon deletions. 11.7% of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were duplications (partial or whole gene). 88.3% of CNVs were likely pathogenic or patho genic, 11.7% were variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance. Of the likely pathogenic and pathogenic CNVs, 73.4% were diagnostic. USH2A and PRPF31 were enriched in CNVs compared to other genes. Notably, CNVs were identi ï¬ed also in genes in which CNVs are not commonly reported, e.g. ABCA4 andRPE65 . These results highlight the importance of comprehensive genetic testing for the diagnosis of retinal dystrophies. We identi ï¬ed CNVs ranging from one exon to whole gene deletions in multiple genes. In addition, we detected a relative high percentage of copy number duplications that warrant further investigation. L. Guidugli: A. Employment (full or part time); Sig niï¬cant; Blueprint Genetics.

Myllykangas1 1Blueprint Genetics, Helsinki, Finland,2Helsinki University Eye Hospital, Helsinki, Finland Introduction: The exon ORF15 in RPGR is a mutational hotspot for X linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). How ever, it generally performs poorly in standard sequencing based assays due to a highly repetitive purine rich sequence. To address the clinical importance of RPGR ORF15 and the lack of high quality next generation sequencing (NGS) based diagnostics, we aimed to develop a comprehensiveclinical test for inherited retinal dystrophies. Materials and Methods: We optimized a whole exome sequencing work ï¬ow with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform to cover 266 retinal dystrophy associated genes, including the dif ï¬cult to sequence region in RPGR ORF15. We evaluated the performance of RPGR sequencing in 1587 unselected patient samples. Results: In our clinical cohort, the overall diagnostic yield was 58%. A molecular diagnosis in RPGR was identi ï¬ed in 5.7% (90/1587) of the patients. The 90 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants consisted of 63 fra meshift (70.0%), 21 nonsense (23.3%), three missense(3.3%), and two consensus splice site (2.2%) variants, and one gross deletion (1.1%). Seventy one out of 90 (79%) pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in theORF15, of which 28 (39%) were in the dif ï¬cult to sequence central region between residues p.824 and p.1077. Female patients accounted for 24% of the diagnostic cases. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of RPGR ORF15 sequencing in retinal dystrophy patients. The high quality NGS based assay enables rapid and reliablemolecular diagnostics of RPGR ORF15, and enhances the identi ï¬cation of patients for ongoing gene therapy trials. J. Sistonen: A.

Recent advancements in targeted therapyhave incentivised genetic diagnostics and increased the efforts to identify RPE65 patients eligible for therapy. We evaluated the prevalence of RPE65 variants in 2240 retinal dystrophy patients by using next generation sequencing (NGS). Methods: Patients with LCA, RP, rod cone dystrophy, or early onset retinal dystrophy were tested at a CLIA certi ï¬ed laboratory 2016 2018. Analysis was done using in house developed and validated NGS, bioinformatics and clinicalinterpretation.1242Results: Of 18 patients (0.8%) with RPE65 related dis ease, 7 (38.8%) had LCA, 4 (22.2%) had RP, 6 (33.3%) were affected with severe early onset retinal dystrophy, and one (5.5%) had congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). The median age at molecular diagnosis was 13 years (range 1 60 years). Of the 35 disease associatedRPE65 variants 18 (51%) were missense, 10 (29%) protein truncating, 5 (13%) splice site variants, and 2 (5.7%) copy number variants (CNVs). Two (11.1%) patients carried aCNV: a single exon deletion and a deletion of the whole RPE65 gene, respectively. Twelve (67%) patients had at least one loss of function variant. One patient had thec.1430A>G, p.(Asp477Gly) variant associated with auto somal dominant disease and displayed an atypical form of RP. Conclusions: RPE65 has a signi ï¬cant role in LCA and is important in differential diagnostics of retinal dystrophies. Our results also highlight the importance of high qualitygenetic diagnostics covering both sequence variants and CNVs for optimized diagnosis and clinical care. J. Tommiska: A.

We developed an NGS targeted gene panel of 59 genes using the Ion Torrent PGM TMplatform combined with a customized bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of DNA samples from clinically highly selected subjects with sensorineural hearing loss, negative for GJB2 mutations/ GJB6 deletions. Among the 158 subjects tested, 64 were found to carry pathogenic variants (41%) that in 18 cases (28%) altered genes involved both in NSHL and Ushersyndrome ( ADGRV1, CDH23, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, USH2A ); 13 of these subjects were under 15 years of age and were largely referred for NSHL. 7/18 positive subjectscarried mutation in CDH23 , the most frequently mutated gene in our cohort. We achieved a diagnosis of Usher syndrome type I in three subjects (3 y.o.; 6 y.o.; 16 y.o.)with congenital profound hearing loss, retinal anomalies/ retinitis pigmentosa and/or history of motor delay, who carried mutations in CDH23, MYO7A andPCDH15 . Usher syndrome type II was diagnosed in a 12 y.o. boy referred for congenital bilateral mild hearing loss and subsequently found to have early signs of retinal alteration. 13 novellikely pathogenic mutations were identi ï¬ed in NSHL/Usher genes; 1 splice site mutation has been further characterized at the RNA level.

Visceral myopathy is char acterized by impaired intestinal function and motility resulting in severe abdominal pain, malnutrition and evendeath. Inter and intrafamilial variability is present. Diagnostic criteria include absence of mechanical obstruc tion and histological examination of intestinal biopsies. Materials and Methods: We report a 10 year old boy referred to Oulu university hospital in March 2016 due to pseudo obstruction of the small intestine. Previously, per sistent ductus arteriosus was closed operatively and diag nosis of functional growth hormone disturbance was placed. He had suffered from periodic abdominal pain, vomitingand slow weight gain from infancy. His clinical picture was severe and he was completely dependent on parental nutrition. Clinical suspicion of visceral myopathy wasaroused. Results: Deletion/duplication analysis of ACTG2 identi ï¬ed a heterozygous likely pathogenic deletion encompass ing the entire ACTG2 . Chromosomal microarray showed a heterozygous microdeletion 2p13.1 of 84 kb including the exons 2 9 of ACTG2 and entire DGUOK . The deletion was not identi ï¬ed in the parents and thus, was considered de novo .Conclusions: We identi ï¬ed a novel heterozygous dele tion of ACTG2 explaining the patient âs phenotype. Muta tions in ACTG2 cause visceral myopathy. The microdeletion also included DGUOK . Mutations in DGUOK lead to autosomal recessive deoxyguanosine kinase de ï¬ciency causing neurological symptoms and liver dysfunction. No other pathogenic mutations were identi ï¬ed inDGUOK .

While most (80%) AS cases are X linked, approximately 15% and 5% areautosomal recessive or dif ï¬cult to differentiate from thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) dominant forms. Digenic inheritance among COL4A3 COL4A5 or their concomitance with other glomerulopathy or chronic kidney disease (CKD) related genes, has been recently proposed to explain the variable phenotypic expression andincomplete penetrance frequently observed in AS patients.1244Materials and Methods: NGS analysis of 55 glomer ulopathy and CKD related genes was performed in a group of 56 unrelated Polish patients with suspected AS. Results: In all patients clinical diagnosis was con ï¬rmed at the molecular level. Overall, 17 known and 32 novel, likely pathogenic alterations in COL4A3 COL4A5 were identi ï¬ed. The inheritance was X linked in 73% of cases, remaining 9% autosomal recessive and 18% were dominant AS/TBMN. Changes were randomly distributed across allCOL4A3 COL4A5 coding regions, however we revealed a recurrent COL4A5 variant c.1871G>A in twelve patients. Additionally, four patients with this alteration had likelypathogenic variant in COL4A3 ,HNF1B orMYH9 , which may modify disease âs severity. Conclusions: The results of this study broaden the gen otypic spectrum of AS, which will facilitate future research on the genotype phenotype correlations. Multiple gene sequencing is an effective approach to obtain geneticinformation in AS, particularly about the mode of inheri tance which is important for counselling and may help to predict the clinical course, especially for those patients withmild, non speci ï¬c or atypical phenotype.

All affected individuals develop renal failure, usually as young adults. Carriers of a single autosomal mutation develop Thin Basement Membrane Nephropathy (TBMN) associated with âbenign familial haematuria â. We analysed a cohort of 119 individuals (29 probands and 85 relatives identi ï¬ed by cascade testing) with heterozygous mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4 identi ï¬ed by Next Generation Sequencing and assessed genotype/phenotype correlations. 70% had hae maturia, 38% developed proteinuria, 21% had chronic kidney disease and 10% reached end stage renal disease. 36% of our cohort had a single mutation in COL4A4 c.2906C>G p.(Ser969Ter), representing 18% of cases of proteinuria. 50% of these patients developed proteinuria compared with 31% of patients with other mutations. Therisk of eGFR falling below 60ml/min increased from 6% to 8% in patients with the COL4A4c.2906C>G p.(Ser969Ter) mutation. Single COL4A3/4 mutations are recognised sus ceptibility factors for developing proteinuria, hypertension and renal disease in later life, but these risks have pre viously not been quanti ï¬ed. It is recommended that all patients with a single COL4A3/4 mutation should have annual checks of blood pressure and urine, with a low threshold for prescribing an ACE inhibitor, and this isimportant for those with the high risk genotype. In conclusion, this is the largest study ever performed of the implications of carrying a single autosomal COL4A3/4 mutation and our ï¬ndings clarify the risk of renal disease in this population. A.

Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1245ARPKD is primaly caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene, nevertheless, phenotype of polycystic kidneys clinically resembling ARPKD can be caused by mutations in number of other genes, such as HNF1 Î², PKD1, PKD2, NPHP etc. Thus, the molecular genetic analysis can be very useful in differential diagnosis of ARPKD in patient. Theresults of molecular genetic analysis in eleven patients with clinically suspected ARPKD, who did harbor mutations in other genes than PKHD1, are presented. Materials and Methods: The molecular analysis was carried out using next generation sequencing method with enrichment capture based and amplicon based library pre paration. The panel of approximately 80 genes associated with the formation of polycystic kidneys was analyzed. Results: The most frequent mutations found in our group of patients were variants in the TMEM67 gene (5 patients). In three patients, mutation in PKD1 was detected (in one patient in combination with PKHD1 mutation in trans). Twopatients harbored combination of two mutations: (1) muta tion in PKHD1 and TMEM237, (2) PKHD1 mutation and deletion of 3 exons in the NPHP3 gene. In one patient,deletion of whole HNF1 Î²gene was identi ï¬ed. Conclusions: Because of an etiologic heterogeneity of polycystic kidney disease phenotype, the complex muta tional analysis, encompassing analysis in other genes (especially TMEM67), should be used for reliable differ ential diagnosis.

FOXP1 syndrome is characterized by autistic traits, such as social de ï¬cits, language impairment, and intellectual disability. But feeding dif ï¬culties, constipation, and other GI problems were also reported. Whether these symptoms are due to primary impairment or a secondary effect of altered behaviour or side effects of psychotropic medication remains unclear. We investigated the GI tract of patient relevant Foxp1 +/ mice. These mice have a lower body weight than wild type animals and show altered feeding behaviour. Foxp1 was expressed in all GI sections and was reduced in Foxp1+/ mice compared with WT. A pronounced atrophy of the tunica muscularis was detected in the oesophagus and colon, caused by reduced muscle cell proliferation. Nitricoxide induced relaxation of the lower oesophagus sphincter was impaired and achalasia con ï¬rmed in vivo by mano metry. Several Foxp1 targets previously identi ï¬ed by microarray analysis in the brain were signi ï¬cantly deregu lated in the oesophagus of Foxp1 +/ mice. The total gut transit was signi ï¬cantly prolonged. Spatiotemporal maps depicting the colonic contraction patterns revealed strongly disturbed contractility and peristalsis. Overall, our ï¬ndings provide the ï¬rst evidence that GI disturbances in patients with FOXP1 autism spectrum disorder may be caused by impaired gut motility and achalasia, driven by FOXP1 dependent deregulation of genes. Furthermore, this is theï¬rst report of achalasia being caused by a heterozygous gene deletion. H. FrÃ¶hlich: None. M. Kollmeyer: None. M. Stuhlin ger: None. V. Linz: None. D. Groneberg: None. A.

Previous genome wide asso ciation studies (GWASs) have identi ï¬edHLA DR/DQ as the predominant risk factors of childhood SSNS. Our groupreported the ï¬rst GWAS for childhood SSNS in Japanese. Genome wide signi ï¬cant associations were identi ï¬ed in1246HLA DR/DQ region and disease associated HLA alleles and haplotypes were further clari ï¬ed (J Am Soc Nephrol , 2018). To identify other loci contributing to susceptibility to childhood SSNS, especially in non HLA regions, we performed an extended GWAS with a larger number of samples. Discovery stage including 897 patients withchildhood onset SSNS and 2,807 adult healthy controls was carried out in the Japanese population, genotyped using Affymetrix âJaponica Array â. Whole genome imputation was conducted using a phased reference panel of 2,049 healthy Japanese individuals (2KJPN panel). Quality control was performed to exclude the samples with lowcalling rate (<97%) and the variants with low genotyping rate (<97%), minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.5% and Handy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test p value <1Ã10 5. Association analysis was conducted using logistic regres sion with the adjustment of gender and principal compo nents. In this discovery GWAS, the most signi ï¬cant association was detected in HLA DR/DQ region as we reported before (P ,2.98Ã10 32, odds ratio (OR) ,0.34).

The parents are cousins and have 7 children. 3 boys and 1 girl show Cockaine syndrome (OMIM #216400) and 3 children (1 girland 2 boys) show Fanconi Bickels symptoms (OMIM#227810) linked to GLUT2 de ï¬ciency. Two boys are affected by both Cockaine and GLUT2 de ï¬ciency. Fanconi Bickels syndrome is related to SLC2A2 muta tions (3q26) and glucose transporter protein 2 (GLUT2) defect. The typical clinical picture is characterized by hepatorenal glycogen accumulation resulting in hepato andnephromegaly. In this family the patients with SLC2A2 mutation show growth retardation, major hepatomegaly and renal failure. The homozygous mutation is intronic: lVS9 1g>a /IVS9 1g>a. In Cockaine syndrome, 2 genes are affected ERCC6 and ERCC8 . Here a new homozygous pathogenic variation has been identi ï¬ed in ERCC8 (5q12.1): c.730C>T (exon 9) (Calmel N et al .Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2016 ).ERCC8 encodes the CSA protein involved in DNA repair. Thepatients aging 15 to 28 years in the family show neonatal photosensibility, growth retardation, dysmorphic features, lypoatrophy, intellectual de ï¬ciency, late onset deafness and tremor. The RRS test (Recovery RNA synthesis after DNA damage) was altered and UDS test (unscheduled DNA synthesis) was normal.

Con genital hyperinsulinism as the presenting feature of KS, wasdescribed in 10 affected individuals. The gene KDM6A is responsible for KS in approximately 5% of patients. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1247KDM6A mosaicism was reported in at least one patient with typical KS manifestations . Case report: A 20 month old girl diagnosed with iso lated, persistent congenital hyperinsulinism responsive only to Diazoxide treatment. She has no dysmorphic features, normal development, and no structural anomalies. Mole cular Analysis of the coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of 16 genes responsible for congenital hyper insulinism was performed on a clinical basis by targetednext generation sequencing. A mosaic pathogenic variant in the gene KDM6A c.514C>T p. Arg172Ter was detected in at least 20%. of the cells. No other variants were identi ï¬ed. Discussion: It has been suggested previously that female patients with KDM6A mutations have milder phenotypes than males.

Its clinical course varies from small thoracic effusions to life â threatening thoracic compression and secondary hydropsfetalis. Primary CCT result from malformations of the thoracic lymphoid system, secondary CCT result from cardiac anomalies or in ï¬ammatory disease. Previous studies suggest underlying genetic causes and found several genes to be mutated in some patients with lymphatic disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate new genetic driversfor primary CCT. Methods: We applied whole exome sequencing (WES) in two affected sibling pairs and their healthy parents. Toidentify disease causing variants we applied standardized ï¬ltering of WES data. First, we ï¬ltered for autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant novel variants. Second,the predicted deleteriousness and the conservation of the mutations was controlled. Third, further research on thecandidate genes was done to specify the functional effects of the mutations. The variants found in potential candidate genes were validated and segregated by re sequencing. After prioritisation of the best candidate gene, re sequencing of this candidate gene in a cohort of 30 spora dic cases is warranted. Results: Theï¬ltering of WES data identi ï¬ed four rare homozygous variants in ZNF512 (p. His90Arg), SMC6 (p. Thr679Met), BRE (p. Ser11Cys) and GCKR (p. Arg149Lys).

Unless a timely treatment is introduced, CH causes mentalretardation and growth delay. More than 10 causative genes have been described for the pathogenesis of inherited CH to date. In this study we investigated a Mendelian cause of CHin a consanguineous family with 2 affected children. Both cases showed short stature, mental retardation and bone age retardation. Next generation sequencing analysis of 16candidate CH genes identi ï¬ed a homozygous nonsense change (p. R516*, c.1546C>T) in the S LC5A5 gene (NM_000453.2) in both cases. We con ï¬rmed the presence of this variant by Sanger sequencing and both parents and the unaffected sibling carried this variant at heterozygous state, underlying the co segregation of the variant with the disease status in the family. Moreover, this variant was not present in 400 ethnically matched control chromosomes. p. R516* variant in the S LC5A5 gene is not currently listed as a mutation in clinical databases. Since (i) it introduces a premature stop codon in the gene; (ii) co segregates with the disease status in the family and (iii) is not present in 400ethnically matched control chromosomes, here we report it as a novel mutation causing congenital hypothyroidism.1248F.

The clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from most severe,to mild forms depending on the degree of 21 hydroxylase activity. Materials and Methods: Seventy one cases (69 referred for CAH and 2 for prenatal diagnosis), as well as 29 siblings of carriers/patients with CAH, were tested for CYP21A2 gene mutations. Long range PCR was employed to selec tively amplify the CYP21A2 gene against its pseudogene, followed by Sanger sequencing. MLPA analysis was undertaken for samples with an indication of duplication/deletion of the gene. Results: Thirty patients with CAH were compound het erozygotes or homozygotes, while forty were heterozygotesforCYP21A2 gene mutations. One of the prenatal cases was compound heterozygote, while the other was simple het erozygote for CYP21A2 gene mutations. The most common mutations detected were as follows: p. V281L (25%), p. P30L (14%), I2 Splice Site (10%), p. I172N (4%), p. Q318X (2%), p. P482S (3%), p. P453S (13%) and *13G>A 3' UTR(7%). Four parents with no clinical symptoms were found to be compound heterozygotes for the non classic form of CAH. Eight samples harbored genomic rearrangements inone or both alleles of the gene. Conclusion: Molecular analysis of the CYP21A2 gene is essential for proper management of patients with CAH dueto 21 hydroxylase de ï¬ciency, as well as for genetic coun seling and prenatal diagnosis.

30195,"Objective: This study aimed primarily to establish a rapid and high throughput genetic test for syndromic disorders ofsex development (DSD). Meanwhile, the applicability and effectiveness of next generation sequencing were evaluated in searching for the remaining unknown causative genes ofthis inherited disease. Methods: Patients with clinically diagnosis of DSD with additional dysmorphic features were recruited. We appliedtheï¬lter based hybridization method as the main strategy for whole exome sequence (WES) enrichment. The ampli ï¬ed exomes were hybridized against the DNA libraries and sequenced subsequently. We ï¬nally used the integrated computing programs to call the genetic variants for DSD. Results: We enrolled a total of 10 syndromic DSD patients. Targeted amplicons were smoothly generated with adequate capture ef ï¬ciency (coverage 98% of exons and 100% >30 read depths). Among them, we found 2 patientscompatible with CHARGE syndrome (one is c.1480C>T, p. Arg494X and the other is c.6571G>A, p.

Both genetic and epigenetic increase risk of ESRD. A three to nine fold greater risk of ESRD is observed in individuals with afamily history of ESRD, so role of genetic study is important nowadays. Material and Method: A 43 year old, Iranian man were detected ESRD with nephrocalcinosis (multiple stones). According to nephrologist decision, primary hyperoxaluria was considered so that was candidate for kidney and livertransplant. So, genetic analysis was requested to approve mentioned diagnosis. Whole exome sequencing (WES) test was performed to ï¬nd variants responsible for renal disorder. His parents had consanguineous marriage. His father and two sisters suffered from nephrocalcinosis. According toresults of WES test and analysis all genes responsible to renal disorder, one likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant (c.735 1G>A) in splice site region was found in GRHPR gene. This gene is responsible for primary hyperoxaluria type 2 with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Clinical manifestations in patients were same as Men tioned disease, after examining of clinical data. Familial segregation was done and his father and two sisters are carrier of this variant.

Itusually occurs in adolescence or young adulthood and accounts for at least 1 3% of all diabetes. GCK MODY is one of four most common type of MODY with estimatedprevalence of 1:1000. It is characterized by mild, stablefasting hyperglycemia which is often discovered inciden tally during routine medical screening. Materials and Methods: After clinical examination, 56 patients with stable hyperglycemia, small 2 hour increment in OGTT, positive family history of type 2 or gestational diabetes and negative pancreatic antibodies were tested forGCK MODY. The promoter, whole coding region and ï¬anking intronic regions of the GCK gene were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Pathogenicity of identi ï¬ed mutations was veri ï¬ed in reference databases for mutations related with GCK MODY. Results: 17 different mutations in GCK gene were found in 32 patients. Most of the mutations were in exon 7 (six mutations in 16 patients) and in exon 9 ( ï¬ve mutations in 5 patients). The most common mutation was p. Thr228Met inexon 7 found in 8 patients from 4 different famillies. One patient was apparently homozygous for mutation p. Gly170Asp, but its true homozygosity is not yet con ï¬rmed, it can be a result of an allele dropout due to SNP in the primer region. In one patient we detected a novel variant c.806T>G, p.

To date, six homozygous mutations have been described in DHH in 46,XY patientsconferring phenotypes ranging from partial to complete gonadal dysgenesis, associated with of without polyneuropathy. Materials and Methods: We investigated three patients from two families with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, for pathogenic sequence alterations in 31 associated genes, within house designed next generation sequencing (NGS) tar geted gene panel, using an Ion Torrent platform. Ultrasound1250and histopathological examination of the gonads with electrophysiological examination of peripheral nerves were performed.

TIP60 is known to be destabilized by different onco viruses and this intrigued us to inspect its role in another onco viruspathogenesis, hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV, the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6 thmost common cancer in the world. Among the four overlappingopen reading frames of HBV, the HBV X gene (HBx) is considered the causative agent for malignant transformation associated with HBV infection. In this conference I amgoing to discuss data that show TIP60 being targeted by HBx, a proto oncogene of HBV proteasomally, by utilizingan E3 ubiquitin ligase, EDD1 in the cell. By utilizing various cell culture models, we demonstrate that HBx and TIP60 form a complex with EDD1. Interestingly, this hacking of TIP60 protein, enables increased proliferation of hepatocytes, as con ï¬rmed by various growth assays and mechanistically by increased expression of TERT and decreased levels of TIP60 protein. Additionally, tissue microarray analysis(TMA)of HBV positive malignant tumor samples demonstrate a strong correlation betweenTIP60 and EDD1 levels, further supporting our hypothesis. We therefore propose TIP60 as one of the cellular targets in HBx mediated viral infection and to utilize small moleculeinhibitors against the identi ï¬ed ubiquitin ligase in HBx mediated HBV carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our study has identi ï¬ed a relatively unknown role of HBx, its destabiliza tion of an epigenetic writer and the mechanism involved in this phenomenon.

The presence of blood inthe urine could be due to trauma, infections, systemic disease, disorders of the coagulation or genetic mutations affecting the development and function of particular celland tissue types. The presence of family history is indicative of a hereditary condition such as disorders of the basement membrane, complement or podocytes. Differential diag nosis of hematuria is crucial for successful treatment of the underlying condition. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1251Materials and Methods: Illumina TruSight One Sequencing Panel was used for mutation screening in 8 families with multiple members with hematuria. The index patients were referred with initial diagnoses of glomerulo pathy, thin basement membrane nephropathy, uric acid nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubu lointerstitial nephritis and/or chronic kidney disease. Results: Using next generation screening we determined the genetic cause of hematuria in Bulgarian families. Pathogenic variants were found in the type IV collagen (autosomal recessive and dominant variants in COL4A4, X linked in COL4A5) and complement genes. Both missenseand splice mutations, known pathogenic and novel variants were found. A potential role of heterozygous C1QC muta tions in the pathogenesis of G3 glomerulopathy wasobserved. Conclusion: Clinical diagnosis of hereditary hematuria is often hindered by phenotype variability, lack of informationfor disease progression in older family members, dif ï¬culties in obtaining biopsy samples, etc. Addition of massive par allel sequencing of large gene to the diagnostic procedurewould allow timely and precise determination of the molecular cause of the disease.

Materials and Methods: A 57 year old patient with congenital oculocutaneous albinism, thrombocytopathy and late onset accelerated pulmonary ï¬brosis was referred to our clinic. Negative family history of these symptoms suggested autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. We performed NGS analysis of proband parents trio. Whole exomelibraries were prepared according to the Nimblegen Seq Cap EZ Exome v3 protocol and sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 for all of them. Furthermore, we performedin silico analysis of a virtual gene panel, including HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, DTNBP1, BLOC1S3 , andPLDN . Results: Whole exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a com pound heterozygous genotype in HPS1 gene in the proband. We identi ï¬ed a pathogenic frameshift variant c.1189delC (p. Gln397Serfs*2), resulting in a premature stop codon, associated with HPS. Furthermore, we identi ï¬ed a rare, previously undescribed nonsense variant, c.1507C>T (p. Gln503*), resulting in a premature stop and mRNA degradation. Presence of both variants was veri ï¬ed by Sanger sequencing. The following molecular genetic ana lysis of parents con ï¬rmed their heterozygous carrier status. Conclusions: Compound heterozygous mutations in HPS1 in the proband lead to disruption of HPS1 gene and clinical manifestation of Hermansky Pudlak syndrome with severe pulmonary ï¬brosis leading to respiratory failure and death.

HHT type 1 is caused byENG gene mutations and it is characterized by a high incidence of pulmonary and cerebral AVMs. Type 2 is caused by ACVRL1 gene mutations and it is associatedwith hepatic AVMs. Mutations in SMAD4 gene cause Juvenile Polyposis/HHT syndrome. Here we report two1252cases with suspected HHT 1 and HHT 2 in which new ENG and ACVRL1 mutations where found. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from blood samples of patients with suspected HHT. ENG, ACVRL1 and SMAD4 genes were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing and results were con ï¬rmed by Sanger Sequencing. Results: Case 1: mutation c.780_781insCCTACG (p. Ser260_Trp261insProTh) on ENG gene was identi ï¬ed in a 16 year old boy with epistaxis, PAVM and HHT 1 family history. This mutation hasn ât been reported yet. Genetic testing was also performed in patient âs three brothers and two cousins. The mutation was identi ï¬ed in one brother (4 years old, experiencing bleeding episodes) and both cousins (9 and 7 years old). Two brothers (15 and 9 years old,without any HHT symptoms) resulted negative. Case 2: mutation c.1327T>G (p. Cys443Gly) on ACVRL1 gene was identi ï¬ed in a 45 years old woman with severe liver AVMs and enlisted for transplantation, rare epistaxis and no HHT family history. The mutation, consistent with clinical sus pect of HHT 2, hasn ât been described yet. Conclusions: Here we report new ENG and ACVRL1 mutations thought to be causative of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Further clinical evaluation on carrier and not carrier relatives will be performed. F. Cro â:A. Employment (full or part time); Signi ï¬cant; Synlab Italia. C. Lapucci: A.

Approxi mately 18% of patients have additional anatomical malformations or associated neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and intellectual disability. A subset of these patients have a known genetic syndrome in whichHSCR has a variable expression or penetrance. In others, the genetic etiology is unknown and we hypothesize that rare Copy Number Variation (CNV) impacts their diseasedevelopment. Indeed, rare Copy Number (CN) losses were signiï¬cantly enriched in patients with HSCR and additional anomalies without a known causal variant (n ,23, p,3.64E 7), and not in isolated HSCR (n ,20, p,0.700) or in HSCR patients with a known RET or other causal variant (n ,15, p,0.705). Of the HSCR patients with additional anomalies tested, at least ï¬ve (three males and two females) had a large de novo CNV and one male inherited an X linked CN loss. Patients with a known causal variant had a signi ï¬cant lower burden of the known HSCR predisposing risk haplotypes (P ,0.0232), and isolated HSCR patients a higher burden (P ,0.0277) compared to patients with HSCR and additional anomalies without a known causal variant. The rare CN losses identi ï¬ed are enriched for dosage sensitive genes, expressed in the developing mouse entericnervous system (ENS; p ,1.760E 10): SLC8A1 ,DDR1 , GNL1 ,GABBR1 ,MAPK8 ,UFD1L ,FHIT ,AKT3 ,TUBB , TBX2 ,BCAS3 andUSP32 . Additionally, the latter four, had rare putative deleterious variants in HSCR patients without a deleterious CNV, con ï¬rming our hypothesis that rare CNV contributes to syndromic HSCR with unknowngenetic etiology.

Our previous study revealed thatNRG1 rare variant frequency in Indonesian HSCR patients is <1%. Therefore, we wished to investigate NRG1 expression and methylation effect on HSCR pathogenesisin Indonesia. Methods: NRG1 type I ( HRG Î±, HRG Î²1, HRG Î²2, HRG Î²3, HRG Î³andNDF43 isoforms), type II and type III expressions in both ganglionic and aganglionic colon of HSCR patients and control colons were analysed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Next, we treatedthe extracted gDNA from HSCR patients âand control colons with sodium bisulfate and analyzed the methylation pattern of NRG1 exon 1 with methylation speci ï¬c PCR. Results: NRG1 expressions were up regulated in HSCR patients colon compared with control (type I: 13.81Â±1.79 vs.15.22Â±1.22 vs. 17.78Â±1.27; type II: 13.93Â±1.52 vs.15.67Â±1.52 vs. 16.57Â±1.02; type III: 11.98Â±2.86 vs.16.24 Â±2.28 vs. 17.51Â±1.48, respectively), with p value of 0.02, 0.03 and 0.01, respectively. Furthermore, HRG Î²1/HRG Î²2 expressions almost reached a signi ï¬cant difference between ganglionic and control colons (13.07Â±1.32 vs. 14.75Â±1.26, p,0.09). Most HSCR patients (80%) and controls (75%) revealed partially methylated NRG1 .NRG1 methylation levels were lower in the ganglionic and aganglionic than control colons, however did not reach a signi ï¬cant level (p,0.31 and 0.13, respectively). Conclusions: We shows the aberrant NRG1 expression in Indonesian HSCR patients and might not be due to DNAmethylation. Moreover, our study provides further insights into the contribution of aberrant NRG1 expression in the HSCR pathogenesis. Gunadi: None. A. Kalim: None. N. Budi: None. N. Arï¬an:None. E.

Herein we test the hypothesis that variants rs738409 (p. I148M) in PNPLA3 and rs58542926 (p. E167K) in TM6SF2 associated with pathogenesis of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease also represent novel hypercholesterolemia associated variants. We propose that both non synonymous variants associate with the change ofcircadian behavior in hepatic cells and contribute to the development of the hypercholesterolemia. Materials and Methods: DNA samples from a Slovenian general screening programme of preschool children, age of 5, with known total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol diag nosed with FH were obtained (N ,121). The frequency of variants rs738409 and rs58542926 were compared to Eur opean individuals from 1000 Genomes and Exome variant server databases. With CRISPR/Cas9 technology we gen erated HepG2 cells with different PNPLA3 and/or TM6SF2 genotypes and assessed the metabolic, expression and pro liferation aspects. Results: An association between the PNPLA3 rs738409 and TM6SF2 rs58542926 minor allele with hypercholes terolemia has been identi ï¬ed if compared to European males from 1000 Genomes (OR ,1.451, 95%CI ,1.093 1.926, p<0.01; OR ,0.3583, 95%CI ,0.1536 0.8358, p<0,05) and European Americans from EVS database(OR,1.491, 95%CI ,1.075 2.097, p<0.05; OR ,0.3621, 95%CI,0.1603 0.8181, p<0,01). HepG2 cells were found homozygous for rs738409 minor allele and rs58542926major allele. We currently evaluate the circadian expression of both genes and the effect of cholesterol on genotypes of genetically modi ï¬ed cell lines.

Large contiguous gene deletions have been reported as anextremely rare cause of hyperinsulinism but are not routinely screened thus these may be an underappreciated cause of the disorder. We aimed to assess the contribution of large deletions to the aetiology of hyperinsulinism. Materials and Methods: Using off target CNV (copy number variant) calling from targeted next generation sequencing data we screened 865 patients with hyper insulinism for large deletions (>1Mb). Results: We identi ï¬ed causative contiguous gene dele tions in 16/865 patients in our cohort. 13 were previously reported to cause hyperinsulinism: X chromosome deletions(Turner syndrome) (n ,3), 9p deletions (n ,9) and a 16p deletion (n ,1). We also identi ï¬ed 3 patients with over lapping de novo deletions on chromosome 20. These were the only novel large (>1Mb) de novo deletions within the cohort. They are a new cause of hyperinsulinism. Conclusions: 2% of patients in our cohort had causative large contiguous gene deletions. This is likely to be an underestimate of the prevalence of large deletions in hyperinsulinism as some patients will have had cytogenetictesting prior to referral for hyperinsulinism genetic testing. Large deletions are a rare but signi ï¬cant cause of hyper insulinism and should be screened for as part of geneticpanel tests for the disease. We also highlight a novel cause of hyperinsulinism: 20p11.2 deletions. Funding: Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society (105636/Z/14/Z and WT098395/Z/12/Z). T. W. Laver: None. M. N. Wakeling: None. R.

Trujillo Tiebas2 1Hospital Infantil Universitario NiÃ±o JesÃºs, Madrid, Spain, 2Health Research Institute JimÃ©nez DÃ­az FoundationUniversity Hospital, Madrid, Spain,3Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain In the last decade, the number of Idiopathic Central Precocious Puberty (ICPP) cases has decreased thanks to the discovery of mutations in different genes. Theidenti ï¬cation of loss of function of the maternal imprinted gene MKRN3 is the principal genetic cause of ICPP 1 12. More recently DLK1 has also been discovered as another imprinted gene implicated in the pathogenesis of ICPP13. Aims of the study: 1) To analyze the presence of pathogenic variants in 13 genes related to GnRH pathway;2) To evaluate the diagnostic yield of the coding region analysis of MKRN3; 3) To determine the presence of copy number variation (CNV) of DLK1 andMKRN3 genes; 4) To exclude uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome14. Patients and Methods: patients with ICPP were gathered from 2015 to 2018. In 20 patients we analyzed the clinicalexome ï¬ltered by 13 genes that included MKRN3 . Addi tionally, in another 11 patients we analyzed MKRN3 coding region by Sanger sequencing. In all patients we analyzed: a)DLK1 coding region by Sange sequencing; b) CNVs of MKRN3 andDLK1 by MLPA technique; c) UPD of chro mosome 14 using STRs markers. Results: from the 31 patients recruited we found two likely pathogenic variants in MKRN3 in one sporadic case and in one familial case. Conclusion: MKRN3 gene is the most frequent genetic cause both sporadic and familial ICPP so we propose it as theï¬rst one to be screened in the genetic approach of patients with ICPP. N. V.

We performed genetic testing on a patient diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary ï¬brosis who also had telomere lengths in the 1stcentile. Materials and Methods: Next Generation sequencing was performed on patient DNA using our in house Respi geneâ¢panel of 172 genes. An in house bioinformatics pipeline, con ï¬gured to interpret genes associated with rare respiratory conditions, was used to classify SNVs and CNVs. Results: Initial analysis did not detect any potentially pathogenic variants in genes associated with ILD in the patient. Another laboratory reported a RTEL1 splice variant: c.1266+3A>G. Further investigation using different variant callers detected a 78bp deletion at the RTEL1 exon 15/ intron 15 boundary. Sanger sequencing and Tapestationanalysis con ï¬rmed the patient to be heterozygous for the 78bp deletion. This deletion is classi ï¬ed as a VUS, but we consider it more likely pathogenic than benign. The c.1266+3A>G variant showed an allelic balance of less than 40%, and our results suggest it is an artefact caused by bioin formatic misalignment of the complex repeat region. Conclusion: Complex and repetitive genomic regions still prove challenging for routinely used variant calling software and Sanger sequencing. The error in variant callingmay have resulted in a missed genetic diagnosis in this patient. Increasing intronic ï¬anking regions for bioinfor matic analysis when performing targeted sequencing andâtraining âof bespoke bioinformatic pipelines will improve detection of complex variants in the exon/intron boundaries and beyond.

Materials and Methods: Incorporating system medicine approach, intestinal transit spanning constipation, eosinophil derived neurotoxin, bile acids, diet composition,intestinal electrical conductivity, indole etc., along with NMR metabolomics, were assessed. Furthermore, structure, diversity and function of intestinal microbiota using shot gun metagenomics were investigated. Finally, all observa tions were integrated and analyzed in correlation to negative physiological symptoms, related to obesity and metabolicsyndrome in same participants. Results: Inactivity negatively affected fecal consistency and in combination with hypoxia aggravated the state of gutinï¬ammation. On the other hand, many of the microbial parameters were shown to lag behind the changes in human physiology and intestinal environment, since signi ï¬cant changes in bacterial community were delayed until week four in HBR only, where members of the genus Bacteroides and proteins involved in iron acquisition and metabolism, cellwall, capsule, virulence and mucin degradation were enriched. Conclusions: Our multi omics approach suggest a time dependent and complex interplay between the host physiol ogy (including apparent constipation), immunity (in ï¬amma tion), controlled diet, intestinal environment variables and microbiome physiology during the acute cessation of exer cise.

Nearly 100 genes have been implicated insyndromes presenting with early onset colitis. We aimed to decipher the genetic basis of severe infantile colitis and eosinophilic GI disease without recurrent infections in a 10 years old boy, and subsequently characterize his GI and immunological phenotypes. Materials and Methods: We used trio whole exome sequencing (WES) for pathogenic variant discovery. Protein expression was studied using western blot (WB) analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Immunologicalworkup included in vitro T cell studies, ï¬ow cytometry and CyTOF analyses. Results: WES revealed a rare homozygous variant in CARMIL2: c.1590C>A; p. Asn530Lys. The variant was predicted pathogenic and co segregated with the disease inthe nuclear family. WB and IHC studies revealed markedly reduced CARMIL2 expression in patient cells compared to controls. Comprehensive in vitro immunological analyses demonstrated severely reduced regulatory T cells (T reg) with impaired CD4+T cell proliferation and T reggeneration. CyTOF analysis revealed signi ï¬cant shifts in the innate and adaptive immune cells of the patient compared to ulcerative colitis patients and healthy controls. Conclusions: Pathogenic bi allelic CARMIL2 variants cause an immunode ï¬ciency syndrome characterized by recurrent infections and skin lesions, occasionally with concurrent diarrhea. This study expands our knowledge onthe immune landscape alterations caused by CARMIL2 defects and underscores the role of CARMIL2 as a candidate gene for early onset in ï¬ammatory and eosinophilic GI disease. The predominant GI manifestations in the patient warrant further study of CARMIL2 function in the gut. A. Kurolap: None. O. Eshach Adiv: None. L. Konni kova: None. L. Werner: None. C.

Methods: Targeted next generation sequencing with high sequencing depth of a large IKD gene panel was performedin 426 patients with early onset CKD (<30 years), including patients with: 1) congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (n ,89) (with bilateral anomalies and/or extrarenal defects and/or familial CAKUT), 2) renal cystic ciliopathies (n ,180), 3) suspected inherited glo merular disease (n ,129) and 4) renal tubulopathies/ nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis (n ,28). Results: Causative mutations were found in 64% (271/ 426) of patients: 42% (37/89) with CAKUT, 76% (137/180)with renal cystic ciliopathies, 60% (77/129) with suspected inherited glomerular disease and 71% (20/28) with renal tubulopathy/nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis. Copy numbervariants were detected in 11% of all genetically diagnosed patients (29/271). Pathogenic variants were identi ï¬ed in 57 different genes, 10 of which ( COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, HNF1B, NPHP3, PAX2, PKD1, PKD2, PKHD1 andTSC2 ) explained 75% (203/271) of patients. Conclusion: Our IKD gene panel allowed a precise molecular diagnosis in nearly two thirds of patients with early onset CKD. The high diagnosis yield of our approach can be explained by 1) the ef ï¬cient detection of copy number variants and variants in complex genomic regions, such as PKD1 gene, due to the high sequencing depth and 2) the strict clinical inclusion criteria to favor genetic testingin patients with likely monogenic cause of nephropathy.

30212,"Golnik, Golnik, SloveniaIntroduction: Rare variants in telomere metabolism associated genes have recently been shown to be important contributors to idiopathic pulmonary ï¬brosis (IPF), regard less of the family history. We aimed to validate the result in an independent cohort of IPF patients. Methods: We calculated that in order to have 80% power to detect at least one IPF patient with a causative mutation in a telomere metabolism associated gene, if the prevalence of mutations is the same as in the above referenced study(13.2%), we had to sequence 11 patients for the presence of mutations in those genes. To get a random sample we included 11 consecutive IPF patients, regardless of theirfamily history of IPF, at their control visit at our University Clinic. All patients had IPF diagnosis according to ATS/ ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines. Sequencing of telomere meta bolism associated genes was performed on the Illumina platform. Results: Demographic statistics of our sample were comparable to other IPF demographics with regard to age (mean age ,71.2 years), IPF family history (1/11 (9.1%)) and sample male predominance (8/11 (72.7%)). In 2 out of11 (18.2%) patients, none of which had a family history of IPF and were therefore classi ï¬ed as sporadic IPF cases, the causative variant was found (NM_001283009(RTEL1):c.326_329del (p. I109fs); NM_001193376(TERT): c.1374delC (p. W459fs)). Despite suf ï¬cient coverage (mean coverage ,121X) we didn ât conï¬rm the causative variant in the only patient with a family history of IPF in our cohort. Conclusions: Causative variants in telomere metabolism associated genes play a signi ï¬cant role also in sporadic IPF. J.Å elb:None. M. Rijavec: None. K. Osolnik: None. P. Koro Å¡ec:None.",2019
30213,"Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is normally caused by homozygosity for pathogenic mutations in the HFE (homeostatic iron regulator) gene. Other autosomal reces sive forms of HH are associated with mutations in genes involved in iron homeostasis including hemojuvelin ( HJV), hepcidin ( HAMP ) and transferrin receptor 2 ( TFR2 ). Autosomal dominant forms of iron overload are associated with mutations in the cellular iron exporter ferroportin(SLC40A1 ), with a single case linked to a mutation in the 5âUTR of the H ferritin gene ( FTH1 ). We describe a family1258with apparent autosomal dominant iron overload with characteristics similar to the classical form of ferroportin disease. The condition is characterised by elevated serum ferritin levels with normal or mildly elevated transferrin saturation. Perls âPrussian blue staining of liver biopsy sections in two affected individuals show prominent irondeposition in both Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Sequen cing of the coding sequences and splice sites of genes known to cause HH revealed no mutations in the proband. Whole genome SNP genotyping was performed on 15 members of the pedigree. Linkage analysis showed haplotypes on regions of chromosomes 1, 3, 12, 18 and19 that were shared among the four most clearly affected members of the pedigree but not present in the three most clearly unaffected members. These regions encompass atotal of 93 megabases, approximately 3% of the human genome and contain over 1500 canonical genes. Impor tantly, these genomic intervals do not contain the SLC40A1 gene indicating that affected members of this family do not have a variant form of ferroportin disease. D. Wallace: None. N.

Several surgical techniques have been developed for such purpose, including partial hepatectomy (PH), intraoperative portal vein ligation (PVL), and associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS). Indeed, while clinical outcomes are somewhat comparable, different proceduresshow clinically distinct recovery patterns. The observable clinical differences likely mirror some underlying variations in the patterns of gene activation and regenerationpathways. Materials and Methods: We provided a comprehensive comparative analysis of the gene regulation in regeneratingrat livers temporally spaced at 24h and 96h after PH, PVL, and ALPPS using the next generation RNA sequencing transcriptomics analysis. Results: The time dependent factors appear to be the most important determinant of post injury alterations of gene expression in liver regeneration. Early transcriptomicchanges that were found in all three procedures included cell cycle associated genes and immune response activation genes as well as transcription factors, DNA replicationregulators, G1/S transition regulators, and cytokinesis. Conclusions: The functional pathway and gene network analyses revealed both unique and overlapping molecularmechanisms and pathways for each surgical procedure. Identi ï¬cation of molecular signatures, such as gene to gene interactions, regenerative signaling pathways, speci ï¬ct o each surgical procedures further our understanding of key regulators of liver regeneration as well as patient popula tions that are likely to bene ï¬t from each procedure.

30216,"JUMC, Krakow, PolandIntroduction: The most common form of monogenic diabetes is MODY. An easy to use MODY predictionmodel for identifying genetic test indicated patient cases was developed in 2012: www.diabetesgenes.org/content/ mody probability calculator . The aim of this study was to validate the utility of this tool with MODY patients in the Polish population. Materials and Methods: Our MODY patient database was established 18 years ago at the Department of Meta bolic Diseases, JUMC, Krakow, Poland and was based ontypical clinical inclusion criteria. Patients in the database who provided all answers to the MODY calculator ques tionnaire 106 GCK MODY and 92 HNF1A MODY were included. The control group was established with 85 T1DM individuals and it does not include any T2DM patients due to insuf ï¬cient number of sub 35 year old T2DM cases in our outpatient clinic as required in the calculator model. Results: The mean predictive value using the calculator was 63.1% for GCK MODY and 44.92% for HNF1A MODY patients. This is in contrast with the mean calculator predictive value of 4.82% for T1DM patients. Only twoT1DM patients out of 85 obtained a calculator predictive value higher than 25% the minimum suggested criteria for genetic testing referral. Only 11 GCK MODY patients and33 HNF1A MODY patients received a sub 25% score. Sensitivity and speci ï¬city for both types of MODY were 77.78% and 97.65% respectively. GCK MODY whencompared to HNF1A MODY obtained better sensitivity. Conclusion: The model based on the Hattersley's group calculator reliably indicated genetic testing for GCK MODY patients among our sub population of Polish patients.

The defect in beta cell function is the cause of MODY. There are several known subtypes of MODY and each subtype occurs by pathogenic variants of different genes. Approximately 80% of MODY occurs by GCK andHNF1A pathogenic variants in European population, but different ethnics may have different rates of subtypes. This study aimed to explain the genetic architecture of MODY suspected 132 Turkish patients. In this study, genes known to be associated with MODY ( SLC161,KLF11,G6PC2,1260HADH,MOG,ZFP57,RFX6,GCK,PAX4,BLK,GLIS3,NEUR OG3,GLUD1,INS,KCNJ11,ABCC8, HNF1A,PDX1,HNF1B, INSR,NKX2 2,HNF4A,FOXP3 ) were sequenced by using IonTorrent S5 and runs were then analyzed with bioinfor matics pipeline. Of 132 patients, pathogencic, VUS(variant unknown signi ï¬cance), and DAP(disease associated poly morphism) were detected in 39 patients. Additionally, anew variant identi ï¬ed in GCK is classi ï¬ed as pathogenic according to ACGM criteria and this variant was deter mined as de novo with the segragation analysis. The mostcommon pathogenic variants were seen in GCK and the results are shown on the table. The novel variant detected in GCK results in premature stop codon because of frame shiftmutation. The pathogenic variants detected in different genes revealed that NGS method is suitable to test genetic ethiology of multigenic diseases like MODY.

It is the cause in approximately 2% of diabetic patients, but it is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Although fourteen different genes have beenimplicated, mutations in the glucokinase gene, GCK , and genes coding for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 Î±,1Î²and 4 Î± (HNF1A ,HNF1B andHNF4A , respectively), are the most common causes of MODY, accounting for up to 70% of mutated alleles. Methodology: 112 patients with criteria for MODY type diabetes, from adults Endocrinology or Genetics consulta tion, underwent molecular genetics testing at UBG. Mole cular genetics studies were performed by Sanger sequencingof one or more of the following genes, according to clinical suspicion: HNF1A ,GCK ,HNF4A andHNF1B . Results: We present the molecular characterization of 24 patients where a de ï¬nite or probable causing mutation was identi ï¬ed, thus 21%. Fourteen (58%) are HNF1A MODY, eight (33%) are GCK MODY and two (8%) are HNF1B MODY. Eighteen different mutations were identi ï¬ed 10 in HNF1A ,6o n GCK and 2 on HNF1B including 3 novel mutations: c.1146_1156del and c.1422_1424delGCCin sCAG in HNF1A and c.863T>C on GCK . Conclusions: The prevalence of HNF1A MODY and GCK MODY in our cohort is much lower than the valuesdescribed. The MODY spectrum in Portugal is expected to be different from the one reported in other populations and will be revealed after the study of remainder MODY genes. F. E.D. R. Laranjeira: None. I.

MODY is a common form of monogenic diabetes and it may account for 1% to2% of all diabetes cases in Europe. Many people with MODY are misdiagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods: All adult subjects with diabetes onset under age of 45 years and currently older than 18 years. Other inclusion criteria are: evidence of endogenous insulin secretion (fasting or random C peptide â¥0.2 nmol/ L) and negative glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA), islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) and islet tyrosine phosphatase 2 (IA2). We analysed 44 patients for HNF1A MODY, 14 patients for HNF4A MODY and 8 patients for HNF1B MODY. For identi ï¬cation of mutations in the coding and promoter region of analyzed genes, we used theSanger sequencing method. Results: We identi ï¬ed six different mutations in nine patients for subtype HNF1A MODY. These mutations arelocated in exons 2, 3, 4 and 6, but the greatest number are found in exon 4, p.

Correct diagnosis might allow change treatment, especially when it is mistaken for type 1 diabetes. Here we analyzedgenetic variants in Lithuanian pediatric patients with suspected monogenic diabetes. Materials and Methods: We performed GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A genes Sanger sequencing for pediatric patients (0 18 years old) for whom there was mild hyperglycemia or were diagnosed type 1 diabetes with negative antibodymarkers (glutamic acid decarboxylase, insulin and insulinoma associated 2 antibodies) in the year 2017 2018. Results: 32 patients were analyzed for all 3 genes, or one of them depending on clinical situation. 50% of them had at least second degree relative with anamnesis of diabetes or hyperglycemia. For 8 of the patients we found GCK non synonymous heterozygous variants which were previously reported as pathogenic. 2 patients had heterozygous variants inHNF1A: one with frameshift variant c.872dupC and another nonsynonymous variant c.809A>C which was not reported earlier. This variant changes amino acid in DNA binding region (p. Asn270Thr), cosegregates in patientsfamily as patients father and grandmother (father âs line) were diagnosed with diabetes.

MODY3 patients, who are oftenmisdiagnosed as type1/type2 diabetes, are important to identify, since they can bene ï¬t from sulfonylurea treatment rather than insulin. The aim of this study was to functionallyinvestigate possible pathogenic effects of 11 HNF1A variants from the Norwegian MODY registry, in order to provide a precise diagnosis and treatment. Materials and Methods: The Norwegian MODY reg istry includes 2125 individuals with suspected MODY. HNF1A variants (Sanger identi ï¬ed) were investigated by transactivation (luciferase assay), protein expression (immunoblotting), DNA binding (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and nuclear localization assays. Results: AllHNF1A variants investigated were classi ï¬ed as variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance. Variants p. (Ala116Thr), p.(Lys222del) and p.(Asn266Ser) showed lowtranscriptional activity (15 36%). p.(Ala116Thr) and p. (Lys222del) demonstrated low DNA binding (23% and 17%), and impaired nuclear localization. Moreover, p.(Lys222del) exhibited low protein expression (26%). Car riers of functionally impaired variants manifested with early diabetes onset (<25 years). The autoantibody status wasnegative or not tested. Carriers of p.(Ala116Thr) and p. (Lys222del) had a family history of diabetes. The p. (Ala116Thr) carrier had earlier been treated with sulfony lurea with no optimal effect. Her sister (also carrier), is treated successfully with sulfonylurea. The p.(Lys222del) and p.(Asn266Ser) patients are currently treated with insu lin/metformin, and should be considered shifted to sulfo nylurea. The remaining variants were either functionally normal or moderately impaired. Conclusions: Functional investigation of HNF1A var iants should support precision medicine in MODY3 patients.

30222,"Lodz, Lodz, Poland,2Department of Pediatrics, Diabetology, Endocrinology and Nephrology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland Introduction: Monogenic forms of diabetes represent 5 7% of all diabetes types. They are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations in single genes, most of which regulate the pancreatic Î²cells function. The aim of the study was to determine the genetic background in patients referred to the Outpatient Genetics Clinic of the Centre for Monogenic Diabetes in Lodz, Poland. Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of 379 patients with suspected monogenic diabetes aged from 3 months to 38 years diagnosed from February 2017 toJanuary 2019. They were referred based on the age of diagnosis, family history, autoantibodies status, preserved insulin secretion, different clinical course of diabetes orcoexistence of other symptoms. The next generation sequencing (NGS) method was performed using a designed panel of 35 genes (SureSelect, Agilent) and the followingplatforms and programs: Variant Studio (Illumina Â®), Phe nIX (CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin) and IGV (Broad Institute).

Currently is described 25 genes responsible for up to 70% of the disease from which 30 40% is caused by NPHP1 gene deletion. The main symptoms are kidney degeneration and ï¬brotic tissue formation, leading in renal failure often in childhood. Other less common symptoms include growth retardation, anemia and metabolic changes. The disease is caused by the presence of two causal mutations from parents, formation of disease de novo is rare. We describe three families their children have a de ï¬ned clinical diagnosis of nephronophtisis. Methods: We tested DNA isolated from peripheral blood and the molecular analysis of genes associated with nephronophthisis was performed by MLPA and customdesigned NGS. Found causal mutations were veri ï¬ed by Sanger sequencing. Results: By the analysis of 3 patients with clinical diagnosis of nephronophtisis we found homozygous causal mutations in two of them and two different heterozygous causal mutations (compound heterozygote) in one of them. Conclusion: Molecular genetic testing con ï¬rmed a clin ical diagnosis of nephronophtisis in all three patients. Follow up segregation of causal variants in the patients â families identi ï¬ed healthy carriers of these variants and in one family we con ï¬rmed the diagnosis in affected siblings. The knowledge of causal mutations is important not onlyfor con ï¬rmation of the diagnosis, but also for healthy car riers in case of pregnancy planning and possible prenatal testing. J.

PC, the major glyceropho spholipid in eukaryotic cells, can be synthesized by three pathways: the de novo pathway, also known as Kennedy1264pathway, the Lands cycle and the phosphatidylethanolamine methyl transferase (PEMT) pathway. PC biosynthesis is required for normal very low density lipoprotein secretion from hepatocytes and generation of arachidonic acid (ARA); its inhibition may lead to excess storage of lipids within liver, contributing to the development of obesity associated hepatosteatosis. Aim: Whether PCTY1A, PCTY1A B and PEMT gene polymorphisms in obese children associate with obesity related somatometric and biochemical parameters. Material and Method: 200 obese children, aged 7 to 18 years old; BMI> +2SD; abdominal circumference above the 90th percentile; +/ HTA and dyslipidemia or insulin resistance. PCTY1A (rs 1580820) and PCTY1B (rs 4898190), PEMT(rs1109859, rs12103822, rs16961845,rs4244593, rs4479310, rs7214988, rs7946, rs8068641, rs936108, rs13342397, rs6502603) were analysed using next generation sequencing. Results: PCTY1A, PCTY1B and PEMT rs1109859 var iations were positively correlated with glycemia, choles terol, HDLc, total LA, ARA, BMI, cardiac frequency, andarterial and systolic blood pressure. PCTY1A and PCTY1B polymorphisms were correlated with plasma choline, and possibly with plasma betaine and 5 methyl tetrahydrofolate. Conclusion: Genetic variations involved in choline metabolism were associated with alterations in choline, folate, and cholesterol metabolism in obese children, andcould play important roles in the severity of associated metabolic alterations.

Currently, there is a scarce amount of information on adenoma derived ccfDNA. We examined the possibility to detect pituitary adenoma (PA) derived ccfDNA, by performing targeted NGS on ccfDNA usingsemiconductor sequencing. Materials and Methods: Blood samples used were obtained from ï¬ve NFPA patients before PA surgery. Six teen tumor speci ï¬c mutations each in unique gene (dis covered in exome sequencing) were targeted in ccfDNA. Results: Sequencing coverage was 6191X on average (range 444 13026). In two mutation sites (two patients) the alternate allele was in less than in 10% of reads: RYR1 (G/ A, 2.27%) , MPRIP (C/T, 3.65%). Five mutations (from two patients) had the alternate allele close to 50% of reads: VPS13D (C/T, 48%) , LDLRAD2 (C/T, 47%) , SPEN (A/G, 49%), GPATCH4 (C/T, 58%), G6PC2 (C/G, 46%). The alternate allele was in less than in 0.1% of reads in nine mutations, however, the estimated background alternate allele rate in non mutation sites also was below 0.1%. Conclusions: Results indicate that while it is possible to detect somatic mutations found in adenoma in ccfDNA using semiconductor sequencing the source of mutatedccfDNA molecules should be further researched. Mutation rate in 50% of reads could be due to somatic mosaicism or due to increased tumor cell apoptosis/necrosis in thesepatients.

Cell cultures derived from PA tissue can form freeï¬oating aggregates called pituispheres (PS) or adherentmesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). We studied genetic relationship between patients âgermline DNA, tumour tissue somatic DNA, DNA of PS and MSC obtained from culture to trace origin of each type of cultured cells. Materials and Methods: PA patients were enrolled to national biobank Genome Database of Latvian Populationfrom Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital where transsphenoidal surgery of PA was performed for all patients. Exomes (Illumina TruSeq_Rapid_Ex ome_TargetedRegions_v1.2) of germline, tumour somatic, PS and MSC were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq with 75bp paired end reads. Sequencing data were analyzed withIllumina Basespace Enrichment App (v3.0.0) aligning to human HG19 reference genome using Isaac Genome Alignment Software, variants called with Starling algorithmand variants annotated with Illumina Annotation Engine. Filtered variants were reviewed using IGV 2.3.14. Results: PAs contain low amount of tissue speci ï¬c mutations (median 4, range 2 6). Somatic mutations of the primary tumour can be detected in the respective PS, but not in the respective MSC. Genetic alterations of MSCs corre sponded to mutations in PA patients âgermline DNA. Conclusions: Using exome comparison we were able to trace origin of PS and MSC cell cultures, showing thatgenome of PS represents genome of PA while MSC most likely represent normal cells of pituitary or surrounding tissues.

It isestimated that PKD1 explains 85% and PKD2 15% of ADPKD cases. Genetic testing has become an important factor in the management of ADPKD. However, analysis ofPKD1 is technically challenging due to its large size, high GC content and duplication of the ï¬rst 33 exons with a high1266degree of homology to pseudogenes ( PKD1P1 P6 ). We evaluated the diagnostic yield and performance of our In house panels for cystic kidney disease. Materials and Methods: Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using the IDT xGEN Exome Research Panel with added custom probes and the IlluminaNovaSeq 6000 platform. This assay provides improved mapping quality and coverage of PKD1 compared to other NGS methods assessed in our laboratory. Results: PKD1 provided both high mean coverage (199x) and excellent mapping quality with 99.5% of the target nucleotides covered at least 20x. In the study cohort of 131index patients, a genetic diagnosis was established in 52% of cases with disease causing variants detected in 7 different genes. In 63% of the diagnostic cases the disease causingvariant was identi ï¬ed in PKD1 . Interestingly, 84% (n ,36) of the variants were located in the duplicated region of PKD1 . Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that our in house NGS platform is well suited for clinical diagnostics with comprehensive coverage in dif ï¬cult to sequence regions of PKD1 .

It is most frequently caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene, encoding ï¬brocystin, but mutations in other cilia related disease genes may mimic the phenotype. In 2017, Lu et al. reported homozygous mutations in DZIP1L located at 3q22.1, encoding the basal body protein DAZ interacting protein 1 like protein (DZIP1L) in seven children with ARPKD from four unrelated and consanguineous families. DZIP1L is locatedat the basal body of the primary cilium, and impaired function of DZIP1L is associated with a defect in the ciliary trafï¬cking of polycystin 1 and polycystin 2. So far, no other DZIP1L mutations have been reported, and ARPKD caused byDZIP1L mutations is a rare form of polycystic kidney disease. We performed whole exome sequencing in twoconsanguineous families with three children with polycystic kidney disease, and identi ï¬ed two different and not previously reported DZIP1L mutations in homozygous form: c.193T>C; p.(Cys65Arg), and c.216C>G; p. (Cys72Trp). All three children are phenotypically charac terized by enlarged echogenic kidneys with poor cortico medullary differentiation. No liver cysts were detected. Liver stiffness were evaluated in two of the children by transient elastography, and with normal result. Functionalanalyses of the p.

Most heritable PAH (75%) is caused by a pathogenic variant in BMPR2 , pathogenic variants in other genes are considerably less common (1 3%). Genetic testing enables early diagnosis and offers an opportunity for family screening. Materials and Methods: We designed a target sequen cing custom panel that includes 15 genes of interest. Genetic counselling was offered to every patients. To identify genetic mutations and help make a precise diagnosis and family screening, we performed genetic testing by NGS in six patients with PAH. Results: In three patients we identi ï¬ed variants classi ï¬ed according to ACMG Guidelines. In a 47 years old female affected by familial PAH, we identi ï¬ed a heterozygous nonsense variant (c.2617C>T) p. Arg873* in BMPR2 gene, classi ï¬ed as pathogenic.

Monash Health is a KidGen/ AustralianGenomics Health Alliance/Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance ï¬agship recruitment site, aiming to assess the impact of multidisciplinary renal genetic clinics on patientcare while providing access to whole exome sequencing (WES). Materials and Method: This three year audit (2015 2017) of renal patients referred to the Monash Health genetics service provides a picture of the renal genetics landscape at the outset of renal ï¬agship WES testing. The electronic medical record was searched using renal key words; each ï¬le was manually assessed for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collection included referrer speci alty, condition, family history, inheritance pattern, type and cost of genetic testing and impact of genetic testing on management and reproductive options. Results: Through keyword matching 676 patients were identi ï¬ed, 86 met inclusion criteria; 59 (69%) were pro bands with a primary renal condition and 35 (40.1%) werereferred by a nephrologist. Cystic renal disease was the commonest reason for referral. Genetic testing was arranged for 50 patients of whom 21 (42%) had informative results. Diagnosis rate improved from 2015 to 2017; cost per informative patient diagnosis was $2499. Conclusion: Audit provides a snapshot of the utility of clinical genetics input in a renal genetics context at the outset of improved WES access. Fourteen referred patients were unaffected providing them with reproductive reassur ance. Diagnosis rate improved from 2015 to 2017 as more molecular diagnoses were obtained, thus improving patient management. E. I. Krzesinski: None. Y. B. Prawer: None. M. J.P. Regan: None. A.

About 20% of children are steroid resistant NS (SRNS) which progress toend stage renal disease (ESRD). More than 53 genes are associated with SRNS which represent the genetic hetero geneity of SRNS. This study was aimed to screen diseasecausing mutations within NPHS1 and NPHS2 and evaluate new potential variants in other genes. Method: Inï¬rst phase of study, 25 patients with SRNS were analyzed for NPHS1 (exon 2, 26) and all exons of NPHS2 genes by Sanger sequencing. In the second phase, whole exome sequencing was performed on 10 patientswith no mutations in NPHS1 and NPHS2. Result: WES analysis revealed a novel mutation in FAT1 (c.10570C>A; Q3524K). We identi ï¬ed 4 pathogenic mutations, located in exon 4 and 5 of NPHS2 gene in 20% of patients (V180M, P118L, R168C and Leu156Phe).

IBD is composed of two main subtypes, namely Crohn âs disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). There are multiplephenotypes of IBD in terms of disease extension, disease severity and extraintestinal manifestations (EIM). EIM in IBD are frequent and may signi ï¬cantly impact the quality of patients life. Our aim was to investigate two TNF alpha gene SNPs for association with clinical manifestations in IBD patients. Materials and Methods: The study included 142 IBD patients (78 CD, 43M/35F and 64 UC, 40M/24F), all of Romanian origin. EIM were documented in 34 patients (20CD, 14 UC). The two SNPs of TNF alpha gene rs361525 ( 238G/A) and rs1800629 ( 308G/A) were genotyped by TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay (7300 Real TimePCR System, Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Sci entiï¬c, USA). Association tests for each polymorphism were performed with DeFinetti online software ( http://ihg2. helmholtzmuenchen.de/cgi bin/hw/hwa1.pl ) and p values â¤0.05 were considered signi ï¬cant.

Especially for missense substitutions it is challenging toAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1269predict the impact on protein function. We therefore re evaluated pathogenicity of all ABCC6 missense variants. Materials and Methods: The score based variant clas siï¬cation system Sherloc was used to analyze 234 variants from literature, ClinVar and in house patient screenings. Clinical and functional evidence were scored according tothe rules and guidelines of Nykamp et al. (2017). Results: Comprehensive classi ï¬cation revealed 74% variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS), 12% likely pathogenic, 10% pathogenic, 3% benign and 1% likely benign variants. VUS classi ï¬cation was further re ï¬ned into truly uncertain variants (69% of VUS) and those leaningtowards likely benign (1% of VUS) or likely pathogenic (30% of VUS). Taking the latter into account, 44% of ABCC6 variants is (likely) pathogenic when considering all available population, clinical, experimental and in silico data. This is signi ï¬cantly different from ClinVar, where 87% of ABCC6 missense variants are allegedly pathogenic and only 11% VUS. Conclusions: Our results underline that variant classi ï¬ cation should be done systematically and with caution, as ithas important consequences for patients and heterozygous carriers. The high number of VUS con ï¬rms the need for functional testing to prove or refute their causality beforereturning them to patients. S. Verschuere: None. P. Coucke: None. O. M.

It is best known in the somaticBCR ABL fusion gene associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Recently, Wang et al. described two germline missense variants in ABL1 causing an autosomal dominant developmental syndrome (OMIM 617602) with congenitalheart disease, skeletal malformations, and characteristic facies. Materials and Methods: Patients with de novo hetero zygous missense variants in ABL1 were identi ï¬ed via trio WES through the DDD Study with Sanger con ï¬rmation via UK regional genetics laboratories. Clinical assessments ofpatients were carried out via regional clinical genetics ser vices. To investigate ABL1 kinase activity in vitro, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid constructsencoding wild type or mutant ABL1 cDNA. Phosphoryla tion of ABL1 speci ï¬c substrates was measured by immu noblotting and potential for reversal investigated bytreatment with imatinib. Bio informatic analysis of gene wide conservation and germline/somatic variation was performed. Results: We identi ï¬ed three unrelated patients with de novo pathogenic missense variants in ABL1 , including two novel variants. All variants cluster in the myristoyl bindingpocket of ABL1 âa region critical for auto inhibitory reg ulation of the kinase domain, which is subject to high missense constraint and evolutionary conservation. Allpatients recapitulate the phenotype of the ABL1 develop mental syndrome. Functional studies of mutant ABL1 kinase activity are ongoing and will be presented. Conclusions: We describe three new cases with patho genic ABL1 missense variants causing skeletal malforma tions and congenital heart disease. Mutations cluster aroundthe myristoyl binding pocket of ABL1 , suggesting a gain of function mechanism due to loss of auto inhibition. A. J.M. Blakes: None. E. Gaul: None. W. Lam: None. N.

We have shown that 45/117 AD patients1270carry signi ï¬cantly more, rare loss of function (LOF) mutations in the SFTP family of genes as compared to 55/316 in a control population (p value ,0.000004). This group of EDC LOF (stopgain, frameshift) rare variants (EDC LR) consists of 20 variants observed in the 45 AD patients resulting in a calculated Odds Ratio of 2.96 and aRelative Risk of 2.38. Among the detected LOF variants, there are 25 cases of FLG LOF mutations as de ï¬ned by R501X (rs61816761), 2282del4 (rs558269137), other LOFsin FLG as well as LOFs in FLG2, HRNR, LCE4A, LCE5A, TCHH, TCHHL1 and other members of the EDC. We examine the regional accumulation of rare LOF variants inFLG region. For the entire EDC, we obtained a p value of 4.7e 20, much lower than for FLG alone p value of 4.5e 6, indicative of an even greater effect when analyzed jointly(entire family vs. FLG alone) in the AD context. The identi ï¬ed LOF variants within the region can serve as biomarkers as well as help delineate the genetic pro ï¬le in AD patients. S. P. Smieszek: A.

We evaluated the phenotypic consequences of an apparentlybalanced translocation in a family affected by craniosynos tosis and limb malformations presenting with a dominantinheritance pattern and variable expressivity. We applied large insert jumping libraries to localize the breakpoints and conï¬rmed these results with Sanger sequencing to char acterize breakpoints of a t(2;7)(p21;p15), followed by gene expression studies to explore the functional impact of the rearrangement. Sequencing revealed ï¬ve breakpoints, dis rupting two genes, HDAC9 and MACC1 . We discovered altered expression of TWIST1 located downstream of HDAC9 . Our results suggest that an inversion in the HDAC9 TWIST region in 7p21.1 affects regulation of TWIST , thereby producing a skeletal dysplasia with intrafamilial variable expressivity. These analyses suggestthat the mechanism of this rearrangement might involve alteration of regulatory sequences located at a distance in cis that dysregulate TWIST and insinuate HDAC9 as a new disease locus producing craniosynostosis.

Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain,7Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California at San Diego, SanDiego, CA, United States Introduction: Protein kinase A (PKA) is a tetramer containing a regulatory (R) subunit dimer locking 2 catalytic (C) subunits. The most abundantly expressed R subunit is PRKAR1A, composed of a dimerization domain,an inhibitory site, and 2 cAMP binding domains (CNB:A; CNB:B), each containing a phosphate binding cassette (PBC). Inactivating mutations in PRKAR1A cause acrody sostosis with hormonal resistance (ACRDYS1). Patients and Methods: We present a case of a 15 year old girl with clinical suspicion of pseudopseudohypopar athyroidism based on brachydactyly type E, severe sco liosis, and short stature without hormone resistance. HerAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1271mother presented a similar phenotype. After discarding alterations in GNAS, PTHLH ,IHH and GDF5 (Sanger sequencing, MS MLPA/MLPA), a skeletal dysplasia NGS panel was performed. Results: A heterozygous novel variant in PRKAR1A [NM_002734.4:c.592G>C; p.(Gly198Arg)], bioinformati cally predicted as likely pathogenic, was identi ï¬ed. Familial studies con ï¬rmed cosegregation (mother harbored; healthy grandparents did not harbor). Gly198 precedes the PBC ofCNB:A and its substitution to Arg is predicted to affect function because: (1) it might affect cAMP binding to CNB: A, as the long side chain of arginine will crash with itsneighboring residues (inactivating mutation); (2) the intro duction of the longer side chain into the tight PBC space could change its conformation leading to an altered bindingbetween the C and the R (activating/inactivating mutation). Conclusions: PRKAR1A variants can lead to phenotypes milder than ACRDYS1 depending on the affected proteindomain. Incomplete or partial PKA inactivation could lead to an isolated non severe brachydactyly without hormone resistance.

Mutations in KIAA0753 have been associated with Joubert syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, and moderate to fetal lethal skeletal dysplasia with narrowthorax and abnormal metaphyses. We have previously reported patients with biallelic fra meshift and nonsense mutations in this gene. We have alsoshown that KIAA0753 is expressed in normal fetal human growth plate and immunohistochemistry of the growth plateof an affected fetus revealed an abnormal proliferative zone and a broad hypertrophic zone. To con ï¬rm the role of Kiaa0753 in skeletal ciliopathies, we used the zebra ï¬sh model. Phenotyping of zebra ï¬sh larvae carrying a nonsense mutation in homozygosity showed that mutant larvae pre sented with curved body, a typical ciliopathy phenotype, aswell as abnormal cartilage patterning. kiaa0753 null zeb raï¬sh do not survive beyond the ï¬rst week of development, suggesting that loss of function (LoF) mutations inkiaa0753 are embryonic lethal. Interestingly, these kiaa0753 null larvae show loss of cilia and abnormal cell rearrangements, helping us understand how LoF mutationsinkiaa0753 affect cell organisation and embryonic devel opment. In aggregate, our results show that Kiaa0753 is important for the early embryo development in zebra ï¬sh, in accordance with the phenotypes seen in patients. Future plans involve using this disease model to develop treat ments for patients with KIAA0753 mutations. R. Vaz: None. A. HammarsjÃ¶: None. F. Taylan: None. D. Chitayat: None. G.

In humans, point mutations in the p63 coding region lead to develop mental defects, including syndromic orofacial clefting. Notably, common risk variants located intronically in p63 contribute also to the risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P), the most frequent isolated form of orofacial clefting. To date, our knowledge is limited about the role of p63 in human craniofacial development,due in part to a lack of tractable models. Here we investigated the role of p63 in human craniofacial development, and in the pathogenesis of nsCL/P. Usingan inducible trans differentiation model and systematic epigenomic sequencing (including ATAC seq together with1272ChIP seq of p63 and H3K27ac) we show that p63 establishes enhancers at craniofacial development genes to modulate their transcription. Speci ï¬c substitution mutations in the DNA binding or SAM protein interaction domain of p63 respectively eliminate or reduce establishment of these enhancers. Furthermore, using large scale GWAS data weshow that enhancers established by p63 are highly enriched for SNPs associated with nsCL/P. These orthogonal approaches indicate a strong molecular link between p63enhancer function and nsCL/P, illuminating molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental defect and revealing vital regulatory elements and new candidatecausative genes.

The natural history of CCD is poorly known. Isolated cases of patients with multiplefractures or osteoporosis have been described, without evaluating the other risk factors for bone fragility. The purpose of this study is to evaluate bone mineralization andthe occurrence of fractures inpatients with CCD, children and adults. In an observational study, we collected clinico radiological and genetics data, phosphocalcic balance, markers of bone remodeling and bone densitometry data of 45 CCD patients aged 9 months to 60.8 years (median , 15.4 years). 7% of patients evaluated had at least one fracture without trauma (3/45). 32% (13/41) patients have secondary hyperparathyroidism, a recognized risk factor forosteopenia due to increased bone resorption induced by parathyroid hormone and 20% (8/41) patients have vitamin Dd eï¬ciency (25 OH D <20ng / mL). The analysis of BMD shows that the Z score at the lumbar level of 38.7% of patients (12/31) is less than 2DS. These results indicate the need for active prevention of osteoporosis and fractures inpatients with CCD, ensuring at an early age of suf ï¬cient intakes calcium and vitamin D, but also regular physical activity to allow optimal / maximal bone mass acquisition inadulthood.

SEDC is characterised by dwarï¬sm and skeletal abnormalities caused by mutations of the COL2A1 gene, which prevent bone growth. The mostcommon features of SEDC are skeletal deformities such as short trunk dwar ï¬sm, odontoid hypoplasia, cervical spine subluxation, scoliosis, kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, coxa vara,genu valgum, clubfoot, pes planus and metaphyseal changes. Cervical cord compression is the most hazardous skeletal deformity in patients with SEDC which requiresspecial attention and management. Here, we present a mother and a son with SEDC due to a novel heterozygous mutation in SEDC.

The mother has disproportionate short stature, facial dysmorphic features and operation scar due to hip dislocation. Her X ray showed platyspondyly,kyphosis, scoliosis, coxa vara and ï¬attened epiphyses. Results: Next generation sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq (v1.9) platform using the virtual panel forskeletal dysplasia consisting of 130 genes.

30244,"Introduction: Collagenopathies type II are rare autosomal dominant conditions characterized by skeletal dysplasia, short stature and sensorial defects. More than 400heterozygous mutations in type II collagen gene COL2A1 have been identi ï¬ed, but only 5 of them are found in patients with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Strudwicktype (SEMD S), a rare phenotype of intermediate severity. We present a female patient with SEMD S phenotype and a novel mutation in the COL2A1 gene. Patients and Methods: The patient presented at birth with severe short trunk short limb dwar ï¬sm, short chest, coxa vara, clubfoot, cleft palate, conductive hearing lossand mild external hydrocephalus. Metaphyseal irregularities permitted clinical differentiation from SED congenita. Now, at the age of 7 years, her stature is signi ï¬cantly reduced and a waddling gait, genu valgum and lumbar lordosis devel oped. Hands and feet are normal. The genomic DNA from blood leukocytes of the patient was isolated and NextGeneration Sequencing (NGS) analysis was done focusing on about 200 genes associated with skeletal dysplasias. Results: NGS revealed a novel heterozygous missense variant (c.2177G>A, p. Gly726Asp) in exon 33 of the COL2A1 gene, categorised as likely pathogenic accordingto ACMG/AMP classi ï¬cation. As glycine substitutions are typical for SEMD S patients, it is highly probable that the identi ï¬ed variant is causative of the SEMD S phenotype. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this missense variant in COL2A1 has not been reported before. It extends the mutational spectrum allowing for better genotype/pheno type correlation in patients with SEMD S. Molecular genetic analysis is helpful for the diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias with overlapping phenotypes. M. Kero: None. A. Mea Å¡iÄ:None. A. Bobinec: None. I. SansoviÄ:None. I.

30245,"2Stanford Children's Health, Palo Alto, CA, United States COL4A2 encodes the Î±2 chain of type IV collagen, which assembles into heterotrimers with COL4A1 chains to form a component of the basal membrane. Heterozygous variantsinCOL4A2 have been described in fewer than 20 families in association with familial cerebrovascular disease manifest ing as porencephaly and intracerebral hemorrhage. Seizures,cortical malformations, lens opacities, hematuria and elevated creatine kinase have been reported. We present a 4 1/2 year old male with ischemic stroke and deep veinthrombosis, intracranial hemorrhage, systemic arterial involvement (tapering of the abdominal aorta, occlusion of the left common iliac artery, small right iliac artery andcollaterals of the upper extremities) and mildly dilated aortic root and ascending aorta. Whole exome sequencing reported a maternally inherited variant in COL4A2 (c.1396G>A, p. G466S). This variant is not reported in ClinVar but is reported in gnomAD with an allele frequency of 5.0x10 5. In silico models predict this variant to be damaging. The patient âs mother is asymptomatic; brain MRI, echocardiogram and ophthalmology examinations are being coordinated. While intracranial hemorrhage has alsobeen seen in other patients with COL4A2 variants, systemic arteriopathy and mild enlargement of the aortic root have not been previously described.

CB is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that usuallypresents with lamellar ichthyosis (LI) or congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE). Other less common disorders as self improving collodion ichthyosis, Nethertonsyndrome, Gaucher disease type 2, Chanarin Dorfman syndrome, ectodermal dysplasia or SjÃ¶gren Larsson syn drome may also be responsible for this phenotype. Materials and Methods: Clinical exome sequencing (CES) was performed in 4 patients with referral diagnosis of CB using Illumina TruSight One Kit. Results: CES analysis revealed mutations in ALOX12B, SPINK5, NIPAL4 andTGM1 genes. In patient 1 (P1), we found a homozygous mutation in the ALOX12B gene, known to cause self improving collodion ichthyosis. This was consistent with a rapid resolution of almost all skin lesions. P2 and P3 developed Netherton syndrome. In P2compound heterozygous mutations in the SPINK5 gene conï¬rmed the diagnosis. In P3 no causative genetic varia tions were found. In P4, presenting with CB evolving to LI,we detected two heterozygous variants, one in NIPAL4 gene (likely pathogenic) and other in TGM1 (uncertain signiï¬cance). Conclusion: Clinical evolution of CB is hard to predict as clinical presentation and severity may vary from mild to life threatening. CES provided a timely and precise diag nosis in most of our patients which is important for treat ment planning, disease prognosis and genetic counselling of affected families. A. Bobinec: None. A.

The role ofinterleukin 11 receptor, alpha (IL11RA), a cell derived cytokine, has been evidenced in the pathogenesis of multiple synostosis with autosomal recessive inheritancepattern (Craniosynostosis and dental anomalies, OMIM#614188). A Crouzon like appearance with different types of craniosynostosis has been observed. Several causalmissense and truncating variants have been reported. We present three additional cases with homozygous novel pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in IL11RA (NM_001142784.2: c.598C>A, p. Pro200Thr; c.696C>A, p. Tyr232*; c.866A>G, p. His289Arg). All three patients presented with high intracranial pressure, a Crouzon likephenotype and early closure of all cranial sutures (pansy nostosis). Our cases, together with previous reports of IL11RA related pansynostosis, suggest a key regulator role for IL11RA in the morphogenesis and maintenance of patency of all cranial sutures. A.

Routine diagnostic screening of common craniosynostosis associated genes enables to establishgenetic aetiology in 21% to 62% depending on the size of the study, ethnicity of the population, and range of the molecular analysis. Materials and Methods: We performed targeted next generation sequencing in a group of 60 patients manifesting CS with negative results of molecular screening. We havedesigned a custom hybridisation based panel, encompassing 61 genes and 11 SNPs chosen based on current knowledge about variants involved in craniofacial development usingonline databases. We sequenced captured and indexed libraries on Ion Torrent S5 sequencing system. Results: This approach revealed pathogenic variants or probably pathogenic variants among patients presenting with different forms of CS. We found pathogenic and probably pathogenic variants or variants of unknown sig niï¬cance within the ALX4 ,BMP4 ,CYP26B1 ,EDN3 , EFNB1 ,EFTUD2 ,FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, IFT122 , IFT140 ,IHH, MEGF8 ,RECQL4 ,RUNX2 ,SKI, TCF12 genes.

Notably, the C allele for this variant was over transmitted in mNCSprobands, whereas the A allele was over transmitted in sNCS probands. Functional assessment of rs6127972 using western blot and ELISA showed no difference in BMP7 expression or protein levels in synostotic metopic versus open sutures. Data from luciferase studies suggested that the locus may act as a repressor element with the risk alleleexerting stronger repression. Zebra ï¬sh transgenic analysis produced inconclusive results. Our ï¬ndings implicate the BMP/TGF Î²signaling pathway in midline NCS and support the role of BBS9 locus in the etiology of metopic craniosynostosis. [Grants NIH X01HG008936 and R01DE016886] C. M.

Usually the mechanisms explaining the non penetrance are not understood, with few epistatically interacting genetic fac tors described in humans. One recent example of such a âtwo locus âmodel is the proposal by Timberlake et al (eLife , 2016) of an interaction of SMAD6 variants in midline craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the metopic and/or sagittal cranial sutures of the skull) with a common polymorphism near BMP2 , to explain frequent non penetrance in the parent transmitting the SMAD6 variant. We aimed (i) to validate the ï¬ndings in an independent, larger cohort, and (ii) to delineate the phenotype associatedwith SMAD6 variants. We performed NGS based resequen cing of multiplexed PCR products of SMAD6 in 800 unsolved patients with any type of craniosynostosis, andgenotyped the rs1884302 BMP2 polymorphism in SMAD6 positive individuals. We identi ï¬ed 18 different rare damaging SMAD6 variants (2.25% overall), with the highest prevalence in metopic synostosis (~6%) and a ~23 fold enrichment of loss of function variants compared to gnomAD data (P<0.00001). This con ï¬rms that SMAD6 variants increase the risk of craniosynostosis (especially metopic). Combining these data with a further 6 indepen dently identi ï¬ed variants, 17/24 were transmitted from an unaffected parent but the BMP2 genotype did not correlate with presence/absence of craniosynostosis. Hence furtherAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1277work is needed to identify the factors accounting for reduced penetrance of SMAD6 variants both in craniosy nostosis, and in the panoply of other phenotypes (including congenital heart disease, thoracic aortic aneurysm and intellectual disability), with which SMAD6 variants have been associated.

Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in known craniosynostosis genes i.e. FGFR2, FGFR3 and TWIST1 account for only 20% of cases. Besides these SNVs, a signi ï¬cant subgroup (15%) of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis show chromoso mal rearrangements. Due to the small number of patientswith identical chromosomal aberrations reported in the literature, it is often dif ï¬cult to determine the critical region/ gene which contributes to the phenotype and perform aspeciï¬c diagnostic analysis. Thus, aCGH was chosen as genome wide CNV screening approach for identi ï¬cation of CNVs in a cohort of 33 craniosynostosis patients. In total we detected likely pathogenic CNVs in 18% of our cohort. These CNVs encompass known craniosynos tosis genes like MSX2 andTCF12 and novel craniosynos tosis candidate genes, respectively. Three patients carried unbalanced translocations and in additional three cases we detected interstitial gains and losses. Clinically thesepatients presented with isolated as well as syndromic forms of craniosynostosis. Our results emphasize the importance of chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs as a genetic cause of craniosy nostosis, particularly in case of unclear syndromeclassi ï¬cation due to clinical variability. Furthermore, genes which reside in or are disrupted by rare CNVs represent candidate genes for craniosynostosis. In addition to sequencing approaches CNV screening methods like aCGH should be included in the genetic testing algorithm for craniosynostosis patients. This willenable diagnosis in a signi ï¬cant portion of yet unsolved syndromic as well as non syndromic cases. E. KÃ¶nig: None. E. Kunstmann: None. A. QuattlÃ¤n der: None. T. Schweitzer: None. E.

The phenotype in this patient re ï¬ects the skeletal dysplasia of Csgalnact1 / mice and resembles the clinical and radiographic picture of a milder spectrum of Desbuquois dysplasia (Vodopiutz et al., 2017). CSGALNACT1 encodes chondroitin sulfate N acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGalNAcT 1, ChGn 1) which has a critical role in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Here we report on a 12 years old boy born from consanguineous parents with a mild skeletal dysplasia, short stature ( 3SD), and joint laxity. Psychomotor devel opment was normal. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous 1bp deletion in CSGALNACT1 (c.372del, p. (His125Thrfs*9)). Segregation analysis con ï¬rmed both parents as heterozygous carriers. The identi ï¬ed variant is neither reported in gnomAD and dbSNP nor in the literature. It leads to a frameshift and premature stop codonand, thus, with high probability to loss of function of the corresponding protein. This is the second report of a patient with biallelic loss of function mutations inCSGALNACT1 which underlines its role in mild skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint laxity without obvious additional organ manifestations and normal psychomotordevelopment.

The genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of this group of disorders is tremendous involving more than 300 genes that are responsible for more than 450 distinct conditions. One of them, Desbuquois syndrome dysplasia (DBQD) is a rareskeletal osteochondrodysplasia characterized by severe micromelic dwar ï¬sm, joint laxity with multiple joint dislocations, speci ï¬c radiographic ï¬ndings features and facial dysmorphism. DBQD is a very severe and often sometime lethal form of micromelic dwar ï¬sm. We report here a case for which whole exome sequencing allowed toperform an early prenatal diagnosis before the occurrence of characteristic ultrasound signs. Indeed, at 21 WG, the ultrasound scan con ï¬rmed that the fetus was very likely affected with an osteochondrodysplasia because all bio metric parameters were below 4 SD associated with bilateral vertical talus. However, it was impossible, at thattime, to pinpoint the exact diagnosis. Using exome sequencing, we evidenced two variants in CANT1 , the gene responsible for DBDQ. The parents were informed that thefetus was very likely affected with DBQD at a gestational age of 24 weeks. The present case, is to our knowledge, the ï¬rst one in whom a molecular prenatal diagnosis of DBQD is performed in the absence of relevant family history and before the appearance of evocative sonographic features.

It is considered as the most severe form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) due to the high mortality rate associated with the fragility ofarteries and internal organs. Common symptoms include thin, translucent skin; easy bruising; characteristic facial appearance; and fragile arteries, muscles and internalorgans. Treatment and management options are limited and focused on preventing serious complications. Here we present a 5 years old female with vascular type EDS due toa novel heterozygous mutation COL3A1 . Materials and Methods: The patient was the ï¬rst child of non consanguineous healthy parents, born at term with abirth weight of 2600gr (3 10th centile). Easly bruising even with small traumas have been noticed from the infancy period. She also had dif ï¬culty in wound healing. Physical examination revealed wide forehead, deep set eyes, thin translucent skin with multiple bruising and atrophic scars, joint laxity, and profound super ï¬cial veins. Results: Next generation sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq(v1.9) platform using the virtual panel for collagenopathy consisting of 51 genes. The heterozygousvariant in COL3A1 (c.3563G>A) was detected. Segregation within the family showed that the variant is de novo. Conclusions: Although vascular type EDS is a rare genetic disease, it should be kept in mind in patients with easy bruisable skin and atrophic scar. Accurate and early diagnosis have great importance in preventing serious lifethreating complications. N. Agaoglu: None. Y. Kendir demirkol: None. O. Akgun dogan: None. M. Say: None. T.

So far, only rare reports of germline mutations in the EGFR gene as a cause of monogenic disease in children areavailable. Our patient was a young pregnant woman of Roma origin. Her previous pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios and IUGR and her daughter was born inthe 31st week of pregnancy, birth weight 660g. Child had no organ malformation but very fragile skin and died after 46 days because of multiorgan failure. The currentpregnancy was also complicated by severe polyhydramnios, there were hyperechogenic kidneys and bowels and IUGR. The boy was born in the 30th week with birth weight of760g. The boy had progeroid features with lack of subcutaneous fat and very thin and fragile skin. He died in 34 days because of metabolic dysbalance. Whole exomesequencing revealed presence of homozygous mutation c.1283G>A (p. Gly428Asp) in the EGFR gene in both deceased siblings, both parents are heterozygous carriers. Thirteen years ago, we examined Roma family in which 3 children died in early infancy with very similar clinical features. The diagnosis of Netherton syndrome wasconsidered, but wasn't con ï¬rmed. With our new experience we tested mutation of EGFR gene in one of these deceased children. Homozygous mutation c.1283G>A was con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing.

The pattern of the facial clefting and aconstriction ring on the right leg raised the suspicion of amniotic band to be the cause. Trio exome analysis was performed to best possible rule out other causes. Amaternally inherited substitution of glycin to serin in the triple helix domaine (COL3A1:c.2689G>A;p. Gly897Ser) was identi ï¬ed in the COL3A1 gene, raising the suspicion of vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome. The family history was without vascular catastrophes, but one affected had severe bleeding after a gynecological surgery. Some carriers of thevariant had easy bruising, whereas others did not. It is well known that substitutions of glycin to serin in the triple helix domaine lead to a better prognosis and a milder phenotypethan other glycin substitutions in vascular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, which most likely explains the mild vascular phenotype in this family. This case reminds us that somecollagen diseases increase the risk of amniotic banding, the risk being estimated to approximately 1 %. The other way round, the risk of a collagen disease in case of amnioticbanding is to the best of our knowledge unknown. We suggest that genetic analysis for selected collagen diseases should be done in case of amniotic banding. C. R. Fagerberg: None. R. M. Schmidt: None. S. Far holt: None. K. P. SÃ¸rensen: None.",2019

DEB is caused by pathogenic variants in the COL7A1 gene encoding type VII collagen, and can be inherited dominantly or recessively. The structure of COL7A1 makes it an attractive candidate for exon skipping therapy. Recently, we demonstrated promising proof of principle for antisense oligonucleotide (AON) mediated exon skipping as a systemic therapeutic approachfor DEB. However, it is unclear what phenotypic effect may be expected from exon skipping and which patient groups may bene ï¬t the most. Patients and Methods: To answer these questions, we studied new clinical and molecular data on seven patients from the Dutch EB registry and reviewed the literature onpathogenic COL7A1 variants inducing ânatural exon skipping â. Results: We found that the natural skipping of certain exons led to disease in a heterozygous state, while the skipping of other exons only led to disease if combined with a pathogenic variant on the other COL7A1 allele. The dominant DEB phenotypes associated with heterozygous exon skipping could not be distinguished from dominant phenotypes caused by heterozygous COL7A1 variants not inducing exon skipping. Phenotypes associated with reces sive exon skipping mutations were, however, on average relatively mild in the spectrum of recessive DEB. Conclusions: For dominant DEB, AON mediated exon skipping is unlikely to make a clinical difference. In con trast, we anticipate that exon skipping has the potential toinduce a clinically relevant improvement of the devastating recessive DEB phenotype, especially the types caused by bi allelic null variants.

Both MFDs and AFDs result from impaired migration of neural crest cells to the pharyngeal arches and the face during embryogenesis. The mainclinical features observed in affected patients are maxillary, malar and mandibular hypoplasia, cleft palate, and/or ear defects. In AFDs, limb defects are present as an additionalfeature. Materials and Methods: To determine the molecular aetiology of FD, we performed a custom ampli ï¬cation based panel of 37 genes (145.5 kb, 761 amplicons) by next generation sequencing on Ion Torrent S5 sequencing sys tem. We analysed a group of 25 patients affected by vari able forms of FD and validated clinically relevant variants by conventional sequencing in both affected individuals and their parents. Results: Testing with targeted next generation gene panel revealed pathogenic or probably pathogenic variants in 14 out of 25 patients presenting with different forms of FDs. We found either novel or known variants within the ALDH1A1 ,ALX1 ,DHODH ,EFNB1 ,EFTUD2 ,FGFR1 , SF3B4 ,SRCAP ,TCOF1 , and ZSWIM6 genes.

We present four solved cases of autosomal dominant hereditary disorders displaying skin manifestations. Materials and Methods: The cases consist on a 28 yo woman with multiple trichoepitheliomas (Brooke Spiegler syndrome); a 10 yo girl with connective tissue nevi and osteopoikilosis (Buschke Ollendorff syndrome); and two patients with multiple cutaneous leiomyomas (Reed syn drome), a 31 yo woman with cutaneous/uterine leiomyomasand renal cancer and a 38 yo man with cutaneous leio myomas whose mother and sister had uterine lesions. All had a family history of the condition compatible with anautosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Disease associated genes were analysed using PCR and direct sequencing and deletions/duplications were detected by MLPA. Results: Pathogenic mutations were identi ï¬ed in all cases, three of them being novel. Patients with Brooke Spiegler and Buschke Ollendorff syndrome had non sensemutations in respectively CYLD (p. Gly282Ter) and LEMD3 (p. Trp581Ter), while Reed syndrome patients carried complete or partial FHdeletions. This novel partial deletion extends 1.9 kb and its breakpoints are located within exon 2 and intron 2, disrupting the FHgene. Genetic counseling was performed and relatives at risk were offered directmolecular testing. Positive cases were further examined by imaging techniques to assess the presence of other lesions or malignancies.

The poor prognosis is anticipated due to typical features of the syndrome and possible potentially life threatening vascular complication in childhood and atlan toaxial instability. Materials and Methods: We have observed clinical and genealogical examination of two patients (14 month old boy and 11 month old girl) with unusual phenotypes: the evaluation con ï¬rmed following symptoms: generalized muscle hypotonia, progressive kyphoscoliosis, and joint hypermobility. Echocardiogram and hearing was normal. Boyâs ultrasound scan showed expansion of the axillary vein and girl âs one showed ectasia of the internal jugular vein. Patients underwent genetic testing via high throughputsequencing followed by capillary Sanger sequencing. Results: In 2 patients from 2 unrelated Russian families identi ï¬ed homozygosity for a 1 bp insertion within a 5C nucleotide repeat in exon 3 (c.362dupC, NM_017946.2) of theFKBP14 gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon (Glu122ArgfsTer7). Theirunaffected parents were heterozygous of the mutation. Conclusion: Clinicians should give more consideration to rare genetic syndromes, especially in the case of symptomsfrom different clinical areas. Genotype/phenotype associa tion studies will be necessary to elucidate further the cause of the variability of the disease severity. As it has earlyclinical manifestations, FKBP 14 related EDS is still a challenge and the key issue for its effective follow up that includes cardiovascular monitoring that is cerebral, thoracic,abdominal MRA, and cervical dynamic radiograph.

Although research has identi ï¬ed a number of causal genes, genetic etiology in about 50% of HS cases remains unknown. The presentreport describes the identi ï¬cation via whole exome sequencing of ï¬ve different mutations in the gene LSS in three unrelated families with unexplained, potentiallyautosomal recessive HS. Affected individuals showed sparse to absent, lanugo like scalp hair, sparse and brittle eyebrows, sparse eyelashes and body hair. The LSS gene encodes lanosterol synthase (LSS), which is a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. This pathway plays an important role in hair follicle biology. After localizingLSS protein expression in the hair shaft and bulb of the hair follicle, the impact of the mutations on keratinocytes was analyzed using immunoblotting and immuno ï¬uorescence. Interestingly, wild type LSS was localized in the endoplas mic reticulum (ER), whereas mutant LSS proteins were localized in part outside of the ER. A plausible hypothesis isthat this mislocalization has potential deleterious implica tions for hair follicle cells. Immunoblotting revealed no differences in the overall level of wild type and mutantprotein. Analyses of blood cholesterol levels revealed no decrease in cholesterol or cholesterol intermediates, thus supporting the previously proposed hypothesis of analternative cholesterol pathway. The identi ï¬cation of LSS as causal gene for autosomal recessive HS highlights the importance of the cholesterol pathway in hair folliclebiology, and may facilitate novel therapeutic approaches for hair loss disorders in general.

In four cases positive genetic screening of exon 34 of NOTCH2 supported the clinical diagnosis; in one of these cases,mosaicism was demonstrated, which, to our knowledge, has not previously been reported. In one case no genetic testing was performed since the phenotype was de ï¬nite, and the diagnosis in the mother was genetically con ï¬rmed. The age of the patients differs widely from seven to 56 years, allowing a natural history description of the phenotypeassociated with this ultra rare condition. The evolution of the condition is most apparent in the incremental bone loss leading to osteoporosis and the acro osteolysis, both ofwhich contribute signi ï¬cantly to disease burden. L.

30261,"Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany, 2Center for Rare Diseases Bonn, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, potentially life threatening disease with an estimated prevalence of 1:50,000 characterized by recurrent episodes of subcuta neous or submucosal swellings. Transmitted as an auto somal dominant trait, there are ï¬ve types of HAE with known genetic defects. While HAE with decreased C1 Inhibitor can be explained by mutations in SERPING1 , only about 20 25% of the cases of HAE with normal C1 Inhibitor can be explained by mutations in FXII. But two recently discovered mutations in ANGPT1 andPLG have been linked to two further forms of HAE with normal C1 Inhibitor. Despite these successes in identifying causes of HAE, there still remains a signi ï¬cant fraction of patients with the diagnosis of so called HAE with unknown cause (U HAE). Aiming to identify potential new disease causing genes that may play a role in the development or clinicalheterogeneity of HAE, we performed multiplex targeted sequencing using the single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs). Our smMIPs panel comprises 29 genesthat were prioritized by systematic literature research and pathway analysis and are mainly related to known disease causing genes and pathways in HAE. The panel wasestablished on a MiSeq platform where we achieved a coverage â¥100x for 95% of all exons in 27 out of 29 selected genes. Sequencing in our patient cohort of125 HAE patients with U HAE is currently ongoing on a Illumina HiSeq platform and results will be presented at the upcoming conference. C. Mathey: None. C.

ABCC6 has been the only identi ï¬ed gene, but up to 18% of cases remain genetically unsolvedwith one or no pathogenic variant in ABCC6 (Legrand et al, 2017) . The corresponding negative French PXE cases were genetically explored for new PXE gene(s). Methods: Exome sequencing was performed in one ABCC6 negative PXE family with additional features, to search for pathogenic variants. We identi ï¬ed a candidate gene (CG) in a congruent metabolic pathway, and sequenced 46 additional ABCC6 negative PXE index cases (IC). An in vitro biochemical assay was carried out todetermine the pathogenicity of identi ï¬ed missense variants and a clinical description of positive cases was performed to reï¬ne their phenotypic spectrum. Results: Out of 47 PXE IC, 3 harbored 2 pathogenic variants in our CG. Histologically con ï¬rmed skin lesions, and diminished visual acuity due to maculopathy evokedthe diagnosis of PXE. The association with neurological symptoms was strikingly present in the 3 cases, evoking a phenotype of PXE âplusâneurological symptoms. Bio chemical analyses con ï¬rmed loss of activity of the corre sponding mutated enzyme. Conclusion: Our CG is mutated in 6.4% of our unsolved PXE cases and should be systematically sequenced in sus pected PXE cases with neurological ï¬ndings: spastic para plegia, dystonia, cognitive impairment, peripheralneuropathy and brain MRI abnormalities. The mechanism leading to overlapping phenotypes for these 2 genes remains to be explored to explain their role and link inmineralization. A. Legrand: None. A. Mesnil: None. C. Durand: None. C.

Here, we report clinical manifestations in 12 sporadic cases with Ito hypomelanosis and post zygotic mutation of MTOR . We performed exome analysis or ultra deep targeted sequencing of MTOR gene on hypopigmented skin biopsy, and performed precise clinical reappraisal. In two patients, we analyzed the phenotype histologically and ultrastructurally. We identi ï¬ed 9 MTOR post zygotic mutations including six novel. Two were recurrent. Clinically, patients had blaschkolinear hypopigmentation (11/12), epilepsy (9/12),macrocephaly (8/12), hemi hypertrophy (7/12), and severe intellectual disability (7/12), 2 have iria heterochromia, and one nephromegaly. Primary ï¬broblasts (p. Glu2419Lys) showed activation of PIK3K AKT pathway. Skin biopsies showed a decreased number of melanocytes melanosome immaturity in melanocytes and a decreased number ofmelanosomes in keratinocytes in hypopigmented areas. Although somatic MTOR mutations have already been reported in Ito's hypomelanosis, this is the ï¬rst clinical genetic characterization of this association. Neurologically, there are analogies with SKS and hemimegalencephaly. Reduction of intrakeratinocyte melanosomes had alreadybeen reported in Ito's hypomelanosis, but without genetic study results as well as in hypochromic spots of tuberous sclerosis (TS), which is due to mutations of mTORrepressor TSC1/2. We found that tuberous sclerosis and MTOR related hypomelanosis shared common pathophy siology process, with a lack of maturation of melanosomes. Importantly, no renal involvement known in TS has been identi ï¬ed in cases with MTOR mutations. Therapeutic use of rapamycin, a MTOR inhibitor, is therefore possible. V. carmignac: None. A.

The overall prevalence of severe HPP is range from 1/100 000 to1/300 000. Mild forms of HPP are more frequent than severe forms expected prevalence can reach 1/6000 in Western populations. Russian prevalence of mild and severeHPP is still unknown. Genetic analysis provides determin ing of diagnosis in cases with suspected HPP. Materials and Methods: We analyzed genomic DNA samples from 112 unrelated individuals with signs of HPP (low and/or recurrent low levels of ALP, low growth, recurrent fractures and others). Primers âsystem for Sanger sequencing was designed and validated for 2 12 exons of ALPL gene. First exon of this gene was excluded because itâs non coding and GC rich region. Results: Studied group included 66 males and 46 females (mean age 9yo, range from 1 month to 66yo). Low ALP (age and sex dependent reference range) was founded in79% (89/112). We detected 15 pathogenic mutations (13% detection rate): 13 in heterozygous and 2 in compound heterozygous. 3 novel missense variants were founded. Most frequent variant was p. E191K in exon 6. The pre valence of this mutation was 6,25% (7/112) in our study whereas gnomAD prevalence is 0,25%. Conclusions: We presented the data of prevalence mild HPP in Russian cohort of patients with suspected HPP. Mild HPP was founded in 87% positive cases (13/15).Variant p.

Features include benign enchondroma and spindle cell haemangioma, with a recognized increased risk of various malignancies. Fewer than 200 cases have been reported, therefore accurate estimates of malignancyrisk are dif ï¬cult to quantify and recommended surveillance guidelines are not available. IDH1 andIDH2 mutations are also implicated in a variety of other benign and malignanttumours. Recently, the FDA approved speci ï¬cIDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors for use in individuals with relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia. Methods: An adult male was assessed via the Austin Health Clinical Genetics Unit, after he presented with soft palpable lesions on the left upper limb. Imaging and his topathology raised the possibility of Maffucci syndrome. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from surgically resected tissue. Sanger sequencing andDroplet digital PCR analysis of the IDH1 gene was performed. Results: Imaging and histopathology results were vir tually pathognomonic of Maffucci syndrome. We identi ï¬ed a recurrent, somatic mosaic c.394C>T (p. R132C) mutation in exon 5 of IDH1 , in DNA derived from haemangioma tissue (~ 17% mutant allele frequency) that was absent in DNA derived from blood. This mutation is a well established cause of Maffucci syndrome. Conclusion: We present an instructive case of a rare condition, and explore the potential therapeutic bene ï¬ts and risks of IDH1 andIDH2 inhibitors in this disorder.

FBN1 gene mutations lead to MFS and related ï¬brillinopathies. In this work we describe clinical and molecular data of 26 unrelated individuals with suspected MFS who werereferred to our laboratory for FBN1 gene mutation analysis. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA samples and in one case RNA sample isolated from dermal ï¬broblasts were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing methods. Results: We identi ï¬ed 23 causative or potentially cau sative (including variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance) FBN1 variants, seven of them was novel (~30%). About 30% of the cases were sporadic. Missense mutations were detectedin 69.6% (16/23), the majority of them were located in one of the cbEGF motifs and ~70% of them substituted con served cystein residues. Small deletions/duplicationsaccounted for 13% of the cases (3/23), while splice site variants were identi ï¬ed in 17.4% (4/23). In three unrelated patients a low frequency (<1%) recurrent silent variant(c.3294C>T (p. Asp1098 ,) was identi ï¬ed. FBN1 mRNA analysis showed that the mutation does not lead to aberrant splicing, based on available data the variant was classi ï¬ed as benign. Conclusions: FBN1 mutations were associated with MFS in the majority of the patients, in two cases with severe andearly onset manifestation of the syndrome.

Bene1,2 1University of Pecs, Medical School, Clinical Center, Department of Medical Genetics, Pecs, Hungary, 2Szentagothai Research Center, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary Introduction: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant multi system disorder of connective tissue with high clinical heterogeneity. Some characteristic features ofthe syndrome, such as ectopia lentis, long bone overgrowth, a high arched palate, a crowded dentition, scoliosis, kyphosis and arachnodactyly overlap with those seen inhomocystinuria. Co occurrence of these disorders can be observed in a number of patients. MFS is mainly caused by mutations in the ï¬brillin 1 gene ( FBN1) , mapped to chromosome 15q21.1. Majority of classic MFS patients bear small alterations, however, a smaller number of patients have larger genomic rearrangements in FBN1 gene. Materials and Methods: After negative results of sys tematic sequencing of FBN1 ,TGFBR1 andTGFBR2 genes, an MLPA (P065 P066 MRC Holland) analysis was per formed in a 21 years old female patient suffering from Marfan syndrome based on Ghent criteria and homocystinuria. Results: In contrast to the generally detected large dele tions, a novel two exon deletion (exon 46 47) has been observed in our patient. This results in the loss of 31 32 nd calcium binding EGF like domain which is responsible for the development of classic Marfan phenotype. Conclusions: Less than 10% of the disease causing mutations are copy number alterations, in which single or multiple exon deletions can be detected by MLPA in a cost effective manner even in the NGS era. Our case points outthe importance of testing the MFS patients for homo cystinuria, since an elevated level of homocysteine is associated with the risk of severe cardiovascular manifes tations, though at present only a few guidelines recommend testing for homocystinuria.

To our knowledge only seven patients withthis syndrome were reported so far. In all patients mutation in exon 64 of the FBN1 gene was detected. Patients and Methods: We present clinical evaluation of mother and daughter in whom the same mutation Trp2756Ter in exon 64 of the FBN1 gene was detected using next generation sequencing method (NimbleGenSeqCap Target Enrichment Roche) with panel of genes associated with craniosynostosis genes (developed in the Department of Medical Genetics of the Institute of theMother and Child in Warsaw, Poland). Results: Both patients have marfanoid habitus with overgrowth, myopia, archnodactyly, pectus excavatum,hyperextensible joints, scoliosis, dysmorphic features with progeroid facial appearance associated with congenital lipodystrophy. Scaphocephalic head âs shape observed especially in daughter was probably a result of wide fon tanelles and disturbances in cranial sutures fusion in childhood.

The majority of genetic risk loci map to non coding regions of the genome, suggesting thatthe underlying pathomechanisms act through regulatory effects on gene expression. One potential mechanism might be posttranscriptional gene regulation by micro RNAs(miRNA). For nsCL/P, a suitable cellular model are human neural crest cells (hNCCs), the mesenchymal precursor cells that give rise to the majority of cranial cartilage and bones. Methods and Results: We combined array based miRNA pro ï¬ling in hNCC with in house GWAS data to identify candidate miRNAs for nsCL/P. This analysisrevealed miR 149 3p as strong candidate for nsCL/P involvement, based on consistent hNCC expression across replicates and the presence of associated risk variants withinits genomic region. Next, we aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of miR 149 3p in the context of craniofacial development. In vitro , we modi ï¬ed miRNA149 abundance levels in cultured hNCC by overexpression and inhibition assays and monitored the migration behavior of hNCC using scratch assays. We found that inhibition ofmiR 149 3p signi ï¬cantly increases cellular migration of hNCC compared to untreated hNCCs. RNA Seq data at different time points revealed differential expression ofGPC1 and BMP7. To follow up these ï¬ndings, in vivo analyses are currently performed in the zebra ï¬sh. Conclusion: Through integration of large scale genetic data and expression patterns in relevant cell types we here identi ï¬ed a novel regulatory mechanism that is involved in craniofacial development and might be related to the etiol ogy of nsCL/P.

The spectrum of pathogenic variants is large, up to 30% affect splicing. Our diagnostic procedure combines analysis of genomic DNA and cDNA. By cDNA analysis we were able to detect a previouslyundescribed Aluinsertion that was not detected by next generation sequencing (NGS). Patient and Methods: A 44 year old patient presented with cafÃ© au lait spots, multiple subcutaneous nodules, vertebral neuro ï¬broma, multiple iris hamartoma and chor oidal nevi. DNA was ï¬rst analyzed by a targeted capture based NGS panel ( NF1,NF2 and SPRED1 ) and MLPA analysis ( NF1 andNF2) with normal results. Heparin blood was used for cDNA analysis. Genetic analysis was per formed on RNA extracted from short term lymphocyte culture; puromycine was used to prevent mRNA decay. Result: cDNA sequencing revealed a deletion of exon 26 (r.3315_3496del, p.(Tyr1106Leufs*28); NM_001042492.2). Extended DNA analysis of exon 26 andï¬anking regions by Sanger sequencing showed inser tion of a truncated AluY transposable element in exon 26: c.3337_3338insAluY,3327_3337dupATTTATGAACC. The insertion leads to disruption of the 3 âacceptor splice site in exon 26, deletion of exon 26 results in reading frame shift and premature stop codon. Retrospective analysis of NGS data indicated a loss of coverage in this speci ï¬c region. Conclusion: While NGS is a powerful method it has limitations in detection of more uncommon variants. In NF1 genetic diagnostics, cDNA sequencing remains the gold standard for mutation detection, speci ï¬cally for variants affecting splicing. C. Schmidt: None. W. Brechan: None. K. Tveten: None. T.

Epidemiologicalobservations suggest that a fraction of the unidenti ï¬ed heritability might be explained by rare dominant de novo mutations (DNMs) in genes involved in craniofacialdevelopment. If highly penetrant, such DNMs may be of relevance in a diagnostic setting and for genetic counselling. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1289We performed whole exome sequencing in 50 trios (discovery cohort) and identi ï¬ed 33 rare protein altering DNMs in 33 âcandidate genes â, two of them previously found associated with nsCL/P ( CDH1, TRMO ). Of note, this is the ï¬rst study in nsCL/P trios using DNMs for can didate gene identi ï¬cation. The âcandidate genes âwere subjected to resequencing with single molecule molecular inversion probes in 1,010 nsCL/P patients from European, Arabian, and Mexicanancestry and 1,574 population matched controls (replication cohort). Of the total callset of 2,956 variants, 373 were absent from controls and showed CADD â¥15 and MAF â¤0.1% in public reference datasets. As a ï¬rst step, we performed segregation analysis in the European cohort. Here, we could identify further DNMs in four of the genes(CSMD1 ,MDN1 ,ANK1 ,PAXIP1 ). In those genes we also found co segregating variants ( MDN1, CSMD1 ) and one compound heterozygous index ( MDN1 ). RNA sequencing datasets con ï¬rmed expression of MDN1 ,ANK1 and PAXIP1 in relevant embryonic mouse tissues and human neural crest cells, making those genes promising candidatesfor functional follow up.

OA is a highly heterogeneous condition, with a wide range age of onset. Non syndromic early onset OA (EO OA) is very rare and mainly familial. Strict inclusion criteria for EO OA are based on: XRays evidence, body mass index (BMI) â¤30, age of onset â¤40y, â¥1 joint site involved and positive familial history. Although multifactorial mode of inheritance is common in OA, EO OA are mainly monogenic conditions. Based onthese data, we aimed to study the monogenic causes of non syndromic EO OA in French patients. Materials and Methods: From 2013 to 2018, clinician experts in the ï¬eld of skeletal dysplasia referred EO OA patients to our Montpellier competence center, which assessed the diagnostic and excluded chondrodysplasia,based on clinical and radiological data. For genetic analysis, we used either Sanger sequencing or an NGS custom panel approach. Results: We recruited 40 EO OA patients, with a mean age of onset of articular pain at 23 years, ranging from 7 to 60 years. Pathogenic or a likely pathogenic heterozygousmutations were identi ï¬ed in 14/40 cases (35%), with 11/14 COL2A1 mutation (78.6%). We also observed a genetic heterogeneity involving COL11A2 ,COL9A3 , and surpris ingly a homozygous pathogenic variation in SLC26A2 . Familial segregation of COL2A1 pathogenic variants was observed for 6 cases. Conclusions: We con ï¬rmed that COL2A1 is the most common genetic cause of familial EO OA. However, at least three other genes are involve in EO OA. Therefore, werecommend to screen genes involved in cartilage matrix and homeostasis. V. Ruault: None. D. Genevieve: None. F. Blotman: None.

Joint shape is commonly used to predict OA. GWAs have rapidlyincreased the number of OA associated genes. Despite few genes were linked to shape variation, evidence for causality and functionality or their effect on joint shape are stilllacking. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop rapid and alternative screening platforms to test OA genes. We use the zebra ï¬sh jaw joint (JJ) to investigate the impact of OA genes and ageing on joint shape variation. 3D morphometrics showed shape abnormalities in aged JJ, accompanied by OA histopathological signs. Interestingly,such modi ï¬cations were prematurely found in OA mutants (chsy1 ,col9a1 ,col11a2 , and wnt16 ). We investigated if shape changes would be detected during JJ ontogeny bytesting a broader list of OA mutants ( chsy1 ,col9a1 , col11a2 ,gdf5,barx1 ,mcf2l ,dot1l ,wnt16 andncoa3 ) using confocal imaging of larvae immunostained for collagen type2 followed by 2D and 3D analysis. Distinct classes of OA proteins leaded to signi ï¬cant shape variation in larvae, mostly explained by abnormal cell behaviour and collagendistribution. Dramatic shape variation caused joint move ment impairment. We tested whether the use of mosaics, CRISPR G0s, could be suf ï¬cient to detect shape and cell changes. Surprisingly, wnt16 mosaics and wnt16 / dis played similar cellular and shape changes in larvae and adults. By developing computational tools to facilitate 3Danalysis we delivered a powerful and rapid screening platform to test OA genes. Versus Arthritis (grants 19497, 21161) E. Kague: None. F.

The diversity of clinical features and its severity varies between patients, even within a single family, ranging from severe perinatal lethal to a mild form. The aim of this project was to determine genetic hetero geneity versus clinical variability observed in patientsaffected by OI. Materials and Methods: NGS using custom panel of 34 genes with con ï¬rmed and probable signi ï¬cance in OI pathogenesis was performed. The study included 118 patients, aged 1 44 years, presenting a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation. Based on bioinformatic analysis,selected variants were veri ï¬ed with Sanger sequencing in a group of 77 patients. Results: We have identi ï¬edCOL1A1 mutations in 47 patients, COL1A2 in 24 patients and mutations in 3 non collagenous genes in 6 patients. A total of 41 different point mutations in COL1A1 and 20 in COL1A2 were found. Respectively 15 and 11 have not been reported in dedicated Osteogenesis Imperfecta Variant Database. We also repor ted patient with a deletion spanning 25 exons in COL1A1 gene. Thus far expected lethality of particular domains in collagen type I genes revealed to be dubious, as we iden tiï¬ed 11 patients aged 1,5 to 38 years with pathogenic mutations situated in these regions.

Although mutations in COL1A1/2 account for 90% of cases, up to 17 different genes were associated with OI. Our aim was to characterizethe clinical and mutational spectrum of OI in Portugal and to correlate genotype and phenotype. Materials and Methods: Clinical data of 201 OI indi viduals (135 adults, 58 children, and 8 fetuses) from 157 families were collected through clinical evaluation and/or medical records analysis. Sanger and/or different NGSbased strategies and MLPA ( COL1A1/2 ) were used for molecular analysis. Results: One hundred thirty seven individuals had mild, 31 moderate, 24 severe, and 9 extremely severe OI. A total of 123 different variants (65 novel) were identi ï¬ed. Variants inCOL1A1 (n,91, including one multi exonic deletion) and COL1A2 (n,29, including one homozygous case) account for 85.1% of all molecularly diagnosed families (66 with quantitative and 48 with qualitative variants), followedbySERPINF1 (n,4), LRP5 (n,4), IFITM5 (n,3), FKBP10 (n,3),WNT1 (n,2),CRTAP (n,1),TMEM38B (n,1),P3H1 (n,1),PPIB (n,1), and BMP1 (n,1). Interestingly, heterozygous variants in severe autosomal recessive OI genes were found in 3 patients with mild OI. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst large scale study on OI in Portugal. In accordance with other populations, quantitative variants predominate in mild COL1A1/2 cases, and IFITM5and FKBP10 related cases had recognizable phenotypes. The identi ï¬cation of a homozygous variant in COL1A2 and heterozygous variants in autosomal recessive genes com plicate genetic counselling. No variant was identi ï¬ed in 6.5% of probands. A. M.

30275,"Daire1,2 1Department of genetics, Necker Hospital, Paris, France, 2INSERM UMR1163, Paris Descartes University, Imagine Institute, Paris, France Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by bone fragility. An important clinical heterogeneity exists ranging from severe antenatal letalform to mild postnatal affection. For now, 19 genes are known to be responsible for OI: 3 dominant autosomal forms (COL1A1, COL1A2 and IFITM5), 14 recessiveautosomal forms and 2 X linked forms (PLS3, MBTPS2). Importance of a proper molecular diagnosis for genetic counseling led us to design a panel of targeted resequencingof the 19 gene coding regions, substituting for the former Sanger analyses. Some genes implicated in differential diagnoses like hypophosphatasia or overlapping phenotypeswere added, increasing to 39 the total number of genes. All requests were submitted to the Reference Center for Constitutional Bone Diseases with clinical and radiologicaldetails. Libraries were prepared using capture technology (SureSelectXT Custom Agilent) and medium throughput sequencing on a NextSEq sequencer (Illumina). Since 2015,368 mutations were identi ï¬ed in 517 patients (71%): 187 in the COL1A1 gene (50%), 98 in the COL1A2 gene (26%),129215 in IFITM5 (4%), 48 in recessive genes responsible for OI (13%), 3 in X linked gene. All these mutations were conï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. The results are discussed during a feedback meeting with clinicians and biologists. This panel allows ef ï¬cient screening for all OI genes, leading to time and cost savings. Using a panel strategyavoid incidental ï¬ndings. The main limit is the occasional difï¬culty to determine the pathogenicity of the identi ï¬ed variant. Whole exome sequencing analysis can be proposedfor patient without mutation. S. Monnot: None.

OI is characterized by bone fragility and fractures, bone deformities, short stature, dentinogenesis imperfecta, hearing loss, and blue sclerae. The phenotype is highly variable, from mild to perinatal lethal. Osteoporosis is a common, multifactorial disorder, characterized by reduced bone mass and fractures. A fewgenes have been associated with (early onset) monogenetic non syndromic osteoporosis (OP). Here we present the results of the analysis of a panel of 19 OI/OP related genesin 550 patients referred with OI, OP or a related disorder. Material and Methods: A solution based enrichment kit was designed to capture exons and splice sites of the targetgenes. Data were analysed using an in house pipeline and Cartagenia, and an NGS based CNV analysis tool. 68% of the patients (mean age 37y) had osteoporosis and/or frac tures; no additional OI related features were reported (OP cohort). 23% of the patients (mean age 22y) had at least one other OI related symptom reported (OI cohort). Results Diagnosis was molecularly con ï¬rmed in 67% of the patients in the OI cohort, versus 6% in the OP cohort. In the OP cohort, a suspicious VUS was identi ï¬ed in 12% of the patients. Variant distribution among genes was different between OI and OP cohorts. Conclusions: As expected, the yield of genetic testing was signi ï¬cantly higher in the OI cohort versus the OP cohort. However, the proportion of patients with a (poten tial) genetic cause in the OP cohort is relevant and warrantsfurther investigation of these patients. A. Maugeri: None. E. Voorhoeve: None. N. M.

Though the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the classic clinical and radiologicalï¬ndings, it is often missed due to variable presentations PHO is characterized by digital clubbing, periostosis, acroosteolysis, painful joint enlargement, and skin mani festations that include thickened facial skin, a thickened scalp, and coarse facial features. The disorder has estimated prevalence of 0.16%, and usually manifests in adolescence,occurring almost exclusively in males, with a M: F ratio of 7:1. Materials and Methods: We present a 15 years old boy, from Afghanistan, born to consanguine parents who pre sented for the ï¬rst time in our department with painful swelling of hands, feet, and face, coarse facial features,hypertrichosis, short and broad palms, and soles. He reports on elder brother with similar swelling, and alopecia. Radi ological examinations show wide and thick metacarpals,short distal phalanges, square like vertebras. Results: Many tests were performed to rule out lysosomal storage disorders, and skeletal dysplasia. After performingan NGS analysis (clinical exome sequencing), the patient was found to carry, in homozygous state, a new mutation (c.290G>A) in SLCO2A1 gene causing PHO type 2. Conclusions: PDP type 2 has diverse radiological and clinical features. It may remain undiagnosed for long time and progress until there are signi ï¬cant facial, joint, and digital deformities that ï¬nally make the patient seek medical attention. H. M. Kathom: None. D.

Patients mainly suffer from palmoplantar keratosis, periodontitis, and early loss of teeth. The present study is concerned with the dental management of PLS patients through periodontal and prosthetic intervention. Materials and Methods: Nine PLS patients were inclu ded in this study. The patients were referred to our Oro dental Genetics Clinic complaining of early loss of the deciduous dentition and were in different stages of perma nent teeth eruption. Our management protocol included;conventional scaling and root planning every 3 month, diode laser curettage and pocket sterilization monthly ses sions and construction of a removable prosthesis to restorethe lost teeth. Pocket depth, bleeding index and mobility was assessed every 6 month during the 2 year period of the study. Results: All patients showed good response to the laser treatment. Gingival in ï¬ammation was controlled with less bleeding, decreased mobility of teeth and no teeth were lostover 2 years. However, panoramic radiographs showed bone loss in the pocket areas.

Zschocke1 1Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria,2Institut de Biologie Structurale, Grenoble, France Introduction: Periodontal Ehlers âDanlos syndrome (pEDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by early severe periodontitis and various joint and skin manifestations. Most EDS types are caused by mutationsin collagens or protein modifying enzymes. In contrast, periodontal type is caused by heterozygous missense or in frame insertion/deletion mutations in C1R orC1S, indicat ing a previously unknown connection between the in ï¬am matory complement pathway and connective tissue homeostasis. pEDS is autosomal dominant and involvesgain of function effects; loss of function variants in C1R/ C1S are asymptomatic when heterozygous and can cause a lupus like phenotype when homozygous. Methods and Results: In vitro overexpression in HEK293T cells demonstrated that all pathogenic C1R1294variants except a mutant in the C1q binding motif cause abnormal intracellular processing and secretion of enzy matically active serine protease. Unlike C1r wild type, mutations in the CUB1 and CCP1 domains of C1r show intracellular retention of the N terminal fragment. Mutations in the CUB2 domain cause secretion of aggregated N terminal fragments, whereas CCP2 domain mutations induce a new cleavage site. Importantly, the C terminal catalytic fragment from all C1r mutants was secreted andenzymatically active in the supernatant. Western blot ana lysis of patient derived skin and gingival ï¬broblasts con ï¬rmed aberrant activation and secretion of mutated C1r even in the presence of C1s and C1 inhibitor. C1s activation was con ï¬rmed by in vitro complement activation assays. Conclusion: pEDS is caused by gain of function muta tions that cause abnormal activation of complement 1 independent of microbial triggers. We hypothesize that secreted catalytic fragments cleave extracellular matrixproteins with adverse consequences on connective tissue homeostasis. Funded by FWF I 2909 B30.R. GrÃ¶bner: None. E.

BruckSyndrome (BS) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by OI with congenital contractures due to mutations in FKPB10 and PLOD2 genes (BS1 and BS2 respectively). FKPB10 mutations were found to cause moderately severe OI type XI and PLOD2 was reported before to cause fractures without contractures. Herein wepresent two patients from two Egyptian families with recurrent fractures but without joint contractures having PLOD2 mutations. Materials and Methods: two unrelated Egyptian con sanguineous families with repeated fractures were studied. Mutation analysis was performed using NGS panel, homozygosity mapping, then candidate gene approach. Results: theï¬rst family included a 15 years male who presented with repeated fractures around 10 times/year, deformities and severe kyphoscoliosis (clinical severity score; CSS 17). The second family had a 9 years old girlmilder in severity with 1 2 fractures/year (CSS 14). Both patients had no joint contractures. They were short and had Wormian bones in their skull x rays and osteoporosis con ï¬rmed by DEXA. Molecular testing for both patients revealed homozygous donor splice site mutation in PLOD2 in intron 12(c.1358 +5G>A). The mutation was hetero zygous in the parents. Conclusion: This study and previous reports from other centers identi ï¬ed different PLOD2 mutations with repeated fractures and variable severity but without contractures and this expands the phenotypic spectrum of PLOD2 associated mutations. Accordingly, it âs important to reconsider the current classi ï¬cation to include BS as a variant of OI sub types rather than being a separate syndrome. G. A. Otaify: None. V. Ruiz Perez: None. P.

GNAS inactivation disorders are a heterogeneous group of rare disorders caused by mutations and methylation defects. These are divided into pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) types 1a and 1b, pseudo pseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), and progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH),depending on the presence or absence of hormone resistance, Albright âs hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), and ectopic ossi ï¬cation. This study analyzed the clinical characteristics and molecular genetic backgrounds of 18 Korean patients from 16 families with a genetically conï¬rmed GNAS defect. Auxological parameters, AHO phenotypes, types of hormonal resistance, family history, and molecular genetic disturbances were reviewed retro spectively. Nine (90%) patients with PHP1a showedresistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and all patients showed elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at diagnosis. Eight (80%) patients were managed withlevothyroxine supplementation. Three of six patients with PHP1b had elevated TSH levels, but none of whom neededAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1295levothyroxine medication. AHO features were absent in PHP1b. Patients with PPHP and POH did not show any hormone resistance. Among the 11 families with PHP1a, PPHP, and POH, eight different (three novel) mutations in theGNAS gene were identi ï¬ed. Among the six patients with PHP1b, two were sporadic cases and four were familialcases. This, the largest single center series study of GNAS inactivation disorders in Korea, summarizes the detailed clinical and molecular genetic characteristics of these diseases. Identi ï¬cation of molecular genetic backgrounds, along with clinical phenotypes, enables appropriate man agement and proper genetic counseling. J. Ko: None. S. Han: None. Y. Lee: None. C.

Vanakker1,2 1Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium,2Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium Introduction: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an ectopic mineralization disease due to biallelic ABCC6 mutations. As no curative therapy is available, we characterized a zebra ï¬shabcc6a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout model ( Cmg52 ) for drug screening purposes, identifying spinal hypermineralization as an early, quanti ï¬able pheno type. As a proof of concept we tested our screeningworkï¬ow on two compounds (80Î¼M Vitamin K1 [VK1] and 30Î¼M Sodium Thiosulfate [STS]), both implicated in PXE. Materials and Methods: Following Cmg52 +/ incross, Cmg52+/+,Cmg52+/ andCmg52 / embryos were collected. At 3 days post fertilization (dpf), embryos are distributedper 20 in baskets. From 3 10dpf, 60 embryos are treated with 8ml compound in 1x E3 medium and refreshed daily. Following euthanasia at 10dpf, embryos are ï¬xed, bleached and stained for mineralization. Photos are taken of embryos under identical conditions and via ImageJ mineralization is quanti ï¬ed. DNA is extracted from embryos and miner alization values are linked to respective genotypes for sta tistical analysis. Results: VK1 signi ï¬cantly reduced spinal mineralization inCmg52 / ([Mean Â± SD] Controls: 19.371 Â± 12.794; VK1: 10.322 Â± 5.519; P<0.05). STS treated larvae had no spinal mineralization or higher mortality compared to controls. However, 33% of STS treated animals had spottyabdominal mineralization regardless of genotype, indicating putative toxicity. Conclusions: We con ï¬rmed the Cmg52 / mineralization phenotype to be a good read out for compound screening. Our data suggests a role for VK1 in PXE pathogenesis though further validation is required. The STS data under scores the importance of proper controls and that compound screening data need to be interpreted cautiously. M. Van Gils: None. A. Willaert: None. P. J. Coucke: None. O. M.

Kannu1 1Division of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, Toronto, ON, Canada,2The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada Introduction: Homozygous missense mutations in the CYP26B1 gene, have been described in very few indivi duals with phenotypes ranging from a lethal generalised skeletal dysplasia characterised by severe skull defects and craniosynostosis, radiohumeral fusions, oligodactyly andnarrow thorax to a milder presentation described in one adult affected by multiple craniosynostosis, characteristic facies, radiohumeral joint limitation, hearing loss andintellectual disability. The enzyme coded by CYP26B1 is involved in retinoic acid catabolism and regulates its precise temporo spatial gradient during embryogenesis. Case pre sentation: We describe a healthy non consanguineous couple with 2 children with distinctive craniofacial features including turribrachycephaly, shallow orbits, malar hypo plasia, low set and protruding ears, small mouth, high palate with crowding teeth and pointy chin. Both siblings have bilateral conductive hearing loss, arachnodactyly, reducedmovement of the radio ulnar joints and mild to moderate learning disability. Their phenotype resembles that of the reported adult. Results: Whole exome sequencing revealed both sibs inherited two missense mutations in trans affecting CYP26B1 . Variant c.353C>T (p. P118L) was paternally inherited, not previously described and not seen in large population cohorts, and variant c.701G>A (p. R234Q), with frequency of 0.06% in large databases, was maternallyinherited. Both variants were predicted to have a deleterious impact on the protein structure. Conclusion: Our patients add to the wide phenotypic constellation seen with CYP26B1 pathogenic variants. We infer that higher retained enzyme activity is non lethal and1296mostly associated with skeletal and neurological features including characteristic craniofacial features resembling craniosynostosis, hearing loss and intellectual disability.

In the absence of consensus international guidelines on genetic testing for SS, various clinical criteria are used to inform appropriate testing. The extent of geneticheterogeneity and complexity of SS are still being elucidated, challenging diagnostic approaches. Materials and Methods: We employed a retrospective analysis of diagnostic genomics yield for SS patients receiving growth hormone therapy on the Western Aus tralian Paediatric Endocrine Database. In addition, a pro spective systematic study using chromosomal microarray and a clinical exome panel on cases with unknown genetic aetiology was initiated in 2018. Results: A major genetic aetiology was identi ï¬ed in ~31% of cases prior to the systematic application of con temporary genomic technologies (35 out of 114 participantsborn since 2005 and receiving growth hormone for >2 years). Presence of composite genomic ï¬ndings in some patients challenged interpretation. Referral to a local inter disciplinary undiagnosed disease program helped in resol ving the diagnostic odyssey for complex patients. Conclusions: Diagnostic genomics applications for SS are still evolving and some of the challenges can be over come by pre test clinical selection, detailed phenotyping and contribution of an inter disciplinary team input.

Deletions removing the gene or enhancers and nonsense/frameshift mutations represent a well established cause of disease. Otherwise,rearrangements not encompassing any described enhancer and 5 âUTR variations are also identi ï¬ed in patients but their pathogenic role remains unclear. During diagnostic screen ing performed on 934 patients by standard methods (MLPA and sequencing) we identi ï¬edSHOX alterations in 82 patients (8.8%). Among these, 65 (78%) carried deletionswhile 17 (22%) point mutations. Besides these pathogenic mutations we also identi ï¬ed small deletions not encom passing any already described enhancer (n ,11) and variations within 5 âUTR (n ,5) in 24 LWD/ISS patients whose pathogenic role was less clear that were classi ï¬ed as VOUS. The aim of this work was to investigate throughfunctional studies the pathogenic role of these variations. To better characterize the deletions not encompassing the enhancers we used a ï¬ne tiling custom aCGH and performed in vitro functional assays to assess the potential enhancer activity of conserved sequences within the deleted areas. The variants within the 5 âUTR were tested for their ability to interfere with correct gene expression. Our results showed that some of the VOUS might be responsible of SHOX deï¬ciency either by removing putative regulatory elements or affecting the proximal promoter activity. In conclusion, the present study allowed us to reclassify as likely pathogenic some of the novel variants of uncertainsigniï¬cance, that we detected in the diagnostic screening, thus reducing them of at least 10%.A.

We report a case of a skeletal dysplasia with inconclusive pathological and radiological features anda missense change in SLC35D1 . Material and Methods: A consanguineous family had 4 pregnancies affected by a skeletal dysplasia. Insuf ï¬cient DNA from the 4 pregnancies meant that exome couple analysis was undertaken on the parents followed by in silico protein modelling using Phyre2 web and I TASSER ser vers. Functional effects of variants were assessed using a proteo liposome assay (Rautengarten et al., 2014 PNAS 111: 11563 11568). Results: Both parents were heterozygous for a missense change in SLC35D1 c.398C>T p.(Pro133Leu). Reappraisal of the radiographs was consistent with schneckenbecken like dysplasia. Testing of one of the fetuses and 2 healthy unaffected siblings was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance but not suf ï¬cient to con ï¬rm pathogenicity. In silico protein modelling showed that p. Pro133 lies directly opposite p. Thr65, the site of the only previously reported1298pathogenic missense variant, at the mouth of the solute channel, implying pathogenicity. The prote liposome assay demonstrated 2 4% in transport activity compared to wild type but also showed SCLD231 is a general UDP sugar transporter with clear activity towards UDP Xylose, sug gesting a mechanism by which the Golgi synthesized sub strate can be imported into the endoplasmic reticulum for essential xylosylation reactions. Conclusion: An agnostic approach to molecular testing together with protein modelling and a functional assay demonstrated pathogenicity of an SLC35D1 variant and increased the protein's biochemical characterization.

Pathogenic changes in a total of only 22 patients had been described underlining the disease rareness. Two large consanguineous families of Omaniorigin presented to the clinic with 7 individuals affected by primordial dwar ï¬sm resembling SOFT syndrome, but of unknown genetic cause and diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Detailed clinical work up to deï¬ne the symptoms and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed in one of the index patients and two rela tives, as well as subsequent Sanger sequencing for further segregation studies. Result: WES yielded the variant POC1A (NM_015426.4): c.64G>T p.(Val22Phe) which showed segregation within the tested individuals and further family members. This variant affects the alternative exon 2, that ispresent only in two of three POC1A transcripts. Never theless, all of the investigated patients had comparable disease histories with severe growth retardation of prenatal onset, characteristic facial features and respiratory dif ï¬cul ties, the latter being most prominent in the index patient; which con ï¬rmed the diagnosis of SOFT syndrome. Conclusion: Theï¬nding i) considerably increases the number of reported SOFT syndrome patients allowing forfurther clinical delineation of this rare disorder, and ii) add a novel POC1A missense variant in exon 2, allowing to re ï¬ne the relevance of the functional domain affected by thischange and expand the genotype phenotype correlation in POC1A related disorders.

The patient is immobilesince his sixth year. He doesn ât have hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory complications, cardiac valve abnormalities and dental abnormalities. No pathological ophthalmology ï¬nd ings, neither hearing loss.

Results: Unexpectedly, enzyme level of N acet ylgalatosamine 6 sulfate sulphatease showed normal result and excluded Morquio syndrome. Subsequently, exome sequencing showed presence of heterozygous pathogenicmissense variant in KIF22 gene (c.443C>T, p. Pro148Leu). Pathogenic variants in KIF22 gene represent an established cause of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxitytype 2 (OMIM:603546). The clinical presentation of KIF22 associated conditions includes skeletal abnormalities, joint laxity, joint dislocations, spinal deformities and short sta ture, which is compatible with the clinical presentation in our patient. Conclusion: Between Morquio syndrome and spondy loepimetaphyseal dysplasia may exist completely over lapping skeletal phenotype, which is con ï¬rmed literature data (ref. Biswas SN et al., 2017). The distinction betweenthese diseases is very important because of available enzyme replacement therapy for Morquio syndrome type A and completely different pattern of inheritance and recur rence risk.

Here we report on the second casewith bi allelic COL9A3 nonsense mutations. The boy was born with club feet and moderate hearing loss to healthy parents. Radiographs revealed ï¬at lumbar vertebrae, coxa retrotorta, and broad femoral metaphyses. At examination at age 2,5 years we saw a triangular face, bilaterally mild epicanthus, a high arched palate, and short ï¬ngers. In addition, myopia was diagnosed recently. Height was 92 cm, weight 15 kg (50. and 75. centile, respectively). Because of the phenotype, the provisional diagnosis ofStickler syndrome was made and molecular analyses revealed compound heterozygosity for COL9A3 mutationsc.268C>T; p.(Arg90*) and c.1739dup; p.(Gly581Trpfs*20). Bi allelic COL9A1 [MIM 120210] and COL9A2 [MIM 120260] mutations are already known to cause autosomal recessive inherited Stickler syndrome [MIM 614134; 614284]. However, as far as we know, only one family with bi allelic occurrence of a COL9A3 nonsense mutationand Stickler syndrome is published until now. As in our patient, in this family the affected individuals showed a comparatively mild phenotype with no vitreoretinal invol vement or cataracts so far and no cleft palate/Pierre Robin sequence. Thus, the ï¬ndings in our case further support the assumption that bi allelic COL9A3 mutations are verylikely suf ï¬cient to cause Stickler syndrome as well. A. Bohring: None. J. Horvath: None. P.

Mutations in LIFR are responsible for the syndrome. Although the majority of patients are lost due to complications in infancy, patients who reach adoles cent period are reported rarely. Here, we present a 9 years old male with SWS with severe skeletal ï¬ndings due to a novel homozygous mutation in LIFR. Materials and Methods: The patient was the third child of healthy, consanguineous parents, born at term with abirth weight of 3600g(50 75th centile). Bowing in lower extremities was remarkable at birth, and progressed gradu ally with age. He was hospitalized many times for respira tory distress, feeding dif ï¬culties, and recurrent fever. Motor developmental milestones were delayed however, mental development was normal. Physical examination revealedfacial dysmorphic features, bending of the extremities, laxity of the metacarpophalangeal joints, scoliosis, promi nent heels, and pes planus. X ray of extremities showedbowing of the limbs, bilateral valgus deformity, and widening of the femoral and tibial metaphysis.1300Results: Next generation sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq(v1.9) platform using the virtual panel for skeletal dysplasia consisting of 130 genes. The novel homozygous variant in LIFR (c.274C>T) was detected. Segregation within the family showed that parents were heterozygous carriers. Conclusions: Although SWS is a rare genetic disease, it should be kept in mind in patients with congenital bowing in extremities.

Its cardinal signs are shortstature, lipodystrophy and atrophic skin, premature cataract and greying of hair; age associated complications may occur in WS such as osteoporosis, chronic skin ulcers ordiabetes mellitus, and patients usually die around 53 years of age from cardiovascular or neoplastic causes. This recessive genetic affection is linked to loss of functionmutations of WRN gene, coding for a helicase involved in multiple DNA pathways. No recent clinical nor molecular description were available for French WS patients. Methods: Data from French laboratories found 36 genetically con ï¬rmed WS cases, whose 34 for which molecular and clinical data were collected. Results: 31 mutations including 14 newly described ones were identi ï¬ed, with some associated with a speci ï¬c French region. The mean age for diagnosis was 40.5 years, thecardinal signs were found in all the patients, and under estimated features (deafness, hepatic, thyroid, valvular, hypertensive or capillary impairments) were commonlydiagnosed. Death occurred at 53.6 years of age, mostly from cancerous etiologies. Despite the homogeneity of the main signs, it seems that phenotypes with less severe evolutionmay exist, without associated predictive or causal factors.

30294,"Universitaires St. Luc, Brussels, Belgium,3Cliniques Universitaires St Luc & Institute of Experimental and Clinical Research, UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium,4Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multi system disease of unknown cause, characterized by vascular and immune dysregulation that results in progressive ï¬brosis of the skin and other organs. While rare, it can be lethal, and there are currently no treatments. SSc is typically sporadic; familial forms are extremely rare. By applying genome wide NextGeneration Sequencing (NGS) to such families, we aim to identify genetic âdrivers â, i.e., disease causative or strongly predisposing alleles. We hypothesize that thesegenes may also contribute to sporadic disease, when they carry strong de novo mutations, weak inherited variants (that cause disease only in combination with other geneticand environmental factors), or somatic mutations in affected tissues. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on blood DNA from two affected ï¬rst degree relatives each from ï¬ve families, and ï¬ltered for genes with missense or nonsense variants that (i) co segregate with disease, (ii) are rare in public sequence databases and an in house WESdatabase, and (iii) predicted to affect protein function in silico . Between 18 and 40 such genes were identi ï¬ed per family. Candidate gene prioritization was performed usingliterature and database mining, as well as intersection with RNASeq data from sporadic SSc cutaneous tissue biopsies. Variants in the two highest ranked candidates (one a pro ï¬brotic growth factor, the other a cytokine receptor with pro ï¬brotic, pro in ï¬ammatory effects) are currently being tested for their effects on protein function. Proof of an effecton protein function will be followed by testing for a role in a bleomycin induced mouse model of SSc. N. Limaye: None. M. Vanthuyne: None. F. Houssiau: None. V. Smith: None. B.

Hypodontia is de ï¬ned by the agenesis of six teeth or less, whereas oligodontia refers to the agenesis of more than six teeth, excluding the third molars. Hypodontia and oligodontia can be associated withdefects in the development of other ectodermal structures such as hairs, sweat glands and nails, de ï¬ning the spectrum of ectodermal dysplasias. Mutations in WNT10A are known as a major cause of oligodontia with or without associated ectodermal dysplasia signs. Patients and Methods: Based on the analysis of a large series of 413 probands with hypo or oligodontia and 190 of their relatives, we report 395 subjects with mutations in the gene WNT10A . Results: We found a mutation in WNT10A in 227 of the 413 probands, among which two recurrent mutations the c.682T>A (p. Phe228Ile) and c.321C>A (p. Cys107Ter) arerespectively involved in 178 and 33 unrelated probands and families. We show a pattern of tooth agenesis in patients with WNT10A mutations and a broad phenotypic variability despite a correlation between the number of mutations, the number of tooth agenesis and the presence of ectodermal signs. We con ï¬rm the incomplete penetrance of WNT10A mutation with an estimate of the penetrance and report several asymptomatic cases with biallelic mutations. Discussion: Despite some degree of genotype phenotype correlation, we highlight the incomplete penetrance and broad clinical variability associated with WNT10A mutations. O. Patat: None. I.

Pathogenic variants in theACTA2 gene are the most frequently encountered genetic cause of familial thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection (FTAAD). Although TAAD is the main clinical manifesta tion, a variety of occlusive vascular disease and extra vascular manifestations occur in ACTA2 related vasculopathy. Current data suggest possible mutation speciï¬c manifestations of vascular and extra aortic traits. Despite its relatively high prevalence, comprehensive recommendations on the care of patients and families withpathogenic variants in ACTA2 have not yet been estab lished.

The Î² blocker celiprolol has been suggested to prevent arterial damage in vEDS, but the underlying mechanism remainsunclear. It is also unknown whether the widely used AGTR1 antagonist losartan has a therapeutic effect invEDS. We evaluated the impact of celiprolol and losartan on the biomechanical integrity of the vEDS thoracic aorta. Methods: We (re )characterised a murine vEDS model at molecular level using WGS and developed an objective approach to measure the maximum tensile force at rupture of uniaxially stretched murine thoracic aortic rings. Toassess treatment effect, heterozygous mice at 4 weeks of age underwent a 4 week treatment with celiprolol, losartan, and, as a proof of concept drug, the MMP inhibitor doxycycline. Results: Heterozygous mice showed a signi ï¬cant reduc tion in the rupture force compared to wild type mice. Compared to age and sex matched untreated heterozygousmice, treatment with doxycycline or celiprolol resulted in a signiï¬cant increase of rupture force, whereas no signi ï¬cant change was detected upon losartan treatment. Conclusions: Our novel read out system is suitable for the assessment of the biomechanical effect of candidate drugs. In a vEDS model, celiprolol or doxycycline, but notlosartan, can improve the biomechanical integrity of the aortic wall. As doxycycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic with considerable side effects, celiprolol may be more sui table for a long term therapy and thus rather indicated for the medication of patients with vEDS. This is the ï¬rst study demonstrating that celiprolol improves the rupture force ofthe thoracic aorta. N. Dubacher: None. J. MÃ¼nger: None. M. C. Gor osabel: None. J. Crabb: None. A. A.

Mutations in genes encoding proteins of cardiac intercalated discs account for about 60% of ACM cases, but the remaining 40% is still geneticallyelusive. Aim: We aim at identifying novel ACM genes by next generation sequencing. Methods and Results: The DNA of 40 ACM patients was analyzed using a targeted gene panel consisting of 15 knownACM genes and 53 candidate genes. We found two novel variants in TP63 (c.796C>T, p .R266*) and PPP1R13L (c.1858G>C, p. A620P) candidate genes, encoding for theproteins p63 and iASPP, respectively. The TP63 variant is scored as likely pathogenic and the PPP1R13L variant as of uncertain signi ï¬cance and involves a conserved functional domain. Importantly, the mutant TP63 allele leads to nonsense mediated mRNA decay, causinghaploinsuf ï¬ciency. Also, novel variants in TJP1 gene were detected by whole exome sequencing in additional 4 ACM Italian and Dutch/German probands. Out of the 4 variants, p. Y669C in the encoded protein ZO 1 promotes structural rearrangements of the GUK domain, whereas the p. R265W, p. S329L, andp. D360V are predicted to impair the function of the involved the disordered region between PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains. Furthermore, rare variants in TJP1 are sig niï¬cantly enriched in patients with ACM relative to controls. Conclusions: We provide the ï¬rst evidence linking TP63 andTJP1 variants to ACM, while the functional involve ment of PPP1R13L remains to be determined.

It is characterized by ectopia lentis, spontaneous ï¬ltering blebs, other anterior segment anomalies and craniofacial dysmorphism. Thirteen patients have beenreported, and aortic dilatation has not been noted, though details regarding aortic measurements have not been consistently provided. We report three paediatric patientsfrom two families affected with Traboulsi syndrome presenting with mild moderate aortic dilatation in addition to the ocular phenotype. The two affected individuals inFamily 1 have dilation of the aortic root (Patient 1 I aortic sinus 30.2 Boston z score 2.2, Patient 1 II aortic sinus 28.2 mm, Boston z score 4.1, and sinotubular junction 23.7 mm,Boston z score 4.7). In addition Patient 1 I has a myxomatous mitral valve with regurgitation, and Patient 1 II has a bicuspid aortic valve. Both patients harbor ahomozygous variant in ASPH (NM_004318.3 c.2204 G>A (ep. Arg735Gln)). The substitution of tryptophan for arginine at this residue has been reported previously inTraboulsi syndrome. The ocular ï¬ndings in Family 1 included both microspherophakia and ectopia lentis.

However, the bacterial DNA of atherosclerotic plaques mainly wasinvestigated by metagenomic approaches. Objective: To search for the protozoa by using genome wide sequencing data of human atherosclerotic plaques (AP). Material and Methods: We used the results of whole genome sequencing of DNA isolated from 12 athero sclerotic plaques (SRA149235) and 2 blood samples from1000 Genomes Project (HG00096, HG00099). Sequence reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19) using Bowtie2. The taxonomic classi ï¬cation of the reads was performed with Kraken2 using a curated microbial genome database containing archaea, bacteria, fungi, pro tozoa, viruses reference genome sequence. Results anddiscussion: Pre alignment on the human genome, even with âvery sensitive âoption of Bowtie2, cannot completely clean up human gene sequences. Kraken2 determined 13%to 92% of the human gene sequences in unmatched reads of different AP samples. We found sequences of Toxoplasma gondii genome in 8 samples (about 1678 reads per sample).These sequences were shown to be mapped to contigs (NW_017384310.1, NW_017384809.1). These contigs were also found in samples from 1000 Genomes Project. Conclusions: There were no protozoa in genome wide sequencing data of human atherosclerotic plaques. The reads that mapped to the Toxoplasma genome are falsepositive. Some microbial reference genomes probably to contain human DNA sequences not presented in the human reference genome assembly. A.

BirkBen Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel Introduction: Three generations of a kindred presented with autosomal dominant early onset paroxysmal atrial ï¬brillation (pAF), with recurrent nocturnal self terminating palpitations. Methods: Whole exome sequencing, linkage analysis, electrophysiological assays in Xenopus oocytes. Results: Through genetic studies we identi ï¬ed a disease causing p. S447R mutation in KCND2 , encoding the pore forming ( Î±) subunit of the Kv4.2 cardiac potassium chan nel. Kv4.2, with Kv4.3, contributes to the cardiac fasttransient outward K +current, I to. Itounderlies the early repolarization phase in the cardiac action potential, setting the initial potential of the plateau phase and governing itsduration and amplitude. In Xenopus oocytes, the p. S447R mutation increased inactivation time constant of the channel and affected its regulation: the mutation resides in a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site, which normally attenuates Kv4.2 membrane expression. Mutant Kv4.2 exhibited impaired response to PKC, resulting in augmentedKv4.2 membrane expression and enhanced potassium cur rents. Moreover, in a hybrid channel composed of Kv4.3 and Kv4.2, simulating the mature endogenous hetero tetrameric channel underlying I to, the Kv4.2 mutation exerted gain of function effect on Kv4.3. Thus, the muta tion exerts gain of function effect on both Kv4.2 homo tetramers and Kv4.2 Kv4.3 hetero tetramers. Conclusions: Gain of function mutation in Kv4.2 causes nocturnal pAF. Interestingly, Kv4.2 expression was pre viously shown to demonstrate circadian variation, with peak expression at daytime in murine hearts (human nighttime), with possible relevance to the nocturnal onset of parox ysmal AF symptoms in our patients. The atrial speci ï¬c phenotype suggests that targeting Kv4.2 might be effective in the treatment of nocturnal paroxysmal AF, avoidingadverse ventricular effects. M. Drabkin: None. N.

It is a dominant condition caused by heterozygous variants in ABCC9 orKCNJ8 . Here, we report a baby boy patient who was referred to Cantusyndrome without skeletal manifestations. Methods: Blood samples and clinical data were collected after informed consent. Trio whole exome sequencing wasperformed in this patient and his parents. Public population SNP databases (dbSNP147, gnomAD, ExAC and 1000 Genomes project) and in silico predictive algorithms were used to identify the pathogenic variants. Results: We detected a novel de novo heterozygous missense, likely pathogenic variant (c.3203T>C) in ABCC9 gene. This mutation was located in transmembrane cyto plasmic domain 2 (TMD2) which may be gain of function and increase K ATPchannel activity. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst report of a Chinese baby patient with pathogenic mutation in ABCC9 . Our descrip tion of the patient âs phenotype would be a part of a spectrum of features associated with Cantu syndrome. The unreported mutation extends the genetic spectra of ABCC9 and emphasizes the usefulness of WES for genetic diag nosis in clinical context.

Around 25% of the patients do not seem to carry germline mutation in eitherone of these two genes. While some of those 25% of patients may have mutations in as yet unidenti ï¬ed genes, mutations in RASA1 orEPHB4 that escape detection by less sensitive techniques, such as post zygotic mosaic mutations, are also possible explanations. Methods: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes, saliva or vascular malformation tissues from 4 patients. RASA1 and EPHB4 coding regions and exon/ intron boundaries were analysed by targeted custom genepanel sequencing. A second panel and/or Sanger sequen cing were used to con ï¬rm the mutations identi ï¬ed. Results: Four distinct mosaic RASA1 mutations, with an allele frequency ranging from 3% to 25%, were identi ï¬ed in the 4 index patients with classical capillary malformation arteriovenous malformation phenotype. Three mutationswere known, one was novel. In one patient, a somatic second hit was also identi ï¬ed. One index case had three affected children, illustrating germline mosaicism. Conclusion: This study shows that RASA1 mosaic mutations can cause capillary malformation arteriovenous malformation. Thus, highly sensitive sequencing techniquesshould be considered as diagnostic tools, especially for patients with no family history. Even low level mosaicism can cause the classical phenotype and increased risk foroffspring. In addition, our study further supports the second hit pathophysiological mechanism to explain the multifocality of vascular lesions in this disorder. N. Revencu: None. E. Fastre: None. M.

Cardio genetics is emerging as a main discipline for deciphering multiple cardiac patholo gies, with immediate clinical effects on diagnosis, treat ment, prevention and prognosis for patients and their family members. Methods: We have established the ï¬rst designated cardio genetics clinic in Israel as part of a tertiary hospital two years ago. We retrospectively reviewed all our patient'sï¬les from the last 2 years. Results: Three hundred patients from 200 families visited our clinic and they represent variant population from allover Israel both from Jewish and non Jewish origins. The patients were referred from both pediatric and adults car diologists, cardiovascular surgeons and primary carephysicians. Most visits (90%) in our clinic were as outpatients and only 10% were acutely hospitalized. The patients were referred due to: congenital heart dis eases in 10%, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 52%, dilated cardiomyopathy in 14%, arrhythmogenic right ventricledysplasia in 8%, left ventricular non compaction in 4%, channelopathies in 10% and 2% due to aborted sudden death. The patients underwent a genetic investigation in different methods according to the clinical presentation: Sanger sequencing for known familial/founder mutation, singlegene sequencing, NGS based gene panel sequencing, Whole Exome Sequencing and chromosomal microarray. We have identi ï¬ed the underlying genetic cause in approximately 40% of the families the percentage varies between the different cardiac pathologies.

30304,"M. Carballo Hospital de Terrassa (CST), Terrassa, SpainIntroduction: Inherited cardiomyopathies (CMs) are a major cause of heart disease. They can be classi ï¬ed in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyo pathy (DCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyo pathy (ARVC), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) and leftventricular non compaction (LVNC). Due to their clinical and genetic heterogeneity, targeted gene Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) can be a helpful tool in their diagnosisand to early detect them in pre symptomatic carriers. Materials and Methods: 39 DNA samples of patients affected with different CMs were analyzed by targeted NGSusing Cardio GeneSGKit Â®(n,238 genes) or Cardio Gen eSGKit Â®MCP (n ,90 genes). Results were ï¬ltered and analyzed with GeneSystems Â®platform and informed to patients. Co segregation analysis and/or carrier testing were performed when possible. Results: 7 pathogenic/probably pathogenic variants were detected in 5 HCM patients and 2 DCM patients. In HCM patients, mutations were found in MYBPC3 (p. Arg495Gln, p. Gly532Alafs*23 and p. Arg597Gln), CAV3 (p. Thr78Met), TNNC1 (p. Ala8Val) and TNNI3 (p. Arg145Gln). In DCM patients, mutations were detected in DSP (p. Leu1773 Tyrfs*8) and TTN (p. Pro28946Leufs*6). Also, 17 variants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VOUS) were detected in 14 patients affected with HCM (n ,10), DCM (n ,3) and ARVC (n ,1). These VOUS were mainly detected in MYBPC3 (n,7) but also in other genes as DSC2 (n,1), FHL1 (n,1),FLNC (n,1),LDB3 (n,1),LMNA (n,1), MYH7 (n,2), PKP4 (n,1), SCN5A (n,1) and TNNT2 (n,2). Conclusions: 19 of the 39 analyzed patients (48.7%) presented a clinically signi ï¬cant variant in one or two genes associated with CMs. Detection of pathogenic/probably pathogenic variants in probands can help to improve the diagnostic, prognostic and treatment in them and in pre symptomatic carriers.

Kmoch1 1RURD, Prague 2, Czech Republic,2Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM), Department of Cardiology, Prague, Czech RepublicCardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle associated with a disorder of its function. This is a heterogeneous group of diseases with various clinical signs that can ultimately lead to heart failure. A signi ï¬cant proportion of cardiomyopathies is genetically determined. In this group can be found congenital heart defects, muscular dystrophyand congenital myopathy, hereditary disorders of metabo lism and genetic syndromes, (rasopathies). The use of the whole exome sequencing is currently one of the mosteffective tools for elucidating the genotype of individual patients. We have successfully used this method for studying of genetic architecture of dilated cardiomyopathycohort where in about 80% of the 460 examined patients we have found probably causal variant. Most frequently affected genes were TTN (18%) , FLNC (4%) , MYBPC3 (4%) , MYH7 (4%), DSP (4%) , RBM20 (3%) , TNNT2 (3%), DES (2%) ,L M N A (1%). We have also found CNV variations in DMD ,LAMP2 ,FLNC, LMNA and MYH7 genes, which were predicted to cause major structural and functional abnormalities of the affected genes. We are also focusing on paediatric forms of cardiomyopathy which aremore complex and the clari ï¬cation is below 50%. Successful molecular biology diagnostic helps to identify the risk of occurrence of the disease in the family and toprovide prenatal diagnosis. In selected cases, the phenotype can also be studied in cell models, which contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the diseaseand allow a more accurate interpretation of extreme clinical or laboratory ï¬ndings.

30307,"Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States Background: In striated muscle, alpha actinin 2 is a critical cytoskeletal protein that anchors actin ï¬laments within the sarcomere. Rare mutations in ACTN2 have been associated with cardiac abnormalities, including arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms behind how dysfunctional ACTN2 causes cardiac malfunction is notknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of two novel ACTN2 variants on human cardiac tissue and patient speci ï¬c iPSC derived cardiomyocytes. Methods and Results: We identi ï¬ed patients in the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease data base with novel ACTN2 variants using a custom mutation pipeline optimized for rare variant discovery. We identi ï¬ed one patient homozygous for a stop gain mutation (p. Q860X) in ACTN2 and a family with an exon 8 10 deletion. In heart transplant tissue of the homozygous patient, we observed mild hypertrophy and interstitial ï¬brosis. There was no evidence of variation in ACTN2 protein expression,indicating absence of nonsense mediated decay. We used siRNA to knock down ACTN2 in neonatal rat ventricularcardiomyocytes and a human myoblast cell line and observed dramatic changes in cell size and morphology. Patient derived iPSC cardiomyocytes were hypertrophic, displayed sarcomeric structural disarray and had slower contractile velocity compared to control iPSC cardiomyocytes. Using Co Immunoprecipitation forACTN2, followed by mass spectrometry, we identi ï¬ed missing protein protein interactions in the patient with the truncated ACTN2. Conclusions: Here, we provide evidence that two struc tural genetic variants in ACTN2 are associated to contractile dysfunction and lead to cardiac abnormalities, includinghypertrophy and arrhythmia.

P. van Tintelen UMC Utrecht, The Netherlands, Utrecht, Netherlands Introduction: There is an ongoing debate on the genes that should be examined during genetic evaluation of idiopathic cardiomyopathy patients. Although several genes havesufï¬cient evidence to be cardiomyopathy related, for other genes this remains unclear. These genes may however cause a signi ï¬cant burden on variant evaluation. In order to make an evidence based estimation of the value of genes examined, we assessed results of cardiomyopathy gene panels after reevaluation and reclassi ï¬cation of variants according to current criteria. Materials and Methods: All results of a 64 gene NGS cardiomyopathy panel performed between 2014 and 2018 inthe UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands were retrieved. The pathogenicity of all gene variants was reevaluated according to current criteria by an experienced clinical laboratoryspecialist in cardiogenetics. Benign or likely benign variants were excluded from analysis. Summary results were deter mined for all individual genes. Results: 1264 cardiomyopathy panels performed showed 848 variants (657 unique) in 638 patients (overall yield 50.5%). Of the 848 variants, 124 variants were reclassi ï¬ed (15%), of which 117 were downgraded (94%). Reclassi ï¬ cation was mostly due to a high frequency in control1310populations or based on in house clinical data (e.g. non segregation). 28 genes were determined to be of limited value in regular pan cardiomyopathy gene panel testing because of the absence of relevant variants, published lit erature (including ClinGen gene adjudication). Conclusions: Cardiomyopathy NGS gene panels per formed on 1264 patients, identi ï¬ed 28 genes of limited value in regular genetic testing for cardiomyopathy. In addition, state of art reevaluation of variants resulted in anotable downgrading of previously identi ï¬ed variants. D. Dooijes: None. M. A. Siemelink: None. J. J. van der Smagt: None. R.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is well known risk factors for cardiovas cular diseases and myocardial infarction. Several physiolo gical factors can stimulate the emergence of T2DM and myocardial infarction, and some of these factors are knownto oscillate with circadian rhythms. This study aimed to explore a possible association of the genetic variability in the circadian clock genes ARNTL ,CLOCK , and PER2 with myocardial infarction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an additional risk factor for myocardial infarction. The study group consisted of 231 patients withmyocardial infarction and T2DM and a control group of 426 T2DM patients. Altogether, 8 SNPs were tested, three in ARNTL gene (rs3789327, rs4757144 and rs12363415), three in CLOCK (rs11932595, rs6811520 and rs13124436), and two in PER2 (rs35333999 and rs934945). The signiï¬cance of association for individual SNP was calcu lated to compare the allelic frequency and genotype distribution in patients and control participants using the Chi Square test. After using Bonferroni correction signi ï¬ cant difference in the distribution of ARNTL rs12363415 polymorphism genotypes were found in patients withmyocardial infarction and T2DM in comparison to controls, with a p value of 1.42x10 4and odds ratio equal to 7.37 (95% CI: 4.15 to 13.08). Other SNPs in ARNTL ,CLOCK , andPER2 genes were not signi ï¬cant additional risk factors for myocardial infarction in T2DM patients.

Genetic testing may be used to con ï¬rm a diagnosis in unclear cases and therefore, is increasingly being performed in a heterogeneous patient population. This is a retro spective review of 134 patients with clinical suspicion of CPVT referred for genetic testing at Blueprint Genetics over a 5 year period (2013 2018). Genetic test results werecompiled. A sub analysis of diagnostic RYR2 variants (location, segregation) was performed. A pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variant was identi ï¬ed in 27 patients (20.1%). Twenty patients (14.9%) had a diagnostic ï¬nding in a CPVT associated gene: 62.9% in RYR2 , 7.4 % inCALM1 , and 3.7% in CASQ2 (biallelic). Four patients (14.8%) had a P or LP variant in KCNQ1 ,KCNJ2 or SCN5A and three (11.1%) had a P or LP variant in a cardiomyopathy associated gene ( DSG2, DSP orPLN). All P/LP RYR2 variants were missense, except a deletion encompassing exon 3. Parental testing was performed in 11/ 17 cases where P/LP RYR2 variants were found; 8 (72.7%) variants were de novo . Enrichment of P/LP RYR2 variants in the four described hotspots (OR 50, 95% CI 29 85, P<0.0001) was observed. In conclusion, 37% of patientswith a diagnostic test result had a clinically signi ï¬cant variant in a gene other than RYR2 .

30311,"States Complex lymphatic anomalies include a variety of diag noses: lymphangiectasia, central conducting lymphatic anomaly (CCLA), generalized lymphatic anomaly, kaposi form lymphangiomatosis, and Gorham Stout disease. Theoverlapping of diagnostic criteria for these disorders suggests that a common pathway rather than a commongene is responsible for the various clinical syndromes. Upon sequencing 45 such patients, we identi ï¬ed seven pathogenic variants in ï¬ve genes encoding components of RAS/MAPK signaling ( BRAF ,KRAS ,SOS1 ,RASA1 , and PTPN11 )i n seven unrelated patients. Additionally, we identi ï¬ed a recurrent somatic missense mutation in a candidate gene,ARAF (c.640T>C:p. S214P), as the basis for CCLA in two unrelated patients. ARAF encodes for serine/threonine protein kinase A Raf. Little is known about ARAF apartfrom the enzyme being involved in MAPK pathway with no previous involvement in lymphatic disease report. Primary endothelial cell studies showed the mutation altered actinskeleton and VE cadherin organization, which were fully reversed by inhibition of MEK signaling. Functional relevance of the mutation was also validated by recreatinga lymphatic phenotype in a zebra ï¬sh model, with rescue of the anomalous phenotype using a MEK inhibitor. Sub sequent therapy of the lead proband with a MEK inhibitorled to dramatic clinical improvement, with remodeling of the patient âs lymphatic system with resolution of the lymphatic edema, marked improvement in his pulmonaryfunction tests, cessation of supplemental oxygen require ments, and near normalization of daily activities. Taken together, our work demonstrates the realization of precisionmedicine approach enabled through a novel genetic discovery in a patient with lymphatic anomaly of a previously unknown etiology. D.

The etiology of CHD largely unknown, genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease. Recurrent1312copy number variants (CNVs) have been reported in the pathogenesis of CHD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ï¬cation (MLPA) and microarray analyses on isolated and syndromic CHD cases and to explore the relationship between identi ï¬ed CNVs and CHD. Materials and Methods: Cytoscan 750K array (Affy metrix) and MLPA SALSA P250 and P311 kits (MRC Holland) were used in the study. The identi ï¬ed CNVs were conï¬rmed by ï¬uorescence in situ hybridization. Results. Eighteen prenatal samples, 16 isolated and 33 syndromic patients with mild to severe CHD phenotype were studied. Prenatal and isolated CHD cases did not show pathogenic CNVs. Clinically signi ï¬cant CNVs were detected in 7/33 (21%) syndromic CHD patients: del 22q11.2 (n ,2), 8p23.1 duplication (n ,2), deletion 5p (n ,1), deletion 6q21 q22 (n,1), unbalanced translocation causing partial deletion of 4q34.3 and duplication of 6q25.1 (n ,1). Conclusion: The identi ï¬ed genomic imbalances contain genes that has been associated with human CHD before.

Human adipokinome consists of hundreds of molecules many ofwhich have not yet been well characterized and have variable expression in different adipose depots. Materials and Methods: We compared DPP4 ,LCN2 , NAMPT ,ITLN1 ,APLN and ADIPOQ mRNA levels in adipocytes isolated from the biopsies of subcutaneous (SCAT), epicardial (EAT) and perivascular (PVAT) adiposetissue obtained from 25 patients with coronary artery disease. Gene expression signature was determined by RT qPCR with hydrolysis probes. Results: We found that DPP4 and APLN mRNA expression was signi ï¬cantly ( P<0.05) increased only in adipocytes isolated from epicardial adipose tissue compared to the subcutaneous fat. The ITLN1 gene was overexpressed in epicardial adipose tissue compared to both subcutaneous and perivascular tissues and expression of ADIPOQ gene was reduced both in EAT and PVAT compared to SCAT. Moreover, APLN mRNA expression was positively corre lated with total and LDL cholesterol plasma level, and DPP4 mRNA expression with VLDL cholesterol con centration. We found no signi ï¬cant changes in LCN2 and NAMPT mRNA level between studied adipose depots. Conclusions: Adipocytes isolated from different adipose depots are characterized by differential gene expression of adipokines. EAT is of particular interest in the context of its function, molecular and genetic mechanisms of regulationof the cardiovascular system and as a therapeutic target for correction of adipose tissue induced effects on health.

Approximately 75% of AC patients show bi ventricularinvolvement and left dominant forms are not uncommon. Loss of function mutations in Desmoplakin ( DSP) cause a form of AC often manifesting with severe arrhythmias andsudden cardiac death (SCD). Less is known about DSPmutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) regarding (endo)phenotype, penetrance, and management. Materials and Methods: A family with DCM and SCD was referred to our cardiogenetics outpatient clinic. Accu rate genetic and cardiologic assessments were performed. DNA sequencing was initiated in the proband using NGS(cardiopanel). Results: A novel variant in DSP c.4639dupC was iden tiï¬ed, absent in gnomAD, locus speci ï¬c databases and predicted as deleterious by dedicated software, affecting cardiac speci ï¬c isoform and leading to frameshift p. (Gln1547ProfsTer80). The 60 year old proband and herthree nieces (aged 32 45) were diagnosed with DCM and ICD implanted. Five siblings (aged 25 61) had SCD. Seg regation analysis in asymptomatic relatives identi ï¬ed two mutated siblings (31 and 47 years): one presented an epi sode of acute myocarditis. Despite detailed cardiologic evaluation, they did not meet current diagnostic guidelinesfor AC/DCM. Conclusions: Loss of function DSP mutations cause different phenotypes including AC and DCM. A diagnosticgrey zone between left dominant AC and arrhythmogenic DCM exists, indicating the need for updating current clas siï¬cation.

The more complex forms of rare CVD tend to result from the integrated effect of multiple genetic variants that create a background of susceptibility requiring sometimes additional factors for the disease to manifest. Whole exome, wholegenome and target sequencing offer new possibilities to discover the complex etiology of such diseases. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants associated withthe rare CVD using next generation sequencing (NGS). Materials and Methods: NGS with TruSight panels (Illumina) was used to analyze DNA samples from 24patients with rare CVD: Long QT Syndrome, Tetralogy of Fallot, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, suspected Marfan Syndrome, Pathology of great vessels, Cardiomyopathiesand other. Results: In 14 (58%) of the 24 patients, at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found. Ofthose, in 8 patients we detected only one variant, in 3 patients there was a combination of two or more only pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, and in 3 patients thecombination was of pathogenic/likely pathogenic and VUS. Of the remaining 10 patients, in 5 (21%) patients, only VUS were detected (3 with two VUS and 2 with one VUS) and in5 (21%) patients, we did not detect signi ï¬cant mutations. Overall, in 9 (47%) of the patients with detected variants, more than one variant was found indicating multiple het erozygosity.

Two SNPs ( LPL rs328 and APOE rs157580) were selected as the instrumental variables.

Results: We found rs328 was signi ï¬cantly associated with decreased triglyceride levels ( Î², 9.105, p ,0.012) and increased HDL C levels ( Î²,1.317, p ,0.037), but not with LDL C levels. The rs157580 was marginally associated with increased LDL C levels. We further found a sig niï¬cantly protective effect of LDL C levels on cardiovas cular disease (OR ,0.987, 95% CI ,0.980 0.994), but not with triglycerides, HDL C and CVD. The IV analysis revealed an increasing risk of LDL C levels on cardiovas cular disease by using rs157580 and allele score as the IVs (rs157580: OR ,1.028, 95% CI ,1.018 1.038; allele score: OR,1.028, 95% CI ,1.019 1.038). Triglyceride and HDL C were also associated with cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: We identi ï¬ed the causal relationships between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease by usingAPOE rs157580 and allele score as the instrumental vari ables.

Additional transitional phenotypes have been described, including patients with prevalentlycardiac and limb involvement, presenting with atrioven tricular canal defect with common atrium (AVCD CA) and postaxial polydactyly. We report on the results ofmolecular analysis of a family with vertical transmission in father and daughter of AVCD CA and postaxial polydactyly. The father was compound heterozygous forthe known recessive p. Arg622* nonsense variant and the novel p. Arg663Pro missense change in the EVC gene. His affected daughter was compound heterozygous for thesame nonsense variant and the novel splice site c.1316 7A>G variant. Two additional unaffected sisters were also examined. One was heterozygous carrier of the p. Arg622*variant, while the other was compound heterozygous for both the p. Arg663Pro change and the c.1316 7A>G variant. mRNA sequencing in the affected daughter âs ï¬broblast showed that c.1316 7A>G resulted in the in frame insertion of 6 nucleotides between EVC exon 9 and 10, and that the expression of the p. Arg622* correspond ing allele was greatly decreased. Consistently, western blot analysis showed a residual amount of EVC protein in the father's and daughter's ï¬broblasts. Present results suggest that p. Arg663Pro and c.1316 7A>G are hypo morphic EVC alleles that act as genetic modi ï¬ers together with a loss of function mutation to cause a milder clinicalsubtype of EvCS characterized by AVCD CA and postaxial polydactyly.

30319,"ethanolamine (NAEA), and ceramide (CER) classes are potential novel biomarkers of coronary artery disease andtype 2 diabetes. Major gene effects have been discovered for certain lipid species, notably lipoprotein(a). We sought to establish the heritability of EC, NAEA, and CER species,and identify DNA variants in ï¬uencing their concentrations in plasma. Materials and Methods: We undertook heritability (QTDT, GCTA) and GWAS analyses (FaST LMM) of 11 ECs and NAEAs, and 37 CERs in 1,016 plasma samples from 196 British Caucasian families ascertained through ahypertensive proband, using targeted mass spectrometry and Illumina 660W Quad genotyping. Results: NAEAs are more heritable than well studied EC anandamide (AEA) (h 2AEA,32 35%; P<5.80x10 11). 24 46% of the variation in potential biomarker CER is due to genetic factors (P<1.00x10 7). GWAS identi ï¬ed associa tions with eQTLs of proteins in their metabolism (e.g. FAAH; P NAEA DHEA <6.33x10 12, SPTLC3; P CERN(24)S (18) <8.99x10 19) and novel loci implicated in cancer risk and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (e.g. FBXO28; P CERN (24)S(19)ratio <1.95x10 8, SULT1C4; P CERN(24)S(19) <8.99x10 19). Two sample Mendelian randomisation sug gests that a variant in FAAH (rs324420) in ï¬uencing the level of plasma NAEAs (beta NAEA DHEA ,0.39; P<6.33x10 12) is causally associated with both obesity and drug addiction. Conclusions: We demonstrate for the ï¬rst time estimates of heritability for this extended array of bioactive lipids,identify GWAS signi ï¬cant SNPs associating with their levels in circulation, and implicate the lipid species studied here in cardiovascular disease, cancer, and drug addition.

Initially driven by the neuroscience ï¬eld, the development of GEVIs has now found applications in thecardiovascular sciences as well. Thanks to these GEVIs, it has become possible to image cardiac voltage dynamics at the cellular level in vivo in translucent organisms such as zebra ï¬sh. Unfortunately, up to now, the ï¬uorescent signal of the cardiac voltage sensors used in zebra ï¬sh has been very dim. For this reason, we developed a new stabletransgenic zebra ï¬sh model, expressing Ace2N mNeon, a next generation voltage sensor with brighter ï¬uorescence, under the control of the myocardial speci ï¬c promoter myl7 . Using Selective Plane lllumination Microscopy (SPIM), the conduction of individual action potentials in the heart of 3 dpf zebra ï¬sh larvae can be visualized in vivo , allowing the measurements of action potential duration and conduction speed.

Alastalo Blueprint Genetics, Helsinki, FinlandIntroduction: Genetic testing in Hypertrophic Cardiomyo pathy (HCM) is recommended by published guidelines. Genetic testing by NGS panels offers practical differential diagnostic solution. Objective: Diagnostic yield in a heterogeneous cohort of patients with a suspicion of HCM Methods: A retrospective review of patients with a sus pected clinical diagnosis of HCM referred for genetic test ing at Blueprint Genetics between 2013 and 2018 was undertaken. Variants classi ï¬ed as pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) at the time of reporting were considered diagnostic. Results: Diagnostic yield was 26.2% (361/1,376). In total, 373 P/LP variants were identi ï¬ed including 363 var iants diagnostic for HCM whereas only 10 were diagnostic for another type of cardiomyopathy based on clinical andgenetic interpretation ( DES, DSP, LMNA, TTN ). Approxi mately 86% (n ,320) of diagnostic variants (23.3% of all tests) involved genes encoding the sarcomere. Seventeen Por LP variants (4.6% of variants and 1.2% of all tests) were in RASopathy genes and thirteen P or LP variants (3.5% of 0.9% of all tests) were in metabolic/in ï¬ltrative disease genes. In addition, three patients with non diagnostic ï¬nd ings for cardiomyopathy had P or LP variants in genes linked to a channelopathy (RYR2, SCN5A) or neuro ï¬ bromatosis ( NF1). Conclusions: The diagnostic yield of genetic testing in a heterogeneous cohort of patients with a suspected diagnosisof HCM analyzed is lower than what has been reported in well characterized patient cohorts. Importantly, 8% of all diagnostic ï¬ndings were in metabolic and RASopathy genes which have signi ï¬cant systemic medical management implications. J. Koskenvuo: None. J. Hathaway: None. I.

Predictive genetic testing is offered to asymptomatic relatives to allow targeted medical care with early therapeutics in order to reduce the risk ofcomplications. The aim of this study was to evaluate thepsychological and socio professional impact of predictive genetic testing in hereditary heart diseases. Patients and Methods: This multicentric French study involved 20 expert centers in hereditary heart diseases. We included 517 adult relatives (42.3Â±16.7 years, 60.6% females) who performed predictive genetic testing (pro spective study: N ,264, retrospective study: N ,253). The opinion and experience were collected via auto ques tionnaires, at various moments in the prospective study,with different items and validated scales (STAI and IES). Results: In the prospective study, the main motivations for performing the test were: âto remove doubt â(65.3%), âfor children â(64.0%), âto bene ï¬t from medical super vision â(34.9%). A mutation was present in 39.4% of relatives. No regret was expressed after testing (only 2.3%regrets). The result did not lead to a socio professional change or family relationship change in 60.7%. Among those who had a change, it was perceived as unfavorable foronly 3%. The level of anxiety (STAI scale) increases before the test result and decreased to return to baseline. Subjects with depression history were more likely to develop anxietyat long term (p ,0.004). Conclusions: Our results show no or marginal adverse psychological and socio professional impact of genetictesting when performed by a team expert in predictive testing. C. Bordet: None. S.

The prevalence of FH is approximately 1/250. There is an obvious need for improving early detection and treatment ofFH, which is currently an underdiagnosed condition. We aimed to characterize the disease causing mutation spectrum in Sweden, and to develop a cost effective diag nostics. This was done through iterative improvement of the analytical strategy, consisting of (i) targeted mutation ana lysis using a panel based on Agena mass spectrometry based genotyping; (ii) sequencing of samples failing to show mutations; and (iii) redesign of the panel to include new, recurrently found mutations. To date, we have included 1,143 patients from 14 hos pitals across Sweden in a nationwide collaboration using a panel of 113 pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in theLDLR ,PCSK9 andAPOB genes. Dutch Lipid Clinical Network (DLCN) score was avail able for 482 patients in whom mutations were detected in27%. If restricted to patients with probable or de ï¬nite FH (score â¥6; n,309) pathogenic mutations were detected in 35%. The two most prevalent mutations wereNM_000384.2(APOB):c.10580G>A(p. Arg3527Gln) and NM_000527.4(LDLR):c.259T>G(p. Trp87Gly). In total, 38 different mutations were detected by the panel. 142 panelnegative samples were sequenced with the SEQPPRO LIPO method, yielding 15 additional mutations in 16 patients. In conclusion, our FH panel detected mutations in approximately one fourth of Swedish patients with sus pected FH.

Loss of function mutations in TNNI3K can lead to dilatedcardiomyopathy (MIM616117). No TNNI3K mutations have been found to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in (HCM: MIM192600). We performed a 178 gene panel enriched and next generation sequencing in 8 Thai families with HCM. 8 pathogenic (P)/likely pathogenic (LP) variants were found in 7 families ( MHY7(4) ,TPM1(2),TNNI2(1), TTR(1)). One family harbored two variants in MYH7 and TPM1 . The remaining family without identi ï¬ed P/LP variants was sent for whole exome sequencing. Weidenti ï¬ed a rare spliced TNNI3K (c.1178 2A>G) variant in the 41 year old male with severe eccentric HCM who presented with syncope from ventricular arrhythmia. Hisasymptomatic 60 year old father with apical HCM also harbored this variant. The variant was observed once in the ExAC database and once in our in house Thai exome database (>2,000 cases). RNA analysis revealed an altered splicing mRNA predicted to create a protein with only N terminal Ankyrin repeats without the kinase and the C terminal serine rich domain. Since the C terminal serine rich domain is an inhibitory domain, the identi ï¬ed mutation may represent a gain of function variant by diminishinginhibitory signal of the kinase domain. A previous study expressing wild type human TNNI3K in transgenic mice found that the mice had cardiac hypertrophy. TNNI3Kinhibitor which has undergone preclinical testing can serve as a potential therapy for patients with HCM. In summary, we report a family with a probably gain of functionmutation in TNNI3K , suggesting that TNNI3K is a new disease gene for HCM. P. Phowthongkum: None. S. Tongkobpetch: None. K.

MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs which regulate gene expression and the last fewAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1319years appear as a key tool for understanding the pathophysiology of IHD. Here, we postulate that circulating serum derived miRNA may serve as potential biomarkers for early IHD diagnosis and help to identify diabetic individuals with a predisposition to develop ischemic heart disease. Materials and Methods: We obtained serum samples from 39 T2DM patients (22 with IHD and 17 free of complications). The levels of 798 miRNAs were analysedusing NanoString nCounter Technology Platform. The miRNA regulatory network analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Results: Our data showed that 28 miRNAs (including miR 615 3p, miR 1303, miRR 122 5p, miR 217) were signiï¬cantly upregulated and 1 miRNA (miR 451a) was downregulated in T2DM IHD patients compared to T2DM patients without IHD (adj p < 0.05). Based on the above all miRNAs were classi ï¬ed into four interactive signalling networks. Targeted genes by the identi ï¬ed miRNAs were enriched in pathways associated with metabolic and cardi ovascular diseases, cardiac dysfunction and cardiovascularsystem development. Conclusions: Taken together, our ï¬ndings suggest that circulating miRNAs might have a crucial role in thedevelopment of IHD in diabetic patients and may be used as a potential for early diagnosis.

Thismay be due to the multifactorial nature of this group of diseases, the heterogeneity of pathogenic mechanisms, and the ethnicity of patients. The work was aimed to investigatethe association of genetic polymorphisms with patient âs characteristics in well de ï¬ned clinical groups. Patients and Methods: The study included 81 patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (without a history of stroke) and 69 patients with ischemic stroke (IS). Genotyping was performed using microarray to determine 21 SNPs in the ÐÐ¡Ð , SERPINE1, FGB, F5, F7, F12, GP1BA, GPIIIa, MTHFR, CYP11B2, PON1, PON2, NOS2, NOS3, PDE4D,HIFla, LTA, ALOX5AP genes. Stroke subtypes were deï¬ned according to TOAST criteria. Results: In patients with chronic cerebral ischemia, the TT genotype of the PDE4D (rs966221, SNP83C>T) was associated with rapidly progressive arterial hypertension (OR,6.22; 95%CI ,1.9 20.8; p ,0.0036). In patients with IS the D allele of the ACE gene (rs1799752, I>D) and the DD genotype were associated with cardioembolic subtype of stroke (OR ,2.67, 95%CI ,1.23 5.8, p ,0.02 and OR,7.14, 95%CI ,1.7 29.7, p ,0.0057). In patients with IS the C allele of the GP1BA gene (rs2243093, 5T>C) and TC genotype were associated with large artery athero sclerosis subtype of stroke (brachiocephalic artery stenosis >75% and large artery occlusion) (OR ,3.39, 95%CI ,1.1 10.2, p,0.03 and OR ,4.44, 95% CI ,1.3 15.5, p ,0.023).

We evaluated whether common APOE alleles associate with ischemic stroke outcome, severity andage at onset, within the large multicenter Genetics of Ischaemic Stroke Functional Outcome (GISCOME) study.1320Methods: This study comprises 6,165 ischemic stroke cases with genotype data from SNP arrays. Baseline stroke severity was scored according to the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Functional outcome at 3 months was scored according to the modi ï¬ed Rankin Scale (mRS). We derived common APOE allele status ( Îµ2,Îµ3,Îµ4) by combining information from SNPs rs7412 and rs429358. Effects of minor allele count ( Îµ4,Îµ2) on age at stroke, stroke severity and outcome were estimated separately in comparison to themost common Îµ3/Îµ3 genotype. Results: We found no evidence of a direct effect of Îµ4o n outcome. There was, however, an inverse associationbetween Îµ4 allele count and age at stroke ( Î² 1.8, P,0.00017). This association was signi ï¬cant in both sexes. The Îµ2 allele was independently associated with poor functional outcome (mRS>2) in men (odds ratio[OR]1.47, P,0.008), but not in women (OR 0.87, P,0.44). Conclusion: This is the largest meta analysis on APOE genotype and ischemic stroke outcome to our knowledge. We found a lower age at stroke onset in Îµ4 carriers and a worse functional outcome in male Îµ2 carriers. Even larger studies are warranted to further investigate the effects of APOE alleles on ischemic stroke outcome in different age and sex strata.

Most LDL is cleared from the circulation throughthe hepatic LDL receptor (1). Reduction in activity or number of LDLR gives rise to Familial hypercholester olemia (FH; MIM#143890). Early detection of patients withFH allows initiation of treatment, thus reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. In this study we performed in vitro characterization of new LDLR variants found in FH patients. Materials and Methods: DNA samples from FH patients were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) usinga customized panel of 198 genes. The LDLR missense variants were generate into the expression vector LDLR _NM_000527 Human cDNA GFPSpark Â® tag by site directed mutagenesis and transfected in LDLR de ï¬cient cell line CHO ldlA7 (2,3). Activity and expression of cell surface LDLR were measured by ï¬ow cytometry. LDLR expression was detected by Western Blot and immuno ï¬uorescence. In order to characterize the LDLR intronic variant, the RNA extracted from patientÂ´s peripheral blood mononuclear cellswas analyzed by RT PCR followed by Long Range PCR. All transcripts were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: Seven new variants at LDLR were character ized. The missense variants c.776A>G;p.(Tyr259Cys), c.851G>A;p.(Cys284Tyr), c.1072T>G;p.(Cys358Gly) showed signi ï¬cant differences in activity and expression of LDLR regarding to the w ildtype(WT). The variants c.2279C>T;p.(Thr760Ile) a nd c.2579C>A;p.(Ala860Glu) did not showed any differences. The intronic variantc.2389+4A>G revealed impact on splicing of LDLR resulting as pathogenic. Conclusions: The functional in vitro characterization of rare variants at the LDLR allow us to con ï¬rm the genetic diagnosis of FH, avoiding the classi ï¬cation as âuncertain signiï¬cant variants â, and therefore, to allow for cascade family screening.

30329,"Emirates Introduction: Misfolded proteins in the early secretory pathway are mainly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome systems known as ER associated degradation (ERAD)which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous congenital disorders. Therefore, ERAD has been a promis ing target for therapy of such diseases. In this study wecompare and contrast the degradation behavior of equiva lent disease causing mutations in LDLR and VLDLR, two LDLR family receptors. Materials and Methods: HRD1 SEL1L knockout (KO) HEK293 cell lines have been generated using CRISPR/ Cas9. The missense mutants were generated by Quik Change site directed mutagenesis. The expressed proteins were analyzed biochemically and by microscopy. Results: We found that the disequilibrium syndrome causing VLDLR missense mutants (p. D487Y, p. D521H and p. C706F) are retained in the ER whereas only p. D482H and p. C667F of the LDLR corresponding mutants are retained. Two of the ER retained VLDLR mutants were found to be aggregation prone leading to ER stress as measured by spliced XBP mRNA levels. However, there was no differ ences between LDLR wild type and mutants with regard to their aggregation status or ER stress. Treatment with inhi bitors of autophagy seemed to stabilize the degradation ofwild type receptors. In addition, p. C706F VLDLR mutant stabilized during early phase of both proteasomal and autophagy inhibition. Cycloheximide chase analysis inSEL1L KO cells revealed that the HRD1 SEL1L complex could be involved in the clearance of ER retained VLDLR mutants. Conclusions: The downstream degradation and ER stress induction behavior of ER retained corresponding LDLR and VLDLR mutants are divergent suggesting differentclearance mechanisms despite their structural similarities.

It's often accompanied by other types of myocardium remodeling. Several guidelines recommendDNA diagnostics for LVNC patients but strategy remains unclear. The aim of our study is to evaluate ef ï¬ciency of DNA diagnostic in LVNC patients using gene panel (13candidate genes). Materials and Methods: We observed 67 probands diagnosed with LVNC. Deep phenotyping was performedincluding evaluation of cardiac remodeling (dilatation, hypertrophy or isolated noncompaction). Genetic screening by NGS (Ion Torrent) sequencing of 13 genes was per formed for all patients. Sanger sequencing of additional genes and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed if needed. Pathogenecity of genetic variants was analyzedaccording to ACMG Recommendations (2015). Results. Overall 33 genetic variants in 30 probands (45% of cases) were ascribed to III V classes of pathogenicity: 12 variantswere classi ï¬ed as likely pathogenic/pathogenic, and 21 as variants of unknown signi ï¬cance. Ef ï¬ciency of DNA diagnostic was 22.4% in whole cohort but it varied sig niï¬cantly depending on cardiac remodeling. The highest rate of V IV class variants was found in âLVNC+cardiac hypertrophy âsubgroup (53%). In subgroup âLVNC+car diac dilation âvariants of V IV class were detected in 14% of probands. We detected no mutations in isolated LVNC cases. Conclusion: Phenotype driven strategy might be useful for decision making in LVNC patients. Screening of 13 genes might be cost effective in âLVNC+cardiac hyper trophy âsubgroup. In patients with isolated LVNC/LVNC and dilatation WES might be preferred.

It is the most often diagnosed hereditary arrhythmic disorder with prevalence 1:2000. The KCNQ1 gene is one of the 3 major genes ( KCNQ1 ,KCNH2 and SCN5A ) which account for 75 % of the genetically identi ï¬ed LQTS cases. The same KCNQ1 mutation c.926C>T (p. T309I) was identi ï¬ed in 10 putatively unrelated families. Materials and Methods: 11 highly polymorphic short tandem repeats (STR) markers were chosen for haplotypeanalysis in 10 families. Multiplex PCR and fragment ana lysis were performed to identify variant linked to the mutation across families. Single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) analysis was performed with HumanKaryomap 12 DNA Analysis Kit (Illumina) in one member of each family. 6219 SNPs on p arm of chromosome 11 wereanalysed. Results: The same haplotype was identi ï¬ed in the nearest region of the mutation spot in every family by STR analysisand then con ï¬rmed by SNP analysis, which also identi ï¬ed possible crossing overs. The maximum size of the area shared by all families is 658407 bp and contains the wholesequence of KCNQ1 gene. The maximum size of the area shared by two families is 12633501 bp. Conclusion: Allelic frequencies of identi ï¬ed alleles in STR markers in control population suggest that there is only one common ancestor with mutation c.926C>T in the group of families investigated in this study.

Using gene panel and exome sequen cing, we identi ï¬edï¬ve additional probands carrying likely pathogenic LOX variants, including three missense variants, affecting highly conserved amino acids and absent from gnomAD. The two stopcodons, (c.(351delC)) and p.(Gly149*), were identi ï¬ed in males with type A dissection at 19 and 51 years without family history. The ï¬rst proband also suffered from splenic rupture, pneumothorax andvaricose veins whereas the second presented with ï¬at feet and inguinal hernia surgery. A p.(Thr99Ala) missense variant was found in a Marfan syndrome like male withTAA. The second missense variant, p.(Met298Arg), was discovered in 46 year old female presenting with left carotid and prior coronary artery dissection. Interestingly, theidentical LOX variant previously segregated in ï¬ve affected members of a TAAD family. The woman presented skin hyperelasticity with recurrent shoulder dislocations. Hermother is known with berry aneurysm, but not available for genetic testing. The last missense variant, p.(Leu306Pro), was found in a tall male with dilatation of the aorta sinusand ascendens with elective surgery at age 15.

30332,"Carlo IRCCS Mediterranean Institute for Transplantation and Advanced Specialized Therapies (ISMETT), Palermo, Italy Introduction: Left ventricular non compaction (LVNC) is a rare hereditary cardiomyopathy, resulting from abnormal embryonic myocardial development. The most prevalent Congenital Heart Disease in LVNC is Ebstein anomaly (EA), characterized by apical displacement and partial fusion of the septal and posterior lea ï¬et of the tricuspid valve with the ventricular septum. Materials and Methods: We present the case of 46 years old male affected by EA and LVNC. MR imaging shows an Ebstein anomaly, in which the origin of the septal lea ï¬et is displaced downward into the right ventricle, dividing it into a proximal atrialized anddistal ventricularized (true or functional ventricle) cham bers. These features, in addition to annular dilatation, result in valve regurgitation and right chambers dilatation. MRimaging shows the coexistence of left ventricle hyper trabeculation with spongy appearance of the myocardium consistent with left ventricular non compaction. Genetic counselling was offered. He reported that his nephew was affected by EA and she died at three months of age. Molecular analysis by NGS target panel was performedto our patient. Results: We identi ï¬ed a heterozygous missense variant (c.728G>A) p. Arg243His in MYH7 gene, classi ï¬ed as pathogenic according to ACMG Guidelines. This variant was originally reported in an individual with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, has subsequently beenreported in multiple individuals with LVNC and in an individual with isolated EA. Conclusions: The association between EA, LVNC and mutations in MYH7 , seems to represent a subtype of Ebsteinanomaly with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance.

30333,"1Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain, 2Hospital General Universitario Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n, Madrid, Spain Heart failure is considered one of the main causes of death in developed countries. Moreover, it is a disease that is inï¬uenced by multiple genetic risk factors and the only effective treatment when there are no medical or surgicalalternatives would be heart transplant. The aim of this study is to genetically characterized patients whose undergo heart transplantation. We sequenced 65 transplanted patients for acomprehensive cardiovascular gene panel of 209 genes, using Ion semiconductor chips technology in a Ion GeneStudio S5 Sequencer. We identi ï¬ed 29 patients with rare variants (either not described or gnomAD frequency â¤ 0.0001). Twenty two of them were single carriers (75.9%), six harbor two variants (20.6%), and in one case weidenti ï¬ed three variants (3.5%). Regarding to its patho genicity, eight patients were carriers of at least a variant classi ï¬ed as pathogenic by ClinVar database, six as variants of unknown signi ï¬cance, and the others have no classi ï¬ca tion. The reason for transplantation of these carriers was due to ischemic heart disease in 48% of cases, 29% to dilatedcardiomyopathy, 4% valvular, 4% hypertrophic and 15% to another type of heart disease. In conclusion, we have identi ï¬ed a signi ï¬cant percentage of new or rare genetic variants in genes that would be associated with heart diseases in a heart transplanted cohort. Therefore, detection of these variants might be helpful to achieve an earlydiagnosis of these diseases. Further co segregation and functional studies have to be performed in order to accomplish an accurate variant classi ï¬cation. E. Cuesta Llavona: None. J. GÃ³mez: None. B. DÃ­az Molina: None. J.

Valverde1 1University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain,2Servicio de NeumologÃ­a, Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Pontevedra, Vigo, Spain Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a disease characterized by an increase of secretion and deregulation of Endothelin 1 (ET 1). This peptide is secreted by theendothelium of blood vessels and promotes vasoconstric tion. We carried out the characterization of the UTR regions of endothelin 1gene ( EDN 1 ), in order to determine common variations that may modulate disease outcome. The analysis was carried out in 60 patients with different classes of PAH, testing a fragment of 2 kb for both UTRregion. An in silico analysis was performed to evaluate binding transcription factors. Luciferase assay was done to evaluate in vitro the SNP in ï¬uence in gene expression. Data revealed the presence of a deletion in the promoter region (rs397751713), while a transversion in the 3 âUTR region was found (rs2859338). The distribution of the genotypefrequencies in our PAH patients were: for rs397751713: A/ A: 0.08; A/ : 0.27; / : 0.66; for rs2859338: A/A: 0.15; A/G: 0.60; G/G: 0.25. Variations are located in a KLF4 bindingsequence and a vitamin D receptor binding sequence respectively. Both transcription factors are related to PAH development. In conclusion, these SNPs in the UTR regionsofEDN1 are related with gene expression levels, as we measured higher expression rates for patients with A/A and G/G genotype. Moreover, we hypothesized that this over expression is due to the inability of KLF4 and vitamin D receptor to attach the target sequence and to regulate the expression of EDN1 , as KLF4 is probe to avoid PAH when present and vitamin D is an anti hypertrophic factor.

Methods: We used targeted panel sequencing with a custom panel (HAP v1.2) including 21 genes in 318 PAH patients from the Spanish registry (REHAP). After detecting several changes in ABCC8 we carried out a functional analysis by minigene assay to evaluate possible splicing variants (8/10). Lastly, we used protein modeling by homology (Phyre2) to evaluate the pathogenicity of thechanges at protein level assessing its stability with MODELLER. Results: After validation, we identi ï¬ed ten variants in the ABCC8 gene that had never been related to PAH: c.298G>A:p.(Glu100Lys), c.2176G>A p.(Ala726Thr) and c.3238G>A:p.(Val1080Ile) were classi ï¬ed as neutral. c.2422C>A:p.(Gln808Lys) and c.3976G>A:p.(Glu1326 Lys) were classi ï¬ed as likely pathogenic. c.1429G>A:p. (Val477Met), c.1643C>T:p.(Thr548Met), c.2694 +1G>A, c.3288_3289del:p.(His1097ProfsTer16) and c.3394G>A:p. (Asp1132Asn) were classi ï¬ed as pathogenic. Minigenes conï¬rmed the pathogenicity of c.3394G>A:p. (Asp1132Asn) inducing an exon skipping, and the correct processing of c.298G>A:p.(Glu100Lys) and c.1643C>T:p. (Thr548Met). But they were inconclusive for 5 variants,none of the encoded exons transcribed correctly even in the wild type. Protein modeling of the possible outcomes revealed that amino acid changes would not alter proteinstability. The skipping of exons 20, 27 and 32 would yield unstable proteins, while skipping of exon 22 would barely affect stability. Conclusions: We identi ï¬ed ten variants in ABCC8 , conï¬rmed experimentally the pathogenicity of c.3394G>A: p.(Asp1132Asn) and bioinformatically c.3288_3289del:p.(His1097ProfsTer16).

Materials and Methods: The DNA samples from patients clinically classi ï¬ed as having probable or de ï¬nitive familial hypercholesterolemia(FH), were analysed by NGSusing a customized panel of 198 genes. The new variants found in PCSK9 were generated into the expression vector PCSK9 _NM_174936.3 Human cDNA GFPSpark Â® tag by site directed mutagenesis. The constructs were transfected in HepG2 cells. We measure both activity and expression of LDLR by ï¬ow cytometry in order to determine the impact ofPCSK9 variants. Results: In silico study showed six variants in PCSK9: c.289C>T;p.(Arg97Cys), c.1130C>G;p.(Thr377Ser),c.1495C>T;p.(Arg499Cys), c.1633A>G;p.(Ser545Gly), c.1978G>A;p.(Asp660Asn), c.1987A>G;p.(Thr663Ala) with potential effect in PCSK9. The variant c.1978G>A;p.(Asp660Asn) had a 15% decreased level of internalization of LDL and 20% decreased level of LDLR expression regarding WT PCSK9. The rest of variants had the same orincremented level of LDL internalization and expression of LDLR regarding WT PCSK9.Conclusions: The functional characterization of variants inPCSK9 has allowed us to classify the variants avoiding theâuncertain signi ï¬cance âvariants and thus to con ï¬rm the genetic diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. The results suggest that the variant c.1978G>A;p.(Asp660Asn) could explain the raised level of LDL c in the patient being a newcase of FH3 due to gain of function variant in PCSK9. S.

We will also utilize NMR metabolomic risk information in disease prevention. Materials and Methods: Based on follow up data from national health care registries we modelled PRS in whole genome genotyped population based FINRISK cohorts withmultiple registry follow up for incident cases (N ,21726) using Cox regression models. We modelled the impact of genetic and traditional risk factors on a risk of diseasewithin the next 10 years. Results: We compared the CAD classi ï¬cation of Cox regression model with traditional risk factors and polygenicadditive model with 6,6M variants. From basic model risk class 10 20% PRS reclassi ï¬ed 205 participants to highest >20% risk class. In FINRISK participants risk for CAD washigher for men and smoking adds to risk of disease in all PRS classes. Risk for disease increases with BMI being highest in BMI class 30 35. Conclusions: The validation showed that adding PRS to the traditional risk factors signi ï¬cantly changed the risk enabling reclassi ï¬cation of as many as 17% of the partici pants.

They comprise long and short QT syndromes (LQTS/SQTS), Brugada syn drome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventriculartachycardia (CPVT). Although nearly 30 genes have been associated with arrhythmogenic channelopathies so far, the mutation detection rate in syndromes other than LQTS isrelatively low (~15 65%), therefore their molecular pro ï¬le remains largely unknown. Patients and Results: A 62 gene panel comprising known and candidate genes was used for NGS screening of 12 patients with PVT associated channelopathy. In 8 patients we identi ï¬ed 4 known and 6 novel, likely patho genic variants in KCNH2 ,RYR2 andSCN5A . Additionally, rare variants of unknown signi ï¬cance in AKAP9, KCNA5, KCNH2, KCNT1, MYH6, SCNN1A, TRDN, TTN were found in 6 cases. Interestingly, in one CPVT patient two novel RYR2 variants inherited from healthy parents co occured, suggesting recessive pattern of inheritance. In twoother patients diagnosed with PVT and LQTS possibility ofdigenic inheritance or genetic synergism, associated with changes in RYR2 andKCNH2 , has been postulated. Conclusions: PVT related channelopathies remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Phenotypic expression and/or variable penetration observed in the disease may result from the con ï¬uence of defects in different genes encoding or modulating ion channels âfunction. NGS technology provides foundation to better understanding of the genetic pro ï¬le, phenotype genotype correlations and etiopathological mechanisms of PVT. Improved detection of risk factors will in ï¬uence genetic counseling and ther apeutic decision making, preventing severe consequences,like sudden cardiac death. Partially supported: CMHI M31/18. M.

About 30% of patients with idiopathic/heritable PAH have variants in BMPR2 . The causative genes, if any, in the remaining 70% of patients have yet to be clari ï¬ed. Since we reported 2 unrelated patients with homozygosity for RNF213 p. Arg4810Lys who had Moyamoya disease and severepulmonary hypertension in 2016, we suspected RNF213 would be causative gene for PAH. Method: We performed whole exome sequencing for 76 patients (19 males, 57 females) with idiopathic PAH who had been negative for BMPR2 and other known pathogenic gene mutations. Result: We identi ï¬edRNF213 p. Arg4810Lys in a het erozygous state in 7 (9.2%) of the 76 PAH patients. Since the minor allele frequency for the p. Arg4810Lys is 0.77%in the normal Japanese population, individuals who are heterozygous for the p. Arg4810Lys might be predisposed toAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1327PAH. From a therapeutic standpoint, patients with the RNF213 p. Arg4810Lys were low responders to PAH speciï¬c vasodilators. The event free rate of death or lung transplantation was signi ï¬cantly poorer in RNF213 p. Arg4810Lys variant carriers than in BMPR2 variants car riers (5 year event free rate since the introduction of pros taglandin I2 infusion, 0% vs. 93%, P<0.001). Conclusion: We demonstrated that nearly 10% of patients with PAH were heterozygous for the RNF213 p. Arg4810Lys. Documentation of an RNF213 p. Arg4810Lys might provide clinically relevant information when select ing pharmacologic interventions.

Current classi ï¬cation based on clinical features, does not re ï¬ect the underlying molecular proï¬ling of these groups, and patients from different groups can share clinical features that could be associated with their response. The advance in the massive paralleled sequencing technologies has allowed describing several new genesrelated to PAH, improving diagnosis ratio and a better clinical characterization Thus, our aimed was to address the molecular diagnosis of patients with any form PAH Material and Methods: 318 patients were included in the analysis. 21 gene NGS custom panel was designed the sequencing was performed with a MiSeq. Custom scriptwas developed to annotate and ï¬lter the variants. Results: Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were found in 13% of the patients with a 14% of variants ofunknown signi ï¬cance. Interesting, we have found variants in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) andcongenital heart disease (CHD). In CTD, we have found one pathogenic mutation and four VUS and, and for CHD two pathogenic variants and 6 VUS. In addition, in a small proportion of patients (0,93%) digenic mode of inheritance was detected. Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of the genetic screening of PAH and allow to detect variants in PAH associated forms not described previously. Molecular conï¬rmation of the clinical suspicious is mandatory in cases with clinical overlapping and to perform a properly man agement and follow up of the patients.

Materials and Methods: The index case and her rela tives underwent full cardiological assessment. Genetic analysis of the index case was performed using Illumina'sTrusight Cardio sequencing panel and Sanger sequencing was used to screen members of the family for the presence of the reported mutation. Results: Here we describe a female proband with a severely manifested restrictive phenotype leading to heart transplantation at the age of 41 who was found homozygousfor the novel TNNI3 mutation: NM_000363.4:c.586G>C, p. (Asp196His). Her parents were third degree cousins origi nating from a small village and although they were foundheterozygous for the same variant they displayed no symptoms of the disease. Her older sister who was also1328found heterozygous was asymptomatic. Her twin sister and her brother who were homozygous for the same variant displayed a restrictive and a hypertrophic phenotype, respectively.

Muta tions are detected in 20% of the patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS), an inherited cardiac arrhythmia that predisposes to sudden cardiac death (SCD). We haveidenti ï¬ed a loss of function SCN5A founder mutation (c.4813 +3_4813 +6dupGGGT) in 23 different Belgian families. We recruited 89 mutation carriers and their clinical spectrum ranges from completely asymptomatic to palpita tions, syncopes and SCD. This provides us with a unique patient cohort to study modi ï¬ers that play a role in this variable expressivity and we decided to create patient speciï¬c induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocytes (CM) as a model for further investigations. Materials and Methods: Dermal ï¬broblasts from a skin biopsy of two patients with different phenotypic severity and two unrelated control individuals were reprogrammedusing Sendai viral vectors. The resulting iPSCs were vali dated using immunostaining, RT qPCR and embryoid bodyformation, and for each individual three iPSC clones were established. For differentiation to iPSC CMs we followed two published protocols and evaluated the cells using immunostaining and patch clamp experiments. Results: Optimization of the methods resulted in robust patient and control iPSC CM models. The patient cellsdisplayed a reduced sodium current compared to the control iPSC CMs. Conclusion: We established iPSC CM models for a unique Belgian SCN5A founder mutation displaying remarkable variable expressivity. Further experiments including transcriptomics, whole genome sequencing,electrophysiological and functional investigations will enable us to identify genetic modi ï¬ers and unravel their mechanism of action. This will hopefully stimulate thedevelopment of novel drugs for cardiac arrhythmias. M. Alaerts: None. A. Nijak: None. E. Simons: None. E. Sieliwonczyk: None. D. Schepers: None. B.

These vascular damages areAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1329associated with multisystemic signs including premature osteoarthritis. SMAD3 encodes one of the canonical TGF Î² pathway members whose defect is involved in connective tissue disorders such as Loeys Dietz syndrome and represents a rare cause (2%) of familial thoracic aneurysms and dissections. Clinical variability and incomplete pene trance are commonly associated with pathogenic SMAD3 variants. This prompted us to review all the individuals for which a SMAD3 mutation was identi ï¬ed in our Reference Centre and to compare these with published cases, to determine any genotype phenotype correlation associated with mutations of this gene. Here, we report clinical andgenetic data from 20 new cases from 8 families from our Reference Centre. After a complete review of the literature, we collected a total of 49 unique variants of different nature,from 151 individuals of 58 unrelated families, including missense, truncating and splicing variants. This report conï¬rms the absence of correlation between the mutation type and the phenotype severity and highlights the important inter and intra familial clinical variability and incomplete penetrance described with SMAD3 mutated patients.

KrebsovÃ¡2 1Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol, Prague 5, Czech Republic,2Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM), Prague, Czech Republic Introduction: Mutations in FLNC gene were initially related to muscular dystrophy and myo ï¬brillar myopathy but more recently, variants in FLNC were reported to cause familial cardiomyopathies in the absence of skeletal muscle defects. Truncating mutations in FLNC cause an over lapping phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy or arrhyth mogenic cardiomyopathy while missense mutations are associated with familiar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy andmight also play an important role in cases of unexplained sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young subjects. Materials and Methods: We investigated the cohort of Czech cardiac arrest (CA) survivors/victims by performing massively parallel sequencing using a custom made panel comprising 229 cardiac conditions related genes (Nimble Gen/Illumina). Detected variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, including their familial segregation and classi ï¬ed according to ACMG. Results: We have identi ï¬ed variants in FLNC gene in 3 cases. In 2/3 cases the rare variant NM_001458.4 (FLNC): c.102G>A p.(Trp34*) was found in non related Czechsubjects (26 years old male CA victim and 16 years old female CA survivor). NM_001458.4 (FLNC):c.1732G>T p. (Gly578Cys) in CA victim, where this variant was coex istent with probable causative variant in TTN gene. Conclusion: Both, truncating and missense mutations in the FLNC gene might be associated with SCA and demonstrate the clinical utility of genetic testing in at risk family members. The aim of our study is to increase the usage of genetic analysis in post mortem investigations ofSCD in the young cases in order to improve clinical man agement of relatives at risk in the Czech Republic.

This method doesn ât require matched controls. Materials and Methods: Since original background mutation rates were estimated for de novo variants, we applied a scaling factor to obtain new probabilities P' ,k*P; factor k was computed so that the number of predicted and observed ultra rare variants match. We applied the same method pooling expected probabilities and observed var iants by pathway, to boost power. We addressed the pro blem of gene set correlations by using a greedy step down aggregation approach; and computed a sampling basedFDR only for aggregated gene sets. We tested gene sets derived from Gene Ontology and pathways, and MPO annotation of human orthologs in mouse. Results: By applying this method to genes predicted haploinsuf ï¬cient, we found signi ï¬cant genes: FLT4 (BH FDR~0%), NOTCH1 (BH FDR~0.5%), and etc. For GeneOntology and pathways, we found the VEGF and related pathways (FDR~0%, including FLT4,KDR, â¯), Cardiac Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Differentiation, and relatedpathways (FDR~0.08%, including NOTCH1 gene, â¯). For MPO terms, we found abnormal vitelline vascular remo deling and related pathways (FDR~0%, including FLT4,KDR,FOXO1, â¯), delayed heart looping and related pathways (FDR~0.05%, including NOTCH1 gene, â¯).

According to various studies focused on the adult patients, mutations in the TT Ngene accounts 10 30% of DCM cases. The mutation rate in the TTN gene, the characteristics of manifestations and their prognostic signiï¬cance in childhood have not been studied. Aim: To determine TTN mutation rate in children with DCM and the relevance of including this gene in the DNA diagnostic protocol for pediatric DCM. Materials and Methods: Complete clinical and instru mental examination of 36 DCM patients was conducted in cardiology centres. Genetic study had included sequencing based on the IonTorrent â¢ platform of the TTN isoform N2BA (25 isolated cases) and whole exome sequencing trios on the Illumina platform (11family cases). Results and discussion: The group included 36 probands diagnosed with DCM before 18 years (average age: 6.5years). The sex ratio (M:F) was 23: 8. The only likely pathogenic truncating variant p. Arg33703*in the TTN gene was found in a 16 year old male proband out of 36 (3%).Apparently, TTN dependent forms of DCMs manifest later at a young or more mature age. Conclusion: These results do not support the TT Ngene as the ï¬rst line of DNA diagnostics for DCM in the pediatric group.

Although heredity is a well known risk factor for varicose veins, genetic architecture of thiscondition is still poorly understood. Materials and Methods: This study is a genome wide association study with deep in silico functional follow upanalysis. Summary statistics for 408,455 European ancestry individuals were provided by the Gene ATLAS and the Neale Lab projects. Results: Seven loci associated with the risk of varicose veins were identi ï¬ed that explain 10% of the SNP based heritability. In six of them, we prioritized the most likelycausal genes CASZ1 ,PIEZO1 ,PPP3R1, EBF1 ,STIM2 , and HFE . Gene set enrichment analysis revealed gene categories related to abnormal vasculogenesis. Summary data basedMendelian Randomization analysis followed by the Het erogeneity in Dependent Instruments test showed pleio tropic effects on body mass , fat , blood and bloodpressure related traits. Genetic correlation analysis con ï¬rmed known epidemiological associations between VVs and deep venous thrombosis, weight, rough labor, andstanding job, and found a genetic overlap with multiple novel traits, including height, pain, educational attainment, ï¬uid intelligence, walking pace, smoking, and gonarthrosis. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed causal effects of plasma levels of MICB and CD209 proteins and anthro pometric traits such as height, weight, waist and hipcircumference.

The resulting de ï¬ciency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase, and accumulation of the pro in ï¬ammatory sphingolipid ceramide, causes a broad spectrum of symptoms and disease severity which may delay diagnosisor lead to misdiagnosis. The ongoing study described here is the ï¬rst comprehensive, systematic clinical study of the natural history of Farber disease. Methods: The Observational and Cross Sectional Cohort Study of the Natural History and Phenotypic Spectrum of Farber Disease (NCT03233841) is designed to collect ret rospective and prospective data including demographics, clinical presentation, phenotype, and diagnostic history of patients diagnosed with Farber disease who have or havenot undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), along with speci ï¬c prospective clinical evaluations in living patients. Results: From November 2017 to December 2018, 42 patients (25 living, 17 deceased) have been enrolled in the study. The average age of the living patients is 9 years(range 1 to 28 years). Average time from onset of ï¬rst symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years (range < 1 to 12 years). Patient countries of birth include Afghanistan, Argentina,Canada, Egypt, Germany, India, Iraq, Italy, Mexico, Swe den, Syria, Turkey, and the USA. Conclusions: Patients representing the breadth of the phenotypic spectrum of Farber disease, from rapidly pro gressive (severe), to slowly progressive (attenuated) have1332been enrolled from 15 centers (9 countries).

So far, in three out of the four nuclear encoded proteins composing succinate dehydrogenase ( SDHA ,SDHB , and SDHD ), and in one of its assembly factor genes ( SDHAF1 ), biallelic disruption has been shown to cause complex II deï¬ciency with a leukoencephalopathy as central clinical presentation. For the fourth SDH gene composing succinatedehydrogenase, SDHC , biallelic disruption has not been reported, as of yet. Methods and Results: Here we describe the clinical and molecular analysis of two siblings with biochemically conï¬rmed complex II de ï¬ciency, caused by compound heterozygous variants in SDHC (c.31C>T; p.(Arg11Cys) and c.202T>C; p.(Ser68Pro)). Segregation analysis supports the recessive pattern of inheritance: in none of four healthy siblings tested both variants were present. One patient had asevere neurological handicap and died of respiratory failure at the age of 11 years. The other sibling was found to beaffected at prenatal testing; pregnancy was ended. Inter estingly, neuroimaging in the ï¬rst patient showed pro gressive cerebral atrophy but not the typical white matter abnormalities seen in previously described complex II deï¬cient patients. This might point towards a distinct fea ture of complex II de ï¬ciency caused by SDHC disruption, compared to complex II de ï¬ciency caused by disruption of the other SDH genes and SDHAF1 . Conclusion: Here we report for the ï¬rst time two cases of complex II de ï¬ciency caused by biallelic disruption of SDHC , emphasizing the importance of screening all SDH genes in patients with (or suspected of) complex IIdeï¬ciency.

The dilemma for a clinician is overlapping symptoms in majority of amino, organic & fatty acid disorders like failure to thrive, seizures, vomiting, poorfeeding, metabolic acidosis, lethargy, and developmental delay. Hence, a need of metabolic test to cover a large spectrum of disorders in one test. Materials and Methods: The urinary metabolic pro ï¬ling to cover more than 140 metabolic abnormalities was developed for screening the 5880 patients. The con ï¬rmed diagnosis was by gas chromatography /mass spectrometry or mutational analysis. Results: The 48 % (2856 of 5880 cases) were diagnosed to have metabolic abnormality. Amino and organic acido pathies accounted highest as a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Overall, low birth weight (34%), convulsions(33%), premature birth (27%), acidosis, refusal to feed (13%) and respiratory distress (13%) were recorded, with consanguinity, history of mental retardation and death ofearlier sibs as other high risk genetic factors. This high risk screening indicated that which metabolic disorders are more frequent in Indian population and a need of strategic plan ning for newborn screening at affordable cost.1334Conclusions: The method used for diagnosis covered a large spectrum of metabolic disorders in a shortest time with cost effective approach & was found signi ï¬cant in a resource constraint Indian scenario. Our experience & data will be demonstrated emphasizing genetic counselling & prenatal mutational diagnosis in few illustrative cases alongwith issues & challenges while implementation of the study.

Its de ï¬ciency leads to cystinosis, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. Here, we report a patient with Infantile Nephropathic type of cystinosis (INC). Materials and Methods: Total RNAs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of participants and primary ï¬bro blasts were extracted by the standard Trizol based method. The cDNA structure analysis was performed by electro phoresis (EP) following Reverse Transcription PCR (RT PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Results: The cDNA structure analysis of all exons of the CTNS revealed homozygous loss of 4th and 5th exons. On the DNA level we con ï¬rmed 9 kb deletion, spanning region from 3 rdto 5thintrons. In order to identify the inheritance pattern we analyzed the pro band's mother's CTNS gene both on the cDNA and the DNA levels. Mother was foundto be heterozygous for the same mutation. Conclusions: For INC diagnostics we showed advantages of cDNA sequencing versus DNA sequencing. First of all,in case of some genes, such as CTNS , it is cheaper to sequence cDNA fragments rather than all exons separately. We ampli ï¬edCTNS cDNA, consisting of 12 exons,as 3 separate fragments. Secondly, long enough deletions or insertions could be detected by electrophoresis with fol lowing con ï¬rmation by DNA sequencing. We estimate this novel deletion to be classi ï¬ed as pathogenic according to ACMG criteria because it leads to a truncated CTNS protein. V. Serzhanova: None. A. Filatova: None. S. Papizh: None. M.

It is characterised by early onset neurological symptoms includ ing hypotonia and seizures, developmental delay and eventual neuroregression. Survival beyond 36 months is rare. Diagnosis relies on the detection of accumulated levelsof VLCFAs in plasma but occasional patients have undetectable or near normal plasma levels, sometimes associated with longer survival. We report a 9 year old male patient born to non consanguineous northern European parents, presenting with neonatal seizures and global developmental delay fromearly infancy. Developmental progress was made until around 4 years, after which steady neuro regression was seen. Metabolic testing of urine and plasma, includingVLCFAs, demonstrated normal ï¬ndings on multiple occasions. Trio based whole exome sequencing undertaken through the DDD study identi ï¬ed compound heterozyosity for a missense and a frameshift variant in HSD17B4, consistent with DBP de ï¬ciency. The diagnosis was con ï¬rmed by enzyme analysis in cultured skin ï¬broblasts which showed reduced DBP activity (mildly reduced hydratase activity; undetectable dehydrogenase activity) despite a persistentnormal VLCFA pro ï¬le, consistent with type III DBP deï¬ciency. This case highlights the unreliability of plasma VLCFA in the diagnosis of DBP de ï¬ciency, particularly when residual enzymatic activity may be present.

It varies from asymptomatic to severe neurological manifesta tions and an increased risk of toxicity from 5 ï¬uorouracil treatment. Materials and Methods: A child with severe autistic behavior, intellectual disability (no speech at 6 years old) and family history aunt with mental retardation, was referred for genetic counseling. Metabolic screening wasperformed in urine sample by dipstick glucose, ketone, pH, and reducing sugars, followed by LC MS/MS blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines and GC/MS urine organicacids analysis. Mutations in DPYD gene are reported in DPD de ï¬ciency patients. The gene was investigated by direct Sanger sequencing in proband and his parents. Results: Elevated levels of thymine and uracil were detected by GC/MS urine test which was suggestive of DPD deï¬ciency. Molecular analysis of DPYD gene showed a homozygous splice site mutation c.1905 +1G>A in the proband, inherited from heterozygous parents. Subse quently, prenatal testing in the family was performed. Thefetus was healthy non carrier. Conclusion: Here we report the ï¬rst Bulgarian patient with severe autistic disorder caused by DPD de ï¬ciency and subsequent prenatal diagnostics performed in the family. As patients with this de ï¬ciency could be easily detected by determination of the thymine uraciluria, screening for thesedefects are indicative for all patients with any autistic behavior and intellectual disability.

Haick2 1Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, United States,2Technion âIsrael Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are individually rare but often devastating illnesses characterized by the toxic accumulation of metabolites. Early diagnosis, frequentmonitoring, and dietary intervention starting in early infancy substantially decrease morbidity and mortality. However, current diagnosis and monitoring methods rely onrepeated blood draws and costly laboratory tests with prolonged turnaround times. Thus, a non invasive, ef ï¬cient, and rapid approach is needed. Here, we present a novelapproach for monitoring patients with IEMs based on analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath samples using a nanomaterial based sensor array, theelectronic nose (eNose). Exhaled breath was collected from 31 patients with IEMs and 34 healthy controls and analyzed using both eNose and gas chromatography mass spectro metry (GC MS). IEM patients comprised 21 patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), three patients with ornithine transcarboxylase de ï¬ciency, and 7 patients with various other IEMs. Machine learning based pattern recognition algorithms were used to identify breath pro ï¬les that distinguished IEM patients from healthy controls with78% accuracy, 80 87% sensitivity, and 71 77% speci ï¬city. When restricting the analysis to patients with PKU, these patients could be distinguished from healthy controls with78% accuracy, 80% sensitivity, and 76% speci ï¬city. GC MS showed that dodecane, 5 butylnonane, and a propanoic acid derived compound were signi ï¬cantly elevated in breath samples from PKU patients. Each of these compounds reliably discriminated PKU patients from controls (c statistic ,0.786 0.815). Together, these results suggest that breath analysis could become a viable non invasive clinical monitoring and screening tool for IEMs and other disorders that affect pediatric populations. M.

30354,"Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital Research Institute, Lodz, Poland Introduction: Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare AD transmitted disorder characterized by abnormal dis tribution of adipose tissue. There are six different types ofFLP based on genetic background. The most common form is FPL type 2 (Dunnigan disease) caused by mutation in LMNA gene. Typical clinical features of patients with FLP are excessive subcutaneous fat accumulation in the neck and face, reduced subcutaneous fat in the arms and legs and muscular appearance due to muscular hypertrophy. Theextent of adipose tissue loss usually determines the severity of the associated metabolic complications such as hyper glycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistant diabetes mel litus, increased serum triglicerydes, hepatic steatosis, pancreatitis, high blood pressure, and premature athero sclerosis with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Materials and Methods: Among 64 patients tested using custom NGS panel due to familiar dyslipidemia, 9 showed lipodystrophic features. Similarity of the phenotypic traitsand characteristic signi ï¬cant hypertriglyceridemia sug gested the diagnosis of FPL type 2. Results: The study revealed the presence of R482Q alteration in LMNA gene in 4 subjects in two families and R148K in PPARG gene in two subjects in one family. Conclusions: Recognition of FPL type 2 and type 3 conï¬rm the molecular heterogeneity of familial partial lipodystrophy. Identi ï¬cation of patients with FPL is chal lenging due to variable and often mild phenotype. Severehypertriglyceridemia was consistent and easy to identify feature.

A variety of mutations have been reported in the L ferritin subunit gene ( FTL gene) that cause the following ï¬ve diseases: (1) hereditary hyperferri tinemia with cataract syndrome (HHCS), (2) neuroferritino pathy, a subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), (3) benign hyperferritinemia, (4) L ferritin de ï¬ciency with autosomal dominant inheritance, and (5) L ferritin de ï¬ciency with autosomal recessive inheri tance. Defects in the FTL gene lead to abnormally high levels of serum ferritin (hyperferritinemia) in HHCS and benign hyperferritinemia, while low levels (hypoferritine mia) are present in neuroferritinopathy and in autosomaldominant and recessive L ferritin de ï¬ciency. Methods: We have sequenced FTL gene either by Sanger sequencing or by next generation sequencing (NGS) inthree families with abnormal levels of ferritin. Moreover, we have performed an extensive review of all reported variants in the FTL gene linked with the previouslydescribed ï¬ve conditions. Results: Here, we identi ï¬ed two novel FTL variants that cause dominant L ferritin de ï¬ciency and HHCS (c.375 +2T > A and 36_42delCAACAGT, respectively), and one pre viously reported variant (Met1Val) that causes dominant L ferritin de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: Globally, genetic changes in the FTL gene are responsible for multiple phenotypes and an accurate diagnosis is useful for appropriate treatment. We included adiagnostic algorithm for the detection of diseases caused by defects in FTL gene.

Majority of the patho genic variants are small sequence alterations, nevertheless gross alterations have also been reported (1%). We aimed to investigate the frequency and distribution of GALT muta tions in Turkish galactosemia patients with genotype phenotype correlation. Material and Methods: Clinically and biochemically diagnosed 91 patients with galactosemia were included in this study. Algorithmic genetic testing strategy for GALT was performed initially with Sanger sequencing (n ,91) followed by MLPA (n ,19), only for cases with incompa tible sequence result. Results: We identi ï¬ed 11 known and four novel patho genic variants (p. R67Pfs*19, p. S236Rfs*30, p. S156*, p. V243I) in 91 patients leading to 95% detection rate. Ret rospective investigation of mutation unidenti ï¬ed cases were tentatively considered galactosemia initially however deviated in follow ups. Conclusions: As in European cohorts, p. Q188R in exon 6 was the most common (38%) GALT mutations. Second most frequent mutation was p. E340* (14%) in exon 10, which is known to be speci ï¬c for population in Turkey. The third most frequent mutation (8%) was a novel single nucleotide deletion leading to frameshift (p. R67Pfs*19) in exon 2, found to aggregate in patients from eastern Turkey. Algorithmic analysis of exons 6 and 10 would delineate molecular genetic diagnosis for 60% of the patients. Absence of gross mutations is attributed to our small samplesize.

In addition, heterozygous GBA1 mutations represent the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson âs disease. We aimed to determine the GBA1 mutational spectrum among GD patients and the frequency of common GBA1 mutations among the general population from R. Macedonia. Material and Methods: Thirty four individuals belong ing to 10 families with 15 GD Type 1 patients, as well as 392 individuals from the general population were studied. GD patients were studied using several different methods:direct DNA sequencing of GBA1 exons, Multiplex Ligation Probe Dependent Ampli ï¬cation (MLPA), and next generation sequencing on MiSeq using Illumina TruSightInherited panel. Allele speci ï¬c ampli ï¬cation was designed to screen for ï¬ve common GBA1 mutations among the general population. Results: A total of eight pathogenic variants (c.115 +1G>A, c.392A>G, c.882T>G, c.1226A>G, c.1263 1317del, c.1312G>A, c.1342G>C and c.1363A>G) weredetected. The most common mutation was c.1226A>G (N370S), representing 60% of GBA1 alleles. The c.882T>G and c.1342G>C were present on one allele (H255Q:D409H). The novel c.392A>G variant was detected in one GD patient as a de novo event. The frequencies of GBA1 mutations among the general population were the follow ing: c.1226A>G (3/700, 0.43%), c.882T>G/c.1342G>C (2/ 784, 0.26%), c.115 +1G>A (1/668, 0.15%), while c.1263 1317del was not detected among the studied individuals.

Mutations in PPARG cause familial partial lipodystrophy subtype 3 (FPLD3), characterized by adiposetissue redistribution causing type 2 diabetes, and dyslipide mia. In two non consanguineous patients we identi ï¬ed PPAR Î³E379K and R212Q. The mutations are situated in distinct domains of the PPAR Î³. Whereas, E379K is located in the ligand binding domain (LBD) and contacts the DNA binding domain (DBD) of its binding partner RXR Î±in the PPAR Î³ RXR Î± DNA crystal structure, R212Q is located in the hinge region and interacts with the DNA. Methods and materials: We have used genome wide sequencing basedstrategies in PPARG knockout mouse embryonic ï¬broblasts transduced with PPAR Î³to determine how these PPARG mutations that do not interfere in interactions with RXR Î±, ligand, and cofactors, but do impair the adipogenic capacity affect the ability of PPAR Î³to activate PPARG target genes in the context of native chromatin structure. Results: Both PPARG mutations impair the transactiva tion potential of PPAR Î³on an overlapping subset of target genes. Classical PPAR Î³target genes such as FABP4 , ANGPTL4 , and LPL are among the genes that are highly affected. Genome wide pro ï¬ling of PPAR Î³(WT and mutants) and the enhancer activity marker H3K27Ac showsthat these PPARG mutations impair PPAR Î³binding on enhancers that require PPAR Î³for chromatin remodeling. Conclusion: These ï¬ndings indicate that a subset of PPAR Î³target genes are sensitive to PPARG mutations.

Mutations in the GFM1 gene, encoding the mitochondrial translationelongation factor EFG1, have been linked to mitochondrial diseases with neurologic or hepatic presentations in few patients. Here, we further expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of GFM1 linked disease mutations by reporting clinical, biochemical and neuroimaging ï¬ndings from 9 unrelated pediatric patients harboring homozygous or compound heterozygous GFM1 mutations, including 10 novel pathogenic variants. All patients were born at term and without fetal distress. In 8/9 children, the ï¬rsts clinical signs were noticed during the neonatal period. Only 1 child had psychomotor regres sion and lactic acidosis (8 months) after initial normal development. All patients presented with neurological involvement with axial hypotonia and dystonia being themajor signs. West syndrome was frequently observed (5/9 patients). One child had liver failure. Western blot analysis on patient ï¬broblasts revealed that all mutations result in decreased abundance of the mutant EFG1 protein. Speci ï¬c decrease of mtDNA encoded proteins con ï¬rmed that mitochondrial translation was impaired in patients, which inturn, resulted in an impaired biogenesis of OXPHOS complexes I and IV. In conclusion, GFM1 mutations result in OXPHOS deï¬ciency and constant neurological involvement with hypotonia, dystonia, and epilepsy.

Surviving patients have profound devel opmental delay and severe, usually pharmacoresistantepilepsy. Cerebral spinal ï¬uid (CSF) and plasma glycine levels are elevated as well as CSF:plasma glycine ratio. NKH is an autosomal recessive disorder with causativemutations identi ï¬ed in genes encoding the components of GCS GLDC ,AMT andGCSH . We present the results of mutation analysis in seven patients with classical formof NKH. Materials and Methods: Analysis of the GLDC and AMT genes was performed by Sanger sequencing and MLPA. Results: Mutations in the GLDC gene, including a large deletion of exons 10 to 25, were detected in four patients. Five mutations (c.1420G>A, c.1543A>G, c.1877T>G, c.2594del, c.2579G>T) are novel.

Fifteen variants are novel, ï¬ve loss of functions and ten likely missense, six with unknown signi ï¬cance following the ACMG guidelines. In twenty one cases no pathogenic mutations in SLC2A1 were detected and were further ana lysed by TruSight One Â®panel, allowing the detection of pathogenic variants in eight different genes related to ion channels, transcriptional factors or cellular traf ï¬cking. Conclusions: Our results show that a response to keto genic diet, drug resistant epilepsy and/or hypoglycorrhachia is not a pathognomonic marker for GLUT1DS. Moreover, the results highlight the fact that genetic analysis should bea must have for GLUT1DS classi ï¬cation. ACCI CIBERER project: ER18P2AC746 and ERTRLEOI1 O. SÃ¡nchez Lijarcio: None. D.

30362,"Clinic of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Prague 2, Czech Republic Introduction: We implemented a targeted NGS for the diagnosis of patients with a suspicion for selected groups ofinborn errors of metabolism (IEM). Methods: A total of 195 genes were analyzed using a custom designed oligo capture probe set (Roche Nimble Gen) and MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). Positive results were conï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: In total, we identi ï¬ed 74 mutations in genes associated with IEM. The found mutations were usually SNVs or small deletions/insertions. In two cases we iden tiï¬ed gross deletions ( PHKA2 , NM_000292.2: deletion of exon 33, AGL, NM_000642.3: deletion of exons 11 21). Genes associated with glycogen metabolism were analyzed in 46 probands. The diagnosis of GSD was con ï¬rmed by ï¬nding of causative mutations in 19 of them: GYS2 (1x), G6PC (1x), AGL (4x), PYGL (2x) and PHKA2 (11x). We established the diagnosis in 3 out of 6 patients with rhab domyolyses (2x RYR1 ,1 x PFKM ). Four out of 6 patients were diagnosed in the group of peroxisomal disorders (1x PEX1 ,1 x PEX12 ,2 x HSD17B4 ). Among 17 patients with hyperhomocysteinemia we identi ï¬ed 1 patient with CblD deï¬ciency ( MMADHC ), 2 patients with FTCD de ï¬ciency, and 3 patients with the MTHFR de ï¬ciency. In two patients with biochemical ï¬ndings leading to urea cycle disorders we diagnosed 1 patient with argininosuccinic aciduria ( ASL) and 1 patient with CPSI de ï¬ciency. The diagnostic yield for MSUD was 100% (1x BCKDHA ,8 x BCKDHB ). Conclusions: The correlation of phenotypic signs, bio chemical ï¬ndings and NGS results is crucial for completing the diagnosis of IEM. Support: MZ CR RVO VFN64165, SVV No.260367 L. Dvorakova: None.

The disease is due to heterozygous mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes the sole iron export protein reported in mammals; namely ferroportin 1 (FPN1). A largephenotypic heterogeneity is observed in adult patients. This is partially explained by the existence of two categories of genetic variants: loss of function mutations, which lead to aprogressive accumulation of iron in reticuloendothelial cells, and gain of function mutations, which are responsible for a partial to complete resistance to hepcidin (the systemiciron metabolism regulatory hormone) and a progressive iron deposition in parenchymal cells. The p. Ser47Phe missense mutation was identi ï¬ed in 8 related patients presenting with an iron overload phenotype characteristic of FPN1 dysfunc tion. In vitro evaluations were performed in HEK293T cells. They revealed that the 47Phe mutant was correctlyexpressed at the cell surface, while it signi ï¬cantly reduced ability of FPN1 to export iron. They also evidenced that the 47Phe mutant was strongly resistant to hepcidin. Using a3D model of human FPN1, built by homology to the experimental structure of a bacterial homolog (BbFpn) in the outward facing state, we observed that Ser47 is locatedin the vicinity of residues that play a critical role in the transport of iron across the plasma membrane. The region might also be involved in the docking of hepcidin anddown regulation of FPN1. We conclude that p. Ser47Phe missense mutation is responsible for ambivalent functional effects, with loss of function having a predominant con sequence on phenotype. K. Uguen: None. M. Le Tertre: None. A.

Hegele1,21Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada, 2Western University, London, ON, Canada Introduction: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are often calculated in prospective cohorts representing generally healthy populations. Given the rarity of phenotypicextremes, characterizing the polygenic underpinnings of a quantitative trait âs full spectrum can be challenging. In patients referred to a specialized lipid clinic, we aimed toestablish polygenic pro ï¬les for triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL C), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL C). Materials and Methods: We performed PRS analyses using a 16 SNP TG score (N ,1,406), 9 SNP HDL C score (N,1,298), and 10 SNP LDL C score (N ,1,226). For clinical practicality, we utilized smaller PRSs that incor porate SNPs with the largest phenotypic effects. Extreme scores re ï¬ecting an excess of trait raising SNPs were deï¬ned as scores â¥90th percentile, as calculated in the 1000 Genomes cohort. Results: As TG levels increased, the prevalence of extreme TG PRSs greatly increased; patients with the highest TG levels were 5.30 fold (P<0.0001) more likely to have an extreme PRS compared to those with normal levels. As HDL C levels increased, the prevalence of extreme HDL C PRSs increased slightly; patients with the highest HDL C levels were 2.37 fold (P ,0.003) more likely to have an extreme PRS compared to those with normal levels. As LDL C levels increased, the prevalence of extreme LDL C PRSs increased slightly; however, the prevalence ofextreme PRSs was not different between patients with the highest LDL C levels and those with normal levels. Conclusions: The polygenic pro ï¬les of these lipid traits were quite distinct. Evaluation of patients at phenotypic extremes allows for more ef ï¬cient use of resources to de ï¬ne clinically relevant genetic determinants. J. S. Dron: None. J. Wang: None. H. Cao: None. M. A.

Sant Joan de DÃ©u, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is caused in 98% of cases by loss of function mutations in the gene coding for the hepatic protein phenylalanine hydroxylase(PAH). The remaining 2% accounts for defects in the synthesis or regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), cofactor of PAH and tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases(TH, TPH), both neurologically expressed. Biallelic variants in gene DNAJC12 , cochaperone of these hydroxylases, were recently described in HPA patients with neurologicalsymptoms and early onset Parkinson. Here, we report the genetic analysis of DNAJC12 in unsolved Spanish HPA cases and the functional characterization of variants. Patients and Methods: The study included DNAJC12 sequencing of 15 Spanish HPA cases (120 442 Î¼M) neu rologically asymptomatic. BH4 treatment was only requiredunder fever episodes. Functional analysis of variants was done using patient derived ï¬broblasts transiently transfected with the three hydroxylases. Results: Four novel nucleotide changes were identi ï¬ed in DNAJC12 in 15 HPA cases: two pathogenic variants probably affecting splicing (c.298 2A>C, c.502 +1G>C) and two likely pathogenic variants c.309G>T (p. Trp103Cys) and c.524G>A (p. Trp175Ter). The change p. Trp175Ter, present in 0.1% of Spanish control population,was detected in 80% of alleles, with 9 homozygous cases. DNAJC12 mRNA levels were slightly diminished and immunorreactive protein was undetectable. PAH transfec tion suggest a pathogenic effect on PAH and TH stability while no effect was found for TPH. Conclusions: DNAJC12 sequencing should be incorpo rated in routine HPA genetic con ï¬rmation of cases detected in newborn screening to apply a tailored therapy. To avoid future neurological complications, our cases should beincluded in clinical follow up. Grants: PI16/00573; LCF/PR/PR16/11110018; ERDF D. Gallego: None. F. Leal: None. M. Castro: None. I.

30366,"Introduction: Leigh syndrome (LS) associated with cytochrome coxidase (COX) de ï¬ciency is an early onset, fatal mitochondrial encephalopathy, leading to multipleneurological failure and eventually death, usually in the ï¬rst decade of life. Mutations in SURF1 , a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial protein involved in COXassembly, are the most common cause of LS. Material Methods: SURF1 gene was sequenced in 48 patients with clinical suspicion of mitochondrial disorder(mainly complex IV de ï¬ciency and LS) between January 2016 and January 2019. Demographical, clinical and molecular ï¬ndings of the patients were obtained from hospital ï¬les. Results: We identi ï¬ed 13 patients with clinical features of LS who are either homozygous or compound hetero zygous for SURF1 mutations. Of the 26 mutant alleles, 14 (54%) had null mutations (8 frameshift and 6 nonsense) 12 (46%) had missense. The most common two mutations wereC.769G>A (6/26) and c.870dupT (6/26) (%23). Although mutations in SURF1 have been mainly associated with typical LS, three of the patients in this report had an atypicalcourse of LS. There is no de ï¬nite genotype phenotype correlation. Electron transport chain studies were performed in six patients in whom either muscle or skin ï¬broblasts specimen available. The COX activity in each of these six patients was signi ï¬cantly decreased. Conclusions: To date, more than 100 patients of Leigh disease with SURF1 mutations have been reported.

Two MADB patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) were reported previously. Herein, we present an additional MADB patient with FSGS due to ZMPSTE24 mutations. Materials and Methods: The patient is 42 year old Japanese female. Her older sister had succumbed from diabetic nephropathy at age 41 years. Her clinical course was as follows: subcutaneous fat atrophy since childhood;proteinuria in her twenties; proteinuria with hypertension after delivering her son at age 31 years; diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver at 36 years; loss ofvisceral fat and renal dysfunction due to FSGS proven on kidney biopsy at 39 years, and kidney transplantation at 41 years. At age 42 years, she was referred for diagnostic workup. She showed a progeroid appearance with decreased subcutaneous fat. Radiographs revealed open cranial suture and thin clavicles. The study protocol was approved by theInstitutional Review Boards of Tokyo Women âs Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained. Results: Two rare heterozygous variants, p. Q41X and p. R412L in ZMPSTE24 , were detected. R412L, a novel var iant conserved over species, was not found in ExAC or 1000G, and was predicted to be pathogenic on PolyPhen2and Mutation T@ster. She has since received Metreleptin injections, achieving improvements of DM, liver dysfunc tion, and renal dysfunction. Conclusion: We reported a progeroid patient associated with FSGS caused by ZMPSTE24 mutations. Metreleptin was estimated to ameliorate renal function. M. Matsuo: None. N. Iwasaki: None. T.

The severity of clinical presentation depends on the underlying gene and can range from mild to life threatening condition with failure to thrive, hypotonia, metabolic acidosis, developmental delay, encephalopathy,pancreatitis, and chronic kidney disease. The common sign is increased methylmalonic acid plasma/urine level and hyperamonaemia. iMMA is genetically heterogeneous andcan be due to defects in genes involved in propionate pathway or cobalamin metabolism. The most common are MUT ,MMAA , and MMAB . Patients and Methods: Nine children were reported for genetic testing. Five patients were clinically diagnosed after manifestation before year 2013 and 4 patients were found inextended neonatal screening from blood spots that has been undertaken in Slovakia since 2013. Genes MUT andMMAA were sequenced using Sanger sequencing. One patient wasanalyzed using whole exome sequencing. Results: The diagnosis of iMMA was genetically con ï¬rmed in all tested patients. Six patients had bi allelic MMAA mutations (three different known pathogenic var iants and one novel variant p. A102T), two patients had bi allelic MUT mutations (two known pathogenic variants and one novel variant p. R93C) and one patient had a homo zygous known pathogenic MMAB variant. Conclusions: The neonatal screening from blood spots is an effective way for early pick up of individuals with iMMA. The most prevalent iMMA underlying gene in Slovakia is MMAA followed by MUT andMMAB , unlike reported in other countries, where the MUT gene is the most prevalent one.

Accurate molecular diagnosis can be challenging. We describe a proband, the third son of healthy consanguineous parents of Muslim Arab descent. He presented at six months with fatal, severe cardiogenic shock, dilated cardiomyo pathy, lactic acidosis and multiple mitochondrial respiratory complex de ï¬ciency. Materials and Methods: We performed trio whole exome sequencing (WES) and singelton mitochondrial genome sequencing. Results were ï¬ltered for rare, protein altering variants in genes related to mitochondrial function. Protein structures were modelled using SWISS MODEL based on the bovine crystal structure of mitochondrial Elongation Factor Tu/Ts complex (PDB #1XB2), andvisualized with UCSF Chimera software. Results: We identi ï¬ed a novel homozygous missense variant in TUFM (NM_003321.4): c.344A>C; p. His115Pro, encoding the mtDNA translation elongating factor Tu (EFTu). Pathogenic variants were not detected in mitochondrial DNA. This missense variant is located in domain 1 of the EFTu protein, which is required for GTP/GDP binding and for complex formation with elongation factor Ts (EFTs). Thishighly conserved His115 (GERP 5.42) is predicted to be an exposed and functional residue; therefore, substitution with a physiochemically different residue may disrupt properprotein folding, and may hamper Tu/Ts complex stability and EFTu reactivation. Conclusions: To date, only four patients with bi allelic TUFM mutations have been reported, all with severe early onset lactic acidosis and progressive infantile encephalo pathy without cardiomyopathy. We present a novel variantin a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis but without early encephalopathy, thus expanding the phe notype of TUFM related mitochondrial disease. T.

Moreover,reduction of mitochondrial respiratory complex I III was observed. The serious conditions led the patient to exitus at 24 months of age. Several molecular tests (panel genes forbrain calci ï¬cation, Aicardi GoutiÃ¨res syndrome, disorders of glycosylation, peroxisomal disease) and CGH array were normal. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identi ï¬ed two rare variants in KARS gene.

To date, mutations in KARS are associated with autosomal recessive Charcot Marie Tooth, non syndromic hearing loss, clinical features characterized by microcephaly,epilepsy, leukoencephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, visual impairment, auditory and hepatic failure and others with severe cardiomyopathy, psychomotor and mild delaymyopathy. Functional study on muscle biopsy of our patient revealed an alteration of protein expression. Our case shows once again how WES analysis is the ï¬rst level method in clinical practice in children with multi systemic, neurological and/or neuromuscular problems, mostly in case of mitochondrial disorders whose diagnosisis often problematic because of their large phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity.

Here we report the disease characteristics of a large cohort of pediatric MD patients ( n,95) with a deï¬nitive genetic diagnosis, giving special emphasis on clinical muscle involvement, biochemical and histopatho logical features. Of the whole cohort, 51 patients harbored mutations in nuclear DNA (nDNA) genes and 44 patientshad mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes. The nDNA patients were more likely to have a reduction in muscle ï¬ber succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) stains and in SDH positive blood vessels, while a higher frequency of mtDNA patients had ragged red (RRF) and blue ï¬bers. The presence of positive histopathological features was asso ciated with ophthalmoplegia, myopathic facies, weakness and exercise intolerance. In 17 patients younger than two years of age, RRF and blue ï¬bers were observed only in one case, six cases presented cytochrome c oxidase (COX) reduction/COX ï¬bers, SDH reduction was observed in ï¬ve and all except one presented SDH positive blood vessels.

However, mtDNA deletionsalso accumulate during aging, making their interpretation difï¬cult in patients suspected of mitochondrial diseases. The objective of this work was to identify criteria todistinguish normal aging vsmtDNA maintenance defects. Methods: MtDNA of patient muscles with known pathogenic variants in nuclear genes involved in mtDNAmaintenance (n ,34) and muscle from controls without mitochondrial enzyme and assembly defects (n ,53) were sequenced by next generation sequencing (NGS). Thesequencing data were processed through eKLIPse, a bioinformatic tool allowing the detection of mtDNA rear rangements. The deletions âproï¬les were compared between patients and controls according to age groups. Results: In the overall cohort, selected parameters such as location or number of deletions and heteroplasmy levelwere signi ï¬cantly different between patients and controls. However, the criteria for identifying mtDNA maintenance1346defects was depending on patient age: The number of deletions appearing to be signi ï¬cantly relevant only in the elderly, while in young subjects breakpoint repeat lengths surrounding the deletions were discriminant. Conclusion: EKLIPse analysis of mtDNA NGS allowed to discriminate age related mtDNA rearrangements fromthose related to mtDNA maintenance defects. These char acteristics are promising criteria in order to guide the molecular diagnosis towards mtDNA maintenance defectsand also to facilitate the prioritization of novel variants identi ï¬ed in nuclear encoded genes involved in mtDNA stability.

In the other patient, a mito chondrial DNA (mtDNA) mis sense mutation in MT ATP6 c.163A>G at m.8689 and a splice donor variant c.207 +2T>G (rs782792601) and two mis sense splice region variants: c.206A>G (rs781909386) and c.205A>G (rs782503581) in NDUFB11 were identi ï¬ed on the X chromosome. NDUFAF3 is a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (C1) assembly factor. mtDNA mutation m.8689 is asso ciated with mitochondrial complex V de ï¬ciency and Leigh syndrome while NDUFB11 is associated with mitochon drial C1 de ï¬ciency. The pathogenicity of these genes is in the process of being con ï¬rmed in patient ï¬broblasts. WES followed by functional validation of disease alleles could identify disease causative variants in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. J. Vella: None. S. Laurie: None. L. Matalonga: None.

A few cases of long surviving patients have been reported. Microcephaly, short stature, cognitive impairment and cardiomyopathy are variable features. Wepresent two females aged 26 and 31, further demonstrating long survival in MLASA 1.Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1347Materials and Methods: Patient 1 presented with myo pathy, lactacidosis and anemia at age 7, and MLASA 1 was suspected. Patient 2 presented with anemia at age 24. Severe exercise intolerance and myopathy since childhood was revealed. In both patients PUS1 was sequenced by Sanger/Next Generation Sequencing. Further clinicalinvestigations and cDNA analysis are ongoing. Results: In patient 1, compound heterozygosity for NM_025215.5( PUS1 ): c.431G>A p.(Arg144Gln) and c.441 +1G>A was detected. Patient 2 was shown to be homo zygous for c.441 +1G>A. This mutation is predicted to disrupt the donor splice site of intron 3, making aberrantsplicing likely. The missense variant c.431G>T p. (Arg144Gln) is located both at a highly conserved nucleo tide and amino acid. Both patients have high S lactate andchronic acidosis. Ringed sideroblasts were observed only once, in patient 1, but have otherwise not been demon strable in our patients. Conclusions: cDNA analysis might give further insights into the consequences of the identi ï¬ed mutations, possibly explaining the long survival. Classical sideroblastic anemiais not obvious in all MLASA patients, and the expressivity and age of presentation of symptoms are variable.

The disease is mainly caused by thedeï¬ciency of an enzyme named branched chained Î± keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD), which consist of four subunits, and encoded by BCKDHA,BCKDHB, DBT , and DLD gene respectively. Consanguinity increases the chance of the presence of pathogenic mutations in a homoallelic state. Bearing this on our minds, autozygosity mapping wasperformed with two sets of multiplex polymorphic STR (Short Tandem Repeat) markers linked to the above mentioned genes. The aim was to indirectly ï¬nd the probable mutated gene in the studied families. Then families who showed a homozygous haplotype for the STR markers ï¬anking gene/genes were subsequently sequenced. In this study, we also summarized our recent molecular genetics ï¬ndings to illustrate the mutation spectrum of MSUD in our country with high rate ofconsanguineous marriage (38.4%). Eleven novel mutations and some recently reported mutations were identi ï¬ed. We found that BCKDHB mutation is the most common mutatedgene in our study which is different from other reports in other parts of the world. Additionally, structural modelling of MSUD mutations has been analyzed to predict thepathogenicity of the newly identi ï¬ed variants. Identi ï¬cation of these mutations will further expand the spectrum of known gene mutations and contributes to the genotype phenotype correlation and is very important in prenatal molecular diagnosis of MSUD at risk families.

We analysed patients with maternally inherited multisystem MD due to mutations in mtDNA encodedsubunits (MT ND genes) of complex I diagnosed in our department. Material: In the cohort of 106 unrelated families with mtDNA mutations, mutations in MT ND genes were found in 13 patients from 12 families. Results: Among 13 patients, 8 different heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations in MT ND1 (2x), MT ND3 (1x) and MT ND5 (5x) genes were found. In patient with childhood onset of migraines followed by stroke like episodes later inadulthood, novel heteroplasmic mutation m.13091T>C in MT ND5 was found. Six patients with heteroplasmy levels >60% developed Leigh syndrome and their prognosis wassigniï¬cantly worse compared to ï¬ve patients with hetero plasmy levels <60%. MELAS syndrome including stroke like episodes was observed in these ï¬ve patients. In two children, the diseases started with optic neuropathy mimicking LHON syndrome, later it transitioned to multi system diseases compatible with MELAS syndrome. CIactivities in muscle mitochondria were decreased in most patients and mitochondrial energy generating capacity was altered in some patients. Conclusions: Patients with multisystem MD due to mutations in mtDNA encoded subunits of complex I usually develop Leigh or MELAS syndromes and represent11% of families with maternally inherited MD diagnosed in our centre. Early onset of the disease and higher mtDNA mutation heteroplasmy levels are accompanied with Leighphenotype and worse prognosis.

In Romania, the prevalence ofobesity is increasing and it is more common in male. The aim of this study is to identify the genes involved in the predisposition and pathogenesis of obesity. 3 allelic variantsof genes related to this condition were analysed: rs11030104 of BDNF gene, LY86 gene rs2199936 poly morphism and rs2199936 of ABCG2 gene. Methods: This study consists of 5281 male patients hospitalized between 2012 and 2017 in multiple clinics in Bucharest for various medical reasons. All subjects were ofselfâreported European descent. No signi ï¬cant difference was observed between the average age of the cases (66.9) and controls (64.3). DNA was extracted from whole bloodat deCODE Genetics (Reykjavik, Iceland) and genotyped, using In ï¬nium OmniExpress â24 bead chips (Illumina). A total of 716 503 SNPs were genotyped for each individualincluded in the study. Results: The BDNF rs11030104 polymorphism has shown statistical correlation for obesity alike with theworldwide rates (p ,0.0004642). Another statistical corre lation between obesity and the rs1294410 LY86 variant, responsible for the waist to hip ratio variation, was identi ï¬ed (p,0.003984). ABCG2 rs2199936, which is involved in the serum uric acid adjustment, has also shown statistical correlation for obesity (p ,0.003733; OR ,0.4707).

It is often associated with cardiometaboliccomorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. However, some individuals remain cardiometabo lically healthy despite being obese, also called themetabolically healthy obese (MHO). The biological mechanisms that underlie MHO are poorly understood. To identify novel adiposity increasing variants with protectivecardiometabolic effects, we performed pairwise analyses of adiposity and cardiometabolic traits using available sum mary statistics from 11 GWAS. These include threeadiposity traits (body fat percentage, body mass index, and waist to hip ratio) and eight cardiometabolic traits (high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipopro tein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin, blood pressure, and incident coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes). We identi ï¬ed genome wide signi ï¬cant associations (P<5x10 8) with any of the 24 trait pairs consisting of one of three adiposity traits and one of the eight cardiometabolic traits.

OTC de ï¬ciency can occur as a severe neonatal onset disease in males and as a post neonatal onset (partial deï¬ciency) disease in females. Materials and Methods: We present family with 4 years old girl who has clinical symptoms of urea cycle disorders. Another members of family are healthy. Proband âs perinatal period was normal. Since the ï¬rst year she refused to eat meat product. At age of 3 years she was detected liver transaminase elevated (more than 10 norm) with neurolo gical symptoms. Orotic acid concentration in urine was normal. A low protein diet was effective: a liver transami nase normalized, neurological symptoms stopped. Results: Analysis of whole exome sequencing data revealed a pathogenic heterozygous variant c.78 1G>A in OTC gene in the proband. This variant was con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing in proband, wasn ât detected in her mother and her healthy older sister, and was detected in her father in heterozygous state in mosaic form. In her father wedetected only one copy of X chromosome by different methods, including cytogenetic. We detected mosaicism of variant c.78 1G>A in OTC gene in the different tissues(buccal epithelium, blood, seminal ï¬uid, urinary sediment) which are having an origin from every germ layer (ecto derm, mesoderm, endoderm).

In the present study, weaimed to investigate the germline genetic burden in genes affecting mitochondrial function and the role of the subsequent genetic variability in PD. For this reason, wecompared the genetic variability in 70 patients with early onset or familial PD without a discovered monogenic cause with that of 253 controls. Mitochondrial genome wasreconstructed from clinical or whole exome sequencing data, which allowed us to investigate both mitochondrial as well as nuclear genes, including nuclear genes involved inhuman mitochondrial disorders. For further analysis, variants were ï¬ltered excluding nuclear variants based on in house populational data, those with mean allelefrequency over 5% in public databases and synonymous mitochondrial variants. We detected signi ï¬cant differences in burden of variants in three mitochondrially encodedgenes. The greatest increase of variant burden between PD and controls was observed in MTND5 (38.6% versus 26.9%), MTCO2 (10.5% versus 5.5%) and MTND4L (7%versus 0.5%), with the ï¬rst and last being mitochondrial respiratory complex I components.

Rapid mtDNA analysis is not routinely available, particularly in centres performing ES, which does not deliver clinical grade mtDNA sequencing. We describe our experience using rapid mtDNA sequencing in tandem with an ES based rapid genomic diagnosis program as part of the Australian Genomics Acute Careï¬agship. Methods: Two infants presenting with persistent lactic acidosis and bone marrow failure were recruited for rapidgenomic testing. With clinical suspicion of mitochondrial disease, both infants underwent rapid ES and mtDNA sequencing in tandem, the latter using Nextera librariesfrom a full length mtDNA amplicon. Results: ES was non diagnostic in both infants. mtDNA sequencing identi ï¬ed a single large mtDNA deletion in both infants, diagnostic of Pearson syndrome (MIM 557000). Diagnostic reports were issued within 73 hours 55 minutes and 54 hours 25 minutes, respectively. Both infants avoidedinvasive bone marrow biopsies and a range of other investigations. Conclusions: Rapid mtDNA sequencing in tandem with ES results in additional diagnoses in seriously ill children with suspected mitochondrial pathology, suggesting that ES alone may be insuf ï¬cient in this setting. When designing rapid genomic diagnosis programs, centres should consider incorporating mtDNA ampli ï¬cation and analysis in indivi duals with suspected mitochondrial pathology, by combin ing ES and mtDNA sequencing in tandem, or analysing mtDNA data from GS, which captures the mitochondrial genome.

The misfolded nature of most of the disease causing mutations makes the use of stabilizing molecules, pharmacological chaperones (PCs) orproteostasis regulators (PRs), a promising therapeutic strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PRs on the stability and activity of PMM2 unstablemutants and decipher their molecular mechanisms. Materials and Methods: Patient derived ï¬broblasts transduced with their own PMM2 folding or oligomeriza tion mutation were treated with different concentrations of PRs (celastrol and MG 132) or combining celastrol and a PC (CVIII). Their effect was studied by western blot andPMM enzymatic assay. The expression levels of several molecular chaperones (HSPs) were assessed by qRT PCR and western blot. The speci ï¬city of the molecular chaper ones involved was evaluated by using speci ï¬c HSP70 or HSP90 inhibitors. Results: Celastrol treatment signi ï¬cantly increases PMM2 protein levels and activity of various mutants in the cellular model. These results correlate with an increment in the transcriptional and proteomic levels of some HSPs of the proteostasis network. The HSP90 inhibitor, but not the HSP70 one, interferes with the effect of celastrol on PMM2.The combination of celastrol and CVIII has a mutation dependent synergistic effect on PMM2 activity. Conclusions: These results show the positive effect of celastrol on the PMM2 stability and activity through the HSP90 driven modulation of the proteostasis network. This is a proof of concept of the possible therapeutic use of PRsand PCs for PMM2 CDG. D. Gallego: None. A. Vilas: None. P. Yuste: None. L. R. Desviat: None. M. Ugarte: None. C. PÃ©rez CerdÃ¡: None.

Bi allelic pathogenic variants in PNPT1 have been identi ï¬ed in patients with a hetero geneous phenotype ranging from non syndromic deafness to a multisystemic presentation with severe global devel opmental delay, seizures, dystonia, choreoathetosis,ophthalmological abnormalities and different MRI ï¬ndings. Materials and Methods: We investigated 5 unrelated patients with bi allelic variants in PNPT1 identi ï¬ed through massively parallel sequencing. The patients presented with clinical features in common with previously reported mul tisystemic cases. Using patient ï¬broblasts and peripheral blood samples, we performed functional studies to con ï¬rm pathogenicity including cDNA studies, complex I (CI) and IV (CIV) enzyme activity assays, immunoblotting, RT qPCR analysis for detection of mitochondrial unprocessed transcripts, and expression of targeted interferon signalling genes. Results: Compared to controls, patient ï¬broblasts showed mildly reduced CI and CIV protein activities, there was also a reduction in PNPT1 protein expression and a 2 6 foldaccumulation of MT ND5 +MT ND6 and MT CYTB +MT ND6 mitochondrial RNA unprocessed transcripts. In blood, there was an increased expression of 6 genes involved in theinterferon I pathway. Conclusions: The accumulation of mitochondrial unprocessed transcripts and increased interferon pathwayexpression provides further evidence for the role of PNPT1 in mitochondrial RNA processing, and of the possible contribution of an immune response to disease pathogen esis. It also demonstrates that in order to con ï¬rm patho genicity, functional analyses of the primarily affected processes are more sensitive than the modest defectsdetected downstream on the respiratory chain enzyme activities.

Combined respiratory chain (RC) complexes defects are caused by mutations in the mtDNA encoded RNA products and mutations in nucleargenes involved in mtDNA translation machinery. PUS1 ,a nuclear gene, encodes for cytoplasmatic and mitochondrial tRNA pseudouridine synthase 1, that converts uridine intopseudouridine in several tRNA positions increasing the efï¬ciency of protein synthesis on both compartments. Mutations in PUS1 cause MLASA syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of oxidative phosphorylation and iron metabolism, clinically characterized by Mitochon drial Myopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Sideroblastic Anemia. We report clinical, biochemical and molecular ï¬ndings of unreported patient in which Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) revealed the presence of new biallelic mutations inPUS1 . Review of the 16 PUS1 mutant patients published to date demonstrates a huge clinical heterogeneity with intellectual disability, microcephaly and anemia as typicalclinical elements. Given the paucity of the patients described, it is not possible to delineate a complete phenotypic picture and the associated clinical evolution,and it is not possible to establish an accurate genotype phenotype correlation that allows us to indicate a proper prognosis and follow up. Moreover, our patient had severeosteoporosis with multiple fractures that were never previously reported in the literature and a more early evolution of neuro muscular symptoms than the otherpatients.

Only three cases of SCO1 mutations have thus far been reported. All cases presented with lactate acidosis and encephalopathy. Twohad hepatopathy and hypotonia. One further presented with intrauterine growth retardation and hypertrophic cardiomyo pathy leading to cardiac failure. Here we present a case of a girl of Afghan con sanguineous parents, born premature with a novel homo zygous mutation in the SCO1 gene and a different phenotype than previously reported cases. Within the ï¬rst two hours, the girl developed severe lactate acidosis and hypoglycemia. Echocardiography, eyeexamination, ultrasound of the brain, kidneys and urinary tract were normal. As was the level of ammonium. At four days old an investigation of suspected metabolic diseasewas initiated including whole exome sequencing. Merely ï¬ve days later whole exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the SCO1 gene (c.317_319del GAG) in exon 2 resulting in an in frame deletion of Gly106. A muscle biopsy was later performed, showing reduced activity of complex IV in accordance with the SCO1 mutation detected by whole exome sequencing. The girl died 1 month old. Conclusion: We identi ï¬ed a novel homozygous SCO1 mutation (Gly106del) in a patient with a clinical course of mitochondrial disease different from previously reported SCO1 cases. Mitochondrial disease may manifest in neo nates, but early diagnosis has so far been dif ï¬cult. Because of improved technique as whole exome sequencing early diagnosis and consideration of treatment level are nowpossible. N. Brix: None. J. M. Jensen: None. I. S. Pedersen: None. A. Ernst: None.

Each human cell contains several mitochondria which hold multiple copies of mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA). mtDNA heteroplasmy is the coexisting of wild type and mutant mtDNA molecules in a cell. The proportion of mutated mtDNA should exceed a threshold to causebiochemical defects. NGS leaded us to identify an increasing number of pathogenic variants but also of variant of unknown signi ï¬cance (VUS).Only a tiny sub group of VUS was functionally evaluated with certitude, while the pathogenicity of the great majority was only assessed in silico. We investigated seven patients with clinical features,muscle biopsy and biochemical defects suggesting a mitochondrial dysfunction, including the presence of cytochrome c oxidase de ï¬cient ï¬bers (COX ( )). mtDNA sequencing found a VUS for each patient. In order to determine the pathogenicity of these VUS, we quanti ï¬ed the level of mtDNA heteroplasmy by semi quantitative ï¬uor escent PCR in muscle ï¬bres COX ( +) and COX ( ) single cells. We found a statistically signi ï¬cant heteroplasmic difference between individual COX ( +) and COX ( ) cells for 6 patients, which supports the pathogenicity of these VUS, allowing us to con ï¬rm the diagnosis for these patients. Determining the pathogenicity of the VUSidenti ï¬ed by NGS is becoming a major goal to reduce diagnostic wandering in patients. The single cell hetero plasmy quanti ï¬cation is a gold standard method for the mutation disease causal link assessment and should be used routinely in diagnosis.

Homozygous or compound heterozygousmutations of TANGO2 gene lead to the disease Metabolic encephalomyopathic crises, recurrent, with rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurodegeneration. Symptomsinclude recurrent metabolic crises associated with encepha lopathy, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias and1356laboratory ï¬ndings such as hypoglycaemia, hyperammone mia, lactic acidosis and elevated CK levels. With the progression of the disease epilepsy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, global brain atrophy and pyramidal signs appear. Materials and Methods: We report a 4 year old child with developmental delay. From 21 months of age he showed episodes of suddenly onset hypotonia, gait instability, ataxia, and distortion of the head and upperbody. During these paroxysm plasma creatinine kinase and lactate was elevated. He has seizures from 2 years of age: grand mal and spasms also occurred. He hashypothyreoidism. Results: A pathogenic apparently homozygous TANGO2:c.385C>T variant was identi ï¬ed in exon 4 of the TANGO2 gene by Whole Exome Sequencing. We exam ined the parents for the above mentioned variant, but we could only detect the variant in the mother.

Phenotypic spectrum of TSD is diverse and differs between infantile and adult form. No effective treatment for TSD is available and genetic counselling (DNA analysis) is thus importantfor prenatal diagnosis. Our cohort includes 14 patients with adult form of TSD (surprisingly twice more than infantile form) diagnosed in the Czech Republic between 2002 and2018 yielding an estimated birth prevalence of 1:325,000. Median age of ï¬rst symptoms and of diagnosis were 21years and 35 years, respectively. The main clinical symptoms were problems with mild dysarthria, rapid speech, proximal weakness of lower extremities, balance disturbances and/or psychiatric disorders. Cerebellar atro phy in brain MRI was a constant feature. Leukocyte hexosaminidaseA activity was decreased to 1.8 4.1% ofcontrols. All patients carried at least one allele with the mild variant p. Gly269Ser; a novel variant p. Arg252Cys was detected in one family. Adult form of TSD seems to be anunderdiagnosed although an enzyme assay in serum/plasma is a fast, inexpensive and reliable tool to detect patients with this form of TSD and genetic con ï¬rmation is routine.

We investigate:Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) of T2D in Qataris, genetically Determined Metabotypes (GDM) of T2D and gene metabolic networks. Polygenic risk scores highlight therole of genetics in early diagnosis, compared to other risk factors. Identifying gene metabolite associations is impor tant for understanding the genetic factors affecting meta bolic pathways. 1000 Qatari samples (57% T2D), with whole exome sequence and genotype array data were used. All samples were pro ï¬led for more than 1000 metabolites. We constructed a PRS using those SNPs that replicated from 81 published loci, in the array data, and computed the accuracy of PRS in individuals with whole exome data. Fordetermining GDMs in T2D, we ï¬rst identi ï¬ed metabolites signiï¬cantly associated with T2D, and then the associations of those metabolites with 1.6 million common variants.

Also, metabolicsignatures were generated for risk strati ï¬cation and tracking the health of the individuals. Materials and Methods: NMR metabolomics was used to quantify 228 metabolic measures in 11,896 individuals from four Finnish cohorts (mean age 35 years, range 24 45). Results: Associations between baseline metabolites and diabetes onset during the 7 15 years of follow up (392 incident cases) were assessed by logistic regression. Alto gether 113 metabolites were associated with incident dia betes (P<0.0009; range of odds ratios (OR) per 1 SD: 0.59 1.50) after adjusting for sex, baseline age, glucose and BMI. Among the strongest predictors of increased risk of diabeteswere higher concentrations of branched chained and aro matic amino acids (OR: 1.33), triglycerides in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL; OR 1.50), and lower levels ofomega 6 fatty acids (OR 0.75). A biomarker signature comprised of phenylalanine, free cholesterol in large HDL, and the ratio of cholesteryl esters to total lipids in largeVLDL was predictive of incident diabetes in an independent validation cohort after adjusting for baseline glucose and BMI (OR 10.1 comparing 5th vs 1st quintile of the bio marker score). Conclusions: Individuals at risk for T2D display a dis tinct metabolic signature even years before the diseasedevelops. Using the signature, both early risk strati ï¬cation and personalised follow up of the disease progression is enabled. High throughput metabolomics therefore providesa powerful tool for population wide diabetes prevention and control programs. Metabolomics is already used for health tracking in Finland. J.

Jovanovic1, A. Maver2, A. Hodzic2, B. Peterlin2, O. Miljanovic1 1Centre for Medical Genetics and Immunology, Podgorica, Montenegro,2University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a rare, fatal, autosomal, recessive inheritable disease that occurs as a consequence of mutations in one of the 14 PEX familial genes. ZS represents the absence of peroxisomes resultingin damaging metabolic pathways, especially beta oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. ZS is characterized by facial dysmorphia, neurological disorders and gradual insuf ï¬ ciency of all vital organs. In the second half of pregnancy the ventriculomegaly appearance is possible and endocra nium MRI could detect characteristical ZS changes:abnormal gyral forms, disturbed myelination and cerebral periventricular pseudocysts. The aim is to use the case report on a ZS patient to point out the possibility of recognising a rare inheritable disease expected with a frequency of one in 50,000 live births. Results: The infant with dysmorphia, hypotonia, hyper bilirubinaemia, and hepatomegaly is presented. In 13th week of gestation the enlarged nuchal region cystic hygroma and the border ventriculomegaly were found byultrasound examination. Pre natal diagnosis excluded chromosomal aberrations and pregnancy was continued and completed by birth in term. Severe hypotonia and dys morphia were present at birth. In the further course a jaundice, rise in liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase, development of hepatic insuf ï¬ciency, and multiorganic failure have occurred with a lethal outcome in the ï¬fth month of life. A clinical exome sequencing (NGS) identi ï¬ed the homozygous mutation in the PEX6 gene, described as pathogenic causative to ZS. Conclusion: Considering the characteristics of ZS, set ting up a suspicion and conducting prenatal diagnosing forZS are crucial in preventing this syndrome among liveborns. J. Jovanovic: None. A.

Understanding the biological mechanisms underpinning susceptibility to infection and development of chronic disease may inform future pre ventative and therapeutic strategies. Materials and Methods: Using a rigorously validated Multiplex Serology platform, we sought to identify humangenetic variation associated with differential response to infectious agents. We undertook genetic association analy sis of antibody responses measured against 45 antigenstargeting 20 infectious agents implicated in chronic disease pathogenesis (including human herpes and papilloma viruses, and Helicobacter pylori ) using baseline serum samples from 9,611 individuals selected at random from the UK Biobank. Results: We identi ï¬ed 2853 non HLA regions associated with antibody responses to our selected pathogens ( p< 1x10 5), 13 of which contained peaks reaching genome wide signi ï¬cance (p < 5x10 8). Some of these association signals validate candidate mechanisms of infection activity whereas others implicate other plausible yet previously unrecognised molecular pathways. Associations wereobserved within the extended MHC region for at least one antigen from each of the 20 pathogens. Of the non MHCAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1359associations, we identi ï¬ed three regions associated with more than one pathogen. These regions span NFKB1 on chromosome 4, the IGH region on chromosome 14, and FUT2 on chromosome 19. Conclusions: Theï¬ndings and approaches used in this work and future ambitions to apply the Multiplex Serologyplatform to the entire UK Biobank cohort are likely to improve our understanding of infection disease associations and molecular mechanisms facilitating therapeutic dis covery and precision medicine.

Our objective was to investigate whether the TNF, IL1B , IL6 genes polymorphisms have in ï¬uence on BPD susceptibility. Materials and Methods: The study included 351 neo nates with gestation period less than 32 weeks. GenotypingofIL1B 511 G/A ,IL6 174 G/C andTNF 308 G/A variants was performed by Real time PCR. The statistical differ ences in genotypes distribution among the groups werecompared using the chi square or Fisher exact test. Results: BPD was present in 36 neonates (11.43%). There were no signi ï¬cant differences in the genotypes distribution and allele frequencies for the IL1B and IL6 genes variants between neonates with and without BPD. The frequencies of TNF genotypes were GG 55.6%, GA 38.9% and AA 5.6% in neonates with BPD and GG 79.7%, GA 19.7% and AA 0.6% in neonates without BPD. TNF genotypes frequencies between these groups were statisti cally signi ï¬cantly different (p ,0.001). Also, statistically signiï¬cant difference was observed in TNF genotypesdistribution between neonates with BPD and without BPD by dominant model (GG vs. GA/AA) (p ,0.001; RR,2.188, 95% CI 1.428 3.348; OR ,3.138, 95% CI 1.539 6.397). After the adjustment for BMW, gestational age, and sepsis, logistic regression con ï¬rmed statistically signiï¬cant association between TNF 308G/A genotypes and development of BPD in premature infants (B , 0.992, p,0.003). TNF 308 A allele is risk factor for BPD (p,0.0007). Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings suggest that TNF 308 A allele is a risk factor for development of BPD in premature neo nates under the 32 weeks. T. M.

Materials and Methods: A cohort of 150 clinically well characterised C1 INH HAE patients from 75 unrelated families from Croatia, Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, andSlovenia was recruited for genetic analysis, which included sequencing and MLPA analysis of SERPING1 , as well as detection of F12 (rs1801020) and KLKB1 (rs3733402) variants. Results: We have identi ï¬ed 39 different mutations (14 missense, 11 nonsense, 7 frameshift, 1 in frame deletion,2 splicing defects, 1 substitution affecting the promoter, 3 large indels). Thirteen mutations have not been previously1360described. When addressing the genotype phenotype rela tionship we found that patients with nonsense and frame shift mutations, large indels, splicing defects, and mutations affecting the C1 INH active site (at Arg444) exhibited an increased clinical severity score, compared with those with missense mutations, excluding mutations at Arg444.Importantly, the F12 variant was associated with disease onset. No association between KLKB1 variant and disease expression was identi ï¬ed. Conclusions: Our study identi ï¬ed 39 different, among them 13 novel, disease causing mutations in C1 INH HAE patients, highlighting the heterogeneity of mutations in theSERPING1 gene. The mutations with a clear effect on C1 INH function predispose patients to a more severe disease phenotype and the CC F12 variant to earlier disease onset. M. Rijavec: None. M. Ko Å¡nik: None. M.

The SNP is located between IL2 and IL21 genes, which encodefor immune IL 2 and IL 21 cytokines, respectively, and have been proposed as candidate etiological genes for CeD, although functionally con ï¬rmation is still pending. Thus, the main aim of this study was to analyze the effect of rs6822844 in intestinal cells. For that purpose, the genomic region surrounding rs6822844 was mutated in HCT116epithelial intestinal cells using CRISPR Cas9, and mRNA levels of IL2, IL21 and FGF2 were analyzed. The CRISPR Cas9 edition produced a complex reorganization of thegenomic region, and provoked a downregulation of FGF2 expression located 240kb downstream of the SNP. On the contrary, FGF2 expression was upregulated in intestinalbiopsies from CeD patients. In addition, U937 monocytes were incubated in edited and non edited HCT116 condi tioned media and ILB1 expression was measured toevaluate their activation. Proliferation assays were also performed in both HCT116 and U937 cells. Monocytesincubated in conditioned medium from edited HCT116 cells showed lower activation and slower proliferation than those incubated in medium conditioned by wild type HTC116 cells. Unlike, edited HCT116 cells presented a higher proliferation rate compared to wild type cells. In conclusion, disruption of the rs6822844 region provokes alterations inintestinal cells that seem to affect monocytes and in turn the inï¬ammatory status, suggesting the presence of genomic elements within the region that could contribute to thedevelopment of celiac disease.

Materials and Methods: We determined the total cfDNA concentration and relative content of telomeric sequences in plasma cfDNA in recent celiac disease patients(rCD, n ,10) and healthy age matched controls (HC, n , 10) by qPCR. To document that the observed biological effects are caused by cfDNA molecules, we treated thepaired plasma samples with DNase. Using paired samples of plasma (non treated and treated by DNase), we analyzed the contribution of cfDNA to the activation of TLR9 andTNF Î±mRNA expression in THP1 monocytic cell line. Results: We found neither signi ï¬cant differences in the quantity of cfDNA nor in the relative amount of telomeresequences in the non treated rCD and HC plasma. Stimu lation of THP1 cells with non treated rCD plasma led to higher mRNA expression level TNF Î±(p,0.031) than sti mulation with non treated HC plasma.

30403,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a disease resulting in extreme fatigue without any known underlying medicalcondition. CFS often presents in patients following a viral infection and patients may appear to have slightly impaired immune systems. With no positive diagnostic, CFS is oftenmisunderstood and misdiagnosed. A pilot clinical study was established to give further insight into the immunological role of CFS. This pilot study included 15 CFS patients and15 age and sex matched controls undergoing cardiopul monary exercise testing (CPET). Blood was extracted at four time points immediately before, 1 day after, 2 daysafter and 3 days after. Five immune cell types were sorted from whole blood collected from each participant, and RNA was extracted and sequenced for each cell type, as well aswhole blood, at each time point. Additionally, each participant underwent extensive clinical surveys and questionnaires. Our team has employed machine learning approaches to construct classi ï¬ers that can accurately distinguish CFS from non disease states in immune cells using RNA Seqdata. This technique has generated non linear gene asso ciations that can be used to understand distinct gene expression differences between disease and non diseasestates. We were able to identify B cell classi ï¬ers as being the highest performing classi ï¬ers in the immune cell populations, suggesting B cells contain more interesting disease state biology. Gene signatures from these classi ï¬ers were further found to be enriched in co expression modules associated with B cell maturation. These classi ï¬er algo rithms can also be used to predict unseen observations as a future diagnostic tool. P. Comella: None. N. Beckmann: None. G. Hoffman: None. E. Schadt: A.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), possessing antiangiogenic properties and microRNAs (miRNAs), implicated in governing angiogenesis, bothseem vital in this process. In this study, we aimed to investigate how TKI treatment affects angiogenesis related miRNAs expression and angiogenic factors concentration inplasma of CML patients. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood plasma sam ples were obtained from CML patients at the diagnosis(n,23) and during TKI treatment (n ,12). Quantitative assessment of the expression of miRNA 126 3p, miRNA 150 5p and miRNA 21 3p was performed with qRT PCR. Concentrations of selected angiogenic factors in plasma (Angiogenin, bFGF, Endostatin,aFGF, PDGF AA, PIGF, Thrombospondin 2, VEGF D, Angiopoietin 1, VEGF)were assessed using multiplex ï¬uorescent bead based immunoassays (Luminex Corporation). Results: MiRNA 150 5p and miRNA 21 3p expression was evidently higher in the treatment group (p ,0,001 and p,0,03, respectively). PDGF AA concentration in newly diagnosed patients with CML was higher than in alreadytreated patients (942,84 pg/ml vs 512,5 pg/ml, p ,0,02), similarly to VEGF (262,82 pg/ml vs 27 pg/ml, p ,0,03). Conclusions: TKI treatment affects miRNAs expression and angiogenic factors concentration in plasma of CML patients. MiRNAs could serve as biomarkers in monitoring CML progression and drug response, however, their exactrole in CML related angiogenesis remains to be further elucidated.1362Funding: This work was supported by Pomeranian Medical University Young Investigator Grant MB 173 218/ 17.

They arise from mutations in the beta globin gene HBB and the only curative treatment is an allogenichematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is complicated by limited matching donor availability, severe adverse reac tions and excessive costs. Hemoglobinopathy symptomscan also be ameliorated with the increase of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), but pharmacological treatments are sub optimal. However, naturally occurring bene ï¬cial altera tions can lead to elevated levels of HbF in adulthood. When these benign Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HPFH) syndrome alterations are coinherited with a beta hemoglobinopathy the disease can be much milder or even symptomless. Several HPFH alterations have been identi ï¬ed. Gene therapy and gene editing tools such as ZFNs, and CRISPR/Cas9 hold much promise for the treatment of genetic diseases and have been studied also for the treatment of beta hemoglobinopathies. The ï¬rst CRISPR/ Cas9 clinical trials are also underway. Here, we have used the CRISPR/Cas9 based genetic engineering as well as single base editing to produce bene ï¬cial HPFH mutations to hematopoietic cell lines, control and SCD patient hemato poietic CD34 +cells in vitro . After genetic editing and differentiation to hemoglobin producing red blood cells,the cells show up to 35% production of fetal Hb. The differentiation capacity and the genetic pro ï¬le of the cells show no signi ï¬cant changes. Funding: Academy of Finland, grants 308481, 286773S. Jalil: None. Y. Novik: None. R.

Methods: We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) on 16 circulating in ï¬ammatory phenotypes in Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966,N,5,284). A subsequent meta analysis was completed for 10 phenotypes available in a previous GWAS [1] adding up to 13,577 individuals in the study. Complementary asso ciation tests were performed to study the effect of the ABO blood types on soluble adhesion molecule levels. Results: We identi ï¬ed seven novel and six previously reported genetic associations (p<3.1x10 9). We observed three loci associating with soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM 1) level, one of which is the ABO locus that has been previously associated with soluble E selectin (sE selectin) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM 1) levels [2 4]. Our ï¬ndings further suggest that the blood type B associates primarily with the concentration of sVCAM 1 while the A1 subtype shows a robust effect on sE selectin and sICAM 1 levels. The genotypes in the ABO locus associating with higher soluble adhesion molecule levels tend to associate with lower circulating cholesterol levels and lower cardiovascular disease risk. Conclusions: The present results extend the knowledge about genetic factors contributing to the in ï¬ammatory load. Ourï¬ndings suggest that two distinct mechanisms con tribute to the soluble adhesion molecule levels at the ABO locus and that increased soluble adhesion molecule levels by itself may not increase risk for cardiovascular disease.

Just like the HIES, these mutations cause elevated serum IgE, eosinophilia, frequent staphylo coccal infections. Patients have increased risk for infectionsas well as autoimmunity and malignancy. DOCK8 gene spans 48 exons and deletions are the most common type of mutations. Here, we present 2 primary immune de ï¬ciency patients who are clinically diagnosed as DOCK8 de ï¬ciency. Both of the patients have consanguineous parents and laboratory results indicating DOCK8 de ï¬ciency. Ion AmpliSeq â¢Primary Immune De ï¬ciency Research Panel designed for sequencing 264 primary immune de ï¬ciency genes were used for mutation detection. After initialanalysis of 264 genes ï¬ltering through minor allele frequency, variant location and variant effect no causative mutation was detected. Immune gene panel rechecked inboth cases due to the strong clinical ï¬ndings and large deletions were detected in both patients.

Despite the signi ï¬cant improvement of intensive neonatal care it is the mostfrequent cause of morbidity and mortality among preterm infants. Interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), is a proin ï¬ammatory mediator that appears very early in response to infection. The polymorphism 511 G/A inIL1B gene is located upstream of the transcriptional start site and in ï¬uences its transcriptional activity. The aim of this study was toevaluate the relationships between rs16944 polymorphism inIL1B ( 511 G/A) and susceptibility and outcome of early onset sepsis (EOS) in preterm infants. Material and Methods: Our study included 471 preterm infants, 285 with EOS and 186 healthy premature infants. For all patients data about gender, gestational age, weighton birth (BMW), Apgar score determined in the 5th minute (AS5 â), type of delivery and multiple pregnancies are col lected. IL1B 511G/A genotypes were detected with custom real time genotyping assay. Results: Frequency of AA IL1B 511G/A genotype is statistically signi ï¬cantly higher in EOS group (p ,0.028). Genotype frequencies between EOS and control groups by recessive (GG +GA/AA) model also show signi ï¬cant dif ferences (p ,0.012). Logistic regression with weight on birth and gestational age as covariates con ï¬rmed signi ï¬cant association between IL1B 511 G/A genotypes and devel opment of sepsis (B , 0.427, p ,0.000). Also, in the EOS group AA genotype was signi ï¬cant predictor of lethal outcome (p ,0.033).

It is the cause of infectious mononucleosis and has oncogenic potential. Little is known about the potential impact of human geneticvariation on inter individual differences in response to EBV. The challenge of genetic determinant discovery explaining host susceptibility and response to EBVinfection is compounded by pathogen genetic variation. We here use a genome to genome (G2G) strategy to search for genetic associations between paired human and EBVsamples, which could highlight sites of host pathogen genomic con ï¬icts and shed light on pathogenesis. We obtained and curated human genome wide genotyp ing data and consensus EBV genome sequencing data from 266 HIV infected individuals with elevated EBV plasma viral load (>2000 copies/ml). We performed a separategenome wide association study (GWAS) for each viral variant using generalized linear mixed models, while con trolling for human and EBV population structure. We performed a total of 850 GWASs. No host pathogen association survived the Bonferroni corrected G2G sig niï¬cance threshold of 10 11. We observed four signals with P<10 8, including an association between variants in the EBV gene BFRF1 and in the human gene RSRC1 , which functions in spliceosome assembly and participates inmultiple steps of mRNA splicing. Because EBV depends on host proteins for viral gene expression, changes in alter native splicing due to RSRC1 variation could in ï¬uence EBV pathogenesis by selecting speci ï¬c BFRF1 escape mutations. The joint analysis of host and pathogen genetic variation can help uncover novel genetic in ï¬uences on infectious diseases. S. RÃ¼eger: None. C. Hammer: A.

The age of onset of FMF varies, with about 60% and 90% of patients experiencing their ï¬rst attack before the age of 10 and 20 years, respectively. Hence, FMF with the ï¬rst attack occurring at the age of â¥40 years (i.e. late onset FMF) is rare and only a few small studies haveaddressed this disease subset. Objectives: This work aimed at investigating the mole cular genetic characteristics of Armenian patients diagnosedwith late onset FMF. Methods: Genomic DNA isolated from 354 Armenian late onset FMF patients were analysed for the 12 mostcommon MEFV mutations plus SAA1 isoforms 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5 using multiplex PCR and reverse hybridisation. Muta tional spectra and resulting genotypes were then matchedagainst the clinico demographic pro ï¬les collected for these patients. Results: Of all 354 patients, 194 (54.80%) were female and 160 (45.20%) were male. The following genotypes were signiï¬cantly associated with the late onset variant: M680I/E148Q (P ,0.004), M694V/E148Q (P<0.001) and V726A/ V726A (P ,0.001). Of note, 12/354 (3.39%) patients were found to be homozygous for the M694V mutation. Conclusions: Our data suggest that late onset FMF is more prevalent in women and is of greater genetic diversity than previously reported. Further studies including late onset FMF patients homozygous for MEFV mutation M694V are ongoing and may lead to the identi ï¬cation of novel disease modifying mechanisms. G. KriegshÃ¤user: None. H.

Autosomal recessive mutations in IL36RN have been identi ï¬ed in 16 30% of patients with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a rare, severe pustular psoriasis accompanied by multi systemic in ï¬ammation. These muta tions increase pro in ï¬ammatory signaling in the IL 36 pathway. In exome sequences of 25 independent patients negative for IL36RN , we identi ï¬ed 2 patients with the1366identical heterozygous frameshift variant in SERPINA3 .W e next sequenced the coding exons in further 54 GPP and 319 palmoplantar PP patients by Sanger without identifying further truncating variants. SERPINA3 is an excellent functional candidate as it encodes serine protease inhibitor A3 which inhibits cathepsin G, a neutrophil speci ï¬c protease known to increase IL 36Ã activity >500fold. SERPINA3 expression in liver cell lines, ï¬broblasts and the epidermal cell line HaCaT could be stimulated by pro inï¬ammatory cytokines and dexamethasone. Protein amounts in sera of the two mutation carriers were in the lower normal range. By transfecting HaCaT cells withvectors containing the mutant or wildtype cDNA, we observed evidence for an unstable mRNA and lack of protein in the mutant. Immunohistochemical analysesrevealed an increased staining of serpin A3 within upper epidermal layers in GPP, accentuated at the edge of psoriatic pustules.

Over the past years, many studies have triedto identify how IFN Î»and Type I Interferon pathway genes are expressed during treatment. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the expression of genes of the type I IFN signaling pathway in 24 CHC patients treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin and further strati ï¬ed according to rs12979860 polymorphism. Samples were evaluated at different time points (time 0, week 1 and week 12 during treatment and week 3 after treatment). Allelic discrimination was performed usingTaqman Genotyping SNP assay (AHBKCW9, Thermo Fisher). Expression levels for 30 Type I IFN genes was evaluated using Biomark HD System (Fluidigm). Kruskal Wallis and DunnÂ´s post tests were used for comparisons. Results: Most of the genes had elevated expression levels before treatment, except for IFNA1, IFNAR and IFHI . Overall, they had a decline in week 1 and a signi ï¬cant higher expression levels in later time points. In week 1 during treatment, CC homozygote patients for rs12979860had lower gene expression levels, compared to patients that carried the risk allele T, this was observed for IFI6, IFI16, IRF9 andRIGI . In contrast, relative mRNA expression for IFH1 andRNASEL were subtle higher in patients with CC genotype. Conclusions: Gene expression levels in Type I IFN sig nature genes was different according to time points eval uated and also when patients were strati ï¬ed according to rs12989860 polymorphism. A.

It comprises both IL1 agonists and antagonists that together are responsible for maintain ing a balance in innate immunological response. Commonvariants in underlying genes have previously been asso ciated with infection, in ï¬ammation, cardiovascular disease and cancer, whereas the role of rare variants remains to beelucidated. The highly multiplexed targeted re sequencing technol ogy Molecular Inversion Probes (MIPs) enabled a genetic screen for the complete coding sequence of 48 genes of the IL1 pathway. Rare Variant Burden Analysis (RVBA) was performed on 520 healthy individuals for whom extensive immunophenotyping measurements are available. We identi ï¬ed 221 variants, out of which 166 rare (gno mAD Exome AF< 1%), in 41 genes. When considering individuals with 1% most extreme cytokine production,RVBA showed association with identical genes over dif ferent stimulations; e.g. in individuals with the highest IL6 producing macrophages, IL1R2 is associated with LPS , Candida and MTB stimulations. When using the con tinuous measurements, associated genes are unique per stimulation. More than 50% of the continuous associationsbecome stronger in extreme phenotypes; e.g. IL6 production in whole blood stimulated with PHA is asso ciated to NCF4 continuously, in the corresponding 1% of individuals with lowest IL6 production this signal is mag niï¬ed and even extended by associations with NCF2 and CYBA (other ROS production genes). We show that distinctive rare genetic variation, identi ï¬ed by MIPs, in ï¬uence cytokine responses to various stimuli in different cell types in healthy individuals.

Weaimed to identify non MHC region markers associated with1368IgAD by de ï¬ned genotypic subgroups of IgAD based on MHC susceptibility alleles. Materials and Methods: Total of 10993 individuals were analyzed. Previously published MHC risk haplotypes were evaluated and the subjects were then strati ï¬ed based on the MHC susceptibility alleles ( HLA*B0801 DRB1*0301 DQB1*0201/HLA DRB1*0701 DQB1*0202/ HLA DRB1*01 DQB1*0501 ). Gene based association ana lysis was performed to investigate the non MHC associationusing approximately 540000 SNPs and 24000 genes. Additionally, polygenic risk score (PRS) pathway/gene set analysis was performed using 4760 pathway/genes set toinfer the pathway involved in the respective subgroup. Results: The presence of HLA DRB1*0301 DQB1*0201 (P,0.07) or HLA DRB1*0701 (P,0.72) alone was not sufï¬cient to confer susceptibility to IgAD. In the cohort carrying at least one MHC risk allele, a protective allele, rs4097492, at STXBP6 (P,7.63x10 â9) was observed. CD40 (P,6.89x10â5) was observed potentially associated with patients homozygous for the HLA B*0801 DRB1*0301 DQB1*0201 haplotype whereas DHX38 (P,8.60x10â5), a novel inhibitor of protein phosphatase 4, shows a weak association with patients homozygous for HLA DRB1*01 DQB1*0501 . For patients lacking any risk alleles, seven gene regions were identi ï¬ed, including TNFRSF13B (TACI) (P,1.12x10â4), with suggestive evidence of association with IgAD. Pathway PRS analysis shows that cohort car rying at least one HLA B*0801 DRB1*0301 DQB1*0201 haplotype have strong association with autoimmune and immune pathway while HLA DRB1*01 DQB1*0501 cohort having association with asthma pathway and IgA production.

30417,"Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) are disorders consisting of thrombocytopenia (reduction in number of platelets), thromobocytopathy (defect in function of platelets) or acombination of these. Diagnosis is often hampered by the lack of speci ï¬city and correct validation of currenthematological assays. In addition, these disorders exhibit a genetic heterogeneity with over 50 genes involved. This study reports the results of an upfront diagnostic strategy using whole exome sequencing (WES) with a targeted analysis of a panel of 145 genes involved in thrombosis and hemostasis (besides platelet genes also other genes involvedin coagulation and venous thrombosis embolism are analysed). Sixty Six patients suspicious for an IPD were subjected to this WES approach. Fourteen patients (21%)harbored (likely) pathogenic variants that explained the clinical spectrum in these patients. Genes affected were GP9,MYH9 (2 cases), NBEAL2 ,P2RY12 ,RUNX1 (3 cases), SLFN14 and VWF (2 cases); all involved in thrombocytopenia or thromobocytopathy. Additionally, 2 patients with a mutation in the THPO gene and 1 patient with a mutation in S EPRINC1 were observed, both genes are known to be involved in venousvenous thromboembolic disease thromboembolic diseasethromboembolic diseaseve nous thromboembolic disease.

Consequently, leading to misdiagnosis and misclassi ï¬cation of patients in a clinical setting. Although whole exome sequencing (WES) has proven its signi ï¬cance as a diagnostic assay in PIDs, two Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1369thirds of all patients remains diagnosis negative. As accurate identi ï¬cation of the underlying genetic defect is paramount to the clinical management of the disease, exploring alternative approaches to improve PID diagnosis is crucial. Given the relative ease of access to the affected tissue and ex vivo stimulations, we hypothesize RNA sequencing holds the potential to reduce this diagnostic gap signiï¬cantly. To gain functional insight into the host response, 3âmRNA seq was performed on peripheral blood mono nuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from ï¬ve healthy donors. Mimicking bacterial, viral, fungal and a more generalimmune response, PBMCs were exposed to speci ï¬c immune stimulants, i.e. S. Auris, PolyI:C, C. Albicans and LPS, respectively, in vitro for 4 and 24 hours (n ,50). Differentially expressed genes were identi ï¬ed by correcting for baseline expression in non stimulated PBMCs. In turn, comparison of differential expression between conditionsenabled us to unravel the core host response, as well as pathogen speci ï¬c responses in both the early and late con text. Collectively, these insights not only aid our quest toidentify novel PID candidate genes, i.e. genes of unknown function or undescribed immune function, it also assists WES based variant ï¬ltering and prioritization.

Using this work ï¬ow we, so far, have analyzed the exomes of 14 patients using a primary immunode ï¬ciency gene panel (currently 386 genes). Depending on the clinicalphenotype, another gene panel analysis and/or an analysis of the entire exome was additionally performed in 8 out of 14 cases. For 10 of the 14 cases trio sequencing wasperformed to enable de novo analysis. The panel analyses resulted in a genetic diagnosis in 3 patients (21%). In these3 patients we detected a homozygous (likely) pathogenic variant in the genes MKL1 ,DHFR andPRF1 , respectively. The exome wide analysis did not result in additional diagnoses. For the 3 solved cases the genetic diagnosis had direct impact on the clinical decision making. Medication was adjusted, speci ï¬c dietary suggestions were provided for the DHFR case and the genetic diagnosis was instrumental in ï¬nding potential matching transplantation donors for the PRF1 andMKL1 cases.

However, these rare variants cannot be classi ï¬ed clinically vice versa those common variants only marginally contributes to disease susceptibility. In this study, we evaluated the multi gene panel results of CVID patients and argued that if rare variants located in differentgenes could in fact play a more important role in disease susceptibility and/or etiology. Material and Methods: We performed NGS from 103 patients âperipheral blood via a CVID related 19 genes panel (CARD11, CD19, CD81, ICOS, CTLA4, CXCR4, GATA2, ICOS, IRF2BP2, MOGS, MS4A1, NFKB1, NFKB2,PLCG2, TNFRSF13B, TNFRSF13C, TNFSF12, TRNT1 and TTC37) . Detected variants were evaluated and classi ï¬ed based on their impact, pathogenicity classi ï¬cation and population frequency as well as the frequency within our study group. Results: Next generation sequencing revealed 112 dif ferent (total of 227) variants with under 10% population frequency in 103 patients which 22 (19.6%) were benign,137028 (25%) were likely benign, 5 (4.5%) were likely patho genic and 2 (1,8%) were pathogenic. Moreover, 55 (49.1%) variants were classi ï¬ed as variant of uncertain signi ï¬cance. We also observed different variant frequencies when com pared to population frequency databases. Conclusion: Case control data is not suf ï¬cient enough to unravel the genetic etiology of immune de ï¬ciencies.

Differential expression (DE) analysis with MAST bulk like scRNA seq, shows high (97.3%) concordance with an independent bulk RNA seq candida cohort. In addition, MAST was also run on 7 cell types to identify cell type speciï¬c DE effects.

To identify genetic risk loci in juvenile onset SLE (jSLE) we performed DNA sequencing in a Swedish SLE cohort. Materials and Methods: Coding and regulatory regions of 1853 genes were sequenced in 958 patients with SLE and in 1030 healthy individuals. 117 of the patients had jSLE(disease onset at age <18 years). Target capturing was performed with a Roche NimbleGen custom liquid capture library followed by Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing. Results: Single variant case control association analysis revealed that 40 SNVs were associated with jSLE (FDR<5%). These 40 SNVs were enriched for missensevariants (8% vs 1.8% for all SNVs). Two coding SNVs in theNCF2 gene showed the strongest evidence of associa tion to jSLE (rs17849502 and rs17849501, best P ,1E 10, OR,3.9, 95% CI[2.6 5.9]). This association exceeded the signal from the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region in statistical signi ï¬cance (best HLA SNV was TNXB rs369580, P ,6E 08, OR ,2.5[1.8 3.5]). In order to further isolate the genetic contribution to jSLE, a case case asso ciation analysis comparing juvenile and adult onset SLEcases was also performed. The two top loci from this ana lysis were IL27 andLIFR (P<1E 05). Currently replication of these two loci is ongoing in an additional 100 jSLE cases. Conclusion: Using targeted sequencing we have identi ï¬ed coding SNVs in novel candidate risk loci in jSLE,1372highlighting differences in the genetic risk factors for childhood and adult onset SLE.

Heterozygous mutations in SPTB , encoding Î² spectrin, cause autosomal dominant hereditary spherocy tosis. Few cases of bi allelic mutations have been reported,with severe consequences, including hydrops fetalis and fatal or near fatal anaemia. Rapid genomic testing facilitates early diagnosis and informs management in critically illpatients. We describe rapid genomic diagnosis of a novel homozygous SPTB mutation in a case of severe prenatal onset haemolytic anaemia with transfusion dependence, andconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with hepatosplenomegaly. Methods: Clinical rapid trio exome testing was per formed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood usingAgilent Sureselect QXT CREv2 kit, followed by sequen cing on Illumina NextSeq500.Results: We identi ï¬ed a novel homozygous missense var iant NM_001024858.3( SPTB ):c.6119C>T (p. Thr2040Ile), located in the spectrin repeat region. Parents were both het erozygous for this variant. The time from sample receipt to result was 68hrs. Pretransfus ion eosin 5 maleimide (E5M) staining in the proband was markedly reduced (ratio <0.6) andblood ï¬lm showed marked spherocy tosis including micro spherocytes and nucleated erythrocytes. Both parents demonstrated mildly reduced E5M staining, with occasionalspherocytes and elliptocytes seen in the maternal and paternal blood ï¬lms respectively. The proband has life threatening haemolytic anaemia with progressive liver failure, and earlygenetic diagnosis has facilitated hypertransfusion to suppress ineffective erythropoiesis and reverse hepatic dysfunction. Conclusions: This case of severe prenatal haemolytic anaemia due to a homozygous SPTB mutation broadens the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of spectrin de ï¬ciency and highlights the value of rapid early genomic diagnosis.

Genome wide association test of these variants reproduced the associations of previously reported common variants on HLA A and chromosome 16q12.1 loci. In addition, the novel associations of micro satellite polymorphism near CDH12 gene and the aggre gation of rare coding variants on TRPM8 andPARD3 genes were identi ï¬ed.in silico gene expression analysis revealed that the disease susceptibility alleles of HLA A andBRD7 affect gene expression levels at whole blood in GTEx database. Conclusion: Majority of variants with signi ï¬cant asso ciation with CM SJS/TEN with SOC were found among non coding region illuminating the regulatory role of genetic variations on the development of CM SJS/TENwith SOC.

Within the setting of a population based birth cohort, we investigated genetic predictors of immune responses to bacterial and viral stimuli in children. Materials and Methods: We measured cytokine responses (n ,27) to stimuli including live viruses and bacteria (n ,14) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from children at ages 11 (n ,306) and 16 (n ,335) years. We sequenced exons, promoters and 3 â and 5 â UTRs of 364 immune response genes. After QC, 1705 SNPs (LD R 2< 0.8 and MAF > 8%) and 328 differentially expressed cytokine stimulus pairs at age 11, and 364 cytokine stimulus pairs at age 16 were available for cytokineQuantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis using linear regression. Results: A missense variant in Toll Like receptor 1 (TLR1) rs5743618 was a cytokine QTL for IFN gamma response to the TLR1/2 stimulus PAM3CSK4 at age 11 (p value FDRcorr,1x10 4) and age 16 (p value FDRcorr,3.42x10 9) years. The same variant was a cytokine QTL for IL 13 response to PAM3CSK4 at age 11 (p value FDRcorr,1x10 4) and age 16 (p value FDRcorr,3.53x10 3) and IL 2 response to LPS at age 11 (p value FDRcorr,0.031) and age 16 (p value FDRcorr,3.34x10 2) years. Conclusions: The missense variant rs5743618 in TLR1 was identi ï¬ed as the main cytokine QTL for IFN gamma and IL 13 to TLR1/2 ligand PAM3CSK4 as well as IL 2responses to LPS.

In rare cases, life threatening infections may occur in previously healthychildren. To uncover this susceptibility to severe disease we searched for rare genetic variants in 120 children requiring intensive care support upon infection by a respiratory virus. We used exome sequencing followed by protein network analysis to catalog rare coding variants and cluster them by known physical and functional associations. We identi ï¬ed potentially causal variants in 14 genes involved in proin ï¬ammatory response and viral nucleic acid detection, including DDX58 andIFIH1 , encoding RIG I and MDA5, respectively. Both proteins share a common mechanism of RNA recognition and signal repression. In the absence of viral infection, each is maintained in an autoinhibited state,where the CARD effector domain and the ATP binding helicase domain are masked by the C terminal repressor domain (CTD). Binding of viral dsRNA at the CTD relievesrepression and results in a proin ï¬ammatory cascade. Three loss of function variants in IFIH1 were previously reported1374for this cohort. A further four patients had helicase / ATP binding domain variants in IFIH1 and one patient with a rare CTD variant. Rare variants were found in DDX58 affecting the RNA binding motif; one patient harboured a variant predicted to disrupt the ATP binding helicase. In total, we identi ï¬ed 10 rare variants in 15 patients. We present a primary immunode ï¬ciency resulting in extreme susceptibility to common respiratory RNA viruses, due to genetic variants in a common pathway that severely impairsviral recognition.

FA is caused by point mutations and large deletions in 22 genes following 3 heritability patterns, making it diagnostics challenging. Material and Methods: 68 FA patients with a positive chromosome fragility test were analyzed by WES. Copy number variations were evaluated by sequencing data ana lysis with Rstudio. To test FANCA missense variants, wtFANCA cDNA was cloned and variants were introducedby site directed mutagenesis, and tested for its ability to complement DNA repair defects of a FANCA KO human cell line generated by TALEN technologies. Results: using WES data, we identi ï¬ed 93.3% of mutated alleles including large deletions later con ï¬rmed by MLPA or SNPs arrays. We demonstrated pathogenicity of 3FANCA missense variants and demonstrated that 2 FANCA variants reported in mutations databases as âaffecting functions âare non pathogenic SNPs. Deep analysis of sequencing data revealed the actual mutations, highlighting the importance of functional analysis. Conclusion: WES and proper bioinformatics analysis are sufï¬cient to effectively characterize FA patients regardless complementation group, type of mutations, mosaic condi tion, and DNA source. M.

Kosaki1 1Center for Medical Genetics, Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan,2Department of Pediatrics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan [Background]Chromosome 12q15 microdeletion is charac terized by intellectual disability and dysmorphic facialfeatures. Recently, the smallest region of overlap (SRO) in 16 previously reported patients was used to de ï¬ne three candidate genes for the 12q15 microdeletion syndrome:CNOT2 ,KCNMB4 , and PTPRB . The relative contributions of these three genes have not yet been delineated. Herein, we document a patient with a microdeletion of thechromosomal 12q15 region and re de ï¬ne the SRO. [Clinical Report]The patient was a 12 year old female with intellec tual disability and multiple structural abnormalities includ ing cleft lip and palate and 2 3 toe syndactyly. She exhibited dysmorphic facial features such as upslanting and short palpebral ï¬ssures, micrognathia, low set ears, and hypoplastic antihelix. [Molecular Analysis] A microarray analysis showed a de novo 1.32 Mb deletion within 12q15 that included CNOT2 , a member of the CCR4 NOT complex that regulates gene expression by regulating transcription and mRNA degradation, and 14 other genes. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1375Results and Discussion: Remapping of the 12q15 dele tion region in the 16 previously reported patients together with that in the newly identi ï¬ed patient indicated that CNOT2 is the only gene that is commonly deleted.

Recently, a study has highlighted LSS associated to hypotrichosis simplex. We expanded the phenotypic spectrum of LSSto a recessive neuroectodermal syndrome formerly named Alopecia with mental retardation (APMR) syndrome. It is a rare autosomal recessive conditioncharacterized by hypotrichosis and intellectual disability (ID) or developmental delay (DD), frequently associated with early onset epilepsy and other dermatological features. Methods: Through a multi center international colla borative study, we identi ï¬edLSS pathogenic variants in APMR individuals either by exome sequencing or LSS Sanger sequencing. Splicing defects were assessed by transcripts analysis and minigenes assays. Results: We reported 10 APMR individuals from 6 unrelated families with bi allelic variants in LSS. W e additionally identi ï¬ed one affected individual with a single rare variant in LSS and an allelic imbalance suggesting a second event. Among the identi ï¬ed variants, two were truncating, seven were missense and two were splicing variants. Quanti ï¬cation of cholesterol and its precursors did not reveal noticeable imbalance. Conclusion: In the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, the lanosterol synthase leads to the cyclization of (S) 2,3 oxi dosqualene into lanosterol. Our data suggest LSSas a major gene causing a rare recessive neuroectodermal syndrome. T. Besnard: None. N. Sloboda: None. A. Goldenberg: None. S. KÃ¼ry: None. B. CognÃ©: None. F. Breheret: None. E.

Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Approximately 10% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS) remainwithout a molecular diagnosis (AS like). Whole exome sequencing in a cohort of 17 AS like patients led to the identi ï¬cation of 11 pathogenic/likely pathogenic de novo variants in 10 genes involved in neurodevelopment disorders, not previously associated with AS. Clinical re evaluation was performed in order to establish thegenotype phenotype correlation in the molecularly diag nosed patients. Materials and Methods: The clinical characteristics of the 11 patients were reviewed for the presence of the con sistent and frequent AS clinical features. Additional dis tinctive clinical features were collected and compared withthe clinical phenotypes reported in the literature in patients carrying pathogenic variants in the identi ï¬ed genes. Results: Clinical re evaluation showed that the 11 patients meet the consistent and almost all of the frequent features of AS. The additional clinical ï¬ndings in patients carrying variants in SMARCE1, KIF1A, SYNGAP1 and SLC6A1 genes ï¬t with the phenotypes reported in patients with pathogenic variants in the same genes. On the otherhand, patients carrying variants in SATB2, ASXL3, SPTAN1 and LAS1L genes present some but not all the consistent features attributed to these genes. Conclusion: Molecular heterogeneity in AS like patients, together with the presence of distinctive clinical features in some of them, indicates that AS like is made up by differentclinical entities overlapping phenotypically with AS, mak ing them dif ï¬cult to distinguish.

Thus, thorase plays an essential role in neurotransmission. Biallelic loss of function or activating ATAD1 mutations have been recently described in six patients from three different families. They presented with severe encephalopathy characterized byneonatal stiffness, limited or absent mobility, poor eye contact, feeding dif ï¬culties and respiratory distress. Here, we report on two novel infants with this congenital immobility and hypertonia syndrome. Patient #1 needed intensive cares from birth because of secondary neonatal respiratory distress. He had extreme stiffness of limbs andaxial hypotonia, immobility, absence of eye contact, limited responsiveness to stimuli and weak sucking. He hadepileptic seizures at 5 months and died at 6 months. Patient #2 had a similar disease course, except that he had no epilepsy. He died at 4 months of cardio respiratory failure. Both patients had null auditory evoked potentials. Whole exome sequencing (WES) in patient #2 revealed the previously reported c.1070_1071del p.(His357Argfs*15) ATAD1 homozygous variant.

Materials and Methods: In the context of an Interna tional project aiming at identifying the genetic causes of ASD (Autism Sequencing Consortium, Mount Sinai), weperformed a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis in a cohort of 100 ASD patients, not harboring CNVs, attending the Medical Genetics Unit of Siena. Results: Mutations in already known ASD related genes were detected in 11% of cases, while either de novo or inherited mutations in novel genes were identi ï¬ed in 21% of cases. The novel identi ï¬ed genes can be pooled in three categories: i genes for which causative mutations have not1378been previously reported (eight genes), ii genes for which a likely association with ASD has been previously reported in a single case (eg DRP2 etc) and iii genes whose mutations have been previously associated with intellectual disability (ID) in only one (eg BCORL1 etc) or a few families (eg BRD4 recently associated with a Cornelia De Lange likephenotype etc). Conclusions: Overall, our extensive approach goes beyond safely con ï¬rming the pathogenic role of ASD/ID candidate genes and allows establishing the novel role of ID related genes in ASD. It delineates the impact of new genes across neurodevelopmental dimensions, providingimportant new insights into functional pathways involved in heterogeneous ASD phenotypes. F. Mari: None. C.

In vivo andin vitro studies have shown an important role of the Notch ligand DLL1 in the development of the nervous system and somites, amongothers. We identi ï¬ed 14 individuals from ten unrelated families with heterozygous DLL1 variants by exome sequencing. The most common features in our cohort were intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, seizures and variable brain malformations. Four patients had scoliosis includingone with a vertebral segmentation defect. We identi ï¬ed six nonsense variants, two splice site variants, one missense variant affecting a highly conserved cysteine in the DSLdomain, and one 122 kb deletion containing DLL1 . Ana lysis of the splice site variant NM_005618.4:c.54 +1G>A showed an in frame insertion of 12 bp near the sequencecoding for the signal peptide, possibly affecting proper localization of the mutant DLL1 protein. The features in our cohort resemble those of patients with overlapping terminaldeletions of 6q27 encompassing DLL1 , supporting the previous hypothesis that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of DLL1 is causative of the phenotype in this deletion. In conclusion, we identi ï¬ed heterozygous mutations in DLL1 in a cohort with a variable neurodevelopmental phenotype and other multi system features.

BRD4 mediates CDK9 activity to in ï¬uence transcrip tion elongation by RNA polymerase II and thus regulatesgene expression, cell differentiation and cell cycle. Recently, frameshift and missense variants were reported with a Cornelia de Lange like phenotype. In threeindependent families we identi ï¬ed 2 missense and 1 frameshift heterozygous de novo variants in BRD4 (c.1856G>T; c.2513A>T; c.2728delC). The individualswith the c.1856G>T and the c.2728delC variants presented with intellectual disability and Cornelia de Lange like facial gestalt. Short stature was present in all but the individualwith the frameshift variant. Protein structure modelling indicates that variant c.1856G>T (p. Ser619Iso) likely affects binding of BRD4 to its ligands. Expression analysisshowed that both missense variants, but not the frameshift variant, lead to a reduced expression indicating a loss of function effect of all three identi ï¬ed variants. Immuno ï¬uorescence analysis from cells with the missense variants conï¬rmed a reduced cellular growth and smaller cell size compared to controls. Transcriptional pro ï¬ling to assess the effect of BRD4 on known effector proteins highlighted a complex dysregulation in patient and CRISPR/Cas9 meditated BRD4 defect cell lines. We expand the clinical spectrum of mutations in BRD4 from idiopathic short stature without distinct facial gestalt to a Cornelia de Lange like phenotype and propose a loss of function effect of BRD4 mutations. The variability of the phenotype might in part be explained be different effects on target effector genes. N. N. Hauer: None. C. Vogl: None. B. Popp: None. C. BÃ¼ttner: None. S. Uebe: None. H.

However, the phenotypic spectrum of individuals heterozygous for CHD8 truncating variants has not been clearly de ï¬ned. We investigated 26 individuals with CHD8 protein truncating variants (PTVs), including 10 previously unreported patients, and found a1380pattern of common features: macrocephaly (76%), tall stature (65%), developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD/ID, 81%), autism spectrum disorders (ASD, 81%), sleep dif ï¬culties (48%), gastrointestinal problems (42%), and distinct facial features. The gestalt is reminiscent of Sotos and Weaver syndromes. Most of the individuals inour cohort had moderate to severe intellectual disability, and some had regression of speech (37%), seizures (27%) and hypotonia (27%), and two individuals were also non ambulant. Most individuals had ASD (81%), similarly to previous studies, but we found a higher incidence of comorbid neurodevelopmental delay/impairment.

Methods: We describe 13 novel patients with a likely pathogenic de novo CLTC variant, identi ï¬ed by using diagnostic exome sequencing or an ID gene panel. Results: All individuals presented with intellectual dis ability (ID), ranging from mild to moderate/severe, with or without additional neurologic, behavioral, craniofacial, ophthalmologic and gastrointestinal features. The severeend of the clinical spectrum, including severe ID, epilepsy, microcephaly and hypoplasia of corpus callosum was more frequently observed in the group of individuals with mis sense and in frame variants than in those with nonsense and frameshift variants, although this difference was not sig niï¬cant (Fisher âs Exact Test; p value>0.0125). A 3D model of the CHC1 protein showed that the de novo missense CLTC variants do not cluster in 3D dimensional proximity. However, these variants may affect the interaction withother clathrin heavy and light chains as CHC1 interacts with three light chains to form clathrin. The nonsense and fra meshift variants are all predicted to result in nonsense mediated mRNA decay. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that missense and in frame variants exert a dominant negativeeffect (antimorph), whereas the nonsense and frameshift variants would result in haploinsuf ï¬ciency (hypomorph). Consequently, the wide phenotypic variability observed inCLTC related ID seems to be associated with allelic heterogeneity. M. J. Nabais SÃ¡: None. H. Venselaar: None. L. Wiel: None. A.

To date, 25 affected individuals have been reported. Most ofpatients have severe ID with absent or limited expressive speech and limited verbal comprehension. Only two patients with moderate ID and able to use sentences werereported. We described four children from three families with novel homozygous or compound heterozygous deleterious CNVs and mutations in CNTNAP2 gene. Motormilestones were mildly delayed in all patients, with a walking age between 22 and 30 months. All patients had ID. Two patients had severe ID with complete lack ofspeech. Two unrelated patients had mild ID with preserved speech and good verbal comprehension. One of them was able to write and read, while his brother had severeintellectual disability with no language. Epilepsy occurred in all patients, with an age at onset between 3 and 24 months. One patient was seizure free for 4 years. Allpatients, except one, had cortical dysplasia. No speci ï¬c facial dysmorphism was noted. Birth parameters and post natal growth were in the normal range. In conclusion, wereported four individuals from three families with biallelic aberrations in CNTNAP2 causing ID and additional features such as epilepsy and cortical dysplasia. In contrast toprevious reports, we observed moderate ID with preserved speech and verbal comprehension in two children suggest ing clinical variability even in a same family. M. Rio: None. C.

Here we present a case of an 838kb de novo2q14.3 deletion involving multiple exons of CNTNAP5 in a child with developmental delay and microcephaly. Materials and Methods: A 9 year old girl with an intellectual disability and microcephaly (OFC < 0.4th per centile) was seen in the genetics clinic. The girl had parti cular dif ï¬culties with visual spatial tasks and she had very low working memory and processing speed. An 850 kb SNP array (Illumina Human CytoSNP 12 Beadchip) was done which identi ï¬ed the deletion. No other copy number variations were identi ï¬ed and detailed investigations for an alternative cause were all normal. Parents were of normal intelligence. Results: An 838kb de novo 2q14.3 deletion was identi ï¬ed (chr2: 125,204,264 126,042,867; hg19). There are few reports of deletions involving CNTNAP5 but all have involved multiple other genes or copy number variants. This is the ï¬rst reported case of a de novo deletion disrupting CNTNAP5 in an individual with intellectual disability and microcephaly and no other CNVs identi ï¬ed. CNTNAP5 is a member of the neurexin family of multidomain transmem brane proteins involved in cell adhesion and intercellularcommunication, leading to our hypothesis that mutations in CNTNAP5 result in abnormalities of neurodevelopment. Conclusion: We hypothesise that CNTNAP5 is an important gene in neurodevelopment and disruption of CNTNAP5 causes neurodevelopmental disability. 2q14.3 deletions involving CNTNAP5 may constitute a new dele tion syndrome.

30441,"Kamran Shabbir2, S. Malik2, A. Tolun1 1Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey,2Quaid i Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan Background: The global prevalence of intellectual dis ability is estimated to be around 1%; however, the molecular basis remains unknown in most cases. We studied a consanguineous Pakistani kinship with severeintellectual disability, mild lissencephaly, brain atrophy and progressive decline in cognitive skills to identify the genetic basis of the disease. Materials and Methods: Homozygosity mapping was performed and exome sequence ï¬le of one affected indivi dual was investigated for candidate variants. Results: In a 3.9 Mb region of shared homozygosity, we detected CRADD c.2T>G variant and novel USP441382c.873_884del and c.886delA variants. CRADD variant alters the initiation codon (AUG âAGG; p.(M1?) or p. (M1A)), and it is extremely rare (highest MAF ,3.28E 05). CRADD variant leads to premature translational termination. Discussion: Biallelic damaging variants in CRADD cause recessive mental retardation 34 (MRT34) with mild to moderate intellectual disability (ID) and in some cases additional lissencephaly and megalencephaly. Only one IDfamily has been reported with an USP44 variant, which is a deletion similar to ours. Phenotype of our patients, severe intellectual disability and mild lissencephaly but no sei zures, is different from phenotypes of patients with CRADD orUSP44 mutations alone and is not as severe as would be expected of an additive effect. Conclusion: Familial linked homozygous variants are very rare, and we found such variants in CRADD and USP44 in two cousins with severe intellectual disability and mild lissencephaly. This study also highlights that whole exome sequencing rather than candidate gene approach can uncover a novel molecular basis for a disorder. M. Koprulu: None. G. Nalbant: None. Q. Zaman: None. R.

Recently, de novo variants affecting the amino acid p. Arg87 of CYFIP2Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1383were reported in four individuals with epileptic encephalo pathy. We here report 12 independent patients harboring a variety of de novo variants in CYFIP2 broadening the molecular and clinical spectrum of a novel CYFIP2 related neurodevelopmental disorder. Using trio whole exome or genome sequencing, we identi ï¬ed 12 independent patients carrying a total of eight distinct de novo variants in CYFIP2 with a shared phenotype of intellectual disability, seizures, and muscular hypotonia. We detected seven differentmissense variants, of which two occurred recurrently (p. (Arg87Cys) and p.(Ile664Met)), and a splice donor variant in the last intron for which we showed exon skipping in thetranscript. The latter is expected to escape nonsense mediated mRNA decay resulting in a truncated protein. Despite the large spacing in the primary structure, thevariants spatially cluster in the tertiary structure and are all predicted to weaken the interaction with WAVE1 or NCKAP1 of the actin polymerization regulating WRC complex. Preliminary genotype âphenotype correlation indi cates a profound phenotype in p. Arg87 substitutions and a more variable phenotype in other alterations. This studyevidenced a variety of de novo variants in CYFIP2 as a novel cause of mostly severe intellectual disability with seizures and muscular hypotonia. M. Zweier: None. A. Begemann: None. K.

In 234 cases we ran Trio analysis; in another 79 cases we sequenced more than one affectedindividual per family. With this approach we could identify pathogenic variants or CNVs in 31% of the cases and prioritize candidate variants of unclear signi ï¬cance in another 17.6% of the cases. About 66% of the pathogenic variants occurred de novo or were transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner,while 21% of the variants were autosomal recessive. Only a minority of 11% was X chromosomal and less than 1% occurred in mitochondrial DNA. Among these we identi ï¬ed several cases with pathogenic variants in HNRNPH2, NBEA ,PUS3 ,RHOBTB2 ,TBCK and TBC1D23 , genes that have been associated with ID very recently. Besides identifying pathogenic variants in genes previously associated with ID, we were also able to identify 22 new candidate genes such as BCL11B ,FBXO11 andKMT2E .

FernÃ¡ndez Urquiza2, S. JimÃ©nez Romero3 1Faculty of Philology, Seville, Spain,2Faculty of Humanities, Oviedo, Spain,3Faculty of Psychology, CÃ³rdoba, Spain In this talk we will report on a boy with a microdeletion in 8p23.1 (arr[hg19] 8p23.1 (7169490 7752586) and a micro duplication in 9p24.3 (arr[hg19] 9p24.3 (266045 459076). Our proband exhibits a moderate language delay, mostlyaffecting the expressive domain, as well as cognitive delay and behavioural de ï¬cits, including attentional problems and aggressiveness. Whereas the microdeletion in chromosome8 is reported as benign, the microduplication in chromo some 9 is hypothesized as pathogenic, affecting the body of the gene DOCK8 . We will discuss the role of this gene in brain development and function, focusing on the functional links of the DOCK8 protein with CDC42, in turn associated to nearly 30 candidates for language disorders and/orlanguage evolution, including SLIT1, SLIT2, and ROBO1, which play a key role in the externalization of language (speech). We will also present results of a targeted wholetranscriptome sequencing analysis (RNA seq) aimed to determine changes in the expression levels in the blood of DOCK8 , its functional partners with a known role in language development, impairment, and/or evolution (ABL1, DCDC2, DOCK4, MAPK1, MET, ROBO1 , and SLIT2 ), and several other robust candidate genes for language disorders and/or language evolution ( AUTS2, BAZ1B, BMP2, CMIP, CNTNAP2, DLX1, ELP4, FLNA, FOXP1, FOXP2, GRIN2A, POU3F2, RUNX2 , and SOX9 ). We will conclude that the phenotype exhibited by our proband might result from a severe de ï¬cit in working memory (mostly impacting on language structure and use),seemingly resulting from a reduced dosage of DOCK8 and the subsequent alteration of a CDC42 regulated network important for language development.

In aconsanguineous Pakistani family with three affected indivi duals presenting with microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, cerebral malformations and dysmorphic facialfeatures, we identi ï¬ed a homozygous splice donor site variant (NM_001378.2:c.607 +1G>A). We report twoAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1385additional cases with similar neurodevelopmental de ï¬cits and craniofacial features who harbor deleterious variants: an individual bearing a p.(Tyr247Cys) change in trans with a 374 kb deletion encompassing DYNC1I2 ; and an unrelated case harboring compound heterozygous variants p. (Gln290*) and p.(Tyr247Cys). F0 zebra ï¬sh larvae with CRISPR/Cas9 gene disruption or transient suppression of dync1i2a displayed signi ï¬cantly altered craniofacial pattern ing with concomitant reduction in head size. We monitoredcell death and cell cycle progression in dync1i2a zebra ï¬sh models and observed signi ï¬cantly increased apoptosis, likely due to prolonged mitosis caused by abnormal spindlemorphology, offering initial insights into the cellular basis of microcephaly. Additionally, complementation studies in zebra ï¬sh demonstrate that the p.(Tyr247Cys) attenuates gene function, consistent with protein structural analysis. Our genetic and functional data indicate that the DYNC1I2 dysfunction likely causes an autosomal recessive micro cephaly syndrome, and highlight further the critical roles of the dynein 1 complex in neurodevelopment.

The microdeletions cause Kleefstra syndrome (KS), whose responsible gene is EHMT1 (euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1). A 9q34 duplication syndrome (9q34DS) had been reported in literature, but it has neverbeen characterized by a molec ular point of view. At the best of our knowledge, we report on the two patients carrying the smallest 9q34. 3 duplications containing EHMT1 as the only relevant gene. We compared them to 21 described patients carrying 9q34.3 duplications encompassing the entire gene and extending within 3Mb~. By surveying the available clinical and molecular cytogenetic data, we could ï¬nd out that similar neurode velopmental disorders (NDDs ) were shared by patients carriers of even very differen t sized duplications. More over, some facial features of the 9q34DS were more represented than those of KS. However, an accurate in silico analysis of the genes mapped in all the duplications allowed us to support EHMT1 as being suf ï¬cient to cause a NDD phenotype. Wider patient cohorts are needed todisentangle whether the rearrangements have full causa tive role or simply confer the susceptibility to NDDs and possibly to identify the cognitive and behavioral pro ï¬le associated to the EHMT1 increased dosage.

30446,"A. Verloes, A. Tabet AP HP, Paris, France Interstitial 6q15 q16.1 deletions are rare and few cases have been reported in the literature. Genotype phenotype correla tion is complex because of incomplete penetrance andvariable expressivity, various size and breakpoints of the 6q deletions. We report 6 additional patients from two families with 6q16.1 deletion encompassing or disrupting EPHA7 gene. All patients presented a neurodeveloppemental disorder. SNP array analysis of family 1 (patient 1 to 5) showed a 4,5 Mb deletion at 6q16.1 disrupting exons 10 17ofEPHA7 (OMIM *602190) in all affected children and also inherited from the affected father. For family 2 (patient13866), SNP array analysis revealed a 3,1 Mb deletion at 6q15q16.1 encompassing only one OMIM gene: EPHA7 . The ephrin receptor A7 ( EPHA7 , mapped in 6q16.1) encode a member of ephrin receptor subfamily of the protein tyrosine kinase family. EPH and EPH related receptors have been implicated in mediating developmental events,particularly in the nervous system. EphA7 play a role in cortical domains formation, determine brain size and shape, and is involved in development of the central nervoussystem. We provide further evidence for EPHA7 haploin sufï¬ciency role in neurodevelopmental disorder and delineate clinical phenotype. Interestingly, one patient(patient 3) had a 6q16.1 deletion encompassing EPHA7 and a 1,4 Mb 7q11.23 microdeletion associated with more severe symptoms than those observed inWilliams Beuren syndrome. EPHA7 deletion could also contribute to the most severe neurodevelopmental pheno type as a second hit. J. Levy: None. C. Dupont: None. H. Nasser: None. E. Yvon Chaou: None. M. Rachid: None. M.

Biallelic pathogenic var iants lead to decreased availability of N acetyl aspartate inthe brain, leading to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM #612949) with global cerebral hypomyelination, developmental regression, apnea, seizures, and muscularhypotonia. Case presentation: Here we report on a boy with pro found developmental and motor delay, drug resistant epi lepsy starting at 7 months and recurrent episodes of status epilepticus. Trio exome sequencing revealed the compound heterozygous variants in SCL25A12; c.225del; p.(Glu76 Serfs*17) and c.1747C>A; p.( ,), which are absent in public databases. As the phenotype was overlapping and the synonymous variant was predicted to alter the splicing, we performed mRNA analysis on blood of the patient thatrevealed a loss of full length cDNA. Western blot on muscle biopsy of the patient con ï¬rmed these results. Brain MRI including MR spectroscopy further supported thegenetic ï¬ndings since choline/myoinositol were found to be elevated in the medullary layer, whereas NAA was reduced. Conclusion: The clinical presentation as well as char acteristic MR spectroscopy pattern combined with the loss of mRNA/protein expression in patientÂ´s tissues con ï¬rmed the pathogenicity of both variants. Thus, we could set thediagnosis of EIEE39. However, at our lab and as far as we know at other laboratories, synonymous (and many spli cing) variants are not well characterized. Bioinformaticstools for splicing are often not well integrated and following mRNA analyses is hampered by technical and economical obstacles.

The molecular basis of the disorder is a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Normal repeat lengths are fewer than 50 triplets; the full mutation repeat size is more than 200 triplets. It has been shown that carriers of a large alleleAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1387exhibit repeat size somatic instability. This instability was suggested to be linked to symptom severity. Here, we present a study of the relationship between somatic instability in patients with changes in their brains and the severity of their psychiatric symptoms. Materials and Methods: Measurements of the repeat size were carried out by fragment analysis on an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer, and the MRIs were performed on an Achieva scanner with a magnetic ï¬eld strength of 1.5 T. Patients were diagnosed by genetic and psychiatric assessments at NCCH No. 1. Results: The ef ï¬ciency of PCR in repeat sizing does not allow the calculation of the instability index by the quan titation of each allele, as has been done previously in mouse studies. We developed a novel approach for evaluatingsomatic instability in humans based on repeat sizes and the number of alleles. A strong correlation between somatic instability and changes in brain region connectivity wasfound in Fragile X syndrome patients and in some brain regions of the patients âhealthy mothers. Additionally, somatic instability signi ï¬cantly in ï¬uenced the psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of Fragile X syndrome patients.

Recent studies suggested that a possible pathogenic genetic mutation can be identi ï¬ed in the majority of individuals with intellectual disability. However, many of the identi ï¬ed variants are genetic variants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VUS). To establish whether these variants are pathogenic,independent con ï¬rmation is needed. The PR iSM ( Pipeline forRapid in silico/in vitro/in vivo Screening of Mutations) is developed as a functional genomics screen to test thepathogenicity of such variants. (see: www.functiona lgenomics.nl ). Although we can make use of many speci ï¬c biochemical read outs to establish the pathogenicity of avariant ( eg, kinase assays, ubiquitin assays) the core assays of the PR iSM screen are hypothesis free: biologicalinformation about the protein is not a prerequisite to assess the pathogenicity of the variant. This allows us to assess whether variants in protein domains for which the precise function is unknown or cannot be assessed biochemically, are pathogenic. Moreover, we can test variants in proteins for which no biological information is available at all. During the presentation an overview will be given on the number of mutations tested until now using the PR iSM screening and their outcomes, discussing amongst others thesensitivity and speci ï¬city as well as the strengths and the weaknesses of this screen. Taken together, we have now setup a functional genomics screen which has alreadyproven its value at the diagnostic as well as the scienti ï¬c level. G. M. van Woerden: None. Y. Elgersma: None.",2019

The majority of reported patients harbored de novo loss of function (LoF) variants. To date, the phenotype of only four patients has been precisely described in the literature, contrasting with the relative frequency of detection of such LoF GATAD2B variants. Here, we describe 10 patients with con ï¬rmed LoF GATAD2B variants and further delineate the clinical phenotype. Methods: Patients were included by contacting referent clinicians from several French genetics departments. Results: Developmental delay was severe with a median age of 2.4 years (range [2 5]) for independent walking and of 2.75 years (range [1 4]) for ï¬rst spoken words. They showed very little subsequent progress, one patientremaining non verbal at age 30 years. ID was mostly moderate, with only one severe and one mild case, which differs from the original description of severe ID. Mostcommon dysmorphic features included broad forehead, deeply set eyes, hypertelorism, downturned mouth and, anomalies of the extremities. Conversely, prenatal compli cations, non cerebral organ malformations, epilepsy and autistic behaviour were very rare. One patient presented asthma and recurrent respiratory infections, another onepresented severe feeding dif ï¬culties and developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and IgG de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: NGS based approaches for sequencing will improve the detection of GATAD2B variations. Better knowledge of the clinical phenotype is essential for a cor rect interpretation of the molecular results and for anaccurate management of these patients. G. Vera: None. A. Sorlin: None. G.

Many of these proteins play crucial roles in neuronaldevelopment and function. Mutations in 18 of the 29 genes, implicated in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor, have been identi ï¬ed as the cause of GPI biosynthesis de ï¬ciencies (GPIBDs) in humans associated with intellectual disability and seizures as the cardinal features. PIGU is an essential component of the GPI transamidase complex along withPIGK ,PIGS ,PIGT , and GPAA1 that links GPI anchored proteins (GPI APs) onto the GPI anchor in the ER. Here, we report two homozygous missense mutations(NM_080476.4:c.209T>A and c.1149C>A) in ï¬ve indivi duals from three unrelated families. All individuals presented with global developmental delay, severe toprofound intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, sei zures, brain anomalies, scoliosis, and mild facial dysmorph ism. Using ï¬ow cytometry, a characteristic pro ï¬le for GPI transamidase de ï¬ciency consisting of reduced cell surface expression of FLAER, CD16, and CD24, but not CD55 and CD59 on granulocytes and free GPI anchor detected by T5antibody on B cells, was determined. Moreover, computer assisted facial analysis of different GPIBDs revealed a shared characteristic facial gestalt between individuals withmutations in PIGU andGPAA1 .

However, some of them are only detectable by e.g. FISH, MLPA orchromosomal microarrays (CMA) and are thus cryptic. Here, we present three unbalanced translocations detected after cytogenetic analyses with normal results at our insti tute in the last year. In Patient 1, a 10 year old girl with i.a. ID and dysmorphisms, CMA detected a 5.0Mb terminal gain of 2q and a 3.6Mb terminal loss of 21q. Surprisingly,the terminal imbalances in patients 2 and 3 were quite large: CMA detected an 11.4Mb loss of 10p and an 8.9Mb gain of 13q in Patient 2, a 10 month old boy with i.a. growthretardation, VSDs and choanal atresia. In Patient 3, a 15 year old boy with i.a. ID, short stature, microcephaly, sei zures and renal agenesis, CMA detected a 10.4Mb loss of9p and an 11.4Mb gain of 12p. FISH demonstrated unba lanced translocations in all patients and balanced maternal translocations for patients 1 and 2. For Patient 3, parentalmaterial was unavailable. Especially patients 2 and 3 are instructive examples with imbalances greater than 10Mb which theoretically should bedetectable by GTG banding. However, the affected regions were very similar in size and banding patterns and thus escaped detection by banding methods.

Nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) technologies signi ï¬cantly reduced the time of diagnostics compared to single gene sequencing. Optimal method of NGS is a whole (WES) orclinical (CES) exome sequencing. Materials and Methods: The study included 100 patients with various forms of ID. All cases were submitted fromgeneticists. Martin Bell, Rett syndromes and chromosomal pathology were excluded, the patients had no traumatic and infectious brain damage. WES was performed for 69patients. CES (panel of 6500 HGMD genes) was performed for 31 patients. Founded gene variants were con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing in trios. Results: We diagnosed syndromes (Kabuki, Cohen, Cowden, Nicolaides baraitser, ZTTK, Smith Magenis, Helsmoortel van der Aa, Cornelia de Lange like, multiplecongenital anomalies hypotonia seizures syndrome 1), metabolic diseases (MPS III type), early epilepsy ence phalopathy (type 4 and 7), mental retardation autosomaldominant (7, 8, 35, 36, 49 types, ID with a mutation in the GRIA1 ), mental retardation X linked (98 and 102 types), mesomelic dysplasia with a mutation in the AFF3 . Several new candidate genes were identi ï¬ed. As a result, 21 pathogenic variants, 3 probably pathogenic and 12 variants of unknown signi ï¬cance were found. Conclusions: The total diagnostic value of the exome sequencing is 24% (20% for WES; 29% for CES).

Etiologies are numerous and heterogeneous. We developed since 2005, as part of the Reference Center for ID of Rare Causes, aspeciï¬c multidisciplinary consultation (neurologist, geneti cist and social worker) for adults with ID which main objectives are diagnosis, genetic counseling, management,follow up, phenotypic characterization, evolutionary pro ï¬le and natural evolution of different genetic syndromes in adults. Many adults with ID have no diagnosis because theycould not bene ï¬t from the latest high throughput sequen cing techniques. We focused on adults patients (older than 15 years) with isolated or syndromic ID without diagnosis. These patients were from pediatric departments (40%), adults âmedical departments (30%) (whose neurological departments 20%) or referred from their general practitioneror practitioner of their institution (30%). 222 of these patients underwent high throughput sequencing in trios (patient and 2 parents) consisting in TruSight One genepanel (TS1, 51 trios, Illumina*) or whole exome sequencing (171 trios). We established a diagnosis in 21.6% of them with TS1 and 43% with WES. Whole exome sequencingdiagnosis yield is comparable with series published in literature.

We report on the ï¬rst large, in depth study exploring the economic, psychosocial and potential repro ductive impacts of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for ID. Materials and Methods: A survey instrument was developed to assess quality of life, psychosocial impacts, education, employment, income, wealth, welfare depen dency, living arrangements and family out of pocket costs. Eligible families had WGS. Data on 175 individuals with ID (100 households) has been collected. Results: Preliminary data showed combined costs to the Australian and State Governments, and private households totalled $13.1million per household up to the age of 69.Families bore a signi ï¬cantï¬nancial burden ($4.8million per household) mainly due to lost income and out of pocket expenses. Families were under enormous psychosocialstrain and most carers reported having a poor quality of life. Costs to Governments were $10.7million per household, with the main costs being for special education, residentialcare and welfare. Among the families who have had WGS results returned, 44% have had a diagnosis with a further 12% having a potential diagnosis. Most families wouldconsider using assistive technologies such as prenatal diagnosis and IVF with preimplantation genetic diagnosis in future pregnancies. Conclusions: Families affected by ID experience a sig niï¬cant ï¬nancial and psychosocial burden. This data is important for benchmarking the potential bene ï¬ts of WGS in familial ID. D.

30457,"Genetics Research Centre, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of Nowadays, whole exome sequencing has become a wide spread tool in studying Mendelian disorders. The diagnosticyield is assumed around 25 40% and the negative cases are due to WES limitations. Besides the technical issues such as low coverage in speci ï¬c regions or random failure in hybridization reaction, inaccuracies in different data analysis steps play a signi ï¬cant role. These can be resolved by updates in bioinformatics tools, algorithms, databases and literature, improving the diagnostic yield of at least 10 20% in different studies. Recently, we have published the results of a large cohort of patients presenting intellectual disability in which the diagnostic yield of 54% was achieved. In present study, 172 negative cases from previous cohort were selected aiming to improve diagnosticyield by re sequencing and/or re analysis. So far, the analysis of 68 patients is accomplished of which, the possible causative variant is detected in 12%. These resultsare ascertained through three main strategies. First, extensive clinical follow up, re sampling and re interpretation of previous WES data led to identi ï¬cation of one known and two novel candidate genes; ASPM ,TTI1 andGPR126 . Second; WES reanalysis applying improved algorithms and ï¬ltering strategies in addition to updates of disease causing genes revealed two possible candidates; AKTIP ,MAZ , and two known genes; CDK10 ,FSCN1 . Third; re sequencing revealed another candidate gene; CCDC58 possibly by expanding the coverage. In conclu sion, this project has shown 12% improve in diagnostic yield so far, also introduced ï¬ve possible novel candidate genes and provided a second report for the recently identi ï¬ed genes; CDK10 andFSCN1 .

It can also be categorized as syndromic intellectual disability(S ID) and non syndromic intellectual disability (NS ID). Worldwide prevalence of this disorder is estimated to range from 1% to 3%. Material and Methods: For genomic analyses, homo zygosity mapping was coupled with whole exome sequen cing (WES) whereas immuno ï¬uorescence, confocal microscopy, pulldown assays and mass spectrometry ana lyses were performed for biochemical analyses. Results: We studied a Pakistani family of NS ID and identi ï¬ed linkage regions with a maximum possible LOD score of 2.4 at chromosomes 1, 2, 15 and 21. WES con ducted on DNA of two affected members revealed a mis sense mutation (NM_152379.3:c.112G>A,p. Asp38Asn) in C1orf131 , encoding the uncharacterized protein C1orf131, as a likely cause of ID. The mutation replaces a highlyconserved aspartic acid by asparagine and is predicted to be pathogenic by Mutation Taster and Polyphen 2. We show here that C1orf131 is a novel nucleolar component andrelocates to the chromosomal periphery during mitosis. Mutant primary ï¬broblasts exhibit reduced and distorted nucleoli, micronuclei and misshapen nuclei. Similar effectsare seen upon overexpression of mutant protein or knock down by siRNA. Our data also show that C1orf131 interacts with several nucleolar and centrosomal proteins. Conclusion: We conclude that C1orf131 is a novel gene associated with ID and that its protein product plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of thenucleolus. It is also an essential component for normal brain functions. A. I.A. Khayyat: None. S. M. Baig: None. U. Abdullah: None. E. U. Haq: None. Z. Ali: None. N. A. Malik: None. M. Tariq: None. B.

Recent improvements of new generation sequencing are transforming medical practice. We present the clinical and genetical characteristics of a large cohort of patients suffering from ID and had a trio based whole exome sequencing (WES). Patients and Methods: 818 patients were recruited through clinical genetic and/or neuro pediatric consulta tions. ID was assessed based on neuropsychological testswhen available, DSM 5 classi ï¬cation was used otherwise. Prior to WES, a DNA micro array, a search for Fragile X syndrome and a targeted gene analysis in case of highsyndromic suspicion were performed. If negative, trio based WES was proposed. Molecular results were discussed in multidisciplinary team meetings before feed back to patient. Results: The global diagnostic yield was 42% across all patients (338/818 patients). 41 mutations were found in candidate genes and contributed to their validation as âID genes â, rising the potential diagnostic yield to 47% (379/ 818 patients). Dominant mutations were pre eminent (81%) and most of them were de novo (95%) affecting 224 unique genes. Interestingly, severity of ID had no statistically sig niï¬cant effect on diagnostic rate (mild ID, 66/180, 37% moderate to profound ID, 108/419, 44%, p value , 0.1997). Epilepsy and family history of ID were not iden tiï¬ed neither as cofounding factors (p value ,0.132 and 0.516).

It had been associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, based on its deletion in Potocki Shaffer syndrome (PSS) interval at 11p11.2 and its disruption in three patients with balanced translocations. However, until now, individuals who carry deleterioussequence variants within PHF21A have not been identi ï¬ed. Moreover, the identity of a novel gene underlying hypotonia or neurobehavioral phenotype at 11p11.2remained cryptic. Here, we describe seven individuals who carry heterozygous intragenic sequence variants in PHF21A: a missense variant, which alters the last nucleotide of an exon, four frameshift variants, and two identical nonsense variants. These variants are predicted totrigger nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) or generate a truncated version of PHF21A. This con ï¬rms that haploinsuf ï¬ciency of PHF21A causes not only intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, but also epilepsy, language delay, hypotonia, and neurobehavioral problems. We also found that PHF21A is profoundly expressed inhuman fetal brain and skeletal muscle. This emphasizes the role of PHF21A in early human development, which is consistent with developmental delay, autism, ADHD,epilepsy, and hypotonia observed at an early age in our patients. These ï¬ndings de ï¬nitely provide proof of the pathogenicity of this gene in a syndromic form ofintellectual disability. Furthermore, our studies suggest additional features, in particular autism, which extend the phenotypic spectrum attributable to PHF21A mutations. H. Kim: None. J. A. Rosenfeld: None. D. A.

30461,"Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of,2University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Intellectual disability (ID) as the most prevalent disability in the world and a heterogeneous disease is one of the major unsolved issues in health care. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technol ogy has resulted in an exponential increase in decipheringof novel ID causing genes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) in a part of large cohort study on 404 Iranian consanguineous families with autosomal recessive intellec tual disability (ARID) led to the identi ï¬cation of a novel likely pathogenic missense variant (cT1150C; p. C384R) in RNFT2 gene. This variant is located in highly conserved zincï¬nger domain that may change the protein structure in a way to reduce the zinc 2+afï¬nity to protein active site and consequently leading to possible alteration in the DNAbinding site. To provide functional evidence for the effect of this gene on cognition, we used transgenic Drosophila model. Material and Methods: Using Gal4/UAS genetic tool RNFT2 ortholog gene (CG13605) in Drosophila1394melanogaster was down regulated in the ï¬y brain by RNAi mechanism. Then the impact of this gene manipulation on learning ability and short term memory of the ï¬ies were studied using olfactory conditioning assay. Results: Remarkable decrease in olfactory memory per formance indices were observed in the ï¬ies underwent CG13605 down regulation when compared to control gen otype ( P< 0.05). Conclusion: Ourï¬nding suggested the possible role for RNFT2 in functionality of Drosophila brain in terms of learning and short term memory which support its probable role in inducing human cognitive impairment.

In the ï¬rst family with two affecteds from Pakistan, theIQSEC1 missense segregating variant was (c.1028C>T: p.(Thr343Met)) while in the second family of threeaffecteds from Saudi Arabia, the missense variant was (c.962G>A:p.(Arg321Gln)). Five affected individuals from the two families manifested a similar phenotype thatincludes intellectual disability, developmental delay, short stature, aphasia/speech problems, and hypotonia. Affected individuals with the Arg321Gln biallelic variant also haveearly onset epilepsy. The X linked paralog IQSEC2 has previously been linked with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Mice with a conditional Iqsec1 deletion in cortical neurons exhibited an increased density of dendritic spines with an immature morphology. The Drosophila ortholog of IQSEC1 is schizo(siz). Sizis broadly expressed in CNS and PNS from embryo to adult. RNAi knockdown of sizin neurons does not affect viability, whereas glial speci ï¬c knockdown exhibits severe pupal lethality, suggesting thatsiz has a critical role in glia rather than neurons. The identi ï¬edIQSEC1 missense variants behave as severe loss of function alleles in ï¬y given that ubiquitous expression of human IQSEC1 is toxic to the ï¬y so that we failed to obtain viable ï¬ies, whereas expression of the two missense variants consistently produced viable animals. The pheno typic similarity of the patients in the two families, and the functional experiments in mice and Drosophila suggest that IQSEC1 pathogenic variants cause intellectual disability, developmental delay and shot stature, in the autosomal recessive manner.

It is caused by pathogenicvariants in KCNK9 , which is an imprinted gene located on 8q24.3 and is normally expressed on the maternally inherited chromosome. To date, the small number ofreported cases of KCNK9 imprinting syndrome have been attributed to 3 missense variants. There is no known phenotype associated with a deletion of KCNK9 . Methods and Results: We describe the case of a 5 year old male who presented at age 3 with global developmental delay and dysmorphic features including prominentsupraorbital ridges and a prominent nasal root. A chromo somal microarray revealed a 0.014 Mb deletion on 8q24.3 of uncertain signi ï¬cance, encompassing 1 OMIM gene, KCNK9 . This deletion was maternally inherited. Notably, the proband âs mother had similar dysmorphic features and intellectual disability. It was determined by SNP microarraythat the proband âs mother herself had a de novo maternal deletion on 8q24.3. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst report of a clinically affected mother and child with deletion of the imprinted region 8q24.3, encompassing the gene KCNK9 .

Up to date at least threedistinct XLID syndromes have been described: FG syndrome, Lujan Fryns syndrome (LS) and Ohdo syndrome (OSMKB). In the last years, thanks to the massive use ofnext generation sequencing techniques (NGS) it has been possible to discover at least 13 others MED12 mutations and to expand the phenotype of MED12 related disorders. Here we report three subjects from a large non consanguineous family presenting with a mild to severe ID, important speech delay, behavior problems, dysmorphicfacial features and hearing loss. NGS allows us to detect the MED12 missense variant c.3883C>T (p. R1295C) carried by the three patients. This variant has been reported in 2016 byHuet al in one family from a big cohort of XLID unresolved families. The clinical and phenotypic variability between the patients described by the different authorsthrough the last years is very wide, and it could be explained by the multiple functions of the MED12 protein in complex pathways.

This complex neurodevelopmental disorder is characterized by various phenotypic features including plagiocephaly, strabismus, clubfoot, poor speech,and developmental delay, which are present in our proband.1396Materials and Methods: SNP CGH followed by func tional genome analysis was conducted for the proband. In order to elucidate the pathogenicity of the intragenic MED13L gene deletion, proband âs total blood RNA was isolated and cDNA was synthesized. Subsequently, a quantitative RT PCR using TaqMan gene expression assaysdesigned for MED13L gene was performed. Lastly, MED13L gene was sequenced in patient's cDNA sample by Sanger method. Results: Ade novo 97.88 kb deletion in the cytoband 12q24.21 including 3 rdand 4thexons of MED13L gene was detected. Further quantitative expression analysis of severalMED13L exons disclosed the deletion of exons 3 4 but excluded the deletion of exons 1 2 and 16 17. The borders of the deletion in the coding region were narrowed bySanger sequencing. The deletion spanning from the exon 3 rd to 9thwas determined. In silico , the deletion was predicted to result in truncated protein NP_056150:p.(Val104 Glyfs*5) partly altering Med13_N domain and losing medPIWI and Med13_C domains. Conclusions: Based on these ï¬ndings, heterozygous deletion results in partial haploinsuf ï¬ciency of the MED13L gene in the affected patient due to the premature termination of the protein translation.

Neurochondrin acts as an endogenous modulator of glutamate receptor mGluR5 and in mice, depletion of Ncdn causes epileptic seizures, depressive like behaviors and impaired spatial learning. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1397Material and Methods: We identi ï¬ed a consanguineous Pakistani family segregating mild intellectual disability and seizures in three children. Whole exome sequencing was performed on samples from two affected siblings. Human neuroblastoma line SH SY5Y and CRISPR/Cas9 editing was used to model loss of NCDN in vitro . Results: We identi ï¬ed a rare homozygous NCDN mis sense variant (NM_001014841.1:c.1246G>C) in the three affected family members. Electroencephalography (EEG) oftwo affected siblings revealed epileptic pattern whereas brain MRI was normal. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we then generated NCDN knockout (KO) in SH SY5Y cells. The KO cells exhibited signi ï¬cantly reduced neurite outgrowth as compared to w.t. cells. Neurochondrin modulates the activation of mGluR5 of importance for ERK1/2 phos phorylation and we then examined the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at position threonine 202. The ERK1/2 phosphor ylation was reduced in NCDN KO cells when compared to w.t. SH SY5Y cells. Conversely, phosphorylation increased when NCDN was overexpressed in both w.t. and KO SH SY5Y cells. Conclusion: NCDN loss of function in SH SY5Y cells revealed impaired neurite outgrowth and reduced mGlu5R dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Bainbridge ropers syndrome (BRPS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in ASXL3 . Patients with BRPS show delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, speech alterations, hypotonia, poor growth and dysmorphic features. It is categorized as a syndromic cause of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Nowadays, 33 patients with BRPS have been reported. Our work expands the mutational spectrum of the ASXL3 with the genotype phenotype characterizing 11 new patients. Material and Methods: In a collaborative initiative we have identi ï¬ed 11 patients with neurodevelopmental dis orders and ASD phenotype with loss of function(LoF) mutations in the ASXL3 gene. Exome sequencing was used as a diagnostic tool and Sanger sequencing was used forfamilial segregation. The mutational spectrum of ASXL3 was revised in public_data (PubMed, Clinvar, SFARI). Results: We identi ï¬ed 10 new ASXL3 LoF variants and one recurrent mutation (c.3106C>T;p. Arg1036Ter). The main clinical characteristics of our patients included moderate severe intellectual disability with ASD traits andneuroconductual disorder including aggressively behavior in adolescence. Dysmorphic features highly suggestive of ASXL3 were delineated eyebrows and the skeletal pheno type. So far, 77 different LoF mutations (48 frameshifts, 28 Stop Gain, 1 splicing) have been identi ï¬ed including our present results. There are 3 recurrent mutations and 73unique variants. Conclusions: The inclusion of new patients with BRPS increases the knowledge of mutational spectrum of ASXL3 and is essential to further delineate the phenotype of this syndrome. The recognition of this syndrome in the context of a neurodevelopmental disorder is indispensable for theorientation of molecular diagnosis. Grant: FIS_FEDER_PI16/00369; PERIS SLT002/16/ 00174 I.

30469,"Medical Center, Maastricht, Netherlands,2Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center,Nijmegen, Netherlands Since 2010 whole exome sequencing (WES) discovered a large numbers of novel genes and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), denoted here as ânext generation NDDs â. Yet, ~40% of NDD patients remain undiagnosed. There fore, we previously established a cohort of 826 patients with unexplained ID, a subtype of NDD, for whom trio based WES was performed. ID severity ranged from mild (27%)to severe (27%) and 32.2% of patients had other NDD subtypes. We identi ï¬ed pathogenic variants in known NDD genes in 28.6% of patients and 386 patients (46.7%) had atleast one de novo mutation in a gene not previously associated with NDDs. Between 2014 and 2018, we have so far con ï¬rmed seven of 586 genes as next generation NDD gene ( SON,TLK2 ,RAC1 ,RHEB ,USP9X ,RAB11B ,WAC ). Matchmaking was successful for all but one ( RHEB ), resulting in a maximum of 35 additional patients ( TLK2 ) and underscoring the need for data sharing for next generation NDDs. Additionally, mutations in these genes together only diagnosed ~1% of patients of our initialcohort, illustrating the rarity of next generation NDDs. Of note, for USP9X ,WAC and TLK2 , most patients were mildly affected. Further systematic analysis of our cohortshowed that overall a similar percentage of de novo mutations in known NDD genes was present in patients with mild ID (27.9%) compared to more severe ID (27.2%),indicating that WES should not be restricted to patients with more severe phenotypes. Finally, we observed a challenge to translate the discovered next generation NDDs to clinic. To improve patient care, we propose an organizational model, in which parents have a key role. M. R.F.

30470,"Institute of Human Genetics, Friedrich Alexander UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen NÃ¼rnberg, Erlangen, GermanyNeurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are clinically and genetically extremely heterogeneous. Shared phenotypes are often caused by mutations in genes involved in the same networks, complexes or pathways. Mutations in TCF4, MEF2C, UBE3A, ZEB2 orATRX cause overlapping, syndromic forms of severe NDDs with epilepsy, thussuggesting molecular and functional commonalities. Transcriptome analysis on RNA from patients âperipheral blood (mutations in either TCF4 ,MEF2C ,ZEB2 orATRX ) revealed common transcriptional targets as pairwise com parisons of deregulated genes showed signi ï¬cant overlap. Among these we found enrichment for GO terms such asRNA related and ubiquitin ligase related processes and signiï¬cant enrichment of known NDD associated genes, indicating central roles in neurodevelopment. Next, we screened for genetic interactions in Drosophila melanogaster by inducing ubiquitous or tissue speci ï¬c knockdown or overexpression of each single gene and inpairwise combinations. We assessed parameters such as lethality, wing and eye morphology, neuromuscular junc tion morphology and bang sensitivity and climbing beha viour. We observed robust genetic interaction between Ube3a andMef2 by multiple phenotype modi ï¬cations upon simultaneous dosage manipulation in different tissuesincluding glia, wing and eye. E.g. single overexpression of either Ube3a orMef2 resulted in mild eye phenotypes (rough surface or reduced bristles), respectively, whilecombined overexpression led to a severe eye size reduction and disorganized ommatidia structure, indicating synergistic interaction. Assessment of genes implicated in clinically overlapping NDDs revealed commonly deregulated target genes and genetic interactions between Ube3a andMef2 in the Dro sophila model system, suggesting that such perturbed interactions contribute to the underlying pathomechanisms also in humans.

A large number of novel genes has been identi ï¬ed in the lastAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1399years, however those account for only 50% 70% of all cases. Further, functional workup is essential for precise phenotype de ï¬nition and to understand the underlying disease mechanisms. Materials and Methods: Using exome sequencing (ES), we have analysed a cohort of 100 Iranian individualsaffected by developmental delay/ intellectual disability. Results: While 49% carried causative mutations in genes previously associated with neurodevelopmental disorders inhuman, we identi ï¬ed novel candidate genes in 29%. 22% remained unsolved. Amongst novel genes, we identi ï¬ed MAB21L1 loss of function resulting in cerebellar, ocular, facial and genital features (COFG syndrome) and PPP1R21 loss of function causing hypotonia, neurodevelopmental delay, facial dysmorphism, eye sight loss, loss of whitematter and thinning of the corpus callosum as well as hepatosplenomegaly in some cases. We further established that PPP1R21 was absent in ï¬broblasts of an affected individual and consistent with the subcellular expression pattern and the clinical phenotype exhibiting features of storage diseases, we found patient ï¬broblasts exhibited a delay in clearance of transferrin 488 while uptake was normal. This suggests a role of PPP1R21 within the endo somal sorting process or endosome maturation pathway. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates ES is an ef ï¬cient diagnostic method for neurodevelopmental phenotypes. In addition, we delineate novel neurodevelopmental syn dromes and show that bi allelic PPP1R21 loss of function variants affect the endosomal sorting process or endosome maturation pathway. M.

Onlyseven patients have previously been reported. Here, wepresent ï¬ve new male patients with pathogenic variants in NONO , with several novel features. Methods: All patients were ascertained after routine referral to their local Clinical Genetics service. Samples from three individuals underwent exome sequencing as part of the Wellcome Trust Deciphering Developmental Dis orders study. One patient had whole genome sequencing performed as part of the 100,000 Genomes Project, and one had service trio exome analysis. Results: Four patients had truncating pathogenic variants inNONO , and one splice site. All were maternally inherited. All patients had signi ï¬cant developmental delay and hypotonia. Three required gastrostomy tube placement, which has been reported in only two patients previously. Two had relative macrocephaly. None of the patients in ourseries have left ventricular non compaction. All had abnormal cranial MRI scans. Novel features include peri ventricular leukomalacia, mild aortic root dilatation, andEbstein anomaly. Recognizable shared dysmorphic features include frontal bossing, infra orbital grooves and long ï¬ngers.

Mandel1 1IGBMC, Illkirch Graffenstaden, France,2Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands,3iCube laboratory, Strasbourg, France Introduction: About 50 recurrent CNVs and 800 genes are implicated in genetic forms of intellectual disability (ID) with or without autism (ASD). The extreme heterogeneityof these neurodevelopmental disorders and the rarity of identi ï¬ed cases for many of the implicated genes renders the goal of de ï¬ning the clinical spectrum, comorbidities and natural history a daunting task. We reasoned that a participatory approach would be a relevant alternative and used the Koolen deVries syndrome (KdvS 17q21.31del /KANSL1mut) for a proof of concept.1400Methods and Results: We initiated GENIDA, a partici patory online cohort study for speci ï¬c genetic causes of ID/ ASD ( https://genida.unistra.fr ), whereby clinical informa tion is entered and updated by the family of the proband using a structured online questionnaire currently available in 5 languages, with answers from 650 participatingfamilies. The KdVS cohort is the largest, with 179 partici pating families. Results obtained for the frequency of behavioral problems, epilepsy or other previously reportedcomorbidities are consistent with published data. Our approach allowed us to re ï¬ne frequencies of speci ï¬c man ifestations and their perceived severity. Inclusion of pro bands from a wide age range generates data on natural history. A major ï¬nding is the identi ï¬cation of recurrent respiratory problems in 40% of patients, including asthma(30 cases) and pneumonia (17 cases, mostly before 10y) that appear uncorrelated with reported laryngo/tracheoma lacia or immunologic problems. Conclusion: Data comparisons show that parents of patients can adequately answer the questionnaire, and validate our participatory approach.

The ï¬rst patient showed severe developmental delay, thin corpus callosum (CC), prominent supraorbital ridges withsynophrys, deep set eyes and ï¬eshy earlobes: in order to validate our clinical suspicion of Borjeson Forssman Lehmann syndrome (BFLS), we performed PHF6 muta tional analysis that revealed a de novo missense mutation within the PHD type 2 domain; X inactivation analysis showed skewed X inactivation in blood lymphocytes. The second patient had severe delayed language development, intellectual disability (ID), hypermetropia, strabismus,linear skin hyperpigmentation and increasing obesity: PWS AS test and array CGH resulted normal. Whole exome sequencing (WES), surprisingly, disclosed a de novo missense mutation in PHF6 , in the same functional domain as our ï¬rst patient; in this case, X inactivation analysis showed normal X inactivation in blood lymphocytes. BFLSis an X linked recessive disease, characterized by ID, epilepsy, hypogonadism, hypometabolism, obesity and a typical facial gestalt; female carriers usually not show anyï¬ndings or present only mild symptoms. To date, de novo aberrations in PHF6 were reported in 13 females with a variable phenotype, characterized by ID, characteristicfacial features, ï¬ngers and dental anomalies, only partially overlapping with BFSL as described in males. Molecular genetics has opened a new path to understand thecomplexity of ID, mostly in female patients, where we would tend to exclude a priori a known as X linked recessive condition.

We therefore comprehensively studied the clinical and genetic landscape of an unselected cohort of patients withmicrocephaly. Materials and Methods: We performed clinical assess ment, high resolution chromosomal microarray analysis,exome sequencing and functional studies in 62 patients (58% with primary microcephaly (PM), 27% with second ary microcephaly (SM), and 15% of unknown onset). Results: We found severity of developmental delay/ intellectual disability correlating with severity of micro cephaly in PM, but not SM. We detected causative variantsin 48.4% of patients and found divergent inheritance and variant pattern for PM (mainly recessive and likely gene disrupting (LGD)) versus SM (all dominant de novo andevenly LGD or missense). While centrosome related path ways were solely identi ï¬ed in PM, transcriptional regula tion was the most frequently affected pathway in both SMand PM. Unexpectedly, we found causative variants in different mitochondria related genes accounting for ~5% of patients, which emphasizes their role even in syndromicPM. Additionally, we delineated novel candidate genes involved in centrosome related pathway (SPAG5, TEDC1), Wnt signaling (VPS26A, ZNRF3) and RNA traf ï¬cking (DDX1).

The protein interacts with FMRP and the gene has high constraint to loss of functionvariation (gnomAD: 0 variants observed / 58 expected). Three de novo loss of function PRR12 variants and one translocation disrupting the gene have been reported in theliterature in patients showing global developmental delay, intellectual disability, neuropsychiatric problems, eye and vision abnormalities, dysmorphic features, hypotonia,skeletal abnormalities, sleep problems and anxiety. Three other de novo PRR12 variants have been identi ï¬ed in large studies in additional patients from whom no or only limitedphenotype information is available. We describe a 3 year old boy referred for developmental delay, failure to thrive and congenital hypotonia. His facial features included short forehead, bilateral epicanthal folds, hooded upper eyelids, malar hypoplasia, and borderline small asymmetric low set ears. He also showed anxiety andautistic traits, and had pes planus and tapered digits. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous PRR121402nonsense variant NM_020719.2(PRR12):c.3958C>T, p. (Arg1320*) which was absent from all databases. The facial phenotype was consistent with previously reported cases, except that no signi ï¬cant abnormalities in structure and function of the eyes were present. Our ï¬ndings support the role of PRR12 haploinsuf ï¬ ciency in a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, and show, in accord with several other cases, that the eye phenotype originally described as a part of the typical presentation maybe absent.

Targeted diagnostic methodshave a limited chance to reveal their aetiology. Global ""genotype ï¬rst"" approaches such as exome sequencing (ES) have a better diagnostic yield. However, their results andthe genotype phenotype correlation must be thoroughly revised to prevent misdiagnosis due to the lack of experience with rare conditions. We present four patientswith three such conditions diagnosed by ES. In all cases the neurological impairment was dominant, and dysmorphic and other features were unspeci ï¬c or absent. Patient 1 was a girl with progressive spastic tetraplegia, dysarthria and intellectual disability (ID). ES identi ï¬ed variants p. (Trp1253*) and p.(Lys849*) in ALS2 . Phenotype revision supported the diagnosis of juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (MIM205100). Patient 2 was a girl with short stature,microcephaly, moderate ID, spastic paraplegia, aggressive behaviour and convergent strabismus. ES revealed variants p.(Pro648Ser) and p.(Ile403Thrfs*80) in ALDH18A1 . Her phenotype corresponded to autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 9B (MIM616586). Patients 3 and 4, a sister and brother with similar neurological impairment, showedhypotonia and moderate ID. ES revealed variants p. (Ser893Arg) and p.(Leu311Trp) in PIGN , associated with multiple congenital anomalies hypotonia seizures syndrometype 1 (MIM614080). All three conditions belong to very rare diseases unlikely to be diagnosed solely based on clinical evaluation and targeted testing.

Furthermore, to gain insightAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1403into the role of SETD1A in fundamental learning and memory processes, we studied a Drosophila knock down of the orthologue Set1. The cohort mainly comprised de novo variants that pre dict a loss of function with c.4582 2_4582delAG being a recurrent mutation resulting in intron retention.

SHANK3 codes for a structural protein, which plays a central role inthe formation of the postsynaptic terminals, as well as in the maintenance of synaptic structures. So far, more than 1,200 cases have been already reported; a non speci ï¬c phenotype has emerged including global developmental delay (>98%), absent to severely delayed speech (>98%), severe neonatal hypotonia (>98%), normal to accelerated growth (95%),and minor dysmorphic features, among others. We here present the largest cohort of Spanish patients with PMS; 181 (mainly from Spain (151) and Latin America (30cases). Patients were characterized by means of deep phenotyping, chromosomal microarrays, and other genetic approaches (including MLPA, FISH and Karyotype). Wecompare clinical, genetic and follow up characteristics with previous published series of patients with PMS. In addition, we present clinical molecular data from this cohort; most ofthem, with deletions at 22q13.3 band, including SHANK3 and described 5 new point mutations in this gene associated to PMS. This study set up clinical and laboratory manage ment for the establishment of possible genotype phenotype correlations. Based on our data and other previously published we propose at ï¬rst time a complete laboratory management algorithm to verify all the genetic aspects in PMS individuals and related, as well as a correct genetic counselling.

We provide the results of the functional analysis of a splice site variant c.899 +1G>A in the SLC9A6 gene identi ï¬ed to three affected individuals in one family. Materials and Methods: SCL9A6 gene variant NC_000023.11(NM_001042537.1):c.899 +1G>A was pre viously detected by whole exome sequencing in two affected brothers and their mother. To justify the patho genicity of the variant total blood RNA of one affected malewas isolated, template cDNA was synthesized and sequencing of SLC9A6 gene exons 5 8 was performed by Sanger method. Results: SLC9A6 gene donor splice site variant NC_000023.11(NM_001042537.1):c.899 +1G>A was examined by computational algorithms and predicted toaffect mRNA splicing. Sanger sequencing of cDNA revealed that c.899 +1G>A produces skipping of exon 6. In silico , this leads to a frameshift in cDNA and results in a premature stop codon NP_001036002.1:p.(Val264Alaf sTer3). The truncated protein lacks several transmembrane helices and a C terminal domain. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that SLC9A6 gene splice site variant NC_000023.11(NM_001042537.1):c.899 +1G>A affects mRNA splicing and leads to a truncated protein product, which is the cause of Christianson syn drome in affected family members.

We describe a Portuguesefamily with two siblings presenting similar clinical features caused by compound heterozygous variants in SNX14 .A heterozygous nonsense variant c.1195C>T p.(Arg399*) wasinitially identi ï¬ed by exome sequencing. Due to phenotypic similarity with previously published SCAR20 patients, further investigation led to the identi ï¬cation of the second heterozygous variant c.(612 +1_613 1)_(1171 +1_1172 1) del using targeted quantitative PCR. Reverse transcriptase PCR con ï¬rmed the frameshift r.613_1171del p. (Val205Argfs*47). Breakpoint characterization is underway but preliminary results indicate that the underlying mechanism appears to be Alu induced non allelic homo logous recombination. Our results describe the ï¬rst non consanguineous SCAR20 family carrying compound het erozygous pathogenic variants in the SNX14 . In conclusion, this case emphasizes the role of Sorting nexin 14 in neurodevelopment and cognitive impairment, and high lights the value of detailed clinical evaluation and deepphenotyping to disclose the molecular defect underlying a highly heterogeneous disease such as intellectual disability.

The role of TLK2 in brain is still unknown. Within the Autism Sequencing Con sortium (ASC) project, we identi ï¬ed new patients with variants in the TLK2 gene by whole exome sequencing (WES). Methods: DNA samples from trios were sequenced at the Broad Institute on Illumina HiSeq sequencers as previouslydescribed (De Rubeis et al., 2014); variant calling was performed using a bioinformatics pipeline adapted for dif ferent patterns of inheritance. Results: We identi ï¬ed one patient with a de novo likely pathogenic TLK2 variant (p. Asp529Gly) and a family with three siblings who inherited a nonsense variant from anaffected mother (p. Glu453*). Finally, we report a de novo 39 kb deletion encompassing the TLK2 and MRC2 genes. Clinical phenotypes partially overlapped with known cases:facial dysmorphisms were present in all patients, while intellectual disability and microcephaly were not identi ï¬ed in the patient with the 39 kb deletion, where the skeletalanomalies were predominant.

ID is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous and can be categorized intosyndromic and non syndromic forms. Although next generation sequencing technologies have uncovered more than a thousand underlying genetic causes, many casesremain undiagnosed. From our cohort of patients with varying degrees of ID, we genetically evaluated 26 families whose probands manifested with syndromic intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and brain malforma tions. Likely pathogenic variants in known genes were identi ï¬ed in 57% (15/26), novel genetic causes in 20% (5/ 26) and no pathogenic variants were found in 23% (6/26). For three novel genes of unknown function, matchmaking platforms and multi center collaboration identi ï¬ed an additional 14 families. One novel gene is TMEM94, in which bi allelic truncating variants were identi ï¬ed in 10 probands from 6 families; all had syndromic ID, speechdelay, facial dysmorphisms and congenital heart defects. We have shown that Tmem94 is essential for neurologic and cardiovascular development in mice. We also demon strated that, in human cells, TMEM94 is a novel protein localized in the centrosome, and may very well have important roles involved in cell division and metabolism. Inconclusion, the identi ï¬cation of novel ID genes is facilitated by matchmaking platforms and collaborative interactions.

We report two siblings with a clinical presentation over lapping TRAPPC9 related disorder (MIM #613192). Preg nancy and delivery was uneventful. First medical concernsappeared before one year of age due to hypotonia and poor contact. Patients then developed severe intellectual dis ability with neither independent walking nor speech atcurrent age of 11 and 8 yo. They also had stereotypic hand movements as well as MRI abnormalities, such as thin corpus callosum and cortical atrophy. They had no seizures. Extensive metabolic screening, CGH array and Intellectual Disability gene panel sequencing were normal. Whole exome sequencing revealed that both affected siblings car ried a novel homozygous variant (c.367C>T (NM_016209), p.(Gln123*), hg19:chr16:88926373C>T) in the TRAPPC2L gene. The variant was inherited from heterozygous con sanguineous parents. This is the ï¬rst description of a homozygous loss of function variant in the TRAPPC2L gene. Only biallelic missense variants in TRAPPC2L (*610970) have been previously reported in three patients with global develop mental delay, microcephaly, dystonia, tetraplegia, rhabdo myolysis, encephalopathy and epilepsy (Sacher et al. 2018, Milev et al. 2018). TRAPPC2L (Traf ï¬cking Protein Particle Complex 2 Like) and TRAPPC9 proteins belong to thehuman TRAPPII complex, involved in vesicle traf ï¬cking in the secretory pathway by mediating contacts between vesicles and target membranes. Our ï¬ndings suggest that loss of function variants in these two genes may cause similar phenotypes.

We identi ï¬ed compound heterozygous variants in TRIT1 gene, encoding a protein involved in i 6A37 tRNA modiï¬cation. The purpose of our work was to characterize the clinical and molecular spectrum that result frompathogenic TRIT1 variants. Patients and methods: We used the matchmaking exchange platforms, PhenomeCentral and GeneMatcher to recruit patients with TRIT1 pathogenic variants. Clinical and molecular data were assessed and compared to the four previously published families. Results: We identi ï¬ed three new patients with compound heterozygous variants in TRIT1 gene. All variations were inherited from a healthy parent in heterozygous state. Taking into account published cases, all patients presentedmoderate to severe ID, seizures and severe microcephaly. Cerebral atrophy or dysplasia of corpus callosum could be noted in half of patients. In most of cases, each compoundstate associated one missense and one truncating variation. Loss of function variants, considered as pathogenic, pre sented a mean allele count of 75 in GnomAD database. Allbut one involved variant were reported many times in het erozygous state in GnomAD [range 2 139]. Conclusions: Haplo insuf ï¬ciency of TRIT1 causes an emerging clinical syndrome characterized by moderate to severe ID, microcephaly and epileptic encephalopathy.

30486,"Berlin, Germany Intellectual Disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by signi ï¬cant genetic contribution and heterogeneity. While exome sequencing has revolutionizedthe identi ï¬cation of novel ID genes and pathogenic variants, a huge challenge that remains is the interpretation of the vast number of Variants of Unknown Signi ï¬cance (VUS). A combination of genetic, clinical and functional arguments is essential for best interpreting these VUS. Development of functional tests to characterize VUS effects are important tomake a diagnosis but also to dissect the function of the concerned proteins. We illustrate this question by present ing functional studies performed to reclassify VUS in threeID genes. We ï¬rst looked at expression and localization of mutant proteins by overexpressing them. For NLGN3, we used the unfolded protein response (UPR) as a read out asthe initial pathogenic variants identi ï¬ed was shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum stress. For DYRK1A, which require an autophosphorylation to be activated, we study the abilityof mutant proteins to autophosphorylate themselves. As it was shown that DYRK1A and PQBP1 might regulate gene expression and splicing, we analyzed transcriptomic pro ï¬les in patients âcells or by loss of function of the genes in human neuronal precursors to sort out molecular signatures. We have been able to reclassify two thirds of VUS into thepathogenic categories and we are currently developing novel approaches to characterize the effect of the last third. The better comprehension of mechanisms involved inmonogenic forms of ID and the development of functional tests for missense variants will be useful to improve diagnosis of patients. J.

Materials and Methods: We present data on exome , genome sequencing, and array analysis of thirteen indivi duals that point to pathogenic, heterozygous, mostly de novo variants in WDFY3 (signi ï¬cant de novo enrichment p,0.0007) as a monogenic cause of mild and non speciï¬cN D D . Results: Nine variants were protein truncating and four missense. Overlapping symptoms included NDD, intellec tual disability (ID), macrocephaly, and psychiatric disorders (ASD/ADHD). One proband presented with an opposingphenotype of microcephaly and the only missense variant located in PH domain of WDFY3. Findings of this case are supported by previously published data demonstrating thatpathogenic PH domain variants can lead to microcephaly via canonical Wnt pathway up regulation. We previously reported that Wdfy3 is required for cere bral cortical size regulation in mice, by controlling proper division of neural progenitors. Here, we show that pro liferating cortical neural progenitors of human embryonicbrains highly express WDFY3, further supporting a role in regulation of prenatal neurogenesis. We present data on Wnt pathway dysregulation in Wdfy3 haploinsuf ï¬cient mice, which display macrocephaly and de ï¬cits in motor coordination and associative learning, recapitulating thehuman phenotype. Consequently, we propose that in humans WDFY3 loss of function variants lead to macro cephaly via down regulation of the Wnt pathway. Conclusion: We present WDFY3 as a novel gene linked to mild to moderate NDD and ID and conclude that variants putatively causing haploinsuf ï¬ciency lead to macrocephaly, while an opposing pathomechanism due to variants in PH domain of WDFY3 leads to microcephaly.

We report the simultaneous discovery of three pathogenic variants in KMT2A ,PAX3 , and DLG3 genes, for a 8 year old patient. He has a developmental delay, behavioral disorders, associated dysmorphic features, such telecanthus, blue coloring of the irises and cubital hypertrichosis. A triobased exome sequencing found three deleterious variants: KMT2A: c.9068delA ;p. Gln3023Argfs*3 de novo, PAX3: c.530C>G ;p. Ala177Gly de novo and DLG3: c.127delG ;p. Asp43Metfs*22 hemizygous inherited from the mother. KMT2A mutations are involved in Wiedemann Steiner syndrome, and PAX3 mutations are responsible for Waardenburg syndrome. DLG3 mutations are described in a non syndromic X related intellectual disability. This frameshift variant is located on the speci ï¬ce x o n1o f transcript NM_020730.2 of DLG3 mostly expressed in brain. Considering the dysmorphic features and intellectual disability presented by this patient, these three variants weretherefore imputed as pathogenic and their association responsible for his phenotype. Several multiple molecular diagnosis were already found by WES. Yang et al. reported dual diagnosis on 4 patients (6%) [1], Posey et al. within 6 patients (7%)[2], and Rossi &a l. within 4 patients (9.5%) [3]. However none triple diagnosis has been reported in literature.

Whole exome sequen cing (WES) becomes the most ef ï¬cient test to identify disease causing variants in monogenic disorders. Aim: Topromote the identi ï¬cation of disease genes through WES,hence to estimate the diagnostic yield of WES and to select novel candidate genes for future functional studies. Materials and Methods: The institutional ethics com mittee approved this study. 168 patients (104 families) with neurodevelopmental disorders were enrolled and all eval uated by clinical geneticists. For WES; DNA was barcodedand enriched using Agilent SureSelect V6 60 MB and sequenced using HiSeq4000 or NovaSeq6000. Raw data and Variant Calling Files (VCF) processing and annotationwas carried out at the Department of Genetics, SQU. Results: A database of clinical phenotypes for 104 families was established. In house pipeline for ï¬ltration and prioritization of WES data was standardized and validated. Prioritized variants found were as following 1) disease causative variants (de ï¬nite cause) in 21/104 families (20%), 2) possible disease causing variants (VUSs) with supportive segregations results in 28 families (27%), and 3) variants in novel genes (new genes not implicated in human diseasebefore) in 19/104 families (18%). While in 36 families (35%), we detected no abnormality. Conclusion: the diagnostic rate achieved in our cohort is 20% when considering pathogenic variants only and up to 47% with VUSs. Nineteen candidate genes that are con vincing to be causative of neurodevelopmental syndromesidenti ï¬ed. Further functional studies to be completed to conï¬rm causation. G. Al Kasbi: None. F.

Acquired somatic mutations in BCORL1 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of1410several malignancies, but germline mutations of BCORL1 have not been associated with a speci ï¬c genetic syndrome. However, a hemizygous variant, c.2459A>G [p.(Asn820 Ser)] in BCORL1 was reported in 2 brothers with severe intellectual disability, coarse facial features, and hypotonia previously. Materials and Methods: Five individuals from 3 pedi grees with phenotypes including intellectual disability, behavioral dif ï¬culties, and dysmorphic features were investigated by whole exome sequencing. Our case series was built via collaborations assisted by GeneMatcher. Results: Three missense variants c.2345 T>A, c.1487 C>T and c.95C>T were observed in hemizygous state in BCORL1 . Two of the three BCORL1 variants, c.95C>T [p. (Pro32Leu)] and c.1487C>T [p.(Ser496Phe)] are notreported in gnomAD and the third variant, c.2345T>A [p. (Val782Glu)] is reported in one individual in hemizygous state. The amino acids, proline at 32nd and serine at 496thposition are highly conserved with a GERP score of 5.42 and 5.69 respectively. The amino acid, valine at 782th is moderately conserved with a GERP score of 2.7. Conclusions: Hemizygous pathogenic variants in BCORL1 underlie a new X linked epigenetic syndrome of variable degrees of intellectual disability, seizures, beha vioral abnormalities, and dysmorphisms including tall forehead, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral ï¬ssures, and long ï¬ngers. This newly described syndrome should be considered in males with the above described features, especially in the setting of an X linked familial inheritance pattern. A. Shukla: None. K. M.

Our objective was toshed light on the phenotype and inheritance pattern of this unique microdeletion. Methods: Cases with deletions involving the 13q33.1 q34 cytoband were retrieved using local databases of two largest Israeli centers performing CMA analysis. In addi tion, literature search in PubMed database and DECIPHER database was performed. Results: Local database search yielded eight new patients with 13q33.3 q34 microdeletions, three of which had additional copy number variants. Combined with 15 cases detected by literature search, and additional 23 casesreported in DECIPHER database, overall 43 patients with isolated 13q33.3 q34 microdeletions are described. Devel opmental delay and/or intellectual disability were noted inthe vast majority of affected individuals (93.2%), and in all cases extending beyond the 13q34 cytoband (n ,27). Of the 20 deletions involving the 13q34 cytoband only, in threecases developmental delay and/or intellectual disability was not reported. Interestingly, in two of these cases (66.7%) the deletions did not involve the terminal CHAMP1 gene, as opposed to 3/17 (17.6%) of patients with 13q34 deletions and neurocognitive disability. Facial dysmorphism and microcephaly were reported in about half of the cases, whileconvulsions and heart anomalies were noted in one ï¬fth of the patients. None of the 13q33 q34 deletions were inher ited from a reported healthy parent. Discussion: 13q33 q34 microdeletions are associated with high risk for neurodevelopmental disability.

30493,"Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, IsraelBackground: ADCY5 Related Dyskinesia is a diverse group of movement disorders, characterized by dystonia,myoclonus or chorea, with variable disability. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, recently two siblings with generalized dystonia andmyoclonus have been reported, associated with compound heterozygous mutations in ADCY5 gene. Patient: We describe girl, born to consanguineous par ents ( ï¬rst cousins) following an uneventful delivery at term. At the age of 1 year and 9 months she presented a severe global developmental delay, and was unable to speak, sit orstand. Her neurologic examination showed markedly increased tonus and episodic dystonic postures in trunk, extremities and face, exacerbated by voluntary movement. In addition, spontaneous events of ocular convergence spasm and orofacial dystonia were observed. However, during sleep a signi ï¬cant decrease in the tonus was noted, with ï¬ll range of joint movements. She had recurrent epi sodes of hyperthermia and hyperhidrosis. Magneticresonance imaging was suggestive of delayed myelination, and metabolic workup was non directive. Results: Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous c. 1406G>A (p. Ser469Asn) mutation in the ADCY5 gene (OMIM 600293). The variant was not found in GnomAD or ExAC browsers, was classi ï¬ed as dama ging/disease causing by in silico prediction programs, and the residue Ser469 was shown to be highly conserved throughout evolution. Both parents, reported as healthy,were found to be heterozygous carriers.

Affected by genetic factors, genome wide associa tion studies (GWAS) have identi ï¬ed multiple loci asso ciated with alcohol consumption. To quantify the prognostic information of this polygenic burden, we derived apolygenic risk score (PRS) for alcohol consumption and tested its association with alcohol use disorder, alcohol related morbidities and mortality. We created 21 major alcohol induced health events using nationwide hospital discharge, cause of death and pre scription drug purchase registries. Using the largest GWASsummary statistics on alcohol consumption (GSCAN, n,527,282 non Finns), we built a genome wide PRS and tested its prediction on alcohol related events in prospectivecohorts (total n ,39,243).1412Per 1SD increase, the PRS was associated with a 11.2g (0.93 drinks) increase in weekly alcohol intake (95% CI,9.85 12.58g, p ,2.3*10 58) and a 27% increase in alcohol induced events (cases ,874, HR ,1.27,1.19 1.36, p,1.7*10 12) while the difference between the risk of the lowest and highest PRS quintiles was 102% (HR ,2.02, 1.62 2.52, p ,5.4x10 10). Controlling for self reported alcohol consumption estimate, socioeconomical status, smoking, and GGT, this increase was 17%/SD (1.17, 1.09 1.25, p ,8.9*10 6). For DSM IV AUD, a similar increase was observed (cases ,713, OR ,1.20, 1.11 1.31, p,2.29*10 5). Adding the PRS over age and sex increased the C index 2% (p ,0.017) and self reported consumption and socioeconomic factors increased the C index further by 13% (p ,3.1*10 11) with the C index for a model including all being 84.9%. In conclusion, increased polygenic risk for alcohol con sumption was associated with alcohol related morbiditiesalso when controlling for self reported alcohol consumption and other covariates thus showing potential in utilizing genetic information for prediction of alcohol related harms.

Bigger sample sizes, simultaneous measurements and detailed data on disease severity is lacking. Materials and Methods: ALS patients (n ,99) were staged based on the King âs clinical staging system (Stage I IV.). mtDNA copy numbers and telomere lengths were measured with real time PCR technique. Results: Stage I ALS patients have an average telomere length of 200.6 (kB) (SD: 69.5), mtDNA copy number of 300.3 (SD: 90.3), while stage II telomere length is 164.9 (SD: 77.9) and mtDNA copy number is 280.7 (SD: 85.9)and stage III telomer lengths is 114.1 (SD: 40.5) whilemtDNA copy number is 256.5 (SD: 93.9). We did not have any stage IV patients. Conclusions: Both telomere length and mitochondrial copy number decreased with disease severity.

Despite the high genetic heritability, a large proportion of the risk has not been explained thus far. A considerable proportion of the missing heritability is likely to be accounted for by rare, low frequency and functional variants.

Methods: We are currently sequencing a large cohort of both EOAD (2000 individuals) and LOAD patients (3000) and healthy elderly controls (1100). WES is performed using Illumina HiSeq 4000 at a median coverage 40x. TheGATK pipeline is utilised for variant discovery. The quality control and statistical analyses are performed within the Hail framework. We will perform single variant associationanalyses as well as gene burden analyses.

Homozygosity for the Æ4 allele increases AD risk, with homozygotes estimated having up to 60 70% lifetime risk (penetrance), withaverage age of onset ~70 years. Some Æ4 homozygotes live >75 without AD, suggesting protective factors, yet are rarely ascertained. We sought to test APOE haplotypes against cognitive function/dementia in a longitudinal study and identify Æ4 homozygotes aged >75 years without AD. Methods: We sequenced 13,131 healthy elderly partici pants in the ASPREE study. At baseline, participants had no history of cardiovascular disease or dementia, and passed a general cognition screen (Modi ï¬ed Mini Mental State Examination â¥78), average age 74 years. We administered different cognitive tests (general cognition, verbal learning/ memory, verbal ï¬uency, processing speed) over ï¬ve years. We collected clinical outcome data on a range of endpoints, and associated each APOE haplotype with speci ï¬c cogni tive functions and dementia. Results: APOE frequencies aligned with other cohorts (Æ3/Æ3,62.3%, Æ3/Æ4,21.0%, Æ2/Æ3,12.5%, Æ2/ Æ2,0.6%, Æ4/Æ4,1.5%).

According to the World Alzheimer âs Report 2018, 50 million people are living with dementia and its total estimated cost is US$1 trillion worldwide. This poses a signi ï¬cant burden to the aging population. Previous studies have identi ï¬ed genes that increase the risk of the late onset form of the disease (LOAD). Amongthem CR1, a gene encoding a receptor in the complement system. By sequencing of exomes of Spanish family members affected by AD, we identi ï¬ed a novel variant of CR1 gene encoding for a truncated protein caused by a single nucleotide variant (SNV). Allele speci ï¬c PCR revealed the presence of this SNV in 3 members of thefamily, affected by AD but not the unaffected member nor 192 controls examined nor any public database. These results together with the implication of the gene in the disease, indicates possible pathogenic signi ï¬cance. Plasmid constructs of two most common isoforms and the novel variant of CR1 fused with Flag epitope were used in an assay to determine whether the variant mRNA is degraded by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Also whether, if translated, the stability of the protein is affected. Pre liminary results suggest the novel variant in CR1 is degra ded by NMD as the inhibition of this pathway increases the levels of CR1 mRNA and protein.

ABCA7 was initially associated with late onset Alzheimer âs disease (AD) in genome wide association studies. PTC mutations are predicted to lead to loss of functional protein though active transcript rescue was observed. Materials and Methods: Targeted resequencing of the ABCA7 coding region or whole exome sequencing were used to determine the frequency of ABCA7 PTC mutations in 757 EOAD patients (mean onset age 61.2Â±7.0 years) and 757 control individuals. Clinicopathological characteristics of mutation carriers were retrospectively reviewed. Results: We identi ï¬ed 13 different ABCA7 PTC muta tions in 34 carriers (34/757, 4.49%) and 15 PTC mutations in controls, resulting in an OR of 2.33 (95% CI [1.26 4.31],p,0.006). Carriers had a mean onset age of 61.6Â±5.8 (48 70) years. Clinical presentation was predominantly amnes tic. A positive ï¬rst degree familial history was present in 88.8% (16/18). Neuropathological examination (n ,5) showed hallmark AD lesions, in 80% (4/5) combined with pronounced cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Missensemutations were enriched in patients versus controls (OR of 2.20, 95% CI [1.06 2.85], p ,0.028). Conclusion: PTC mutations in ABCA7 are relatively frequent in Belgian EOAD patients, particularly in familial EOAD. Clinical and neuropathological data exhibited a classical AD phenotype in combination with CAA andhighly variable onset ages. Additional information of mutation frequency and spectrum as well as biological impact is essential before implementation into clinicalpractice, including genetic testing and risk prediction. L.

It has one of the highest mortality rates of all psychiatric disorders and psychological and pharmacologi cal treatments show only limited effect. Materials and Methods: As an international collabora tion between the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative andthe Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, we performed the worldwide largest genome wide association study (GWAS) amassing 16,992 AN cases and 55,525 controls. Secondaryanalyses included chromosome conformation capture (i.e., Hi C), linkage disequilibrium score regression, generalised summary data based Mendelian randomisation (GSMR),gene, and gene set analysis using MAGMA. Results: The GWAS identi ï¬ed 8 independent loci and estimated its common genetic variant heritability to be 11 17%, indicating a polygenic trait. Enrichment analyses implicate central nervous tissues and cell types in AN. Additionally, AN showed positive genetic correlations withobsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, r g,.45), major depressive disorder (r g,.28), and anxiety (r g,.25), mirroring its clinical comorbidity pro ï¬le. Surprisingly, bidirectional GSMR a showed signi ï¬cant bidirectional relationship between AN and BMI ( Î²;;;;; ANâBMI, 0.20; OR BMIâAN,0.96), indicating that genomic variants that predispose to lower body mass may also increase liability for AN. Complementing these ï¬ndings, we also reported genomic overlap between AN and metabolic traits, such asfasting insulin concentrations (r g, .24) as well as high density lipoprotein concentrations (r g,.21). Conclusions: Through these ï¬ndings, we are encoura ging a reconceptualization of AN as both a psychiatric and metabolic disorder.

30501,"I. Terczy Åska, E. Obersztyn, B. Nowakowska Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Epilepsy is one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system affecting about 1% of the human population. The causes of epilepsy, because of the clinical and etiological heterogeneity, often remainunknown. However, it is well known that genetic factors are responsible for epilepsy in 40 60% cases. Recent studies have shown that in addition to the point mutations, the copynumber variants (CNVs) are also important factors in this disorder. Materials and Methods: We used array CGH method in a group of 54 patients with the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental abnormalities with or without dysmorphic features. Array CGH analysis was performedusing genome wide microarray with average resolution of 30 kb (180K, Oxford Gene Technology) with speci ï¬cally designed coverage for over 212 selected genes, known orcandidate to play an important role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Results: Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 20 CNVs in 17 patients (31%). All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size, ranging from 1.7 kb to 3.84 Mb, and therefore could not have been detected by standardkaryotype analysis. We identi ï¬ed 6 pathogenic or poten tially pathogenic CNVs (11%) and 14 CNVs with unknown clinical signi ï¬cance (26%). 10 CNVs (50%) could not have been detected by our clinical microarray (60K, OGT). Conclusions: The results of our studies further support the role of submicroscopic CNVs in the etiopathogenesis ofepilepsy and demonstrate the usefulness of array CGH in the genetic diagnosis of this neurodevelopmental disorder.

Carroll3 1Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, 2Helsinki University, Helsinki, Finland,3St. George's, University of London, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Despite available genetic testing, a large proportion of all documented ataxia cases remain geneti cally uncharacterized. Childhood onset ataxias are clinicallyand genetically heterogeneous, which makes ï¬nding the molecular diagnosis challenging. The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic background of childhood onsetataxias in Finland using WES technology. Methods: Our cohort includes all pediatric patients with ataxia as the primary symptom of disease evaluated inHelsinki University Central Hospital during the years 1999 2016. Patients with acute, infection related ataxias, ataxias that follow brain insult and patients with mild ataxia as aminor part of a disorder were excluded. 42 families lacked a genetic diagnosis and were investigated using WES. Results: A pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation was found for 17 families (40 %). Known or novel autosomal recessive variants were found in known ataxia genes HIBCH, STUB1, ADCK3, B9D1, CLN5, PTRH2, TPP1 aswell as in the novel ataxia gene SQSTM1, encoding autophagy receptor p62, we reported recently. De novo or dominant variants explained approximately a third ofgenetic causes in our cohort, with variants identi ï¬ed in EBF3, ITPR1, NKX2 1 and ATP1A3. A de novo variant was identi ï¬ed in MED23, which has not previously been linked to ataxia. Conclusions: WES is an effective way to diagnose patients with known and novel causes of childhood onsetataxia, and enables early diagnosis, which is critical for patients with treatable forms of genetic ataxia and for genetic counselling. Furthermore, our ï¬ndings expand the genetic spectrum of childhood onset ataxias and highlight novel cellular mechanisms. E. Ignatius: None. P. Isohanni: None. M. Pohjanpelto: None. E. Palin: None.

Methods: Clinical assessments, next generation sequen cing, transcript and immunohistochemistry analyses wereperformed Results: The patients presented with poor balance, developmental delay during the ï¬rst year of age and suf fered from intellectual disability from early childhood. They showed oculomotor apraxia, slurred and explosive speech, limb and gait ataxia, exaggerated deep tendon re ï¬ex, dys tonic posture and mirror movement in their hands. They developed mild cognitive abilities. Brain magnetic reso nance imaging in the index case revealed cerebellar atrophy. Next generation sequencing revealed a homozygous synonymous variant in MRE11 (c.657C>T, p. Asn219 ,) that we show affects splicing. A complete absence ofMRE11 transcripts in the index case suggested nonsense mediated mRNA decay and immunohistochemistry con ï¬rmed the absence of a stable protein. Conclusions: Despite the critical role of MRE11A in double strand break repair and its contribution to the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex, the absence of MRE11A iscompatible with life. H. Tajsharghi: None.

Porto, Porto, Portugal The correct interpretation of biological consequences of variants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VUS) on splicing poses a major challenge for clinical geneticists in molecular diagnosis. In silico tools can be used to predict the functional impact of a given VUS; however, softwarelimitations have not been properly evaluated and ï¬nal conï¬rmation requires further molecular studies. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the functional impact of two novelVUSs (intronic c.1580 18C>G in ATP8A2 and synonymous c.6819G>T in NIPBL ) on splicing, by a minigene assay, and compare the observed effects with the predictionsobtained through bioinformatics tools. Minigene constructs were generated through PCR ampli ï¬cation, from patientÂ´s DNA, of genomic sequences surrounding the VUS ofinterest, which were cloned into the pCMVdi vector. Altered splicing was evaluated by PCR and Sanger sequencing of cDNA obtained from HEK293T cellsexpressing the minigene constructs. This strategy showed that both variants produced aberrant transcripts. The c.1580 18C>G homozygous variant in ATP8A2 leads to the retention of 17bp of intron 17, by the use of an alternative acceptor splice site, resulting in a premature termination codon in the predicted protein sequence. The NIPBL variant, c.6819G>T, leads to a deletion of 137bp in exon 40, through activation of an exonic cryptic donor splice site, also resulting in a premature termination codon. Thisallowed us to clearly classify these VUS as disease causing, conï¬rming the bioinformatics prediction of their functional impact. Furthermore, this work denotes the importance ofconsidering intronic and synonymous variants as a way of increasing the molecular diagnosis rate. D. Santos: None. J. DamÃ¡sio: None. S. Morais: None.

KatayamaRitsumeikan university, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X linked dominant inheritance disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Mutations in Methyl CpG binding protein2 (MECP2), Cyclin dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) and Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) have been associated with classic and/or variant RTT. This study was conducted toidentify the responsible gene(s) in atypical RTT patient, and to examine the effect of the mutation on protein function. DNA sequence analysis showed a novel heterozygousmutation in CDKL5 identi ï¬ed as c.530A>G which resulted in an amino acid substitution at position 177, from tyrosine to cysteine. We demonstrated in vitro kinase assay using radioisotope (RI) of mutant protein showed impairment of its activity. The results suggested the mutant CDKL5 was responsible for the disease. Next, pathogenic point mutations including Y177C are mostly observed within the catalytic domain of CDKL5, therefore loss of catalytic activity may be related to diseaseonset. However, this hypothesis has rarely been demon strated. We develop an ef ï¬cient method for detecting CDKL5 activity. Appropriately, CDKL5 underwent autop hosphorylation following expression in Escherichia coli , with autophosphorylated CDKL5 detected as a band shift by phos tag SDS PAGE, without enzyme puri ï¬cation and RI. We tried to examine the effect of 15 pathogenic or likely pathogenic or uncertain signi ï¬cant mutations on their activity, we found all variants showed dramatically reducedcatalytic function. Thus, the protocol is useful for examin ing the relationship between disease causing mutations and their activity. T. Inazu: None. S. Katayama: None.",2019
30504,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is neurological and developmental disorder that begins earlyin childhood and lasts throughout a person's life, character ized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and non verbal communication. Large genome rearrangements are being identi ï¬ed in ASD as an under lying cause for development of this syndrome. These rearrangements are mostly deletions, but duplications canbe found. We present case of twin boys with APBA2 gene duplication. Materials and Methods: Twin boys, age 9 were referred to genetic counseling and testing with diagnosed ASD (DSM IV). DNA was isolated from buccal swabs of the boys, and 3 ml of whole blood from parents. Parents pro vided completed questionnaires for tick disorders in chil dren as well as Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ). Identi ï¬cation of mutations was made with MLPA (multiplex ligase dependent probe ampli ï¬cation) technique, with MLPA kits P343 and P339 (Mrc Holland). Results: All samples were typed successfully. We iden tiï¬ed de novo APBA2 gene duplication in both twins. This gene, located on 15q13.1 locus is already associated with autism features. DCDQ scores are similar in twins withindication of DCD. Assessment of the Questionnaires for tick disorders in children revealed that one sibling is com pletely absent for ticks while other has high score for sec tion related to vocal and involuntary ticks. Conclusions: This ï¬nding require further investigation and follow up on spatial and temporal differences in autismassociated traits in APBA2 gene duplication associated autism. N.

Materials and Methods: For this study we used MLPA P245 Microdeletion Syndromes for screening of the most common microdeletion syndromes and MLPA P036 Sub telomeres Mix 1 for screening of subtelomeric deletions/duplications in 198 patients with autism spectrum disorders. To con ï¬rm alternations discovered with MLPA P036 Subtelomeres Mix 1 we used MLPA P070 SubtelomeresMix 2B. Results: We identi ï¬ed 12 autistic patients with sub microscopic aberrations. There were 2 patients with sub telomeric deletion at the 14q and 2q regions respectively. Two patients had the same deletion at the 1p36.33 region. One patient had a submicroscopic deletion at the 6q regionand duplication at the 13q region simultaneously. Two patients had the submicroscopic deletions at the 4q region. Three duplications were detected at 3p, 9p, and 17p11.2regions. Two patients were with deletion at the 8p and 22q11.21 regions respectively.

ASD risk hasbeen associated with early exposure to various xenobiotics that are cleared in the liver by Cytochrome P450 enzymes. We therefore explored the hypothesis that variants in CYP450 genes, which de ï¬ne the rapid or slow metabolizer status of their carriers, may render individuals exposed to certain toxicants more susceptible to brain disruption during early development. To identify rare variants in 57 CYP450 genes we inspected exome sequence data, from publiclyavailable ASD datasets, for loss of function (LoF) and missense Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) predicted to be detrimental by in silico tools (MAF<5%), as well as rare (<1%) Copy Number Variants (CNVs). In 2674 ASD subjects, we found 516 LoF and missense SNVs, targeting 54CYP450 genes, most frequently in CYP2A13 ,CYP1A1 , CYP2D6 and CYP4B1 . Additionally, we identi ï¬ed 135 CNVs targeting 24 CYP450 genes in 3030 ASD indivi duals. CYP2D6 was exclusively targeted by CNVs in 13 out of 3030 ASD subjects, while CYP4X1 was signi ï¬cantly more frequently targeted by CNVs in ASD cases (22/3030; 0.72%) than controls (2/9649; 0.02%). CYP2D6 metabo lizes most psychoactive drugs, while CYP1A1 acts on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and CYP4X1 is involved in the metabolism of endocrine disrupting chemi cals (e.g. phthalates and bisphenol A). Early exposure to neurotoxic phthalates, bisphenol A and PAHs has been previously associated with ASD risk, and here we provideevidence for an effect of gene environmental exposure interaction mediated by CYP450 gene variants.

The nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway is essential to control mRNA quality and has an important role in the regulation of thetranscriptome. Mutations in genes involved in the NMD pathway, such as the UPF3B gene, a core component of this pathway, were previously linked to ASD. In this study weexplored the potential role of other NMD factors in ASD. We generated a list of 153 genes involved in the NMD pathway using AmiGO, Reactome and a systematic litera ture review. To identify potentially pathogenic variants in the NMD genes, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data (WES) data from 1338 ASD subjects. We also searched forCopy Number Variants (CNVs) targeting NMD genes in ASD patients (n ,3570) and checked their frequency in controls (n ,9649). We identi ï¬ed 43 high impact variants in 28 NMD genes, including the UPF3B and ACE, two genes previously implicated in ASD. Importantly, 11 were novel candidategenes that carry loss of function and missense (deleterious and damaging) variants with a frequency of 1 to 5% in this ASD dataset. Additionally, 5 NMD genes were found to betargeted by CNVs in 12 ASD subjects but none of the controls.

Nowakowska1 1Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland, 2MEDGEN, Warsaw, Poland Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a heterogenous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by problems in social interaction and communication as well as thepresence of repetitive and stereotyped behaviour. It is estimated that the prevalence of ASD is 1 2% in general population with the average male to female ratio 4 5:1. Research studies have shown that clinically relevant CNVs (copy number variants) invisible in karyotype analysis are detected in 7 14% of patients with idiopathic ASD. We elected to use oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its ef ï¬cacy for identi ï¬cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 275 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients â genomes were performed using exon focused, high resolution (180k) array design covering relevant 227genes for autism research. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 71 non polymorphic CNVs in 63 out of 280 (22.5%) patients withASD. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 24 (8.6%) patients, whereas CNVs with unknown clinical signiï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in 41 (18.2 %) of cases. All of the identi ï¬ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size (between 15 kb and 3.1 Mb) and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Due to highresolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 24 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k).

Individual responses to SSGT vary and limited clinical predictors exist for the treatment. Material and Methods: Therefore, we performed a detailed genetic characterization using genotyping, CNV calling and exome sequencing of autistic individuals from one of the largest randomized clinical trial for SSGT andanalyzed the association between genetic factors and SSGT treatment outcome. Identi ï¬ed rare copy number variations (CNVs) were prioritized and polygenic risk score (PRS)was calculated from ASD, education attainment (EA) and attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on different p value thresholds (Pt < 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1). Results: Individuals who carried large CNVs (> 500kb) showed signi ï¬cant worse outcome at 12 weeks post treatment ( Î²,15.4, p ,0.017) and 3 months follow up (Î²,14.2, p ,0.028). In addition, inferior outcomes were implicated for individuals with higher PRS for ASD (Pt , 0.5:Î²,6.5, p,0.018) and ADHD (Pt 1.0: Î²,6.7, p, 0.015) at follow up treatment. Currently, we are analyzing exome sequencing data from the same 205 individuals and then combining different rare and common genetic variantdata carriers together. Conclusion: Autistic individuals with higher genetic burden for the disorder, including large rare CNVs andhigher load of PRS, have different bene ï¬ts of SSGT com pared with individuals with lower genetic risk.

This release was below the lower limit of controls in >75% of ASD subjects, but uniquely high in an 18 year old autistic female at a level farexceeding the upper limit of controls, nearing levels obtained with ionomycin, an ionophore. To assess the molecular basis of this ï¬nding, we com pleted a transcription analysis to compare expression levels of calcium signaling related genes in ï¬broblast derived RNA from this subject to those of two controls and twotypical autism cases. The subject âs transcriptome showed increased expression (>5sd) of genes including the ATP2A3 calcium pump and purinergic receptors, and extremely lowexpression (>24sd) of VDAC2, a mitochondrial calcium uptake channel. These ï¬ndings corroborate suggestions of mitochondrial dysfunction in her clinical biochemicalassays and are extended with Seahorse XFp assays. R. L. Nguyen: None. P. Flodman: None. M. Smith: None.

30511,"Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of Autism Spec trum Disorder (ASD) has hindered the establishment of genotype phenotype associations. Herein, we presented a novel approach that integrates semantic similarity andunsupervised machine learning methods to dissect the ASD genotypic heterogeneity and to identify phenotypic mani festations of ASD genetic variants. This approach wasapplied to copy number variants (N ,6650), disrupting 3998 genes from 1119 ASD patients. Functional similarities among genes were computed using Resnik semanticsimilarity measure. Semantic similarity score, ranging from 0 to 1 represents the functional similarity between two genes, where 1 represents identical genes while score 0reï¬ects functionally dissimilar genes. Agglomerative hier archical clustering of the computed gene similarity matrix identi ï¬ed four different clusters of functionally related genes. Silhouette analysis indicated that clusters were compact and consistent (average Silhouette value ,0.31). The genes (N ,519) of cluster 1 was more relevant to ASD as they were enriched for Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (adjusted p value ,0.00001) and Axon guidance (adjusted1422p value ,0.02) pathways, which are known to be strongly associated with ASD. Cluster 1 genes were also most signiï¬cantly enriched for Schizophrenia Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term, which is a co occurring condition with ASD. The other three clusters were not enriched for ASD related HPO terms. The results indicated thatphenotypic genotypic associations can established for ASD by reducing its genotypic heterogeneity i.e. clustering of functionally similar genes. However, to associate theseclusters with phenotype, further efforts are required to enrich HPO resource. (Grant reference: PTDC/CCI BIO/ 28685/2017) A. C.G. IlhÃ©u: None. M. Asif: None. F. M.

CASK , located on Xp11.4, plays a role in neuronal differentiation andsynapse function. The molecular consequences of CASK mutations have not been studied in human neurons. Our project aims to elucidate the downstream effects of differentCASK mutations using patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Materials and Methods: Skin cells from two patients, one female with severe MICPCH and one male with autism, with different CASK mutations were programmed to iPSCs and further differentiated to functional neurons. Bulk andsingle cell RNA sequencing was performed to identify molecular phenotypes and guide morphological and func tional assessment of neuronal pathology in comparison withcontrol iPSCs. Results: A splice site mutation in the ASD patient decreases wild type CASK mRNA and a tandem duplica tion of two CASK exons is expressed in the MICPCH patient. The mutations reduce CASK protein levels indifferentiating neurons. Transcriptome analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle and single cell RNA sequencing indicated an imbal ance in excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations. Conse quently, we study synapse morphology and spontaneous ï¬ring rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, we observed neuron subtype speci ï¬c upregulation of WNT signaling pathway components. Conclusions: We provide strong evidence that CASK mutations lead to perturbed neurotransmission through dysregulation of synapse vesicle traf ï¬cking and differential distribution of neuronal populations.

Sleep is disturbed in upto 80% of affected youths with ASD. Genes underlying the circadian rhythm are proposed to elucidate sleep and other timing problems in individuals with ASD.

Material and Methods: We used microarray data from probands with ASD (n ,2926) and their unaffected siblings (n,2434) from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). CNVs were called, validated, and subsequently ï¬ltered using established pipelines and detection algorithms (PennCNV, QuantiSNP, SnipPeep). Results: Fisher âs exact test reveal that CNVs encom passed in core circadian clock genes, circadian pathway genes, and sleep trait candidate genes are signi ï¬cantly overrepresented in probands with ASD in comparison totheir unaffected siblings (p ,0.003; Odds ratio 1.6; CI95% [1.2 ; 2.3]).

Due to its diverse functions, nucleolin âs role has been frequently implicated in pathological processes, including cancer and viralinfection. Here, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshifting indel mutation, p. Gly664Glufs*70 through whole exome sequen cing of an autism spectrum disorder trio.. Materials and Methods: We transfected mammalian cells with GFP tagged constructs encoding either A. wildtype nucleolin; B. mutant nucleolin with the same C terminal sequence predicted for the autism proband; C. truncation at Gly664. We co stained with nucleophosmin antibodies to show co localization. Real time ï¬uorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study effects on kinetics/binding dynamics. Results: we have shown that mutant nucleolin mis localizes from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, a construct with a nonsense mutation at the same residue, p. Gly664*, shows a very similar effect on the location of the NCL protein, thus con ï¬rming the presence of the nucleolar location signal of NCL protein in this region. FRAP showssigniï¬cant changes in the kinetics and mobility of mutant NCL protein in the nucleoplasm. Conclusions: Several other studies have also reported de novo mutations in NCL in ASD or neurodevelopmental dis orders. Altered mislocalization and dynamics of mutant NCL (p. G664Glufs*70/ p.

Here we report patients from 14 unrelated consanguineous families with ARA. Materials and Methods: Patients were thoroughly examined by neurologists, radiologist, and evaluated and referred to gene testing by medical geneticists. Diagnostictargeted gene panels as well as whole exome sequencing (WES) coupled with autozygosity mapping were1424performed. Supplementary or con ï¬rmatory Sanger sequen cing was done together with family segregation analysis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were taken as part of radiological exam. Results: Among the affected individuals, eight patients were diagnosed with carrying two separate mutations (areported deletion and a novel compound heterozygous) in ATM . Affecteds from Family 2, 3, and 4 harbor a deletion in ATM assumingly a founder mutation with an estimated age of ~879 years. Among the cohort two families were found to carry SACS variants. One was already reported as a mutation and the other one is novel and likely to bepathogenic. Rest of the families were negative for any known ataxia related genes and variants. Conclusions: Our iterative ï¬ltering of WES revealed several novel candidate genes in these families. Our study is likely to discover previously unknown ARA genes.

We present the case of a 3 year old male with severe generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness together with neurodevelopmental delay. He presentsmicrocephaly and dysmorphic features highlighting micro retrognathy, low set ears and hypertelorism. Materials and Methods: Trio based exome analysis was carried out by using Nextera Truseq Rapid Enrichment kit and sequenced in NextSeq500 (Illumina). Results: The exome analysis revealed a novel mutation consisting on a small de novo 30 bp deletion in exon 9 of AUTS2 gene (Autism susceptibility candidate 2, OMIM:607270), which allowed the diagnosis of this patientas AUTS2 Syndrome or Mental Retardation, autosomal dominant 26 (OMIM:615834). AUTS2 gene is involved in the development of neurological disorders. Alterations ofAUTS2 gene were described as a result of genomic rear rangements, although large copy number variations and intragenic deletions or mutations have also been describedto cause this syndrome. It is noteworthy that the deletion found in this patient included the transcription start site of the short isoform of the gene, which plays an important rolein brain development. The gene expression analysis showed that the deletion causes reduction in the level of expression not only of the short isoform but also of the completetranscript of the gene. Conclusions: This case helps in establishing the genotype phenotype correlation adding more evidence tothe role of mutations speci ï¬cally affecting the short isoform for the development of a severe phenotype.

GWAS have shown that common risk factors substantially contribute to the development of BD andexplain 25 38% of the phenotypic variance. Rare variants with higher penetrance might explain some of the hidden heritability. A research strategy to identify such rarevariants is Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of promising multigenerational families with BD. In the present study we conducted WGS of 108 individuals in a set of 8 extendedmultigenerational and multiply affected families of Spanish origin. WGS was performed PCR free at 30X. VCFs were cre ated based on GATKÂ´s best practice guidelines. We set up a WGS analysis work ï¬ow based on vcfR. We conducted agene set/pathway analysis for the resulting genes using IPA and ConsensusPathDB. In addition to that we conducted Polygenic Risk Score analysis in the subset of the 8 families. In our analysis we focused on rare variants with a minor allele frequency below 1% (ExAC database). Our ï¬rst analysis is an âextended exome âanalysis of WGS data. We applied a narrow analysis model to identify overlapping, rare, co segregating variants in the affected individuals inone family which are not shared by healthy individuals within the same family. Additionally we applied an analysis model for incomplete penetrance. In total we identi ï¬ed 3 protein truncating and 9 missense variants. PRS analyses in the families show very diverse risk pro ï¬les for healthy and affected individuals. Gene set enrichment analyses mainlyhighlight immunological genes. S. B. Fischer: None. C. K.Y.

Mutations in four genes cause autosomal dominant PFBC (AD PFBC). Recently, bi allelic MYORG pathogenic var iants have been reported to cause autosomal recessive PFBC. Methods: We screened MYORG by whole exome sequencing in 29 unrelated probands negatively screened for the AD PFBC genes, studied the clinical and radi ological features in bi allelic pathogenic variant carriers andcompared them to that of 102 AD PFBC patients. Results: We identi ï¬ed 16 patients from 11 families with a bi allelic rare or novel predicted damaging variant. MYORG patients exhibited a high clinical penetrance (median age of onset of 52 years, range: 21 62) with motor impairment at the forefront. Dysarthria was the presenting sign in 11/16patients. In contrast to AD PFBC patients, 80% sympto matic patients eventually presented at least 4 of the fol lowing 5 symptoms: dysarthria, cerebellar syndrome, gait disorder, akinetic hypertonic syndrome and pyramidal signs. In addition, MYORG patients exhibited the most severe pattern of calci ï¬cations. Strikingly, 12/15 presented brainstem calci ï¬cations in addition to extensive calci ï¬ca tions in other brain areas (basal ganglia, cerebellum Â± cor tex). Among them, 8 patients exhibited pontinecalciï¬cations, which were never observed in AD PDFC. Finally, all patients exhibited cerebellar atrophy as con ï¬rmed by MRI Voxel Based Morphometry. Of note, in three families, the father carried small pallido dentate cal ciï¬cations, suggesting a putative phenotypic expression in some heterozygous carriers. Conclusions: We con ï¬rmMYORG as a novel major PFBC causative gene and identify a recognizable clinico radiological phenotype in the interface between PFBC and spino cerebellar ataxias. L.

Porto, Porto, Portugal Hereditary cerebellar ataxias are a group of neurodegenera tive disorders with a high clinical and genetic heterogeneity, characterized by incoordination of movement and speech, and unsteady gait. Several genes have been identi ï¬ed as causative of these diseases; however, several families remain without molecular diagnosis. In this study, we used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to study a cohort of Portuguese families with autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, identi ï¬ed during a systematic population based survey. These analysesrevealed two novel homozygous variants in KIF1C in two families with spastic ataxia: a frameshift variant (c.393_396del, p. Ser131Argfs*13) and a splice site variant(c.1166 2A>G), both segregating with the disease and conï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. Western blot analysisAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1427showed that the frameshift variant, located in the motor domain, leads to a truncated protein that lacks most of the KIF1C functional domains. We also demonstrated, using a minigene assay, that the splice variant abolishes the acceptor splice site, activating a new one 8 bp downstream. This change is predicted to cause a frameshift and a pre mature stop codon, thus leading to a truncated protein (p. Gly389Aspfs*27). KIF1C encodes a member of the kinesin 3 family, which are microtubule based motor proteins. Variants in KIF1C have been previously associated with SPG58 and SPAX2, both autosomal recessive diseases combining spasticity andcerebellar signs. Our study revealed two novel KIF1C variants in two families with a phenotype compatible with SPAX2. These variants probably cause KIF1C loss of function, supporting the role of intracellular traf ï¬cking in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia. M. Santos: None. S. Carmona: None. J. L. Neto: None.

These lesions include both limited porencephales and wider lesions such as hydranencephaly and schizence phaly, sometimes associated with intracranial calci ï¬cation. Nature of the lesions depends on timing and anatomical extension of the vascular insuf ï¬ciency. We report the case of a girl born in Kazakhstan after prenatal suspicion of microcephaly.

The ratio of isoforms F and S of CR1 (CD35), determined by the presence of some haplotypes or variants, has been related to late onset AD. Particularly the signi ï¬cant presence of the long isoform (S) is related to a lower total amount of CR1, which leads to a worse elimination of the Î² amyloid peptide (A Î²), greater activation of the microglia as an in ï¬ammatory response, and neuronal death. In this work we have generated a mixed cellular model of neuroin ï¬ammation, using as a model the cell lines SH SY5Y (neuron), 1321N1 (astrocyte) and HCM3 (micro glia). The results shown that these co cultures are able toactivate the glial cells when treated with lipopolysaccharide toxin (LPS) or A Î², increasing the protein markers for each activated cell type. This cellular model also increases theexpression of the genes of the complement complex pro teins ( CR1,C1q,C3and C4) in response to these treat ments. Preliminary results also suggest that the silencing ofCR1 in this model decreases neuronal viability with A Î², pointing to the role of this protein in neuronal survival in AD. This model could be a useful tool to test the effect of gene or pharmacological therapies to improve the response to A Î² and neuroin ï¬ammation, thus improving neuronal survival in AD.

He is the only child of parents of Nepalese descent. Materials and Methods: Conventional karyotyping was performed using standard GTG banding technique. FISHanalyses were performed on metaphase spreads according to the manufacturer âs speci ï¬cations. For microarray analysis, CytoSure Constitutional 180K microarray was used. Results: Chromosome analysis revealed four different cell lines: cell line I (28 %): normal karyotype; cell line II: bisatellited supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) (50%); cell line III: a different SMC (3 %); cell line IV: both SMC âs (19 %). The combined use of FISH probes and microarray analysis led to the following characterizations:the bisatellited marker chromosome as monocentric chro mosome 15 with no clue for euchromatin; the second marker chromosome as a complex ring chromosome 15with a 9,8 Mb duplication 15q11.2q13.3 including the Prader Willi /Angelman syndrome critical region, together with a 538 kb gain in band 15q11.2 (Burnside Butler syn drome region) presumably in triplicated form. Conclusion: We present a patient with a partial pentas omy 15q11.2/tetrasomy 15q11.2q13.3 mosaicism. Patientswith the recurrent chromosome 15q11 q13 duplication syndrome are characterized by intellectual disability, sei zures, and behavioural abnormalities, while patients with atriplication 15q11 q13 have a more severe neurosycholo gical phenotype.

However, only ~50% of THAP1 mutationcarriers develop dystonia. The underlying mechanisms of the reduced penetrance remain elusive. Maturing neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could serve as an in vitro model to unravel penetrance relevant mechanisms. Material and Methods: Human dermal ï¬broblasts were reprogrammed using non integrating Sendai virus and iPSCs were cultivated on Matrigel with E8 and mTeSR media. Neural differentiation of 32 iPSC lines into corticalneurons was achieved using dual SMAD inhibition, two neural rosette stages, and a dissociation step. Cortical neu rons were harvested on day 44 of differentiation for geneexpression analysis by quantitative PCR. Results: In the 44 day old neuronal lines, THAP1 expression was elevated in mutation carriers with p. Lys158Asnfs*23 and p. Ser21Cys mutations, but not in p. Arg13His carriers. A trend of increased THAP1 expression in affected compared to unaffected carriers was observed. Expression of TOR1A , another dystonia gene that possibly is regulated by the transcription factor THAP1, seemed unaltered. Furthermore, THAP1 expression was indepen dent of a seemingly penetrance linked polymorphism in the KAT6A promotor, a region that loops to the THAP1 pro motor as shown by 4C analysis. Conclusion: We observed higher expression of THAP1 in some mutation carriers compared to controls depending on the mutation, which may be explained by the autoregulationofTHAP1 . Further, the THAP1 expression level might correlate with the disease status. Future transcriptomic proï¬ling will shed light on dysregulated signaling pathways resulting in DYT THAP1 dystonia (FOR2488). H. Baumann: None. M. Trilck Winkler: None. M. Grosse: None. A.

L., Madrid, Spain, Madrid, Spain Introduction: Epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Frequently, these patientshave different type of seizure and may have other neurological symptoms. The goal of this study was to1430identify the genetic causes and to establish the diagnostic yield of trio analysis on patients with isolated seizures or with syndromic clinical presentations. Patients and Methods: A cohort of 81 probands was sequenced by Trio whole exome sequencing. The median age was 7 years old. In 78% of the probands, seizures weredescribed as part of a more complex phenotype. Genomic libraries were generated with Ion AmpliSeq TMor SureS electXTand sequenced by Ion ProtonTM/S 5TMXL or Nova Seq 6000. The data were processed using an âin house â developed pipeline. Results: A genetic diagnosis was obtained on 28 out of 81 patients, leading to a diagnostic yield of 35%. Among the identi ï¬ed variants the distribution was, 64% de novo, 18% homozygous, and 14% hemizygous, with a largeproportion of missense variants (64%). Diagnostic yield of 42%, was obtained in the syndromic cases (n ,63), identi fying variants not previously reported in targeted analysis. In the cases with isolated seizures (n ,22), the genetic diagnosis was only established in two cases, through the identi ï¬cation of de novo variants in the genes COL4A3BP and TBR1 , previously associated to a more complex phenotype. Conclusions: Exome trio sequencing is a cost effective strategy with a high diagnostic yield in syndromic patients with epilepsy that enables a phenotypic broad spectrum diagnosis.

We present cohort of 193 patients with epilepsy, both children and adults, divided in two groups 49 patients with isolated epilepsy and 144 patients with syndromic epilepsy (i.e. associated with developmental delay, dysmorphic features etc). ArrayCGH platform SurePrint G3 ISCA 4x180 and 8x60 (AgilentTechnologies) were used for the examinations. We detected CNVs in 32/193 of patients (16.6 %): 16 deletions (50 %), 12 duplications (38 %), one triplication (3 %) and more thanone CNV were detected in three patients (9 %). 15 CNVs were pathogenic and explaining the phenotype, three CNVs were probably pathogenic, two were benign and 12 werevariants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VOUS). Pathogenic and probably pathogenic CNVs were detected only in syndro mic patients. In patients with isolated epilepsy only VOUSand benign variants were detected. Origin of variants was determined as maternal (20 %), paternal (13 %), de novo (30 %) and was unknown in 37 % of cases. CNVs sizeranged from 15 kb to 9 Mb.

Our trio exome sequencing (ES) study (2016 2017) had a high diagnostic yield (15/30: 50%), demonstrated cost effectiveness and delineated novelgenetic causes of DEE; but could we improve the diagnostic yield further? Materials and Methods: Trio WGS (Illumina HiSeqX platform) was applied to 15 individuals undiagnosed by our ES study and 16 individuals undiagnosed by massively parallel sequencing panel. In house platforms Seave, Mity,ClinSV, Introme and ROHmer facilitated variant annotation andï¬ltration and identi ï¬cation of regions of homozygosity and mitochondrial, non coding and structural variants. Collaborations were initiated to clarify pathogenicity of novel variants. Results: 8 additional diagnoses were made in the 15 individuals from the ES study: 5 were detectable by ES but required collaborative clinical/functional studies to prove pathogenicity; 3 (20%) were genomic mechanisms unde tectable by ES (complex structural variants). 11 diagnoses were made in the 16 panel negative individuals (68%): the majority (n ,10) in genes excluded from the panel, 1 was missed for technical reasons. Conclusions: An ES or WGS approach plus periodic reanalysis and international collaborations can result in acumulative diagnostic yield of over 75% for DEE. WGS can robustly detect structural variants; ongoing research will assist non coding variant interpretation. Individualsundiagnosed after intensive genomic analysis often had normal development prior to seizure onset, and lacked congenital anomalies and neurological progression: theymay have alternative causes such as somatic mosaicism or polygenic variants.

Currently, studies have focused on investigating common or rare genetic variants but have yetto investigate ET transcriptomes. Methods: To identify relevant pathways and genes, the transcriptome of two cerebellar regions (dentate nucleus andcortex) derived from 16 cases and 16 age and sex matched controls was interrogated by RNA sequencing. A genome wide gene association study (GWGAS) was conductedusing 1,778 cases and 5,376 control individuals. Afterward, pathway enrichment was done using genes shown to be signiï¬cant after Bonferroni correction (P<2.7E 06) to nar row down transcriptomic pathways. Results: We identi ï¬ed several novel dysregulated genes including CACNA1A , a calcium voltage gated channel implicated in ataxia and reported to cause tremor in Cac na1a knockout mice. Furthermore, several pathways including axon guidance and calcium channel activity weresigniï¬cantly enriched. The GWGAS also revealed a sig niï¬cant enrichment across genes associated with calcium ion regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitter. Finally, thedentate nucleus and cerebellar cortex appeared to have different transcriptomes, supporting the notion of spatially different transcriptomes across the cerebellum. Conclusions: The identi ï¬cation of dysregulated path ways in post mortem cerebellum from patients can increa ses our understanding of the pathogenesis for thisunderstudied condition, which may reveal potential targets for therapeutic treatment. Calcium related pathways were shown to be relevant to ET and future studies shouldinvestigate the underlying mechanisms of this disruption.

The most common mutation worldwide is p. Val30Met. The present study aims to identify TTR genemutations in Greek patients and attempt genotype phenotype correlations. Materials and Methods: We studied 16 Greek indivi duals belonging to 10 families. These included 8 patients referred for suspected FAP, 6 asymptomatic relatives of patients, and 2 patients with an FAP clinical phenotype thatwere, however, originally referred for Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) gene testing and selected from a group of 800 sus pected CMT patients, negative for CMT1A. The moleculardiagnosis included screening for p. Val30Met with restric tion fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) and Sanger sequencing of the entire coding region of theTTR gene. Results: The p. Val30Met mutation was detected in 3 out of 10 index cases (30%). In the remaining probands, Sangersequencing identi ï¬ed the p. Cys10Arg, p. Arg34Gly, p. Arg54Thr, p. Ala81Thr, p. Glu89Gln, p. Glu89Lys and p. Val94Ala mutations. The p. Val30Met cases had the typicalearly onset neuropathic phenotype, without early cardio myopathy. The remaining patients had later onset neuro pathy and concomitant cardiac amyloidosis. In two of thesepatients the presenting symptom was exertional dyspnea. Conclusions: The p. Val30Met mutation is a frequent but not universal cause of FAP in the Greek population. Itseems to present with the early onset classic phenotype. Other mutations exhibit more varied phenotypes with later onset. Interestingly, some FAP patients are hidden withinthe large group of âsuspected CMT â. C. Kartanou: None. M. Breza: None. A.

It is featured by degeneration of thefrontal and temporal lobes of the brain and leads to behavioral and language impairments. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) play an important role in control ling protein expression. Variants in these elements have been linked with certain diseases. In this project, we will investigate the role of uORFs in granulin ( GRN ) associated FTD. Materials and Methods: Targeted resequencing of uORF harboring regions of GRN by design of an amplicon target ampli ï¬cation assay (Agilent, https://www.agilent. com) was performed. Screening was done in the Belgian cohort, consisting of 389 patients and 415 controlindividuals. Results: Investigation of ribosome pro ï¬ling databases and literature allowed us to identify four uORFs for GRN . Preliminary screening in the Belgian cohort revealed 2 variants present within a GRN uORF. First variant (2/415 controls, 1/389 patients) is within a splice region and itspresence could promote differential splicing by the spli ceosome machinery. The second variant (3/415 controls, 2/ 389 patients) leads to a change in the amino acid sequenceof the uORF close to the termination codon, which could inï¬uence ribosomal occupancy, thus affecting translations of the downstream protein. Conclusions: These variants could act as potential modiï¬ers, affecting GRN serum levels or age at onset. Therefore, functional validation of these variants could leadto the development of biomarkers and provide novel mechanistic insights in FTD. A. Frydas: None. E. Wauters: None. B. Heeman: None. J.

In some cases this might be due to undetected pathogenic copy number variants. We evaluated a high density SNP array to assess dosage abnormalities in ataxiaand spastic paraplegia. Methods: 10 patients were genotyped with CytoScan_ XON_array (ThermoFisher). The following deletions hadbeen previously detected by MLPA: SPAST exon 1 (1.52kb, N,2), exons 6 7 (0.58kb, N ,2) and exons 2 17 (154.4kb, N,1);SPG11 exon 29 (0.21kb, N ,1);ABCD1 exons 3 10 (10.11kb, N ,4). We included 94 control samples from the 1000G_IBS collection. Patients with deletion of SPAST exon 1 and SPG11 exon 29 were genotypes in duplicate and triplicate, respectively, to evaluate inter experiment repro ducibility. Data analysis was carried out with CHAS Â® software. Results: All assays passed quality check and were con sistent between replications. Concordant results from MLPA and array were obtained in 5/10 cases: ABCD1 exons 3 10, SPAST exons 1, 6 7, and 2 17, the latter including contiguous genes ( SLC30A6 ,NLRC4 ). In 3 patients ABCD1 deletion was partially detected, exons 3 5 (3.51kb). The deletion was not detected by the array in 2/10 cases: SPAST exons 6 7, SPG11 exon 29, albeit observable upon visual examination in all 13 assays. There were nogains or losses in control samples. Conclusions: CytoScan_XON array is useful to identify gene deletions in parallel, even at exon level. False negativerate was 20% (2/10), however these deletions were visually observable.

GRID2 is involved in ataxia through both loss of function mutations and gain of function mutations due to respective deletions and missense variations. Here, we report the identi ï¬cation and characterisation of a novel ARCA caused by bi allelic duplication of GRID2 in two siblings. Methods: Illuminia Â®Truesight One clinical exome was performed on one of the siblings with MiSeq next âgenera tion sequencing platform. Whereas chromosomal micro array analysis was performed on the entire family by usingAfï¬metrix Optima Â®chips. Variants were evaluated based on the phenotype and standard in silico tools. Results: No disease causing mutations were reported as a result of the clinical exome test. Chromosomal microarray analysis showed a ~121 kb homozygous duplication of GRID2 (chr4:94,447,511 94,569,021), including exon 14,in two siblings. Conclusion: Previously there has been reports of homo zygous deletions and missense mutations of GRID2, but ourstudy is the ï¬rst one to identify a homozygous duplication of the gene. This mutation, which segregated in two siblings with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia, will help usunderstand the effect of the exon 14 of GRID2 on the phenotype and the structure of the GluRD2 protein. These ï¬ndings provide us with the conclusion that chromosomal microarray should be the ï¬rst step of the diagnostic process of autosomal recessive ataxia types. A. Ceylan: None. E.

Nadif Kasri1,2,3 1Department of Human Genetics, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Netherlands,2Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour, Nijmegen, Netherlands,3Department of Cognitive Neurosciences, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Netherlands The brain is a complex neural network that requires a precisely tuned interplay of excitatory and inhibitory signals in order to function. Disruptions in synaptic connectivity, inparticular the balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I), have been shown to underlie neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, the mechanisms underlyingthis coordination remain elusive. One gene that is implicated NDDs is Cadherin 13 (CDH13 ). Dysregulations ofCDH13 have been linked to attention de ï¬cit/hyperactiv ity disorder and comorbid disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Studies in mice showed that Cdh13 localises at the inhibitory presynapse, and when knocked out leads toincreased inhibitory drive onto hippocampal CA1 pyrami dal neurons. However, the mechanism by which CDH13 regulates the function of inhibitory synapses in humanneurons remains unknown. To understand the function of CDH13 in human neurons, we generated both GABAergic and Glutamatergic neurons via controlled differentiation ofInduced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hIPSC). Using RNA interference we reduced CDH13 expression in GABAergic neurons. We investigated neuronal network communicationby means of Micro Electrode Arrays, whereas on a single cell level, inhibitory synaptic transmission was assessed using whole cell patch clamp recordings. Our data showsthat CDH13 knockdown in human GABAergic neurons increases inhibitory control on glutamatergic neurons recorded by MEA. Moreover, cell adhesion assay revealedthat ITG Î²1 and ITG Î²3 play an opposite role in the regulation of inhibitory synaptic strength via interaction with CDH13. In summary, these results point towards animportant role for CDH13 in inhibitory synapses via CDH13 ITG Î²1/ITG Î²3 interaction, which could be critical in the maintenance of the E/I balance. B.

Here we present a novel de novo heterozygous mutation in the HECW2 gene in a patient with growth retardation and epileptic encephalopathy. Material Methods: A seven year old boy who referred to our clinic with epilepticencephalopathy had severely delayed psychomotor devel opment, absent speech and feeding dif ï¬culty. His height, weight and head circumference measurements were lessthan 3 rdcentile. His motor tonic seizures were reported to start at the age of two and to continue daily. Generalized epileptic changes were present in his EEG. Progressiveatrophy of cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem was seen in the cranial MRI. WES analysis was performed in order to elucidate the aetiology of the neurodevelopmental disorder. Results: A novel de novo heterozygous mutation c.4484G>A (p. Arg1495Lys) was found in the HECW2 gene. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, only four mutations in the HECW2 have been identi ï¬ed in ten patients. Because of the rareness of the reported cases, herewe present the patient with a novel HECW2 variant asso ciating with his clinical ï¬ndings. Similar reports are still needed to clarify genotype phenotype correlations ofNDHSAL. M. H. Demirbas: None. P. Ãzbudak: None. A. Ser daroÄlu:None. M. A. ErgÃ¼n: None. E. F. PerÃ§in: None.",2019

Autosomalrecessive or dominant mutations of Erlin2 have been implicated in complex motor neuron diseases with cognitive impairment, including hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG18. Materials and Methods: We analysed the exome sequencing of four patients of a large family with autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia signi ï¬cantly linked to the SPG37 locus, a chromosomal region containing the Erlin2 gene and overlapping the SPG18 locus. Fibroblasts of an affected patient and of a sex and age matched control weresubjected to an agonist of IP3 receptors to analyse their degradation by the proteasome. Fibroblasts were also transfected with siRNAs targeting the pathological allele toobserve the reversal of the phenotype. Results: We identi ï¬ed the heterozygous c.194C>T (p. T65I) missense variant in Erlin2 segregating in the family. Mutated and wild type alleles were expressed at the same level in ï¬broblasts. Compared to controls, IP3 receptors degradation was slower in mutated ï¬broblasts, suggesting a degradation process blockage. To test the hypothesis that the variant acts as a dominant negative, we speci ï¬cally downregulated the p. T65I variant using siRNA. WhileErlin2 levels remained normal in control lines, a 50% downregulation of the p. T65I allele was observed in the SPG37 line with reduced degradation capacities of IP3receptors. Conclusion: We report that a heterozygous missense variant of Erlin2 accounts for SPG37 through a dominant negative effect on the IP3 receptors degradation in vitro . G. Stevanin: None. A.

Sudan is located in east Africa which is a region known for the high genetic diversity among itspopulation. The Sudanese population is characterized by high rates of consanguineous marriages (40 49%). Methodology: We used next generation sequencing tar geted genes panel screening and whole exome sequencing to study 25 Sudanese families with SCD. We analyzed the sequencing data using online and in house bioinformatictools. We con ï¬rmed the segregation of the identi ï¬ed can didate variants with the disease phenotype in the studied families using Sanger sequencing. Results: We identi ï¬ed 24 culprit variants, 18 of these were in 15 genes previously linked to SCD and six were located in six new candidate genes never linked to patho logical phenotypes in man. Out of the 18 variants in the known SCD genes, 11 variants were novel, one was auto somal dominant, six were compound heterozygous and 11were homozygous. Three of the variants were possible founder variants: NM_024306.4( FA2H ):c.674T>C and NM_021222.2( PRUNE1 ):c.132+2T>C, each in two famil ies; NM_138422.3( ADAT3 ):c.430G>A in one of our families and was previously identi ï¬ed in families from the gulf area. Conclusion: We studied 25 Sudanese families with her editary spinocerebellar degeneration, and we identi ï¬ed the causative mutations in 88% of these families. The 24 culpritvariants were found in 15 genes previously linked to the phenotype and in six new candidate genes under validation through functional studies. A. Yahia Osman Mohamed: None. M.

Tammimies1 1Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (KIND), Karolinska Institute, Solna, Sweden,2Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institute, Solna, Sweden,3Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden Background: Mutations affecting HNRNPU (Heteroge neous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U) located on chr1q44 have been described in individuals with various neurode velopmental disorders. HNRNPU is one of the componentsof the spliceosome and shown to regulate the 3D genome organization. However, the role of HNRNPU in neuronal development has not been characterized. Material and Methods: Induced pluripotent stem cells from controls and individuals with HNRPU mutations will be used to investigate its role in neuronal development. HNRNPU expression is measured during the early stages of the neuronal differentiation using the neuroepithelial stem cell like (NES) model followed with detailed investigationsof the 3D genome organization, transcriptomics including splicing patterns and DNA/RNA targets of HNRNPU using high throughput methods. Results: We have identi ï¬ed a monozygotic twin pair with severe ID, autism and epilepsy carrying a ~44.3Kb het erozygous deletion of HNRNPU and COX20. The expres sion of HNRNPU in NES cells was con ï¬rmed to be reduced ~50% due to the deletion as expected. In control cell lines, theHNRNPU expression was reduced upon neuronal dif ferentiation, however similar pattern was not seen in the deletion carrier. We are currently investigating the early time points of neuronal differentiation and how the multipleroles of HNRNPU are connected to the typical and atypical trajectories of the neuronal development using multiple omics methods. Conclusions: Reduction of HNRNPU levels interfere with differentiation at an early phase of neuronalcommitment. Our study will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that could underlie the NDDs associated with HNRNPU mutations and 1q44 deletions. F. Mastropasqua: None. I. Rabkina: None. M. Becker: None. B.

Functional in vitro analysis has been performed for a very limited number of these variants,suggesting a probable dominant negative effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the implication of HTRA1 heterozygous mutations in cSVD in a large consecutiveseries of patients. Samples from 2135 unrelated adult patients were referred consecutively from 2016 to 2018 in the neurovascular genetics department of LariboisiÃ¨rehospital for targeted sequencing of known cSVD genes, including HTRA1 . Heterozygous HTRA1 missense variants with a prevalence < 1/10 000 in polymorphism databasesand predicted to be pathogenic by at least 2 in silico prediction softwares were retained. Among these 2135 patients, 35 patients (1.6%) showed a heterozygouscandidate missense variation. Only 7 of the detected variations were previously described (and 5 functionally tested). 16 of them predicted as being pathogenic have notyet been reported. Frequencies of candidate missense in our series and control samples from GnomAD are signi ï¬cantly different (p ,6.4E 7, OR: 1.8 3.7), con ï¬rming the involve ment of HTRA1 in cSVD pathogenesis. Co segregation of these variants in affected relatives is ongoing. However, additional functional screening of these variants, includingresidual htra1 enzyme activity measurement and trimeriza tion analysis are now required to establish or in ï¬rm their pathogenicity, raising a strong challenge in a diagnosiscontext.

30540,"Semmelweis Universitiy, Budapest, Hungary, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: Huntington and Huntington like diseases are progressive neurodegenerative disorders which are char acterized by uncontrolled movements (chorea), emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. The classical Huntington chorea is associated with the abnormaltrinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. In the remaining cases, mutations of the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide (G 4C2),TBP (TATA box binding protein) trinucleotide (CAG/CAA) repeat and prion protein ( PRNP ) genes mutations may also cause a Huntington like clinical phenotype. Aims: In this study the genetic background of chorea like movement distur bances were investigated among our Hungarian cohort. Patients and Methods: In 375 (mean age 45.2 years) patients with choreiform movement disorder, the HTT, C9ORF72, TBP repeats and PRNP mutations were analysed. Results: The expanded HTT allele (>40 CAG repeat) repeat expansion were found in 335 cases. The mean of the expanded repeat numbers is 44.6. Abnormal C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeats were detected in 3 cases (one patient has full mutation (>30 G 4C2repeat) and two others have intermedier range (24 29 G 4C2repeat) hexanucleotide repeat expansions). The TBP repeat disease was determined in one patient, and in further one case a PRNP octa nuclteotide in frame deletion was detected. Discussion: The rate of occurrence of HTT gene abnor mal trinucleotide expansion in our investigated cohorts is 90%. The remaining 10% of patients are classi ï¬ed as Huntington like clinical phenotypes. In this group, the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide gene was detected in 7.5%, while in the TBP and PRNP mutations were present in 2.5 2.5%.This study was supported by KTIA_13_NAP A III/6 to V. A V. grant. A.

We evaluated a novel tripled repeat primed PCR basedtechnology for estimation of HTT CAG repeats in 46 HD reference DNA samples, including 34 samples carrying alleles with full penetrance (> 40 CAGs). Of the sampleswith full penetrance alleles, 20 harbored alleles larger than 60 CAG repeats, generally seen in subjects with juvenile onset HD < 20 years and in the rarest pediatric variant. Analyzed samples had been previously tested using either ï¬urescent repeat ï¬anking PCR or tripled repeat primed PCR method, or both. All samples showed full concordance withthe previously veri ï¬ed allele sizes. Identical repeat size or sizing errors within Â±1 CAG were obtained for alleles â¤42 CAG repeats, whereas sizing errors within Â±3 were obtainedfor alleles > 43 CAG repeats, conforming to established guidelines. The assay was able to accurately size 18 samples with very large alleles comprised between 60 and 100 CAGrepeats, and to detect two exceptionally large alleles with more than 200 CAG repeats. This method provides a rapid, sensitive and reliable method to accurately genotype theHTT CAG repeat stretch, and extends the detection limit of large expanded alleles to over 200 CAG repeats, thus providing a comprehensive molecular diagnostic evaluationof all HD samples, including those pediatric forms carrying extremely large, hard to detect, alleles.

HD may have a severe impact on family dynamics, and growing up with a parent with HD may be challenging. Adult individuals at risk can get predictive genetic testing. Materials and Methods: We used an explorative quali tative study design and interviewed 36 persons who cur rently grow up or grew up with a parent with HD, and analyzed the interviews using thematic analysis. Results: Participants described several challenges related to the decision regarding predictive testing. Some wanted to enjoy life without knowing. Others lacked motivation for getting an education and limited their involvement inromantic relationships, even though they did not know whether they had the mutation or not. Participants described ineffective coping mechanisms and a search for symptomsbefore predictive testing, continuing after they had tested positive for the mutation. Others, positive for the mutation, described a relief of ï¬nally having the knowledge, and an increased understanding of affected family members. Par ticipants who had tested negative for the mutation were surprised by ambivalent feelings, and described a need forfollow up after they had received a negative test result. Conclusion: Predictive testing for HD is a demanding process. Individuals who grow up in families affected byHD, worry about the potential genetic risk for themselves and their siblings. The current study indicates that indivi duals may need long term follow up from the healthcaresystem whether they test positive or negative for the mutation. C. von der Lippe: None. K. H.

However, in practise, most patients present during infancy with slowly developing symptoms, or even later in life withsubtle or neglected symptoms. Despite being a relativelycommon congenital disorder (1.1/1000), the genetic aetiol ogy of hydrocephalus remains unclear. Objectives: 1. Candidate gene analysis of 113 genes in 6,077 whole exome sequenced individuals (50 with hydrocephalus) 2. Explore the cellular pathways involving the implicated genes to understand better, how dysfunction of these genes might lead to or in ï¬uence the expression of hydrocephalus. Materials and Methods: This register based cohort study is a sub study of the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH) and com bines data from The National Patient Registry, and TheDanish Neonatal Screening Biobank. Genetic variants identi ï¬ed in the candidate genes were ï¬ltered based on minor allele frequency (MAF) data. We removed variantswith MAF >2 x 10 5in gnomAD or >5 x 10 3in controls. Results: Forty nine mutations were identi ï¬ed in 31 genes. Interestingly, along with the known hydrocephalus causing genes ( CCDC88C, MPDZ ) several of the genes implicated are involved cilia formation and function (CEP290, USP9X, SNX10, TMEM67 ) as well as cortico genesis and neuronal adhesion and migration ( CELSR2, FLNA ). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that a high proportion of Danish hydrocephalus patients have an underlying genetic predisposition and the genes involved affect pathways of importance for Cilia, corticogenesis aswell as neuronal adhesion and migration.

Our goal is to evaluate if the diagnostic yield estimated by targeted sequencing in our cohorts of ID or ASDs subjects is higher than that obtained by CGH array. We screened 701 in house selected ID related genes and 189 autism related genes in a cohort of more than 100 and 60 patients, respectively. Libraries were prepared withdifferent capture kits and the Illumina NextSeq500 platform was used to sequence targeted regions. Bioinformatic analysis was performed with an in house pipeline.

CHSis characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, predisposition to bleeding, immunode ï¬ciency and progressive neurologi cal dysfunction. Bone marrow transplantation has been asymptomatic treatment for the immune defects but does not alter the course of the relentless neurodegeneration. To date, several animal models of CHS have been identi ï¬ed, but none of them consistently recapitulate the neurological phenotype seen in patients. Additionally, the role of LYST in lysosome biology is still is poorly understood and couldbe cell dependent. For these reasons, we aim to investigate the function of LYST in a neuronal cell model and to identify targets for therapy. We used clustered regularlyinterspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR interference technologies to knock out or knock down the expression of endogenous LYST in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which were genetically engineered to facilitate an inducible expression of Neuro genin 2. With this approach, we have established aglutamatergic neuronal CHS model de ï¬cient for LYST expression, to analyze the localization, size and function of lysosomes in neurons. Using this technique, we were able togenerate a homogenous population of neuronal cells, which are essential for global proteome, transcriptome and metabolome studies not only of CHS, but also for otherMendelian loss of function neurogenetic diseases.1440J.

PME type 3 is an autosomal recessive disease and is associated with pathogenic variants in the gene KCTD7 thatencode potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein 7. Disruption of the function of this gene can lead to a change in the potassium ion current in theneurons of the brain. We investigate 9 patients with an average age of debut of the ï¬rst attacks between 1 and 2 years of life and try to establish gene phenotype correlation. Theï¬rst symptoms started after an episode of febrile fever: sudden falls without loss of consciousness, and with episodes of fading. All patients had the drug resistantgeneralized myoclonic seizures. MRI of the brain, long term video EEG monitoring, examination by various clinical specialists were performed for each patient. NGSsequencing revealed seven previously undescribed non synonymous variants and one previously undescribed dinucleotide frame shift deletion in the last exon.

The pathogenesis of LOAD is result from interactions among multiple environmental and genetic factors which consist of considerable hereditary compo nents. Recent large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) in Caucasian have revealed more than 30 genetic loci for LOAD susceptibility. In contrast, GWAS for Asiangroups including Japanese are relatively modest, and have poor reproducibility of associations for identi ï¬ed loci in Caucasian due to possible difference of genetic architectureamong ethnicity in addition to lack of study power. In this context, we launched GWAS using an ethnicity speci ï¬c SNP array, Japonica. To date, we obtained the genotypedata for approximately 7,000 Japanese individuals (includ ing 2,400 LOAD, 1,400 other dementia and 3,200 controls) and imputed the data with a Japanese reference panel(ToMMo 3.5KJ) constructed using whole genome sequences from 3,500 Japanese. We tentatively conducted a GWAS using the imputed genotype data (~10,000,000SNPs) for approximately 2,400 LOAD cases and 3,200 controls. We combined this GWAS result and the data of another Japanese GWAS reported elsewhere for meta analysis (a total of 8,000 individuals), and found GWAS signiï¬cance for the APOE and SORL1 loci and a novel locus with LOAD.

The disease is fully penetrant in individuals with 40 or more CAG repeats, and has reduced penetrance in the range of36 39 repeats. Overall the age at onset, usually at midlife, inversely correlates with the number of CAG repeats, and severity of symptoms vary widely between individuals.

Methods: LTL (T/S ratio) was measured in manifest HD patients (HD, n ,62) and pre manifest HD patients (pre HD, n,38) with fully penetrant alleles, in subjects with reduced penetrant alleles (rp HD, n ,23), and age matched controls (n,76). Results: Mean LTL values of controls, pre HD and HD patients were signi ï¬cantly different (p< 0.0001), in the order: HD (0.58 Â± 0.07) <pre HD (0.78 Â± 0.16) <controls (0.92 Â± 0.09). Mean LTL values of rp HD subjects (0.82Â± 0.16) were signi ï¬cantly lower than controls (p ,0.003), but similar to pre HD patients. An inverse relationship between mean LTL and CAG repeat number was found in the pre HD (p,0.03). Conclusion: In pre HD patients, LTL shorten gradually according to advancing age and CAG number, up to the low values observed in HD patients. A similar LTL shorteningseems to be present in rp HD, but at more advanced age. The possible use of LTL as biomarker of disease progres sion is discussed.

There are currently 30 recognized forms of leukodystro phies with distinct clinical, biochemical and radiological characteristics. However, the genetics of these classicalforms of leukodystrophies remain unknown in many parts of the world especially in Sub Saharan Africa. Methods: In this study, we selected 5 consanguineous leukodystrophic families from Sudan using clinical and MRI recognition pattern. Genomic DNA was extracted and screened for mutations using NGS panel testing 153 leu kodystrophies and leucoencephalopathies causing genes (NextSeq500 Illumina). Results: Three novel homozygous variants were dis covered: one (c.380G>C, p. Arg127Pro) in PSAP gene causing MLD, and two (c.831_838DUPATATCTGT, p. Ser280Tyrfs*8 and c.971T>G, p. Ile324Ser) in MLC1 gene in the two families with MLC. The segregation pattern was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The pathogenicity of these variants was predicted usingbioinformatics tools. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst study to underlie the genetics of leukodystrophies in Sudan. Analysis of additionalfamilies are in progress in order to establish the whole spectrum of genetic variations causing inherited leukody strophies in Sudanese families. M. Amin: None. I. Dorboz: None.

We report a consanguineous familywith two affected children. Both children presented a neurodegenerative disorder with a motor degradation and1442nystagmus after 15 months, spastic quadriplegia after 3y and epilepsia after 7y leading to death at respectively 8 and 10y of age. MRI demonstrated a progressive atrophy of the spinal cord, the optic nerve, the corpus callosum and the cortex associated with a demyelinating aspect of the sustentorial periventricular WM. Axonal peripheral neuro pathy was observed in both patients. Biochemichal analysis were negative Homozygosity mapping combined to whole exome sequencing revealed two homozygous mutations in two ARSs. One mutation in EPRS (c.3344C>T/p. Pro1115Leu) a bifunctional aminoacyl tRNA synthetase that catalyzes theaminoacylation of both glutamic acid and proline tRNA species, recently involved in a hypomyelinating Leukody strophy and a second mutation in IARS2 encodes a mito chondrial isoleucyl tRNA synthetase reported to cause CAGSSS that is characterised by cataracts, growth hormone deï¬ciency, sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and skeletal dysplasia. Co segregation analysis con ï¬rmed that the two mutations were inherited from heterozygous carrier parents. In silico analysis predicted these variation tobe deleterious. The phenotype of our patients were more severe than the reported patient with the same mutation in ERPS gene. Our patients had no cataract or dysplasia or growth hormone de ï¬ciency reported in IARS2 patient. The phenotype may be the result of the mutation of the two genes.

More recently, variants in KIF1A have also been described in a few cases with autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. Methods: Clinical exome sequencing data of 315 unre lated patients with mostly âpureâspastic paraplegia were analysed for KIF1A variants. Clinical characteristics of patients with KIF1A variants were analysed, segregation analyses were performed, and types of variants were compared. Results: In 21 patients we identi ï¬ed 19 different KIF1A variants. Patients and affected family members showed a slowly progressive, mostly pure form of spastic paraplegia,but with a highly variable disease onset (0 57 years). Seg regation analyses showed a de novo occurrence in ï¬ve cases, and a dominant inheritance pattern in eight families. The motor domain of KIF1A seems to be the hotspot for pathogenic variants in autosomal dominant spastic para plegia, similar to mental retardation type 9 and recessivespastic paraplegia type 30. Unlike these allelic disorders, however, dominant spastic paraplegia was also caused by loss of function variants outside this domain in six families. Three missense variants were identi ï¬ed outside the motor domain and need further characterization. Conclusions: KIF1A variants are a frequent cause of autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia in our cohort (5 7%), with a high de novo rate. The identi ï¬cation of KIF1A loss of function variants suggests haploinsuf ï¬ciency as a possible mechanism in autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia. E. Kamsteeg: None. M. Pennings: None. M.

Indeed, previous research suggests that only the atypical MDD subtype, characterizedbyï¬ve symptoms (increased appetite, hypersomnia, mood reactivity, leaden paralysis and interpersonal rejection sensitivity), is associated with obesity. We investigatedwhether the association between atypical MDD and genetic variants related to obesity is accounted for by the appetite criterion alone or whether the other atypical criteria alsocontribute to this association. Materials and Methods: Two studies, CoLaus| PsyCo Laus (Switzerland) and NESDA| NTR (Netherlands), thatassessed MDD subtypes and symptoms, were meta analysed to evaluate the associations between atypical MDD symptoms (386 and 179 participants, respectively)with the rs9939609 FTO polymorphism and the polygenic risk score (PRS) from 76 loci signi ï¬cantly associated with Body Mass Index according to a recent GWAS meta analysis. Results: Our meta analysis shows positive associations between the symptom increased appetite and both the FTOvariant and the PRS (odds ratio (OR) ,1.37; 95% con ï¬dence interval (CI) ,1.17 1.62, P,1.33x10 04and OR,1.15, 95%CI ,1.03 1.29, P,0.014, respectively), a negative association between the FTO and the symptom leaden paralysis (OR ,0.82, 95%CI ,0.72 0.93, P,0.003) and a negative association between the PRS and thesymptom rejection sensitivity (OR ,0.92, 95%CI ,0.85 0.99, P,0.036). Conclusions: The association between increased appetite and obesity related genetic variants drives the association between these variants and the atypical subtype, suggesting that other genes could be involved in the regulation of theother atypical symptoms, re ï¬ecting the genetic hetero geneity of MDD.

Kaname1 1National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan,2Osaka Women âs and Children âs Hospital, Osaka, Japan Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) is a responsible gene for Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM#312750) that is inherited in an X linked dominant manner. Pathogenicvariant of MECP2 are found in approximately 80% of patients with RTT. Partial and whole gene deletions are accounting for 7.3% in all variants observed. We encoun tered a patient of RTT with large deletion of MECP2 . A patient is 7 year old girl born to non consanguineous parents at 40 weeks with birth weight of 2,484, height of 47cm and head circumstance of 31.5 cm. Amniotic ï¬uid karyotyping showed 46,XX. She was clinically suspected RTT based on neurodevelopmental disorder characterizedby psychomotor regression with the development of dis tinctive hand stereotypies. However, no pathogenic variant was detected in the MECP2 gene by direct sequencing and MLPA. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Map ping images of WES suggested a heterozygous large dele tion between the exon 4 of MECP2 and upstream region of IRAK in the patient. The deletion was veri ï¬ed by long range PCR and following sequencing. Transcripts of MECP2 were con ï¬rmed by 3 âRACE analysis. The deletion was occurred in father âs allele. A novel transcript derived from the deleted allele consisted of exon 3 and alternativelyspliced regions of exon 4 under GT AT rule. Coding length was expected 582 bp (194 amino acid). The translated product lacked two AT hook domains, which are essentialfor DNA binding. Brain speci ï¬c polyadenylation signal was found 17 bp upstream of poly A site.

Duplication could be de novo or inherited from an asymptomatic carrier mother. We have molecularly characterized 22 Spanish children with MECP2 duplication syndrome and their carrier mothers. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterization was done using a checklist designed for the project. Duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array and con ï¬rmed by Real Time qPCR. Localization of the duplication wasstudied by FISH. MECP2 expression was checked by RT qPCR in blood cells and skin ï¬broblast cells when avail able. We performed XCI assay to affected females andcarrier mothers. Results: We have noticed that in the minimum duplicated region (MDR) of all our patients there are MECP2 and IRAK1 genes and both are overexpressed. The cohort was classi ï¬ed according to different chromosomal localizations of the MDR: tandem in ChrXq28, ChrXp and ChrY. The clinical severity seems to be related to the position of theduplication, where the insertion in ChrY leads to the most severe phenotype. Conclusions: Due to the fact that IRAK1 is present in all the duplications we hypothesize that it must be implicated in the disorder. We encourage the study of the pathways in which IRAK1 participates. Besides, the point of insertion of the duplication seems to be crucial for the severity of the patient, as well as the genes involved in each rearrange ment.

The exact de ï¬nition may be slightly different for different countries, in the Czech Republic the microcephaly is deï¬ned as the head circumference under the 3rdpercentile for speci ï¬c age and sex of the particular individual. Methods: We present a retrospective epidemiological study of the incidence of microcephaly (ICD 10 code Q02) in the livebirths and in the prenatally diagnosed cases in the Czech Republic (time period 1994 2015). The data wereobtained from the National Registry of Congenital Anomalies. During the selected time period the registry included only the cases of congenital anomalies in childrenunder 15 years of age. Surveillance program is population based. Results: There were 2 140 009 livebirths in the Czech Republic during 1994 2015 time period. The average inci dence of microcephaly was 1.07 per 10 000 of livebirths (highest was 1.72 in 2002 and lowest was 0.33 in 1998).The anomaly was more common amongst girls F/M ratio was 1.32/1.0. Only few cases of microcephaly were diag nosed prenatally (average incidence in prenatal diagnostics0.12 per 10 000). Discussion: The overall incidence of microcephaly in the Czech Republic is low compared to the data from otherpopulation based registries. We believe, that the clinicians tend to report only severe cases of congenital microcephaly with neurological symptoms.

The molecular diagnosis remains unknown in about 40% cases. Materials and Methods: Patients with microcephaly with unknown etiology based on preliminary evaluation were enrolled. CMA was done using Affymetrix 750K. Where no pathogenic CNVs were identi ï¬ed, WES was done. Results: Out of total 51 patients, CMA was done in 34 patients. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic CNVs were identi ï¬ed in 6 cases while candidate genes in ROH was identi ï¬ed in 4 cases. WES was done in 32 patients (12 con sanguineous). Pathogenic/likely pathogenic SNVs wereidenti ï¬ed in 14 patients. Biallelic variations were identi ï¬ed inCIT, ANKLE2, ORC1, RNASEH2A, ASPM, PEX7, CENPF, PCNT, AIMP2 and RNU4ATAC . Siblings with likely pathogenic variation in CENPF had severe short stature ( 3.5SD) and microcephaly ( 8SD) without oph thalmological abnormalities as reported in cases ofStromme syndrome suggesting that CENPF mutation can result in phenotypes of isolated microcephaly. Previously reported heterozygous pathogenic variations were identi ï¬ed in 3 patients (heterozygous in MECP2 and TUBA1A and hemizygous deletion in PQBP1 ). One patient showed double heterozygous likely pathogenic variations inMCPH1 and ASPM inherited from asymptomatic parents indicating the possibility of digenic inheritance. Conclusions: Genomic techniques gave diagnostic yield of 39% [20 out of 51]. The study identi ï¬ed 8 novel likely pathogenic SNVs and 4 likely pathogenic CNVs and expanded the phenotypic spectrum of CENPF .

We1446aimed to perform detailed phenotypic and genomic analysis of patients with Mendelian forms of CM. Methods: Clinical phenotyping, targeted or exome sequencing, and autozygome analysis. Results: We describe 150 patients (104 families) with 56 Mendelian forms of CM. Our data show little overlap withthe genetic causes of postnatal microcephaly. We also show that a broad de ï¬nition of primary microcephaly âas an autosomal recessive form of nonsyndromic CM with severepostnatal deceleration of occipitofrontal circumference âis highly sensitive but has a limited speci ï¬city. In addition, we expand the overlap between primary microcephaly andmicrocephalic primordial dwar ï¬sm both clinically (short stature in >52% of patients with primary microcephaly) and molecularly (e.g., we report the ï¬rst instance of CEP135 related microcephalic primordial dwar ï¬sm).

Although the etiology is often unknown,this spectrum of conditions has a strong genetic component. The aim of this study was to design a customized targetedgene panel to investigate the genetic bases of CP and MD with childhood onset. The panel includes 59 genes considered disease causing or related with primitive MD/ CP conditions. In 9 of 18 subjects tested so far, we selected 14 new or low frequency single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 10 of the 59 selected genes. Five variants in genesassociated with pediatric onset MD ( ANO3 ,AP4S1 ,AP4E1 and VPS13D ), two (one missense and one intronic) in GAD1 a gene considered to be associated to CP, and seven missense variants in candidate CP genes ( ITPR1, NAA35, MCPH1, PACRG, SCN8A, SPTBN2 andTENM1 ).A homo zygous truncating mutation, already described in literature,was found in AP4S1 . A few potentially disease related variants were detected in genes associated with recessive phenotypes: an apparently homozygous missense variant inMCPH1 suspected to mask a heterozygous gene deletion is currently under characterization. A VPS13D and a GAD1 likely pathogenic variants were detected as compoundheterozygous in association respectively with a samesense and an intronic VUS both predicted as possibly altering splicing mechanisms.

The SYNaPS Study, which is IRB/ethics approved and aimed at analysingunexplained ultra rare neurological conditions, aim to identify underlying genetic causes in patients with pediatric movement disorders by high throughput geneticinvestigations. Materials and Methods: As part of SYNaPS study a large cohort of well phenotyped families recruited frommultiple paediatric neurology clinics around the world with a diverse ethnic background affected by different childhoodAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1447and early onset movement disorders were genetically and clinically investigated. exome sequencing was performed for probands of around 500 families with any forms of movement disorders. Some of the unsolved individuals were subjected to a combination of SNP Array genotyping/ homozygosity mapping, whole genome sequencing andlong read sequencing. Results: Overall, in this study we resolved around 50% of the patients with movement disorders. We also uncoverednovel disease causing genes in various families. Re anno tating/re analysing the exome data along with more exten sive data sharing and also employing homozygositymapping in some of the families increased the rate of diagnosis.

FCMD is mainly caused by an ancestral insertionof 3 kb retrotransposal element into the 3 âuntranslated region of the causative gene, fukutin . Recently, we testi ï¬ed that pathogenic exon trapping by the transposon causesplicing abnormality in FCMD. We have testi ï¬ed that antisense oligonucleotides targeting this splicing could be a possible therapy in the future. However, there has been nobiomarkers or few report on natural history for assessing the disease level of FCMD. To ï¬nd speci ï¬c serum biomarkers and to comprehend natural history of FCMD patients, wecollected serum and clinical data from patients. We tested on serum biomarkers by measuring muscle speci ï¬cmicroRNAs. Clinical data contains motor function score, muscle elastography (shear wave elastography (SWE)), and whole body muscle computed tomography with ultralow level irradiation. As a result, miR206 was signi ï¬cantly overexpressed in FCMD patients compared to normal controls. Correlation coef ï¬cient of miR206 with serum CK level, serum creatinine level, and motor function scores were also high. MiR 206 was especially high in FCMD patients with high muscle contents, suggesting remainingsparing capacity of muscle regeneration. SWE showed signiï¬cantly high elasticity in biceps brachii and brachial muscle but not high in lower extremities in FCMD patients,compared to normal control, because of high content of fat inï¬ltration due to disuse of lower extremities. In conclusion, serum miR206 and SWE is useful for monitoring musclewasting progression and motor function level of FCMD. M. Taniguchi Ikeda: None. R. Harada: None. M. Nagasaka: None. H.

Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumu lation (NBIA) is a heterogeneous group of inheritedneurologic disorders characterized by progressive move ment disorders and abnormal accumulation of iron in the basal ganglia. There are 12 genes that resolve 80% of cases. Our clinical series comprises 134 probands who suffered from NBIA and other movement disorders. After analyzing the NBIA genes, we have achieved the genetic diagnosis in54 cases. The aim of the present study is to establish the molecular bases in patients without mutation in known NBIA genes. Materials and Methods: Thirty eight patients have been studied by a customized gene panel based on SureSelect Technology (Agilent), which comprises 498 genes involvedin NBIA, ataxia, chorea, dystonia, parkinson, spastic ataxia, and spastic paraplegia. Results: We have achieved a de ï¬nite diagnosis in 19 probands. Four of them presented with a neuroimaging phenotype suggestive of NBIA and carried novel mutations inGLB1, FUCA1 and TPP1 , and in one patient born to consanguineous parents, homozygote mutations were identi ï¬ed in two genes, FBOX7 andDLD .1448Conclusions: We have solved 50% of cases. Except for FUCA1 , these are the ï¬rst cases described of NBIA with mutations in GLB1, TPP1 , and DLD/FBXO7 . According new cases are reported, the clinical and genetic spectrum associated with NBIA are expanding.

In mole cular diagnosis, current strategies usually include sequentialinvestigations that may lead to long, tedious, expensive and disappointing patients care. Exome sequencing (ES) appears a promising approach for neurogenetics, apart fromwhen nucleotide motif expansion disorders can be suspected. Materials and Methods: We recruited 48 individuals without cognitive development impairment, referred to our center for suspected neurogenetic disease: 20 cerebellarataxia (42%), 12 neuromuscular diseases (25%), 8 spastic paraplegia (17%), 2 abnormal movements (4%) and 6 others (12%) for whom the phenotype could not be labelled under a usual neurological syndrome. ES was interpreted in a solo based strategy (94%) or in trio with parental pool (6%). Results: ES identi ï¬ed a causal diagnosis in 4/8 indivi duals with spastic paraplegia (50%), 3/6 âother â(50%), 1/2 with abnormal movements (50%), 5/12 with neuromuscular diseases (42%), 4/11 with isolated cerebellar ataxia (37%)and 2/9 with spinocerebellar ataxia (22%). Overall diag nostic yield was of 40 %. Conclusions: With such overall diagnostic yield, this study reinforces the diagnostic interest of ES in neuroge netics, in all its ï¬elds, as this diagnostic yield ranges from 22% in spinocerebellar ataxia (which is higher than currentyield of gene panels) to 50% in spastic paraplegia. It also includes situations in which clinical displays may be com plex and hard to systematize. First tier implementationwould signi ï¬cantly improve diagnostic yield in neurogenetics. Q. H.C.

Alvarez NIMGenetics, Madrid, Spain Introduction: Exome trio analysis is an effective strategy to identify potential causal variants in rare genetic disorders with clinical heterogeneity. In this study, we focused on the 404 probands with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD)with causal variants on chromatin regulating genes to determine their frequency and their genotypic/phenotypic characteristics by trio analysis. Patients and Methods: A cohort of 259 males and 145 females, with a median of 7 years old, was studied by trio whole exome sequencing. Libraries were generated with IonAmpliSeq TMor SureSelectXTand sequenced with IonAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1449ProtonTM/S5TMXL or NovaSeq 6000. The data were pro cessed using an in house pipeline. Results: A genetic diagnosis was established in 129 of the 404 studied probands, leading to a diagnostic yield of 32%. Among the positive cases, 82 and 47 variants, were considered as casual or probably casual, respectively. Ofthat diagnosed patients cohort, 26 probands (20%) had variants in chromatin regulating genes (ARID1B, ATRX, EHMT1, SATB2, SMARCA2, and KMT family). Of the 26variants identi ï¬ed, 58% were loss of function de novo variants associated with an autosomal dominant inheritance. Clinically, these patients shared NDDs phenotypic char acteristics (psychomotor delay and/or autism spectrum dis order) with short stature, dysmorphic features, epilepsy and/ or digital malformations. Conclusions: The haploinsuf ï¬ciency associated with loss of function variants in the genes implicated in the regulation of chromatin played a crucial role in neurodevelopment disorders. These deleterious variants seemed to be asso ciated with a common phenotype. A better delineation of these clinical manifestations could help to better recognizethem in the clinical setting. I.

The progression in diagnosis of neurodevelop mental disorders has undergone considerable in the past decade. In this cohort study we aim to explain our broad research on identi ï¬cation of six novel candidate genes (PPP1R21, ADPRHL2, APC2, SLC10A7, APC2, DEAF1) on the patients with autosomal recessive neurodevelop mental disorders. A complete clinical and paraclinicalexamination has been done by expert specialists and clinical geneticist. Exome Sequencing was performed and followedby bioinformatic analysis. Parents and healthy offspring were assessed for the candidate gene variants. We delineated a novel neurodevelopmental disorders caused by biallelic PPP1R21 loss of function variants, and identi ï¬ed four previously unreported homozygous truncat ing PPP1R21 alleles. Pathogenic variants have beenidenti ï¬ed in a number of patients presenting broad clinical phenotypes with autosomal recessive inheritance. By using linkage analysis and exome or genome sequencing,recessive inactivating mutations in ADPRHL2 in six families have been recognized. It has been demonstrated that SLC10A7 mutations reduce SLC10A7 protein expres sion by in vitro studies. We also described the participation of the APC2 and DEAF1 Genes as potential functional candidates in neurodevelopmental diseases based oncomputational prediction by using several cellular tools. The current focus of our research is on neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autosomal recessive.

Here we present the ï¬rst genetic study of NF1 in R. Macedonia. Material and Methods: Since 2014, a total of 33 patients suspected for NF1 were referred to our laboratory. The methodology included cDNA sequencing, next generation sequencing using Illumina âs TruSight Cancer panel, direct DNA sequencing and multiplex ligation probe ampli ï¬cation. Results: A total of 21 different pathogenic variants were detected in 22 unrelated patients. The variants comprised nine nonsense, six frameshift, two splicing, two missense1450mutations, one multi exon deletion (exons 9 51) and one 1.4 Mb deletion including the entire NF1 gene. All variants were unique, detected in one patient/family with the exception of 1.4 Mb deletion which was detected in two unrelated patients. Genetic testing of family members was available for 20 patients; the NF1 variation was inherited from an affected parent in 11 (55%), while in nine patients (45%) it has arisen as a de novo event. Seven mutations were novel: one nonsense (c.5844C>G, p. Tyr1948Ter) andsix frameshift mutations that cause premature termination of the protein (c.208delA; c.1104_1107delTCAG; c.1480_1481delTT; c.2495_2496dupAC; c.4517delC;c.6971delA). Five of the novel mutations were inherited from an affected parent, while c.2495_2496dupAC and c.6971delA have occurred de novo . Conclusion: Our study presents the NF1 mutational spectrum in R.

Here, we report a childpresenting a neurological disorder characterized by motor and cognitive regression, spastic dystonic tetraparesis, sporadic myoclonus, typical EEG abnormalities and lyso some deposits of granular osmiophilic material with tubular andï¬ngerprint like structures. A diagnosis of NCL wassuspected, but genetic analysis of known NCL genes yielded negative results. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed on genomic DNA of the proband and both parents, upon written informed consent. Variants were aligned, ï¬ltered and prioritized to identify candidate variants. Validation andsegregation analysis were performed with Sanger sequencing. Results: The proband was found to carry a novel het erozygous truncating variant in the IRF2BPL (Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein like) gene, arisen de novo . Very recently, de novo heterozygous variants in this gene have been reported in 18 patients showing neurode generative phenotypes variably de ï¬ned as neurodevelop mental disorders with regression, abnormal movements, loss of speech and seizures or developmental epilepticencephalopathies. Conclusions: This case expands the phenotypic spectrum ofIRF2BPL to include NCL like phenotypes.

Material and Methods: Our study included 49 patients. In all patients molecular karyotyping was performed, fol lowing the medical exome sequencing (Illumina TruSight One capture). Considering the polygenicity of the disorder,we also analysed enrichment of the list of genes harbouring possibly deleterious variants in Gene Ontology terms (GO) by using GeneMania version 3.4.1 Cytoscape plugin. Results: In 12% (6/49) of children a clinically signi ï¬cant CNV was detected, that could be associated with the disorder. In 14% (6/43) of patients pathogenic SNV were detected,although no clear genotype phenotype correlations could be made.

To date the identi ï¬ed genes associated with early onset (EO, >40 years) auto somal recessive (AR) PD only explain 45%, other genesremain to be discovered. The aim of the work is to identify new genes involved in AR EO PD, using consanguineous PD families and applying genotyping on DNA microarraysand NGS technologies. Using a series of 99 families with con ï¬rmed con sanguinity, we looked for homozygous loss of function ormissense mutations predicted deleterious in region of loss of homozygosity. Then we ï¬rst focused on variant shared by at least two families. We identi ï¬ed mutations in PSMF1 an interactor of FBXO7 . In one family, only this variant remains, moreover both mutations code for amino acid highly conserved upon evolution. Most of the candidate âs genes are private genes high lighting genetic heterogeneity of PD. Therefore, in a second time we hypothesized that some candidate âs genes can be involved in a common pathway. Using ClusterPro ï¬ler we performed GO term enrichment analyses, then we were able to grouped together some genes and were able to see anstatistical enrichment in autophagy pathway.

A homozygous missense substitution c.92C>T (p. Ser31Leu) inZNHIT3 was identi ï¬ed as the primary cause of PEHO syndrome in Finland. Case report: The index patient was hospitalised at 1m due to muscular hypotonia and lethargy. Brain MRI showed mildly dilated lateral ventricles, a porencephalic cyst on theleft, hypoplastic occipital lobes and absence of myelin in the cerebellar white matter. At 10m, generalized seizures started (myoclonus and infantile spasms). EEG showed hypsar rhythmia. The child was blind at 17m; she had pale and small disks, and temporal disk pallor. At 8y, she has severe microcephaly ( 4SD), no active movements, severe spasti city, and scoliosis. Her face is edematous with an opened mouth appearance. Brain MRI showed severe cerebral, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy, thin and short corpuscallosum and almost absent periventricular white matter.

Only seven patients carrying pathogenic variants in the NEDD4L gene, associated with PVNH7, were reported so far. We report a polystigmatized 2 year old boy havingsigniï¬cant symptomatologic overlap with PVNH7, how ever, showing also symptoms falling outside PVNH7 symptomatology. His brother presents with someof the probandÂ´s symptoms, speci ï¬cally those falling outside PVNH7 symptomatology. Materials and Methods: The boy, his brother and their parents were subjected to whole exome sequencing. Variant prioritization was performed using an inheritance pattern and phenotype driven top down approach, or by a bottom up approach, beginning with the identi ï¬ed known patho genic variants in the proband âs data. Results: Because of uncertainties in symptomatology and inheritance pattern, the top down approach was hard to apply. The bottom up approach, however, identi ï¬ed a known pathogenic variant, NM_001144967.2(NEDD4L):c.2677G>A:p. Glu893Lys, in the proband âs genome, absenting in any other analyzed family member. This de novo variant explained symptoms overlapping those repor ted for PVNH7, such as delayed psychomotor development and intellectual disability, absenting speech and walking, hypotonia, strabismus, cleft palate, microretrognathia, and2 3 toe syndactyly. Symptoms shared with the brother, on the other hand, were not explained by this variant. These are most probably not extended phenotypes of PVNH7, ratheran independent clinical entity. Conclusion: Our case highlights: 1) the usefulness of a bottom up approach of causative variant identi ï¬cation during differential diagnostics of patients/families having unclear/overlapping phenotypes; 2) the importance of reporting yet undescribed symptoms of known disorders,found in single patients/families, with special care.

In the present study we report a novel clinical case of a 7 year old patient with global development delay and multiply minor dysmorphic features. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed on Ion S5 next generation sequencing system. The identi ï¬ed variant was con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. RT PCR analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from patient ï¬broblasts. HEK293 cells were transfected with minigene plasmid vector containing the variant ofinterest.

Results: Whole exome sequencing revealed a previously undescribed heterozygous variant in the intron 11 of the TCF4 gene NM_001083962: c.922 +5G>C. Segregation analysis showed that the variant is de novo . Functional analysis using two independent approaches: RT PCR ana lysis of total RNA extracted from patient ï¬broblast and a splicing minigene assay, showed that c.922 +5G>C variant disrupt the donor splicing site of the intron 11 leading to a complete skipping of exon 11, resulting in a frame shift and premature stop codon formation p.(Ser264GlnFsTer83).

Several brain MRIs showed non progressive cerebellar atrophy and bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintensity and hypotrophy of both caudate and puta men, resembling striatal necrosis. Blood lactate and MRIspectroscopy were normal. Conclusions: This case further expands the clinical spectrum associated with PMPCA mutations to include a complex encephalopathy without obvious mitochondrial involvement. The association of non progressive cerebellar atrophy with bilateral striatal hyperintensity may represent aâredï¬agâfor this genetic condition.

30574,"F. Fogolari2, A. Maver1, B. Peterlin11Clinical institute of Medical Genetics, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2University of Udine, Udine, Italy The pontocerebellar hypoplasias (PCH) represent a hetero geneous group of conditions characterized by structural abnormalities of central nervous system, typically involvingcerebellum and ventral pons. In the present study, we propose a novel association between biallelic variants in ATOH1 and PCH with severe neurodevelopmental dis order. We report a family with two children affected with pontocerebellar dysplasia, severe motor and speech delay and sensorineural hearing loss. Using exome sequencing,we identi ï¬ed a homozygous rare missense variant in ATOH1 in both affected probands. ATOH1 encodes atonal bHLH transcription factor 1, a core neurogenic transcriptionfactor that regulates cell differentiation in cerebellum, drives development of inner ear hair cells and is essential in development of neurosensory systems. Disruption of Atoh1in mouse models was previously shown to result in severe cerebellar hypoplasia and hearing loss. The identi ï¬ed variant (NM_005172.1:c.481C>G, p. Arg161Gly) substi tutes a highly conserved residue in the DNA binding domain of Atoh1. It is absent from control populations of the gnomAD project and our in house database of 3000exomes. We performed molecular modelling, which predicted that this change can affect DNA binding af ï¬nity of Atoh1 through distortion of its contacts to DNA andthrough remodelling of the helical part of HLH domain. In conclusion, we report a novel potential genetic cause of developmental brain anomalies, due to mutations inATOH1. Although the evidence is currently too limited to conclusively establish its causality, this report may present basis for further studies on the role of ATOH1 in human disease. T. Vi Å¡njar: None. K.

The apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. The risk of APOE in AD varies with age. This age related genetic heterogeneity has been shown in the Alzheimer âs Disease Genetics Consortium data; there is little genetic correlation between two age groups (60 79 years vs. 80 +years) and the heritability explained by SNPs on chromosome 19 was larger at younger ages. We aim to further demonstrate that APOE impacts the risk of AD in younger subjects, whereas older subjects are inï¬uenced by the polygenic effect of variants outside the APOE region. The UK Biobank data is a large (N ,443,019) prospective cohort of individuals containing genetic data for 7,654,308imputed SNPs. Individuals in Biobank are relatively young, with only 92 AD cases. Polygenic risk score (PRS) is a method to combine the effect of genetic variants. Wecomputed the PRS for individuals in Biobank, using sum mary statistics from the largest AD GWAS to weight the score. AD PRS shows an association with AD, but this effect is removed when the PRS excludes chromosome 19. When considering family proxies of AD; sibling proxies show thesame pattern, however, parental proxies remain associated with PRS even after the removal of chromosome 19. This is similarly shown in biological pathways; beta amyloid reg ulation, protein lipid complex and APP regulation. This is also demonstrated using age strati ï¬ed analyses which dis play a stronger association with AD and higher mean PRSin AD cases in the older cohort. E. A. Baker: None. M. Bracher Smith: None.

A previous longitudinal study of our group found 66 genes differen tially expressed in the blood of youths who presented an increase of dimensional psychopathology after a 3 year follow up. These genes were exclusively found in the groupwith the emergence of psychopathology and were not differentially expressed in the longitudinal control groups. Here, we aimed to identify whether the gene expression ofthese 65 genes were in ï¬uenced by changes in DNA methylation in the blood of the same individuals. Moreover, for those markers associated with gene expression, weveriï¬ed whether DNA methylation was in ï¬uenced by adversities experienced by the youths during the 3 year follow up. Then, we compared gene expression and DNAmethylation data in peripheral blood samples (n ,44) obtained from 22 youths before and after developing severe psychopathology. Life adversities variables were generatedby using a latent modelling approach with a bifactor structure. We identi ï¬ed 11 differentially expressed genes regulated by DNA methylation. Among these 11 genes, themethylation of LMF2 andETS1 was in ï¬uenced by factors describing adversities related to interpersonal, context change, school, health/loss and unpredictable events. Also,these in ï¬uences persisted when modelling a general adversity factor. LMF2 methylation has been associated with Alzheimer's disease and ETS1 is a transcriptional factor involved in downstream biological pathways. These results provide further evidence that life adversities and the emergence of psychopathology are functionally linked bychanges in DNA methylation and, consequently, in gene expression. L. M.

Prediction of the emergence of psychosis and dimensional clinicaloutcomes is important for early intervention. The results of recent large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) expanded our knowledge of the genetic factorsand suggested a polygenic model of inheritance of psychiatric disorders. We aimed to test if the individual polygenic risk scores (PRS) could predict for conversion topsychosis and dimensional outcomes and if the converters to psychosis have polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders. Materials and Methods: In the French cohort ICAAR, we collected longitudinal data of 104 individuals with at risk mental state enrolled in a 1 year follow up study. Clinical assessments included CAARMS, PANSS,MADRS, YMRS, SOFAS and CGI. The conversion to psychosis was characterized using the CAARMS de ï¬ned psychosis onset threshold. We genotyped more than500,000 common variants and computed four different PRS based on the data of four GWAS from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Results: The PRS from currently available GWAS were poor predictors of the conversion to psychosis, and there was no signi ï¬cant difference between converters and non converters. The PRS were not correlated with any pheno typic scale at the baseline measurement (M0) and at the last measurement (after 6 months or 12 months). Conclusion: The PRS cannot be used in clinical practice to predict the individual risk of conversion to psychosis. Further studies are needed to examine the correlationbetween genetic variance and clinical outcomes in psy chiatric disorders. Q. He: None. O. Kebir: None. G. Houle: None. P. A. Dion: None. G. A.

30578,"disorder for which different genes and environmental elements are considered risk factors. Such a mixed nature makes it challenging to characterize the defective pathwaysassociated with the condition. Here we conducted a genome wide transcriptome (RNA Seq) study and observed how the gene reported to present the most signi ï¬cant association with RLS, MEIS1 , acts as a regulator over the expression of additional genes. Interestingly these addi tional genes appear to entail some of the pathogenicpathways known to be linked to RLS. Our data revealed HMOX1 ,TFR2 and VDR , three genes encoding products with RLS relevant functions, to be regulated by MEIS1 inhuman cells where the expression of MEIS1 was either increased or prevented. These manipulations of MEIS1 in cells revealed mineral absorption to be an enriched pathwayin regard to MEIS1 regulatory role as a transcription factor. The same enrichment is observed in postmortem brain regions (thalamus and pons) obtained from a subset of RLSpatients presenting changes in MEIS1 expression. The expression of genes encoding metallothioneins (MTs) was observed to be affected across the different RNA Seqdatasets. MTs are highly relevant to RLS as they bind intracellular metals and interact with ferritins which manage iron levels. Overall, our study suggests that in a subset ofpatients, the contribution of MEIS1 to RLS is associated to its transcriptional regulation of other genes more directly involved in cellular pathways relevant to RLS.

However, not much is known about which pathways can be disrupted in RTT downstream MeCP2dysfunction. Nevertheless, recent studies demonstrate the possible implication of a disturbance in inhibitory circuits, especially of the GABAergic inhibitory neurons, in RTTpathophysiology. Methods: This work analyses changes in expression of the most common subunits of GABA(A) ionotropic recep tors in different models of RTT ( in vitro cell culture and in vivo mouse model) by shRNA knock down, qRT PCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry, as well as in post mortem brain samples of RTT patients by RNAseq, with the aim of ï¬nding a suitable therapeutic target for treating RTT. Results: We observed a direct relationship between MeCP2 and GABA (A) receptor subunit a1 (Gabra1) expression in cell lines and primary cultured neurons. Pro tein analyses of female Mecp2 +/ and control mice at dif ferent developmental stages con ï¬rmed our previous ï¬ndings and pointed towards the importance of the devel opmental status in this relationship, highlighting synapticprotein expression changes in presymptomatic stages of RTT. RNAseq results in brain samples of RTT patients conï¬rmed the importance of the time frame when studying RTT unbalanced neurotransmission. Conclusions: Our results strongly support Gabra1 as a novel therapeutic target for treating RTT. Protein expressionchanges in presymptomatic stages of RTT highlight the importance of early therapeutic strategies targeting neuro transmission.

30580,"Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada Neonatal Lethal Rigidity and Multifocal Seizure Syndrome (RMFSL) is a rare autosomal recessive condition character ized by intractable seizures, hypertonia, autonomic instabil ity and early death. Mutations in BRAT1 (Breast Cancer 1 associated ataxia telangiectasia mutated activation 1) have been associated with severe RMFSL as well as relatedphenotypes of varying clinical severity. We report on a female baby who presented with mild dysmorphic features, striking hypertonicity, seizures with a burst suppressionpattern on EEG and apneic spells shortly after birth who died at 2 months of age. Chromosomal microarray analysis using a combined non polymorphic /SNP probe basedplatform (Affymetrix CytoScan HD) did not identify any copy number variations but several stretches of absence of heterozygosity (AOH) were identi ï¬ed including a region on chromosome 7p22.3p22.1. As BRAT1 is contained within this region and the clinical phenotype was suggestive of RMFSL, BRAT1 sequencing was performed. A homozy gous, previously unreported pathogenic mutation (c.1013dupC) was identi ï¬ed, con ï¬rming the diagnosis of RFMSL. To our knowledge, this is the seventh report ofRFMSL due to a homozygous BRAT1 mutation in the literature, and the ï¬rst one reported in a family of French Acadian background from Atlantic Canada. This casedemonstrates the utility of SNP based microarrays which can detect regions of AOH and help narrow the differential diagnosis and approach to subsequent diagnosticinvestigations. L. Li: None.

In this study, it was aimed to observe how the levels ofdifferent miRNAs in the frontal lobes of experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) induced rats were changed in different time intervals Materials and Methods: Adult female Sprague Dawley rats (n,21) are divided into 3 groups: control group (n ,7), 7th day post SAH group (n ,7) and 14th day post SAH group (n ,7). Experimental SAH was induced in SAH groups. The levels of miR 132, miR 134 and miR 138 in the frontal lobes were determined by qPCR and statisticaldifferences were calculated using one way ANOVA test. Results: A statistically signi ï¬cant increase in expression levels of miR 132,miR 134 and miR 138 was observed onday7 post SAH (p<0,001). On the 14th day, it was deter mined that the level of miRNAs which were increased earlier, decreased to the control values (p>0.05). Conclusions: Expressions of microRNAs are elevated during 1 7 days post SAH, and decreased again in the interval of 7 14 days. These results show that miR 132,miR 134 and miR 138 levels were affected during the ï¬rst week of recovery post SAH. This increase in microRNA levels, which have different effects on synaptic connections,in the short term after SAH may play a role in the inaccurate arrangement of synaptic structures and in the emergence of neurological dysfunctions.

A GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron1 ofthe NOP56 gene causing RNA gain of function is responsible for the disease. Normal size alleles vary from 3 to 14 repeats, pathogenic alleles have more than 650 repeats, and intermediate alleles are of uncertain signiï¬cance. Materials and Methods: Our cohort consisted of 98 selected index patients. 92 patients came from an ataxia cohort (n ,600), negative for the most common SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7), with pedigree andphenotype consistent with SCA36 and 6 came from a sus pected Kennedy âs disease cohort (n ,200), negative for the CAG trinucleotide repeat in ARand pedigree consistent with SCA36. The number of GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeats was determined with conventional PCR for the smaller alleles and RP PCR for the larger alleles. Fragmentlength analysis was performed and positive controls were used in every run. Results: No pathologic repeat expansions in NOP56 were detected in our cohort. Conclusion: Supplementary to our previous study of AD spinocerebellar ataxias in the Greek population, wescreened a less common gene causing inherited ataxia.

Weidenti ï¬ed two unrelated cases diagnosed with both COS and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), a rare diseasecharacterized by repeated episodes of hemiplegia. Genes associated with AHC are known and guided our genetic exploration of these two patients using the targeted sequencing of the ATP1A3 gene. Then, we replicated our ï¬ndings in a database of whole exome sequencing of 17 independent COS cases. In the cases with comorbid AHC,two distinct pathogenic de novo variants were identi ï¬ed in the ATP1A3 gene. In the replication cohort, we identi ï¬ed a third case with a possibly damaging missense variant in thesame exon of ATP1A3. Three other cases with predicted pathogenic missense variants in the FXYD gene family (FXYD1, FXYD6, and FXYD6 FXYD2 readthrough) werefound. ATP1A3 encodes the Î± subunit of a neuron speci ï¬c ATP dependent transmembrane sodium potassium pump. The function of this pump is modulated by proteins encodedby the FXYD genes.

While the heritability of schizo phrenia is around 80%, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways are still unclear. To investigate pathways associated with schizophrenia, we performedgene expression study and we are now following up by measurement of protein expression.1460Materials and Methods: Whole transcriptome poly A selected paired end RNA sequencing was performed on post mortem brain tissue samples from 68 schizophrenia patients and 44 matched controls. Differential RNA expression was detected between cases and controls. The results were validated with RT qPCR. Expression analysisfor >100 proteins is currently under way using proximity extension assay. Results: Signi ï¬cant differential expression was found for 71 genes in cases compared to unaffected controls. Gene ontology of differentially expressed genes revealed an up regulation of multiple genes in immune response among thepatients as the most signi ï¬cant category. Several genes of complement system, including C1R, C1S, C7 ,FCN3 and SERPING1 were also in the category. The increased com plement expression was stronger in a subgroup of patients which might be due to differences in disease etiology within patients. Speci ï¬c proteins were also associated with dif ferential expression in this subgroup of patients. Weighted gene co expression network analysis highlighted networks associated with synaptic transmission and activation ofimmune response.

Reports so far, suggest that sodium channel blockers (SCBs) have a positive effect on seizure in SCN8A related epilepsy. In this overview, we sought to describe the complete phenotypic spectrum, provide novel data on functional studies, as well as evaluate treatment response in thepatients suffering from epilepsy. Methods: Clinical information on cognitive status, epi lepsy onset, epilepsy type and treatment response was col lected via standardized spreadsheets. Clinicians and geneticists worldwide participated in the study. Previously published cases were included via a PubMed search. Allpatients signed informed consent, and the study was approved by the local ethical committee. Results: In total, we investigated 36 previously unpub lished patients, and 246 patients in total. We found ï¬ve distinct clinical subgroups; BFNIS, intermediate epilepsy, DEE, severe DEE (non ambulant, no speech, corticalblindness) and patients without epilepsy. The DEE sub groups comprise 74% of the total cohort. SCBs were the most ef ï¬cient anti epileptic drug. Several recurrent variants were found. Some of these variants showed a persistent phenotype and others not. The underlying reasons for this remain unexplained. Conclusion: The phenotypic range of SCN8A is wide ranging from self limiting epilepsies to severe DEEs, and also including patients without epilepsy. Phenotypic varia bility within the same genetic variants are common, so genetic counselling must be done carefully. SCBs should be ï¬rst line treatment in SCN8A related epilepsy. K. M.

That is why theSLC1A4 gene is not routinely included in the genetic diagnostic panels for neurological diseases or epilepsy. Patients and Methods: Here we present a 5 year old Czech boy with microcephaly, severe psychomotor retardation and intractable seizures who remained unsolved using clinicalexperience and standard diagnostic methods including examination by an epilepsy targeted gene panel. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was ï¬nally used to obtain genetic diagnosis. Results: A novel mutation, p. Arg457Gln (c.1370G>A) of theSLC1A4 gene, was detected in homozygous state by WES in the patient, and afterwards by Sanger sequencing in heterozygous state in both parents con ï¬rming the biallelic origin of the mutation. This variant is not reported in ExAC/gnomAD databases in homozygous state, in heterozygous state in a very low frequency (0.002%), it affects a highly conserved aminoacid predicted to be deleterious. Mutationin the same codon but different aminoacid exchange was previously described in a patient with very similar pheno type, however, without epilepsy. Our patient suffers frommicrocephaly, global developmental delay, axial hypotonia with acral spasticity, brain and corpus callosum atrophy, impaired visual function and drug resistant epilepsy. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the SLC1A4 gene should be considered in the diagnosis of patients with severe early onset neurodevelopmental impairment withepilepsy and encourages SLC1A4 gene variants âanalysis1462via targeted gene panel or WES.

So far sixty nine gene loci have been reported to be involved in autosomal recessive non syndromic intellectual disability (NS ARID). Materials and Methods: A novel disease locus was identi ï¬ed using homozygosity by descent (HBD) mapping coupled with whole exome sequencing in a large con sanguineous Pakistani family. On the cellular level, the impact of the novel mutation on protein expression was characterized in subcellular colocalization experiments. Results: Herein this study, HBD mapping identi ï¬ed a single shared homozygous region on chromosome 13 between markers rs9531043 to rs7318889. The subsequentexome sequence analysis identi ï¬ed a novel SLITRK1 gene mutation, which segregated with the disease phenotype. SLITRK1 is an adhesion molecule located in the post synaptic membrane of excitatory synapses. Cellular assays showed that the identi ï¬ed novel mutation results in loss of protein function by trapping mutated SLITRK1 intracellu larly in the endoplasmic reticulum and thus preventing surface transport and ligand binding. Additionally, several reported mutations showing decreased surface expression ofSLITRK1 were selected for colocalization analysis. We proof that all variants are transported into the plasma membrane with the exception of SLITRK1 harboring the novel mutation. Conclusions: SLITRK1 has previously been associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, ourï¬ndings suggest a possible, to date unreported, association of SLITRK1 in NS ARID. Thus, in the light of our ï¬ndings,the gene âs implication in complex neuropsychiatric dis orders should be re evaluated. M. A. Khan: None. J. Blatterer: None. M. Z. Ali: None. L. Baufeld: None.

Familial cases suggestgenetic components, however monogenetic causes are few and the vast majority of incidences have unknown cause. Sequencing efforts have focused on germline mutations, butimproved technology has opened up for studies on somatic mutations in affected brain tissue samples. Here we use ultra deep sequencing on brain and blood from early andlate onset AD patients, and non AD individuals (n ,16). In total 2.86 Megabases of genomic regions, previously associated with AD was targeted, included 28 genes andupstream and downstream regulatory regions. Tailored downstream bioinformatics ï¬ltering identi ï¬ed 11 somatic single nucleotide variants in the temporal cortex in ADpatients and none in the controls. One variant was validated to be present at 0.4% allele frequency in temporal cortex of a late onset AD patient. This variant was predicted to affecttranscription factor binding sites upstream of the CD55 gene, contributing to AD pathogenesis by affecting the complement system. Our results suggest that future studiestargeting larger portions of the genome for somatic mutation analysis are important to obtain an increased understanding for the molecular basis of both early and late onset AD.

The variant is expected to cause a premature termination resulting in afunctionally null allele. DDHD1 encodes phospholipase A 1 (PA PLA 1), an enzyme catalyzing phosphatidylinositol (PI) to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). Towards the clari ï¬cation of the pathogenic mechanism of SPG28, we established Ddhd1 knockout (KO) mice carrying a 1 bp deletion in exon 2i n Ddhd1 , resulting in a frameshift and premature termination at the very similar position with the patient. Since we observed no obvious abnormalities in their locomotion, we measured foot base angle (FBA) which isan established character to evaluate SPG phenotypes. We observed a signi ï¬cant decrease of FBA in the homozygous KOs, as a partial replication of SPG phenotypes. By RNAsequencing, we identi ï¬ed 22 genes showing signi ï¬cantly changed expressions in cerebrum of the homozygous KOs. The 22 genes are characterized by a GO term, âpositive regulation of GTPase activity âand a KEGG pathway, âNF kappa B signaling pathway â. By lipidome analyses using supercritical ï¬uid chromatography mass spectrometry (SFC/ MS) we observed signi ï¬cant increase of PI and signi ï¬cant decrease of LPI in cerebrum of the homozygous KOs. LPI is known to be the agonist for a G protein coupled receptor,GPR55 triggering mobilization of intracellular Ca 2+. Our current data suggest the mechanism of SPG that the reduced LPI level in cerebrum triggers abnormal reduction ofintracellular Ca 2+, resulting in neural apoptosis by abnormal NF kappa B signaling.

Speci ï¬c language impairment (SLI) is de ï¬ned as an unexpected and persistent impairment in language ability despite adequate social environment and intelligence and inthe absence of any explanatory medical conditions. This condition is highly heritable and affects around 7% of pre school children. Materials and Methods: The study aimed to examine gene expression pro ï¬ling in the peripheral blood of 60 individuals divided into two groups: children with SLI andage and gender matched healthy controls. A genome wide sequencing of copy DNA molecules was conducted in the pooled probes of the two groups investigating the quanti tative expression of the genes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway based analysis was used to further understand genes âbiological functions. Results: As a result of the conducted expression analysis, 60 differentially expressed genes and 7 KEGG signaling pathways with statistical signi ï¬cant change were identi ï¬ed. The KEGG names of these pathways were: ""Hepatitis C"", ""Herpes simplex infection"", ""Leukocyte transendothelial migration"", ""Primary immunode ï¬ciency"", ""Calcium sig naling pathway"" and ""Tight junction"". Conclusions: Clear and signi ï¬cant abnormalities exist in the gene expression in peripheral blood samples of childrenwith SLI compared to healthy controls. We suggest that not only cellular signaling but immune mechanisms may also be involved in the pathogenesis of SLI. I. Y. Hristo: None. I. G. Sotkova Ivanova: None. T. Vachev: None. N. Popov: None. I.

Due to extensive clinicaloverlap among different forms of hereditary ataxia (>35 subtypes known), genetic testing is required to establish a diagnosis. The most common causes of SCAsare expansions of trinucleotide CAG repeats within genes ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7 and CACNA1A . Next generation sequencing (NGS) assays have abled to delineateother types of hereditary ataxias caused by other variant types. The aim of this study was to clarify which types of SCAs are most prevalent in Estonia and to compare thediagnostic yield of trinucleotide repeat assay and (NGS) panel. Patients and methods: The SCA repeat expansion assay was performed in 317 Estonian patients referred to the Tartu University Hospital during the years 2000 2018. All indi viduals were tested for triplet expansions in ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A genes with PCR based frag ment analysis, and since 2012 ATXN7 was added to the standard panel. Since 2016, 72 patients were studied usingNGS based panel (Illumina TruSight One) with ataxia subpanel (151 genes included). Results: In 35 (11.0%) patients, repeat extension (34 SCA2 cases, 1 SCA1 case) was detected. From NGS based panel testing, 7 (9.7%) diagnostic ï¬ndings were reported in 6 different genes ( PRKCG, TGM6, ITPR1, SACS ,2 x ANO10 , and XPA). Conclusion: The most prevalent form of SCAs in Estonia is SCA2. Triplet repeat expansion assay and NGS panelsequencing showed similar diagnostic yields, but it is more cost ef ï¬cient to start with repeat expansion assay.

However, AAO variability is not entirely explained by the length of the repeat, suggesting the existence of additional modifyingfactors. Materials and Methods: To examine the residual variability in AAO, a genome wide association study(GWAS) was conducted across a cohort of 700 SCA3 cases from North America, Brazil and Portugal. The ï¬rst phase of the study established the CAG repeat size in cases as itassessed the proportion of AAO variability that could be accounted to the repeat size. In the second phase, a linear regression analysis tested for genomic factors affecting theresidual AAO. Results: The inverse relationship between CAG repeat size and AAO was con ï¬rmed ( Ï,0.62). No loci reached genome wide signi ï¬cance but eight suggestive loci (p<1Ã10 5). We also observed 80 loci with a p<1Ã10 4; some of which revealed associations with genes causingother forms of ataxia. The later would be good candidates for the AAO of SCA3. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst GWAS to focus on the identi ï¬cation of variants that could reveal modi ï¬ers of AAO in SCA3. We con ï¬rmed the known inverse correlation between CAG repeat size and AAO as we provided evi dence for other modifying factors.

The aim of this work was tofollow oculomotor and cognitive changes over time in unaffected premanifest SCAs carriers. Materials and Methods: As part of the RISCA study, we assessed preclinical SCA1 2 3 carriers and non carriers at baseline and at 72 months follow up. Distance between Oculomotor Patterns (DOP) were determined by combiningvalues of standard deviation from the norm of prosaccades latency, velocity and gain for leftward and rightward pro saccade, antisaccade latencies and square wave jerks(pathological if >4) and correlated with cognitive outcomes. Quantitative motor battery and volumetric MRI were performed. Results: There were 16 carriers (3 SCA1 carriers, 4 SCA2 carriers, 9 SCA3 carriers) and 16 non carriers,similar in age (mean age at baseline 35.7Â±7.8), quantitative cerebellar functional score (CCFS), cognitive evaluation (MMS, BREF and Stroop) and DOP at the baseline. Inter estingly, SARA score at baseline was below ï¬ve but higher in carriers (1.47Â±0.85 vs 0.78Â±0.72, p<0.05). At follow up, DOP increased from 2.2Â±1.7 to 2.2Â±3.8 in non carriers andfrom 3.5Â±3.6 to 8.2Â±8.2 in carriers (p<0.05). For the con verters with SARA>5, mean DOP reached 12.5Â±8.2 while it remained at 3.3Â±5.3 in non converters (p ,<0.01). There was a positive correlation between DOP and CCFS (p,0.01) and SARA (p ,0.001). No changes in cognitive assessments were found at follow up. Conclusions: DOP and CCFS re ï¬ect disease conversion and are independent from the rater thus more reliable in pre symptomatic carriers.

The predominant genetic causes are mutations in thegenes GLRA1 andGLRB , encoding glycine receptor alpha and beta subunits, respectively, and SLC6A5 encoding the glycine transporter GlyT2. The disease has hallmarkcharacteristics of noise or touch induced non epileptic seizures resulting in muscle stiffness and apnea. However,1466cases are often misdiagnosed as spastic quadriplegia or epilepsy. Our study focuses on likely disease causative mutations in startle disease patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Sanger sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and targeted next generation sequencing were conducted in ï¬fteen patients. Functional analysis of selected variants was performed using whole cell recordings and confocal micro scopy in acutely transfected N2A cells. We identi ï¬ed one novel (p. A455P) and two (p.

There is limited knowledge regarding thepathogenic role of mutant CHIP in vivo . This study aims to establish a zebra ï¬sh model for SCAR16 by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis of the zebra ï¬sh orthologue of human STUB1 . Material and Methods: Single guide RNAs targeting a 20 nucleotide sequence in stub1 gene were injected together with Cas9 proteins into wild type zebra ï¬sh embryos at one cell stage. Offspring ï¬sh were analyzed for transmitted germline mutations. The expression of CHIPprotein was also examined in WT ï¬sh brain using immunohistochemistry. Results: All injected eggs showed high frequency of modiï¬cations at the stub1 locus at 48 hours post injection. F1 heterozygous carriers with a 7 nucleotide deletions at position 10800 in the stub1 gene were produced from the founder ï¬sh, and further used to obtain homozygous off spring. Immunohistochemistry studies provided initial evi dences regarding localization of CHIP protein in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of WT ï¬sh. Conclusions: We here described the use of CRISPR/ Cas9 system to induce modi ï¬cations of the stub1 gene in zebra ï¬sh and contribute to establishing a new animal model for studying STUB1 related ataxia diseases.

Conclusions: A new subcategory of susceptibility factor is proposed for these CNVs classi ï¬ed in the VOUS group. Its clinical signi ï¬cance is subject to the penetrance and expression in each individual. Given the wide hetero geneity, the clinical geneticist must decide if the CNV isresponsible for the phenotype and determine if the family segregation study is necessary. N. Baena: None. E.

In patients withcharacteristic behaviors, developmental delays, speech impairment and seizures, speci ï¬c EEG patterns have been proposed as having relative speci ï¬city for Angelman. Here we report on two patients with Angelman associated phenotypes and EEG ï¬ndings who were ultimately diagnosed with SYNGAP1 syndrome. Materials and Methods: Patient 1 is a female with infantile onset oropharyngeal dysphagia, hypotonia, global developmental delays, and early childhood epilepsy. EEGï¬ndings appeared to suggest Angelman syndrome, how ever, targeted testing was negative. Further molecular test ing con ï¬rmed a pathogenic variant in SYNGAP1. Patient 2 is a male with similar history of oropharyngeal dysphagia, hypotonia, global developmental delays, and childhood onset epilepsy in addition to tremors and ataxia. EEG ï¬ndings showed patterns suggestive of Angelman, with a ï¬nal diagnosis of SYNGAP1 syndrome. Results: Patient 1 EEG: rhythmic posterior delta slowing with embedded spikes, generalized epileptiform activityPatient 1 molecular testing (via Whole Exome Sequen cing): De Novo, SYNGAP1 p. Q1106X Patient 2 EEG: Rhythmic posterior notched delta slowing increased with eye closure, generalized and left central focal epileptiform activity Patient 2 molecular testing (via Whole Exome Sequen cing): De Novo, SYNGAP1 p. R967X Conclusions: Given the degree of clinical and EEG ï¬nding overlap, SYNGAP1 syndrome should be considered in patients with an Angelman like phenotype. A. K. Petersen: None. A. Golden: None. K.

Despite theearly identi ï¬cation of multiple loci on chromosomes 8, 2 and 5, the genetic basis of this condition has remained elusive for 20 years. Recently, intronic expansions ofATTTT/ATTTC pentanucleotide repeats in SAMD12 on chromosome 8 have been identi ï¬ed as a major cause of FAME in Asia. Methods and Results: In this study, we used genome sequencing (Illumina, short read technology) and repeat primed PCR to identify a new expanded site in MARCH6 on chromosome 5p15 in four European families. Further ana lysis of single DNA molecules using long read nanopore sequencing and, in parallel, molecular combing combinedwithï¬uorescent staining of the ATTTC repeats and ï¬anking regions, revealed that the expansions range on average from 4 to 13 kb. However, we observed a high variability inexpansion length and structure, compatible with the exis tence of different expansion con ï¬gurations in the blood cells of the same individual. Moreover, the largest expan sions were associated with complex microrearrangements occurring at the expanded site in up to 20% of the cells. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence that FAME is homogeneously caused by intronic ATTTT/ ATTTC expansions in distinct genes and shows that expansions exhibit a high somatic instability that can ulti mately result in genomic rearrangements.

30599,"An autosomal dominant type of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), SCA35, has been associated with pathogenic mutations in the gene TGM6. In a Chinese exomesequencing cohort with 116 indexes and 135 asymptomatic parents, we identi ï¬ed 8 families with reported TGM6 variants sharing no features of SCA35. Considering thisï¬nding, we reviewed the public database gnomAD, these reported pathogenic variants are signi ï¬cantly more com monly found in the East Asians than in other ethnic groups(P<0.0001). Bioinformatics analysis of gene constraint showed that both missense and loss of function variants in TGM6 are likely to be tolerated with no regional constraint. By performing in ï¬ation analysis to empirically evaluate the pathogenicity of TGM6, it is found that there is an over representation of reported pathogenic variants in thepopulation. The cumulative frequency of reported patho genic TGM6 variants is at least 111 fold in ï¬ated over the combined prevalence of all autosomal dominant SCAs(<5.6 per 100,000), indicating a high chance of misdiag nosis or very low penetrance. Misclassi ï¬cation of benign or low penetrant variants as pathogenic is a signi ï¬cant problem that often results in genetic misdiagnosis and premature ending of diagnostic odyssey. This highlights the necessity of evaluating variant pathogenicity with sequencing ofgenomes from diverse populations, both from asymptomatic controls and phenotypically different patients, in order to ensure accurate classi ï¬cation of variants.

Deletion of TTL in mice causes perinatal death due to a strong accumulation of detyrosinated Î± tubulin in the brain, which leads to massive aberrations in brain development. More over, TTL has recently been demonstrated to be crucial for post injury axon regeneration. Materials and Methods: We describe two sisters from healthy consanguineous parents, presenting with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, cerebellarataxia, hypotonia and microcephaly. Brain MRI ï¬ndings was suggestive of a tubulinopathy, showing dysmorphic basal ganglia, commissural agenesis or hypoplasia, dys plasia of the cerebellar vermis and brainstem. After excluding mutations in tubulin genes, whole exome sequencing analysis was performed. Results: Both siblings shared the homozygous missense variant c.1013G>A (Cys338Thr) in the TTL gene (NM_153712.4). The variant was predicted as pathogenicby all prediction software and was absent from population databases. Molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that the mutant protein is more ï¬exible than wild type, which could lead to impaired interaction with Î± tubulin, and thus, impaired enzymatic function. Indeed, enzymatic activity assays showed that mutant TTL protein is inactive,while patient ï¬broblasts show signi ï¬cantly higher levels of detyrosinated Î± tubulin compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: We report the ï¬rst recessively inherited tubulinopathy like disorder, caused by biallelic loss of function mutations in the TTL gene.

VPS13C was identi ï¬ed as a risk factor for PD in GWAS, and premature termination codon (PTC) mutations inVPS13C were associated with recessive PD. We identi ï¬ed in whole genome sequencing data of a recessive early onset age LBD family (AAO: 41 42 years) compound hetero zygous VPS13C missense mutations reducing VPS13C protein expression. Materials and Methods: Targeted resequencing of cod ingVPS13C in 230 LBD patients (AAO: 70.8Â±9.7 years), 612 PD patients (AAO: 60.5Â±11.1 years) and 663 control individuals (AAI: 72.0Â±9.4 years). Protein analysis wasperformed in lymphoblast cells and brain lysates of LBD compound heterozygous VPS13C mutations carriers. Results: We identi ï¬ed 4 LBD carries of compound het erozygous missense mutations in VPS13C . Two mutant alleles decreased protein expression by near 90% in lym phoblast cells. VPS13C reduction was also observed inautopsy brain of two LBD carriers. In the PD cohort, we identi ï¬ed 7 patients compound heterozygous (splice site/ missense or missense/missense) and 1 patient homozygous(missense) for VPS13C mutations. In control individuals, we observed 6 carriers of compound heterozygous muta tions of which 3 shared the same variants suggesting cis conï¬guration. Trans /cisposition of the heterozygous VPS13C alleles are being determined by long read sequencing on VPS13C cDNA. Conclusion: Our genetic and expression data suggest that alsoVPS13C missense mutations contribute to risk for LBD or PD by loss of function mechanism. Additional functionalstudies will be needed to understand the contribution of the different mutated VPS13C alleles to LBD and PD. S. Smolders: None. S. Philtjens: None. D. Crosiers: None. S.

Here we demonstrate the power of using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify pathogenic variants in NDDs,in one of the largest studies to date. WGS was performed on 691 individuals (488 affected and 201 unaffected relatives). Initially, pathogenic variants were identi ï¬ed in 31% individuals, and 21% had a variant of uncertain signi ï¬ cance. Reanalysis of the data two years later increased the yield to 36% and 23% respectively. Of all reported variants,90% were SNVs/indels in coding regions of NDD associated genes. However, WGS provided power to detect three additional categories of variants: structural, intronicand mitochondrial variants. Structural variants (SVs) comprised 25 deletions, 6 duplications, 2 inversions, one partial uniparental isodisomy and one complex SV. Nanopore long read WGS was used to resolve the genetic architecture of SVs that could not be resolved by othermethods. Furthermore, 7 pathogenic intronic variants were identi ï¬ed, as well as 3 likely pathogenic variants in the mitochondrial genome. This study demonstrates the value of using WGS to investigate the genetic causes of NDD as a single pass investigation. It also corroborates previous reports that reanalysis of data allows more patients toreceive genetic diagnoses. WGS provides comprehensive and unbiased coverage facilitating identi ï¬cation of all types of variants throughout the human nuclear and mitochondrialgenome. Importantly, this includes variants that would not have been identi ï¬ed using the more commonly used whole exome sequence approach. A. Sanchis Juan: None. C. Armirola: None. K. Megy: None. K.

With increased access to whole exome sequencing (WES), new candidate genes are beingidenti ï¬ed. YWHAG (*605356) on Chr 7q11.23 encodes for YWHAG, from the 14 3 3 protein family, playing impor tant roles in signal transduction and cellular proliferation. YWHAG is highly expressed in brain, skeletal and heart muscle. Mouse models suggest alterations in Ywhag level cause delayed neuronal migration and interstitial deletionsat Chr 7q11.23 result in infantile seizures and cardiomyo pathy, suggesting haploinsuf ï¬ciency as an explanation. Materials and Methods: We present 12 patients with YWHAG de novo missense variants. We describe a syn dromal phenotype, report novel and a recurrent p. Arg132 CysYWHAG variant and compare developmental trajectory and treatment strategies in this cohort. Patients 1 9 had WES via Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study. Patients 10 12 were identi ï¬ed via Genematcher and AnnEX databases. De novo variants from exome data were vali dated using Sanger sequencing. Results: 12/12 patients in the cohort have de novo , het erozygous missense variants in YWHAG including 4/12 patients with a recurrent c.394C >T, p. Arg132Cys variant. Characteristic features included: early onset seizures, pre dominantly generalised tonic clonic and absence type with good response to standard anti epileptic medications; DD; Intellectual Disability (ID) and a recognisable facial gestalt. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings support the hypothesis that YWHAG loss of function causes a neurological phenotype. Although the exact mechanism of YWHAG is not fullyknown, it is likely that YWHAG haploinsuf ï¬ciency in developing cerebral cortex leads to abnormal neuronal migration resulting in DEE. F.

Several studies showed global methylation changes in ALS patients that could lead to altered expression levels. However, none of them focused on the in ï¬uence of promoter methylation on miRNA expression. Materials and Methods: We identi ï¬ed methylated regions in the genome of ALS patients through MeDIP sequencing (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing of precipitated DNA fragments). Results: Sequenced fragments were mapped to a total of 1321 miRNA promoters. Based on the methylation differ ences between samples we selected 358 of them for furtherassessment. Using KEGG analysis it turned out that miR NAs with altered methylation status in promoter region target numerous genes including those involved in ErbBsignalling pathway (p ,1*10 8), Hippo signalling pathway (p,2*10 8), prion diseases (p ,9*10 6), long term depres sion (p ,9*10 6), endocytosis (p ,2*10 5), adherens junc tions (p ,3*10 5), and axon guidance (p ,4*10 5). Conclusions: Promoter methylation of miRNA genes could be an important factor for their aberrant expression inALS. Since miRNA target genes are involved in diverse biochemical pathways and processes, aberrant expression of miRNAs may contribute to ALS pathology. However, fur ther validation studies are needed to con ï¬rm this.

The frequency of mutations in ALS patients has been extensively investigated in populations of various ethnic origins. Patients andmethods: All investigated ALS patients (n ,107) were of Hungarian origin. Repeat sizing of C9orf72 and ATXN2 genes and targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) wereused to comprehensively assess genetic variation in 35 major ALS genes. The cohort was previously screened for SOD1 andTARDBP genes, with negative results. Variants from whole exome sequencing data of other studies (200 individuals of Hungarian or Austrian origin) were used as in house control database. Results: Pathogenic repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene were detected in 10 patients (9.3%); intermediate polyQ lengths (27 33) in the ATXN2 gene were identi ï¬ed in 9 (8.4%) patients. Using panel sequencing, 31 rare, poten tially pathogenic variants were detected in 16 genes. According to the NGS results, the most frequently mutatedgenes were NEK1 (5.6%), NEFH ,SQSTM1 (3.7%), KIF5A, SPG11 (2.8%), ALS2, CCNF, FUS, MATR3, TBK1 and UBQLN2 (1.9%). Furthermore, potentially pathogenic var iants were found in ERBB4, FIG4, GRN and SIGMAR1 genes in single patients. Conclusion: Combining targeted NGS and repeat sizing, potentially causative variants were detected in 41% of patients including patients with variants considered to be of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS). Our ï¬ndings highlight the necessity for large scale multi center studies on ALS patients to better understand the underlying genetic causes.

Due tolower motor neuron loss caused by homozygous deletions in the survival of motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene patients suffer from progressive muscular atrophy and paralysis. Whereas SMA 1 and 2 patients never walk independently, SMA 3 patients present with a milder phenotype and later onset mainly attributable to higher copy numbers of theonly partially functional SMN2 gene. In 2017 the intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) Nusinersen has been approved as ï¬rst treatment for all types of SMA by the EU, based on results from phase 3 trials in pediatric patients. Nusinersen alters the splicing of SMN2 pre mRNA in order to increase production of full lengthSMN protein. Long term evaluation of treatment effects and impact of SMN2 carrier status in adult SMA patients under ASO therapy is urgently needed. Materials and Methods: In our center, 24 patients aged 18 65 years have been treated with intrathecal loading doses of Nusinersen at day 1, 14, 28 and 63, followed by main tenance doses every 4 months so far. Treatment ef ï¬cacy was assessed by monitoring of muscular functions and patient reported outcome measures in correlation to theSMN2 carrier status. Results: Intrathecal administration either by conventional or computed tomography (CT) guided lumbar puncture waswell tolerated. No patient has developed communicating hydrocephalus.

Materials and Methods: An eight year old girl born from a non consanguineous couple, presented a progressive motor sensory axonal polyneuropathy and subsequentlydeveloped cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia and cognitive decline. She underwent SMN1 deletion testing, NMD gene panel analysis and a trio WES. Results: WES led to the identi ï¬cation of a de novo c.1535C>T variant (p. Pro512Leu) in the CAPRIN1 (Cell Cycle Associated Protein 1) gene. This variant is not presentin 1000G and gnomAD. CAPRIN1 has reduced tolerance to missense (Z ,1.79) and is intolerant to nonsense variants (pLI,1.0). CAPRIN1 is abundant in the adult brain, where it regulates the transport and translation of mRNAs of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. Moreover, it contains an LC/ ID domain and it is a component of stress granules. Mutations in proteins containing LC/ID domains (TDP43, TIA1, hnRNPA1/2) cause MNDs and increase the like lihood of protein aggregates formation. Several in silico tools predict that the p. P512L mutation to increase the aggregation propensity. Indeed, experiments in HEK293T cells show that CAPRIN1 P512Lforms bulky aggregates as compared to CAPRIN1WT. Moreover, an insoluble protein extraction assay demonstrates that CAPRIN1WTelutes in the RIPA soluble fraction while CAPRIN1P512Lin the urea soluble one. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CAPRIN1P512Lis prone to aggregation. As CAPRIN1 de ï¬ciency is linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in human and mice, we propose CAPRIN1P512Las a novel gain of function NMD candidate gene. A. Delle Vedove: None. M.

Considerable phenotypic variation is known for both disorders, suggesting modi ï¬ers. We undertook a search for genetic modi ï¬ers of PMP22 related neuropathies by selecting the extremes of the spectrum of CMT1A and HNPP patients, based on disabilityassessed by the Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS). The ONLS data of 287 patients (184 CMT1A and 103 HNPP patients) showed a Gaussian distribution forboth disorders. The median score for CMT1A patients was 4 and for HNPP patients 3. Twenty one mild CMT1A (ONLS <2), 26 severe CMT1A (ONLS >5), 25 mild HNPP(ONLS <2) and 25 severe HNPP patients (ONLS >4) were clinically evaluated to further characterize disease severity. A next generation sequencing gene panel containing 147genes related to neuropathies and hereditary motor syn dromes was tested in this selection of patients. Missense, frameshift, nonsense and intronic mutations possibly affecting splicing were selected. No signi ï¬cant difference was found in the mean number of variants (mutation burden) per patient between the mild and severegroups. Further selection of variants with an allele fre quency of â¤4% in a control population was done. A sig niï¬cant difference between the mild and the severe HNPP group was found. In several patients double trouble was found (another likely pathogenic mutation in a neuropathy related gene). Replication of these results in a larger cohortare needed. B. W. van Paassen: None.

30608,"of Biological and Environmental Sciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Introduction: The giant genes nebulin ( NEB) and titin (TTN) both harbour large expressed segmental duplication (SD) regions. Mutations in NEB cause nemaline myopathy (NM), and mutations in TTN cause myopathies and cardiomyopathy. Using custom, targeted ComparativeGenomic Hybridization arrays for NM and other neuro muscular disorders, we have shown that copy number variations (CNVs) in the NEB SD are potentially patho genic. We have also shown that the TTN SD harbours recurrent and potentially pathogenic CNVs. For validation, we have established custom Digital Droplet PCR (ddPCR)assays targeting the SD regions of NEB andTTN. Materials and Methods: We created custom assays for exons 4 and 8 of the NEB SD, and exon intron regions 1 2 and 7 8 of the TTN SD. The ddPCR method was validated using 70 controls previously run on our CGH arrays. Results: We show that CNVs in the TTN SD are recurrent and appear in 25 % of both healthy and affected individuals. The ddPCR method is sensitive, and reliably detects CNV in both NEB andTTN SDs. Conclusions: Our ddPCR assay for the SD regions of NEB and TTN allows for rapid, speci ï¬c and inexpensive assessment of CNVs within these regions. Currently, we areinvestigating the potential pathogenicity of TTN SD region CNVs. Funding: This study is supported by Muscular Dystrophy UK L. J. Sagath: None. V. Lehtokari: None. C.

The new drug NS 065/NCNP 01 utilizingexon skipping therapy targeting speci ï¬c deletions has been used in a ï¬rst in human trial for the treatment of DMD. Wesurveyed 10 pairs of DMD participants and their parents within this clinical trial via an iPad survey form and through interviews regarding their understanding of the trial, expectations, anxieties, and reasons for participating in the trial. Approximately half of the participants actively decided to participate of their own volition, and none consideredquitting the trial. This indicates that participants participated more positively in this clinical trial than previously expected. However, some potential concerns were alsorevealed, with one being that the desire to please those around them might be more important to the DMD participants than the effects of the drug. Another issue is the possibility of biased information originating from the study subjects âparents; while seven out of 10 of the parents told their children that the study drug might work, only fourof these parents also explained that it might not work. Only two study participants received an explanation concerning the drug âs side effects from their parents. This result implies that caution should be taken when family expectations are high, and there is a possibility that subjects will be given biased information from their parents.

Isolated focal dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after Parkinson âs disease and essential tremor. The etiology is genetic in some cases, but over 75% are idiopathic. Materials and Methods: In the ï¬rst stage of our study, we analyzed onto the Ion Torrent PGM platform a well described homogenous group of 120 Romanian dystonia cases using our own designed Targeted SequencingAmpliSeq panel of 30 genes previously found to be asso ciated with dystonia (DYT) and other movement disorders. All samples had 97.85% average of target regions withcoverage by at least 30 folds. Data were analyzed using a bioinformatics in house pipeline based on GATK, Picard and Annovar software for reading alignments, variant call ing,ï¬ltering and annotation. Results: Molecular genetic screening identi ï¬ed mutations in 46/120 (38%) of the clinically diagnosed adult onsetisolated focal dystonia subjects. All identi ï¬ed mutations were previously reported to be associated with DYTs. Conclusions: The subsequent analysis of negative known DYTs patients for the genes in the customized panel using the Whole Exome Sequencing could offer the opportunity to assess extensively the genomic pro ï¬les of adult onset idiopathic isolated focal dystonia and could result in iden tiï¬cation of new genes and variants causing disease.

Not only have they began to unravel a greater level of cellular heterogeneity than previously could have been appreciated, it also enables the identi ï¬cation of sporadic cellular aberrations involved in disease etiology and development. One prime example of disease associated cellular het erogeneity is found in facioscapulohumeral muscular dys trophy (FSHD), which is characterized by sporadic de repression of the cleavage stage transcription factor DUX4in ~1:200 myonuclei. Yet, with the sporadic nature of DUX4 de repression limiting the resolution of bulk RNA seq analyses, essential insights in the cascade of eventsleading to apoptosis and severe muscle wasting observed in patients are currently limited. We used single cell RNA sequencing combined with pseudotime trajectory modeling to generate a detailed FSHD cellular progression model. We show that our model detects FSHD associated cellular progression in approx. 1%of all cells, and faithfully re ï¬ects both the burst like DUX4 expression as well as the downstream activation of various pathways previously implicated in FSHD. In addition, usingour model we were now able to identify new expression signatures that are likely related to both direct and indirect effects of DUX4. Our data therefore highlights the potential for single cell transcriptomics in studying disease etiology in genetic dis eases, even when hallmarked by high cellular heterogeneityas in FSHD, and shows that pseudotime trajectories like our FSHD pseudotime model may contain valuable information for further unraveling the role of cellular heterogeneity in disease etiology and progression.

In a patient with congenital muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, two heterozygous variants in the FKTN gene were identi ï¬ed: previously described pathogenic variant NM_001079802.1(FKTN_v001): c.509C>A p.(Ala170Glu) and a previously undescribed intronic variant of uncertain signi ï¬cance NG_008754.1 (FKTN_v001): c.911 13A>G, inherited from the mother. Materials and Methods: In order to study the effect of c.911 13A>G on FKTN splicing and con ï¬rm its patho genicity, we performed RT PCR of total RNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and ï¬broblasts obtained from the proband, his mother and healthy donors, as well asusing a FKTN minigene expression system in a HEK293T cell model line. Results: When studying the obtained mRNA structure, three FKTN isoforms were identi ï¬ed: two normal (present in control samples of healthy donors) and one aberrant with exon 9 skipping. The minigene expression analysis con ï¬rmed this data. The short isoform can be explained by the destruction of the intron 8 acceptor splice site. Thus, the work showed that the presence of a deep intronic variantc.911 13A>G in the FKTN gene leads to the loss of 133 nucleotides, with an open reading frame shifting and a 145 amino acid shortening (p. W301Rfs*13) of the protein. Conclusions: Functional analysis of intron variants allows to establish the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain clinical signi ï¬cance and con ï¬rm the diagnosis in patients. In this study, the pathogenicity of the c.911 13A>G variant in the FKTN gene was demonstrated. V. Freire: None. A. Filatova: None. I. Akimova: None. M. Bulakh: None. M. Skoblov: None.",2019

The size of D4Z4 repeats and its highsimilarity with the D4Z4 locus on chromosome 10q26makes diagnostic of FSHD complicated for basic diagnostic laboratories. Materials and Methods: Blood derived DNA was iso lated from 55 FSHD patients and its relatives. For the molecular genetic diagnostic, we used three methods: Southern blotting, molecular combing and a newly devel oped PCR based method. Results: Totally 55 individuals were analyzed by the Southern blotting, among them 12 parents/children,28 sporadic cases. Six patients with dif ï¬cult interpretation of the Southern blotting results were further analyzed by molecular combing. For all cases we determined the D4Z4repeat size and haplotype. The PCR based diagnostic was applied to 7 FSHD patients with one 4qA repeat below 10 units and to 8 healthy relatives with normal sized D4Z4repeats. The PCR results were concordant with the Southern blotting in 57.1% for the patients and in 88% for the healthy relatives. We suggest that the discordant results wereobtained due to high background of ampli ï¬cation or to DNA quality issues. Conclusions: The Southern blot and the molecular combing results are highly correlated. The PCR based method shows potential to diagnose FSHD; however needs further optimization. Improvement of the PCR basedmethod may simplify FSHD diagnostic for basic diag nostic laboratories. Acknowledgments: We are grateful to Genomic Vision Company for the ability to test DNA samples. M.

The cardinal clinicalfeatures of the disease were slow progression, muscular weakness with dominancy in the proximal portion of the lower limbs and in the distal portion of the upper limbs,sensory involvement with dominancy in the lower limbs (glove and stocking type), are ï¬exia, ï¬ne postural and action tremors, painful muscle cramps, elevated serum creatinekinase levels, urinary disfunction, and recurrent paroxysmal dry cough. Sural nerve biopsy showed moderate, chronic, mainly axonal neuropathy. To identify the causativenucleotide variant for the disease, we studied the Japanese pedigree with the disease of 19 family members including nine patients in ï¬ve generations. By the linkage analysis, we mapped the disease locus to 1p13.3 q23 (maximum logarithm of odds score ,2.24). The whole exome sequen cing upon ï¬ve patients and one healthy relative from the pedigree revealed 2,526 patient speci ï¬c single nucleotide variants (SNVs). By the ï¬ltering processes using the public SNP databases, our linkage analysis, validation by Sangersequencing, con ï¬rming cosegregation, genotyping 520 healthy Japanese individuals, and functional predictions, we identi ï¬ed one SNV located in IQGAP3 which is known to be associated with neurite outgrowth. Immunohistochem istry show increased expression of IQGAP3 in lymphocytes and sural nerves of a patient compared to those of a control. We conclude that IQGAP3 is a causative gene for the disease.

The mode of inheritance in HSP can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X linked, or mitochondrial. There is signi ï¬cant genetic heterogeneity in HSP, with at least 65 genes and 80 loci identi ï¬ed thus far. Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been used for genediscovery in HSP since 2011, resulting in a marked increase in the rate of novel disease causing genes being identi ï¬ed. Despite the use of WES, genetic analysis has failed inï¬nding of causative genes in ~45% 60% in the autosomal dominant HSP (AD HSP) and ~71% 80% in the autosomal recessive HSP (AR HSP) groups, indicating that, themajority of HSP genes especially AR HSPs have remained unknown. Materials and Methods: In order to identi ï¬cation of novel HSP disease causing genes, we investigated the causes of AR HSP in 12 unrelated Iranian families using WES. Results: This approach led us to identify the mutations in seven known disease causing genes including SPG7 (two cases) , CAPN1, CYP7B1, ENTPD1, GJC2, ERLIN2 , and SPG11 (two cases) and three novel candidate HSP genes. Functional analyses to evaluate of the biological implication of the novel genes are ongoing. Conclusions: Here, we could ï¬nd nine variations in seven known HSP causing genes in 12 cases (75%) and three novel HSP genes in the remaining ones using WESmethod.

In girls, carrier status of Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) should be taken into consideration so that the diagnostic process might include both technical and ethical aspects. Therefore, no diagnostic system has been established and the clinical background is still unclear. This study aimed to investigatethe clinical background of hyper creatine kinase emia girls. Fifteen girls, who were referred to our hospital between April 2014 and August 2018 with persistent elevatedplasma CK without a family history of muscular disease, were included. Age and Value of CK at the ï¬rst visit were 0 12 years old and 740 21,944 IU/L. Eight cases exhibitedclinical symptoms (symptomatic group), while seven cases showed no symptoms (asymptomatic group). Genetic muscular disease was diagnosed using muscle biopsy orgenetic analysis. In the symptomatic group, diagnoses were DMD/BMD carrier (3 cases), Fukuyama congenital mus cular dystrophy (1 case), sarcoglycanopathy (1 case),dermatomyositis (1 case), and undiagnosed (2 cases). One girl presenting with marked elevated CK and developmental delay was diagnosed with balanced translocation with thebreakpoint located within the DMD gene and skewing of X chromosome inactivation. Diagnoses in the asymptomatic group were DMD/BMD carrier (3 cases), calpainopathy(1case), and undiagnosed (3cases). Both groups included patients affected by muscular disease and DMD/BMD carriers, suggesting that both conditions should be con sidered regardless of presence of symptoms.

However, thephenotypic consequences of MORC2 in patients and its role in neuronal biology remain to be clari ï¬ed. Materials and Methods: A gene capture panel was performed to screen undiagnosed patients with CMT. To determine the effect of the most common MORC2 muta tions in a neural context, p. S87L and p.

30618,"Introduction: Sarcoglycanopathies (SGCs, LGMD2C F) are a subgroup of autosomal recessive limb girdle musculardystrophies (LGMD), caused by mutations in four sarco glycan genes ( SGCG, SGCA, SGCB, SGCD ). These forms are characterized by childhood onset and rapidly progres sive course with loss of ability to walk during a second decade of progression. In general, SGCs could hardly be distinguished from Duchenne/Becker myopathy and otherpseudohypertrophic LGMDs due to quite similar clinical symptoms. Materials and Methods: Targeted massive parallel sequencing was performed in 290 Russian patients with progressive muscle weakness using a custom gene panel covering four sarcoglycan genes. Results: Genetic analysis revealed homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in 16 patients in 3 of 4 sarcoglycan genes. The SGCA mutations have been detected in 13 cases (4,5%); the SGCB andSGCG muta tions have been found in 2 (0,7%) and 1 (0,3%) cases respectively. Mutation spectrum of SGCA gene was repre sented by 12 different mutations, 4 of them are recurrent. Previously we also identi ï¬ed 4 patients with SGCA muta tions in a Duchenne/Becker myopathy cohort. As the result,two pathogenic SGCA variants c.229C>T (p. Arg77Cys) and c.271G>A (p. Gly91Ser) were de ï¬ned as the most common SGCA mutations in Russian patients accounting 29,4% and 26,5% of all mutant alleles respectively. Conclusions: This study revealed that LGMD2D is the most common form of SGCs in Russian LGMD cohort. Tosum up, SGCs account 5,5% of all LGMDs in total that make them the third LGMD subgroup following LGMD2A and LGMD2I. However, in contrast to other Europeanpopulations, SGCs are very uncommon in Russia. M. V. Bulakh: None. O. P. Ryzhkova: None. A. V. Polyakov: None.",2019

LGMD2A is an autosomal recessive disorder highlighted by weakness of the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscles. Recently, CAPN3 heterozygous mutations have been known to cause dominant LGMD type4(LGMDD4). Materials and Methods: We investigated a large cohort of 192 Iranian patients with different grades of musculardystrophy who referred to Kariminejad Najmabadi Pathol ogy and Genetics Center during 2012 2018 by exome and targeted next generation sequencing. Results: Twenty nine LGMD2A cases were identi ï¬ed, carrying 22 different CAPN3 gene variants. Approximately 15% of participants possessed variations in CAPN3 gene; including 10 missense, 5 frameshift, 1 inframe, 2 nonsense and 4 splice site changes; in which 9 variants were novel compromises p. Gly127Glu, p. Ile266_Asp267del, p. Ser265Pro, p. Gly221Cys, p. Ser432*, p. Tyr507Cys, p. Gln545Serfs*50, c.1115 +1dup and c.1353A>G at splice donor site. Moreover, 4 variants occurred multiple times inthe cohort (p. Ile266_Asp267del, p. Ser432*, p. Arg748Gln and c.1115 +1dup). In 3 patients, the second causative variant has not been found which suggests diagnosing ofLGMDD4. Conclusions: Based on ï¬ndings, it seems that prevalence of LGMD2A is high in Iranian LGMD patients and somemutations are more frequent. Besides, most of the variants have been occurred in Domain III and the catalytic domain (domain II) of the calpain3 protein involved in Ca2+ induced activation of the protein.

Both genetic defects andenvironmental toxic factors leading to abnormal brainstem development are proposed to be involved in the aetiology of MBS. Recently, mutations in PLXND1 and REV3L were conï¬rmed to cause MBS. Here, we applied next generation mate pair sequencing to map the breakpoints of a complex chromosomal rearrangement (CCR) 46,XY,t(7;8;11;13) in apreviously reported patient with MBS, and con ï¬rmed 39 out of 41 breakpoint junctions by Sanger sequencing. Molecular mapping revealed 41 clustered breakpoints,involving chromosomes 7, 8, 11 and 13, resulting in heavy intra and interchromosomal rearrangements with typical hallmarks of chromothripsis. Among 12 truncated protein coding genes, SEMA3A and SEMA3D are attractive candidates for the MBS features, as they encode class 3 semaphorins, where SEMA3A is known to bind to theMBS associated PLXND1. Intriguingly, the CCR also truncated PIK3CG , which in silico interacts with a protein encoded by the other known MBS gene REV3L , and with the SEMA3A/PLXND1 complex via the vascular endothe lial growth factor FLT1. In conclusion, the simultaneous truncation of several interactors of the known MBS genesby a single CCR suggests that the multiple breakpoints in germline chromothripsis may predispose to complex multi genic disorders.

We reporta novel genetic cause of a cardiomyopathy mimicking HCM in two consanguineous families with a high incidence of sudden cardiac arrest. The age at onset in the patients was inadolescence or in young adulthood. Material and Methods: Investigations included clinical examination, endomyocardial and skeletal muscle biopsyand genetic analyses by exome sequencing and homo zygosity mapping. Functional studies were performed in zebra ï¬sh by expression analysis and genetic down regulation using antisense morpholino oligomers. Results: Endomyocardial biopsy and skeletal muscle biopsy of individuals from both families demonstratedcharacteristic alterations including muscle ï¬bers with a âcogwheel âappearance, and desmin accumulation.

We want to present that using a standard TP PCR method it is possibleto skip expansion of CTG triplets due to interruptions present in the CTG repeat sequences. Materials and Methods: Patient female (40 years old) symptoms of dystrophia appeared at the age of 30: problems with walking, balance disorders and weakness in the limbs. A test for dynamic mutation in the DMPK gene was per formed. Standard TP PCR method didn't show expansion of CTG repeat sequence. We used a bidirectionally labeledTP PCR method (Radvansky et al.) in which ampli ï¬cation products are anchored at the 3 âend of a CTG repeat expansion rather than the 5 âend. The effect of this redesign is that it may prevent the failure in detecting expansion positive patients carrying repeat interruptions. Results: TP PCR reverse primer combinations showed expansion above 50 repeats at the 3'end of the CTG repeat sequence. Conclusions: Thanks to the combination of both: forward and reverse TP PCR primers there is a simple and effective method of identifying the presence or absence of expanded CTG repeat alleles in the DMPK gene. It seems necessary touse forward and reverse TP PCR primers, due to the pos sibility of occurrence of interruptions observed at both ends of the CTG repeat sequence. A. Bialek Proscinska: None. J.

Recently introduced antisense oligonucleotidetreatment improves outcome, in particular when applied presymptomatically. The genetic cause of SMA is in >95% of cases a homozygous deletion of the survival motorneuron (SMN1) 1 gene, which makes low cost detection of SMA cases as part of newborn screening programs feasible. We developed and validated a new SALSA MC002 meltingcurve assay that meets Dutch legal requirements of not detecting asymptomatic carriers and that detects the absence of the SMN1 exon 7 DNA sequence using crude extractsfrom dried blood spot (DBS) newborn screening cards. Melting curve analysis shows speci ï¬c peaks of both the SMN1 and the disease modifying SMN2 homolog, and incase of insuf ï¬cient amounts of sample DNA, a warning peak. We retrieved 47 DBS samples from children with1482genetically con ï¬rmed SMA (identi ï¬ed by using the Dutch SMA database) after consent from parents and 375 controls from the national archive of the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

Concordance with the second tier âgolden standard âP021 SMA MLPA test was 100%.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches represent a powerful tool to identify genetic variants in CMT in contrast to classic time consuming geneby gene approach. However, approximately 50% of patients remain undiagnosed after use of NGS tools. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular diagnosis in a group ofpatients with CMT using targeted NGS. 38 patients presenting with hereditary neuropathies were tested by targeted NGS for 150 nuclear genes associated with CMTand related neuropathies. In 15 of the 38 patients, we identi ï¬ed the de ï¬nite molecular diagnosis (39.47%). Intotal, 6 novel and 8 known pathogenic variants in 12 genes were identi ï¬ed. Autosomal recessive axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia was the most prevalent type in our cohort (4 patients). Additionally, autosomal recessive inheritance was con ï¬ rmed in patients harbouring GDAP1 andFIG4 variants. Our targeted gene panel allowed us to perform a very rapid and cost effective screening of genes associated with CMT. We expanded a spectrum of genotypes of CMT and clinical phenotypes of knownCMT related genes. This diagnostic rate was achieved by performing accurate neurologic examination prior to enrolment patients in the study and interpreting theNGS data. B. Burnyte: None. K. Grigalioniene: None. A.

Due to strongly overlapping pheno types of neuromuscular disorders, the differential diagnosis of non 5q SMAs is challenging. Materials and Methods: For the last 23 years, we have performed SMN1 deletion analysis to 3,535 individuals withAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1483suspected SMA. In 1,715 (48.5%) of these individuals, no SMN1 deletion/mutation was detected. Review of the clin ical data with respect to a possible motor neuron disorder led to 114 patients who were available and consented to participate. These 114 patients were analysed by two dif ferent gene panels. Of these, 24 unresolved patients and 49new patients were analysed by WES or/and WGS. Results: Gene panel provided a diagnosis in 39% (44/ 114) of the probands. The neuromuscular disease panel with479 genes outperformed the lower motor neuron disease panel with 62 genes with a 44% to 13% diagnostic yield, respectively. WES/WGS revealed the disease causingmutation in 38% (28/73) of these patients. Within the NeurOmics project, we published ï¬ve novel disease causing genes ( BICD2, CHP1, PIEZO2, VAMP1, ADPRHL2) and introduced three novel genes ( PRUNE1, MCM3AP, AGTPBP1) with recently published overlapping phenotypes. Discussion: NGS is a powerful method for diagnostic and gene identi ï¬cation purposes in non 5q SMA, and illustrate the wide spectrum of neuromuscular disorders that initiallypresent as motor neuron disease. Gene panels with larger gene representation perform best in clinical conditions with heterogenic genetic background. For phenotypes that arenot ful ï¬lling the core clinical criteria for motor neuron disorders, a more comprehensive WES or WGS methods should be used. M. Karakaya: None. M. Storbeck: None. E.

SMCHD1 loss of function mutations can hamper its function, leading to the aberrant expression of D4Z4 genes associated with FSHD. This study aimed to characterize agroup of patients with a clinical suspect of FSHD, by molecular analysis of SMCHD1 sequence. Materials and Methods: 58 patients with a clinical suspect of FSHD were enrolled and were analyzed by NGS methodology and direct sequencing. The detected variants were investigated by bioinformatics tools in order to predicttheir impact on the protein and evaluate the potential pathogenic effect on FSHD. Results: Molecular analysis of SMCHD1 sequence revealed the presence of exonic, intronic and 3 âUTR var iants. Among them, ï¬ve novel variants (c.183_184insGT; c.1131+2delTAAG; c.2130insC; c.3469G>T; c.5150_5151delAA) were predicted to be pathogenic for FSHD, causing a substantial alteration of protein structure and function. In addition, four variants (c.7394A>C;c.7597G>A; c.*1397A>G; c.*1889G>C) in 3 âUTR were predicted to affect the binding of different miRNAs. Conclusions: Molecular analysis of SMCHD1 allowed to detect novel potential pathogenic variants in patients with a clinical suspect of FSHD. In particular, those variants may modify the structure and function of SMCHD1 protein,leading thereby to the disruption of its physiological activity and, ultimately, contributing to FSHD etiopathogenesis.

NoAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1485information on the presence of these truncated gene copies in other populations has been reported. Methods: A new version of the SALSA MLPA P021 SMA probemix was tested on 1255 samples from the 1000 genomes / HapMap projects from 15 different populations. The probemix covers all SMN1 andSMN2 exons by at least one probe and contains four SMN1 orSMN2 speciï¬c probes. Results: Large differences in the frequency of a truncated SMN gene were observed between all the different popu lations tested, ranging from 0 to 20%. Frequencies in the different populations were as follows: 8 20% in Europeanpopulations, 7 11% in American populations, and 0 1% in both the Asian and African populations.

Mutations inSPAST , encoding Spastin, are the most frequent cause of HSP. Recently, through the analysis of 842 SPAST mutated patients, we showed that mutation nature accounts for some of the age at onset variability and that sex in ï¬uences the disorder penetrance. To identify additional age at onset modiï¬ers, a GWAS analysis was performed on 134 SPAST truncating mutations carriers. Materials and Methods: Patients were genotyped using Illumina In ï¬niumOmni2.5Exome 8 kit. Single variant test was performed using a logistic mixed model for binary traits available with GMMAT R package, adjusted for sex and patients ârelatedness. Patients with very discordant age at onset were compared ( â¤15 years versus â¥45 years). Results: A group of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (r 2>0.8) reached a p value suggestive for association (top p value,10e 6). The 7 suggestive SNPs are located on chromosome 19, in the 3 âUTR region of SARS2 gene and are described as eQTLs of this gene in the GTEx database. Among the genotyped patients, a signi ï¬cantly lower age at onset (p<0.0001, Mann Whitney test) was associated with the minor allele at all SNPs, as well as a tendency to adecreased disorder severity. Conclusions: Pathogenic mutations affecting SARS2 , encoding a mitochondrial seryl tRNA synthetase, havealready been linked to progressive spastic paraparesis onset, suggesting it as a good candidate. iPSCs derived neurons andDrosophila model are being used to further con ï¬rm its role as SPAST HSP age of onset modi ï¬er.

The antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen was recently approved in Sweden for treatment of SMA in the public health caresystem. In this study we compare the development in motor function in patients who received treatment within three1486months of symptom onset for SMA type 1, and within twelve months for SMA type 2, to the patients receiving treatment later in the course of disease. Materials and Methods: All patients diagnosed with SMA type 1 or 2 treated with nusinersen for at least twelve months at the Department of Pediatrics, Queen SilviaChildren's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden are included in the study. The motor function is assessed by standardized motor function scales; CHOP INTEND/HFMSE, developedand validated for SMA patients. Results: Data regarding age of onset, age at start of treatment, genetic constitution and development of motorfunction will be presented. Conclusion: Previous studies have indicated that treat ment ef ï¬cacy for motor function is greater in patients receiving treatment close to onset of symptoms or even in presymptomatic patients compared to patients receiving the treatment later in the course of disease.

The level of methylation of SMN2 gene as well as genes playing role in neural cells ( OLIG2 ,ISL1,SLC23A2 ,DYNC1H1 ) and pluripotency regulating genes ( Oct4 ,SALL4 ) has been determined by means of methylation sensitive high resolu tion melting. Signi ï¬cant differences have been found in the methylation level of the regulatory regions of OCT4 ,SALL4 andSMN genes between patients with SMA type I, type II and a healthy individual. A decrease in methylation level ofthe promoter region of OLIG2 gene in SMA type I compared to SMA type II, as well as of 41 exons of the DYNC1H1 gene in SMA type I compared to a healthy individual was also found. The results observed in this study may elucidate new pathways involved in SMA progression and may contribute to better understanding ofthe particularities of disease pathogenesis.

SMA is highly heteroge neous with various genes with different heritable patterns causing the disease. In the typical form, patients havedefective SMN1 genes. To date, tens of genes have been identi ï¬ed for Atypical SMA. In this study, 144 familiesAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1487suspected for SMA were included. Patients were ï¬rst examined for typical SMA by MLPA and assessment of STR markers for SMN1 . Next, patients who did not have mutations in the SMN1 gene were examined using STR markers for the DNAJB2 ,IGHMBP2 ,SIGMAR1 and PLEKHG5 genes. Subsequently, autozygosity mapping followed by sequencing were performed for cases with homozygous haplotypes. Finally, Whole Exome sequencing (WES) was done for the remaining cases who did not showassociation with any of the studied genes. The pathogenicity of the newly identi ï¬ed mutations was examined using various softwares and ACMG guideline. SMN1 deletions/ mutations were identi ï¬ed in 134 families. Of the remaining 10 families, three families showed mutations in DNAJB2 , SIGMAR1 andPLEKHG5 genes. In six families tested by WES, four families had pathogenic variants in TNNT1 , TPM3 andTTN genes respectively. MLPA and assessment of STR markers can be helpful in both typical and atypicalSMA cases. Moreover, linkage analysis and WES are suggested as effective strategies for identi ï¬cation of mutations in patients with atypical SMA. M. Taheri: None. A. Sayad: None.",2019
30634,"Blueprint Genetics, Helsinki, FinlandIntroduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive degen eration of spinal cord motor neurons. In most cases, the disease is caused by the homozygous absence of the SMN1 gene. Copy number of the highly homologous SMN2 gene can also modify the disease severity. To address the clinical importance of accurate SMN1 and SMN2 copy number analysis, we developed a custom bioinformatic analysisbased on next generation sequencing (NGS) data combined with a novel RNase H2 dependent PCR (rhPCR) for conï¬rmation analysis. Materials and Methods: The bioinformatic method uti lizes sequence reads at four loci differing between the genes. The rhPCR assays target two of the loci with RNA modiï¬ed primers that require activation by RNase H2 enzyme improving assay speci ï¬city and sensitivity com pared to standard methods. We validated the methods using27 reference samples with known SMN1 /SMN2 copynumbers and evaluated the clinical performance by ana lyzing 89 patient samples. Results: Both methods showed 100% sensitivity and speciï¬city to detect SMN1 copy numbers 0 2 or higher and SMN2 copy numbers 0 3 or higher. In clinical samples, the obtained SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers showed 100% concordance between the methods. Additionally, we applied the bioinformatic analysis to 2196 de identi ï¬ed patient samples not referred for the indication of SMA. Heterozygous SMN1 deletions were observed in 2.6% of the samples, which agrees with previously reported frequencies. Conclusions: We established an accurate and high throughput approach to test for SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers enabling diagnostics of SMA and application of novel therapeutic strategies. H. Junnila: A.

SMA is commonly caused by homozygous exon 7 deletions in the survival motor neuron 1 gene ( SMN1 ). The severity of SMA is modulated by the copy number of the paralogous SMN2 gene. Here, we report the two site evaluation of a single tube assay that quanti ï¬esSMN1 andSMN2 copy number. Materials and Methods: A prototype SMN1/2 single tube PCR was developed from AmplideX Â®PCR/CE SMN1 reagents (Asuragen). Amplicons generated from whole blood genomic DNA were resolved by capillary electro phoresis (CE) on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ï¬c). Gene copy numbers were calculated from peak area ratios that were normalized to a plate calibrator andbinned as 0, 1, 2, 3, or â¥4 copies. Two laboratories (one in Portugal and one in the US) evaluated 60 residual clinical samples with reference genotypes. Results: Normalized SMN1 and SMN2 copy numbers demonstrated operator to operator and site to site agree ment (R 2>0.98). Binned copy number calls for SMN1 spanned 0 to â¥4 copies and were concordant with reference results for both laboratories. SMN2 copy numbers ranged from 0 to â¥4 copies and were concordant for 59/60 (98.3%) samples. Conclusions: A simple, high throughput SMN1/2 PCR/ CE assay was successfully evaluated using 60 samples,including 15 SMA and 13 carrier samples. This method offers a simple work ï¬ow and fast turnaround time (< 4hrs from sample to answer) with potential as an accurate andreliable alternative to existing methods. M. E. Oliveira: None. S.

Long repeats alleles in ATXN 1, ATXN 2, and NIPA1 genes are associated to ALS susceptibility. Tandem Repeat Polymorphisms (TRPs) are good candi dates for missing hereditability in ALS (40%), although they were never systematically analyzed as they represent aremarkable challenge to NGS. The aim of this study is to perform a systematic analysis of TRPs in ALS by combining NGS and novel bioinformatics tools. Weperformed our analysis from whole genome sequencing data (WGS) of 70 ALS cases. TRPs were evaluated by means of a software developed within our consortium todetect tandem repeat expansion. Validation of expanded loci was conducted by Repeat primer PCR We identi ï¬ed an ALS patient with a CGG expansion in 5 âUTR of FRA10AC1 gene. To explore the possible role of this CGG expansion in ALS we screened a cohort of 337 ALS and 285 controls and we found 3 expanded patients (0.9%)and no control. We failed to replicated this result in a second cohort of 426 ALS patients and 733 controls (1 ALS (0.2%) and 5 controls (0.7%)) Overall, we observed theCGG expansion in 4/763 (0.5%) ALS patients and 5/1018 controls (0.5%). FRA10AC1 gene expression was not silenced by the expansion. The software we developed candetect repeat expansions from WGS data, although FRA10AC1 CGG expansion seems not to be involved in ALS pathogenesis.

Clinical symp toms often distinguish SCAs from HSPs; however, complex forms combine these and other neurological symptoms, in a wide phenotypic diversity (age at onset, severity andprogression rate). In this study, we provide an estimate of the diagnostic yield of SCAs and HSPs at our laboratory. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and appliedvirtual gene panels on 333 patients with SCAs and HSPs, and analysed SNVs, using an in house pipeline, and CNVs, using Golden Helix âs VarSeq software. We tested 161 SCA patients using a WES based virtual panel (145 genes), where we achieved a molecular diagnosis for 17 patients (18 previously described and 13 novel disease causingvariants); in another 72 patients, we reported a VUS, according to the ACMG classi ï¬cation. In 172 patients with HSP (118 genes in the virtual panel), we established amolecular diagnosis in 27 cases (35 described and 8 novel disease causing variants), while in 50 probands we reported a VUS. We obtained a diagnostic yield of 10.6% for SCAsand 15.7% for HSPs; VUS reported represented 44.7% of SCA and 29.1% of HSP cases. In undiagnosed patients, family studies, correlation with phenotype, CNV analysis inaddition to ï¬exible virtual gene panels (e.g., including newly discovered genes or using a large neurological disorder multigene panel) may increase the diagnostic yield,in order to provide a better disease management and improve genetic counselling for affected patients and their families.

The cytogenetic recognition of these structurally rearranged chromosomes can be dif ï¬cult to ascertain. In last years the application of array CGH in the investigation of patients with intellectual disability and congenital malfor mations increased substantially the detection of crypticchromosomal imbalances. However, the rearrangement underlying the imbalance could be missed, when we only perform molecular techniques. We report a 10 year old girl presenting intellectual dis ability, attention de ï¬cit hyperactivity disorder, short stature, prenatal microcephaly, aplasia cutis congenita, bulbousbiï¬d nose, bilateral congenital trigger thumb, shortening of the fourth metacarpal of the right hand, pectus excavatum, long ï¬rst toe, and mild hypertrichosis. High resolution cytogenetic analysis revealed a cryptic alteration: 46,XX,add(17)(p13.1). To characterize the imbalance 180K oligonucleotide array CGH was per formed, revealing a 2.4 Mb duplication: arr[hg19] 17q24.3q25.1(68,620,187 71,083,594)x3 encompassing 10 genes. Molecular cytogenetics showed an intrachromoso mal insertion on 17p. Parents were not available to study. The most relevant gene involved in the imbalance is SOX9 (MIM*608160) and encodes a transcription factor essentialfor both sex and skeletal development. Duplications of noncoding elements 5 prime of SOX9 were associated with abnormal digit and nail development. Investigations arebeing addressed, by chromosome conformation capture (HiC) in patient cell lines in combination with whole genome sequencing, in order to do a better interpretation ofthe pathogenic mechanisms underlying the chromosomal rearrangement.

Most reported individuals have deletions, and only eleven patients with clinical ï¬ndings attributed to 19p13.3 duplications have been reported. Interestingly, 19p13.3 microdeletions are described in patients with syndromic intellectual disability and macro cephaly, and 19p13.3 microduplications in patients withsyndromic intellectual disability and microcephaly. More over, patients with 19p13.3 microduplication share common developmental features, suggesting the existence of a newmicroduplication syndrome. Methods: To characterize these new syndromes, we formed a French collaborative study, and included 37 newpatients with 19p13.3 rearrangements. We performed phe notype and genotype analysis, including genotype Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1491phenotype correlations by critical region delineation. We screened this critical region with experimental ï¬ndings in murine model by using the data mining software Manteia, to purpose candidate genes never associated with human phenotype before. Results: We report the largest cohort of patients with 19p13.3 rearrangements, and describe a new 377 Kb critical region associated with syndromic intellectual disability and micro/macrocephaly. 19p13.3 rearrangements are asso ciated with speci ï¬c recurrent clinical ï¬ndings: mild to moderate intellectual disability, pre and post natal growth delay, micro or macrocephaly, osteoarticular anomaliesincluding precocious osteoporosis in children, congenital severe hip dysplasia and scoliosis, congenital heart defect, genitourinary ï¬ndings and immunode ï¬ciency. Breakpoint analysis and supporting murine model allowed us to pur pose candidate genes associated with micro/macrocephaly.

Patients with atypical features should prompt consideration of coexisting diagnoses due to the possibility of additional genome âwide mutations/CNVs which may be inherited, as well as, mutations/CNVs on the other chromosome 22q11.2 allele resulting in an autosomal recessive condition. Both occurrences compound symptomsimpacting management and genetic counseling. Methods: Records on 1422 patients with laboratory conï¬rmed 22q11.2DS followed at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were reviewed to identify a dual diagnosis, including a subset with atypical features, e.g. craniosynos tosis, whose samples underwent NGS of the intact 22q11.2allele in Leuven/Warsaw. Results: 24 patients had a coexisting diagnosis (1.7% of our cohort) including 8 patients with conditions unrelated to22q11.2DS (SCID, Trisomy 8 mosaic, CHD7 mutation, cystic ï¬brosis, maternally inherited 17q12 deletion, G6PD deï¬ciency, von Willebrand disease, 1q21.1 deletion) and 16 patients with 22q11.2DS and a CNV/mutation on the remaining allele resulting in an autosomal recessive condi tion. The latter group included mutations/CNVs in GP1BB , CDC45 (4), LZTR1 (2), SNAP29 (4), and TANGO2 (5) explaining their atypical features, unfortunately including sudden death in a 5 year old child with post mortem iden tiï¬cation of TANGO2 Related Disease. Conclusions: These ï¬ndings support considering addi tional laboratory testing in this population to ensureappropriate personalized care, as formulating medical management decisions hinges on establishing the correct diagnoses in their entirety, especially given that theseï¬ndings are medically actionable, potentially altering long â term outcome and recurrence risk counseling.

There is still very poor understanding of how heterozygous microdeletion of approximately 50 genes can lead to such diverse expressivity of the clinical features inpatients carrying the same deletions. Two aspects seem to have an impact on phenotype variability; coexistence of the second condition and modi ï¬ers of typical clinical features. In this project we focused on three of the potential mechanisms underlying the ï¬rst aspect: pathogenic variants within the remaining 22q11.2 region, SNVs in genesoutside of the deletion and additional CNVs. For 85 22q11DS carriers deep phenotype was performed based on the form with over 230 clinical features. Subse quently for all patients whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out. Data was analysed using standard protocol, additionally two algorithms were implemented to identifyCNVs in genome (CoNIFER and HMZdel ï¬nder). WES analysis revealed: 9 pathogenic SNVs and 54 potentially pathogenic variants in known disease relatedgenes correlating with patients âphenotypes. Moreover we found 149 rare variants of unknown signi ï¬cance, including 2 in 22q11.2 region. All variants were classi ï¬ed as dele terious by at least 3 of 4 applied function prediction scores and located in genes with increased expression in brain, nervous system, immune system or heart.

Aim: To describe morbidity in a national 47,XYY cohort using complete registry data on hospital admissions andprescribed medication. Setting: A uniform public health care system. Participants: A total of 251 males with 47,XYY (n,205), 46,XY/47,XYY (n ,28) or compatible karyotypes (n ,18) diagnosed during 1965 2014 and a randomly selected age matched control cohort of 25,100 males fromthe general population. Results: Hospital admission owing to any diagnosis was signiï¬cantly increased among 47,XYY compared to con trols (HR ,1.8, CI: 1.6 2.4). Among a total of 18 diagnostic groups the risk of admission was increased in all but three groups. The highest HRs were observed for congenitalmalformations (HR ,6.1, CI: 4.8 7.6); psychiatric diseases (HR,5.7, CI: 4.5 7.1); endocrine and metabolic disorders (HR,3.2, CI: 2.4 4.4); neurologic diseases (HR ,3.0, CI: 2.2 4.0); and urogenital system disorders (HR ,3.0, CI: 2.4 3.7).

We have generated a Knock out (KO) model in HeLa cell line. We use the CRISPR/Cas9 method with dual system with Homology Direct Repair (HDR). After isolation of homozygous clones, we validated ALMS1 expression by qPCR and Sangersequencing of the recombinant amplicon comprised between Exon 1 and 3. Then we evaluate mitochondrial activity, proliferation and apoptosis resistance. We obtained a totalinhibition in the expression of the ALMS1 gene. We are performing the characterization but we expected apoptosis resistance, cell cycle elongation and inhibition of mitochon drial activity like other authors report in analysis of patientÂ´s ï¬broblasts. The generation of cellular models using CRIPR/ Cas9 for the AlstrÃ¶m syndrome is considered as a simple andeasy to implement tool that would broaden the knowledge of the molecular basis of this disease.

He presented polyuria, poly dipsia for 2 months and important weight loss. Hematicexam showed high glycemia, high value of HB1Ac and negative speci ï¬c insulin autoantibodies suspecting diabetic ketoacidosis. The insulin treatment improved symptoms andglicemia. The genetic evaluation revealed a more complex phenotype included hyposomia, growth delay, mild intel lectual disability, monosomy of left kidney, fusion ofcervical vertebrates, brachydactyly, Arnold Chiari syn drome and chronic lymphocytic leucemia. The WESanalysis con ï¬rmed the multiple aetiopatology of the clinical picture identifying mutations in different causative genes. The likely pathogenetic missense mutations in CAPN10 , SLC2A2 andGCKR explained only diabetes mellitus non insulin dependent. The kidney anomaly correlated to CHD1L mutation, candidate gene for congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). An essential in depth study of WES identi ï¬ed a new ANKRD11 mutation, responsible of KBG syndrome. This is a rare autosomaldominant condition characterized by short stature, neurolo gical involvement, skeletal anomalies and macrodontia. ANKRD11 encodes for a member of family of Ankyrin repeat domain containing cofactors that are inhibitors of ligand dependent transcriptional activation. Moreover, it is known as a tumor protein p53 interacting protein. ANKRD11 enhances TP53 dependent transcriptional acti vation promoting its tumor suppressive effects. Retrospec tively analysis of literature (about hundred cases)highlighted the presence of only two cases with malignancy, testicular rhabdoid tumor and acute myeloid leukemia. Although we cannot exclude that tumor observed in KBGpatients developed coincidentally, the role of ANKRD11 and our new case suggest a general cancer surveillance. R. Artuso: None. F. Peluso: None.

Genomicmatch making has accelerated the path from candidate gene identi ï¬cation to establishing causality. Using exome sequencing, we identi ï¬ed a de novo frameshift variant in thePRR12 gene in a 2 year old girl with anophthalmia and developmental delay. PRR12 is highly expressed in the brain and the visual system. It has a high missenseconstraint score (Z ,3.37) and no loss of function variants listed in Gnomad (pLI ,1.00). De novo truncating variants inPRR12 were recently reported in three individuals with developmental delay and iris abnormalities. Through GeneMatcher, we were connected to 11 additional patients from around the globe, bringing the total number ofindividuals with de novo variants in PRR12 to 15. There were no recurrent variants; all but one, were truncating; and none were listed in Gnomad. A variety of eye abnormalitieswere observed in 10/15 individuals; including myopia, stellate iris, coloboma, Rieger âs anomaly, microphthalmia, cryptophthalmos and anophthalmia. Developmental delaywas noted in 13/15 and microcephaly in 5/15. The overlapping clinical ï¬ndings, especially the ophthalmolo gical features, support an association between haploinsuf ï¬ ciency of PRR12 and a distinct neurodevelopmental disorder. Features are variable and functional data is needed to con ï¬rm pathogenicity. We plan to use zebra ï¬sh and mouse models to replicate the eye and growth phenotypes and further investigate the pathogenicity of different PRR12 variants.

Major clinical features include congenital cataracts, sensor ineural hearing loss, intellectual disability, seizures, reduced growth, and a distinctive ï¬at facial appearance. Skeletal abnormalities have also been noted in affected individuals;even thought, these features have not been assessed systematically due to the small number of subjects. AYGRPS causing MAF mutations cluster in the GSK3 phosphorylation motif within the N terminal transactivation domain of the protein, and impair proper phosphorylation of MAF, perturbing its activation and stability. Here, wecharacterize clinically and molecularly four additional patients. Expanding the series, we provide a more accurate delineation of the clinical phenotype, particularly focusingon the skeletal features characterizing this disorder. Beside midfacial hypoplasia and joints limitations, we report that delayed bone age, radio ulnar synostosis, carpal/tarsal andlong bone defects, and hip dysplasia variably occur in affected subjects.

Mutations in 22 genes account for 80% of the cases. BBS1 represents the highest fraction of patients with pathogenic variations including for 17% of all BBS patients the c.1169T>G, p. M390R variant. Among the unsolved cases in our cohort, several patients wereheterozygous carriers of this speci ï¬c recurrent mutation suggesting a second allele in BBS1 . Targeted exome sequencing and mobile element insertion (MEI) detection(Mobster) was applied to 200 BBS samples. Whole genome sequencing, de novo assembly and SNP array analysis were performed to characterize the genomic events identi ï¬ed. We identi ï¬ed a few large exons deletions in BBS1 gene. Interestingly, 4 families carried the c.1169T>G variation in trans of a hominid speci ï¬c retrotransposon insertion (SVA F) in exon 13 of BBS1 . We characterized this insertion in the general population (>400 samples screened), determinedthat its sequence of 2435 bp contains hallmarks of LINE1 mediated retrotransposition with a 5 âtruncation compared to the canonical SVA F sequence. We con ï¬rmed our initial ï¬nding (Redin et al, 2012) that MEI is occurring in BBS. We describe 4 new families with the same SVA F insertion inBBS1 . Thus this insertion is now described in 5 families since the initial case reported by Tavares et al (2018). Such ï¬ndings highlight the importance of using dedicated bioinformatics pipelines to identify all types of variations. Our PhD student is supported by a FRM grant (ECO20170637509). C.

Our study aims at reporting phenotype evolutionand health issues in adulthood. Methods: 31 patients (14 males), aged 18 58 years (median 28.45) with BWS were enrolled. Results: 14 patients had IC2 hypomethylation, 5 paternal UPD11, two IC1 hypermethylation, one 11p15.5 micro duplication, 5 negative molecular tests and 4 were not tes ted. Final tall stature was present in 38%. Three patients developed nephroblastoma (2, 3 and 10 years, respectively); one hepatoblastoma (22 years); one acute lymphoblasticleukemia (21 years); one adrenal adenoma and testicular Sertoli cell tumour (22 and 24 years, respectively); and three benign tumours (hepatic haemangioma, uterinemyoma and mammary ï¬broepithelioma). Surgery for BWS related features was required in 84%. Despite surgical correction several patients presented morbidity and sequelaeof BWS pediatric issues: pronunciation/swallow dif ï¬culties (n,8) due to macroglossia, painful scoliosis (n ,4) con sistent with lateralized overgrowth, recurrent urolithiasis(n,4), azoospermia (n ,3) likely consequent to cryptorch idism, severe intellectual disability (n ,2) likely related to neonatal asphyxia and diabetes mellitus (n ,1) due to sub total pancreatectomy for intractable hyperinsulinism. Three1496patients (2 males) had healthy children (two physiologically conceived and one through ART). Conclusions: adult health conditions in BWS are mostly consequent to pediatric issues, underlying the preventive role of follow up strategies in childhood. Malignancy rate observed in early adulthood in this small cohort matchesthat observed in the ï¬rst decade of life, cumulatively raising tumor rate in BWS to 20% during the observation period.

30651,"1CHU Toulouse Purpan, TOULOUSE, France,2CHU Reims, Reims, France Introduction: Branchio oculo facial syndrome (BOFS) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, related tomutations in TFAP2A . This gene encodes for the AP2 Î± protein, which plays a major role in human craniofacial development. While cardinal features of this syndromecommonly involve branchial skin defects, oculo facial abnormalities, and hearing loss, a broad phenotypic variability can hamper the diagnosis in some atypical cases. Case Presentation: We report two siblings and their mother, with a familial history of Pierre Robin sequence without cleft palate, coloboma, pseudo cleft aspect of theupper lip, nasolacrimal duct stenosis and hearing loss, with a broad intra familial variability. Focusing on the severe syndromic Pierre Robin sequence and ear dysplasia in oneaffected child, a gene panel of mandibulofacial dysostosis (EFTUD2 ,POLR1A ,POLR1C ,POLR1D , and TCOF1) was performed without identifying any mutation. A CGH arrayshowed a 22q11.21 microduplication in one of the affected children, assessed as insuf ï¬cient to explain the poly malformative familial phenotype. After a second clinicalevaluation, a diagnosis of branchio oculo facial syndrome was suggested based on the association of âpseudo cleft â defects of the upper lip, coloboma, and nasolacrimal ductstenosis. Speci ï¬c Sanger sequencing of TFAP2A in the index case revealed a predicted pathogenic c.532 +2T>C variant (NM_003220.2) in a heterozygous state, supportingthe diagnosis of BOFS. Conclusion: This case report highlights the broad varia bility of BOFS phenotypic spectrum. However, it empha sizes some distinctive clinical features, which can beunrecognized by clinicians, though highly relevant to reach the accurate diagnosis. V. Ivashchenko: None. S. Julia: None. A.

Up to date there are only 6 reported patients. These patients presented asimilar phenotype with marked neonatal hypotonia, severe growth failure, failure to thrive, profound developmental delay and liver dysfunction leading to early death in the ï¬rst year. We present a 7 thpatient with CADDS, a 2 months old boy who presented severe antenatal and postnatal growth retardation, failure to thrive, irritability, mild hypotonia,transient liver dysfunction with cholestasis and elevated liver enzymes. He also had exocrine and possible endocrine pancreatic de ï¬ciency which has not yet been described. Chromosomal microarray showed a 60kb Xq28 including theï¬rst three exons of the BCAP31 gene, the entire ABCD1 gene and part of the PLXNB3 gene. ABCD1 loss of function mutations lead to X linked Adrenoleucodystrophy, a neurodegenerative condition with broad clinical variability. No cases have been described under the age of 2.7 years.

The patient was a four year old boy. The boy was born at 39 weeks of gestation with apgar index of 3 (1 min) and 6 (5 min). After birth, the boywas soon administrated our hospital due to severe cyanosis. At 4 year of age, the patient showed short stature ( 5 S.

The MAP3K7 gene with the variant was introduced into Drosophila overexpressed eiger(TNFalpha), which was reduced the eye size. Then, the eiger effect was suppressed by the mutant MAP3K7, sug gesting that the variant showed dominant negative effect.

When cleft ofthe palate is associated with a cleft of the lip with preservation of the primary palate, it de ï¬nes an atypical phenotype called discontinuous cleft . Although this pheno type may represent 5% of clefts of the lip and/or palate (CLP), it is rarely speci ï¬cally referred to and its pathophysiology is unknown.

The condition shows clinical and etiologicheterogeneity. The cause of isolated cloverleafskull is unknown, and this feature is a component of at least 15 monogenic disorders which account for majority of allcloverleaf skull syndromes (JM Graham & PA Sanchez Lara, 2016). A diamniotic, dichorionic pregnancy was assessed starting at 20 weeks gestation for skull andpossible brain anomalies by ultrasound and MRI. An initial suspicion of encephaloceles in both fetuses was raised followed by that of craniosynostosis. Genetic testing waspostponed for the postnatal time. The 24 year old G2P1A1 mother experienced PPROM at 28 weeks gestation and delivery took place by C/S at 32w2d gestation. Bothnewborns, a boy and a girl shared the same phenotype including typical craniofacial dysostosis associated with cloverleaf skull, and bilateral parietal encephaloceles,micromelia, no skeletal anomalies, and unilateral kidney dysplasia in one fetus. Extensive genetic testing including targeted sequencing (FGFR1, 2, and 3, TWIST1), cranio synostosis panel, exome sequencing (WES) and chromoso mal microarray (CMA) did not reveal a clear etiology. WES and CMA showed a 2.4 Mb VUS deletion at chromosome18p11.32, seen in gnomAD, shared between the two affected newborns and the father who has a history of an unclear seizure disorder, mild developmental delay and nocraniosynostosis.

Several phenotypes still await etiological elucidation. NEUROG1 encodes Ngn1 which is a basic helix loop helix transcription factor essential for the formation of the trigeminal, vestibule cochlear and accessory nerves. So far it hasn ât been associated with a phenotype in OMIM. Nonetheless, in 2013 Schroder et al (PMID: 23419067) reported a patient with mild developmental delay (DD), bilateral profound sensorineural deafness due to absentbilateral VIII nerves, and severe oromotor dysfunction, who had a homozygous deletion including NEUROG1 . Case description: We describe a 10 year old boy with hypotonia, mild DD, bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss, and keratoconjunctivitis due to lack of corneal reï¬ex and incomplete eye closure. On physical examination he had a long expressionless face, right eye leucocoria, and severe oromotor dysfunction. EMG showed axonal sensory polyneuropathy of the lower limbs. Brain MRI revealedbilateral agenesis/severe hypoplasia of the VIII nerve with marked atresia of the internal auditory canals and cochlear labyrinth malformation. Trio exome identi ï¬ed a homo zygous variant in NEUROG1 (NM_006161.2: c.202G>T, p. Glu68*). This variant is classi ï¬ed as uncertain according to ACMG guidelines, but is considered pathogenic applyingthe ClinGen SVI Bayesian classi ï¬cation framework (pos terior probability 0.997). Conclusions: The resemblance between our case and Schroder âs is remarkable. This case adds support to estab lishing NEUROG1 as a new gene for CCDDs associated with a very distinctive phenotype, and contributes to a betterunderstanding and classi ï¬cation of these disorders.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed whole genome clinical microarray data from 10,797 NDD and 3,174 CHD cases from Ontario to analyze large copy number variations(CNVs). Clinical cytogeneticists identi ï¬ed a consensus set of variants(pathogenic, variant of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS)) based on established guidelines. We have con ducted pathway enrichment and brain single cell tran criptome analysis to identify cell types for pleiotropic genes that are impacted in both NDD and CHD cases. Results: We have identi ï¬ed 186 de novo CNVs from NDD and CHD cases. Our analysis on clinically relevant CNV revealed 573 and 181 pathogenic variants in NDD andCHD, respectively. Similarly, we have identi ï¬ed 4753 and 1361 variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance in NDD and CHD, respectively. Genes with at least one exon impacted bypathogenic(OR ,6.41) and VUS(OR ,6.68) deletions shows signi ï¬cant (P<0.001) overlaps between the NDD and CHD cases. Similar signi ï¬cant overlap was also observed for duplications. âactivation of gtpase activity âpathway showed signi ï¬cance (P<0.001) for the overlapping genes. For example, CLSTN1 gene was found to be impacted by pathogenic variants for both NDD and CHD. Single cellanalysis shows overlapping genes are highly expressed in neurons and astrocytes. Conclusions: We have identi ï¬ed signi ï¬cant overlap of pathogenic and VUS CNVs between NDD and CHD sam ples. This study also shows evidence of speci ï¬c cell types that might contribute to the etiology of NDD and CHD. S. Sa ï¬zadeh Shabestari: None. S. Sopariwala: None. A. Ali: None. N. K.

In Pakistan, the frequency of consanguineousmarriages approaches 70%. To bridge the gap between the 1800 known and the estimated >9000 recessive gene phenotypes, we have initiated a Swiss Pakistani project toidentify novel recessive candidate genes for two pheno types: Intellectual Disability (ID) and Visual Impairment1500(VI). We have collected samples from 1265 individuals of 197 ID, and 1809 individual of 236 VI families of ï¬rst cousin marriages with at least two affecteds. Exome sequence of one affected and genotyping of the whole family (parents, all affected and unaffected siblings) has been completed in 166 ID and 184 VI families to date. Thelikely causative gene/variant in known genes was found in 64% of the VI and 32% in the ID families. Thus, there are more unknown ârecessive genes âfor ID. In 18% of the VI families we have identi ï¬ed 25 novel candidate genes, and in 27% of the ID families 24 such candidates (to be presented in the conference). International genematching identi ï¬ed additional families in 20% of the candidate genes. Careful evaluation of the phenotypes is mandatory to assess the possibility of two or more causative genes in certainfamilies, and to minimize false negative results. Interna tional databases from consanguineous individuals are needed to facilitate the assignment of pathogenicity tohomozygous variants. S. E. Antonarakis: None. S. A. Paracha: None. S. Imtiaz: None.

The underlying genetic defects in a subgroup ofthese cases may be altered expression of disease genes due to copy number variants (CNV) involving regulatory non coding elements. Therefore, in a cohort of cases with suspected genetic diseases who underwent chromosomal microarray analysis, we searched for CNV interposed between relevant disease genes and their corresponding enhancers. Methods: Out of a dataset of 1,176 CNV from 682 patients, we selected CNVs that were: (1) smaller than 1 Mb, (2) devoid of disease genes, and (3) mapped between disease genes and their enhancers. Then, we manuallyanalyzed these gene CNV enhancers groups for con cordance between involved genes and corresponding phe notypes. Finally, we predicted effect of CNV on chromatinfolding by the strings and binders method. Results: 235 CNV (34%) mapped between a disease gene and one of its enhancers and 26 gene phenotype relation ships were consistent after manual evaluation. Among these cases, the best CNV candidate was a 50 kb de novo deletion encompassing a region between sonic hedgehog gene(SHH ) and two of its enhancers, in a patient with limb abnormalities, aortic malformation, cardiac arrythmia, and facial dysmorphisms. Conclusion: Systematic analysis of potential positional effect of CNV has potential for identifying the genetic defects in undiagnosed cases and in our analysis it detecteda CNV affecting contacts of SHH , an important transcrip tion factor involved in development, with its enhancers.

Despite major efforts the molecular mechanisms leading to the morphological and functional brain abnorm alities associated with T21 remain largely unknown. Material and Methods: To clarify the role of differential methylation on transcriptional dysregulation and neurode velopment in T21, we established an induced pluripotentstem cell (iPSC) derived neural cell model showing a transctiptional pro ï¬le comparable to early mid gestationalAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1501period. The DNA methylation pattern was analysed using Illumina HumanMethylation 450k BeadChip and paralleled by RNA sequencing. Results: We assessed the genome wide methylation pat tern in T21 and euploid iPSC neural derivatives and iden tiï¬ed 500 differentially methylated positions (DMPs). Approximately half of DMPs (281 of 500) could be anno tated to a total of 202 genes. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these 202 genes revealed enrichment of neurotransmittertransporters (GO:0006836). Integrated analysis of methy lation and transcriptome data sets revealed altered expres sion in 77 out of the 202 genes in T21 lines. Furthermore,the most profound methylation changes (>9DMPs/gene) associated with differential expression was observed for a cluster of genes ( ZNF69 andZNF700 ) on chromosome 19 encoding zink ï¬nger transcription factors. These ZNF genes have yet unknown functions and are highly expressed during normal embryonic brain development. Conclusion: Our results suggest that differential methy lation contributes to transcriptional dysregulation in T21 neural cells derived from iPSCs. Our study further high lights a set of ZNF transcription factor genes showing profound differential methylation in T21 neurogenesis. L. Laan: None. J. Klar: None. M. Sobol: None. J. Hoeber: None. M.

Material and methods: WES was applied to two trios with undiagnosed patients. A survey of all the clinical features of 17 DPH1 syndrome patients from 7 families wasperformed. The DPH1 enzyme activity of wild type and of 7 disease causing mutants was assessed through the diph theria toxin ADP ribosylation assay. A homology model ofthe human DPH1 DPH2 heterodimer was built, and mole cular dynamics simulations were performed to study the effect of these variants on the catalytic sites, as well as onthe interactions between subunits of the heterodimer. Results: Two DPH1 novel variants were identi ï¬ed in 2 independent families, enriching the clinical delineation ofDPH1 syndrome. The enzyme assay demonstrated com promised functionality for 5 mutations (p. Leu234Pro; p. Ala411Argfs*91; p. Leu164Pro; p. Leu125Pro; p. Tyr112 Cys). According to the structural model, p. Leu125Pro may affect dimerization while p. Tyr112Cys, p. Leu164Pro, p. Leu234Pro and p. Pro382Ser may interfere the binding ofthe iron sulphur cluster necessary for catalysis. Conclusions: The overall good correlation observed between DPH1 protein activity, structural prediction andclinical features indicate that these biochemical and struc tural tests may be useful tools for assessing the pathogeni city of DPH1 variants and for helping to predict the clinicalseverity of future DPH1 cases.

It occurs either alone or in association with other cerebral and/or extracerebral anoma lies. Its association with microlissencephaly is exceedinglyrare and to date, only a heterozygous de novo missense variant in ADGRL2 , a gene encoding Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor L2, has been identi ï¬ed. Here, we report two siblings of Roma origin presenting with severe growth retardation, fetal akinesia, microlissencephaly and small cerebellum with vermian agenesis. Neuropathology showedextreme paucity in pontine transverse ï¬bres, rudimentary olivary nuclei, RES and vanishing motoneurons in both foetuses. Comparative foetus parent exome sequencingrevealed in both foetuses a homozygous variant in exon 1 of the EXOSC3 gene encoding a core component of the RNA exosome, c.92G>C;p.(Gly31Ala). EXOSC3 variants account for 40% to 75% of patients affected by ponto cerebellar hypoplasia with spinal muscular atrophy (PCH1B). The c.92G>C variant is a founder mutation inthe Roma population and has been reported in severe PCH1B. PCH1B is characterized by a broad phenotypic spectrum, ranging from mild phenotypes with spasticity,mild to moderate intellectual disability, distally pronounced muscular atrophy, and cerebellar atrophy, to severe phenotypes with profound global developmental delay,progressive microcephaly, and atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres. The typical dragon ï¬y pattern of the cerebel lum observed in PCH1B patients with ï¬attened hemispheres and relative prominence of vermis differs markedly from RES. This novel foetal presentation expands the spectrum of PCH1B and highlights the diversity of RES aetiologies. M. Vezain: None. F. Marguet: None. M. Bucourt: None. P. Letard: None. A. Delahaye: None.

Studies correlat ing EEG and neuroimaging with speci ï¬c FASD categories are lacking. Material and methods: Classi ï¬cation of 62 patients into 3 FASD categories, including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS) and alcohol related neurodeve lopmental disorders (ARND). Prospective studies of MRimaging and EEG. Results: Neuroimaging: The most frequent ï¬ndings were corpus callosum abnormalities (42%) and cerebellar vermishypoplasia (24%). Additional ï¬ndings were vascular anomalies, gliosis, prominent perivascular spaces, occipito cervical junction and cervical vertebral anomalies, pituitaryhypoplasia, arachnoid cysts, and cavum septum pellucidum. Only 16% had normal neuroimaging. EEG (including sleep recording in 43%) showed anomalies in 23%, includingslowing of background activity and interictal epileptiform discharges, focal and/or generalized, and 3 of them had epilepsy. In one patient, seizures were ï¬rst detected during the EEG recording and one case had an encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus during slow sleep (ESES). Focal interictal discharges in our patients did not imply thepresence of underlying visible focal brain lesions in the neuroimaging studies, such as cortical dysplasia or poly microgyria. However, they had nonspeci ï¬c brain MR abnormalities, including corpus callosum hypoplasia, ver mis hypoplasia or cavum septum pellucidum. The latter was signiï¬cantly more frequent in the group with EEG abnormal ï¬ndings (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Patients with FASD exhibit frequent and diverse neuroimaging and EEG ï¬ndings. S.

Gemelli, IRCCS, UniversitÃ Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy,11University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Introduction: Aberrant activation or inhibition of potas sium (K +) currents across the plasma membrane of cells has been causally linked to altered various functions in both excitable and non excitable cells. KCNK4 belongs to the mechano gated ion channels of the TRAAK/TREK sub family of two pore domain (K2P) K +channels. While K2P channels are well known to contribute to the resting membrane potential/cellular excitability, their involvementin pathophysiological processes remains largely uncharacterized. Materials and Methods: In the frame of the Undiag nosed Patients Program at the Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino GesÃ¹, Rome, the exomes of two unrelated subjects with a molecularly unexplained, clinically superimposable pheno type were scanned to identify the underlying molecular cause. Patch clamp analyses, co expression experiments and molecular dynamics simulations were used to func tionally characterized the genomic ï¬ndings. Results: Two variants in KCNK4 were identi ï¬ed as the only shared events in these two patients and a third wasfound by using GeneMatcher. Patch clamp analyses docu mented an impressive gain of function of the identi ï¬ed KCNK4 channel mutants. Co expression experiments pro vided evidence of the dominant behavior of the disease causing mutations. Remarkably, molecular dynamics simulations consistently indicated that mutations seal thelateral intramembrane fenestration proposed to negatively control K +ï¬ow. Conclusions: We report that de novo missense mutations inKCNK4 cause a recognizable syndrome for which we propose the acronym FHEIG (facial dysmorphism, hyper trichosis, epilepsy, intellectual disability/developmental delay, and gingival overgrowth). Overall, our ï¬ndings illustrate the pleiotropic effect of dysregulated KCNK4function and provide support to the hypothesis of a gating mechanism based on the lateral fenestrations of K2P channels.

A total of 33 patients from 25 families aredocumented worldwide. Previously, we reported the ï¬rst gene ( CKAP2L ) involved in FS. Here, we ascertain a1504mutation in CSNK2B as a likely cause of FS. CSNK2B encodes CK2 Î²âthe beta subunit of casein kinase 2, which plays pivotal role in diverse cellular processes. Material and Methods: To identify the causal variant, trio whole exome sequencing was performed. To further explore the consequences of the mutation, pulldown assays,microscale thermophoresis (MST), immuno ï¬uorescence and RNA seq transcriptome pro ï¬ling of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were conducted. Results: A pathogenic de novo mutation ( CSNK2B: c.94G>C; p. Asp32His) was identi ï¬ed in an Italian patient diagnosed with FS. The mutation caused an up regulation ofCSNK2B expression at transcript and protein level, which resulted in impaired cross talk between Î±andÎ²subunits of CK2. The effects of mutation were also observed in twocrucial pathways; canonical Wnt signaling (CWS) and DNA damage response (DDR). In CWS, an impaired interaction of DVL3 with mutant CK2 Î²and up regulation as well as mis localization of Î² catenin in mutant LCLs was found. In DDR, Î³H2AX was substantially increased in mutant LCLs. Finally, RNA seq data con ï¬rmed differential expression of proteins involved in the aforementioned pathways. Conclusion: Our ï¬ndings suggest that CSNK2B is a novel candidate gene for Fillippi syndrome and the muta tion found in our patient causes the disorder by dysregu lating CWS and DDR. M. Asif: None.

30665,"Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Filamin A (FLNA ) encodes a cytoskeletal protein that regulates cell shape by cross linking actin ï¬laments. Mutations in FLNA have been associated with a wide spectrum of disorders, and more recently with anXâlinked form of Congenital Short Bowel Syndrome (CSBS). These mutations are located between two methio nines present at the N terminal of the protein, and seem to only block expression of the long isoform of FLNA. Material and Methods: To understand the role of FLNA in intestinal development, expression studies at differenthuman embryonic stages, and several in vitro studies were performed. A transgenic zebra ï¬sh line was also generatedusing TALENs, where expression of the long isoform of FLNA was speci ï¬cally blocked. Results: FLNA expression was detected in the muscular layer of the small intestine from early embryonic stages. Moreover, FLNA mutations associated with CSBS, blocked expression of the long isoform of FLNA, but did not affectthe binding of FLNA to actin ï¬laments. These mutations also impaired contractility of human intestinal smooth muscle cells in vitro . Finally, FLNA mutant ï¬sh were phe notypically indistinguishable from wild type ï¬sh, except for a signi ï¬cant reduction in gut length (10%), and diminished intestinal motility. Conclusion: Our results bring new insights into CSBS pathogenesis, by showing that the intestinal defects asso ciated with this disease, are likely caused by impairedsmooth muscle contraction, as a consequence of the loss of expression of the long isoform of FLNA.

The product of this gene, the ï¬bronectin domain III containing protein 3B (also known as factor for adipocyte differentiation 104 (FAD104)) has been identi ï¬ed in mouse models as a positive regulator of adipocytes differentiation but also as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Cranial changes have also been described forFNDC3B knock out mice. Methods: Agilent 180K oligo array CGH analysis and clinical evaluation including a neurodevelopmental evaluation. Results: We report the ï¬rst case of a de novo intragenic microdeletion involving two exons of the FNDC3B gene resulting in an frameshift deletion. The patient is a boy withsubtle dysmorphic facial features and behavioral problemsAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1505within the autism spectrum. The boy is 9 years old and we present the developmental evaluation at different ages. Conclusion: CNVs have contributed much to our understanding of disease development and the underlying mechanism. However, the role of individual genes in dis ease development can be dif ï¬cult to interpret in cases where the deletion includes more genes or expands beyond the boundaries of a single gene. Such deletions may include crucial elements that affects the 3 dimensional structure ofthe genome and therefore affects the function of several genes in the region. This is the ï¬rst case with an intragenic exon deletion in FNDC3B supporting a role for this gene in both craniofacial development and neuro psychiatric development. I. K. YstrÃ¸m: None. R.

While the very ï¬rst genetic test in Morocco was carried out in the nineties, the ï¬rst genetic diagnosis of Noonan syndrome (NS) was performed seven years ago. Thus, the aim of this presentation is to expose results of molecular screening of Noonan syndrome in the central north ofMorocco, and discuss its challenges and perspectives.

After obtaining informed consents, genomic DNAs were extracted from leucocytes. Then, all samples were screened for PTPN11mutations using PCR and direct sequencing. The obtained sequences were analyzed using NCBI bioinformatics tools. Results: We have detected ï¬ve pathogenic missense mutations, one synonymous mutation and three novel intronic duplications. All variants were heterozygous. The pathogenic mutations were clustered on exons three andeight, while most of the non coding variants were localisedin the intron four. Considering only the pathogenic muta tions, PTPN11 mutation rate in our cohort was around 16%. Conclusions: Since the ï¬rst diagnosis of PTPN11 mutations in a Moroccan Noonan family, considerable efforts have been made to improve the genetic services offered to patients. Although several challenges are stillretarding the progress of NS genetic diagnosis in Morocco, the NGS technologies that have recently been installed seems to provide a promising future. I.

Current clinical approach mandates integration of phenotypic data with variant analysis. This study aims to assess the diagnostic yield of NGS ordered by a singleclinician to a single laboratory. Materials and Methods: Data from 120 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Time interval was September2015 January 2019. Tests were performed at Centogene, Germany. All patients were re evaluated after test results. Variants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VUS) were speci ï¬cally re analyzed with evolving clinical story, current literature and results of other investigations. Diagnoses con ï¬rmed by NGS (ACMG Class 1 or 2 variants) were coined as âsug gested molecular diagnosis â. Those established after clinical re analysis were considered ârobust clinical diagnosis â. Results: Median age was 4.7 (0.1 15.1) years. M/F ratio was 1.14. Time passed since ï¬rst symptom until a robust diagnosis was 2.8 (0.1 14.3) years. Blended phenotype was present in 8%. Table 1 summarizes the data. Diagnostic rateof trio based WES was signi ï¬cantly higher than proband only WGS, where both increased after clinical re evaluation. Suggested molecular diagnosis was sig niï¬cantly higher in trio based testing. Consanguinity,1506affected siblings and dysmorphic features did not have an effect on diagnostic rate. Conclusions: Our results emphasize the additional impact of clinical expertise. An experienced clinician familiar withrare disease diagnoses is essential to determine whether a variant is causative, contributory or unrelated. F. B. Bengur: None. E. Kar: None. K. Yararbas: None.

In these patients, deep intronic variation or F8disrupting genomic rearrangement could be causal. Objective: to characterize a Xq28 rearrangement dis rupting F8in a genetically unresolved severe haemophilia A patient. Materials and Methods :a large panel of comprehensive molecular techniques including long range PCR, RNAanalysis, nanopore sequencing and cytogenetic analysis were used. Results: Long range PCR performed throughout F8 identi ï¬ed a non ampli ï¬able region in intron 25 indicating the presence of a chromosomal rearrangement. F8mRNA analysis including 3 âRapid Ampli ï¬cation of cDNA Ends and nanopore sequencing showed the presence of a F8 fusion transcript in which F8exon 26 was replaced by a 742bp pseudo exon corresponding to a non coding region located at the beginning of the long arm of chromosome X (Xq11.1). The pseudo exon was ï¬anked by a canonical AG on its 5 âside and contained two putative polyadenylation signals on its 3 âside. Cytogenetic Microarray Analysis showed the presence of a 3.8 Mb gain of the Xq11.1q12chromosomal region. PCR ampli ï¬cation of junction frag ments and FISH analysis con ï¬rmed that the Xq11.1q12 duplicated region was inserted in F8intron 25. Conclusion: Exceptionally, this structural variant char acterization was conducted from cDNA analysis.

Hofstra1 1Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands,2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital neuropathy characterized by the lack of the enteric nervoussystem in the distal part of the colon. Mutations in more than 20 genes have been identi ï¬ed. One single good in vitro model to determine the functional consequences of thedifferent mutated genes is lacking. In this study we tested whether induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could serve as such a model. Material and Methods: Functional assays of the EDN3 , EDNRB , and ZEB2 variants identi ï¬ed, were performed by overexpressing the corresponding variant in HEK293 cells.qRT PCR and Western Blot were performed to investigate the effect of these mutations on protein expression. In parallel, ï¬ve iPSC lines obtained from ï¬broblasts derived from four HSCR patients carrying the mutations tested, and one individual control were differentiated into Enteric Neural Crest Cells (ENCCs) according a previous describedprotocol. ENCCs differentiation was evaluated using FACS and immunostaining.1508Results: The EDN3 mutant showed lower expression in comparison to the wild type, while the variants in EDNRB and ZEB2 had the opposite effect. iPSC derived ENCCs were positive for the neuronal marker HNK1. However, patient derived iPSCs yield lower percentage of ENCCs than controls. Conclusions: The mutations identi ï¬ed in RET,GFRA1 , EDN3 ,EDNRB andZEB2 showed signi ï¬cant differences on protein expression, and seem to impair iPSCs differentiationinto ENCCs. However, further studies are needed to fully characterize the effect of these mutations on the iPSC derived ENCCs to show whether indeed iPSCs are theperfect model system for HSCR. A. Zada: None. K.

PALM2 encodes paralemmin 2, a para lemmin family plasma membrane protein, and AKAP2encodes an A kinase anchor protein. PALM2 and AKAP2 are adjacent on chromosome 9 and can form fusion transcripts. PALM2 has been implicated in cHH, since adeleterious PALM2 mutation has been found in one cHH patient. A chromosomal translocation causing monoallelic expression of AKAP2 has been found in another patientwith Kallmann syndrome (cHH and anosmia/hyposmia) and bone anomalies. Materials and Methods: Targeted sequencing of ANOS1, CHD7, FGF8, FGFR1, GNRHR, KISS1R, PROK2, PROKR2 and TACR3 and subsequent whole genome linked read sequencing was performed on a patientwith cHH, anosmia, learning dif ï¬culties and motoric pro blems. We Sanger sequenced the coding regions and exon intron boundaries of PALM2 and AKAP2 in 22 FinnishcHH patients who have no mutations in currently known cHH genes. Results: The patient carried a 2.3 Mb chromosomal deletion at 9q31.2 that excludes PALM2/AKAP2. Targeted sequencing revealed no other causative mutations or novel rare variants in this proband. In our patient set, no likely causative mutations were found. Conclusions: We report a patient with a deletion at 9q31.2 yet intact PALM2 and AKAP2 genes. The roles of PALM2 and AKAP2 in Kallmann syndrome require further investigations.

Most OGS has additional features associated such as intellectual disability. Thus, the aim of this project was to perform a molecular screening of OGSwith ID and to understand the underlying physio pathogenic associated mechanisms. Material and Methods: Patients were selected retro spectively from the Spanish Overgrowth registry database (SOGRI). Molecular analysis included Sanger sequencing, MLPA and a custom NGS panel of 211 genes (Overgrowthv2.3). Variants annotation and prioritization was performed with a custom in house bioinformatic script. Results: A subgroup of patients with OGS +ID caused by mutations in chromatin regulation genes was observed: (5) BRWD3 (X linked mental retardation), (6) DNMT3A (Tat ton Brown Rahman syndrome), (2) SETD2 (Luscan Lumish syndrome), (3) EZH2 (Weaver syndrome), (99) NSD1 (Sotos syndrome).Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1509Conclusions: There is a high relationship between patients who present some overgrowth disorders with intellectual disability, with alterations in chromatin reg ulatory genes. These genes encode enzymes that possess histone methyltransferase activity, and therefore, are critical during the processes of human development.

30676,"Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, ItalyInterstitial deletions in 2q24.2q24.3 are rare events reported in literature and in publicly available databases associatedmainly with developmental delay and intellectual disability. The breakpoint of these deletions varies, extending from 7.5 Mb to 2.3 Mb. Although some clinical features seem to berecurrent, these deletions are associated with a clinically heterogeneous phenotype. This is probably due to the different deletion size and gene content, to genetic variationin the remaining allele and to the in ï¬uence of the genetic background of the rest of the genoma. Here we report on two patients with similar clinical phenotype and interstitial2q24.2q24.3 deletions of different size overlapping a 1.7 Mb region. In particular, patient 1 was characterized by hypotonia, growth retardation, and psychomotor develop mental and language delay, dysmorphisms and hearing loss with a de novo 3,7 Mb 2q24.2q24.3 deletion. Patient 2 presented with hypotonia, psychomotor and language delay,stereotypes movements and epilepsy with a de novo 2,9 Mb 2q24.2q24.3 deletion. We identi ï¬ed the smallest region of1510overlap encompassing eight genes and our attention was particularly drawn to SLC4A10, DPP4, KCNH7 . All these three genes are associated to neurological features. SLC4A10 is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, where it regulates the neuronal intracellular pH. Abnormal levels of DPP4 were seen in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. KCNH7 encodes a voltage gated potassium channels and is widely expressed in human central nervous system. In conclusion, haploinsuf ï¬ciency of these genes may be a good candidate for the main clinical features of this emerging syndrome. E. Tassano: None. L. Pisciotta: None. S. Uccella: None. T.

Intellectual disability (ID) is constant, and anomalies of the corpus callosum (ACC) are present in 80% of (invdupdel[8p]) patients. Almost all reported patientscarry the same 8pter deletion, but the size and proximal breakpoint of the duplication are variable. Previous studies suggested a correlation between the size of the duplicationand the severity of ID. Moreover, Sajan et al. (2013) de ï¬ned a minimal duplicated critical region of 10.7 Mb associated with ACC. However, no gene of ACC has yet been clearlyidenti ï¬ed in this region. In order to re ï¬ne genotype phenotype correlation in this complex rearrangement, we report clinical and chromosomal data from 29 new patientswith invdupdel[8p]. Patients and Method: 3 fetus and 26 patients (mean age: 9.7 years) were included. CGH/SNP array were performedfor all of them. Results: All living patients (n ,26/26) had developmental delay and ID (n ,5/22 mild and n ,17/22 moderate to severe). 16/22 patients had ACC (4 complete agenesis, 7 partial agenesis, and 5 dysplasia), associated with other cerebral abnormalities in 11 patients. Mean size of thedeletion was 6.9 Mb and duplication was 19.2 Mb. Dis cussion Conclusion: As expected, the severity of ID is correlated with the size of the duplication. Our study re ï¬nes the minimal duplicated critical region for ACC to a 1.7 Mb long region spanning one gene only, which is a new can didate gene for ACC. R. Vibert: None. B. Keren: None. S.

Corpus callosum anomalies have been described in 16% of patients. We report here 2 unrelated patients with a de novoKMT2A heterozygous variant presenting with isolated prenatal agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), and a normal psychomotor development. Patients: Patient 1:partial ACC was diagnosed prenatally. At 4 years and 6 months of age, he had normal psychomotor development, whereas attention and praxic disorders were observed,especially in ï¬ne motor skills. The WPPSI III at 4 years Â½ showed a heterogenous pro ï¬le. In addition, he had postnatal weight growth retardation ( 2SD) and dysmorphic features. Patient 2: ACC was diagnosed prenatally. At the age of 8 years, he had normal neurodevelopment. WPPSI IV performed at 5 years was in a normal range, with aheterogenous pro ï¬le. Mild dysmorphic features were observed. Methods: Trio based Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed in the 2 male patients and their non consanguineous and unaffected parents. Results: Patient 1: WES analysis detected a novel de novo heterozygous missense variant in KMT2A (c.4256G>A; p. Gly1419Asp), predicted as probably damaging by all prediction tools. Patient 2: WES analysisdetected a de novo heterozygous truncating variant in KMT2A (c.1539del; p. Ile515Phefs*52). Conclusions: These two observations expand the WDSTS phenotypic spectrum, since ID may be absent. Thus, this syndrome might be considered in cases of iso lated corpus callosum anomalies, associated with normaldevelopment. E. Marchionni: None. S. Heide: None. C. Depienne: None. A. Rastetter: None.

The English patient, aged 6, diagnosed by NGS panel for syndromic overgrowth (de novo PDGFRB c.1751C>G variant), had tall stature, craniosy nostosis, facial features, progressive contractures and developmental delay. The Norwegian patient, aged 9, diagnosed by WES (de novo PDGFRB c.1696T>C variant) had tall stature, severe scoliosis, facial features and devel opmental delay. Long term outcome in the oldest patient revealed an evolving phenotype with persistent tall staturedespite severe scoliosis not accessible to surgery (188 cm), extremely fragile skin with diffuse erythrosis, dystrophic scars due to multiple injuries, nail dystrophy, progressivecamptodactyly, early osteoporosis, basilar artery aneurysm complicated by a stroke, and severe ocular impairment due1512to complicated surgeries for pterygions. The patient had normal intelligence, with no cognitive decline nor cerebral calciï¬cations. Conclusion: Genotype ï¬rst approach is a powerful approach to reach the diagnosis of ultra rare syndromes. Indeed, the clinical diagnosis was not raised before NGS,due to the lack of knowledge of this entity. B. Chalot: None. A. Foster: None. E. Schaeffer: None. C. Rustad: None. K. Tveten: None. T.

Material and Methods: Based on a national collabora tion, we described the clinical features of 31 patients with MCAP syndrome carrying mosaic PIK3CA pathogenic variants. The objective of this study was to better de ï¬ne the clinical features of patients with MCAP syndrome in con nection with imaging features, to improve diagnosis andmanagement. Results: The mosaic rate was between 0% and 20% in the blood, between 1% and 47% in the skin, and between 4%and 34% in the saliva. Macrocephaly had been observed in 21/28 patients (75%) at birth, and in 26/28 patients (93%) at time of the diagnosis. Hemihypertrophy was noticed in 22patients (71%). Intellectual disability was present in 15 patients (50%), ranging from mild to severe, 4 patients had learning disabilities (12%). Six patients suffered from sei zures (20%). Cerebral malformations were reported in 23/26 patients: ventriculomegaly (65%), megalencephaly (53%), cerebellar tonsilla ectopia (35%), polymicrogyria (15%).Correlations between neurogognitive development and cerebral malformations were made. All patients had cuta neous vascular malformation: angioma (53%), cutis mar morata (29%), capillary malformations (26%). Internal vascular anomalies are reported on 5 patients (16%). Limb and distal anomalies were also observed. Conclusion: This study con ï¬rms the large clinical het erogeneity in MCAP, in particular in the neurocognitive development.

30681,"Canada,2Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States Microcephaly capillary malformation syndrome (MIC CAP) is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized bycongenital microcephaly, multiple capillary malformations, hypoplastic distal phalanges, infantile onset intractable seizures, profound neurologic impairment and abnormalneuroimaging ï¬ndings including a diffusely simpli ï¬ed cortical gyral pattern with increased extra axial space. It is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the STAMBP gene and has been reported in only 14 individuals worldwide, to date. Given the rarity, the full phenotypic spectrum remains poorly understood with limited natural history and prog nosis information, as well as guidelines on optimal medical management. Additionally, there is one reported individual with a mild phenotype suggesting variable severity, withinsufï¬cient data to de ï¬ne genotype phenotype correlations. Here we present a case series of patients with MIC CAP obtained through a prospective well designed online surveyof their primary caregivers and physicians. In this study, we describe the most frequently reported features, management and impact on disease course. We speci ï¬cally focused on hallmark features leading to morbidity and decreased life span including seizures, neurologic impairment and respiratory insuf ï¬ciency. We report the various therapies used by affected individuals and perceived bene ï¬ts of these therapies including anti epileptics medications. Addition ally, we describe the spectrum of severity of other majorfeatures in previously reported individuals, including anadditional seven who have not been reported in the litera ture to identify genotype phenotype correlations. Improved understanding of the hallmark features, including those leading to morbidity and mortality, in MIC CAP syndrome will facilitate early diagnosis, inform man agement strategies and provide prognostic information.

Mutations in ï¬ve genes have been identi ï¬ed as its cause, but the majority of cases are caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the Î³ smooth muscle actin gene (ACTG2 ).ACTG2 encodes for an actin isoform speci ï¬cally expressed in the intestinal and urogenital tracts. Previousstudies by us and others, have shown that mutated ACTG2 disrupt actin polymerization and result in reduced cellular contractility. However, the mechanisms underlying theseeffects are still unknown. Materials and Methods: Wild type and mutant ACTG2 proteins fused to a GFP and mCherry tag respectively, werestably expressed in U2OS cells and human intestinal smooth muscle cells. Transfected cells were analyzed by immuno ï¬uorescence, actin polymerization and cellular contractility assays. In Parallel, ï¬broblasts derived from two MMIHS patients carrying ACTG2 mutations, and three controls have been used for trans differentiation assays. Immuno ï¬uorescence, qRT PCR, and a TGF beta reporter assay were performed, to investigate the effect of ACTG2 mutations on cellular differentiation. Results: Actin polymerization, and cellular contractility were signi ï¬cantly impaired when the mutant ACTG2 pro tein is expressed, alone or in combination with the wild type. Furthermore, TGF beta is up regulated in ï¬broblasts derived from MMIHS patients when compared to controls.1514Conclusion: ACTG2 mutations lead to a dysregulation of the TGF beta pathway, and reduce cellular contractility by exerting a dominant negative effect in MMIHS.

30683,"Background: Multimorbidity is increasing in younger adults but is understudied in the general population. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) could act as a genetic model of multimorbidity in young to middle agedadults. Methods: Using Anatomic Therapeutic Classi ï¬cation (ATC) and setting 5 or more concurrent prescription med ications as a proxy for multimorbidity, we compared data on 264 adults with 22q11.2DS (median age 27.8, range 17.3 68.3 years) to that for a community based general popula tion sample in Canada (n ,25,287). We used logistic regression to examine possible predictors of multimorbidity in 22q11.2DS. Results: Multimorbidity in 22q11.2DS in the 25 44 year age group (34.7%) was signi ï¬cantly more prevalent than in the general population, both for the same age group (2.9%,prevalence ratio, PR ,11.9) and compared to those aged 45 64 years (16.4%, PR ,2.1). Neuropsychiatric and endocri nological ATC medication classes predominated. Within22q11.2DS, older age and psychotic illness, but not sex, major congenital heart disease or intellectual disability, were signi ï¬cant predictors of multimorbidity. Conclusion: The results indicate that adults with 22q11.2DS have a signi ï¬cant burden of illness with levels of multimorbidity comparable to those of the generalpopulation several decades older. In younger adults with multimorbidity, certain disease patterns may also help identify genetic disorders in âbig data â. A. S. Bassett: None. S. L. Malecki: None.",2019

Most fetuses remaining undiag nosed deprive couples of obtaining precise geneticcounseling and molecular diagnosis in future pregnancies. This limited yield is explained by fetal wide phenotypic variability and dif ï¬culties to de ï¬ne precise phenotypes. Here, we aimed to assess the contribution of ES to diagnose MCA fetuses and also identify new genes. We performed singleton ES in 95 MCA fetuses undiagnosed after currentinvestigations. Fetal DNA quantity/quality permitted ES in only 95/151 fetuses. The strategy combined usual indivi dual ES analysis and an original cohort analysis based onbioinformatics scores and variant databases independently of fetal phenotype. We selected variants on the following criteria: truncating with a signi ï¬cant probability of loss of function intolerance (pLI ,0.9 1), reported in denovo db database, reported (likely) pathogenic in ClinVAR database, or with probably recessive mode of inheritance. Usualindividual ES identi ï¬ed pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 21/95 fetuses (22%). The cohort analysis identi ï¬ed not only these 21 variants but also additional pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 3/95 fetuses (4%), increasing the diagnostic yield from 22% to 25%. 9 candidate genes were suspected in 8/95 fetuses (8%)remaining to be replicated. In conclusion, this original strategy increased the diagnostic yield in a fetal cohort with atypical or non described phenotype and could so beapplied to other heterogeneous cohorts with developmental abnormalities.

30685,"Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy Recurrent microdeletion and microduplication syndromes are among the most common causes of human neurodeve lopmental and psychiatric disorders. These reciprocalgenomic disorders often result from non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between near identical segmental duplications. Copy number changes mediated by segmentalduplications may be either pathogenic or may exist as benign variants in the human population. However, almost all pathogenic CNVs are characterized by a range of phenotypic outcomes (variable expressivity) and by unaffected family members who carry the same CNV (incomplete penetrance). Here we report a boy withmild intellectual disability, speech delay, and hypotonia presenting a 1.56 Mb interstitial deletion at 2q12.2 12.3 inherited from his healthy father. The microdeletionincludes three OMIM genes, of which ST6GAL2 , in our opinion, is the most interesting. This gene encodes a beta galactoside alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase expressed in brainand its transcription could be potentially activated for spe ciï¬c neuronal functions. In the literature four cases have been reported with microdeletions/microduplications com prising ST6GAL2 gene and associated with neurological diseases. In DECIPHER database seventeen individuals have been identi ï¬ed with deletions similar to that of our case and neurological disease as intellectual disability, delayed speech, autism. Ten patients inherited the deletion from an apparently unaffected parent. It is interesting tonote that all these microdeletions are very similar in extension and are possibly mediated by NAHR. In conclusion, we describe a new recurrent microdeletion 2q12.2 12.3 containing the ST6GAL2 gene, which may be a signiï¬cant and independent risk factor for neurological diseases acting in association with other factors to modifyneurological phenotypes.

It modulates PI3K AKT signaling and controls cranial neural crest cell delamination during facial morphogenesis. SPECC1L causative variants were ï¬rst identi ï¬ed in individuals with oblique facial clefts. Recently, causative variants in SPECC1L were reported in a pedigree reported in 1988 as atypical Opitz GBBB syndrome. Six families with SPECC1L variants have been reported thus far. We report here eight further pedigrees with SPECC1L variants, including a three generation family, and a further individual of a previously published family. We discuss the nosology of Teebi and GBBB, and the syndromes related toSPECC1L variants. Although the phenotype of individuals with SPECC1L mutations shows overlap with OpitzAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1517syndrome in its craniofacial anomalies, the canonical laryngeal malformations and male genital anomalies are not observed. Instead, individuals with SPECCL1 variants have branchial ï¬stulae, omphalocele, diaphragmatic her nias, and uterus didelphis. We also point to the clinical overlap of SPECC1L syndrome with mild Baraitser Winter craniofrontofacial syndrome: they share similar dysmorphic features (wide, short nose with a large tip, cleft lip and palate, blepharoptosis, retrognathia, and craniosynostosis),although intellectual disability, neuronal migration defect, and muscular problems remain largely speci ï¬c to Baraitser Winter syndrome. In conclusion, we suggest that patientswith pathogenic variants in SPECC1L should not be described as âdominant (or type 2) Opitz GBBB syn drome â, and instead should be referred to as âSPECC1L syndrome âas both disorders show distinctive, non over lapping developmental anomalies beyond facial communalities.

30688,"Establishing robust clinical diagnostic criteria for mosaic disorders is dif ï¬cult because of variation in the number of mutant cells amongst patients. Using Proteus syndrome as an example, a patient with a high level of mutant cells is easy to diagnose, but one with few mutant cells may beimpossible to recognize. Also, some tumors have the AKT1 c.49G>A p.(E17K) variant, and this is not Proteus syndrome. Also, some aspects of the phenotype are notunique to Proteus syndrome. We therefore recognize that proper diagnosis must integrate both clinical and molecular aspects. To address this, we have developed an integrated,clinical molecular diagnostic system that de ï¬nes a robust threshold for Proteus syndrome stricto sensu and a broader category of what we term âAKT1 related overgrowth spectrum â. Each Proteus syndrome manifestation is assigned a weighted score with associated manifestationsreceiving a positive, weighted score (e.g., the cerebriform connective tissue nevus) and each atypical manifestation receiving a negative, weighted score (e.g., congenital, non CNS overgrowth). The presence of an AKT1 mosaic variant was assigned a high positive score. We piloted these criteria on the NIH mosaic overgrowth cohort and adjusted andadapted them to achieve agreement on appropriate thresh olds. We suggest that this semi quantitative, integrated clinical molecular diagnostic approach is generalizable toother mosaic disorders, with its most important contribution being the formal recognition that patients with lower variant burdens have a related, but distinct and milder disorder thatmust be differentiated from the classic form of the disorder.

Mother reported severe nausea and vomiting during early pregnancy, birth at term, pelvic presentation, Apgar 10. Medical history revealed multiplecorrective orthopedic surgeries such as osteotomies and elongations/tendon transpositions for the skeletal abnorm alities, operated and recidivate varus equin, bilateral genuvalgum operated and relapsed, atrial septal defect without indication for surgery, moderate mental retardation, primary nocturnal enuresis, mixt astigmatism. She was diagnosedwith cerebral palsy, spastic diparesis, periventricular leukomalacia. Clinical and functional evaluation revealed normal height, 174 cm, overweight, microcephaly, hyperte lorism, epicantus, bilateral corneal leukoma, divergent strabismus, low set ears and mandibular prognathism. She had many bone and joint anomalies such as clinodactily,right varus equin, bilateral genu valgum with marked latero lateral and antero posterior instability, congenital right hip dislocation with femoral head necrosis, congenital left hipsubluxation, shortening of the right lower limb by 2 cm, right radial head subluxation with functional impairment of1518the right elbow, hyperextension of the left elbow, moderate motor de ï¬cit and muscular hypotonia in both lower limbs, dorso lumbar sinistro convex scoliosis, dorsal kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, generalized ligamentous laxity. She was able to walk independently with right knee marked deviation in valgus, typical cerebral palsy gait.

The clinical manifestations in PROS depend on the time and place during the embryonic development in which the mutationoccurred. One of the most recognizable syndromes within the PROS spectrum is CLOVES (Congenital Lipomatous Overgrowth, Vascular malformations, Epidermal nevi,Scoliosis/Skeletal/Spinal anomalies), which presents a larger clinical severity associated with a wide distribution of affected tissues due to the appearance of early mutations. Recently, we have described that Generalized Lymphatic Anomaly (GLA) may also be caused by somatic, activating mutations in PIK3CA . An intriguing clinical feature in GLA is the presence of osteolysis associated with hyperplastic lymphatics in bone. It is not known why bone loss occurs in GLA but has not been described in isolated lymphaticmalformations or in the rest of the PROS syndromes with more pleiotropic clinical features. We present a patient with a clinical diagnosis of CLOVES, in whom there is also avertebral lytic lesion accompanied by a venous/lymphatic component. The patient shows the variant PIK3CA: c.241G>A;p. Glu81Lys, detected in a mosaic of 8.53% inthe affected tissue and absent in blood and saliva samples. This is the ï¬rst description of phenotypic overlap betweenosteolysis and other PROS spectrum syndromes, supporting the inclusion of GLA within this spectrum.

The timing and location of the PIK3CA mutations can explain the phenotypic heterogeneity within PROS. Here, we present a 4 year old male individual (P1) and an18 year old female individual (P2) with a PROS phenotype with isolated muscle overgrowth of upper limbs and ectopic muscles. P1 had four ectopic muscles and unilateral isolatedmuscle overgrowth and P2 had 13 ectopic muscles and bilateral symmetric isolated muscle overgrowth of upper limbs.

The mutation in P1 might have occurred after day 21 post fertilization since his muscular overgrowth is unilateral.

This studywas performed to delineate the clinical and genetic features of children with PWS. Methods: The clinical signs were studied. Karyotype, ï¬uorescence in situ hybridization, methylation speci ï¬c polymerase chain reaction and subsequent methylation speciï¬c multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ï¬cation were used to describe characteristics of genetic classes of PWS. Data were collected on 101 patients with a molecular diagnosis of PWS at Vietnam National Children âs Hospital. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 30.2 months. Most patients who showed the characteristics of facial dysmorphism. 92.1% had neonatal hypotonia and feedingdifï¬culties, 61.4% of the neonates were hospitalized, 11.8% had obesity, 79.6% showed developmental delays and cryptorchidism was 84%. Among 101 patients, 51 patientshad been treated with growth hormon (GH) and GH treat ment resulted in an increase of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) and a decrease in obesity. Deletion subtype waspresent in 86 patients (85.1%), 4 patients had a transloca tion, one case is an unique PWS deletions. mUPD, ID wereobserved in 15 patients (14.9%). Signi ï¬cantly older mothers (mean age ,31.9 years vs 28.2 years) were found in the mUPD, ID group compared with the deletion subtype. Conclusions: The mean age at diagnosis was late. Increase IGF 1 and decrease obesity rate after GH treat ment. The risk of mUPD may also increase with maternalage or this suggests that ethnic differences be relevant for PWS. L. T. An: None. N. T.H.

Recent studies have shown an increase in survival estimates in the last 20years. The hypothesis is that it is due to preventative measures to avoid morbid obesity. The PWS Association (PWSA) USA created a long standing bereavement andresearch program to investigate causes of death and collect data in living individuals with PWS. A familial response questionnaires from the PWSA (USA), tested the hypoth esis that body mass index (BMI), age of diagnosis, clinical symptoms, and growth hormone treatment differ among deceased and living individuals with PWS. Data wereavailable on a total of 2,029 individuals with PWS (114 deceased and 1,915 living) from the USA. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using chi square andtwo group t tests, respectively. For categorical variables, the effect of age was limited by stratifying for age (<20y v. â¥20y) and birth year (<1994 v. â¥1994) and testing with a Mantel Haenszel test. For continuous variables, the effect of age was limited by adjusting for age as a continuous1520variable in logistic regression. Average age at death was 31.6 years. Deceased individuals had lower rates of growth hormone use (p<0.001) and higher rates of increased weight compared to living individuals. BMI in living and deceased individuals with PWS were 28.6 (SD ,11.9) and 51.7 (SD,21.7), respectively (p<0.001).

The use of speci ï¬c inhibitors to target PI3K or mTOR in PROS was recently found to lead to disease regression. However, the downstream effectors of the PI3K/mTOR pathways speciï¬cally involved in the pathogenicity of PROS remain unknown. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is the major stress responsive transcription factor. Recent ï¬ndings indicate that AKT phosphorylates and activates HSF1independently of heat shock in breast cancer cells. We aimed to investigate the role of HSF1 in PROS. We found elevated phosphorylation and activation of HSF1 in cells from PROS patients, which are directly cor related to the presence of activated form of AKT. In line with its function as a transcription factor, active HSF1localized in the nucleus of cells from PROS but not in control donors. Inhibition of PI3K or mTOR activity strongly reduced HSF1 activation in patient cells. Messen ger RNA expression of 47 genes that are known to be regulated by HSF1 were repeatedly down expressed upon PI3K inhibition. We also observed that targeting HSF1 withspeciï¬c inhibitors reduced the proliferation of mutant cells as efï¬ciently as PI3K or mTOR inhibitors. The increased number of cells entering the S phase of the cell cycle, whichis characteristic of PROS, was completely blunted by HSF1inhibitors. Interestingly, CCND2, a major cell cycle reg ulatory protein was down expressed upon functional inhi bition of HSF1.

We report a boy with a PUF60 variant and coloboma, congenital heart disease, and short stature. He was born uneventfully to healthy unrelated parents, with around average birth weight and height. Heunderwent surgical ligation at 7 months for symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. He had recurrent febrile seizures in infancy. He walked by 17 months and spoke his ï¬rst word by 15 months. His facial features include a square face, webbed neck, broad nasal bridge, long eyelashes, dark thick eyebrows, ï¬at philtrum, thin upper vermilion and dental crowding. His square face and large teeth were similar to KBG syndrome. He had a right choroidal coloboma (corrected visual acuity 0.06), short stature (Z score 2.5)and borderline head circumference.

We hypothesized that routine rWES will profoundly increase genetic diagnoses for critically ill newborns, leading to improved patient care. Therefore we performed a clinical utility study assessing the value of genetic testingin routine neonatal clinical practice. In a multi centre prospective study set up, 60 critically ill newborns with a presumed genetic disorder received rWES, parallel toroutine genetic testing. To obtain insight into the prevalence of genetic testing in the ï¬rst 30 days of life, historical data from all 1423 patients admitted to the NICU in theRadboudumc (October 2013 to October 2015) served as a control period. Prospectively, a conclusive molecular diag nosis was obtained in 19 of 60 patients (31.7%), with amedian time to diagnosis of 14 days (IQR 11 21). In comparison, genetic testing was performed in 149 patients (10.5%) in the control period, leading to a conclusivemolecular diagnosis within 30 days of life in 13 of them (8.7%). The median time to diagnosis was 14 days (IQR 12 15). Importantly, from our control period, we noticedthat in a further 136 patients (9.6%) genetic test reports outlasted the ï¬rst 30 days of life, but increased the diagnostic yield to 32.2%. This suggests that more NICUpatients may bene ï¬t from rWES than currently tested. Our data show that the introduction of rWES for all critically ill newborns with a presumed genetic disorder increasesdiagnostic yield earlier in life than conventional diagnostic tests. A. C.

In many patients hypotelorism and mild skeletal anomalies in the hands or feet have been reported. No causative gene of SR/BRSS has been found to date. We present the clinical characteristics of two boys with severe developmental delay and dysmorphic features suggestive of SR/BRSS. In both,blepharophimosis, cleft or high arched palate, hypospadias, scoliosis, and arachnodactyly with clinodactyly were observed. Additionally microcephaly, arched eyebrow, highnarrow nasal bridge, long hanging columella, micrognathia, hypoplastic earlobes, hypermobile joints have been noted. The same novel de novo mutation, HNRNPH1 c.616C>T (p. Arg206Trp), was found in both patients using whole exome sequencing. To date, mutations in the highly conserved autosomal HNRNPH1 gene have not been associated with human disease. HNRNPH1 belongs to the group of nuclear ribonucleoproteins involved in regulation of pre mRNAs splicing. Interestingly, the identical recurrentmutation affecting the small domain encoding nuclear localization signal in the highly paralogous HNRNPH2 gene has been previously associated with X linked, syndromic,Bain type mental retardation [MRXSB, OMIM #300986]. MRXSB has been identi ï¬ed in females with developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, hypotonia, and sei zures. Only in single cases hypotelorism, small palpebral ï¬ssures, or elongated ï¬ngers were observed. Although defective function of HNRNPH2 and HNRNPH1 proteinshave similar clinical consequences in regards to intellectual disability, mutations in HNRNPH1 gene may represent a distinct syndrome perhaps related or identical to Schilbach Rott/Blepharofacioskeletal Syndrome.

Affected individuals died by the age of four. Brain MRI demonstrated microcephaly, semilobar holoprosencephally and agenesisof corpus callosum. We aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of this disease. Methods: Genome wide linkage analysis combined with whole exome sequencing were performed to identify disease causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated in fruit ï¬ies null mutant for the Drosophila SEC31A orthologue. SEC31A knockout SH SY5Y and HEK293T cell lines were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 and studied through qRT PCR, immunoblotting and viabi lity assays. Results: Through genetic studies, we identi ï¬ed a disease associated homozygous nonsense mutation in SEC31A .W e demonstrate that SEC31A is ubiquitously expressed, and that the mutation triggers nonsense mediated decay of its transcript, comprising a practical null mutation. Similar tothe human disease phenotype, knockdown SEC31A ï¬ies had defective brains and early lethality. Moreover, in line with SEC31A encoding one of the two coating layers comprising the COP II complex, traf ï¬cking newly synthe sized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated SEC31A null mutant cells demon strated reduced viability through upregulation of ER stress pathways. Conclusions: We demonstrate that a severe neurological syndrome is caused by a null mutation in SEC31A, redu cing cell viability through enhanced ER stress response, in line with SEC31A âs role in the COP II complex.

FSHD2 is a digenic hereditary disease with heterozygous variants anywhere inSMCHD1 causing toxic derepression of DUX4 , a gene that is embedded in the D4Z4 repeat on chromosome 4 variant 4A. BAMS also requires missense variants in SMCHD1,but speci ï¬cally in the ATPase domain. Irrespective of the phenotypic outcome, both FSHD2 and BAMS associated SMCHD1 variants result in quanti ï¬able hypomethylation of the D4Z4 locus. We identi ï¬ed numerous new pathogenic FSHD2 variants and non pathogenic variants and compared these to BAMS associated variants. M&M: Genetic andmethylation studies of D4Z4 and SMCHD1 in 91 new FSHD2 families. Examination of the position and mutation type for SMCHD1 variants in 180 (89 from previouspublications) FSHD2 families, 41 BAMS patients and 57 control individuals. Generation of a 3D model for the SMCHD1 ATPase domain in which we modeled allmissense variants in FSHD2 and BAMS. Results: The FSHD2 mutation spectrum shows missense, nonsense, indels and splice site variants covering the entireSMCHD1 locus, but missense variants are speci ï¬cally enriched in the ATPase domain.

Conclusions: The localization within the ATPase domain might underlie the phenotypic outcome of missense variants in the ATPase domain of SMCHD1. Funded by NIH andPrinses Beatrix Spierfonds. R. J.L.

Affected individuals presented with a severe syndromic developmental disorder, and a mouse model revealed the embryonic lethality of bi allelic Smg9 deï¬ciency, in a context of major brain, eye and cardiovas cular malformations. To our knowledge, no additional patient has been described since this report. Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing in a patient exhibiting a syndromic developmental delay and in her unaffected parents and report the phenotypic features. Results: Our patient was born to consanguineous parents at 28 weeks of gestation. During pregnancy follow up, left cleft lip and alveolus, polyhydramnios and intrauterinegrowth restriction were noticed. Postnatal examination revealed prominent forehead, hypertelorism, ears abnorm alities, cataracts, kyphosis, renal hypoplasia, as well ascomplex ventricular septal defects and aortic bicuspid valve on cardiac ultrasound and thin corpus callosum and dilated ventricles on brain MRI at the age of 12 months. She pre sented early and severe feeding dif ï¬culties, severe growth restriction, global developmental delay, and multiple severe infections requiring hospitalizations. She carried a novelc.1177C>T, p.(Gln393*) (NM_019108) SMG9 homo zygous variant while her unaffected parents were both heterozygous. Conclusions: We con ï¬rm that bi allelic truncating SMG9 variants cause a severe brain and heart malformation syn drome including ventricular septal defects, brain abnorm alities, facial dysmorphic features, and severe growth and developmental delay (4/4) with or without ophthalmological abnormalities (3/4), severe feeding dif ï¬culties (2/3), and life threatening infections (2/4).

Until now, only missense variants with a functionally characterized partial loss of function (LoF) have been described. Here we report the ï¬rst complete LoF variant in a male patient with a congenital form of SRS. Patient and Methods: The patient had multiple malformations with antenatal onset and died at 4 months ofage after staying in the intensive care unit. His phenotype included IUGR, cysts of the vermis, facial dysmorphism, hypotonia with no eye contact, complex cardiac, gut andkidney malformations. His DNA and that of his parents were sent to our genetics laboratory to perform whole exome sequencing. Functional studies have been performedto validate a variant found by WES: western blot analysis to quantitatively determine the protein level of SMS and UPLC MS/MS to qualitatively determine the enzymeactivity. Results: Genomic analysis revealed a de novo hemi zygous frameshift in SMS, c.906_909delAATG; p. M303Kfs3, classi ï¬ed as pathogenic according to the ACMG criteria. Functional in vitro assays showed a com plete absence of functional SMS protein. Conclusion: Taken together, our ï¬ndings con ï¬rm that the mechanism of pathogenicity in SRS is a LoF in SMS and that complete LoF leads to a far more severe phenotype thanpartial LoF due to missense variants.

We report theï¬rst case of mosaic ring shaped sSMC derived from chromosomes 1 and 10 in a child with dysmorphisms reminiscent of Kabuki Syndrome (KS). KS is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal dominant condition characterizedby intellectual disability (ID), multiple congenital anomalies and a recognizable facial gestalt. Case presentation: The 3 year old girl showed moderate ID, aggressive behaviourand dysmorphisms, including hypertelorism, long palpebral ï¬ssures, eyebrows with sparse lateral third, and shortcolumella, resembling KS patients. ArrayCGH identi ï¬ed a 40.76 Mb pathogenic duplication at 1p13.3q21.2 pericen tromeric region and a 4.69 Mb duplication of unclear clinical signi ï¬cance at 10q22.2q22.3, both with pro ï¬les suggesting mosaicism. Subsequent karyotype and FISH analyses revealed a supernumerary ring chromosome in40% of the cells that co hybridizes with probes for both chromosome 1 and 10 duplicated regions. Discussion: sSMC derived from chromosome 1 can present a variable phenotype, ranging from normality to severe intellectual disability. However, the region 1p12 to 1q12 appears to be non dosage dependant and the size ofthe sSMC seems to correlate with the severity of the phenotype. The resemblance with KS was interest i n g l yr e p o r t e d2 0y e a r sa g oi nap a t i e n tp r e s e n t i n ga n interstitial duplica tion of the short arm of chromosome 1, in a locus with signi ï¬cant overlap with ours.

We report a Japanese female patient with tetrasomy 21 due to an extra chromosome derived from chromosome 21. Materials and Methods: Chromosome, ï¬uorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses for the patient, and SNP array based gen otyping for the trio were carried out. Results: The patient had severe psychomotor retardation without Down syndrome (DS) phenotype; she showed shortstature, microcephaly, round face and some dysmorphic features. At eight years old, she could not speak any meaningful words nor walk. The developmental quotientsscore was below 20. The chromosome analyses detected an extra dicentric chromosome 21, and revealed her karyotype1526to be 47,XX, +dic(21;21). FISH results were consistent with the karyotype. Allelic ratios of heterozygous SNPs indi cated the maternal origin of the extra chromosome 21. Copy number and structural variant analyses using WGS data indicated that the distal breakpoint of the dicentric chro mosome 21 is located within 21q21, and that the extrachromosome 21 doesn ât simply consist of inverted dupli cations of pter âq21.3region but contain multiple partial deletions, duplications, and inversions within it. Conclusions: The patient âlack of DS phenotype turned out to be due to the normal copy number of DS critical region (21q22.2 22.3). We will present the genomic orga nization of the tetrasomic region being further assessed by FISH and WGS data, and discuss possible molecular mechanisms that lead to the complex genomic rearrange ments in the patient.

Using triowhole exome sequencing (WES), we identi ï¬ed two new patients with intellectual disability (ID) carrying biallelic variants in TRAPPC11 . Patient 1: Pregnancy was marked by agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). At 4 years old, he presented neurode velopemental delay, progressive microcephaly ( 4SD) andsmall stature ( 2.5SD). Immune screening showed hypo gammaglobulinemia, causing multiple infections. CK level was normal. Postnatal brain MRI showed global cerebralatrophy and thin corpus callosum. He carried compound heterozygous splicing variants c.965 +5G>T/c.1287 +5G>A inTRAPPC11 inherited from both parents. Patient 2: Pregnancy was marked by IUGR.

After Rasmussen syndrome was mentioned in 2002 for the ï¬rst time, Feenstra et al . reported of families with deletion or mutations in TSHZ1 causing congenital aural atresia (CAA), in 2011. Here, we describe for the ï¬rst time a family with vertical talus (VT) and mutation only affecting TSHZ1 . We report on a family with an eleven year old boy, who was born at term after uneventful pregnancy. The boy had CAA and VT. He had mild intellectual disability and facial features including epicanthus, hypertelorism and broadnasal root. The mother of non consanguineous parents had learning dif ï¬culties as well as CAA and VT. The grand father had CAA like several members of the family of themother, too. In addition, the daughter of one cousin had CAA and VT. In suspicion of Rasmussen syndrome a targeted sequen cing analysis of TSHZ1 identi ï¬ed a heterozygous frameshift mutation c.718delA;p.

30708,"1INSERM UMR_1163 Imagine Institute, Paris, France, 2University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States Introduction: Recently, we reported heterozygous muta tions affecting Arg391 in the Î² tubulin 4B isotype encoding gene (TUBB4B) dampening the dynamics of growingmicrotubules (MT) in a distinctive neurosensorineural disorder (early onset and severe retinal dystrophy and sensorineural hearing loss). Despite abnormal MTdynamics, patient ï¬broblasts and cells overexpressing the mutant proteins displayed apparently normal ciliation and trafï¬cking. Here, we report the identi ï¬cation of a novel TUBB4B mutation in a sporadic case displaying blindness, sensorineural hearing loss, short stature, chronic kidney disease and recurrent sinus and ear infections, a constella tion of symptoms strongly reminiscent of ciliopathies. Consistent with this phenotype, we show that the mutation which affects Pro358 have a dramatic effect on ciliation. Material and Methods: Cilia from nasal brushing of the index cases were analyzed by TEM. The dynamics of MTgrowth and ciliation were analyzed in cultured cells over expressing FLAG tagged wild type or mutant TUBB4B . Results: Cilia from nasal brushing of the index case revealed ultrastructural abnormalities with rare axonemes and disorganized basal bodies. Inspection of the Î² tubulin atomic structure revealed that the Pro358 residue is locatedin a binding domain necessary for the dynamics of micro tubules. Functional analysis in cultured cells overexpressing FLAG tagged wild type or mutant TUBB4B showed thatthe mutant TUBB4B have a drastic impact on microtubule growth with no lattice as well as on ciliogenesis with absent cilia in the vast majority of cells. Conclusion: This study shows that TUBB4B mutations can cause a sensorineural disease or a multisystemic cilio pathy, depending on the localization of the alteration. S. Mechaussier: None. J.

The four core clinical features include congenital diarrhea, cholestasis, bone fragility, deafness, associated to learning disability. Material and Methods: We report two novel cases of O2HE diagnosed by trio WES, enlarging the clinical spectrum by the presence of malformations. Results: In patient 1 (20 years), severe congenital diar rhea due to microvilli atrophy was diagnosed at week 1,requiring long term hospitalization with exclusive enteral nutrition. Diarrhea became intermittent until age 10 and then stopped. Chronic pruritus caused by congenital cho lestasis was diagnosed in childhood. He was blind due to right anophthalmia, Peters anomaly with left pyramidal cataract, had severe sensorineural deafness, severe intel lectual disability with behavioral disorder, had 2 fractures after minimal injury. Trio WES revealed a paternally inherited UNC45A c.1407delinsGCA variant and a mater nally inherited c.2467G>C variant; and a de novo PBRM1 VUS (c.1301G>A). In patient 2 (3 weeks), cleft palate and severe diarrhea was diagnosed at day 1, with ï¬attening of brush border, requiring total parenteral nutrition. No cho lestasis was diagnosed, and testing of the audition is plan ned. Rapid trio exome revealed a maternally inheritedc.721C>T;p.(Arg241*) UNC45A variant and paternally inherited c.2182G>A variant. Conclusion: Further cases will be needed in order to better describe the phenotypic spectrum of UNC45A , and particularly the level of the neurocognitive phenotype, and the associated congenital malformation spectrum.

Selected patients and parents (mostly as trios or quartet) are studied by high coverage (150x) WES. From June 2016 to December 2018,twelve national pediatric centers have presented 503 undiagnosed families. Fifty two have been considered low priority since outside inclusion criteria (i.e. severity,pediatric age, complexity). Of the 451 enrolled families, 196 have completed the entire diagnostic NGS work ï¬ow andï¬nal result has been provided.

Initial non availability ofunrelated patients is therefore likely. To still enable the molecular classi ï¬cation of such cases, several types of information need to be considered. Materials and Methods: Two reportedly related indivi duals with a distinct syndromic phenotype were investi gated. Following negative chromosomal microarray andexome sequencing in the proband, patients were subjected to whole genome sequencing. The variants from the duo were analysed in a comparative manner, and used to esti mate the degree of relatedness. Results: The major clinical ï¬ndings in both patients overlapped; they included neurodevelopmental de ï¬cit, skeletal abnormalities and distinctive facial features. Variant ï¬ltering demonstrated a single unique shared homozygous high impact variant, c.178G>T (p. Glu60*), in VPS26C . Variation databases do not list individuals with bi allelic truncating variants in this gene, which codes for a protein involved in membrane protein recycling. Detailed geneal ogy analysis suggested close relationship for the patients â fathers, but very distant relationship for the mothers. An overall low degree of relatedness of the two patients, asconï¬rmed by comparative analysis of the genomes, implies a low likelihood for the genotype phenotype association to be a chance observation. Conclusion: Based on the genealogical information, clinical ï¬ndings, and comprehensive consideration of thegenetic data, we propose VPS26C as a novel disease gene in humans. Consistent with widespread expression of VPS26C and with the fundamental biological function of the encoded protein, its bi allelic inactivation causes a wide range of symptoms involving multiple organs.

Materials and Methods: A 31 y.o. pregnant woman with mild symptoms of Waardenburg Syndrome (WS) and a 35 y.o. woman with absence of the uterus were tested. Clinical exome sequencing was performed using Sophia Genetics â Clinical Exome Solution v2, which includes 4,493 genes. Following preparations according to the manufacturer âs protocol, DNA libraries were sequenced on an IlluminaNextSeq 500 genetic analyzer. Data processing, variant calling and CNV analysis were conducted by SOPHiA DDM Â®bioinformatics pipelines. Results: The analyses revealed a PAX3 gene deletion, conï¬rming WS in the ï¬rst patient and a duplication, including at least SCARF2, SERPIND1, SNAP29 andCRKL genes , consistent with Mayer Rokitanski Kuster Hauser syndrome, in the second patient. Both CNVs were ascer tained and their exact size determined ( â725kb and â1.05Mb respectively) by arrCGH. Discussion: Until recently, exome sequencing rose the diagnostic yield of genomic investigations by revealingSNV/INDEL disease causing variants. The design and analysis pipelines of the exome sequencing we implement empowers CNV detection as well.

30713,"University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary Introduction: WAGR syndrome (Wilms âtumor, aniridia, genitourinary malformations and impaired mental develop ment) is associated with deletions of chromosomal region11p13. Recently, some evidence accumulated on micro deletions within 11p13 with varying clinical manifestations. We report two such cases, and tentatively outline possiblegenotype phenotype associations in the region. Patients and Methods: Ourï¬rst case featured normal intellectual ability, pseudohermaphroditism, acute lympho blastic leukemia, Wilms tumor, glomerulonephritis and cerebellar angioblastoma. The second patient had complex genitourinary malformations, global developmental delayand mental de ï¬cit. RT PCR was used to detect gene copy numbers in the 11p13 region in both cases. FISH and a dPCR based analysis were performed in case 2. Results: In patient 1, a heterozygous deletion was found affecting the whole WT1 gene but neither one of the ï¬anking genes. In patient 2, a microdeletion was seen in the 11p13 region affecting only WT1 and EIF3M. In this case, we also detected a deletion at 22q13. Conclusions: While WAGR syndrome is generally con sidered as a single clinical entity caused by a relatively large deletion, the seemingly high frequency of microdeletions in the area (as seen in our cases and various anecdotal reportsin the literature) suggests that it may represent a spectrum of clinical features, the observed phenotype depending on which genes happen to be deleted. WT1 seems to beresponsible for genitourinary tumors and malformations, while in cases featuring a PAX6 or BDNF deletion, we may observe aniridia or obesity, respectively. Genes PRRG4 andSLC1A2 are likely candidates for causing intellectual de ï¬cit when deleted. G. BuglyÃ³: None. S. BirÃ³: None. K. Szakszon: None. J. MÃ¡tyus: None. G. MÃ©hes: None. G. Vargha: None.

He was admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit because ofgrowth failure, recurrent infections with sepsis and dehydration, hypogammaglobulinemia, absence of B lym phocytes, reduced NK cells, ichthyosis, hepatosplenome galy and facial dysmorphism (proptosis, thin lips, loose skin and reduced subcutaneous fat). At a ï¬rst glance, clinical presentation made us think about a syndromic immuno dysregulation; we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) which identi ï¬ed a biallelic variant in NBAS . Neuroblastoma ampli ï¬ed sequence (NBAS) gene encodes a protein highly expressed in connective tissue, eye, brain and spinal cord, and it is involved in nonsense mediated mRNA decay. Mutations in NBAS cause disregulation ofgenes involved in instruction of in ï¬ammatory response. Biallelic mutations in this gene have been associated with phenotypic spectrum that ranges from isolated acute liverfailure in infancy to a multisystemic condition including short stature, optic nerve atrophy and Pelger Huet (PH) anomaly of granulocytes (SOPH). Moreover, biallelicvariants were reported recently in two unrelated patients with characteristic facial appearance, PH anomaly and severe hypogammaglobulinemia with frequent infections. Clinical exome sequencing uncovers monogenic disorders in a signi ï¬cant number of infants in NICU when suspected to have genetic disorders, signi ï¬cantly in ï¬uencing the medical care.

Malmgren Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet and Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska Univ Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Whole exome (WES) or whole genome (WGS) sequencing in trios is becoming a common molecular diagnostic tool foranalysis of rare genetic disorders. At Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, clinical trio analysis has increased tenfold from 2012 2018. In total, trio analysis has been ï¬nalized for 503 patients with undiagnosed, suspected rare genetic condi tions. Data was analyzed for sequence variants in the codingpart or splice regions of the OMIM genes that were con sistent with Mendelian inheritance. In general CGH array and FRAXA analyses had been performed on the patientsprior to trio analysis. Of the 503 cases, the molecular diagnosis rate was 33%. De novo heterozygote sequence variants were the most prevalent causes of genetic disorder, 55%. Sequence var iants consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance were detected in 32% and X linked recessive inheritance in 8%of the cases. In eight cases, an autosomal dominant inher ited sequence variant was identi ï¬ed explained by a known dominant trait or variable expressivity. Most patients werereferred regarding intellectual disability and/or a syndromic phenotype. The different detected genetic diagnoses are rare, and for most cases the genetic outcome could not havebeen predicted. In conclusion, trio analysis in families with an unknown rare disorder has proven to be a valuable tool to obtain agenetic diagnosis. The identi ï¬cation of the genetic aberra tion in these patients is crucial for estimation of recurrence risk. It is also a pre requisite for carrier testing, prenatal orpreimplantation diagnostics.

30717,"Subdivision of Pediatric Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Izmir,Turkey Aim: Whole exome sequencing (WES) is being used increasingly to diagnose rare complex diseases. The purpose of this study is to determine the contribution of reverse phenotyping in diagnosing diseases with blendedphenotypes. Method: A 22 month old girl was referred to our clinic with developmental delay, hypotonia, convulsion andvomiting. She was the ï¬rst child of consanguineous parents. On physical examination she had growth retardation, hypotonia and dysmorphic facial features. Her laboratorytests were normal. A brain MRI revealed a white matter hypomyelination. Result: A speci ï¬c diagnosis could not be established via clinical features and laboratory tests, however WES revealed homozygous mutations in three different genes. The variant c.3412_3418del (p. Val1138Metfs*25) inCNTNAP1 gene has been classi ï¬ed as likely pathogenic, c.1090G>A (p. Val364Met) variant in DPYS gene classi ï¬ed as a variant of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VOUS), and c.2480G>A (p. Arg827Gln), in ATP7B gene classi ï¬ed as a VOUS in accordance with ACMG 2015 criteria. The par ents were found to be heterozygous for the same mutations. Disscussion: Following WES results, clinical compat ibility was investigated. Developmental delay and hypo myelination in the patient were suggestive of CongenitalHypomiyelinating Neuropathy caused by CNTNAP1 muta tions. Persistent vomiting is a symptom of Dihy dropriminidase de ï¬ciency caused by DPYS mutations. A decreased level of ceruloplasmin in the patient is considered as the ï¬rst sign of Wilson's disease caused by ATP7B mutations. Conclusion: Reverse phenotyping using WES shortens the diagnostic process, identi ï¬es the additional diseases in patients with blended phenotypes and improves the qualityof genetic counseling. D.

30718,"1University of Udine, Udine, Italy,2University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy,3Academic Hospital âAzienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata di Udine â, Udine, Italy Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1/7500 live births resulting from a hemizygous deletion of 28 genes on chromosome 7q11.23. This condition is characterized by mild tomoderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and cardiovascular problems. Moreover, WS subjectsfrequently suffer of several endocrine abnormalities includ ing hypothyroidism, idiopathic hypercalcemia, early pub erty, impaired glucose tolerance. Full hypothyroidismoccurs in about 10% of WS subjects; however, subclinical hypothyroidism occurs in about 30% of patients. Several data indicate that the hypothyroidism is due to thyroidmorphology defects: thyroid hypoplasia has been found in a large fraction of WS patients suffering of full or subclinical hypothyroidism. Several genes involved in thyroid dysgen esis have been identi ï¬ed; however, none of them is in the 7q11.23 region. Thus, the hypothyroidism molecular bases in WS are not known. By a microarray approach weanalyzed the expression levels of 7q11.23 region genes in embryo mice and selected those expressed also in thyroid or involved in its development. Among them, BAZ1B, amember of bromodomain protein family, appeared particu larly relevant. Silencing, by RNA interference, BAZ1B in a normal thyroid cell line (Nthy ori 3.1) and in two anaplasticthyroid cancer derived cell line (SW1736 and 8505C), we observed a signi ï¬cant cell viability reduction (about 50% in both cell lines), demonstrating the importance of BAZ1Bfor thyroid cell proliferation. These results demonstrate the relevance of BAZ1B loss in thyroid cells proliferation, suggesting a correlation between its deletion and thyroidhypoplasia in WS. L. Allegri: None. F. Baldan: None. C.

It is a transcription factor involved in lung, diaphragm and cardiac development regulating the GATAfamily proteins. Three distinct phenotypic entities related to ZFPM2 have been described: disorders of sex development, non syndromic diaphragmatic hernia and congenitalcardiopathies. Material and Methods: We report on a patient present ing with major facial features associated with a poly malformative syndrome and a novel truncating ZFPM2 variant. Results: This 31 year old patient presented at birth with diaphragmatic anterior eventration, pulmonary stenosis and right ventricular hypertrophy. He also had growth de ï¬ ciency, micropenis, cryptorchidism and a shawl scrotum. He had a coarse face, hypertelorism, anteverted nares, a long philtrum, macrostomia, gingival hyperplasia and teeth agenesis. He was in a school for special needs, but intel lectual de ï¬ciency was ruled out. He developed a dilatation of the ascending aorta in adulthood. Multiple investigations were normal. Exome sequencing revealed a frameshiftinsertion in ZFPM2 (c.621delA; p. Ala208Leufs*5), not inherited from the father (mother not available). Conclusion: The patient presents a peculiar association of malformations that belong to the ZFPM2 spectrum, but usually in a non syndromic context.

The aim of the work was to investigate mutational pro ï¬le of AML patients without known chromosomal translocations regard ing to immunophenotype data and clinical features. Patients and Methods: The 34 patients from Uzbekistan with AML without known recurrent chromosomal aberra tions were investigated (18 boys and 16 girls, mean age 10.6 years). The coding regions of 26 genes involved in thepathogenesis of AML were captured with SeqCap EZ Target Enrichment System (NimbleGen, Roche) and sequenced using Illumina âs MiniSeq platform. The muta tions were veri ï¬ed using Sanger sequencing. Results: Most patients (20 from 34) had one or more non synonymous mutations. One patient with M4 variant hadbiallelic CEBPA mutation, two patients had previously undescribed ETV6 mutations. Also, known somatic muta tions were revealed in the following genes: NPM1 (8.8%),JAK2 (5.9%), IDH1 (5.9%), NRAS (8.8%). In addition, rare germline variants with minor allele frequency less than 1% were found in CUX1, FLT3, TET2, PTPN11 and NUP98genes, that may indicate their role in genetic susceptibility to pediatric leukemia.

Imidazoacridinone C 1311 (Symadex â¢) is a new inhibitor of topoisomerase II and receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 that has been tested inphase II studies against metastatic breast cancer. Here, we assessed the effect of C 1311 on the miRNA and mRNA integrated pro ï¬les of prostate cancer cells with different expression of androgen receptor (AR). Materials and Methods: Prostate cancer cells were exposed to C 1311 for 24h. The miRNA and mRNAexpression pro ï¬les (adj. p < 0.05 and log fold change > 1) were generated from total RNA using nCounter Nanostring platform and RNA seq using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform,respectively. MiRNA mRNA expression pairing and path ways analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Results: Paired genomic analysis identi ï¬ed a total of 33 miRNA mRNA pairs in LNCaP (AR +) and 65 miRNA mRNA pairs in DU 145 (AR ) cells.

Thefrequency remains unknown in patients with milder phenotypes. Materials and Methods: The APC gene was sequenced in DNA isolated from 4 adenomas in a cohort of polyposis patients (n ,120) using Next Generation Sequencing. Patients were considered mosaic if an identical mutationwas identi ï¬ed in all lesions. Detection rates were compared between subgroups according to the number of adenomas. Clinical characteristics were compared between those withand those without a mosaic mutation. Results: The mosaicism detection rate was 18% in the whole cohort (22/120), 0% in patients with <10 adenomas(0/18), 9% in those with 10 20 adenomas (3/34) and 12% in patients over age 70 (2/17). Some patients were found to have an identical variant in only a subset of adenomas(n,21) and were called hybrid cases. Mean age of diag nosis was comparable in hybrid and non mosaic cases (both 62 years) and lower in pur e mosaic cases (50 years). Number of adenomas was also comparable between hybrid and non mosaic cases (n ,22 versus n ,18) and higher in mosaic cases (n ,38) Conclusions: Our results indicate that mosaic APC mutations also play a role in patients with less than 20 adenomas and/or older age at presentation.

30724,"Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common type of neoplasia in women and rapamycin analogues are frequently used in current treatment protocols. The limitations of the use of rapamycin in therapy includethe activation of the PI3K si gnaling pathway by other signaling pathways and reactiv ation via feedback regula tion. AZD3463 is an anticancer agent used as a potentialALK/IGF1R inhibitor and it has been determined that ALK inhibitors induce PI3K/AKT/mTOR mediated apop tosis and autophagy. In this study we investigated thein vitro effect of the rapamycin AZD3463 combination on breast cancer by providing lateral inhibition of PI3K signaling pathway.

Worldwide, 40 different missense variants were identi ï¬ed, but only 9 were classi ï¬ed as likely pathogenic upon modi ï¬ed ACMG criteria (higher weight for phenotypical evidence for rare tumors). BAP1 gene being a tumor suppressor, genetic inactivation leads to loss of nuclear expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC).The frequency of inactivation by two somatic genetic events varies upon tumor types; therefore, the speci ï¬city of BAP1 loss of staining to indicate a germline BAP1 mutation (positive predictive value, PPV) varies also. In the present study, we performed 217 BAP1 IHC (145 of them in cutaneous melanocytic tumors) in 118 members of102 families, analyzed in parallel for BAP1 germline muta tions to address the interest of BAP1 IHC to the BAP1 TPDS diagnostic. Given the variable PPV upon tumor types, only results of the 28 families with at least BAP1 IHC for two independent tumors are presented in the table below: Number of tumors with BAP1 lossNumber of tested tumorsNumber of familiesBAP1 genetic test results 1 2 to 7 7 6 wild type 1 class 3variant (VUS) 2 2 9 8 class 5 variants (deleterious)1 wild type More than 2 3 to 21 12 9 class 5 variants (deleterious)3 class 3 variants (VUS) In conclusion, we propose that the presence of two lesions with BAP1 expression loss in a family (same or different patients) be considered as a Pathogenic Moderate criterion to classify BAP1 variants under ACMG criteria.

Most patients show clinical bene ï¬t from the drug but a small subset shows intrinsic resistance (IR) and progresses on treatment. We report for the ï¬rst time molecular mechanisms of IR in 4 aggressive BCCcases. Using whole exome sequencing, analysis of copy number aberrations and transcriptional pro ï¬ling we were able to uncover the major determinants of IR in the studiedsamples. Our results show that these BCCs harbor either molecular signature earlier reported in BCCs with acquired resistance to vismodegib, such as p. W535L SMO mutationand ampli ï¬cation of GLI2; or bear molecular signature compatible with squamous cell carcinoma evolution (muta tions and focal copy number alterations of MYC, LGR4 andTCF7L1). In line with the detected driver events at DNA level upregulation of target genes of either Hh or WNT1538pathway was con ï¬rmed with RNA sequencing. Addition ally we report that all the BCC IR cases overexpress TRAG3, SNORA42 and microRNA711, markers of poor prognosis and resistance to treatment which were previously identi ï¬ed in other types of cancer.

Materials and Methods: Tumour samples from 65 Bul garian patients, staged pTa, pT1, pT2, pT2a, pT2b, pT3 andpT4 were collected. Four genes ( AP1S1, FIGF, HDAC11, CDK9 ) that showed signi ï¬cant difference between invasive and non invasive bladder carcinoma in a previous poolanalyses were selected for individual validation by RT PCR analysis (Qiagen). CNVs of 30 uroepithelial neoplastic samples (CytoChip Oligo aCGH, 4x44K and In ï¬nium OncoArray 500K BeadChip, Illumina) were performed. Data was analyzed by BluefuseMulti software and Karyostudio. Results and discussion: The gene expression analysis revealed 4 12 fold change difference in the expression level between pT2 and pTa and pT1 tumors. The highest up regulation was shown for AP1S1 gene, involved in protein trafï¬cking by clathrin coated vesicles. Five LOH variants in two pT2 samples were determined: arr 6p12.1p11.1(55721511 58767335)x2hmz, arr (7q21.3(94372640 97676259), 7q22.1q22.2(99552168 104336782))x2hmz,arr (11q14.1q14.2(81417643 86071005), 17q25.1q25.3 (73593574 77382564))x2hmz. No chromosomal abbera tions were found only in two pTa samples. Genomic imbalances âlosses were mostly found for arr 6p21.32 (32453988 32538289)x0 and arr 9p21.3(20351075 22755025)x0.

Results: Cytogenetic abnormality was detected in 51% cases (1162/2270) [Adult: 60% (454/759); Pediatric: 47% (708/1511)]. Incidence of t(9;22); BCR ABL1 , t(1;19); TCF3 PBX1 and MLL translocations was 31%, 4% and 3% in adult B ALL while 6%, 7% and 3% in pediatric B ALL respectively. Translocation (12; 21): ETV6/RUNX1 was found in 13% pediatric cases. Trisomy 4, 10, 17 weredetected either as a sole or in combination with each other in 31% (462/1511) pediatric cases and 22% (165/759) adult cases. Chromosomal counting revealed hyperdiploidy andhypodiploidy in 25% and 5% pediatric cases; 12% and 6% in adult cases which was correlated with ï¬ow cytometry DNA index.

Nowadays, the screening of those genes iscommonly performed with expanded panel genes using massive parallel sequencing (MPS). This technology is more sensitive and improves the capacity for detection of mosaicevents. Very few cases of de novo mutations have been described in BRCA genes wit h only one constitutional mosaicism of BRCA1 mutation d emonstrated b y Friedman and coll. Here, we report the ï¬rst case of constitutional mosaicism of BRCA2 mutation in a 46 years old woman referred to genetic counselling for bifocal lobular breast cancer. Two sisters developed breast cancer at 74 and 58 years old. Any cancer wasn ât diagnosed in upper generation. We performgenetic testing of a large panel of breast cancer susceptibility genes by MPS on a blood sample. The c.4688G>A, p. (Trp1563*) BRCA2 mutation was detected in 23% of sequence reads (>500X depth coverage) suggesting mosaic condition. Mosaic rate was con ï¬rmed in other tissues as bladder cells and salivary sample. Higher rate w as found in capillary bulb. The analysis of the non cancerous breast tissue is in progress. Finally, this case suggests that, although rare, this event should be taken into account in the evaluation of high riskfamilies and it is probably underestimate. Two reasons should increase the number of cases reported: large screening performed by highly accurate MPS and enhancedBRCA testing (outside of the ful ï¬lled high risk selection criteria) because of targeted therapies.

Correct interpretation of these variants is challenging, but important for correct clinical management. The aim of this study was to determine the pathogenicity ofthe intronic BRCA1 c.5407 25T>A variant found in Norwegian and French families. Results: TheBRCA1 c.5407 25T>A variant was detected in 17 families with suspected hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (mean Manchester score 16.1). This is a rare variant with a reported frequency of 0.00001579 in non FinnishEuropean population in the gnomAD database. It was found in 1/370 anonymous Norwegian blood donors and 0/784 patients included in an in house diagnostic exome database. NGS based RNA sequencing of BRCA1 in blood revealed that the variant leads to skipping of exon 22 and frameshift1540predicting the truncated BRCA1 protein p.(Gly1803Glnf sTer11). This exon skipping was con ï¬rmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the BRCA1 mRNA booth in blood, breast and in ovarian tissue. However, sequencing of two c.5407 25T>A carriers heterozygous for a transcribed SNP (c.4837A>G), showed that a low amount of correctlyspliced transcript including exon 22 is generated from the c.5407 25T>A allele. Western blot analysis of transiently expressed BRCA1 proteins in HeLa cells showed a reducedamount of the mutant p. Gly1803GlnfsTer11 compared to wild type protein. Conclusion: Our results indicate that BRCA1 c.5407 25T>A is a likely pathogenic splice variant associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. H. HÃ¸berg Vetti: None. E. Ognedal: None. A.

Methods: Record review of g BRCA carriers (excluding women with risk reduction mastectomy), diagnosed with breast cancer between 1/2005 4/2016. We compared out comes between carriers whose g BRCA was identi ï¬ed pre breast cancer (PRE C D) vs. post breast cancer (POST C D) diagnosis.

Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to esti mate the prevalence of pathogenic mutations in the ânewâ breast cancer susceptibility genes in a Greek patients â cohort. Patients and Methods: 104 women who developed breast cancer under the age of 55 years old with or without family history and women free of cancer but with two or more affected ï¬rst degree relatives constitute our patients â cohort. DNA was extracted with Nucleospin tissue kit and libraries were prepared using the TruSight Â®Cancer Sequencing Panel, which includes 40 breast cancer sus ceptibility genes, following the manufacturer âs instructions. Massive parallel sequencing was conducted on Miseq platform (Illumina). Results: Two cases carrying missense mutations of unknown clinical signi ï¬cance were identi ï¬ed in MLH1 and PALB2 genes, respectively. One case harbors the CHEK2 c.1100delC mutation, which confers three to ï¬ve fold increased risk compared to the general population, whiletwo women were heterozygote for pathogenic mutation in theRAD51C andRAD51D genes, respectively. Conclusion: The overall occurrence of possibly patho genic mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes, excluding the ones detected in the highly penetrant BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is 4.8%.

Twin studies estimate that >30% BCs are the result of hereditary factors. While hugely informative,pathogenic variants in BRCA1 andBRCA2 explain only 16 22% of hereditary BCs. Several high and moderate risk genes, and >100 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)have been identi ï¬ed which explain 33% of hereditary BCs. Approximately 50% of the hereditary risk of BC is unknown. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a cost effective method of investigating numerous genes in one assay. There are an abundance of clinical multi gene panel tests aimed at assessing the inherited risk of BC Â± ovariancancer. This study aimed to investigate germline variants genes included on breast Â± ovarian cancer risk panels in an Irish population. DNA from 90 BCs and 77 controls weresequenced for variants in 83 genes from clinical breast Â± ovarian cancer risk panels. Variant calling was performed following GATK best practices, and prioritised as loss of function(LOF) and missense variants; further grading was performed using ï¬vein silico prediction tools.

Of 11 sisters, 5 were diagnosed with breast cancer in their 60 âs; one had both papillary thyroid cancer (age 67) and pancreatic cancer (age 76). Their mother had breast cancer (age 70). Panel testing in four sisters revealed two germline variants: a known pathogenic mutation in ATM p. Q1970X; and a variant in CHEK2 classi ï¬ed as being of uncertain signi ï¬cance c.592 +3A>T. (rs587782849, gno mAD allele frequency ,0.000032). This variant has been reported once to alter CHEK2 splicing (Kraus C et al, Int J Cancer, 2017). 8 sisters were tested. Of the 5 with breast cancer, 3 (ages 60 66) carried of both variants and two (ages61, 67) carried only the CHEK2 variant. The sister affected with thyroid and pancreatic cancer carried only the ATM mutation, as did 2 unaffected sisters (ages 53, 67). CHEK2c.592+3A>T was found in 2/234 (0.8%) Sephardi breast cancer patients (also of Moroccan origin), and was also observed in an unaffected woman of Balkan origin (age 36).cDNA analysis revealed two alternate transcripts, one lacking exon 4, and one lacking exons 4 5 (both out of frame, con ï¬rming the previous report). Semi quantitative PCR indicated 50% reduction of the wild type transcript. In summary, CHEK2 c.592 +3 A>T is a rare splicing variant, which should be reclassi ï¬ed as mild pathogenic. In this family, the presence of two pathogenic variants in moderate risk breast cancer genes may explain the high load of late onset breast cancer. M. Barzily Rokni: None. R. Michaelson Cohen: None.

Theaim of our study was to search for possible predictive biomarkers for patient strati ï¬cation to ensure maximum treatment ef ï¬cacy of TRAIL targeted therapy. Materials and Methods: 88 breast cancer tissues were examined for relative mRNA expression of TRAIL and its receptors ( DR4, DR5, DcR1, DcR2 ), using RT PCR/ ÎÎCt method. For statistical analysis SPSSv22 package was used. Death receptor (DR4, DR5) protein levels were analyzed by Western blot in a subset of cases. Results: Elevated mRNA levels were observed in 11%, 19.3%, 23.9%, 11.6% and 12% of the cases for TRAIL, DR4, DR5, DcR1 and DcR2 genes respectively. Reduced mRNA levels were detected in 64.6%, 38.6%, 31.8%, 45.3% and 42.2% of the cases for TRAIL, DR4, DR5, DcR1 , andDcR2 genes respectively. TRAIL expression was cor related with molecular subtype (p ,0,011), DR4 with N category (p ,0,029) and tumor grade (p ,0,015), DcR1 with tumor grade (p ,0,001) and ER/PR expression (p ,0,051). All receptors correlated with the prognostic stage (DR4 p,0,005, DR5 p ,0,029, DcR1 and DcR2 p ,0,006). The receptors âmRNA levels presented linear correlations and the strongest was found between DR4/DR5 (R ,0,634, p<0,001). Conclusions: A signi ï¬cant deregulation of TRAIL pathway components mRNA expression in breast cancer was observed in the present study.

The integration of gene expression pro ï¬les and protein protein interaction (PPI) network provides abetter understanding of the molecular architecture of diseases. Recently, many researchers have invested efforts for identifying subnetwork biomarkers for cancer. It hasbeen shown that these subnetwork biomarkers are more robust and reliable than single biomarker genes that are selected based on the gene expression data only. Materials and Methods: We performed an integrated network analysis of gene expression data with the PPI to identify signi ï¬cant subnetwork biomarkers. In addition, we used the k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to de ï¬ne the classi ï¬er. We validated the classi ï¬cation performance on an independent gene expression dataset of breast cancer sam ples. Moreover, we performed survival analyses using dif ferent transcriptomic datasets that consisted of over 3,000 samples. Results: We have identi ï¬ed four subnetwork biomarkers that signi ï¬cantly distinguished breast cancer patients from healthy controls. The identi ï¬ed classi ï¬er achieved 97% predictive accuracy between tumor and normal samples. Moreover, the survival analysis demonstrated that high expression of our biomarkers is associated with poor diseaseoutcome. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the network ana lysis coupled with genomic data may provide a robustmethodology to identify key biological programs associated with breast cancer progression and invasion and may lead to1544improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic options.

30739,"P. James Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia Background: The genetic causes of a large proportion of breast cancer families is unknown and while our targeted sequencing of over 12,000 index cases and controls has identi ï¬ed numerous strong candidates, individually muta tions in these genes are rare. Our work highlights the fact that in isolation, case control studies will remain substan tially underpowered to establish a clear role for novel breastcancer predisposition genes and orthogonal validation approaches will be required. Genomic analysis of tumours from carriers of germline variants in candidate genes canprovide powerful additional evidence for involvement of a gene in cancer predisposition through identi ï¬cation of âsecond hit âsomatic inactivation events and characteristic âmutational signatures â. Results: We applied this approach to assess the role of RAD51C in breast cancer predisposition. Full exon sequencing of RAD51C in a case/control analysis identi ï¬ed a signi ï¬cant excess of loss of function variants in cases compared with controls (0.36% versus 0.04%; OR ,8.67, 95% CI ,1.89 to 80.52, P,9.87x10 04). In addition, the association was highly signi ï¬cant among cases with ER negative ( P,1.57x10 05) or triple negative cancer (P,7.33x10 06), but not in ER positive cases. Tumour sequencing from carriers con ï¬rmed bi allelic inactivation in all the triple negative cases and this was associated withhigh levels of large scale genomic alterations and a muta tional signature 3, both indicative of homologous recom bination repair de ï¬ciency. Conclusions: This study provides compelling evidence that germline loss of function variants in RAD51C are associated with triple negative breast cancer and demon strates the substantial power of tumour sequencing to advance the discover new cancer genes.

Up to date, more than 5000 distinct BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants have been reported, while their frequency and distribution varies between populations and ethnicities. In the Greek population, founder effects have been described, mainlyinvolving BRCA1 loss of function variants. However, certain geographical regions were underrepresented in previous studies. We therefore aimed to de ï¬ne and molecularly characterize the BRCA1/2 mutational spectrum in Crete, the largest Greek island with unique demographic and cultural characteristics. Materials and Methods: Patients of Cretan descent, with breast or/and ovarian cancer ful ï¬lling NCCN guidelines were selected for genetic testing by NGS or Sangersequencing, followed by MLPA. Haplotype analysis was subsequently performed to investigate potential founder effects of recurrent alleles. Results: In total 291 patients (273 females, 18 males) were included. Forty eight patients (16.5%) carried 21 dif ferent pathogenic variants in BRCA1 (45.8%; 22/48) and BRCA2 (54.2%; 26/48). The deleterious variants c.6842 2675_7008 5558del and c.7806 2A>T in BRCA2 and c.5492del in BRCA1 were recurrent and constituted 50% of all identi ï¬ed pathogenic variants. Haplotype analysis con ï¬rmed a founder effect for all three variants with a particular origin for each of them. Subsequent analyses indicate thatthese are Cretan founders, since they have not been detected in patients originating from other regions of Greece. Conclusions: The BRCA1/2 mutational spectrum of the Cretan population shows particular geographical distribu tion, in ï¬uenced by strong founder effects.

30741,"We had previously developed a methodology using allele speciï¬c expression (ASE) as a proxy to discovering Genes with Allelic Dysregulation (GADs) impacted by non codingsomatic mutations, which requires matched healthy tumour samples. Here, we describe a methodology to discover GADs using unmatched samples to compare tumor andreference RNAseq ASE (e,g. GTEx). Somatic mutations under selection for tumorigenesis and falling in non coding regulatory regions of a gene tend to affect transcription in anallelic fashion that is observed as altered allelic imbalance between normal and tumor samples. Moreover, we also expect this gene to have altered gene expression forselection to occur. Hence, to detect non coding regulatory drivers in tumorigenesis, discriminating genes under selection or under an eQTL effect, we devised three criteriato discover true driver genes. To test our method, we used colorectal cancer data from the SYSCOL project treating tumor and healthy samples as unmatched. We discov ered702 genes passing all ï¬ltering criteria. Of them, 197 overlapped with the 373 GADs previously discovered with matched samples. Next, we used SYSCOL tumor and GTExsamples as control from colon sigmoid and colon transverse, discovering 612 and 689 GADs, respectively. Of these, 480 genes overlapped among all three unmatchedanalyses passing all criteria with 152 overlapping with the previously discovered GADs indicating that our methodol ogy can detect regulatory drivers. Many of these havealready been implicated in various cancers. Current work is validating our approach using prostate adenocarcinoma samples and other cancers and exploring the understudiednon coding regulatory drivers. N. M.R. Lykoskou ï¬s:None. H.

To date, only few molecular signatures have been described and the etiology of the syndrome has not been identi ï¬ed in the vast majority of patients. To uncover causative variants, the exomes of 49 SPS patients have been sequenced (Illumina HiSeq) using leu kocyte DNA. For data analysis, the GATK and the Varbank2 software were used. The germline variants were ï¬ltered for rare (biallelic: MAF â¤1%, monoallelic: â¤0.1% according to gnomAD and an in house database) loss of function (LoF) variants. The pLi score and reactome path way analysis were used for further prioritization. Biallelic LoF variants were found in 3 genes none of which being recurrently mutated. All in all, 548 genes harbored heterozygous LoF variants. 25 genes were recur rently mutated. 31/551 genes were extremely LoF intolerant indicated by pLi score â¥0.9. 10/551 genes are involved in DNA repair, 12 in cell cycle checkpoint control, and onegene in programmed cell death. Most interestingly, different variants in two patients were found in one gene functioning in the canonical wnt signalling pathway, as does RNF43, inwhich pathogenic variants have been shown to be causal for SPS. Exome sequencing identi ï¬es potentially causative germ line variants underlying the susceptibility to SPS. The cur rent work up consists of screening of additional SPS patients for the most interesting genes, and the inclusion ofmissense variants as well as CNVs.

Postovit3 1University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada, 2Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States,3University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada Introduction: Through alternative start site usage and alternative splicing, individual genes commonly produce multiple mRNA isoforms that can code for proteins with similar, distinct, or even opposing functions. Most cancerexpression studies evaluate expression at a gene level, not accounting for the impact of multiple transcript isoforms arising from the same genetic locus. Materials and Methods: Herein, we used clinical and RNA sequencing data from 5642 tumours from 14 different cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas to investigateassociations between gene expression, at both the gene and isoform levels, and patient outcomes using Cox regression models. In addition, we used SNP and methylation data toanalyze how coordinated genetic and epigenetic events may regulate these alternative isoform decisions through appli cation of the sQTLseekeR algorithm and a methylationcorrelation analysis. Results: We have found that many genes have alternative isoforms that associate with survival in opposite directions,unveiling a new molecular level with strong associations with patient outcomes. Isoform level data, when compared to gene level data, revealed an additional 6605 genes withisoforms signi ï¬cantly associated with survival in the 14 different cancers studied (|meta Z score| Q<0.001). Addi tionally, we have identi ï¬ed potential genetic (SNP) and epigenetic (methylation) mechanisms for these alternative isoform decisions. Conclusions: We have shown that approaching gene expression as an isoform level phenomenon provides a more sensitive approach to identifying signatures associated with patient outcomes. Moreover, the genetic and epigeneticregulation of these events reveals speci ï¬c molecular biology that may contribute to individual differences in disease outcome, and should be further explored.

30743,"1University Hospital of North Norway, TromsÃ¸, Norway, 2The Arctic University of Norway, TromsÃ¸, Norway Introduction: Patients with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) are diagnostically tested for pathogenicvariants (PVs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 . However, in most HBOC families no PVs are detected. Currently, several additional genes were shown to be involved in increasingthe cancer risk in HBOC patients. Accordingly, we investigated a Norwegian HBOC cohort in order to identify genetic risk factors for cancer in these patients. Material and Methods: Hundred and one HBOC patients negative for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/BRCA2 were screened for PVs in 94 genes using next generationsequencing. We used Illumina TruSight rapid capture technology to prepare the Illumina TruSight Cancer targeted sequencing libraries, which were sequenced using an Illu mina MiSeq System. The sequencing data were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq Reporter, and detected variants were annotated and ï¬ltered in Cartagenia Bench Lab NGS soft ware using different criteria. The detected variants were scrutinized for their pathogenicity using Alamut Visual (Interactive Biosoftware). Results: Nine different deleterious germline PV/likely pathogenic variants were identi ï¬ed in seven genes in 12 patients: three in ATM , and one in CHEK2, ERCC5 , FANCM ,RAD51C ,TP53 andWRN . Six of the 12 patients were carriers of a variant of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUSs) in other genes. Several different VUSs were identi ï¬ed requiring further characterization. Conclusion: In order to improve the clinical follow up, more knowledge is needed regarding the diversity ofgenetic risk factors possibly involved in cancer develop ment.

Therefore, genomic analysis of cancer cells has greatly enhanced our ability to identify genetic alterations associated with various cancer types. Taking this in mind, cancer diagnosis and treatment is undergoing a fundamental shift from a histopathologically deï¬ned tumour treated with chemotherapy towards mole cular characterisation of the tumour and use of targeted therapies. The challenge of clinical centres is to meet the needs for molecular testing using reliable methods andprocesses to ensure the patient receives accurate results in a timely manner. This study is focusing on the identi ï¬cation of actionable mutations in non small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) patients that could inform the clinician in regards to diagnosis, prognosis and therapy decision. Materials and Methods: Formalin ï¬xed, paraf ï¬n embedded (FFPE) tumour DNA from 57 patients diag nosed with NSCLC were subjected to NIPD Genetics pro prietary targeted capture enrichment technology followedby NGS. Sequencing data were validated by an independent laboratory using Ion Torrent platform and Ampliseq colon and lung cancer panel from Thermo ï¬sher. Results: The most frequent mutations were identi ï¬ed in TP53 (46.81%), KRAS (14.89%), EGFR (10.64%) and PIK3CA (10.64%). Results were validated with IonTorrent NGS for 26 patients for which there was adequate DNA material from the same tissue sections with a 97.3% con cordance between the two methods. Conclusion: These results highlight the clinical utility of our assay as a companion diagnostics tool that can inform cancer diagnosis, prognosis and guide therapy. S. Kyriakou: None. A. Eliades: A.

Comparative analyses between intervals were undertaken, including referral rates to CGU, investigations and patient outcomes. Family history taking in a sample of 20 patientsmanaged in each interval was assessed by retrospective chart review. Results: Frequency of family history taking, and referral to CGU, increased with each intervention, particularly, the virtual MDM (40% v 85%). Referral rates increased over the study period, from 0.1 referral/week (5/year, 0.36% totalreferrals) to 1.2/week (projected 63/year (3.81%). Forty four (52%) patients referred required germline testing, in three of whom variants were identi ï¬ed. Non attendance rates were low (6, 7%).

Recent data suggest that CRPC may carry the germline or sporadic mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genesand this cancer is commonly identi ï¬ed in families with a high predisposition to the breast and ovarian cancer. Next generation sequencing based studies can uncover thecomplex genomic landscape of CRPC and identify novel targets for ef ï¬cient anticancer therapies. The aim of our study was the assessment of DDR pathway alterations inLithuanian cohort of CRPC cases using qPCR and NGS targeted gene panel. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from leu kocytes of 143 CRPC patients that enrolled the study during 2016 2018. Dominant germline gene mutations in periph eral blood leukocytes were analyzed by custom madeTaqMan assays and by NGS using custom made panel. Results: DNA mutation in at least one of the ï¬ve DDR genes was detected in 23 of 143 (16%) CRPC cases: inBRCA1 ,BRCA2 ,CHEK2 ,NBN andATM were detected 2 (1,4%), 3 (2,1%), 12 (8,4%), 1 (0,7%) and 5 (3,5%), respectively. The most predominant mutation of the DDRpathway was the CHEK2 c.470T>C mutation. Conclusions: Germline or sporadic mutations of DDR pathway genes were detected in 16% of CRPC casesshowing signi ï¬cant involvement of this molecular pathway in progression of PCa to the most aggressive form of the disease. In the future, speci ï¬c treatment regimens should be considered for this subgroup of CRPC cases. R. Sabaliauskaite: None. I. Trockaja: None. A. Sesto kaite: None. A. Ulys: None. F.

Determination of CD24 expression in plasma, exosomes and ovarian tissue samples of serousovarian cancer patients was our aim. Ovarian tissue and blood samples from 21 cases of serous ovarian cancer and eight healthy controls were collected. After RNA isolation, the cDNA was synthesized, and then quantitative real time PCR was performed using beta globin as a housekeeping gene for the normalization of the data. Protein protein and miRNA network analysis were per formed using Biogrid and miRTargetLink databases. Signi ï¬cant difference in the expression of CD24 in ovarian tissue between controls and patients (0.1595 Â±0.3213 vs. 44.97Â±68.06 p ,0.0068) was observed, while CD24 expression was detected in exosomes in 38.1% ofpatients, mainly with FIGO III, and in plasma 9.5% of cases. Correlation in the expression of CD24 and FIGO stages was determined between controls and patients. Ournetwork analysis shows LYN, SELP, FGR, and NPM1 proteins are interacting with CD24.

In ourcohort, we identi ï¬ed 22 carriers of variants of uncertain signiï¬cance (VUS) in CHD1 , most with a low likelihood of pathogenicity. Conclusions: Testing for CDH1 variants in patients who do not ful ï¬ll the IGCLC criteria resulted in a small number of identi ï¬ed PV/LPV carriers. Due to incomplete family histories, these cannot be regarded as true incidental ï¬nd ings. The VUS detection rate was low. K. Strojnik: None. M. Krajc: None. M. Banjac: None. V. Stegel: None. P.

30748,"Germline mutations in the CDKN2A gene cause a hereditary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and melanoma syndrome. The presence of a CDKN2A pathogenic variant has a signi ï¬cant impact in determining appropriate screen ings in carriers. Thus, accurate variant interpretation for CDKN2A gene alterations is of utmost importance. There are con ï¬ icting reports of pathogenicity for a speci ï¬c variant (c.146T>C) in this gene. This variant has been classi ï¬ed as a non actionable variant of uncertain signi ï¬cance by four laboratories while one laboratory has classi ï¬ed it as likely pathogenic and thus clinically actionable. Of interest, this variant is present in the ExAC database at a high frequencyin the Latino population and, based on clinical data provided to laboratories, an association with this variant and PDAC in this population is postulated. We present four pedigrees with Latino ancestry and the CDKN2A c.146T>C variant. The pedigrees are consistent with a hereditary PDAC and melanoma syndrome. In two families, themutation was documented in probands with a personal and family history of PDAC. The third proband has a personal history of melanoma and four ï¬rst degree relatives and two second degree relatives with PDAC. The fourth proband is unaffected with a second degree relative with PDAC. These clinical histories will assist with de ï¬ning the pathogenicity of this variant. It is documented that surveillance is more successful at detecting PDAC at a resectable stage in CDKN2A mutation carriers and thus accurate classi ï¬cation of likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants plays an important role in determining appropriate surveillance in mutation carriers.

With the advent of next generation sequencing a few more susceptibility genes have been identi ï¬ed over the last decade. Yet, approximately 50% of familial melanoma cases have no known attributed genetic cause, despite suggested autosomal dominant inheritance of disease. Materials and Method: Whole genome (WGS) or exome (WES) sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 529 individuals in 267 high risk families with cuta neous or uveal melanoma. Results: WGS identi ï¬ed a 234 kb deletion approximately 200 kb upstream of the CDKN2A gene in 20/23 affected individuals from a large cutaneous melanoma family. In the neighbouring gene DMRTA1 , we identi ï¬ed a haplotype linked rare (gnomAD variant allele frequency ,8x1 0 5) coding variant. Screening of melanoma families worldwide identi ï¬ed a further eight families harbouring this deletion.1550Genetic ancestry analysis in combination with detailed examination of records revealed a shared ancestor for three of these families, though likely all originated from a com mon founder. Functional assessment of how this deletion modiï¬es risk of cutaneous melanoma is on going. Conclusions: The deletion upstream of CDKN2A is the most common mutation to have been found in cutaneous melanoma families. This ï¬nding is of further signi ï¬cance due to the distance of the deletion from CDKN2A and that it would not be detected using traditional exome screening. P. A. Johansson: None. V. Nathan: None.

Materials and Methods: 275 blood samples from NSCLC patients (73 with matched paraf ï¬n embedded tumor tissues) were examined for EGFR mutations. Circu lating cell free tumor DNA (cf DNA) isolation from plasma and detection of EGFR mutations was performed using Cobas Â®EGFR mutation test v2. Results: EGFR mutations in cf DNA were found in 22% of the samples. The most common EGFR mutations were exon 19 deletions (65%), followed by exon 21 pointmutations (30%). The presence of mutations in primary NSCLC reached 12% whereas the rate of mutations was 33% for NSCLC patients during follow up. A resistancemutation, p. Thr790Met was displayed in 27% of the mutant cases. The analysis of 73 plasma cf DNA samples versus matched tumor DNA showed 82% concordance with 62%sensitivity, 100% speci ï¬city, 100% PPV, 75% NPV, for the detection of EGFR mutations. Conclusions: We observed a very high Positive Pre dictive Value of cf DNA testing using Cobas Â®EGFR mutation test v2 indicating that EGFR mutations could be reported with certainty, whereas for patients with an EGFRmutation negative cfDNA test, a biopsy should be obtained in order to ascertain an accurate result, according to currentguidelines.

The aim of this work was to study CHEK2 mutations in hereditary cancer patients from Spain. In aï¬rst step, we analyzed the three most prevalent CHEK2 mutations in a hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cohort (HBOC). Next, we extended the analysis to the entire gene to a larger hereditary cancer cohort. Patients and Methods: Testing for recurrent CHEK2 mutations was performed by MLPA and CSCE in 432 patients from a retrospective HBOC cohort, negative forBRCA mutations. Targeted NGS was used to screen for CHEK2 point mutations and large rearrangements in a prospective cohort consisting in 1926 patients with heredi tary cancer suspicion. Results: In total we found 16 different mutations in 24 index cases (~1%); only one recurrent mutation,c.1100delC, was found in one case. Seventeen of these patients (71%) had breast cancer while the remaining seven were affected by other cancers (kidney, colorectal, ovarian,pancreatic and testicular cancers). Two of them were car riers of biallelic mutations, showing a severe phenotype. Conclusions: Most of the CHEK2 identi ï¬ed mutations are not the common european recurrent mutations and are present in patients outside the classical HBOC syndrome.

Although the morphology and immunologicalproï¬le of the chordoma cells are well described the molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for the chordomas development have not been suf ï¬ciently elucidated yet. Material and Methods: Total 45 FFPE chordoma sam ples from 20 patients from 2004 2017 were included in theproject. DNA isolation and Whole Genome Ampli ï¬cation (WGA) using RepliG (QIAGEN) and Picoplex (Rubicon Genomics) were performed (in every sample). Determina tion of chromosomal changes was performed using micro array technology (Sure Print G3 Unrestricted CGH (8x60K), Agilent) and massive parallel sequencing (Ver iSeq, lllumina). Results: DNA samples were of low quality and con centration. Even after RepliG WGA, hybridization on chipwas not successful. After Picoplex WGA, chromosomal changes were successfully determined using the VeriSeq kit in only 26 samples (from 17 patients). Recurrently foundchanges were 1p loss, 1q gain, chromosome 7 gain, chro mosome 14 and 18 losses. The found changes were con ï¬rmed using FISH. The resulting pro ï¬les did not change during the patients` disease progress. Conclusions: Our pilot study revealed that microarray is inappropriate method for studying chromosomal changes inFFPE chordoma samples. The chromosomal changes were detected in 85% of patients tested by VeriSeq kit. Ourï¬ndings corellate with published results, but clinical utility of these ï¬ndings has to be evaluated.

Mutations in DNA repair genes disruptproper cell maintenance, causing structural or copy number aberrations that lead to cancer susceptibility. Here we describe two reportedly unrelated patients that presentedwith unique cancer syndromes and an abnormal karyotype in peripheral blood lymphocytes, caused by homozygosity for the p. Gly167Arg mutation in CHEK2 . Materials and Methods: Patient 1 was genetically diagnosed by the TruSight One (TSO) panel and whole exome sequencing (WES); Patient 2 was diagnosed byFoundationOne Â®Heme genomic analysis. Candidate variant con ï¬rmation and segregation analyses were done with Sanger sequencing. Karyotype analysis was per formed on peripheral blood, bone marrow and other available tissues.1552Results: Patient 1 presented with multi organ tumor ogenesis, while Patient 2 had early onset acute myeloid leukemia. Both patients were found homozygous for the CHEK2 c.499G>A; p. Gly167Arg variant. Karyotype ana lysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed 30 60% multiple different chromosomal translocations. This kar yotype was not observed in other tested tissues, including bone marrow, nor in another cancer patient with a different homozygous missense mutation in CHEK2 (p. Ser428Phe). Conclusions: CHEK2 is a tumor suppressor gene, encoding the serine threonine kinase CHK2. Our ï¬ndings support the role of CHK2 in DNA repair, as highlighted bythe multiple chromosomal translocations observed in lym phocytes from both patients. We suggest that homozygosity for p. Gly167Arg impairs the correction of DNA breaks,leading to increased susceptibility to multiple tumorigenesis or early onset disease. T. Paperna: None. N. Sharon Shwartzman: None. A. Kurolap: None. Y.

However, the identi ï¬cation of the non coding regulatory regions and the genes mediating their effects, remains poorly understood. In a previous study (BioRxiv 174219), we identi ï¬ed 16 local modules of coordinated non âcoding regulatory elements of the genome (cis regulatory domains or CRDs, FDR 5%) that accumu lated an excess of somatic mutations in 150 patients withchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a cancer affecting B cells. Of those regions, 15 were associated to 44 genes, candidates drivers of tumorigenesis. In this work, we present the development of an in vitro cancer like model in which transformed B cells areevaluated for their ability to reproduce cancer phenotypes such as cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis. For 21 genes with increased expression due to hypermutated CRDs, we setup a transfection assay to overexpress the genes and evaluate the phenotypic changes. For 14 genes with observed decreased expression, a microRNA inter ference approach was designed to express arti ï¬cial miRNAs with high target cleavage. Challenges and limitations of this approach are the low percentage of B cells in blood and subject to donor dependent variability (3 15% of total PBMCs), and the difï¬culty of B cell transfection and culture. The identi ï¬cation of changes in transformed B cells towards a cancer like phenotype due to the expression changes of candidate genes will provide a functional vali dation for the computational approach used to identify hypermutated CRDs and it will potentially identify new genes driving tumorigenesis in CLL.

CLL features ahandful of putative driver genes and, more interestingly, a large number of non recurrently mutated genes with elusive clinical implications. The aim of this study was to unravelthe prognostic impact of pathway somatic mutation patterns in CLL. Materials and Methods: We focused on a cohort of 316 CLL patients de ï¬ned by mutated IGHV with somatic mutation data gathered by International Cancer Genome Consortium. In this cohort we collected 4739 genes affectedby nonsynonymous point and/or frameshift mutations. We performed gene set enrichment analysis to identify affectedAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1553biological pathways, applied set theory to reduce redun dancy in enriched gene sets, calculated pathway mutation scores for each patient and performed consensus clustering. Finally, we evaluated the difference in time to therapy (TTT) between identi ï¬ed CLL clusters. Results: We identi ï¬ed eight clusters differing in TTT (p<0.0001); seven of these were characterized by distinct affected biological processes: namely, cell adhesion (21/23 mutated cases in the cluster), membrane depolarization (27/32), synapse organization (18/22), glycosylation (19/25), Rho protein signal transduction (27/37), oxytocin signalling and/or renin secretion (26/40), and transport through ABCtransporters (11/20; patients with the earliest need for therapy). Conclusion: Among CLL patients with mutated IGHV we identi ï¬ed distinct subgroups with non recurrently mutated genes involved in a limited number of biological pathways.

Primary resistance to the targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is registered in up to 20%of patients. The aim of the work is to search for possible markers of the ef ï¬cacy of TKI therapy. We sequenced 60 exomes of patients with CML with different response totreatment on the platform NextSeq â¢550, Illumina. The microRNA expression pro ï¬le (n,6 with the optimal response, n ,6 with failure of therapy) was examined using Nanostring technology and nCountermiRNA Expression Assay. On an average, we found 280000 variants, which arecurrently under analysis. GWAS analysis using Hail did not reveal polymorphisms associated with the response to therapy. Based on the results of the expression analysis of 17 microRNAs with differential expression in two groups were selected (p <0.05). The greatest difference in expression is shown for hsa miR 4286. Analysis of thefunctional role of microRNA revealed 40 pathways enriched with genes regulated by 17 microRNAs. The most important pathway is Pathways in cancer (hsa05200, p , 9.5 * 10 14). The pathways Chronic myeloid leukemia (hsa05220, p ,0.00018), and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (hsa05221; p ,0.04) are also enriched.

Diagnosing CRC patients reliably at an early and curable stage is of utmostimportance to reduce the risk of mortality. Materials and Methods: We identi ï¬ed a blood based gene signature by performing an integrated genomic ana lysis of whole genome gene expression and copy number alteration of Saudi CRC patients. The identi ï¬ed gene sig nature was then validated using independent datasets ofgene expression pro ï¬ling of CRC patients. In addition, we validated the gene signature âs classi ï¬cation performance and the prognostic potential using TCGA (microarray andRNAseq) datasets with samples from over 800 CRCpatients with detailed clinical data. We also identi ï¬ed the signiï¬cantly altered pathways in CRC. Results: The results have demonstrated that high expression of our gene signature is signi ï¬cantly associated with poor disease outcome. The pathway analysis revealed alterations in various cancer related pathways essential forCRC transformation; hence validating our gene signature âs diagnostic and prognostic potential using patients âbiologi calï¬uids rather than invasive procedures.

Results: We identi ï¬ed 29 patients with germline muta tions in the MLH1 andMSH2 genes (17 and 12 patients, respectively). The detected variants were found throughout the coding part of the genes. Nine MLH1 mutations have been described for the ï¬rst time. The highest accuracy was1556shown for the ACI (85%). High level MSI and no BRAF mutation were found in all analyzed LS tumours. Conclusions: The results of our study prove that MSI approach provides a sensitivity of 100% for identifying LS patients. The ACII missed as many as 31% of LS cases. Being quite stringent the ACI showed a high rate of spe ciï¬city but failed to recognize 41% of LS patients. L. Lyubchenko: None. A. Semyanikhina: None. N. Pospekhova: None. D. Golovina: None. A.

30762,"Slovenia Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent cancers in humans. The disease occurs sporadically in most of the cases (75% 80%) as a result of the accumulation of both mutations and epigenetic modi ï¬ca tions of several genes. Approximately 20 50% of primary colorectal tumors contain K ras mutations and it was shown that MGMT methylation may play a role preceding the development of CRC. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and forty nine fresh colorectal tumor samples and corresponding normaltissue were collected during surgical colectomy together with clinical and pathological data. Patients were followed up for ten years. Direct sequencing was used for detectionofk ras mutations and methylation speci ï¬c PCR was per formed to assess the methylation status of MGMT . Results: K ras mutations were detected in 83/249 (33%) and hyper methylated promoter of MGMT in 220/249 (88%) tumors. Survival distribution of patients with and without K ras mutation was signi ï¬cantly different (p,0,01). Patients with metastasis and hyper methylated MGMT promoter in their primary CRCs had signi ï¬cantly worse survival distribution than patients without hyper methylation (p ,0,05), while in non metastatic cancers this was not the case. Response to radiation therapy was sig niï¬cantly better in tumors with methylated MGMT promoter (P< 0,001). Conclusion: No signi ï¬cant correlation was observed between K ras mutations and MGMT methylation. MGMT promoter methylation might be a good diagnostic marker in normal appearing mucosa, both for early detection of and risk assessment in colon cancer, as well as may predict abetter response to radiation therapy, as we have shown in this study.

However, a genetic component is suspected to contributeto CRC in approximately 20% 30% of all cases. Tran scriptome analysis reveals established pathogenic variants as well as alternative mechanisms affecting transcription incandidate genes. Material and Methods: Transcriptome analyses, (Illu mina paired end read sequencing (2 x 150 bp)), were per formed on 50 patients without any causative variant detected with commonly used techniques. In parallel the patients were analyzed on a comprehensive panel includinghigh penetrant susceptibility genes and candidate genes (50 kb upstream and downstream UTR regions, intronic and exonic regions).

Cheah1,2,3 1Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore, 2National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore, 3Duke NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore Introduction: Dysregulation of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been recently implicated in cancers. Up regulation of two lncRNAs, CCAT1 andCCAT2 has been separately associated with more aggressive colorectal cancer (CRC) and worse prognosis. The ï¬rst GWAS identi ï¬ed SNP linked to CRC risk, rs6983267, maps to CCAT2 , and is reported to elevate the expression of c Myc , situated about 300 kb away. Nevertheless, these twolncRNAs have never been studied together with their oncotarget c Myc. Material and Methods: In this study, we measured the expression of CCAT1 ,CCAT2 andc Myc in 150 matched mucosa tumor samples of early stage microsatellite stable Chinese CRC patients with de ï¬nitive metastasis status by real time RT PCR. The expression pro ï¬le is then correlated to the SNP genotype and the clinical data. Results: Expression of c Myc in the tumor is signi ï¬cantly up regulated in metastasis positive CRC patients (T test, p,0.0229) and signi ï¬cantly correlated to time to metastasis by Cox regression analysis [Hazard Ratio ,1.47 (1.10, 1.97), p ,0.0107]. Upregulation of c Myc expression is also signiï¬cantly associated with the risk genotype (GG) of rs6983267. The expression of c Myc is signi ï¬cantly (p<0.0001) correlated to that of CCAT1 and CCAT2 (R 2,0.23 and R2,0.18 respectively) in the tumors. How ever, the expression of CCAT1 and CCAT2 is not sig niï¬cantly correlated to metastasis status, time to metastasis or the SNP genotypes. Conclusions: Expression of c Myc in the tumors is pre dictive of metastasis. The expression of CCAT1 andCCAT2 does not add to the predictive value suggesting that theircontribution to metastasis are probably accounted for via their effects on c Myc . L. Thean: None. H.

CS is characterized by macrocephaly, mucocutaneous lesions and an increased risk of breast and thyroid cancer. Rare ovarian cancer cases (mostly embryonic tumours) asso ciated to PTEN have been described in the literature and there are no current CS guidelines available for ovarian cancer risk management. Clinical Presentation: We report the case of a woman diagnosed with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) at age 28. The patient dysplayed macrocephaly, trichilemmomas,oral papillomatosis and acral keratosis. A thyroid follicular neoplasia was diagnosed synchronously. A family history of cancers within the PTEN related tumor spectrum was identi ï¬ed. PTEN sequencing revealed that she carried a germline inherited pathogenic variant c.388C>T, p. (Arg130*) (NM_000314). A somatic MMR immunohis tochemistry analysis showed a normal expression and BRCA1/2 germline sequencing revealed no mutation. An ovarian cell immunohistochemistry analysis reported totalloss of PTEN expression, which strongly suggested the PTEN role in the oncogenesis of this cancer. Hence, a total thyroid resection was performed instead of thyroid lobect omy and bilateral mastectomy was discussed. Co occurrence of this germline mutation in PTEN in this1558patient, early development OCCC at age 28 and total loss of PTEN expression in the tumor support the involvement of PTEN in the cancerogenesis of her ovarian cancer. Conclusion: We describe a new ovarian cancer case with an atypical histological type, clear cell carcinoma, in CS. This observation might be a ï¬rst clue to expand PTEN related tumor spectrum with OCCC. The CS diagnosis changed her management. K. Yauy: None. M. Imbert Bouteille: None. V. Bubien: None. C.

OCA is caused by compound heterozygous or homozygous germ line variants in one of four genes: TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 and SLC45A2 . Due to a lack of melanin production, OCA patients have a heightened sensitivity to ultra violet radiation, predisposing them to skin cancers, includingcutaneous melanoma (CM). Methods: Approximately 5 12% of CM is considered familial. We sought to investigate the unexplained predis position in families negative for the known susceptibility genes using next generation sequencing of affected indivi duals. Variants of interest were con ï¬rmed and cosegrega tion was assessed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Several heterozygous germline variants in TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 andSLC45A2 were present in our familial CM cohort. Of note, are variants classi ï¬ed as pathogenic in association with OCA that were either present in multiple families or fully cosegregated with CM. The TYR p. T373Kvariant was present in 3 unrelated CM families. In OCA2, we observed p. V443I in three families and p. N489D in two families. We also identi ï¬ed a novel likely pathogenic SLC45A2 frameshift variant fully co segregating in a family of 4 CM cases. Conclusions: Rare, heterozygous variants in OCA genes TYR, OCA2, SLC45A2 andTYRP1 occur in some familial CM cases. Cosegregation analysis showed similar results to the medium penetrance MITF p. E318K variant, and the known functional consequence of these albinism gene var iants on pigmentation pathways indicates these OCA genesmay increase CM susceptibility in some families. V.

In vivo Tamoxifen is biotransformed by the CYP2D6 enzyme into endoxifen. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy with Tamoxifen in patients with luminal A and B primary operable BC by CYP2D6 genotyping. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eleven women with IA IIB stage BC receiving tamoxifen were enrolled in the study. Real time PCR for detection of allelicvariants CYP2D6*3 (c.2549delA), CYP2D6*4 (c.1846G>A) and CYP2D6*6 (.1707) was performed. Relapse free survival (RFS) was estimated depending ontheCYP2D6 genotype. Results: We revealed 78 patients (70,2%) with wild type alleles of the CYP2D6 gene (extensive metabolizers(EM)), 26 women (23,4%) intensive metabolizers (IM) and 7 patients (6,3%) âpoor metabolizers (PM). The average duration of Tamoxifen therapy was 2,7 years. We observeddifferences in RFS in patients treated only Tamoxifen in the adjuvant period.

Aim: Objective in our study was to evaluate expression of mRNA TSHR in patients with DTC and then to correlatethe expression with clinical features: thyroglobulin (sTg) value, initial staging, whole body scan (WBS), neck ultra sound (US) and received dose of radioiodine. Material and Methods: Forty patients were subdivided in groups according response to treatment: patients with incomplete structural response (TCs), incomplete bio chemical response (TCb) and excellent responders (TCr). Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood and used for two step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) with appropriate primers. Relative quanti ï¬cation with the 2 ÎÎCtmethod was applied. Thyroglobulin was eval uated with immunohistochemical analysis. Initial stageaccording TNM staging system was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with Spearman Rank Order Correlation. Results: Patients from TCs group expressed mRNA TSHR by a 5.37 fold higher level than TCr patients, TCb expressed TSHR by an 8.88 fold higher level than TCrpatients. Signi ï¬cant negative correlation was detected between sTg and ÎCt (Ct TSHR CtGAPDH ) value (R , 0,475; p<0,05) and between WBS/US ï¬ndings and ÎCt (R, 0,321; p<0,05). Correlation between initial stage and ÎCt revealed non signi ï¬cant negative correlation and non signiï¬cant positive correlation between received dose of radioiodine and ÎCt. Conclusion: Our data revealed higher expression of mRNA TSHR in blood of TCs and TCb compared to TCr group and further analysis revealed signi ï¬cant correlation between mRNA TSHR and sTg and US/WBS ï¬ndings.

Despite of radical surgical resection and intensive therapy, recurrenceswith new genetic properties frequently appear. We compared genomic pro ï¬les of 11 paired primary and recurrent gliomas to identify aberrations related to tumorrecurrence and/or progression. Tumor samples obtained during routine surgery were analyzed with SNP array (Illumina), I FISH (Abbott,MetaSystems), MLPA (MRC Holland) to assess copy number variations and IDH1 mutations and with MS MLPA to investigate methylation of MGMT and MLH3 promoters. In both primary and recurrent lesions, we observed genomic changes typical for gliomas: loss of chromosome10, gains on chromosome 7, losses on 9p and 13q, 17p LOH and/or IDH1 mutations. In 7/11 recurrences, the genetic pro ï¬le showed additional chromosomal imbalances compared to primary tumor. In 4/11 pairs, the pro ï¬les were divergent, i.e. the recurrences included additional changes but missed some of the original ones. Losses of chromo somal regions 6p21.33, 6q27, 9q21.13, 11p11.2 and hypermethylation of MGMT and/or MLH3 were repeatedly1560detected in recurrences. The progression to a higher grade of glioma occurred in 5/11 patients. We suppose that recurrence of brain gliomas may be driven by proliferation of cells with additional genomic imbalances to those detected in primaries or by one or more subclones presented within the primary tumor besides themajor tumor clone. Our results indicate that recurrences are often genetically and/or epigenetically different from pri mary lesions, therefore the patients with recurrent tumorsmay bene ï¬t from different treatment approaches.

While the mutational landscape of sporadicMM has been extensively investigated, the genetic basis of familial MM remains largely unknown. We used exome and targeted sequencing in families with several cases of MM/MGUS to identify rare germline var iants implicated in MM susceptibility. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1561We observed putative loss of function (two splicing (c.1755 +1G>T, c.1883 +1G>C) and one stop loss (c.2875T>C, p.*959Glnext*14)) germline variants in DIS3 , a frequently somatically mutated gene in MM, in 4 out of 154 families (2.6%). We demonstrated that the c.1755+1G>T allele undergoes Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD), resulting in a marked reduction in DIS3 gene expression levels, while the p.*959Glnext*14 variant reduces DIS3 protein levels, consistent with loss of function variants. In an independent series of 781 spora dic MM patients and 3534 controls from the MMRF CoMMpass Study we demonstrated that rare, putative likelydeleterious variants in DIS3 were enriched among MM patients compared to controls (OR ,1.92 95%CI:1.25 to 2.96, p,0.001). Transcriptome analysis of MM tumor cells suggested that, in comparison to non carriers, carriers of germline DIS3 likely deleterious variants showed dysregu lation of RNA processing pathways, consistent with dis ruption of DIS3 function. Our observations are consistent with a role for DIS3 in genetic susceptibility to MM/MGUS and reinforce its rolein myelomagenesis.

Outcomes of most genomic studies have important limitations due to the presence of different cell types within these cancers. Our study aimed at investigating intra and intertumor hetero geneity by targeted sequencing of sorted cancer subpopula tions. Archival material from 38 EACs, classi ï¬ed according to Lauren, was processed using a high throughput cell sorting technology. Stromal and tumor cell populations were sorted by immunolabelling for vimentin/pan cytoker atin and DNA content. Targeted sequencing was performed for 63 cancer related genes. 31 out of 38 EAC carried at least one somatic mutation, not present in the correspondingsorted stromal cells. In 25/38 (65.7 %) of cases mutations were detected in TP53 and in 5/38 (13.2%) of cases in CDKN2A . Mutations in other genes occurred at lower frequency, including HNF1A (2/38 cases), not previously associated with EAC. Most of the mutations were also identi ï¬ed in unsorted cells, however with a lower allele frequency, whereas in one case the mutation was com pletely missed. Interestingly, in some EAC cases, we isolated different keratin positive cell populations based onDNA content (hyperdiploid and pseudodiploid clones) with different mutational loads, con ï¬rming the high intra tumor heterogeneity of these cancers. In conclusion, selectivesorting allowed us to identify somatic mutations not identi ï¬able in the unsorted cells and to isolate different cancer subpopulations, representative of different cancersubclones.

BARD1 mutated BC index patients showed a signi ï¬cantly younger mean age at ï¬rst diagnosis (42.3 years, range: 24 60 years) compared with the overallstudy sample (48.6 years, range: 17 92 years; P ,0.00347). Overall, rare and predicted damaging (SIFT, MutationTaster)BARD1 missense variants were signi ï¬cantly more prevalent in BC index patients compared with controls (OR ,2.15; 95% CI,1.26 3.67; P ,0.00723). Neither LoF variants nor predicted damaging rare missense variants in BARD1 were identi ï¬ed in 451 familial index patients with OC. Due to the signiï¬cant association of germline LoF variants in BARD1 with early onset BC, we suggest that intensi ï¬ed surveillance programs should be considered for women carrying patho genic BARD1 gene variants.

Several studies have shown that FANCM truncating variants are particularly associated with ER and triple negative (TN) BC. However, additional high, moderate and low risk cancer genes in FANCM carriers have not been well studied. Here, we present the clinical and genetic data of BC/OC patients carrying truncating FANCM variants. Material and Methods: We have sequenced 94 cancer associated genes in 344 (331 BC, 10 OC and 3 BC/OC)patients using Illumina TruSight Cancer kit on a MiSeq platform. Results: As expected, the highest prevalence of patho genic variants was found in BRCA1 (26 patients, 7.6%) and BRCA2 (32 patients, 9.3%) genes. CHEK2 and FANCM were the next most frequently mutated genes (5/344, 1.5%each). Four different truncating FANCM variants [c.1972C>T, p.(Arg658Ter), c.2953delG, p.(Glu958fs), c.5048_5022del, p.(Lys1683fs) and c.5791C>T, p.(Arg1931Ter)] were identi ï¬ed in three BC, one OC and one BC/OC patient. Interestingly, four (80%) of the FANCM carriers had co inherited pathogenic variant in BRCA2 (n,2),BRCA1 (n,1) and FANCE (n,1) genes. These ï¬ndings suggest that the penetrance of FANCM pathogenic variants depends on the co inheritance of pathogenic var iants in other cancer genes. The two FANCM/BRCA2 car riers had ER +BC, while FANCM/FANCE and only FANCM BC carriers had TN BC, suggesting that the pre sence of BRCA2 mutations modi ï¬es the BC ER expression inFANCM carriers. Conclusion: Our study supports the ï¬nding of FANCM as a novel BC/OC susceptibility gene, and further suggests an oligogenic disease course in FANCM mutation carriers. M. Jakimovska: None. K.

By multigene panelanalysis, we identi ï¬ed two compound heterozygous patho genic BRCA1 mutations, p.(Cys61Gly) and p. (Arg1699Gln), in a female index with breast cancer at theage of 30 years. The p. Cys61Gly mutation confers high cancer risk, while the hypomorphic p. Arg1699Gln mutation is associated with an intermediate cancer risk. A cytodiag nostic test for FA was negative in patient`s PBLs. Clinical investigations revealed mild FA like features, i.e. low height (150 cm), mild microcephaly (52 cm circumference),cafÃ© au lait macules, and severe chemotherapy induced hematotoxicity. Functional analyses of the hypomorphic p. Arg1699Gln mutation revealed impaired BRCA1 function ality in DNA repair and replication forks stabilization.

30777,"Institute of Biophysics, JKU, Linz, Austria Introduction: Certain point mutations in the FGFR3 gene have a very high mutation frequency in sperm compared to the genome average that increases with age. Studiesproposed this effect to be linked with single nucleotide substitutions causing the expansion of spermatogonial stemcells following a germline selection model. As a tyrosine receptor kinase (RTK) family member, FGFR3 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Therefore, severe phenotypes are associated with aberrant receptor signaling caused by these mutations, which have also been detected in numerous human cancers. Materials and Methods: We are currently screening de novo mutations in the FGFR3 occurring at increased levels (>10 5) in human sperm with duplex sequencing. In this study, we are testing the functional changes associated with the discovered mutations in a structure function analysis. Speci ï¬cally, we are determining potentially altered signal ing of different mutated FGFR3 in comparison to the wild type receptor at three different levels: 1) Analysis of tyr osine phosphorylation in the kinase region of the receptorvia phospho speci ï¬c Western blotting; 2) Measuring the dynamics of receptor stoichiometry on the cell surface using single molecule microscopy (TOCCSL); 3) Evaluation ofintracellular calcium kinetics by ratiometric analysis of Fura 2 loaded cells. Conclusions: In this study we are functionally char acterizing newly described rare mutations arising in the male germline using highly quantitative biophysical meth ods. This study will provide new insights in the processesunderlying increased signaling of mutated RTKs coupled with aberrant signaling in mutant cells.

Temozolomide is an alkylating agent which is used for GBM treatment. Although temozolomide has a remarkable effect, the high application dose reveals the necessity of combination with other agents in thetreatment of GBM. AZD3463 is a novel ALK tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor which is over expressed in GBM. The aim of this study was to investigate whether theinhibition of ALK positively affects the activity of temozolomide in GBM. Temozolomide and AZD3463 were dissolved in DMSO. T98G GBM cell line obtainedfrom ATCC was cultured via EMEM. The cytotoxic effects of temozolomide, AZD3463 and their combination were determined in time and dose dependent manner by usingWST8 (Biointersect) assay. IC50 values and the combina tion index (CI) were calculated by CalcuSyn (Biosoft). Effects of the agents on apoptosis and cell cycle status weredetermined by BD accuri C6 ï¬ow cytometry and Annexin V (BD Biosciences) and Cycletest plus DNA (BD Biosciences) assays, respectively. IC50 values of temozo lomide and AZD3463 were determined as 1.54mM and 529nM on 48th hours, respectively.

30782,"1Laboratory of Molecular genetics, Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,2Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Gliomas are highly aggressive brain tumours, exhibiting extreme genetic and clinical heterogeneity. It is these variabilities that represent a great challenge in their diagnosis and treatment, and are major causes of highmortality. Development and advances of high throughput sequencing techniques identi ï¬ed several new single nucleotide variants and gene rearrangements. Characteriza tion of gene fusions and how they affect cellular processes in glioma oncogenesis will help us extend our knowledge of tumour biology and contribute to more personalized andtargeted treatment of the disease. Routine NGS analysis of the FFPE tissue sample of pilocytic astrocytoma in a 7 year old boy revealed a fusionbetween the ETV1 oncogene and the PTPRZ1 gene. To the best of our knowledge, there is no mention of the PTPRZ1 ETV1 (PE) fusion in glioma or any other type of cancer todate. In order to validate the PE fusion, we used PE fusion speciï¬c primers for RT PCR and subsequent Sanger sequencing. Both ETV1 and PTPRZ1 genes are thought to act as oncogenes. ETV1 is a member of ETS family of transcrip tion factors, known tumour promoting factors of Ewingsarcoma and prostate tumours. PTPRZ1 is considered as a tumour growth promoting oncogene in glioma. In 8 15% of glioma, PTPRZ1 is fused to the MET oncogene a ZM fusion, which is associated with poorer prognosis but also represents a positive predictive biomarker for treatment with kinase inhibitors. Regarding all, PTPRZ1 ETV1 fusionpresents a novel possible target for glioma treatment; however, functional studies are needed to determine the impact of the fusion in pathogenesis of glioma. A.

Here, we examine an association of FOCAD loss with overall survival of glioma patients, and address themolecular mechanisms that govern the suppressive effect of focadhesin on glioma tumorigenesis. We found FOCAD loss to be associated with profoundly inferior outcome inpatients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant WHO grade II to IV astrocytic gliomas. Multivariable analysis of WHO grade II to IV astrocytic gliomas con ï¬rmed FOCAD loss as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Subsequently, using a yeast two hybrid screen and pull down assays, we identi ï¬ed tubulin beta 6 and other members of the tubulin family as novel focadhesin interacting partners. We demonstrate that tubulins and focadhesin co localize at the centrosome, and that focadhe sin is enriched in proximity to centrioles. Focadhesin also localizes to microtubules via its interaction partner SLAIN motif family member 2, and reduces microtubule growthvelocity, possibly explaining why focadhesin decreases cell migration. During the cell cycle, focadhesin levels peak prior to mitosis and in ï¬uence time dependent mitotic progression, providing a possible explanation for focadhesin dependent cell growth reduction. We concludethat FOCAD loss is associated with decreased overall survival in subsets of glioma patients, a prognostic effect that may be linked to our ï¬ndings that focadhesin physically interacts with tubulin family members, impacts microtubule assembly and mitotic progression.

We set out to test if this is truefor other types of tumors as well. Materials and Methods: We studied SEZ6L by quanti tative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) on tumor derived DNA samples. In total, we studied: 55 female and 18 male breast tumors, 30 grade II III and 30 grade I endometrial tumors 38 ovarian tumors. Results: We identi ï¬ed SEZ6L ampli ï¬cations in 1 (1.7%) of female breast cancers, 3 (16.7%) of male breast cancers, 1 (3.0%) of grade II III and 2 (6.6%) of grade I endometrialcancers and 3 (7.9%) of ovarian cancers. We found SEZ6L heterozygous deletions in 23 (39.7 %) of female breast cancers, 4 (22.2%) of male breast cancers, 10 (33.3%) ofgrade II III and 3 (10.0%) of grade I endometrial cancers and 19 (50.0%) of ovarian cancers We described SEZ6L homozygous deletions in 22 (37.9%) of female breastcancers, 6 (33.33%) of male breast cancers, 5 (16.6%) of1568grade II III and 5 (16.6%) of grade I endometrial cancers and 4 (10.5%) of ovarian cancers. Conclusions: Though SEZ6L had, until now, only been shown to be altered in lung cancer, we show that a great percentage of gynecological tumors present alterations, thus, potentially linking SEZ6L with these types of tumors.

Currently extensive research focusses on theidenti ï¬cation of pathogenic variants causative for the development of the disease. Materials and Methods: NGS based multiple gene panel resequencing in combination with a high resolution CGH array was used to identify genetic risk factors for HBOC in 237 high risk patients who were previously tested negativefor pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants. Results: We identi ï¬ed 32 pathogenic variants in 14 dif ferent genes ( ATM, BLM, BRCA1, CDH1, CHEK2, FANCG, FANCM, FH, HRAS, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C andNBN ) in 30 patients (12.7%). Two pathogenicBRCA1 variants that were previously undetected due to less comprehensive and sensitive methods were found. Five pathogenic variants are novel, three of which occur in genes yet unrelated to hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (FANCG, FH andHRAS ). In our cohort we discovered a remarkably high frequency of truncating variants inFANCM (2.1%), which has recently been suggested as a susceptibility gene for hereditary breast cancer. Two patients of our cohort carried two different pathogenicvariants each and 10 other patients in whom a pathogenic variant was con ï¬rmed also harbored a variant of unknown signiï¬cance in a breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene. Conclusions: With our screening strategy, we were able to identify pathogenic variants predisposing for tumor for mation in 12.3% of BRCA1/2 negative breast and/or ovarian cancer patients.

Rauch1 1Institute of Medical Genetics (IMG), University of Zurich, 8952 Schlieren ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland,2Department of Gynecology, University Hospital of Zurich, ZÃ¼rich,Switzerland Objective: For the ï¬rst time, in a retrospective non cancer related cohort of a single Swiss genetic center, we systematically assessed the prevalence of secondary ï¬nd ings in 19 susceptibility genes for hereditary breast andovarian cancer (HBOC). Design: A total of n,400 non cancer related individuals undergoing whole exome sequencing were included afterquality assessment (mean age of 43 years). The majority of the cohort were Caucasian (n ,336, 84.0%), for n,170 individuals (42.5%) of which an autochthonous Swissdescent was assumed. Each rare variant (MAF â¤0.65%) was manually evaluated according to the ACMG AMPAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1569standards including ""hypomorphic"" as additional distinct pathogenicity class. Results: Overall, 526 rare secondary variants were encountered with the BRCA1/2 genes accounting for 27.2% of the total variant yield. If strati ï¬ed for variant patho genicity, for BRCA1/2 , three pathogenic variants were found in three females of Italian ancestry (carrier frequency of 0.8%). In the 17 non BRCA genes, ï¬ve carriers of (likely) pathogenic variants (1.3%) were identi ï¬ed with two Swiss individuals harboring the CHEK2 Arg160Gly variant being known as recurrent among Caucasians. Hence, the overall carrier rate of a (likely) pathogenic variant summed up to2.0%. Additionally, seven various hypomorphic alleles were detected in 22 individuals (5.4%). Conclusion: Herein, we provide ï¬rst evidence for a high prevalence of HBOC related cancer susceptibility in the heterogeneous Swiss general population and relevant sub populations, particularly in individuals of Italian descent. These pioneer data may further substantiate considerations about population based HBOC screenings. This study was funded by a von Sick CardioOnco grant. D. Kraemer: None. S. Azzarello Burri: None. K.

Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy The use of multigene panels allowed the identi ï¬cation of carriers of pathogenic variants (PVs) in 2 or more cancer predisposing genes (CPGs). The condition has been named Multiple Inherited Neoplasia Alleles Syndrome (MINAS):here we present 6 new cases and discuss the implications. The NF1 gene was involved in two cases, associated with RET andMSH2 PVs, respectively. Both patients presented clinical NF1 in addition to positive family history (known familial RET PV) and personal and family history of early onset colon cancer, respectively. The latter patient alsodeveloped three independent soft tissue sarcomas, that are uncommon in both NF1 and Lynch syndrome. The other cases involved BRCA1 and/orBRCA2: 1) early onset breast cancer, ovarian cancer ( BRCA1 +BRCA2 ); 2) macroce phaly, skin lesions, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer in theproband, whose father had breast cancer ( BRCA2 +PTEN ); 3) early onset breast cancer and renal cancer with lung cysts in 2 siblings ( BRCA1 +FLCN ); 4) bilateral breast cancer, pheochromocytoma, and medullary thyroid cancer ( BRCA1 +RET). Overall, in 5 patients we actively searched for a second PV whereas the diagnosis was incidental in onecase. Our data indicate that the phenotypes of patients with Multiple Genetic Tumor Syndromes (MGTS) can be the sum of the different syndromes or driven by one of the twogenes or they might represent a multiplicative effect. MGTS should be actively searched in all patients with complex/ atypical phenotypes or a suggestive family history, thatcannot solely be explained by defects in a single CPG. F. Brugnoletti: None. E.

VAN ASPEREN1 1Leiden University Medical Center, Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden, Netherlands,2Erasmus University Medical Center, Department of Clinical Genetics,Rotterdam, The Netherlands, Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: For many patients from families with strong suspicion for hereditary cancer no pathogenic variant can be found using single gene or small gene panel sequencing methods. The aim of this study is to evaluate the yield of exome sequencing in patients in whom standard diagnostics did not lead to a molecular diagnosis. Furthermore, we discussadvantages and disadvantages of implementation of exome sequencing in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing was per formed in 130 patients with a strong suspicion for heredi tary cancer who had tested negative in previous genetic tests for germline variants. A panel of 209 genes proven to becausal for cancer or associated with cancer was analyzed. Results: We identi ï¬ed 10 pathogenic variants in 130 patients (7.7%) which are (partially) causative of the phe notypes in the families. These ten pathogenic variants were found in ATM (3 times), LZTR1 ,PALB2 ,PMS2 (2 times), MUTYH ,SUFU ,TGFBR1 . Additionally, 22 pathogenic/ deleterious variants were identi ï¬ed which did not match the family âs cancer phenotype. Furthermore, we selected some1570variants with high prior probability of pathogenicity based on the function of the gene, in silico data and frequency of the variant in control cohorts for further research. Conclusions: Our study shows that exome sequencing, also after standard tests, is valuable in identifying the cau sative pathogenic variants. However, given the associatedcosts and workload for clinical molecular geneticists at this moment, it should only be offered to speci ï¬c families when targeted analysis of the most relevant genes is negative.

Tumors and polyps with exonu clease domain mutations exhibit an increased mutation rate(hypermutation) and a speci ï¬c associated mutational signature. We aim at de ï¬ning the tumor spectrum of the syndrome, assess the prevalence of POLE/D1 pathogenic mutations in hereditary cancer, and evaluate the challenge of variant classi ï¬cation for these genes. Materials and Methods: We studied a total of 1,525 unrelated probands referred for genetic counseling: a pro spective cohort of 1,021 hereditary cancer patients sub jected to a multi gene hereditary cancer panel, whichincluded the whole sequence of POLE andPOLD1 ; and 504 patients without mutations in known cancer predisposing genes, selected according to their phenotypic character istics, where POLE/D1 exonuclease domains were directly sequenced. Co segregation analyses, case control allele frequencies, yeast based assays and tumor mutational ana lyses (mutation burden and mutational signatures) were performed for variant interpretation. Results: We identi ï¬ed 8 missense variants within the exonuclease domain, 4 loss of function and 5 missense predicted deleterious variants outside the exonuclease domain; all of them with population allelic frequencies<1%. Pending interpretation of the clinical impact of loss of function and non exonuclease domain mutations, our results, implemented in the ACMG/AMP guidelines forvariant classi ï¬cation, allowed us classify 2 variants as pathogenic, 2 as benign, and 4 as variants of unknown signiï¬cance. Conclusions: Our study reveals relevant challenges for the classi ï¬cation of POLE/POLD1 variants, which need to be considered for routine genetic diagnostics. P. Mur: None. S. GarcÃ­a Mulero: None.

Our aim was to ï¬nd gene regions that were altered in early onset breast cancer and, within thoseregions, study candidate genes. Materials and Methods: Early onset breast cancer samples were studied by comparative genomic hybridiza tion (CGH) arrays and candidate gene was studied by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in 22 early onset breast and 15 ovarian cancer samples. Also, we ana lysed the same candidate gene by qPCR in nine breast cancer cell lines: HCC1569, MDAMB415, MDAMB231, Bt474, Bt549, MCF7, AU565, HBL100 and SUM149. Results: The CGH arrays showed deletion of 8p11.22 in 22% of samples. However, HTRA4 (a gene located in this locus) qPCR studies showed abnormal ampli ï¬cation in 81.8% of breast cancer samples and in 80% of the ovarian cancer ones. Moreover, this gene was ampli ï¬ed in three of the nine cell lines studied and deleted in other ï¬ve cases. Conclusions: Our results show for the ï¬rst time that HTRA4, a gene involved in trophoblast implantation and deregulated in eclampsia, could also be involved in early onset breast and ovarian cancer.

Not all patients respond to the checkpoint inhibitors treatment,especially in glioblastoma multiformae (GBM). The expression of checkpoint genes is variable and prone to the regulation of yet unrevealed mechanisms. Our study isaimed at evaluating the transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation of checkpoint mRNAs. We analysed the expression of mRNAs from 617 adult GBMsamples from the TCGA, as well as from 4 cell lines by RT PCR. Of 22 mRNAs suggested in the literature to be expressed on the 'cancer side' of the immunologicalsynapse, only a small fraction seem to be expressed in GBM, using a pre de ï¬ned expression cutoff, some of which were not mentioned in GBM literature so far. Theexpression of several genes is upregulated, eg. PD L2, compared with normal tissue data, and seem to be co expressed together. Other genes are signi ï¬cantly down regulated or not expressed at all eg. CD80, suggesting the possible reason for many failures of checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy in GBM. Our results may suggest that mostof the genes involved in the formation of immunological synapse are signi ï¬cantly down regulated or not expressed at all in GBM, providing the potential explanation for manyfailures of checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy in GBM. Studying the crosstalk between checkpoint genes and their regulation might be crucial for improving immunotherapy. Revealing novel interconnections may aid in the develop ment of new diagnostic tools, outcome predictors, immu notherapeutic drugs or combinations. P. Dobosz: None. P. A. Stempor: None. D.

Several recommendations about the return of IF have been published. Some professional societies encouraged the use of panels to avoid IF detection. Little is known about the impact of suchresults on the patients in the context of diagnostic panel testing in oncogenetics. Material and Methods: From June 2014 to July 2018, 2500 patients with an indication of search for genetic pre disposition to cancer bene ï¬ted from a 25 to 47 cancer genes panel. A semi structured questionnaire was proposed topatients in which an IF was detected at distance of the results to assess the understanding of the result, the change in medical care, the communication of IF to the family, thepsychological impact at time of diagnosis and at distance. This interview was conducted by phone by a physician/ genetic counsellor. Results: Twelve adult patients had the return of an IF in a cancer predisposition gene ( RAD51C, PMS2, SDHC, RET, BRCA2, CHEK2, CDKN2A, CDH1, SUFU ). To date, phone interviews have been conducted for 7 patients. Most of them had been surprised by the result, but not anxious. They all began the recommended follow up and did not regret theprocedure. Transmission of the information to their off spring was systematic but more dif ï¬cult to siblings or second degree relatives. Conclusion: IF will be inherent to the development of new technologies.

Stamatovi Ä21Institute of Pathology, Military Medical Academy, Beograd, Serbia,2Clinic of Hematology, Military Medical Academy, Beograd, Serbia Introduction: Polycitemia vera (PV) is a chronic myelo proliferative neoplasm characterized by increased red bloodcellc. The most frequent genetic abnormality is the somatic mutation of Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2 V617F) and it occurs in more than 90% of patients with PV. The aim ofthis study was to investigate the frequency of JAK2 V617F gene mutation in patients with PV and to compare results with presence of cytogenetic abnormalities and endogenouserythroid colony (EEC) formation. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 65 patients with PV were analyzed. Thediagnosis of PV was established according to the bone marrow criteria of the World Health Organization. Mutation of JAK2 V617F was determined by allele speci ï¬c pcr analysis. For detection of EEC formation we used assays of human clonogenic heamatopoietic progenitor cells with agar leukocyte conditioned medium without recombinanthuman erythropoietin. Cytogenetic analysis was done according to standard procedures. Results: Mutation of JAK2 V617F was found in the samples of the peripheral blood in 61/65 (93.8%) PV patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities, trisomy 9 and del (20q), was detected in 2/65 (3 %) patients. EEC formationwas obtained in the sample of bone marrow in 59/65 (9O,8%) PV patients. In 57/65 (87,7%) patients we detected presence of EEC formation and mutation of JAK2 V617F atthe same time. Conclusions: Presence of JAK2 V617F mutation and EEC are essential characteristics of PV. Considering theseresults, we concluded that the EEC formation observed in PV could be partially due to the JAK2 dependent activation signaling pathway. M. Strnad: None. B. Todori ÄÅ½ivanoviÄ:None.

So, the identi ï¬cation of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and the development of molecular models to distinguish patients that will recur and/or develop metastasis after treatment as well as to bene ï¬t with target therapies is of utmost importance to decrease mortality, improve survival rates and quality of life. This study aimed to develop a model of recurrence and metastasis prediction using agenomic and epigenetic characterization of laryngeal cancer samples. Material and Methods: The genomic and epigenetic characterization of 21 tumor samples from laryngeal cancer patients was performed using array comparative genomic hybridization technique, Agilent 4x180K and methylation speciï¬c multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ï¬cation technique. The most common ampli ï¬cation and deletion chromosomal regions and the respective altered genes wereidenti ï¬ed. A genomic and epigenetic signature that distin guishes between patients with metastasis/recurrence from those without, was determined using a logistic regressionclassi ï¬er with balanced training and test sets. Results: Several chromosomal regions and genes were observed with copy number alterations and methylation. The developed predictive genomic and epigenetic model comprises the 3p chromosomal region and WT1,VHL and THBS1 genes, highlighting a molecular signature with clinical applicability. Conclusion: This model for recurrence and metastasis development may help in a more practical and individua lized laryngeal cancer patient management, contributing to a more targeted drug design and, ultimately, improving patients' quality of life.

More than 90% of laryngeal cancers are squamous cell cancers. One of the most common features of solid tumors and one of the major environmental stresses ishypoxia. The reduction of the oxygen concentration below the physiological level, promotes maintenance and self renewal of the human embryonic stem cells, and reducesspontaneous differentiation in vitro. Similarities between stem cell and cancer cells suggest that both groups may use common pathways in the regulation of gene expression. Inthis study, we aimed to determine the expression levels of hypoxia induced factors HIF 1 Î±and HIF 2 Î±and embryonic stem cell genes SOX2, OCT4, NANOG and ESRRA inlaryngeal cancer patients. Material and Methods: Twenty six patients with squa mous cell laryngeal carcinoma were included in this study. Real Time PCR was performed to compare the expression levels of hypoxia inducible factors and embryonic stem cell genes in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Results: It was determined that the expression of HIF 1 Î±, OCT4 and NANOG genes were increased signi ï¬cantly in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. HIF 2 Î±, SOX2 and ESRRA gene expressions did not show sig niï¬cant differences between tumor and adjacent normal tissues.

Microarrays and sequencing cannot detect calls in segmental duplications1574and repeats, and miss balanced variants and low frequency mutations. Materials and Methods: We describe the Bionano Genomics âs Saphyr platform to identify SVs in cancer genomes. DNA >100 kbp is extracted, labelled at speci ï¬c motifs, and linearized through NanoChannel arrays. Mole cule images are digitized and de novo assembled, creating chromosomal arm scale genome maps. Cancer mutations >500 bp are detected by aligning the molecules or thegenome maps to the public reference. Results: Over the past 12 months, the power of Biona noâs cancer work ï¬ow has been demonstrated on nearly 50 various cancers, including leukemia, breast, ovarian, pros tate, pancreatic, among others. While the number of SVs varies among samples, we typically observe >5500 calls pergenome. Among leukemia samples, we captured the BCR ABL1 translocation as well as deletions impacting tumor suppressor genes such as PTPN14 and ESRRG. Weresolved the structure of large duplications (790 kbp) dis rupting BRCA1 in early onset breast cancers, found the ampli ï¬cation of MYC in lung cancers. Conclusions: In conclusion, with one platform, Saphyr can discover a broad range of traditionally refractory but relevant SVs, and improves our understanding of cancer. A. Pang: A.

30797,"St Georges Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Tooting, United Kingdom Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare inherited condition caused by pathogenic variants in TP53 . Individuals withLFS have signi ï¬cantly increased risks of cancer; 41% by age 18 and approaching 100% by 70. To date, in the UK the only national surveillance recommendation for LFS is for breast MRI. However, thereis increasing evidence for more comprehensive surveillance, including whole body MRI (WB MRI) with increasedcancer detection and survival. International recommendations were published by Kratz et al. (2017). However, these have not yet translated into NHS practice. The UK CGG therefore convened a National Consensus Group meeting on 6 thJuly 2018 to agree a consistent national approach to surveillance. A pre meeting survey was sent to 24 Regional Genetics centres (UK and Ireland). The survey results and therecommendations made by the International Group were discussed in depth at the meeting by 43 Clinical Geneticists, Genetic Counsellors, Oncologists, Radiologists and Patientrepresentatives. Prior to the Consensus meeting, less than 50% of centres agreed with the International recommendations, with only25% of centres agreeing with annual WB MRI. However, the group recognised that due to the rarity of LFS, there is a limited evidence base to support screening in terms of earlydetection and cancer mortality. On the day, consensus was reached to follow the international recommendations, with the exception of gastrointestinal surveillance. A surveillanceprotocol for children and adults with LFS and best practice guidelines for WB MRI in the UK were established. The survey results, recommendations and the clinical implementation will be presented. H. Hanson: None.",2019
30798,"Introduction: CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing generates unique opportunities in human disease modeling. It is now possible to create functional gene knockouts in a number of model organisms. Xenopus tropicalis is an aquatic organism favorable for modeling human disease due to its diploid genome,, high progeny numbers and fast embryonic external development. Li Fraumeni Syndrome(LFS) is a disorder, that predisposes for several malig nancies like sarcomas and lymphomas. Our aim is to examine whether a tp53 mutant X.tropicalis line could mimic LFS linked af ï¬ictions. Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1575Materials and Methods: Atp53 mutant X.tropicalis line was generated by injecting tp53 sgRNA precomplexed with Cas9 protein. Injected embryos were raised until sexual maturity and tp53 heterozygous and homozygous mutant progenies were raised. Animals were closely monitored for external signs of disease. Animals that were lethargic orexhibited decreased body weight or enlarged abdomen were euthanized and histologically processed. Results: Homozygous tp53 mutant animals showed rapid morbidity compared to their heterozygous counterparts. In 75% (n ,8) of tp53 / animals, disturbed architecture of the spleen was determined by CD3 and PCNA immunohisto logical analysis, implying the presence of hematologic malignancies. Furthermore, ï¬ow cytometric analysis of blood in one out of six non moribund mutants showedenrichment of CD3/CD8 positive cells, indicative of T cell leukemia. Besides hematological malignancies, animals demonstrated liposarcoma and high grade undifferentiatedspindle and round cell sarcoma. Conclusions: Our tp53 mutant line recapitulates several LFS p53 related malignancies. Our model could offer aplatform for identi ï¬cation of modi ï¬er genes and provide a sensitized background for screening for novel cancer drivers. D. Dimitrakopoulou: None. T. Naert: None. D.

All known adult eligible carriers, regardless of age, are offered to take part in a surveillanceprogram, offering yearly whole body, breast, brain MRIs and breast ultrasound. A special surveillance program for individuals <18 years old with a 50% risk of being amutation carrier or with a veri ï¬edTP53 variation, includes ultrasound of the abdomen and urine corticosteroid pro ï¬les.

So far, 25 adults and 9 children have been included in SWEP53 and 24 adults have performed their baseline MRI. In seven of the 24 adults (29%), imaging ï¬ndings needing further work up were identi ï¬ed on whole body MRI at baseline.

Despite improvementsin clinical treatment more than 50% of patients are relapsed within the next ï¬ve years. Therefore we are still looking for the most sensitive and speci ï¬c marker that would enable quick and precise diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Long noncoding RNA UCA1 (lncRNA) plays a special role in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation, differentiationand apoptosis. Methods: The presence of the UCA1 was con ï¬rmed by the real time qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction)method in 172 samples (tissue and serum) from patients diagnosed with BC. Analysis of relative gene expression levels was performed using the formula 2 dCtwith dCt ,Ct (target gene) Ct (control). The tata box binding protein (TBP) was used as a hausekeeping gene. Results: Statistical analyzes were performed using U Mann Whitney test and ANOVA Kruskal Wallis test to determine the correlation between clinical and histopatho logical parameters and primary or recurrent tumor. Wefound that the lncRNA UCA1 was signi ï¬cantly higher in both tissue and serum samples of BC patients than in1576control group and in primary BC than in recurrent tumor. The increased expression was also associated with high grade and progression. In conclusion, our results indicated that lncRNA UCA1 could be useful diagnostic and prog nostic marker for BC, however further studies with larger cohorts are necessary to evaluate it. One of the limitationsof our research is low number of tissue samples from control group. E. M. Borkowska: None. M. Traczyk Borszynska: None. P. Kutwin: None. P. Kutwin: None. T. Konecki: None. Z.

We hypothesized that these differences are due to individual germline polymorphisms modulating still unknown genetic mechan isms affecting cancer growth and metastasis. Methods: To test the role of genetic constitution in individual risk of poor prognosis, we carried out an overallsurvival genome wide association study in 584 surgically treated lung adenocarcinoma patients, genotyping >2 mil lion single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For232 samples, we had also available transcriptome data from the non involved lung tissue, that we used to test expression quantitative locus (eQTL) activity of SNPs associated withsurvival. Results: From the analysis of 1,415,218 SNPs passing quality control steps, we found four SNPs (rs75767414,rs11074720, rs147882561, and rs79851088) associated with overall survival at nominal P< 1.0 x 10 6. A multi variable Cox âs model including all the four associated SNPs, together with clinical covariates, including patholo gical stage, showed that each of the four SNPs acts as an independent risk factor for overall survival. None ofthe candidate SNPs acted as a cis eQTL, whereas three SNPs modulated expression of target genes in trans ( P< 1.0 x 10 â4). Conclusion: Overall survival of surgically treated lung cancer patients is modulated by individual geneticconstitution. We are now applying random forest models to investigate complex interactions between SNPs that could explain the observed variability in patient survival. Under standing the mechanisms underlying individual risk of poor prognosis may help discovering new tools to improve sur vival of lung cancer patients. D. Maspero: None. G. Pintarelli: None. S.

Germline DNA mutationshave not been systematically studied in this population. Next generation sequencing (NGS) could be useful to determine the proportion of young patients with NSCLCharboring germline mutations. Patients and Methods: This multicentre prospective study aims to assess whether NSCLC patients aged <51years at diagnosis harbor germline mutations using a cus tom NGS panel (I2HCP) developed in our center. This panel covers 136 genes related with hereditary cancer. Theenrolment begun on June 2018 and a total of 43 patients have been recruited. Results: Here, we present an initial analysis based on the ï¬rst 26 recruited patients. First, a restricted analysis focus ing on 26 genes involved in germline NSCLC yielded aAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1577total of 40 variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS) and 2 putative pathogenic mutations (PPat) in BLM and NBN . Next, an analysis of the whole 136 gene panel was per formed and 5 additional PPat mutations were detected in FANCA, MUTYH, NTHL1, RIT1 and SBDS . In total, 7 putative PPat mutations were identi ï¬ed in 6 patients (23% of patients from this initial cohort of 26 NSCLC patients). All variants are still being evaluated at clinical level. The ï¬nal results will be presented at the Congress. Conclusions: Based on these preliminary results, the I2HCP gene panel is useful to identify young patients with NSCLC harboring cancer hereditary predisposition.

Theï¬avonoid chrysin is a ï¬avone found in honey and propolis, and actively investigated for its potential biologi cal effects against Parkinson âs disease and the proliferation of cancer cells, as well as on the regulation of multiple cell signaling pathways [2]. Research on the pivotal role of stable Cu(II) complexes (CuCo) with physiological sub strates such as FL, in cell physiology as catalytic cofactors in the redox chemistry of mitochondrial respiration, iron absorption, free radical scavenging, and elastin cross linking have provided new insights in the ï¬eld of copper homeostasis and in particular into the understanding of intracellular traf ï¬cking and distribution of copper at molecular levels [3]. In this work two novel hybrid Cu (II) chrysin complexes were synthesized, isolated and physico chemically characterized through single crystal X ray diffraction, FT IR, UV Vis, ï¬uorescence, TGA, and ESI MS measurements. Genotoxicity estimated by the frequency of Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs), cytosta ticity based on the Proliferating Rate Indices (PRIs) and cytotoxicity based on the Mitotic Indices (MIs) at human peripheral lymphocyte cultures, were all signi ï¬cantly higher both in the case of FL and CuCo. Irinotecan (CPT) was also utilized as standard genotoxic agent and the combination of FL or CuCo plus CPT provided a mechanism by which therate of genetic damage can be induced. The novel hybrid materials exhibit enhanced solubility and bioavailability, and increased anti cancer activity compared with freechrysin and probably gives rise to fruitful bioapplications and perspectives.

Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome was performed by Sanger sequencing. A pathogenic variant wasdetected in exon 19 of MLH1: c.2150_2153dupAACA, with a clear homozygous pattern. Predictive genetic testing was performed in eight relatives. Unexpected results werefound. ProbandÂ´s mother presented the same homozygous pattern for the pathogenic variant, while the probandÂ´s father was homozygous wildtype. Furthermore, probandÂ´sbrother had also a homozygous pattern for the pathogenic variant, while his son was homozygous wildtype.

Yet, the cancer susceptibilityassociated with PMS2 mutations differ from the typical LS. The relatively small number of LS families found to segregate PMS2 mutations and the associated low disease penetrance suggest that PMS2 may not be an important susceptibility gene. The effect of decreased PMS2 mRNA expression on MMR capability was determined by in vitro MMR assay. Materials and Methods: Human ï¬broblasts were trans fected with four different PMS2 speci ï¬c shRNA targets to create knockdown (KD) cell lines with varying levels of PMS2 mRNA expression. A shRNA vector, with no known target speci ï¬city in the human genome, was used as a control. Quantitative PCR was carried out using Taqman Â® assays for PMS2 with GAPDH ,HPRT1 and ACTB asAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1579reference genes. The repair ef ï¬ciencies of the selected KD protein extracts were measured by the in vitro MMR assay. Results: KD cell lines retaining 19%, 33% and 53% of PMS2 expression demonstrated signi ï¬cantly reduced MMR efï¬ciency compared to their control cells. Surprisingly, cells retaining 53% of PMS2 expression indicated the most severe problem in the repair capability. Conclusions: Signi ï¬cant decrease in MMR ef ï¬ciency due to reduced PMS2 mRNA expression con ï¬rms that PMS2 is an equally important susceptibility gene among MLH1 ,MSH2 andMSH6 genes and that the reduction is efï¬ciently detectable by functional in vitro MMR assay.

In this study, we estimated the penetrance of CRC in Chinese patients with Lynch syndrome. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirty three families comprising 1009 members were collected. Each family was ascertained through a proband with a diagnosedCRC. Of these subjects, 300 were carriers of germline mutations in MLH1 orMSH2 , whereas 709 were non mutation carriers of these mutations. Penetrance of CRC were calculated using modi ï¬ed segregation analysis implemented by Mendel. Results: The median age at CRC diagnosis were younger in patients with Lynch syndrome than in non mutation carriers (44.3 vs. 50.4 years, P,0.0001). The cumulative risk (penetrance) of CRC at the age of 70 years were 36.5% (95% CI ,27.7% â46.9%), 34.8% (95% CI , 26.1% â45.5%), and 42.7% (95% CI ,30.1% â57.8%) in the male carriers of MLH1 orMSH2 ,MLH1 , and MSH2 germline mutations, respectively. The penetrance of CRC in the female carriers of MLH1 orMSH2 ,MLH1 , and MSH2 germline mutations were 25.8% (95% CI ,18.6% â35.2%), 24.5% (95% CI ,17.4% â33.6%) and 32.2% (95% CI , 26.3% â39.1%), respectively.

The detection ofPMS2 mutations is challenged by the presence of numerous pseudogenes and frequent gene conversion events. Long range PCR (LR PCR) in combination with single molecule long read sequencing may overcome theuse of multiple DNA and RNA based assays for the detection of PMS2 mutations. Materials and Methods: We ampli ï¬edPMS2 using three LR PCR amplicons, covering the complete gene with overlapping segments. In order to allow circular consensus sequencing, a method that increases the accuracy of long reads from 85% to >99%, we limited the size of amplicons to 16kb. Subsequently, twenty cases that showed loss of1580PMS2 expression by immunohistochemical staining of their tumor tissue were characterized for the presence of patho genic variants. Results: Long read sequencing is able to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions, exon deletions >1kb in size and accurate breakpoint mapping. Inthe rare case a deletion is missed, potentially due to allelic drop out of deletions spanning the primer binding sites, absence of heterozygosity for SNVs in one of the three LR PCR amplicons can be used to preselect cases for deletion screening by multiplex ligation probe ampli ï¬cation (MLPA). Conclusions: Long range sequencing is an attractive alternative strategy to accurately detect pathogenic variants and exon deletions in PMS2 , limiting the use of multiple assays in diagnostics. Furthermore, long range sequencing has the potential to identify novel pathogenic variants, like intragenic inversions, in cases suspected of PMS2 related Lynch syndrome, which thus far have remained without a molecular diagnosis.

Only ~30% of CRC patients with an increased risk for LS based on ageand family history is referred for genetic testing. This may be improved by universal mismatch repair de ï¬ciency (dMMR) testing in newly diagnosed CRC below age 70(CRC<70) followed by germline and somatic testing of MMR genes in those CRC patients with dMMR without MLH1 hypermethylation (U MMR work ï¬ow). Methods: The new U MMR work ï¬ow was actively implemented in daily practice of pathologists, surgeons andgastroenterologists in 19 hospitals and 13 pathology laboratories. The feasibility (uptake dMMR testing, referral rates for genetic testing, testing outcome) and appreciation of patients and clinicians were evaluated. Results: Pathologists implemented dMMR testing in 84% (3,025 of 3,602) of CRC<70. Gastroenterologists andsurgeons referred 69% of those with dMMR without hypermethylation for genetic testing. Participating clin icians and patients were overwhelmingly positive about theworkï¬ow. Among CRC patients with dMMR and without hypermethylation 55% had LS, 43% somatic bi allelic pathogenic MMR variants (non hereditary) and for 1% theresult was ambiguous. The prevalence of LS was 18% in CRC<40 and 1% in CRC40 70. Conclusions: Pathologist very well adopted the U MMR workï¬ow and gastroenterologists and surgeons increased the referral rate of CRC<70 at high risk for LS, although especially in this step the work ï¬ow needs improvement.

Recent studies revealed an interplay between TGF Î²signaling and miRNAs and their role in chemoresistance. The aim of this study was to identify TGFÎ²signaling related miRNAs and test their potential as predictive biomarkers. Materials and Methods: By in silico analysis we iden tiï¬ed miR 17 5p, miR 21 5p and miR 93 5p which regulate most TGF Î²signaling members and show altered expression in CRC.

To determine whether this modulatory effect is transient or stable, the miRNAexpression was measured on the 1 st,3rdand 6thday after the treatment with drugs combinations. Expression of miR 17 5p and miR 93 5p had a decreasing trend from 1stto 6thday after the treatments, while miR 21 5p expression was upregulated on the 3rdday but was restored close to initial level on the 6thday. Conclusions: Although tested chemotherapeutic drugs alter expression of all tested miRNAs, only miR 17 5p and miR 93 5p represent potential predictive biomarkers can didates due to their lasting downregulation.

Interest of metformin in cancertreatment and prevention re ï¬ects the recent convergence of several areas of research. Preclinical studies have shown that metformin can inhibit the cancer cells proliferation. Cancer cells take up glucose and after than transform it to lactate even under aerobic conditions, called as the Warburg effect. Suf ï¬cient amounts of products of glucose metabo lism are required for cancer cell division and rapid growth. Studies showed that, some glycolytic cell types have shown susceptibility to FX11 based lactate dehydrogenase Ainhibition. So, we investigated that effect of metformin and FX11 combination treatment on pancreatic cancer. Materials and Methods: In this study, sole exposure to metformin or FX11, and their combinations in different are investigated on PANC 1 cell line for determine the effect on cancer growth and progression.

30813,"1Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia, 2QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Australia The microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non coding RNAs that are involved in post transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms. Alterations in the expression of miRNA genes contribute to the pathogenesisof human malignancies incuding prostate cancer. In particular, the expression of miRNAs themselves could be affected by germline variants known as expressionquantitative trait loci (eQTLs). These eQTLs exert the allele speci ï¬c effects on miRNA gene expression (miR eQTLs), thereby participating in a regulatory role in canceraetiology. To identify miR eQTLs in prostate cancer, genome wide germline genotype data (Affymetrix 6.0) were obtained for prostate cancer cases from The CancerGenome Atlas (TCGA). Following genotyping quality control, imputation of non genotyped variants, we further obtained tumour tissue miRNA sequencing data from thesame set of prostate cancer patients. We performed miRNA alignment and expression quanti ï¬cation adding recently reported novel miRNAs data to the analysis. Linearregression models were used to identify potential miR eQTLs using the MatrixEQTL R package. We observed several recently reported novel miRNA genes whoseexpression was signi ï¬cantly associated (P < 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1) as well as known miRNAs with germline variants in primary tumour samples. Moreover, theresults demonstrated miR eQTLs for isoforms of known/ novel miRNAs in addition to miR eQTLs regulating the known/novel miRNAs that carry one mismatch. The resultshave highlighted the potential of exploiting miR eQTLs as a tool to map new key miRNA genes involved in prostate1582cancer, which ultimately could lead us to discover networks of dysregulated miRNAs contributing to prostate tumourigenesis.

In the present study we comprehensively analyzed the variant spectrum of color ectal adenomas from patients with biallelic MSH3 germline mutations to identify potential driver genes and pathways of MSH3 related tumorigenesis. Material and Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and array based copy number variant (CNV) analysis of 2 3 adenomas and matched normal tissuein three patients with biallelic MSH3 mutations. Results: The amount of all somatic variants in the MSH3 adenomas (36 120) and the pattern of single nucleotidevariants (SNVs) seem to be similar to sporadic adenomas, whereas the fraction (16 40%) of small insertions/deletions (Indels) is higher. Interestingly, pathogenic somatic APC mutations were found in all adenomas, and the vast majority (6 of 7) are Indels, which seem to occur more often (4 of 6) in short nucleotide tandem repeats compared to publishedsomatic and germline APC Indels. On average, 26 large deletions were found in each of three fresh frozen adenomas per patient. Besides APC,ï¬ve more genes harbor truncating mutations, missense variants, or deletions in more than onepolyp, including the suggested tumor suppressor gene ELF3 .

AA children with NB, however, more frequently develop thehigh risk form of the disease and have associated lower overall survival. We have identi ï¬ed several loci associated to NB by GWAS performed in children of Europeandescent. In this study, we have genotyped 674 AA NB cases and 3113 AA controls to investigate genetic susceptibility to NB in this population. Following high density genome wide imputation, we were able to con ï¬rm one susceptibility gene (BARD1), which reached genome wide signi ï¬cance in the subset of high risk cases. Polygenic score analysis basedon signi ï¬cance and estimates of SNP effect sizes from the European American (EA) GWAS, detected a highly signiï¬cant association (p ,2.3x10 14) with a score which included all SNPs with p < 5.5x10 7, and explained ~3% of NB risk variance in AAs. However, the signi ï¬cance of the polygenic score dropped rapidly with inclusion of addi tional SNPs, suggesting either limited sharing of NB genetic risk factors between EAs and AAs, or a genetic architecture of NB with limited contribution from common SNPs. Othergenetic analyses (including admixture mapping and haplo type association analysis) are in progress to test whether other NB susceptibility variants are located in regions of thegenome that show different genetic ancestry in AA cases versus controls. These in particular may help explain susceptibility to developing the high risk form of NB thatdisproportionately affects AA children with NB. A. Testori: None. Z. Vaksman: None. S. Diskin: None. J.

Besides very high tumour risks, CMMRD phenotypes are often characterized by the presence of signs reminiscent of neuro ï¬bromatosis type 1 (NF1). Because NF1 signs may be present prior to tumour onset, CMMRD is a legitimate differential diagnosis in an otherwise healthy, suspected NF1/Legius syndrome childwithout a detectable underlying NF1/SPRED1 germline mutation. However, no guidelines indicate when to counsel and test for CMMRD in this setting. Methods: At an interdisciplinary workshop, we discussed estimations of the frequency of CMMRD as a differential diagnosis of NF1 and potential bene ï¬ts and harms of CMMRD counselling and testing in a healthy child with no malignancy. Assuming that CMMRD is rare in these patients and that expected bene ï¬ts of identifying CMMRD prior to tumour onset should outweigh potential harms associated with CMMRD counselling and testing in this setting, we elaborated a strategy to pre select, among sus pected NF1/Legius syndrome children without a causative NF1/SPRED1 mutation and no overt malignancy, thosechildren who have a higher probability of having CMMRD. Pre selection criteria and strategies for counselling and testing were developed and reviewed in two rounds of cri tical revisions. Results and Conclusions: Existing diagnostic CMMRD criteria were adapted to serve as a guideline as to when toconsider CMMRD as differential diagnosis of NF1/Legius syndrome. In addition, the guidelines include counselling and testing strategies that are suggested to minimizepotential harms. M. Suerink: None. T. Ripperger: None. L. Messiaen: None. F. Menko: None. F.

30820,"Gennet s.r.o, Prague, Czech RepublicIntroduction: Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows to concurrently analyze germline variants of multiple genesassociated with hereditary cancer syndromes. Methods: 3118 DNA samples of oncologic patients (2177) and healthy relatives (941) from families with cancerhistory ful ï¬lling clinical criteria were analyzed using NGS panel CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) [1]. The most common types of the patientsÂ´cancer were: breast (62.6%), ovarian (12.6%), colorectal (9.2%). This panel targets 226 genes based on the genetic variability of Czech cancer patients. We evaluate 78 clini cally relevant genes. For CNV (copy number variation) detection we use sequencing coverage analysis. Results: In total samples 18,6% a deleterious variants (class 4 5) were detected in 20 % of patients with breast cancer, in 21,9 % of patients with ovarian cancer and in 21,4 % of patients with colorectal cancer. In case ofreporting only variants in genes recommended by clinical guidelines or genes covered by commercially available oncopanels the detection rate would decrease to 13%.Within CNV validation, we tested 90 ï¬ndings in 1175 individuals by MLPA. 29 (32.22%) were true positive (TP), the remaining 61 samples (67.78%) were false positive(FP). Costs in this settings dropped by 3/4 in comparison with MLPA testing only. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the pub lished ï¬ndings and highlight the importance of extending the examination to other susceptibility genes which brings more information to the patients.

However, the role of this alteration in carcinogenesis is unknown. Thus, the main aims of this study are to generate a stable colorectal cancer cell line thatdoes not express this gene and to analyse the nodal pathway in this line. Materials and Methods: CRISPR Cas9 technology was used to generate a NOMO 1 knockout from the colorectal cancer derived cell line HT29. The ef ï¬cacy of its design was tested by Sanger sequencing, quantitative polymerasechain reaction (qPCR) and western blot. To study off target effects, chromosomal differences were measured by CytoScan genomic microarrays platform. Changes in Nodalpathway protein expression were analyzed by western blot. Results: The NOMO 1 knockout cell line âs design ef ï¬ cacy was proven. However, the genomic microarraysshowed a complete deletion of chromosome 16. Nodal pathway protein expression remained unchanged except for severe downregulation of TMEM147 and Nicalin. Bothproteins are part of a transmembrane complex with NOMO. Conclusions: NOMO transmembrane complex has been reported to be an antagonist of the nodal pathway. Ourresults show that NOMO transmembrane complex is absent inNOMO 1 knockout cancer cells. However, downstream proteins remain unaltered in these cells, suggesting thatNOMO could regulate another signaling pathway in adult cancer cells.

Its inhibition decreases tumorigenesis. We performed a genetic study of the genes relevant to this pathway, as well as their potential inhibitorsin colorectal cancer (CRC). Materials and Methods: A speci ï¬c Illumina panel was designed by our group to study the Nodal pathway genesand inhibitors. This panel includes the following genes: ALK4 (ACVR1B), ACTRII, SMAD3, NCNL, SMAD4, NOMO1, SMAD2, TEMEM147, LEFTY, GPR78, TDGF1 . A total of 36 CRC were studied via sequencing in a MiSeq. The results were analyzed with VariantStudio (Illumina) and IGV 2.4 software. Results: A total of 20 pathogenic nonsense mutations were identi ï¬ed in 19 of the 36 analyzed tumors; 9 of which (45%) were found in the NOMO1 gene generating a trun cated protein. Additionally, 4 pathogenic mutations were found in SMAD3 ,3i n SMAD2 ,2i n SMAD4 and only one mutation was found in NCLN andALK4 . Conclusions: A high percentage of CRC show mutations in one of the Nodal pathway genes. Due to the high numberof mutations found, the NOMO mediated signaling could be implicated in the tumorigenesis of CRC.

A great number of studies investigated genetic expression in order to identifymarker genes that could be used for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes. However, the generalisation of expression pattern with limited number of genes may beinaccurate. Instead of using a speci ï¬c subset of genes, we propose to use the whole RNA seq pro ï¬le to improve the diagnosis and classi ï¬cation of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) through a user friendly platform. Materials and Methods: A machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) which learns from RNA seq pro ï¬les of NSCLC tissues, collected in 123 patients (tumour and non tumour samples) was applied in order to discriminate his tological subtypes of NSCLC. The method has beenimplemented within the R environment and the web plat form has been built with the Shiny package. Results: The web platform actually allows the user, ï¬rst, to provide its own RNA seq library; then it automatically ï¬ts a Random Forest model based on the expressed genes; ï¬nally, it returns a diagnosis along with its false discovery rate. The prototype was assessed and cross validated. The best results were obtained when full RNA seq pro ï¬les were provided.

However, many of novel sequence variants are not meaningful in clinical decision making and are referred as ,the gray zone â. Our study objective was to review the distribution of variants ofunknown signi ï¬cance (VUS) in high risk breast and ovarian cancer patients. Materials and Methods: 499 female patients with increased risk (young age and/or positive family history and/or triple negative breast cancer) of familial/hereditary breast or ovarian cancer were included in this study. Themean age of patients was 53.3Â±9.6. Genetic counseling and NGS analysis were performed at the Klaipeda University Hospital (Lithuania) from 2015 until 2018. Mutations weredetected using Next Generation Sequencing (Ion Torrent â¢ PGM) custom Ion AmpliSeq â¢On Demand panel (Thermo Fisher Scienti ï¬c). Custom oncogene panel was made of forty four genes, associated with familial hereditary and syndromic cancer diseases. Results: Mutations were detected in 181 of 499 (36%) samples. Pathogenic mutations consisted 61% (111) of all detected mutations. High frequency of pathogenic muta tions is explained by targeted study group of cancerpatients. 7 (4%) patients had a combination of pathogenic mutation and VUS. VUS was detected in 52 (29%) patients. Conclusions: Our results show that VUS remains an important problem in the clinical interpretation of high risk cancer patients analysis results. Thus, it is of paramount importance in diagnostic studies to classify mutationsaccording to the status pathogenic or benign, and to update biological databases. S. Vitkute: None. I. Drejeriene: None.

Circulating miRNAs proved to be promising biomarkers in various cancers. However, only few publica tions focus on circulating miRNAs in ovarian cancer especially in European populations. Materials and Methods: We screened the members of the miR34 family (miR34a, miR34b, miR34c) and miR203a in the plasma samples of patients with malignant (n ,28, I,III or IV FIGO stage), non malignant (n ,12) ovarian tumors and in age matched healthy volunteers (n ,60). The relative amount of miRNAs was detected by qPCR. Results: The expression levels of miR34a, miR34b and miR203a were higher in the malignant samples compared to the healthy donors (p<0.05; 0.001; 0.001 respectively).However, no signi ï¬cant difference was detected in the case of miR34c. Diagnostic accuracy was the highest in the case of miR203a: 84.09% with the AUC of 0.831 (95%CI,0.727 935). Spearman âs rank correlation revealed positive correlation between the expression values of miR34s and miR203a that was the highest between miR34aand miR34b. The agreement between the diagnostic tests based on miR34s and miR203a proved to be good according to the Cohen âs kappa values with the highest value between miR34a and miR34b. However, the diag nostic tests based on these miRNAs and the standard CA125 and HE4 showed low agreement. Target analysisrevealed that miR34a and miR34b share several target genes involved in cancer development. Conclusions: We conclude that miR203a and miR34b might be promising complementary markers of CA125 and HE4 in ovarian cancer. Ã. MÃ¡rton: None. D. Herrera Villarroel: None. J. LukÃ¡cs: None. A.

Sabol1 1RuÄer Bo Å¡kovi ÄInstitute, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia,2Zagreb Health School, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia,3University Hospital Centre Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia Introduction: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal cancers, mostly due to late diagnosis and limited treatmentoptions. Survivin (coded by BIRC5 gene) is an inhibitor of apoptosis, has at least ï¬ve different splice variants and is often overexpressed in cancer. Survivin is direct target ofHedgehog GLI signaling pathway, a major developmental pathway involved in organogenesis and stem cell maintenance. We investigated the role of BIRC5 polymorphisms and survivin isoform expression in OC. Additionally we investigate the role of different GLI proteins in the regula tion of survivin isoform expression in the SKOV 3 OC cell line. Materials and Methods: 40 OC samples and 74 controls were genotyped for BIRC5 polymorphisms. Survivin iso form expression was analyzed on 29 OC samples andcompared to healthy fallopian tube (FT) controls. To investigate the regulation of survivin expression by GLI proteins, GLI knock outs were developed and survivin expression was determined. Results: Fifteen different polymorphisms were found in OC samples, and there was no difference in distributionbetween OC samples and controls. Several polymorphisms showed linkage disequilibrium in OC samples. All ï¬ve isoforms were detected in OC samples, and only two iso forms in FT controls. Seven polymorphisms showed sig niï¬cant associations with isoform expression. Survivin isoforms were downregulated in GLI1 and GLI2 knock outs, but not in the GLI3 knock out. Treatment of GLI1 knock out with GANT 61 showed an additional inhibitory effect on several isoforms. Conclusions: Survivin isoform expression is regulated by both BIRC5 polymorphisms and the expression of GLI transcription factors that bind to its promoter. V. Musani: None. M. Gregori Ä:None. D.

CA125 and HE4 are frequentlyused biomarkers in ovarian cancer, however, these have low diagnostic parameters. Here we studied the diagnostic potential of circulating miRNAs in ovarian cancer. Materials and Methods: We screened the members of the miR200 family (miR200a, miR200b, miR200c, miR141, miR429) in the plasma samples of patients withmalignant (n ,28, I, III or IV FIGO stage) or non malignant (n,12) ovarian tumor and in age matched healthy controls (n,60). The relative amount of miRNAs was detected by qPCR. Results: All the tested miRNAs showed signi ï¬cantly elevated expression in the malignant samples compared to the healthy controls (p<0.001). Moreover, the relative expression of miR200a, miR141 and miR429 proved to be higher in the malignant than in the non malignant samples(p<0.05). ROC AUC proved to be the highest in the case of miR200c: 0.861 (95% CI ,0.776 0.947). Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed positive correlation betweenthe plasma levels of the studied miRNAs that was the highest between miR200b and miR200c (r s,0.775;1590p<0.001). Target analysis also suggested tight interaction between these miRNAs in the regulation of cancer devel opment. The agreement of diagnostic tests based on miRNA levels and the standard CA125 or HE4 was weak according to Cohen's kappa values. Conclusions: MiR200 family members might be pro mising complementary biomarkers in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The plasma level of tightly interacting miRNAs shows strong positive correlation.

In our work, we analyzed in DNA repair genes polymorphisms (SNPs) by TaqMan genotyping in OC peripheral blood samples. Material and methods: An association study of SNPs rs1799782, rs25487, rs1130409, rs13181, rs11615, rs1799794, rs861539, rs1042522, rs1799977 andrs1800734 of genes XRCC1, APEX1, ERCC2, ERCC1, XRCC3, MLH1 andTP53 was performed in the germinal DNA of 185 patients and 129 healthy controls. Results: the GA genotype of XRCC1 polymorphism rs1799782, the CC genotype of TP53 polymorphism rs1042522 and the GG genotype of MLH1 polymorphism rs1800734 were associated with increased susceptibility to OC. The T allele of APEX1 polymorphism rs1130409 was associated with a later onset of the disease and hereditaryOC. In relation to XRCC3 gene (rs1799794), the TT gen otype was associated with increased OC susceptibility inaging patients and patients with familial OC. In relation to MLH1 gene (rs1800734), the GG genotype was associated with greater OC susceptibility in old patients and in patients with hereditary OC. The SNP rs1799977 of MLH1 gene was associated with an increased risk of recurrence.

Its high mortality rate is partially due to lack of effective screening methods for early diagnosis. Given their ability to regulate gene expressionand presence in bio ï¬uids miRNAs could be non invasive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Total RNA was isolated from plasma samples of 18 OC (6 6 FIGO stage I, III and IV) patients and 6 healthy controls. MiRNA copy number was determined using the Nanostring System with nCounterHuman v3 miRNA Panel. Background and technical var iations were corrected for the meanÂ±2SD of negative con trols and the positive code set, respectively. Data wasnormalized by the geometric mean of 10 housekeeping miRNA counts. Signi ï¬cant differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identi ï¬ed by KruskalÂ±Wallis test with post hoc Dunn's test. Target genes, candidate pathways and lncRNA associations for signi ï¬cant miRNAs were identi ï¬ed by a network based analysis using miRNet, mirTarge tLink and Networkanalyst tools. Functional annotation clustering of target genes and pathway analysis was done with the DAVID tool. Results: 26 miRNAs were upregulated, the tumor sup pressor miR 584 5p was down regulated. In our DE miRNA set miR 25 3p/26b 5p/301a 3p/19b 3p/144 39 hadthe highest degree and betweenness centrality values, theirAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1591common targets are PTEN, BCL2L11, KAT2B, SMAD4, TP53, MALAT1, XIST, HOTAIR.

Identi ï¬cation of at least BRCA1 & BRCA2 mutations are fundamental for clinical decision making of ovarian cancer (OC) patients. We analyzed genomic DNA from 578 epithelial non mucinous OC patients for mutations, implementing acommercially available 94 gene panel. Additionally, 121 tumors were collected from OC patients with negative germline testing and assessed for somatic BRCA1 & BRCA2 mutations. Overall, 25.4% (147/578) of the patients carried germline loss of function (LoF) variants, distributed in 18 genes. After BRCA1 & BRCA2 , which accounted for 72.1% of the total, RAD51C LoF variants were the most frequent (4.8%). Interestingly, the vast majority of LoF variants (136/147; 92.5%) involved homologous recombination/Fanconi anemia genes, while 4.5% of the pathogenic variants were detected in Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway genes. Subsequently, tumor analysis resulted in theidenti ï¬cation of damaging BRCA1 & BRCA2 variants in 11.5% of the ovarian tumors tested. Variant allelefrequencies varied from 9% 47%. Altogether, approxi mately one in three of OC patients in our cohort could be good candidates for therapies targeting defective mechan isms of DNA repair, including HR and MMR. Our study highlights the high prevalence of LoF variants in HR genes, when combining germline and tumor testing in unselected,non mucinous epithelial OC patients. These genetic defects can predominantly lead to HR de ï¬ciency, the ultimate biomarker for therapeutic intervention by PARP inhibitionleading to tumor cell death. F. Fostira: None. D.

The index patient âs son was diagnosed with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma at 34 years of age soon after the moleculartesting in the family. Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma is a very rare tumor with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. He was therefore recommended testing of thetumor tissue with regards to possible targeted therapeutic options in the future (PARB inhibitor therapy).1592Using a multi gene panel we surprisingly not only iden tiï¬ed the familial BRCA1 mutation in the tumor tissue in heterozygous state but additionally found a frameshift mutation in BRCA2 (NM_000059.3:c.3708dupA, p. (Ala1237Serfs*6)) in 50% of reads as well as a well known CHEK2 founder mutation (NM_007194.3:c.1100delC, p.(Thr367Metfs*15)) in 50% and an ATM stop mutation (NM_000051.3:c.2426CG, p.(Ser809*)) in 23% of reads. The mutations in BRCA1, CHEK2 and BRCA2 could all beconï¬rmed to be germline mutations, while the ATM mutation was of somatic origin. Of interest the patient âs pedigree showed a single case of breast cancer in hisdeceased paternal grandfather at 60 years of age that had not further been investigated. This case challenges the current concept of targeted testing in hereditary cancer predisposition families, espe cially when cancer predisposition is evident in two branches of the family tree. It also poses the question of adequateclinical surveillance and predictive testing algorithms in a family with three heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes encoding for proteins that are involved in DNA repairmechanisms.

Although the underlying genetic basis for most of the familial clustering remains elusive,several familial cancer syndromes are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. In this retrospective study, 433 individuals were selected because of a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer in combination with breast and/or ovarian cancer, colon cancer or melanoma. Germline DNA was analyzed using a custom designed SeqCAP Target panel of 66 (pancreatic) cancer suscept ibility genes (Roche). Data analysis is still ongoing, but we found in 21% of the patients analyzed till now, at least one heterozygous loss of function germline mutation in one of the 66 (pancreatic)cancer susceptibility genes. As this is a high proportion of the patients, further extension of the study cohort is certainly warranted. Inparallel a matched control cohort is being analyzed to determine which genes are signi ï¬cantly more implicated in (pancreatic) cancer predisposition. Further segregationanalysis in the families is indicated to evaluate their link with the different cancers and highlight the need for recommendations governing germline multi gene paneltesting of cancer patients with a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer.

Concordance of the pro ï¬les was evaluated between cfDNA and matched FFPE tumor tissue in samples of operable patients. Analyses were ï¬nished for 16 operable patients. Clear copy number alterations (CNAs) were observed in 13 FFPE tumor samples (81%). Theproï¬les were patient unique but some recurrent alterations were ascertained. In cfDNA of none of the operable patients CNAs were established. In cfDNA of 75% (6/8) of themetastatic pancreatic cancer patients, clear CNAs were identi ï¬ed. In a next step, we are evaluating if this approach can predict recurrence. Indeed, a copy number change in afollow up sample (6 months post adjuvant chemotherapy) was observed in a borderline operative patient with metastases.

Clinical features include hamartomatous polyps,mucocutaneous pigmentation, and an increased risk for the development of gastrointestinal (GI) and various extra GI malignancies. Serine Threonine Kinase 11 ( STK11/LKB1 ) variants predispose to PJS. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used direct sequencing, followed by MLPA of genomic DNA from 5patients, clinically and histologically suspected for PJS. Four of the patients carried out known disease causing aberrations, while in one of the patients we found a muta tion which has not been reported in the literature or recor ded in mutation databases. Results: In two of the patients we discovered a hetero zygous deletion of the whole STK11 gene, determined by a 50% decrease in all MLPA probes. The third patient showed a heterozygous deletion of exon 1. The fourth and theï¬fth patient had similar alterations in exon 7, with patient 4 having an in frame deletion(c.907_915delATCCGGCAG) and the ï¬fth patient in frame duplication (c.907_915dupATCCGGCAG) within theSTK11 gene (GRCh38/hg19). Conclusions: While all of the patients reported here exhibited symptoms of PJS, the severity of the disease and the accompanying symptoms was not determined by thetype of the mutation; even in patients 4 and 5, who had alterations in the catalytic kinase domain of STK11. This suggests that even in frame alterations in the STK11 sequence have a profound effect. Our ï¬ndings are encouraging us to further investigate the relationship between the STK11 gene defects and the clinical severity of the disorder. T. K. Kadiyska: None. I. Tourtourikov: None. T.

MYO5B mutated cDNA clones (pCMV6 MYO5B Myc DKK tagged) were generated by site directed mutagenesis and stably transfected into human embryonic1594kidney cells (HEK293) and SK N AS neuroblastoma cells. All three MYO5B mutants demonstrated a signi ï¬cantly increased proliferation rate compared to MYO5B wild type clones (p<0.001). The Scratch wound assay also indicated an increased migration rate (p<0.05) in cells harboring the two somatic variants p. L587P (located in the motor domain)and p. G1611S (located in the tail dilute domain). Moreover, investigating the endocytic recycling pathway by the transferrin assay showed an increased transferrin uptake inp. L587P and p.

Here, we describe a large series of PMS2 heterozygous variants identi ï¬ed in French LS patients. Two hundred variants were identi ï¬ed in 195 patients including 114 unique variants classi ï¬ed as class 3/ 4/5 according to consensus guidelines. Although SNVs andsmall insertion/deletions were predominant, genomic rear rangements accounted for 18% of the alterations. The c.137G>T variant was observed in 36/195 families,accounting for 18% of the PMS2 LS, but the haplotype analysis failed to show a clear founder effect. The median age at ï¬rst tumour onset in class 4/5 variant carriers was 49, and the predominantly observed tumours were colorectal cancers (76.4%) followed by endometrial cancers (8.1%). The earliest age at tumour onset was 21 and 9 patientsdeveloped colorectal cancer by the age of 31. By now, no genotype/phenotype correlation was detected. Among cases with available family history, only 6.8% of class 4/5carriers had a family history ful ï¬lling Amsterdam I/II criteria. Tumours from PMS2 variant carriers exhibited microsatellite instability and loss of PMS2 expression in96% and 76% of the cases, respectively. These results conï¬rm the high predictive value of tumour loss of PMS2 expression and show that, while PMS2 variants are mostly detected in families not ful ï¬lling Amsterdam criteria, which supports their lower penetrance, they can nevertheless cause colorectal cancers before 31, which highlights the varia bility of their penetrance.

In addition to androgens, thyroid hormones have been shown to promote various cancers including PC. Active form of thyroid hormone Triiodothyronine (T3) actsthrough interaction with nuclear receptors (TR Î²/TRÎ±) and binding proteins in cytosol such as Î¼ crystallin (CRYM). In this study, we investigated the interaction of thyroidhormone with androgen signaling through its nuclear receptor beta (TR Î²1) and cytosolic binding protein (CRYM) in the progression of prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Tissue microarray (TMA) containing patient samples together with cell lines derived from metastases were used to inspect molecular mechan isms of thyroid hormone driven tumorigenesis. RNA seq identi ï¬ed alterations of gene expressions in response thyr oid and androgen signalling. Co immunoprecipitation andyeast two hybrid were employed to inspect a cross talk between androgen and thyroid signaling. Therapeutic value of thyroid inhibition was carried out through in vivo studies. Results: TRÎ²gene was identi ï¬ed as a common feature in drug resistant tumors, which predicted metastases, and relapse in PC patients. Thyroid hormone binding proteinCRYM antagonized thyroid hormone action. Immunopre cipitation and yeast two hybrid revealed interaction between androgen receptor (AR) and thyroid receptor(TRÎ²). Inhibition of thyroid hormone signaling resulted in decreased growth of tumor in vivo .

To deepen our understanding of Rb, we performed genotype phenotype associations in a cohort of 1404 consecutively ascertained Rb patients i.e. 866unilateral Rbs (URb) and 538 bilateral Rbs (BRb) followed between 2000 and 2017. Main characteristics included age at diagnosis, sex, laterality, familial history, IRC stage andmutational status. Advanced IRC stages D and E were mainly observed (67.1% and 19.4%, respectively). Germ line detection rate was 93.4% for BRb and 13.0% for URb. Mutations were scattered all along the coding sequence with a predominance of truncating mutations. Close to 50% of ï¬rst and second hits occurred in 6 distinct regions but these regions differed according to the 1 stor second hit (signi ï¬cant for promoter, exons 1, 2 and 24). Compared to nonsense mutations, risk for bilateral Rb was lower formissense, large rearrangement and in frame splice mutations (p<0.001, p<0.05 and p ,0.05 respectively). As compared to germline mutations maintaining pRb, germline mutationsinducing the absence of pRb led to an earlier median age at diagnosis (9 months vs 12 months, p<0.05), more frequent bilateral involvement (84.1% vs 65.2%, p<0.001), and anadvanced IRC stage (85.3% vs 73.9%, p<0.05). Surpris ingly, the opposite was found for 2 ndhits where absence of pRb was more often associated with unilateral RB (OR , 46.11, p<0.001). This is the largest genotype phenotype study reported to date, opening new avenues for an in depth understanding of the disease. F. Salviat: None. M. Gauthier Villars: None. M. Car ton: None. N.

Gunduz Ege University Medical Faculty, Ä°zmir, Turkey Aim: Multiple myeloma is the cancer of bone marrow plasma cells. Ruxolitinib which is a potent inhibitor of JAK tyrosine kinases is approved for treatment of myeloproli ferative neoplasms. In this study, our purpose was to determine the possible role of ruxolitinib on energy metabolism of ARH77 multiple myeloma cells which hasnot been investigated so far. Methods: ARH77 multiple myeloma cells were incu bated via RPMI 1640 medium. Ruxolitinib was dissolved inDMSO. Seahorse XFp Cell Energy Phenotype Test Kit (Agilent) was used to determine the phenotypic effects of ruxolitinib on energy metabolism of ARH77 cells. Changesin expression level of the genes which control energy pathways were determined by Glucose Metabolism RT 2 Proï¬ler PCR Array (Qiagen), RT2SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen) and qRT PCR instrument (Light Cycler480, Roche). Fold changes were calculated via 2 ÎÎCt quantitation method. Results: Ruxolitinib increased oxygen consumption and extracellular acidi ï¬cation rates 1.45 and 1.68 folds com pared to control, respectively. Ruxolitinib also regulatedexpression levels of PYGM, PGM2, PHKB, PCK2, H6PD, PDK4 and GYS2 genes higher than 2 folds, which regulate cell energy metabolism. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate that rux olitinib genetically regulates cell energy metabolism which has not been previously evaluated in ARH77 cells, and thischange is re ï¬ected in cellular phenotype. Further studies which research the potential role of ruxolitinib in energy metabolism will provide a new perspective in myelomagenetics. Ã. Biray Avci: None. B. Goker Bagca: None. N.

It is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. In search for new speci ï¬c and sensitive biomarkers we detected mitochondrial DNA copy number in whole blood(wb mtDNA) and in plasma (cell free and exosome encapsulated mtDNA) in patients with serous epithelial ovarian tumor. DNA was isolated from EDTA blood and plasma obtained from 24 patients and 24 healthy controls. Exo somes were isolated from cell free plasma, and exosomalDNA was extracted. Quantitative real time PCR was per formed with Human Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Mon itoring Primer Set. Kruskall Wallis and Mann Whitney testwere used for data analysis. Wb mtDNA copy number was signi ï¬cantly different among healthy controls and patients in multiple comparison(p,0.0090 considering FIGO stages independently, and p,0.0048 considering early and late stage cancers). There was a signi ï¬cant decrease among early stage, all advanced stage and all cancer patients (FIGO I: 32.5Â±8.3, p ,0.0061; FIGO III +IV: 37.2Â±13.7 p ,0.0139; FIGO I +III+IV: 35.6 Â±12.2, p ,0.0017) or FIGO III patients alone (32.8Â±5.6, p,0.0089) compared to healthy controls (48.6Â±17.1). We found signi ï¬cant increase in exosomal mtDNA copy number in cancer patients (236.0Â±499.0, p ,0.0155), advanced stage cancer patients (333.0Â±575.0, p ,0.0095), FIGO III (362.0Â±609.2, p ,0.0494), and FIGO IV (304.0 Â±585.0, p ,0.0393) patients alone compared to healthy controls (9.3Â±7.1) and in multiple comparison considering early and late stage cancers (p ,0.0253).

Method: To allow accurate detection of both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and CNVs, we release an enhanced version of our PicoPLEX chemistry that improvessequencing coverage, uniformity, and accuracy while increasing the resolution for CNV detection and retaining reproducibility. This enhanced chemistry named SMARTerPicoPLEX Gold Single Cell DNA Seq Kit (PicoPLEX Gold) is a single cell library prep kit with a simple, four step protocol to convert single cells into NGS libraries inunder three hours with minimum hands on time. Libraries prepared from single GM12878 cells using the PicoPLEX Gold kit were sequenced on an Illumina Â®NextSeq Â®plat form to a depth of ~35 million read pairs (2x150 cycles). Results: PicoPLEX Gold kit generates >50% genome coverage. This coverage represents a 2 fold improvementover the original PicoPLEX kit, along with a 4X reduction in duplication rates. The kit detected 3.5X more SNVs compared to Multiple Displacement Ampli ï¬cation (MDA) with the same number of reads. PicoPLEX Gold kit pro duced up to 50% lower allele dropin (false positive) rates than MDA. The increased coverage and low bias translatedto extremely low allele dropout rates (ADO), ~5X lower than MDA. Conclusion: A single PicoPLEX Gold kit library enables reliable, high resolution CNV analysis with shallow sequencing, and an accurate and reproducible SNV and CNV analysis with deeper sequencing. M.

In addition to a very high tumor risk, the CMMRD phenotype is often characterized by the presence of signs reminiscent ofneuro ï¬bromatosis type 1. Pediatric Systemic Lupus Erythe matosus (pSLE) is very rare. It has been reported so far in three CMMRD patients and has not been considered adiagnostic feature of the syndrome. Methods: Two female patients from two different families diagnosed clinically with pSLE presented withfeatures suggestive of CMMRD and were found to have bi allelic pathogenic mutations in MSH6 . Results: We report two CMMRD female patients diag nosed with pSLE and compare them to the three reported cases. Hence, there are a total of ï¬ve out of approximately 200 (2.5%) currently reported CMMRD patients that alsohave pSLE. Conclusions: Given the rarity of both CMMRD and pSLE this phenotype is signi ï¬cant and should be further explored. pSLE should raise the possible diagnosis of CMMRD if supported by additional indicative features.

There is a clear needfor developing more ef ï¬cient tests to aid clinicians in choosing the optimum treatment for each patient in a period of time no longer than 10 days. Next Generation Sequen cing (NGS) has been proven to deliver these results in an excellent manner. In this work, we provide the results obtained in a cohort of 75 adult patients suffering fromdiverse solid tumours as well as 38 paediatric patients. Adult patients obtained a signi ï¬cantly higher bene ï¬t from the study. We detected alterations of clinical relevance(SNVs, CNVs, fusion genes and MSI) in more than 90% of the cases. Based on these results, 25% of the patients could beneï¬t from different therapies including FDA approved drugs or at least one clinical trial. Besides the somatic mutations, 10.7% of the patients harboured a germline pathogenic variant that had not previously detected. Out ofthe 38 paediatric patients, 15 had the option to join a clinical trial and another three showed a genetic alteration treatable by an FDA approved therapy. Germline alterations weremore common in these patients that reached 28.9% of the cases. Genetic counselling and family studies were offered when relevant. Thanks to the results presented in this work,several patients bene ï¬ted from an accurate diagnosis that allowed clinicians to approach new therapeutic options. Families of paediatric patients were able to identifygermline mutations carried by some of their members that were yet unknown. D. A. Garcia Dios: A.

30845,"Introduction: The increasing adoption of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in molecular pro ï¬ling of cancer presents a growing need for streamlined interpretation of NGS results in clinical labs. Methods: We performed an initial assessment of an NGS result interpretation tool called NAVIFY Mutation Pro ï¬ler (NMP), which enabled us to process a Variant Call Format (VCF) ï¬le and generate a report with consensus recom mendations of NCCN, ASCO, CAP and ACMG. This annotation tool identi ï¬es pathogenic variants and variants of unknown clinical signi ï¬cance (VUS), and groups variants by AMP Tiers. At the time of this assessment, NMP con tained curation for ~4,000 variants. In this study, we used NGS results from 38 anonymized clinical cases with knowntreatment regimens to retrospectively assess NMP as the variant interpretation tool. Results: NMP correctly associated EGFR TKI therapies options with the corresponding 5 cases. As expected, NMP did not recommend targeted therapies for the 10 chemo treated control cases. For the subject relapsed against EGFRTKI, NMP correctly interpreted the complex EGFR muta tion pro ï¬le containing both activating (L858R) and drug resistance (T790M) variants. In addition, out of 22 casesrelapsed against ALK TKI crizotinib, NMP correctly marked 14 with crizotinib resistance when a known ALK variant conferring crizotinib resistance was detected. Therewas limited or no published clinical evidence to interpret the remaining 8 cases of ALK TKI resistance. Conclusions: NMP correctly interpreted cases containing EGFR and ALK variants in this study. With a highly curated knowledge base, this tool simpli ï¬es NGS clinical reporting by identifying clinically actionable mutations. M. Ma: A.

Rotthier Agilent Technologies, Niel, Belgium Introduction: Growing evidence shows that defects in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway underlie hereditary and sporadic tumorigenesis and that HRR deï¬ciency may dictate the sensitivity of tumors to cancer chemotherapy that rely on defective DNA repair. Methods: The SureMASTR HRR NGS assay contains 17 selected HRR most relevant genes. These 17 genes wereselected based on mutational analysis of a 52 HRR gene panel in 300 high grade serous ovarian cancer samples, together with the most recent literature research and inputfrom Key Opinion Leaders. The panel is comprised of the full coding region of: ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCA, FANCL, NBN,PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD54L andTP53 . Results: The SureMASTR HRR work ï¬ow was devel oped as a single tube assay, together with the MASTRReporter software application, to enable data quality con trol, detection of SNPs, indels and CNV/CNAs in the coding regions of 17 selected genes, compromising 1164amplicons, from blood and FFPE derived DNA. The assay is optimized for cost ef ï¬cient use of the NGS capacity and shown to obtain (i) excellent target read mapping (>98%),(ii) uniformity of ampli ï¬cation >96% within 0,2X mean coverage and (iii) low primer dimer (2%). Testing was performed on Illumina âs MiSeq and NextSeq sequencers. Conclusions: The SureMASTR HRR assay is a single plex assay covering 17 most relevant HRR pathway genes, signiï¬cantly reducing the hands on time, DNA input, required sequencing capacity and, in combination with the MASTR Reporter data analysis, to provide an accurate and precise work ï¬ow.

Aggressive digital papillary adeno carcinoma (ADPA) represents a very rare sub entity, thought to arise almost exclusively from sweat glands of theï¬ngers and toes. The aetiology of sweat gland carcinomas and ADPA is largely unknown. ADPAs are most likely driven by somatic mutations. However, somatic mutation patterns are largely unexplored, creating barriersto the development of effective therapeutic approaches to the treatment of ADPA. Objective: To investigate the transcriptome pro ï¬le of ADPA using a sample of eight formalin ï¬xed, paraf ï¬n embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of ADPA and healthy control tissue. Methods: Transcriptome pro ï¬ling was performed using the Affymetrix PrimeView Human Gene Expression Microarray and ï¬ndings were validated via reverse transcription of RNA and real time qPCR. Results: Transcriptome analyses showed increased tumour expression of 2,266 genes, with signi ï¬cant invol vement of cell cycle, ribosomal and crucial cancer path ways. Our results furthermore point to tumour overexpression of FGFR2 (p,0.001). Conclusions: Our results indicate the involvement of crucial oncogenic driver pathways, highlighting cell cycle and ribosomal pathways in the aetiology of ADPA. Sug gested tumour overexpression of FGFR2 raises the hope that targeting the FGF/FGFR axis might be a promising treatment for ADPA and probably for the overall group of sweat gland carcinomas. Currently transcriptome pro ï¬ling is performed in a large sample of eccrine porocarcinoma, the most common sub entity of sweat gland carcinomas.

Arg283Cys) represents a variant of unknown signi ï¬cance. It has been detected as germline and somatic mutation in different cancers, but also in controls. It is also reported in population databases (gnomAD, ExAC)with a low frequency. Using transactivation activity, it has been classi ï¬ed as partially de ï¬cient allele, associated with mild disease course. Material and methods: Aiming to clarify the clinical signiï¬cance of c.847C>T we studied 1061 breast cancer (BC) patients and 1490 controls from the general popula tion. The methodology included multigene panel testing on MiSeq platform and allele speci ï¬c PCR. Results: Compared to the published allele frequencies (0.02%), c.847C>T variant was signi ï¬cantly more common among our BC patients (10/2122 or 0.47%), but also among our controls (10/2980 or 0.34%). The majority of BCpatients carrying c.847C>T mutations had ductal, ER +,P R +, HER2 BC. Seven of the 10 BC patients had familial history for cancer (four of them for BC/OC), but none ofthem met the Li Fraumeni syndrome criteria. Only one patient had co inherited pathogenic mutation in other cancer gene ( BRCA2 c.6937+1G>A) and somatic pathogenic TP53 mutations were identi ï¬ed in two of the four studied breast tumors. Conclusion: Here, we report the highest frequency of TP53 c.847C>T variant, detected among population of R. Macedonia. We further suggest that TP53 c.847C>T mightrepresent a low risk BC allele.

Clonal chromosomal aberrations can be detected in 40 50% or in more than 80% of cases depending on the mitogenic agents used. Thecommon recurrent abnormalities are del(13q)[50%], tris omy 12 [15%], del(11q)[15 20%], del(6q) and del(17p) [5%] and t/der(14)(q32) [4 20%]. Chromosomal transloca tions in CLL are uncommon and most of them occurred within complex karyotypes. OBJECTIVE: To report the translocations identi ï¬ed in patients with CLL diagnosed in three different centers: Hospital ClÃ­nic de Barcelona, Hospital Trias i Pujol de Badalona Hospital del Mar de Barcelona and Consorcio Hospital General Universitario deValencia. Results: Two hundred and thirty one (9%) translocations were identi ï¬ed in 2,543 CLL patients, 172 (74%) balanced and 59 (26%) unbalanced. All chromosomes were found to be involved in translocations, with the single exception of the Y chromosome. The chromosomes most frequentlyinvolved were chromosome 14 (n ,35), 17 (n ,29), 2 (n,24), 1 (n ,21), 3 (n ,13), 5 (n ,12), 8,18 (n ,11) and 10 (n,10). The recurrent translocation most frequently observed was t(14;18)(q32;q21)(n ,28).

Here, we present genetic testing results in our breast cancer (BC) population ful ï¬lling the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) testing criteria with an emphasis on triple negative (TN) cancers. Methods: We analysed 402 consecutive BC cases tested using a multigene sequencing panel. We evaluated mutation detection rates in BC associated genes according to oes trogene/progesterone (ER/PR) and human epidermoidgrowth factor (HER2) receptor status and further subdivided TN (ER /PR /HER2 ) BC patients according to their age at diagnosis and family history of HBOC associated disease. Results: Pathogenic variants (PV) were detected in 81/ 402 (19.9%) BC patients in 6 different genes (54.3% BRCA1 , 18.5% BRCA2 , 11.1% CHEK2 , 8.6% ATM , 6.2% PALB2 and 1.2% TP53) . 17.7% of ER +/PR+/HER2 BC patients carried a PV, 12.0% were BRCA1/BRCA2 positive. In the HER2 +group, 14% were PV carriers âonly BRCA2 variants were seen (6%) with no BRCA1 positive cases. 37.9% of our 87 TN BC patients were PV carriers. Most (29.9%) were BRCA1 positive, followed by PALB2 (3.4%) andBRCA2 (2.3%). TN BC patients with a positive family history (59.8%) were more likely to be BRCA1/BRCA2 positive (38.5% vs. 22.9%).

The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes in CypriotTNBC patients that tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA from 124 TNBC patients was sequenced using the TruSight Cancerpanel (Illumina). We followed the Genome Analysis ToolKit guidelines and all variants were veri ï¬ed by Sanger Sequencing. Rare variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS) were evaluated using in silico pathogenicity prediction algorithms and variants predicted as deleterious, were selected for further investigation. Various tools were used topredict the effect of VUS on protein structure and stability. Results: Five mutations in BC susceptibility genes (PALB2 (4) & TP53 (1)) and ï¬ve mutations in genes not proven to be associated with BC ( ERCC2 (1),ERCC5 (1), FANCL (1) and PRF1 (2)) were found in 10 TNBC patients. In addition, 20 VUS in established and promising BCsusceptibility genes were predicted as deleterious, out of which six were identi ï¬ed in more than one sample ( PALB2 (3),RAD51C (2),BRIP1 (3),CHEK2 (2),ATM (2),PMS2 (3)). Conclusions: In summary, ï¬ve deleterious mutations were identi ï¬ed in ï¬ve Cypriot TNBC patients in established BC susceptibility genes other than the BRCA genes (4.03%). Functional studies, case control association studies and/or co segregation analyses are needed to evaluate the VUS for potential pathogenicity.

30852,"Paragon Genomics, Inc., Hayward, CA, United StatesIntroduction: In the immuno oncology ï¬eld, tumor muta tional burden (TMB) is gaining signi ï¬cant importance with its correlation to patient response to checkpoint inhibitor chemotherapy. TMB is generally calculated using whole exome sequencing using laborious hybrid capture methods. However, targeted sequencing provides better coverage of regions of interest at reduced costs. Here we present CleanPlex Â®technology for TMB analysis, a 4 hour cost effective target enriched NGS library preparation method. We demonstrate excellent performance metrics using a highly multiplexed NGS panel that contains ~20,000amplicons covering 355 genes for TMB assessment. Methods: Input of 20 ng of genomic DNA was used to generate CleanPlex sequencing ready libraries in a 3 stepworkï¬ow combining target enrichment and library pre paration. The protocol includes an ultra high multiplex PCR step to amplify ~20,000 target regions of interest, a back ground cleaning step to remove non speci ï¬c PCR products, and a ï¬nal PCR to add Illumina Â®sequencing adapters and sample indexes. Libraries were sequenced on IlluminaNextSeq Â®platform. Sequencing metrics like on target rates were calculated, and variants were identi ï¬ed using Paragon Genomics âvariant calling algorithm. Results: Using CleanPlex technology, this prototype TMB panel exhibits >95% uniformity at 0.2X mean, limited GC bias, and >94% detection rate for mutants with 5%allele frequencies. CleanPlex background cleaning step is essential and removes undesirable PCR by products. Conclusion: CleanPlex technology is an ultra high mul tiplexed PCR based technology that generates consistent, high quality amplicon libraries with high uniformity, low GC bias, and sensitive variant calling even with ~20,000amplicons and with a work ï¬ow under 4 hours and ideal for TMB analysis.

Previous studies revealed a progressive down regulation of the gene ITIH5 in the course of cervical carcinogenesis. Functional in vitro analyses con ï¬rmed a suppressive effect of ITIH5 on relevant mechanisms for cancer progression in conventional two dimensional cell culture. Aim of the current study is to investigate the in ï¬uence of ITIH5 (with and without use of cytostatics) on different cervical carcinoma cell speci ï¬c 3D tumorspheroid models. Materials and Methods: ITIH5 was ectopically over expressed in SiHa and HeLa cells using retroviral trans duction. Cell line speci ï¬c multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are generated using the hanging drop method. Proliferation , migration , invasion as well as live/dead assays and immunohistochemical analyses are performed toAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1603investigate the in ï¬uence of ITIH5 on MCTS formation before and after treatment with different cytostatics. Results: Functionally, ITIH5 overexpression signi ï¬cantly suppressed tumor spheroid growth and spheroid invasive ness in both, SiHa and HeLa spheroids. Immunohisto chemical analyses revealed a signi ï¬cant reduction in cell proliferation and hypoxia as well as an increase in apoptosis upon ITIH5 overexpression. So far, an altered susceptibility on cervical MCTS to routinely used cytostatic drug treat ment could be not observed. Investigations with novel cytotoxic metal complexes are also ongoing. Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence of ITIH5 possessing tumor suppressive properties in cervical carcinogenesis. Possible effects of ITIH5 itself and on chemotherapy of cervical carcinoma cell lines using 3Dtumorspheroid models may provide a new approach for individualised therapy of cervical cancer in the future.

Several studies have implicated the involvement of FGFR3 and CDKN2A/2B genes in urothelial cancerogenesis. We evaluated the frequency of the most common mutations inthe FGFR3 gene and deletions of the CDKN2A/2B genes in snap frozen tumors from 196 patients (163 males, 33 females) with early stage bladder cancers collectedimmediately after surgery. The methodology included SNaPshot analysis for nine variants in FGFR3 gene (S249C, Y375C, R248C, G372C, A393C, K652E/Q andK652M/T) and MLPA analysis for determination ofdeletions in CDKN2A/2B genes. A total of 65.2% of patients had somatic defects in one of the two analyzed genes of which 18.5% had only a deletion of CDKN2A/2B genes, 24.1% had a mutation in the FGFR3 gene and 22.6% had a combination of both defects. The most common mutation was S249C (32.1%) followed by Y375C (6.5%).No signi ï¬cant difference was found in the distribution of these defects between men and women, whereas a higher frequency of defects were detected in patients >50 (64.6)compared to patients <50 years of age (28.5) (p<0.05). These defects were found with higher frequency in patients with early stage (77.3%) compared to patients with moreadvanced disease (30.0%) (p<0.05). Our results indicate that molecular defects in FGFR3 and/or CDKN2A/2B are important factors in the initiation of the urothelialcancerogeneis in patients with bladder cancer. K.

Pathogenicity of loss of function BAP1 variants is clear, as opposed to missense and regulatory region variants. We sequenced coding,promoter, UTR, and intronic regions of BAP1 and analyzed copy number variations in a nation wide study, enrolling 432 of 533 consecutive Finnish UM patients diagnosedfrom 2010 to 2017, and one Finnish Swedish UM family. We analyzed BAP1 functions necessary for tumor suppres sion using nuclear localization and deubiquitinating activityassays. We found twenty rare variants, and classi ï¬edï¬ve of them as likely pathogenic. Two LOF variants (c.67 +1G>T; c.1780_1781insT) are putative founder mutations, and bothabolished nuclear localization in vitro . The former as well as two heterozygous exon 5 (c.281A>G) and 9 (c.680G>A) missense variants reduced deubiquitinating activity. A deepintronic 25bp deletion in intron 1 caused aberrant splicing in vitro . Based on functional studies and family cancer history, three exon 13 missense variants were classi ï¬ed as benign. No copy number variations were found. Frequency1604of pathogenic variants was 1.9% (95% con ï¬dence interval, 0.8 3.6) overall and 25% among 16 UM families. To establish the pathogenicity of BAP1 variants, family cancer history and functional assays are essential. Pathogenic variants outside BAP1 coding region can cause BAP1 TPDS.

Thus, it is considered an attractive therapeutic target with many drugs being investigated in clinical trials. Materials and Methods: The relative mRNA expression levels of Wnt3 ligand, Frizzled7 receptor, and Î² catenin in 102 samples of colon cancer and 88 samples of breastcancer were determined by RT PCR and the ÎÎCt method. Results: Regarding colorectal carcinomas, increased relative mRNA expression levels of Wnt3 and Frizzled7were found in 60% and 53% whereas decreased mRNA expression levels of Î² catenin were observed in 57% of the cases respectively. Statistically signi ï¬cant linear correlation was observed between the expression of Wnt3 or Frizzled7 andÎ² catenin. In addition, statistical signi ï¬cant correlationwas found between mRNA expression levels of Î² catenin and metastasis in lymph nodes. As far as breast carcinomas are concerned, increased relative mRNA expression levels of Wnt3 and Î² catenin were found in 49% and 24% of carcinomas, respectively. Interestingly, decreased relative mRNA expression levels were observed in Frizzled7 in84% of the cases. Expression levels of Î² catenin were sig niï¬cantly correlated with patients âage and tumour grade, whereas expression levels of Wnt3 were signi ï¬cantly cor related with tumour grade and expression levels of Î² catenin.

We describe a family in which the mother of a child with 18p syndrome showed several different mosaic 18p deletions. Index patient was a 10 year old girl with intellectual disability (IQ 60), ptosis, white matter abnormalities and mild facial dysmorphism. Hermother and two older brothers were healthy but had mild learning disability. SNP array in the girl showed near total loss of 18p (14,7 MB deletion). Chromosome analysis of the mother indi cated a normal karyotype in 20/30 metaphases, with 18p deletion in 10/30 metaphases (33%). Interphase FISH withprobes for the subtelomeric (D18S552, Vysis) and a more proximal region (RP11 620N7, Empire Genomics, maps to18p11.23) revealed a more complex mosaic with two dis tinct cell lines: ~70% of cells carried a microdeletion of the 18p subtelomeric region, and ~30% the large 18p deletion (involving 18p11.23).

30859,"Diminished expression of many antioxidant factors during aging could be responsible for developing of many diseasesassociated with aging. One of the most important scavenger of ROS, with more ef ï¬cient properties than classical antioxidant enzymes, is melatonin. The goal of our studywas to better understand the role of melatonin in the antioxidant defense during aging in extrapineal organs. Since two key enzymes are involved in melatonin synthesis, AA NAT and ASMT, their gene expression was evaluated in the brain, liver, kidney, heart, skin, and intes tine, of 2.5 and 36 months old Wistar rats. Also, as mela tonin might in ï¬uence the expression of antioxidant enzymes, the activity of SOD, CAT, and GSH in liver was estimated. In addition, microelements (Cu, Zn,and Mn)were also measured in liver due to their role in regulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Theï¬nding of signi ï¬cantly increased expression of AA NAT and HIOMT in liver and skin of older animals sug gests that all organs do not age at the same rate. Moreover, the maintaining of antioxidant defense in liver during agingwas con ï¬rmed by our results that the activity of CAT enzyme was signi ï¬cantly higher in older ones, SOD activity was decreased, while in both age groups there were nodifferences in GSH activity. Also, a less amount of micro elements in liver leads to decreased activity of SOD and increased activity of CAT in older animals.1606In all, metabolic products of melatonin, the antioxidant enzymes and microelements in extrapineal organs have an important role in the aging process.

The most common de ï¬ciency allele is the Z allele (Glu342Lys), which causes AAT polymerization and accumulation within the hepatocytes, and predisposes toneonatal hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the reduction of circulating AAT leads to lung tissue damage. Our objective was to studyhepatic disease in organoids from patients with AATD using RNA sequencing technology. Materials and Methods: We have established liver organoids from AATD patients and controls. Organoids are 3D culture systems in which adult stem cells differentiate to specialized cells under the appropriate culture conditions. We have performed RNA sequencing of liver organoids from controls and patients with ZZ genotype with TruSeq â¢ Stranded mRNA (Illumina) using a NextSeq System deIllumina. We have determined differentially expressed genes between control and ZZ organoids and identi ï¬ed the pathways enriched for these genes. Results: The transcriptomic analysis revealed 157 dif ferentially expressed genes in ZZ organoids versus control. Interestingly, a number of genes altered in ZZ organoids areinvolved in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, speci ï¬ cally glucosaminoglycans and glucoesphingolipids.

Some mutations in HBB may produce unstable,abnormal hemoglobins causing (haemolytic) anemia or dominantly inherited Î² thalassemia. Methods: Two unrelated children presented with mac rocephaly and severe congenital anemia. They required stem cell transplantations at ages 2 and 4 without clear diagnosis. Since the parents of both probands had no familyhistory of anemia or abnormal Hb, thalassemia was unsuspected. As genetic testing for variants in genes asso ciated with congenital anemia did not result in an expla nation for the phenotype, whole exome sequencing was performed. Results: We identi ï¬ed two novel, de novo missense stop loss mutations in HBB (c.422T>C and c.422T>A). The mutations identi ï¬ed caused the loss of a stop codon and an elongation of the translated Î² globin chain of 21 amino acids (167 a.a. instead of the usual 146) due to a new stop codon in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the HBB gene. The predicted Î² globin chains were p.(*148Glnext*21) or p.(*148Lysext*21); the latter variant was called HbMokum. Discussion: Using whole exome sequencing, we identi ï¬ed a de novo mutation in two previously undiagnosed children with severe anemia. Both children carry an almost identical heterozygous stop loss mutation in HBB resultingin an elongated Î² globin chain, which most likely produces an unstable hemoglobin. Frameshift mutations in the HBB gene resulting in elongated Î² globin chain have been described before, but resulted in shorter Î² chains (max. 157 a.a.) and milder phenotypes than the mutations described here.

Despite its clinical ef ï¬cacy, chemoresistance to cytarabine is still a common and serious problem in AML therapy. Thepresence of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) within the FLT3 gene confers a worse prognosis in patients with AML; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. An ara C resistant cell line with FLT3 ITD mutation (MV4 11 R) had previously been established. In this study, we aimed to characterize genomic changes for ara C resistancein the MV4 11 R cells. Materials and Methods: Cell growth rate was accessed using counting or MTT assay. Cytogenetic alterations werestudied using traditional G banding and spectral karyotyp ing (SKY) analysis. Gene expressions related to ara C metabolism, such as ENT1 and DCK, were investigatedusing qRT PCR. Results: Firstly, we con ï¬rmed that MV4 11 cells con tained the homozygous FLT3 ITD mutation as previouslyreported. The cell growth rate of MV4 11 R showed dra matically increase to 2.5 fold compared with that of native MV4 11 cells at 96 h culture. Cytogenetic analysis revealedthat resistant and parent cells had a modal number of 47~49 chromosomes. The most prominent differences within them are gain of many structural aberrations in resistant cells. Interestingly, 15% of resistant cells showed tetraploid kar yotypes and acquired additional structural rearrangements. Conclusions: Our data found that the resistant clone MV4 11 R exhibited stronger proliferative activity and more complex karyotype than its parent cells. These results suggest that acquisition of resistance to ara C could beaccompanied by global genomic changes and possibly involved chromosomal instability. J. H. Yen: None. Z. A. Chen: None. L. I.

30863,"Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Endoreduplication is a special type of nuclear polyploidization presented by multiple, uniform copies of chromosomes, more common in plants andinvertebrates. Phenomenon of endoreduplication is related to homeostasis maintenance and tumorigenesis. Endopoly ploid cells are non reproductive, but they may possess thepotential for DNA double strand break repair and ability to delay apoptosis. We have compared endoreduplications induction in lymphocyte cultures from healthy donors andpsoriatic patients treated by the same antiproliferative compound. Materials and Methods: Chromosome aberrations ana lysis was conducted on 100 metaphases per each blood sample and treatment. Lymphocytes were cultivated for 72 h, treated with potential antiproliferative compound, con trols were set as well. In order to test antigenotoxic potential of selected bio ï¬avonoids, they were added in normal lym phocyte cultures after induction of genotoxic effects bytested antiproliferative compound. Results: Results have shown that the antiproliferative compound treatment induces endoreduplications in bothpsoriatic and normal lymphocyte cultures but in different conditions. In lymphocytes from psoriatic patients, endor eduplications occurred after addition of antiproliferativecompound, while the same effect was not observed in normal lymphocytes. We recorded that selected bio ï¬avonoids induce endoreduplications in normal lympho cytes after genotoxic insults of tested compound thereby inhibiting damage progress and reducing genotoxicity. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings show that endoreduplication may be result of genotoxic activity of potential anti proliferative compound in psoriatic patients but not in normal lymphocyte cultures where it may be a potentialmechanism for cell survival.

30864,"Institute of Molecular Biology, So ï¬ a, Bulgaria1608In order to ensure their survivability cells have evolved numerous mechanisms to control their gene expression. These mechanisms have precise time and space temporal regulation. To investigate them our laboratory used a state of art microscopy system which allows long term live cellimaging and a variety of biochemical approaches. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae we excreted the key protein (Dia2) which is part of a modular ubiquitin ligase SCF(Skp1/cullin/F box) that plays a crucial role through normal replication and as well as in the S phase checkpoint activation. Our results show that when this protein ismissing the replication control of the cell is dysregulated and thus the genome expression is destabilized. Further more, the dia2 deletion strand also exhibited very intriguingphenotype regarding its cell cycle progression and protein expression. We have observed the same phenotype in higher eukaryotes when the destabilization of proteins isblocked via an inhibitor (MG132), which inhibits the proteasome. This shows that these mechanisms are universally conserved. We speculate that the protein whichplays the same role in higher eukaryotes is Î²TrCP.

30865,"Austria Introduction: Mutations occurring at increased frequencies in the germline of older men in the FGFR3 gene were suggested to confer a selective growth advantage tospermatogonial stem cells. These mutations have been associated with several congenital disorders. Many more mutations have been reported in FGFR3 for cancer, and it is possible that these expand in the male germline with age. Materials and Methods: To test an age related expan sion of driver mutations, we are screening sperm and testesof different aged donors with two high throughput techni ques: bead emulsion ampli ï¬cation (BEA) and allele speci ï¬c PCR. We are focusing on 13 de novo mutations occurring within a ~3kb region of the FGFR3 , identi ï¬ed in sperm DNA by duplex sequencing (DS) in our laboratory. Results: With our approach, we veri ï¬ed with BEA similar levels of the c.1118A>G mutation in sperm (~1.65x10 5) as measured with DS. We observed an increased mutation frequency with donor âs age in 118 sperm donors of different ages. Moreover, there is a ~5 fold difference between young ( â¤30 years) and middle aged donors (>45 years). Interestingly, analysis of ~30% of one testis from an 80 year old man did not show any high frequency clusters previously observed for other mutationsin the FGFR3 (TDII and ACH). Conclusions: BEA can validate mutations discovered by DS, and more importantly be used for a more detailed andhigh throughput screening of age related expansions of these in the male germline (sperm and testes) to gain further knowledge about the mechanisms in germline mutagenesisand their potential consequences.

Despite not having CDH1 coding mutations, nor in the remaining exome, >50% of HDGC patients present germline mono allelic CDH1 expression, which may indicate a role for CDH1 locus, beyond the coding sequence. We aimed at dissecting the potential role of intronic Cis RegulatoryAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1609Elements (iCREs) in an attempt to identify novel causes of HDGC. Materials and Methods: We performed a bioinformatics analysis based on open chromatin pro ï¬les and prioritized iCRE1 and iCRE8 for further studies. iCREs were cloned in LacZ reporter constructs and integrated into ColA1 locus of mouse embryonic stem cells to generate transgenic mice. Empty vector mice were used as control for ColA1 driven expression. To test tissue speci ï¬cÎ² galactosidase expres sion, endoderm (stomach, esophagus, duodenum, liver), ectoderm (heart) and mesoderm (skin) tissues were dis sected. iCRE8 was sequenced in HDGC probands. Results: While no obvious Î² galactosidase expression was observed for iCRE1 across tissues, in iCRE8 mice embryos, tissue speci ï¬c expression was detected in endodermal derived tissues (stomach, esophagus and duo denum), where E cadherin exerts a primordial function. iCRE8 sequence overlaps several genomic and epigenomicregulatory features, is mutated in one HDGC proband and is being explored by 4C seq and ATAC seq. Conclusion: iCRE8 is likely a CDH1 cis regulatory region important for CDH1 expression in the stomach, and may encompass a novel target for CDH1 deleterious var iants in HDGC patients.

Harteveld1 1LUMC, Leiden, Netherlands,2Reinier de Graaf Groep, Delft, Netherlands Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is a benign condition caused by deletions in the beta globin gene cluster, or by point mutations in the gamma globin gene promoter sequences. In heterozygous carriers, 2 to30% of fetal type of hemoglobin (HbF) continues to be expressed after birth. Offspring of a carrier of a deletiontype of HPFH has an increased risk for a hemoglobinopathy if the partner is carrier of a mutation in the beta globin (HBB) gene, in which mutations are relatively frequent in certain populations. Peripheral complete blood count was performed in a pregnant woman after a bike trauma, including ï¬ow cyto metry and hemoglobin electrophoresis. This excluded feto maternal transfusion but showed a HbF fraction of 15%. Additional testing showed a mosaic (delta beta)0 thalasse mia deletion, identifying the HPFH type 2. This deletion explains the elevated HbF, usually resulting in a HbF fraction of 30%. To con ï¬rm the mosaic deletion, which may explain the lower HbF fraction, SNP array was performed. The mosaic deletion was con ï¬rmed, but surprisingly the B allele frequency plot showed a genome wide complex andpatchy chromosomal pattern which could be explained by genetic chimerism, or alternatively, by an around 50% contamination of the DNA sample with the fetus or a closerelative. Short tandem repeat (STR) marker analysis was per formed and repeated with an independent blood sample. This test con ï¬rmed the genetic chimerism in the patient. Since no Y chromosome contribution was seen, this chi meric state is most probably of no further clinical relevanceto the patient. J. Knijnenburg: None. M. van Zwam: None. K. de Graaff: None. J.

De novo missense mutations inKCNH1 encoding the voltage gated K +channel Eag1 have been identi ï¬ed in a proportion of subjects with ZLS. We report de novo missense variants in KCNN3 in three individuals with typical clinical features of ZLS. KCNN3 (SK3/KCa2.3) constitutes one of three members of the small conductance Ca2+ activated K+(SK) channels that are part of a multiprotein complex consisting of the pore forming channel subunits, the constitutively bound Ca2+ sensor calmodulin, protein kinase CK2 and protein phosphatase 2A. CK2 modulates Ca2+sensitivity of the channels by phosphorylating SK bound calmodulin. Patch clamp whole cell recordings of KCNN3 channel expressingCHO cells demonstrated that disease associated mutations result in gain of function of the mutant channels, character ized by increased Ca 2+sensitivity leading to faster and more complete activation of KCNN3 mutant channels. Pretreatment of cells with the CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7 tetrabromobenzotriazole revealed basal inhibition of wild type and mutant KCNN3 channels by CK2. Analogous experiments with the KCNN3 p. Val450Leu mutant pre viously identi ï¬ed in a family with portal hypertension indicated basal constitutive channel activity and thus a different gain of function mechanism compared to the ZLS associated mutant channels.

Gun Bilgic, S. Cam Manisa Celal Bayar University, Manisa, Turkey Introduction: Ring chromosome 13 is a rare chromosome abnormality in which the ends of chromosome 13 join together to form a ring shape. When a ring forms, there may be missing genes where the chromosome's ends fusetogether. The aim of this study was to investigate the formation of ring 13 chromosomes by cytogenetic and molecular techniques. Methods: Standard conventional cytogenetic method with 72 hour culture was done to peripheral blood lym phocytes. Molecular analysis was performed with sub telomeric FISH and SNP array. Results: A 5 month old baby girl, was borned 2530 gr weight, 36 week, from a couple âs second IVF pregnancy was sent to us with suspicion of chromosomal anomaly. Her parents were the third generation consanguineous. On physical examination, umbilical hernia, VSD, plumpcheeks, depressed nasal bridge, small mouth thin lip, hypoplastic earlobe and tragus, normal genital development were found. According to ISCN 2016, in 30 metaphaseswith G band; 46,XX karyotypes in 3 metaphases; 46,XX,r (13) chromosomes in the other metaphases were found. Normal constitutional karyotypes (46,XY and 46,XX) weredetected in her parents. After G banding, FISH study with 100 nucleus / 20 metaphase and locus speci ï¬c subtelomeric probes showed no deletion in ring chromosomes. The SNParray (illumina 656K) was performed to verify the FISH method, no deletion or duplication was detected. Discus sion:A few de novo ring 13 chromosome familial caseshave been reported in the literature. This is a rare case of individuals with complete ring 13 chromosome who have normal phenotypes and no loss of genetic material. E. Genis: None. A. Aydin Gumus: None. D. Gun Bil gic:None. S.

30870,"University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom Telomere length is associated with atherosclerotic cardio vascular disease and cancer, both of which are leadingcauses of mortality. Recent studies identi ï¬ed genetic variants in seven loci that associate with human leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Many contain genes known to regulate telomere length, e.g. components of the telomere capping SHELTERIN complex or of the telomerase enzyme required for telomere length maintenance. However, someloci contain no candidate, suggesting they may contain genes with previously unidenti ï¬ed roles in telomere biology. Our most recent analysis (unpublished) identi ï¬ed a region containing MPHOSPH6 that associates with LTL at a level of genome wide signi ï¬cance (P<5x10 8). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the LTL associated variants also strongly associate with MPHOSPH6 expression changes, suggesting a link between MPHOSPH6 expression andLTL. MPHOSPH6 is an RNA exosome component and is involved in the maturation of snoRNAs in yeast, therefore we hypothesised MPHOSPH6 could affect LTL throughregulating telomerase RNA (TERC) maturation and con sequently telomerase activity. We reduced MPHOSPH6 expression via siRNA mediated knockdown in HCT116 cells and investigated TERC expression using RT qPCR and telomerase activity using the telomerase repeated ampli ï¬cation protocol assay. Signi ï¬cant reductions of MPHOSPH6 expression (4.61 fold decrease, p<0.01, n ,3) were achieved independently with two siRNAs. This resulted in substantial loss of telo merase activity (4.37 fold decrease, p<0.01, n ,3) and reduction of TERC RNA levels (2.06 fold decrease, p<0.01, n ,3). These data indicate a role for MPHOSPH6 in TERC processing and telomerase activity.

Recently it was shown that PRDM9 forms an active multimer; however, neither the size nor the factors inducing the multimerization are known. Materials and Methods: We performed in vitro binding studies, based on gel shift assays, to infer the size of the protein multimer using DNA fragments that increased in length, containing either one or two speci ï¬c target sites. We tested different protein constructs including truncated pro tein versions, and analyzed the molecular weight and the corresponding migration distance of binding complexes inrelationship to known standards to further determine the protein stoichiometry. Results: We observed that PRDM9 multimerizes to an active trimer which is formed within the repetitive DNA binding ZnF domain and 5 out of 11 ZnF repeats are suf ï¬cient to form the trimer. Moreover, we demonstrated that only one of the ZnF arrays within the trimer contacts the DNA, whereas the remaining two ZnFs likely perform ZnF ZnF interaction to maintain the multimeric conformation. Conclusions: In this work, we report a method using native gel electrophoresis to infer the size, as well as, to investigate the molecular interaction of a multimeric proteinwith DNA. This simple method is suitable especially for proteins with complex structures or repetitive motifs as it is the case for many ZnF proteins. This project was funded by FWF P27698. T. Schwarz: None.

In sepsis, levels of cfDNA correlate with disease severity. The goal of this study was to examine if structural damage in cfDNA ispresent in sepsis patients. Materials and Methods: Samples were collected from nine consenting patients (age 18 +) admitted with severe sepsis to the two ICUÂ´s of Landspitali from December 2016 until May 2017. Samples were also collected from ï¬vehealthy controls. The sample DNA was gently isolated using the Genomic Mini AX kit according to protocol. Northern Lights assay (NLA) was used to detect structural damage in cfDNA such as single/double stranded breaks, bends, and inter/intra strand links. Study was approved by National Bioethics Committee and Icelandic DataAuthority. Results: Damage in cfDNA was observed in all the sepsis patients including: Nicking in double stranded nucleosomalfragments, incomplete degradation of nucleosomal DNA, and lesions causing bending of DNA molecules. Elevated levels of plasma cfDNA were lowered after treatment andcfDNA damage decreased. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the ï¬rst demon stration of cfDNA damage in sepsis patients. Damage incfDNA might re ï¬ect increased damage to DNA or lack of repair associated with cell death prior to release into the bloodstream. Alternatively, these results might re ï¬ect damage to nucleosomal DNA in plasma. Damage in cfDNA might contribute to intense immune stimulation in sepsis patients and be a biomarker for sepsis.

Meta analyses for detectability of sSMC by array comparative genomic hybridization revealed that 81 87% ofthe cases would not have been picked up by exclusive use of this approach. As impaired spermatogenesis is known to be indicative for gross chromosomal anomalies in infertilemale patients, it is obvious from this study that sSMC presence also needs to be considered.

30874,"1University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, United States,2The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada,3University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada ~15% of human tumours use the Alternative Lengthening of Telomere (ALT)mechanism to maintain telomeres. We previously demonstrated that depletion of FANCD2, amember of the BRCA/Fanconi anaemia DNA repair pathway, causes a hyper ALT phenotype. We now extend our analysis to the DNA translocase FANCM and its partnerFAAP24. Weï¬nd siRNA depletion of FANCM or FAAP24 in ALT human cells results in increased replicative stress at telo meres, rapid telomere elongation, and 4 5 fold increases in ECTR DNA number. Importantly, FANCD2 localizes to telomeric foci in FANCM or FAAP24 depleted ALT cells,suggesting that FANCM and FAAP24 protect against telomeric replicative stress independently of other Fanconi anaemia proteins. siRNA depletion of the BLM DNA helicase or the pol Î´ DNA polymerase in ALT cells resulted in telomere short ening and markedly fewer ECTR DNA molecules. Deple tion also suppressed the excessive ECTR production and increased telomere length seen in FANCM and FAAP24 deï¬cient ALT cells, suggesting that these abnormalities are an exaggeration of the ALT phenotype. Our results support models in which failed telomeric replication forks give rise to DNA breaks and gaps used by BLM/pol Î´ dependent break induced replication to drive ALT and produce ECTR DNA. FANCM and FAAP24restrain ALT by preventing collapse of stalled telomeric replication forks. Consequently, loss of FANCM or FAAP24 increases the natural substrate for ALT, failedtelomeric replication forks, which results in a hyper ALT phenotype. As the hyper ALT phenotype is associated with cell death, disruption of the BRCA/Fanconi anemia path way may be a novel treatment strategy for ALT tumours. M. Meyn: None. J. Te: None. M.

We report here a molecular diagnosis of WOREE syndrome that required genome sequencing (GS) to identify the second hit. Material and Methods: Solo exome sequencing (ES) followed by trio GS were performed on a girl presenting with generalized hypotonia, myoclonic epilepsy, ataxia,psychomotor delay, stereotypies, strabismus and cerebral atrophy. Results: After ES, two compound heterozygous missense mutations in SLC30A10 were considered as candidate variations for the disease in this patient and classi ï¬ed of unknown signi ï¬cance. A missense variation (p. Thr12Arg) inWWOX without any other variation in a gene associated with an autosomal recessive encephalopathy did not1614particularly catch our attention at ï¬rst during analysis of ES data. The identi ï¬cation of a second hit was only possible after GS which revealed a complex CNV consisting of two intronic deletions in introns 4 and 5 associated with an inversion of the ï¬fth exon of WWOX. The deletions/ inversion was con ï¬rmed at the genomic level for both intronic junction fragments. RNA studies showed that this intragenic rearrangement resulted in abnormal pre mRNA splicing. Conclusions: GS allowed us to identify the second hit pathogenic variant in a patient heterozygous for a missense variant after ES. This compound heterozygous genotype islikely responsible for the severe epileptic encephalopathy in this patient, a phenotype consistent with a WOREE syn drome.

Theypresent breakpoints that do not disrupt genes related to the phenotype and map within cytobands Xq13 Xq21, from which 80% cluster in Xq21. As deletions within Xq21 donot cause POF, and since different breakpoints and translocation with different autosomes lead to the same phenotype, we hypothesized a âposition effect âas possible mechanism. We ï¬ne mapped the breakpoints in six patients with POF and balanced Xq autosome translocations, established lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients andmatched female controls and pro ï¬led their transcriptome through RNA seq. The 68 genes differentially expressed in the patients âgroup are enriched for genes encoding important proteins for the organization of cell junctions and the immune response. Previous transcriptome studiespinpointed that cellular assembly and maintenance are among the most expressed pathways in ovarian cells. Additionally, GWAS showed that immune pathway related genes were associated with age at normal menopause, allowing to postulate that genes involved in this regulation could also be involved in POF. As the perturbed transcriptsare neither mapping to the X chromosome, nor to the autosome breakpoint, this might indicate that the effect is indirect, and the phenotype is triggered by perturbations ofnormal contacts between genes and their regulatory elements. To further challenge this model, we are currently assessing the chromatin accessibility of the same cell lines. These results should help elucidating the impact of derivative chromosomes repositioning within interphase nuclei. Financial support: FAPESP#2017/20847 9. A. Di Battista: None. M.

30878,"Israel Introduction: Whole exome sequencing (WES) revolutio nized the ï¬eld of Human Genetics with a quick and accurate method to identify disease causing variants, with diagnostic rates of approximately 25 50%. Whole genome sequencing(WGS) improves the diagnostic rate, but not dramatically, mainly due to an interpretation gap, yet to be closed. RNAseq was suggested as a complementary method,allowing direct observation of the transcriptome and the identi ï¬cation of missplicing events derived from deep intronic or coding sequences variants, that are dif ï¬cult to interpret, even when identi ï¬ed with WES or WGS. Although RNAseq was proved to improve diagnostic yield, the need to obtain RNA from the relevant disease tissue isan obstacle to implementing it as a clinical method. Methods: 56 cases of varied phenotypes were tested by PCR for speci ï¬c gene missplicing or abnormal expression in RNA extracted from lymphocytes. Most cases were identi ï¬ed with WES, where a splice variant was suspected. Results: 27%(15/56) of tested genes were not expected to be expressed in whole blood according to the GTEx data base, but only in 5%(3/56) cases we were not able to detect a transcript. 23 case (41%) validated the disease causing variant, resulted in misspliced transcripts. Conclusions: The cases validated with RNA extracted from lymphocytes included developmental delay, hypoto nia, ataxia and other phenotypes not involving the circu lating system, demonstrating the feasibility of detectingaberrant splicing events in an accessible tissue, suggesting that improving the ability to detect rare transcripts with RNAseq, will allow this method to serve as a clinicaldiagnostic tool.

30879,"repetitive sequences have long proven challenging for targeted enrichment methods, as they rely upon some formof ampli ï¬cation. Similarly, most DNA sequencing technol ogies struggle to faithfully sequence regions of low complexity. This has especially been trying for repeatexpansion disorders such as Fragile X disease, Huntington disease and various Ataxias, where the repetitive elements range from several hundreds of bases to tens of kilobases. We have developed a robust, ampli ï¬cation free targeted enrichment technique, called No Amp Targeted Sequen cing, that employs the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In conjunctionwith SMRT Sequencing, which delivers long reads spanning the entire repeat expansion, high consensus accuracy, and uniform coverage, these previously inacces sible regions are now accessible. This method is completely ampli ï¬cation free, therefore removing any PCR errors and biases from the experiment. Furthermore, this techniquealso preserves native DNA molecules, allowing for direct detection and characterization of epigenetic signatures. The No Amp method is a two day protocol that is compatiblewith multiplexing of multiple targets and multiple samples in a single reaction, using as little as 1 Î¼g of genomic DNA input per sample. We have successfully targeted a numberof repeat expansion disorder loci ( HTT,FMR1 ,ATXN10 , TCF4 ,C9orf72 ) with alleles as long as >2700 repeat unites (>13 kb). Using the No Amp method we have isolatedhundreds of individual on target molecules, allowing for reliable repeat size estimation, mosaicism detection and1616identi ï¬cation of interruption sequences all aspects of repeat expansion disorders which are important for better understanding the underlying disease mechanisms.

High quality analyses require high quality pheno type data and well de ï¬ned disease endpoints. Since 1992 the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has systematically collected DNA samples from allparticipants of its health examination surveys. These samples have now been processed, and vast amounts of genomic data is available to researchers through THLBiobank. Materials and Methods: THL Biobank collections include genetic data from >10 Finnish study cohorts. Cur rently the collections include: GWAS chip data N>74,000, of which >50,000 imputed in the FinnGen project to a high coverage population speci ï¬c reference panel (N>100,000 reached within a year); WES N>12,500; WGS N>2,000; methylation data N>500; gene expression data N>550. All study participants can be followed up (for up to 25 years)from national registers for disease endpoints and drugpurchases, and the vast majority has wide availability of questionnaire and laboratory variables. Additionally, there are cells available for >10,000, RNA for >3,000 and NMR metabolomics for >40,000 of these. Results and Conclusions: THL Biobank data is available for research use for researchers and companies worldwide. Since 2015, 98 biobank projects have been initiated, including interesting projects ranging from pharmacoge nomics and returning genetic data to study participants tocardiovascular and cancer research. Of the biobank pro jects 93% (91/98) have included genomic data, thus genetic data is of high interest for researchers seeking biobankmaterial. A. Joensuu: None. K. Silander: None. M. Perola: None.

30881,"Infrastructure (NGI), Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden Introduction: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) com bined with bisul ï¬te conversion is the gold standard technique for interrogation of DNA methylation levels. However, sample preparation for whole genome bisul ï¬te sequencing (WGBS) is challenging due to the side effects of the bisul ï¬te treatment causing DNA strand breakage and single strandedness. We recently developed Splinted Ligation Adapter Tagging (SPLAT), a sensitive library preparation method for WGBS (Raine et al, 2017, NAR).To evaluate platform related bias, we have evaluated SPLAT in comparison with commercial WGBS library preparation kits on different Illumina platforms (Raine et al,2018, PLoS One). Materials and Methods: We have optimized the SPLAT protocol for preparing sequencing libraries from samplescontaining low quantities of single stranded DNA or mix tures of single/double stranded DNA. This includes samples of ultra low input (picograms) and direct WGBS librarypreparation from cells. Results and Conclusion: We show that SPLAT is a fast simple and cost ef ï¬cient library preparation method that produces sequencing libraries of high complexity, uniform genome coverage and compares favorably to commercial WGBS kit. Moreover, SPLAT can be applied to low (andAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1617ultra low) levels of DNA and may be useful for cell free (liquid biopsy) DNA library preparation.

Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 64 cervical swab specimens from healthy women. And an NGS based work ï¬ow was designed using the MGICare BRCA1/2 multiplex PCR amplicon libraries followed byMGISEQ 2000RS sequencer. A reference BRCA1/2 mutation dataset from whole genome sequencing (WGS) of these samples was used to assess detection performance. Results: Total 680 BRCA1/2 benign variants were found in these swab specimens and the consistency with WGS data was 99.41% (671 in 675 reference BRCA1/2 muta tions). The same reference variant (chr13, 32912299, T>C, 50%) from four samples not detected by multiplex PCR NGS was with low sequencing depth (7x, 12x, 19x, and19x, respectively) in WGS data and it does not exist con ï¬rming by Sanger sequencing. Another 9 real BRCA1/2 variants detected by multiplex PCR NGS were also veri ï¬ed by Sanger sequencing. No pathogenic mutations were found in these healthy women.

The high sensitivity of NGS allows the detection and accurate quanti ï¬cation of variants showing low variant fractions (VFs). In 11 index patients with familial breastand/or ovarian cancer, NGS analysis of blood derived DNA identi ï¬ed 11 distinct deleterious variants (IARC class 4/5) with unusually low VFs of 10 30%. These were found infour established cancer predisposition genes (7x TP53 , 2xCHEK2 ,1 x BRCA1 and 1x MSH2 ). Complementary NGS analysis of DNA derived from tumour or non diseased tissue (available from 8 of 11 patients) con ï¬rmed three variants (2x TP53 ,1 x BRCA1 ). Inheritance of the deleterious mutation to the offspring was seen in the caseof the BRCA1 positive patient. The ï¬ve remaining variants (3xTP53 ,2 xCHEK2 ) were absent in the complementary tested tissue and therefore may be blood speci ï¬c. One likely scenario for the occurrence of these variants is chemotherapy induced clonal hematopoiesis, as recently shown for TP53 . In line with this hypothesis, four of the ï¬ve patients (3x TP53 ,1 xCHEK2 ) received chemotherapy (carboplatin) prior to blood draw. In summary, variants with low VFs may be due to somatic mosaicism (e.g. clonalhematopoiesis) or mosaics affecting germline. These data indicate that VFs needs to be considered in the interpreta tion of NGS results and variants with low VFs need to beconï¬rmed in independent tissues. This can provide insights into the cause of the tumor disease and possible heredity of mutations to provide the patient with accurate counseling. M. Larsen: None. K. Keupp: None. K.

30884,"University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany The amount of somatic variants in cancer, the tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been associated with positive outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in several cancer entities. Distinguishing somatic variants from highlevels of germline variants or sequencing artifacts can be accomplished by sequencing a matched normal sample from the same individual, which is often not available inroutine diagnosis. While raw variant calls can be ï¬ltered for germline variants by population frequency in public databases, sequencing artifacts are speci ï¬c to wet lab methodology. We employed standard open source software for alignment (bwa) and variant calling (GATK4 mutect2) combined with a one on one artifact ï¬ltering different to GATK's best practices. Variants in in the tumor were directly compared to the alignments of a panel of normals rather than being called in each sample and then combinedin a vcf ï¬le which then serves as a blacklist. We estimated TMB on a custom gene panel of ~1GB coding exons and compared results of 9 samples to several sequencing panelsand software solutions of commercial vendors. Our approach showed different levels of correlation with tested alternative solutions, peaking R^2 ,0.995 (Illumina TSO500) and R^2 ,0.959 (QIAseq TMB Panel).

Zheng11Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States,2Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA, United States Clinical oncology samples are often limited in quality and quantity, making NGS based detection of pathologicvariants challenging. Sensitive and accurate detection of low frequency variants can be accomplished using hybrid capture and ultra deep targeted sequencing, but rely on highconversion during library construction. Size selection is required to remove adapter dimers resulting in signi ï¬cant sample loss and reduced sensitivity to low frequencyvariants. Speci ï¬city also suffers as many low frequency artifacts arise during sample preparation and hybrid capture. Duplexed molecular barcoding can eliminate these artifacts,but conventional duplexed adapters are dif ï¬cult to synthe size and purify, leading to reduced ligation ef ï¬ciency. We present the IDT library preparation kit optimized for low input and degraded samples. Our chemistry relies on a proprietary engineered DNA ligase and sequencing adapters that prevent chimeras and suppress dimer formation negat ing the need for size selection. We adopted the work ï¬ow for both DNA and RNA applications and demonstrated efï¬cacy using diverse sample types. To assess sensitivity, we created libraries using mixtures of genome in a bottle gDNA and performed hybrid capture using a custom panel targeting single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy numbervariants (CNVs), and gene fusions. When compared to commercially available methods, our approach yielded a 1.5 to 4 fold increase in library complexity with improvedsensitivity to <0.25% variants using 1 25 ng cfDNA, and <0.5% using 25 250 ng FFPE DNA. RNA libraries were constructed from FFPE NGS reference standards to evaluatefusion detection. Our method provides superior sensitivity and speci ï¬city for detection of low frequency variants, even with highly degraded DNA and RNA. U. Das Chakravarty: A.

Both NGS and Sanger sequencing are PCR based methods, Sanger sequencing isused to verify NGS results. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the incidence of ADO reducing the diagnostic yield in primary cardiomyopathy genetic testing viasemiconductor NGS and Sanger sequencing of target gene panels. Methods: We have developed 3 AmpliSeq custom gene panels for mutational screening: âK +/Na+ion channels â, âDesmosomal proteins â,âSarcomeric proteins â, contains 1049 primer pairs (37 genes) totally, 152 kb. About 140probands were screened with at least one of these gene panels. AmpliSeq sequences were analyzed in silico and visually compared with Sanger control sequences, notingthe facts of heterozygosity loss. Results: We have detected 12 ADO cases both in Sanger (5 cases) and AmpliSeq (7 cases) sequencing data. All ADOevents happened due to frequent or rare SNVs in the oli goprimer annealing sites and were detected due to mismatch in frequent SNPs zygosity nearby. Three pathogenic var iants would be missed if were not revealed by re sequencing with alternative method and alternative oligos. Conclusion: All PCR based methods have a risk of ADO leading to a decrease of diagnostic yield of genetic testing. ADO can theoretically affect 1% amplicons. It seems that real scope of ADO might be much higher and depends onnumbers of primer pairs. The software for ADO detection is needed. This work was supported by RNF grant â16 15 10421. A.

These assays are typically insensitive to 2 ciscopies ofSMN1 on one chromosome and none on the other; a scenario which accounts for 8% 29% of carrier states, depending on ethnicity. Thus, we established a new pan ethnic assay to improve cisallele carrier detection. Materials and Methods: 96 Jewish subjects, from var ious countries of origin across 4 continents were selected forstudy. An established qPCR assay was performed on all samples to assay SMN1 exon7 dosage. Subsequently, a 16kb region, encompassing SMN1 /2 exon 7 and ï¬anking polymorphic SNP sites, was PCR ampli ï¬ed from each sample with barcoded primers for SMRT sequencing on a Sequel System (Paci ï¬c Biosciences). Consensus reads were uniquely mapped to either SMN1 orSMN2 and c.840C>T status was independently determined. Finally, SMN1 exon 7 dosage was validated by a commercial MLPA kit (MRCHolland). Results: The combined qPCR and long read amplicon analysis correctly identi ï¬ed the allelic state of 95 samples passing quality control. Interestingly, SMN1 >SMN2 gene conversion events were identi ï¬ed in both a zero copy and an unrelated 1 copy carrier. In addition, SMN2 >SMN1 gene conversion events were also detected in 3 ciscarrier con trols and 3 other unrelated 3 copy individuals. None of the gene converted samples were of the same ethnicity.

Molecular genetic testing of the associated CFTR gene is routinely performed in standard clinical care. During a validation process of ourmassively parallel sequencing (MPS) results, we identi ï¬ed a region around exon_10 that was found to be particularly prone to speci ï¬c sequencing errors. Material and Methods: MPS data were generated using different sequencing panels on Illumina MiSeq/NextSeq platforms. Read mapping and variant calling was performedusing Bowtie2 and Vardict, respectively. Genotyping of the TG n/Tnmotif was performed using Dante, an alignment free STR genotyping tool. Exon_10 and surrounding intronicregions were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: We identi ï¬ed several types of false variants in this region. One group was found to be caused by a highlyhomologous but not fully matching region in chromosome 20. Since this region was not present in GRCh37, corre sponding reads were attracted by the CFTR gene creating thus false variant calls. Using GRCh38 these variants dis appeared. The same homologous region caused problems also to our STR genotyping tool which detected an addi tional TG/T allele. Another group was found to be typically associated to sequencing reads directly spanning the intro nic TG n/Tnpolymorphic locus. These were associated to larger repeat numbers and had their origin in repeat induced sequencing errors. Conclusion: The mentioned CTFR region revealed ï¬nd ings worth of investigations, possibly having implications for another genomic regions too. Such error sources should be kept in mind when evaluating variants and consideringadditional validation analyses. Supported by: VaV_MZSR_2018/46 SAV 5 and VEGA_1/0433/19. Z. Kubiritova: None. J.

Diagnostic yield was 42% overall (78/186 cases), reaching >60% for Neurode velopmental, Skeletal/connective tissue, Skin, Ears/Eyes; 56cases exhibited autosomal dominant inheritance (49 de novo, 7 inherited), 12 recessive and 10 X linked, including35 known, 47 novel variants (submitted to ClinVar) and 8 variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS). Discussion: NGS supports marked improvement in diagnostic yield for many RDs, sometimes revealing aty pical phenotypes and/or genotypes. Higher diagnostic yield is achieved for clinically well de ï¬ned cases, supported by family segregation studies. Close collaboration between the laboratory and clinics, supports high quality standards (clinical, laboratory, interpretation, counselling/reporting),fundamental to optimise de ï¬nitive diagnosis, although VUS remain challenging.

Genetic diagnosis provides potential for etiologically based management and treatment. Existing research has focused on early onset (<2 years) epilepsies while dataregarding later onset epilepsies is limited. Program goals: Determine, in a selected pediatric epilepsy cohort, the overall and actionable molecular diagnostic (MDx) yieldand the CLN2 disease MDx yield. CLN2 is a severe, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease with onset of seizures at/after 2 years and average age of diagnosis of5 years. Methods: Blueprint Genetics ânext generation sequen cing (NGS) based 283 gene epilepsy panel was used. Copynumber variant (CNV) detection from NGS data was included. Variant interpretation was performed according to ACMG guidelines. Program results (Oct/2017 Nov/2018)are reported from 210 patients (Europe, Middle East) with inclusion criteria: Age 24 60 months, ï¬rst seizure at/after 24 months, and at least one additional ï¬nding. The program was sponsored by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. Results: Median age at testing: 42 months; median age of ï¬rst seizure onset: 30 months; average delay from ï¬rst seizure to comprehensive genetic testing: 10.3 months. Genetic diagnosis was established in 42 patients; 20.0%Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1623MDx yield.

We present a patient with acute myeloidleukemia (AML) incidentally diagnosed by CMA done on peripheral blood. A nine years old boy of consanguineous parents was referred to CMA because of multiple CALspots with axillary freckling, and severe failure to thrive (weight and height: 3.5SD, head circumference: 4SD). At age four years he had Wilms tumor, with a relapse at agesix. Former genetic workup included normal karyotype, methylation pattern of H19 and NF1 sequencing. SNP based CMA testing revealed multiple changes in mosaicstate: mosaic duplications of 1q, 3q, 6p, 21q, 11q, 21q, mosaic loss of 6p, and mosaic copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN LOH) of 10q, 19q, 21q, with multiplehomozygous regions (22%). This CMA result indicated hematological malignancy, later diagnosed as therapyrelated AML. Peripheral blood karyotype detected multiple spontaneous chromosomal changes, including: single and double strand breaks, quadri radial structures, marker chromosomes and translocations. Diepoxybutane induced breakage test did not indicate increased breakage. Bone marrow karyotype showed 6p deletion, partial trisomy of11q, mosaicism for del5q, consistent with t AML. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous missense mutation in BLM (c.3416G>C), indicating Bloom syn drome, explaining the clinical presentation. Here we demonstrate that in addition to diagnosis of deletion/ duplication syndromes, mosaicism and CN LOH, the useof SNP based CMA platforms allows detection of pre viously undiagnosed systemic maladies.

30894,"United Kingdom Introduction: Genotyping experiments by the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) have identi ï¬ed more than 100 loci associated with the risk of breast cancer. Rare deletions and duplications within susceptibility genes are known to increase breast cancer risk but the contribution of rare CNVs within other genes and non coding regionshas not been studied with large sample sizes. Materials and Methods: We called CNVs from the intensity measurements from Illumina custom arrays(iCOGS and Oncoarray) for ~150,000 breast cancer cases and ~120,000 controls. To reduce noise we applied a principal component adjustment to the intensities and strictsample and locus quality control. We calculated z scores from the distribution of intensities at each probe and used circular binary segmentation to identify runs of probeswhere the z scores for a sample were shifted. We derived cut offs for the mean z scores of segments that indicated probable deletions or duplications. Results: Comparison with known rare CNVs in 1000 Genomes samples indicate a sensitivity rate of approxi mately 86% for deletions and 71% for duplications. Weestimated the rate of false positive CNV calls to be around 7% for deletions and 16% for duplications. The z scores1624provide a metric for the con ï¬dence of the CNV call. Tests for breast cancer risk showed the strongest associations for known CNVs in CHEK2 and BRCA1. Conclusions: By accounting for the variance in probe intensity on genotyping arrays, our method improves the calling of rare CNVs and may provide more powerful testsof disease association. J. G.

Simple targeted methods are required for their con ï¬rmation and segregation analysis. We developed a simple and universal CNV assay based on dPCR and universal Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) hydro lysis probes. Methods: We analyzed the mapping of the 90 LNA hydrolysis probes from the Roche Universal Probe Library (UPL). For each CNV, selection of the optimal primers andLNA probe is almost automated, probes are reused across assays and each dPCR assay includes the CNV amplicon and a reference amplicon. We assessed the assay perfor mances on 93 small and large CNVs and performed a comparative cost ef ï¬ciency analysis. Results: UPL LNA probes presented nearly 20,000,000 occurrences on the human genome and were homo geneously distributed with a mean interval of 156 bp. The assay accurately detected all the 93 CNVs, except one(<200 pb), with variation coef ï¬cients below 10%. The assaywas shown to be more cost ef ï¬cient than all the other methods. Conclusion: The universal dPCR CNV assay is simple, robust and cost ef ï¬cient as it combines a straightforward design allowed by universal probes and endpoint PCR, the advantages of a relative quanti ï¬cation of the target to the reference within the same reaction, and the high speci ï¬city of the LNA hydrolysis probes.

Faas1 1Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, Netherlands,2Maastricht UMC +, Maastricht, Netherlands Introduction: Nowadays, in fetuses with structural abnormalities, rapid whole exome sequencing (WES) is frequently performed in addition to routine diagnostics tests (QF PCR and microarray analysis). Since our in housediagnostic work ï¬ow now allows for prenatal WES results within two weeks, we evaluated whether genome wide, exome based CNV analysis on prenatal samples with a non aberrant QF PCR result is suf ï¬ciently robust and accurate to replace the current microarray work ï¬ow. Methods: For all samples received between 01/2016 and 10/2018 for which both rapid WES and microarray analysis were performed, aberrant microarray pro ï¬les explaining the ultrasound abnormalities were compared to exome basedCNV pro ï¬ling data. In addition, for all clinically relevant CNVs reported in the prenatal setting in 2018, the potential detection of these using exome sequencing data, based onCNV size and/or gene content, was investigated. A total of 21 clinically relevant CNVs (with sizes ranging from 500 kb â8.7 Mb) were examined. Results: Exome based CNV analysis detected 21/21 of the investigated chromosomal aberrations, includingAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1625recurrent pathogenic CNVs such as the 22q11 microdele tion. The advantage of simultaneously detecting both SNVs and CNVs by WES is underscored by a fetus in which a paternal 1q21.1 microdeletion and a maternal SNV in the RBM8A gene were identi ï¬ed, resulting in autosomal recessive TAR syndrome. Conclusions: Our results show that exome based CNV proï¬ling can detect clinically relevant copy number varia tions in prenatal samples that are also identi ï¬ed by micro array analysis.

However abnormal CNVs are a cause of numerous genetic disorders. Several methods for CNV analysis are used, fromthe conventional cytogenetic analysis through microarray based methods (aCGH) to next generation sequencing. We present GenomeScreen NGS based CNV detectionmethod. Materials and Methods: A previously described CNV detection algorithm used for NIPT was adjusted to allowreplacement of aCGH for whole blood or buffy coat. We determined theoretical limits of its accuracy and con ï¬rmed it with extensive in silico study as well as genotypedsamples. Results: When using WGS achievement of theoretical limit for Z score of >7, at least 3M uniquely mapped readsare required to detect deviation with the length of 200k bases or more. This ï¬nding is supported both with the in silico analysis and analysis on lab prepared samples. In bothanalyses we were able to detect all of the simulateddeviations with length of at least 200k and even some with smaller length (between 100k and 200k). Conclusions: We compared clinical samples de ï¬ned by aCGH method in Slovakia (Human Genome CGH Micro array Kit, 4x44K), which has roughly 200k bases resolu tion. This resolution is in line with GenomeScreen. Thedisadvantage of the aCGH method are huge gaps longer than 200k bases leaving 38% of genome uncovered, whereas only 13% is uncovered when GenomeScreen isused (mainly centromeres).

Interpretation of results is based on correct evaluation of the extent and clinical signiï¬cance of each detected variant. Due to low population frequency of many benign variants, we decided to explore a new concept application of CNV detection for distant relatedness determination. We analysed a large four generation pedigree without any genetic impairment, we followed the segregation of CNVs and reproducibility of their calls. Materials and Methods: We tested the performance of Agilent Sure Print G3 Human Microarray 2x 400K. We isolated DNA from saliva using Oragene technology. Agi lent Male and Female Control DNAs were used. Results: We compared 27 pairs of ï¬rst degree relatives, 12 pairs of ï¬rst cousins, 12 pairs of âuncle nephew typeâ(r,1/4), 4 pairs of double ï¬rst cousins and 15 pairs of second cousins. We followed three times the segregation from a common ancestor to the fourth generation and fourtimes to the third generation. Typically we detected around 30 CNVs per individual and we followed the segregation with high precision (identical genomic coordinates for theanalysed CNV in different individuals).1626Conclusions: In our pilot study, we provided the evi dence that a microarray with evenly distributed probes is able to detect segregation of CNVs with high reproduci bility across four generations and that more ef ï¬cient CNV detection algorithm based on WGS and appropriate popu lation data may represent a handy tool for distant related ness determination.

We assessed the performances of CNV calling using CANOES, a read depthcomparison method applied to gene panels and whole exome sequencing (WES). Methods: We applied CANOES to NGS data obtained from (i) 465 samples with both gene panel and compre hensive Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluoresent (QMSPF) data available (total of 60 exons assessed), (ii) 95additional samples with NGS data from 2 different gene panels, (iii) 135 samples with both WES and array CGH (aCGH) data available and (iv) 1,056 additional WES. Results: From the gene panel data, CANOES detected all 14 events that were previously identi ï¬ed by QMPSF, withneither any false positive nor any false negative among 465 samples (Sensitivity (Se) ,speciï¬city,100%). In addition, CANOES detected 97 candidate CNVs in 95 additional samples, 86 of which were con ï¬rmed by a tar geted technique (PPV ,90.1% overall). From the WES data, CANOES detected 159 of the 195 exonic eventspreviously detected by aCGH among the 135 samples with WES+aCGH data available (Se ,81.5%). Overall, the PPV of CANOES from WES data was 94.8% after the con ï¬rmation of 108 of the 123 calls targeting a list of 355 genes among 1,056 additional patients.

Torrents Reference Laboratory, Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona), Spain Objectives: Despite the great advances achieved in clinical genetics enabled by the incorporation of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), a signi ï¬cant percentage of patients with genetic diseases still do not have a conclusive molecular diagnosis. The incorporation of speci ï¬c pipeline bioinfor matic methods has allowed the implementation of CopyNumber Variants (CNVs) detection in NGS analysis, improving its diagnostic ef ï¬ciency. In this study, the clinical utility of the detection of CNVs by NGS has beenproven. Materials and Methods: During 2018, 275 patients were studied using the NGS technique without obtaining an accurate genetic diagnosis. Bioinformatic tools that compare the normalized sequencing depth between patients and controls were used to determine CNVs. The results obtained were comparedwith patients owns laboratory database. CNVs were con ï¬rmed by Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Ampli ï¬ca tion (MLPA). Results: Pathogenic CNVs causing the disease were detected in 11 out of the 275 patients (4%). Speci ï¬cally, CNVs were detected for pathologies with autosomaldominant inheritance patterns ( TSC2 ,MSH2 andFBN1 ), as well as for genes with autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, including two homozygous deletions ( KCNV2 and RDX ) and one heterozygous deletion with a Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) in the PKHD1 gene. One of the most notable cases corresponds to a patient suspected ofhypomagnesemia who showed compound heterozygous deletions in the TRPM6 gene. Conclusion: These results con ï¬rm that the inclusion of the detection of CNVs by NGS in the genetic diagnostic routine allows to increase the diagnostic ef ï¬ciency offered, obtaining increasingly signi ï¬cant results and with a better cost effectiveness than conventional techniques.

De ï¬ciencies in the baseline truth set will result in misleading performance metrics. In this work,1628we evaluated the preliminary benchmark deletions pub lished by the genome in a bottle consortium (GIAB) for the reference sample NA12878. Methods: We used orthogonal data from Illumina SNP array, Illumina short read sequencing and long read sequencing data from PacBio and Nanopore to manuallyreview every deletion greater than 1kb in size. To assess the presence of each deletion call, we computed the relative read depth across the deletions compared to the rest of thegenome, evaluated paired end, and split reads supporting the deletion call. Results: There were 610 deletions (>1kb) in the pre liminary benchmark dataset published by the GIAB. Fifteen percent of the deletions (94/610) were found to be LINE insertions in the reference genome falsely identi ï¬ed as deletions in the NA12878. Sixteen percent of the dele tions (98/610) had con ï¬icting evidence across datasets. We saw evidence for 69% of the deletions (423/610) acrossdatasets.

This fusion restricts normal growth of the skull, face and brain causing a number of neurological and neurosurgical complications. Craniosynostosis can be isolated or syn dromic. Syndromic craniostenosis is usually caused by a genomic imbalance or de ï¬cit although the exact mechanism oftenly remains unknown. Array based comparative geno mic hybridization (array CGH) is a powerful and high resolution approach for detection of DNA copy number variants (CNVs).Materials and Methods: The genome pro ï¬ling of forty two patients with syndromic craniosynostosis was carried out by oligo array CGH. Agilent ISCA, 4x44, v2.0, with 35 kbp backbone resolution were used. The slides were scan ned on Agilent ï¬uorescent scanner G2505C and analyzed by BlueFuse Multi, v 4.2 (20289) (BlueGnome,Cambridge, UK). Results: We found ï¬ve pathogenic rearrangements con sisting of: three deletions (ranging from 1.1 to 11.24 Mb)and two duplications (ranging from 14.92 to 25.19 Mb).

The cells were lysed and used directly in the QuantiGene â¢4 plex assay. Readings were taken on the Luminex Â®200â¢and MAGPIX Â®instruments. Results: The assay gave linear readings (R 2â¥0.99) for the genes expressed by each cell line down to a mean limit of26 cells (range: 6 58). KRT19 outperformed EPCAM as epithelial biomarker. The mesenchymal, triple negative cell line Hs578T expressed only FN1, which maintained a linear signal down to only 6 cells. In the HER2 positive cell lines, ERBB2 was an excellent biomarker, even in JIMT 1, which is known to be a low expresser. High concordance(R 2â¥0.87) was recorded between the two instruments. Conclusion: Direct cell lysis and signal ampli ï¬cation technology make bead based multiplex RNA panelsapplicable on liquid biopsies in the clinical laboratory. The technique is being currently optimized with the use ofupstream, antibody independent CTC enrichment methods for its application in patient liquid biopsy specimens. J. Scerri: None. S.

30906,"Liquid biopsy, the analysis of cell free DNA released by tumor cells into plasma, is becoming a promising biomarker in clinical oncology. Potential applications include: opti mizing therapy (e.g. detecting resistance), monitoringresidual disease, appraising tumor mutation burden, and early detection of relapses. Yet, this analysis is technically challenging, largely because the minute amounts ofcirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) often require detecting mutations at frequencies lower than 1%. Molecular tags are a recent technical improvement allowing to better distin guish low frequency mutations from sequencing noise. With the aim of implementing novel diagnostic tests in our hospital, we systematically compared two leadingcommercial systems for molecular tags libraries: Avenio (Roche) and QiaSeq (Qiagen), both with synthetic control DNA (Horizon) and with DNA from patients with lung orcolon carcinoma. Our comparison included a set of 12 cases of colorectal cancer for which we compared sequencing of liquid biopsies with that of the initial tumors. Overall, therewas excellent agreement between the two ctDNA sequen cing techniques, but poor correlation with the initial tumor, likely due to tumor evolution during the delay betweensurgery and liquid biopsy. Dilution experiments revealed excellent linearity of detection, with a lower limit of quanti ï¬cation around 0.2%. Repeatability and reproduci bility were good. A key factor was bioinformatic analysis, and dedicated software proved superior to generic open source programs. In conclusion, both ctDNA sequencing systems proved equally good and provided sensitivities in the 10 3range, thus approaching the theoretical limit that can be expectedgiven the low amount of ctDNA in plasma.

We applied 3 step approach using known molecular methodsfor fast mutation search, which helped physicians quickly start appropriate neonatal treatment. Materials and Methods: gDNA from 501 dried blood spots (DBS) obtained using column extraction; high reso lution melting (HRM) analysis performed using âPrecision Melt Software â(Bio Rad); Sanger sequencing, MLPA performed on âGenomeLab GeXP â(Beckman Coulter) according to manufacturers âprotocols. Results: We applied 3 step approach (HRMA Sanger MLPA) for all suspicious CF cases after NBS. In 2016 2018 we studied 401 samples and revealed 34 carriers with one CFTR mutation and 17 children (later included in regional CF registry) with two mutations. First we looked for seven major regional mutations using HRM based genotyping, then HRM based gene scanning revealed exonswith deviating melting patterns, which in turn were sub jected to Sanger sequencing. Finally, MLPA was used for all samples. All ï¬ndings (see Table) were validated later with 100% concordance by NGS performed elsewhere. This study also updated the list of major regional CFTR mutations. Conclusions: the proposed approach allowed to perform CFTR mutation testing rapidly (TAT 3 4 days) for neo natal DBS samples at level of regional genetics laboratory,which is particularly important for new CF cases among scattered population in Siberia.

To monitor the ability of molecular laboratories to detect MCADD and CFmutations from neonatal blood spot cards, an external quality assessment (EQA) was set up in 2008. For these EQAs, samples are distributed four times a year to providecontinual monitoring of the quality of testing. To mimic the newborn screening carried out in laboratories as closely as possible, routine neonatal bloodspot cards are used with realpatient blood samples. For the CF EQA a variety of different CF variants are tested including the four most common European CFTR variants (p. Phe508del, p. Gly542*, p. Glu551Asp and c.621 +1G>T).

In a diagnostic set up, comprehensiveanalysis of all molecular cytogenetic aberrations in a given sample still requires a combination of techniques, such as CNV microarrays, karyotyping and FISH. We hypothesizethat the combination of classical approaches could be largely replaced by novel optical mapping technology. We had early access to the new SaphyrDC system (Bio Nano Genomics), which enables SV detection based on optical mapping of labeled high molecular weight DNA. We performed optical mapping with >100X genome cov erage to detect cytogenetic aberrations in 4 leukemia sam ples and compared the results with those obtained using classical methods. In all samples, a very good concordancewith the results was achieved. This held true for deletions, insertions, inversions and translocations, including 3 way Philadelphia chromosome (46,XX, t(9;22;14)(q34;q11;q11.2)) and even chromothripsis. Importantly, we were able to identify aberrations in samples with a cancer cell content of just ~40%, using the latest single molecule SV detectiontool from BioNano. Optical mapping also identi ï¬ed novel events e.g. an inversion of chromosome 11 (chr11:24,875,044 26,299,641) and a translocation (t(5;14)(q35.2;q 32.2)), both validated afterwards. Optical mapping may have the potential to replace most classical cytogenetic tests. Therefore, we are now launchinga study to systematically compare the sensitivity and spe ciï¬city of optical mapping in 100 leukemia samples and 50 samples with known germline cytogenetic aberrationsagainst the standard of care work ï¬ow.

The aim of this study is to determine the ef ï¬ciency of whole exome sequencing (WES) as a ï¬rst tier diagnostic test in comparison with array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for DD. We have enrolled 322 subjects diagnosed with global developmental delay or intellectual disability of unknowncause. All individuals have completed aCGH tests (Positive rate: 17.1%). WES was performed on 24 trios and 10 pro bands with Agilent SureSelect target enrichment systemusing Illumina HiSeq2000. Twelve trios have been analyzed by Golden Helix Varseq. On average, 339 CNVs with conï¬rmed states, absent quality control ï¬ags, and p values<0.01 were called. Spans of these CNVs ranged from 118bp to 2Mbp, with approximately 329 CNVs <100kb, 9 CNVs 100kb 1Mb, and 1 CNV >1Mb in each case. Duplications accounted for 57.6% con ï¬dent CNV calls. Moreover, WES allows us to investigate single nucleotide variations (SNVs). Among the 12 trios, we have discoveredcausal SNVs for two cases corresponding with their clinical phenotypes. Further validation by qPCR is required to conï¬rm the precision of CNV detection results by WES. We will also evaluate how consistent WES detection results are with aCGH. Here we demonstrate the capacity of WES for detecting CNVs and SNVs.

In this study we sought to compare the ef ï¬ciencies of exome sequencing (ES) by trio (tES) versus singleton (sES) approach, determine costs,and identify factors to cons ider when deciding on optimal implementation strategies for the diagnosis of monogenic disorders. We undertook ES in 30 trios and analysed eachproband âs sES and tES data in parallel. Two teams were randomly allocated to either sES or tES analysis for each case and blinded to each other âsw o r k .E a c ht a s kw a s timed and cost analyses were based on time taken and diagnostic yield. We modelled three scenarios to deter mine the factors to consider in the implementation of tES.sES diagnosed 11/30 (36.7%) cases and tES identi ï¬ed one additional diagnosis (12/30 (40.0%)). tES obviated the need for Sanger segregation, reduced the number ofvariants for curation, and had lower cost per diagnosis when considering analysis alone. When sequencing costs were included, tES nearly doubled the cost of sES. Reï¬exing to tES in those who remain undiagnosed after sES was cost saving over tES in all as ï¬rst line. This approach requires a large differential in diagnostic yieldbetween sES and tES for maximal bene ï¬t given current sequencing costs. tES may be preferable when scaling up laboratory throughput due to ef ï¬ciency gains and opportunity cost considerations.

30912,"Asuragen, Austin, TX, United StatesIntroduction: Myotonic dystrophies are autosomal domi nant, multisystemic disorders with variable expressivity characterized by progressive myopathy. Myotonic dystro phy type 1 (DM1) is caused by CTG expansions in the 3 â UTR of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. The severity of disease and age at onset is roughly correlated with the number of the trinucleotide repeats. Reliable assessment of CTG expansions is critical for diagnosis ofDM1. We developed and validated the AmplideX Â®DM1 Dx Kit, which generates numerical values for alleles â¤200 repeats and a categorical value for alleles >200 repeats. Materials and Methods: The kit enables repeat primed PCR of genomic DNA isolated from whole blood, followed by capillary electrophoresis (CE), manual peak annotation,and automated repeat length calculations. For exploratory size estimation beyond 200 repeats, the kit facilitates an optional agarose analysis. Results: Analytical validation spanned 2192 valid mea surements, 1588 genotypes, and 730 unique CE ï¬les. Single site precision demonstrated that alleles with 5 to 145repeats were sized within 1 repeat of the mode (n>200). The limit of detection was <4% fractional mosaic by probit analysis. All homozygous and heterozygous samples werecorrectly identi ï¬ed. Expanded alleles were accurately sized when â¤200 repeats and larger expansions up to at least 1900 repeats were ampli ï¬ed and categorically detected. A method comparison yielded highly correlated results (100% con cordance and y ,0.91+1.01x, R2 ,1.00). Conclusions: This single tube assay combines gene speciï¬c and repeat primed designs to assess DM1 genotype and resolve zygosity.

Therefore, DNA fragments are ligated to adapters contain ing a double stranded degenerate sequence. Currently, fork adapters consisting of two partially complementary oligo nucleotides are being used in DS. However, it has beensuggested that adapters comprising a hairpin loop structure, such as the NEBNext adapters, show improved performance in library preparation and sequencing. Here, we proposedifferent synthesis methods for creating hairpin loop adapters for DS in house. Material and Methods: We have developed a synthesis strategy for a hairpin adapter and for adapters containing a phosphorothioate bond at the ligation site. Currently we use an adapted protocol for DS library preparation with thoseloop adapters. Adapter synthesis and proper function has been veri ï¬ed by gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Results: We have successfully synthesized the proposed hairpin adapters and replaced the fork adapter used in the original protocol by Schmitt et al. (2012) with our loop adapters. Sequencing data con ï¬rm their experimental feasibility. Discussion: Our hairpin adapters might offer advantages over previously used fork adapters due to structural differ ences. Additionally, we integrated a phosphorothioate bond into DS hairpin adapters which might increase the stability of the ligation site, reduce removal of the 3 âT overhang and thus, decrease potential adapter dimer formation between blunt ended sites.

Indeed, trio based strategy facilitates variants interpretation thanks to parental segregation but increases sequencing cost. We so explored an alternative cost efï¬cient trio like approach, based on parental DNA pooling. Materials and Methods: We pooled 6 paternal and 6 maternal DNA into two separate mixes. ES was performedwith an average depth of 70X (TWIG) or 100X (Agilent CREV2) and an expected allelic balance in the pool of 5.8% and 8.3%, respectively. Results: After a conclusive proof of concept in 6 positive individuals, this pool strategy was initially applied in 29 individuals with DI and/or AD, as second tier after normalsingleton cES. We so identi ï¬ed candidate variants in 19 different genes. After datasharing, we con ï¬rmed causal implication of 7 genes in 8/29 individuals (27%) including 3genes newly involved in human disorders. This high rate led us to deploy this strategy as a ï¬rst tier exam in 82 indivi duals without previous cES. Conclusion: In ID/DA, parental pool strategy appears very cost ef ï¬cient by combining increased diagnostic yields compared to singleton ES and decreased sequencing costs,compared to classical trio approach. This could represent an interesting alternative to trio based ES in molecular laboratories performing exome routinely. F. Tran Mau Them: None. A. Vitobello: None. Y. Duffourd: None. A. Bruel: None.

We performed reanalysis of ES dataand trio genome sequencing (GS) data in unsolved Estonian families with suspected Mendelian disorders to increase the diagnostic yield. ES reanalysis was performed in 85families (66 trios, 19 singletons) at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Additionally, ten families with proband only1636ES were expanded to trio ES, and 39 ES negative families were re sequenced with trio GS at Broad Institute for improved variant detection. We identi ï¬ed a pathogenic variant in a known disease gene in 14 (16%) cases; these were mainly missed due to: limited ability to detect de novo variants in proband only ES; bioinformatics issues in earlyES studies; or analysis being executed before the relevant disease gene discovery. In 15 (18%) families, we identi ï¬ed a pathogenic variant in a novel disease gene, of which someare already published via collaborations initiated through the Matchmaker exchange ( RORA ,RAB11A , and CYFIP2 ). In 27 (32%) families a candidate gene was found andfunctional studies are in progress for eight of these. The remaining 29 (34%) patients are still unsolved. Using this approach, we improved our diagnostic yield for previouslyundiagnosed cases by solving an additional 1/3 of the cases (total 53%) and by having a promising gene candidate for another 1/3 of the remaining families.

One of the objectives of the Belgian Plan for Rare Diseases is to develop funding for their participation to EQAs for genetic tests focused on hereditary rare diseases. A screening of quality controls focused on rare diseases available in Belgium and abroad was ï¬rstly performed. Based on this preliminary step, a survey was sent to the BCHGs to collect information about their participation to these inventoried quality controls, their provider and theirevaluation of the schemes. Then, a working group (WG) composed of members from the BCHGs and the Belgian institute for health has been set up. This working group is selecting priority EQAs for which participation fees should be covered by the Belgian healthcare authorities according to clinical relevanceand costs. Since there is no rules, the WG is also focusing on the harmonization of the participation frequencies to EQAs bywriting guidelines on the minimal frequency of participation to EQAs focused on hereditary rare diseases âdiagnosis. These guidelines will provide recommendations on how often it is necessary for the BCHGs to perform EQAs and they will serve as basis for the reimbursement of the selected EQAs. The proposed EQAs and the budget tocover participation fees will be submitted to the Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (RIZIV INAMI) for evaluation and approval.

Several methods have been proposed up to date, utilizing different attributes of analysed genomic material, for example length and genomic location ofsequenced DNA fragments. These sources of information are relatively different, but so far, at least according to our knowledge, there were no published attempts to combinethem to get an improved predictor. Materials and Methods: We propose several fetal frac tion estimation improvements with special focus on the samples that are most prone to wrong diagnostic conclu sions. We introduced new method for estimating fetal fraction (Non linear regression model) and also compared other statistical (Linear regression model) and machinelearning methods (Neural networks, Support vector machines). Results: We demonstrate, that although understudied, prediction based on length of sequenced DNA fragments may achieve nearly the precision as state of the art methods based on their genomic locations. Finally, we show thatcombination of several sample attributes leads to a predictor that has superior prediction accuracy over any single approach.

However, the analysis of multiple genes at once is not always paired with enough knowledge regarding molecular pathology, geneticutility, associated risks and clinical management. Our aim is to discuss some of the current challenges in hereditary cancer testing. Concerning special gene features: Not always truncating variants in tumour suppressor genes are pathogenic, due to functional rescue by othertranscripts (i.e. BRCA1 ,TSC2 ). Several genes have nearly identical sequences and exist in multiple locations as a result of segmental duplications. This fact can cause an important decrease in the accuracy of variant detection, even reporting pseudogene variants as pathogenic. We face this problem in PMS2 ,PRSS1 , BMPR1A ,CHEK2 ,BRCA1 ,NF1 andPTEN . Concerning variant classi ï¬cation: Some hereditary cancer conditions are caused by acti vating variants, so the widely used ACMG/AMP classi ï¬ cation guidelines should be applied with caution. In the same gene, different pathogenic variants can confer different cancer risk. Exon/gene duplications are not necessarily pathogenic. It is mandatory to prove in each case that the variant damagesthe transcript. ClinVar clinical assertions should not be directly trans ferred to a diagnostic report since some are based oninsufï¬cient evidence. In the âone gene at a time âera,ï¬nding a pathogenic variant often led to stop the analysis. However, compre hensive (sub)exomic analysis reveals numerous cases of digenic, trigenic, and more complex inheritance patterns as seen in the increasing number of patients with MultilocusInherited Neoplasia Alleles Syndrome (MINAS).

This can be dif ï¬cult to achieve given the high prevalence of technically challenging pathogenic varianttypes in patients 1. Unfortunately, the highest sensitivity NGS methods can also produce false positives, necessitat ing the use of orthogonal con ï¬rmatory assays, a signi ï¬cant cost and time burden. Optimizing both sensitivity and speciï¬city at minimal total cost may be aided by careful analysis of large clinical data sets. Methods: Thirteen validated genetic tests in two clinical laboratories were applied to a suite of reference samples and over 50,000 patients with orthogonal data. A novel opti mization algorithm divided these variants into classes based on NGS quality metrics, type and genomic context. Each class was characterized using rigorous statistics. Results: Most pathogenic variants (90%) could be placed into classes having perfect observed accuracy (both sensi tivity and analytic PPV) with CIs 99.5% or better. Strongclaims regarding sensitivity for such variants would be justiï¬ed, and these variants do not bene ï¬t from con ï¬rma tion. The remaining variants require additional steps todetect (e.g. additional algorithms and low stringency ï¬l tering, to reduce false negatives) and often do require conï¬rmation (to reduce false positives). Conclusion: Our methods are applicable to panels, exomes, and genomes. They described in detail and can be applied by many laboratories 1,2. These methods and data may inform emerging international guidelines on clinical NGS3.

The validity and reproducibility of research relieson access to ethically sourced, authenticated, quality controlled samples. The UK MND Collections (formerly the UK MND DNA Bank) is a biological resource,containing DNA, cell lines and epidemiological data for MND research. Objectives: To collect and make available samples, and associated clinical data, from cohorts of patients, their parents/siblings and controls, representing cases of sporadic and familial MND for research into genetic risk factors. Methods: Over 3000 patient and control blood samples were collected and sent to the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures for storage and Epstein Barrvirus (EBV) transformation into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). EBV transformation had been demonstrated to be an efï¬cient, cost effective method for immortalising patient samples, allowing for a potentially unlimited supply of DNA. The LCL underwent authentication testing to ensure that they matched the original patient blood sample and therespective DNA. Results: LCL were generated from all blood samples and in 2017, the MND Association selected 193 samples to bemade available to researchers. Gene mutations present in this sub set of cell lines include C9orf72, SOD1, FUS and TARDBP. Discussion: To support MND research the patient and control cell lines are available from ECACC followingapproval from the MND Association.

The untargeted solutions based on next generation sequencing have proved to be cost effective inthe diagnosis of a wide range of conditions and have also led to a signi ï¬cative reduction in time to diagnosis. We developed GenoinVar, an integrative end to end solution from the biological sample to exome sequencing and variant analysis to the discovery of causal genetic variants. The solution involves Illumina whole exomesequencing using a capture procedure from IDT, with uni form and above speci ï¬cations sequencing metrics. Sequencing data is processed using an in house pipeline,and an encrypted database of variants with the corre sponding annotations is created. Candidate variants are prioritized in our ExomeLoupe platform, an intuitive anduser friendly Windows software for variant selection and interpretation. ExomeLoupe interacts directly with the encrypted database enabling users to securely store, analyzeand share this sensitive genetic information in compliance with the GDPR. This end to end solution was developed in the framework of In2Genome, a multidisciplinary project to integrate exome sequencing in clinical practice, with experts of Genoinseq, Coimbra Genomics and the Genetics Unit of theCoimbra Pediatric Hospital (CHUC). GenoinVar validation included 13 molecular diagnosed patients selected by clin ical geneticists. The GenoinVar sequencing results wereanalyzed by two independent blinded specialists using ExomeLoupe that successfully identi ï¬ed the previously reported causal variants in all 13 cases.

We aimed to assess this technology in comparisonto the current standard of care. GS data with an average read depth of 5X was processed with a number of CNV callers to evaluate performance. These included: WisecondorX, Canvas, Lumpy, Manta, Breakseq2, Breakdancer, Delly, and CNVnator. We also investigated a CNV caller developed by the Leeds MRCMedical Bioinformatics Centre. Data was downsampled in order to test these algorithms at a series of read depths. After optimising the algorithms by modifying the seedlength or window size, we demonstrated detection of CNVs down to 0.3Mb at a read depth of 0.05X. To determine whether this method is a feasible and cost effective, sampleswith known CNV calls were prepared using the NEXT FELX Rapid DNA Seq kit, sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform and analysed using the re ï¬ned pipeline. To match the current cost of CMA analysis, each sample can be sequenced to roughly 0.225X. Furthermore, tissue samples were run to investigate the resilience of low readdepth GS for poor quality samples. In conclusion, low read depth GS performed similarly to CMA for CNVs >0.3Mb, even at read depths as low as 0.05X. Although issues sur rounding mapping repetitive regions and breakpoint accu racy need to be resolved, we have demonstrated that low read depth GS can offer an improved, low cost service incomparison to CMA.

Method: Data were extracted from laboratory records. Testing was initially performed on the Illumina Inherited Diseaseâ¢, Trusight Cancer â¢ and Trusight One â¢ sequencing panels, dependent on genes requested. Wecurrently use virtual panels on either a custom designed Roche 1228 gene panel or the Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ MedExome. Libraries were sequenced on the IlluminaMiSeq or NextSeq sequencing systems. Results were clas siï¬ed according to the ACMG standards. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic results were con ï¬rmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: 3068 tests were performed. The highest diag nosis rate (98%) was for con ï¬rmation of a biochemical diagnosis. High diagnosis rates were achieved for Duchennemuscular dystrophy (71%, 15% VUS), Alport syndrome (55%, VUS 7%), neuromuscular (48%, VUS 38%) and connective tissue (42%, VUS 32%) panel testing. Thelowest diagnostic rates were seen in Ehlers Danlos (9%, VUS 55%), Noonan (27%, VUS 20%), Cornelia de Lange (29%, VUS 43%), single gene/small panel (28%, VUS21%) and large gene panel testing (22%, VUS 24%).

Typically, GWASs are carried out usingchip based genotyping data, which are then combined with a more densely genotyped reference panel to infer untyped genetic variants in chip typed individuals. Publicly avail able and ethnically heterogeneous imputation reference panels (IRPs) such as 1000G are suf ï¬ciently accurate for imputation of common and low frequency variants. Population speci ï¬c IRPs have demonstrated great improve ment in imputation accuracy of rare variants, but their effect to the downstream analysis is not very well examined. We systematically compared downstream association analysis effects in ~37,000 Estonians imputed with ethni cally mixed 1000G and ethnically matched Estonian Finnish IRPs. Firstly, variant wise GWASs were per formed on eight complex traits (body mass index and seven complex diseases of major public health importance).Although several previously reported common variant associations were replicated in both imputed datasets, no major differences were observed. Secondly, a gene basedtests of rare (MAF < 1%) nonsynonymous and loss of function variants were conducted and identi ï¬ed signi ï¬cant gene trait associations were studied in the UK Biobankdata. Gene based analysis demonstrated that ethnically matched panel outperformed the 1000G based imputation, provided 10 fold increase in tested genes and signi ï¬cant ï¬ndings. Validation indicated that most of the signi ï¬cantly associated genes were previously known, but there were some which turned out to be worthwhile novel ï¬ndings. In conclusion, we observed that population speci ï¬c panel ensures a better imputation quality for rare variation and captures more population speci ï¬c variants, enabling more efï¬cient discovery of disease associated genes.

To determine the location and orientation of the duplicatedarea, targeted enrichment of the genomic BRCA2 locus followed by NGS was performed. Its spatial properties were identi ï¬ed by the bioinformatic tool CNV Hunter and vali dated by breakpoint spanning PCR and Sanger Sequencing. Additionally, the probands âfour sisters were tested for the duplication via Sanger Sequencing. Results: Using NGS, we showed the tandem organization of the BRCA2 exon 22 to 24 duplication, Chr13(GRCh37): g.32951528_32960522dup, in the proband, but not in hersisters. Theoretically, the duplication causes a frameshift and leads to a premature stop codon (p. Ala3088PhefsTer3). This may lead to nonsense mediated mRNA decay and islikely to be pathogenic. Conclusions: We demonstrate rapid and accurate identi ï¬cation of a genomic rearrangement using next generation sequencing. This case study demonstrates the ability of high throughput sequencing to detect and characterize, besides single nucleotide variants, large genomicrearrangements. J. Bublitz: None.

Tradi tional quality control methods do not provide the required sizing accuracy of DNA greater than 50kb or the sensitivity allowing for sample conservation during the quality controlassessment steps. The Femto Pulse system by Agilent Technologies works to streamline quality control byseparating genomic DNA up to 165kb in as little as 70 minutes, down from the 16 +hours required for traditional agarose PFGE. The unparalleled single cell gDNA sensitivity of the Femto Pulse allows for preparation of low input NGS libraries from cfDNA, RNA, and miniaturized traditional DNA NGS libraries. Quality controlmetrics such as the RNA Quality Number (RQN) and user deï¬ned Genomic Quality Number (GQN) aids in the determination of sample quality/integrity.

SantillÃ¡n1 1Sistemas GenÃ³micos (ASCIRES), Valencia, Spain, 2Hospital Vall d`Hebron, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Clinical utility of exome sequencing has been well established during the last few years. In this context, HPO terms provides an important source of information that allows to correlate phenotypes, diseasesand genes. Methodology: Exome data from 188 patients were evaluated retrospectively. Primitively, these patients wereanalyzed using 7165 disease associated genes, that was considered as the gold standard. Performance of three dif ferent gene prioritization strategies was compared: candi date genes, genes associated to HPO terms provided by the physician and genes associated to prioritized HPO terms. Results: Clinical exome allowed the diagnosis of 35% (66/188) of the patients. The candidate gene strategy was positive in 15% of the patients (29/188), while the strategy based on the selection of genes through the combination ofHPOs reached a 29% diagnosis (54/188). Using HPOs terms, an average of 796 genes was evaluated. The selection of genes based on the combination of prioritized HPOterms, obtained a diagnostic rate of 25% (45/188). A detailed analysis of positive cases not identi ï¬ed under any of these prioritization strategies (12/66), showed that the useof less speci ï¬c HPO terms would help detect the affected gene in 8/12 cases. Conclusion: The use of HPO terms is a strategy that allows the diagnosis in a high percentage of cases, but its efï¬cacy depends signi ï¬cantly on the selection andprioritization of this terms. The use of a genotype phenotype strategy allows greater diagnostic rate since there may be cardinal symptoms not identi ï¬ed during the clinical evaluation of the patients. C. GÃ³mez SÃ¡nchez: None.

30937,"CharitÃ© UniverstÃ¤tsmedizin, Berlin, GermanyIn clinical genetics, the Human Phenotype Ontology as well as disease ontologies are often used for deep phenotyping ofpatients and coding of clinical diagnoses. However, assigning ontology classes to patient descriptions is often disconnected from writing patient reports or manuscripts inword processing software. This additional workload and the requirement to install dedicated software may discourage usage of ontologies for parts of the target audience. Here we present Phenotero, a freely available and simple solution to annotate patient phenotypes and diseases at the time of writing clinical reports or manuscripts. We adoptZotero, a citation management software to create a tool which allows to reference classes from ontologies within text at the time of writing. We expect this approach todecrease the additional workload to a minimum while ensuring high quality associations with ontology classes. Standardised collection of phenotypic information at thetime of describing the patient allows for streamlining the clinic work ï¬ow and ef ï¬cient data entry. It will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis with the ultimategoal of better understanding genetic diseases. Thus, we hope that Phenotero eases the usage of ontologies and controlled vocabularies in the ï¬ eld of clinical genetics. S. KÃ¶hler: None. D. Hombach: None. J. Schwarz: None. E. Knierim: None. M.

We aimed to develop and validate 5 NGS assays for several IEM groups: organic aciduria (AO), fatty acid oxidation defects (FAO), aminoacidopathy (AA),vitamin B defects (AAVB) and carbohydrate disorders (GH). Material and methods: 5 IEM panels (4 37 genes, 15 158kbp) were designed for multiplex PCR targetedenrichment and evaluated in silico before production. In vitro assessment was performed on NIST RM 8398, 1000G reference materials and dried blood spot samples. Librarieswere prepared with Parseq protocol based on targeted enrichment followed by adapter ligation, barcoding and sequencing on MiSeq and IonTorrent platforms. Alignmentand variant calling were performed using VariFind â¢ Software. Analytical characteristics were calculated within all targeted regions (all variants and wild type positions).Clinically relevant variants from ClinVar database were evaluated. Results: Analytical performance of 5 IEM panels were established: sensitivity 95.5 100%, speci ï¬city 97.0 99.4%. Assays limitations and clinically relevant variants within regions with low quality were described. Conclusions: 5 assays for con ï¬rmative IEM diagnostics are validated on Parseq protocol and pipeline, using MiSeq and IonTorrent (data not shown) platforms. IEM panelscould be mixed in a single run. Assays are suitable for dried blood spot samples. Analytical performance of assays is sufï¬cient for the further clinical trials.

30939,"Pathogenic variants in the red and green cone opsins, encoded by OPN1LW andOPN1MW respectively, lead to visual impairment. The genes are located in tandem on Xq28 and show 98% homology. Current routine diagnosticsuses gene speci ï¬c long range (LR )PCRs, followed by shearing and short read sequencing, combined with MLPA, which are hampered by the high homology, variable copynumbers and occurrence of hybrid OPN1 genes. We therefore investigated the power of long read sequencing compared to standard short read sequencing. Hereto,OPN1LW and OPN1MW of 47 known clinical samples were ampli ï¬ed using gene speci ï¬c LR PCRs of ~16kb, and sequenced as 2x 8kb fragments. In addition, a subset was also sequenced as 16kb fragments. Library preparation, sequencing, and circular consensus sequence (CCS) analy sis were performed according to PacBio protocols using theSequel system. All pathogenic variants and hybrid genes were con ï¬rmed using the 8kb read length, with the advantage of decreasedhands on time for data analysis and interpretation. Mapping of the 8kb fragments was however still hampered by high sequence homology. The latter was overcome by 16kb frag ment long read sequencing data, which showed improved quality and mapping compared to the 8kb reads. We therefore conclude that long read sequencing can detect both pointmutations and hybrid OPN1 genes. With 8kb reads having the power to accelerate OPN1 data analysis and interpretation in comparison to standard short read sequencing, we expect thatwith further improvements using 16kb CCS reads, it will become possible to also detect OPN1 copy number variants and point mutations using a single test.

Because of this, REDs patients yet have not bene ï¬ted from the advent of massively parallel sequencing (MPS), a method that otherwise revolutionised differential diagnos tics of the majority of monogenic and complex disorders. Materials and Methods: We developed an alignment free bioinformatics tool to characterize clinically relevantattributes of STR loci from MPS data sets. It was tested on a commercial targeted MPS panel, using different disease associated STR loci. Validation was extended to sampleshaving expansions in the myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) associated DMPK gene. Results were validated by gold standard methods such as conventional and repeat primedPCR. We then characterized aspects of MPS based REDs testing in routine practice. Results: We were able to reliably genotype ampli ï¬able STR alleles, determine their sequence structure, to phase individual alleles, and also to identify the presence of expanded alleles exceeding the ampli ï¬cation limit of the used MPS assay, overcoming thus the conventional ampli ï¬cation derived limitations of MPS. When compared to using MPS for more common variation types, such as singlenucleotide variants, we found several practical problems, especially connected to automated annotation of identi ï¬ed repeat alleles. Conclusions: Beyond technological questions, to fully beneï¬t from MPS based differential diagnostics there are several aspects of testing which requires modi ï¬cations when compared to current practice, from nomenclature of alleles, through database feeding, up to automated annota tion of alleles.

Methods: We performed medical exome analyses focusing on a clinically interpretable portion of the genome (4813 genes) as a ï¬rst tier genetic test for 360 consecutive patients visiting a genetics clinic at a tertiary children âs hospital in Japan, over a 3 year period. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted using standard software including BWA, GATK, and SnpEff. Results: A molecular diagnosis was made in 171 patients involving a total of 107 causative genes. Among these 107 causative genes, 57 genes were classi ï¬ed as genes with potential organ speci ï¬c interventions and management strategies. Hence, clinically relevant results were obtained in approximately a quarter of the patients. A cost effectiveness analysis indicated that the overall cost would have been less expensive by 330 euros if a medical exome analysis had been performed at the time of the initial visit toa tertiary center, rather than after multiple visits to various specialists, a brain MRI examination, and G banded chro mosome analysis. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated a high diagnostic yield (47.5%) for singleton medical exome ana lysis as a ï¬rst tier test in a real life setting. From a public health policy standpoint, genomic testing can be more efï¬cient for diagnosis with a cost that is comparable or less to that of currently used tests with lower diagnostic poten tial, including brain MRI and chromosome testing.

All coding exons were sequenced by smMIPs in two well characterizedDutch cohorts of in total 703 obese patients with different metabolic complications (a.o. cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and liver steatosis) and in a control cohort of 520healthy individuals. Results: Rare variants were de ï¬ned as those with a minor allele frequency less than 1% in the exome sequencingGenome Aggregation Database. In the obese cohorts Â±62 68% of the total identi ï¬ed variants were rare, compared to Â±73% in the healthy individuals.

Targeted bisul ï¬te sequencing has become the primary choice for single base methylation quanti ï¬cation ofmultiple targets in parallel. Ef ï¬cient bisul ï¬te conversion is a critical aspect of this technique and incomplete conversion or the preferential ampli ï¬cation of an allele and strand can lead to inaccurate results. To avoid the cost and time of redesigning new assays, calibration methods based on standard controls have been suggested to correct PCR bias. Methods: We have developed a novel Bayesian calibra tion tool, MethylCal, which analyses jointly all CpGs within a CpG island or a differentially methylated region (DMR)avoiding âone at a time âCpG calibration. Results: Compared to existing methods, MethylCal is more ï¬exible and ï¬tted the data better and provided a more accurate prediction of the methylation levels. We success fully tested MethylCal on six imprinting DMRs and two CpG islands and bene ï¬ts of the new method, including the ability to detect outliers and impute missing values. Conclusion: MethylCal with the speci ï¬cation of different random effects adequately accounts for the patterns ofvariances and correlations of the methylation levels across actual methylation percentages better than existing calibration tools.

In our study, we evaluated the liquid biopsy as an important source of cancerderived DNA for MSI detection. Materials and Methods: Formalin ï¬xed paraf ï¬n embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and liquid biopsy sampleswere collected from 23 colorectal cancer patients. Genomic DNA and circulating cell free DNA (ccfDNA) were isolated from blood samples, then concentrations and qualities werecompared. Testing for MSI was performed using kits obtained from Promega Corporation. Microsatellite alterations were scoredby comparing the electrophoretic pro ï¬les of each biomarker (targeted gene regions of BAT 25, BAT 26, NR 21, NR 24, MONO 27, Penta C and Penta D) in genomic DNA versusccfDNA. Results: Of the 23 patients, the electrophoretic pro ï¬les of microsatellite biomarkers tested in ccfDNA matched thosein the respective primary tumors in all cases with the higher quality in liquid biopsy samples relatively. Conclusions: There was an excellent concordance between liquid biopsy samples and FFPE tumor samples to detect MSI.

However, the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and detection of mutations is problematic due to a low portion of mtDNA in total cellular DNA andphenomenon of heteroplasmy that occurs in mitochondria. Considering human mtDNA does not contain introns, the reconstruction of whole mitochondrial genome throughRNA sequencing seems to be effective. Materials and Methods: VERO E6 lineage of cells was used as a material for molecular analysis. RNA isolationwas accomplished from the cell suspension and subsequent reverse transcription were followed by preparation of DNAlibrary. DNA analysis processing was automated using pipelines implemented in the SnakeLines framework run ning on the Snakemake work ï¬ow engine. Results: The data from sequencer were processed by de novo assembly method to generate contigs from short fragments without the aid of reference genome. We wereable to reconstruct total mtDNA by RNA sequencing where the most problematic were RNA non coding regions, par ticularly the D loop region. However, using our method, wewere able to sequence also non coding regions. Conclusion: mtDNA represents a small but signi ï¬cant segment of the total DNA of the individual. The very smallamount compared to genomic DNA is the enormous pro blem in its successful study. Therefore, our method is not based on direct DNA sequencing for mitochondrial genomereconstruction, but on RNA sequencing of cell lysate. L. Strie Å¡kovÃ¡: None. I. GazdaricovÃ¡: None. M.

Three classic subtypes arepolycythemia vera (PV). Essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelo ï¬brosis (PMF). These disorders are well known for their association with the JAK2 V617F mutation,in addition to mutations on MPL exon10, and JAK2 exon 12. CALR mutations were detected in approximately 20% to 25% of patients with ET and PMF and not in patientswith PV. Most CALR mutations were deletions and insertions in exon 9, which cause frameshift mutations. Methods: This study included 60 patients with MPN in Taiwanese population. We identi ï¬ed CALR mutation in patients with MPN by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Additionally, HRM analysis was compared withipsogen CALR RGQ PCR. To con ï¬rm the results of HRM and ipsogen CALR RGQ PCR, sequencing analysis was also carried out for all samples. Results: Up to 6.25% of the CALR mutation was suc cessfully detected in patients with MPN using HRM1650analysis. Four out of 60 patients (6.67%) were positive for the presence of CALR mutation including p. L367fs*46 and p. K385fs*47. The results proved 100% comparable to those obtained by ipsogen CALR RGQ PCR. Conclusions: The HRM analysis and ipsogen CALR RGQ PCR are feasible and reliable technique for thedetection of CALR mutation.

Sti., Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Inherited metabolic diseases (IEM) are usually devastating, and caused by single gene defects. In newborns, for the differential diagnosis of IEM, a numberof laboratory tests must be performed. During these intensive investigations, a vast majority of severely ill patients die without a de ï¬nite diagnosis. Recently, a number of newborn screening tests based on next generation sequencing (NGS) have been develop to replace expensive and time consuming conventional laboratory tests. In thisstudy, we describe a rapid and effective screening test for 3 severe metabolic diseases (maple syrup urine disease, biotinidase de ï¬ciency and mucopolysaccharidosis type 1) based on Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT). Materials and Methods: PCR based target enrichment was performed on all exons of the 5 genes ( DBT, BCKDHB, BCKDHA, IDUA, BTD ) responsible for the 3 diseases. Multiplex PCR studies were performed using super fastAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1651thermal cyclers and fast polymerases. The ampli ï¬ed regions were then sequenced with the ONT MinION device. Results were veri ï¬ed with the Illumina Miseq platform. Based on the data obtained, the appropriate bioinformatic tools were selected and their parameters were optimized. Results: Using ONT, satisfactory molecular genetic screening results were obtained for in a far shorter time period (below 4 hours), than is currently available utilizing NGS. Despite the protocol being highly successful forsingle nucleotide variations, for insertions and deletions artifacts were present. Conclusions: This is the ï¬rst study developed using ONT for the screening of metabolic disease. The development of speciï¬c bioinformatic tools is necessary to further improve the speed and accuracy of the results. H. Onay: None. B. Akgun: None. T. Yalcinkaya: None. E. Dilsizoglu: None. A. B.

To adequately quantify the impact of their introduction in patient care, it is essential to have detailed insight in current costs of diagnosticprocedures. We provide an overview of average healthcare costs for patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to facilitate discussion on the possible impactof rapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES) on total healthcare costs. Methods: We retrospectively collected postnatal health care data of 1,423 children admitted to the NICU at the Radboudumc between October 2013 and October 2015. We distinguished between children with a conclusive molecular diagnosis found within the ï¬rst 30 days of life (for com parison to rWES) and those genetically diagnosed after thisperiod. Results: Overall, the average costs spent were â¬24,357 per patient. Of the 1,423 patients, 149 (10.5%) underwentgenetic diagnostic testing. In 13 (8.7%) a genetic diagnosis was obtained during the ï¬rst 30 days of life and for 35 (22.8%) thereafter. For patients with a genetic diagnosis<31 days of life, total costs spent on genetic diagnostics accounted for 3.4% of all costs ( â¬1.842 per patient), whereas for those receiving a genetic diagnosis >30 days,costs for genetic testing were 5.0% ( â¬3.495 per patient) of total costs. Conclusions: Genetic diagnostic testing in a NICU patient cohort accounts for a small fraction of total costs. With an anticipated increase in genetic diagnoses, a shorter time to diagnosis, and reduction of sequencing costs,implementation of rWES for this patient cohort may be warranted. R. A.C. M.

30952,"Ierland, ENCORE Expertise Center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands Background: Neuro ï¬bromatosis type 1 (NF1) mutation detection and variant interpretation is challenging. We compared clinical characteristics of patients with NF1 variants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VUS) or no mutation identi ï¬ed (NF1 NMI) to those with pathogenic NF1 variants. Secondly, we performed in vitro functional assessment to reclassify NF1 VUS. Methods: Clinical characterization Clinical and genetic information of clinically suspected NF1 patients wasextracted from the departmental NF1 database (1993 2016). Characteristics of the NF1 VUS and NF1 NMI groups were compared to the NF1 pathogenic variant group. Functional characterization of NF1 VUS Expression constructs encoding NF1 VUS were derived by site directed1652mutagenesis. By in vitro assays, we estimated the RAS GAP activity of the neuro ï¬bromin variant proteins using a RAS GTP pull down assay. Secondly, we used coimmu noprecipitation to investigate whether the interaction between neuro ï¬bromin and SPRED1 was affected. Results: We identi ï¬ed 417 (68%) pathogenic NF1 var iants, 33 (5%) VUS and 167 (27%) NF1 NMI individuals. The percentage of patients in each group who met the clinical NF1 NIH criteria was 64%, 67% and 34% respec tively. In the NF1 NMI group 45% of the individuals only had one NF1 NIH criterion identi ï¬ed. Functional assess ment on 27 NF1 VUS resulted in reclassi ï¬cation of 6 VUS as pathogenic and 10 as likely pathogenic. Conclusions: Clinically, the NF1 VUS group was largely comparable to the pathogenic variant group. Functionalanalyses were useful to further classify NF1 VUS. Due to the clinical and familial consequences of an NF1 diagnosis, future studies should focus on optimizing assays of neuro ï¬bromin function to facilitate establishing an accurate molecular diagnosis.

A patient âs genetic information is useful for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of disease as well as factors impactingexpanded familial screening. To demonstrate the applic ability of NEBNext Direct target enrichment for genetic screening of germline variants, we have developed target enrichment panels speci ï¬c to inherited disease. Spanning from a single gene panel for cystic ï¬brosis screening to a comprehensive panel for screening an array of cardiac related diseases, the NEBNext Direct technology can be applied to a wide range of genomic targets, using a novel hybridization based, single day work ï¬ow. The approach rapidly hybridizes both strands of genomic DNA to biotinylated baits, captures the targets on streptavidin beads,enzymatically removes off target sequence, and directly converts captured molecules into Illumina ready libraries. The sequencing reads have highly de ï¬ned start sites and produce uniform coverage across a given target. The NEBNext Direct CFTR Panel consists of a single pool of baits targeting both strands of DNA across 27 exons and 7intronic sites, for a total captured territory of 6.751 kilobases. The panel enables screening and detection of over the 2,000 variants that have been recorded worldwide. The NEBNext Direct Cardiogenomics Panel covers 160 genes associated with a range of cardiomyopathies as well as Brugada, Noonan, Marfan, and Long QT syndromes.

Several targeted Next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are currently available. Aim of this study was to develop areliable technique to rapidly and accurately re sequence multiple genes in a large cohort of PN patients at a low cost. Materials and Methods: We compared the sensitivity, speciï¬city, ef ï¬ciency, reproducibility and cost effectiveness of TruSeq Â®Custom Amplicon (TSCA, Illumina) and Molecular Inversion Probes (MIPs) NGS methods. To tar get nine sodium channel genes, capture probes were designed using their respective informatics pipelines. One hundred sixty six patients with PN were tested by bothmethods, 70 samples were also validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: Approximately 39kb were sequenced. 95% of the targeted regions showed an average coverage of â¥20x in TSCA, and 96% in MIPs. Sanger sequencing showed a 100% agreement with MIPs and TSCA. Sensitivity, speci ï¬city, performance of the two techniques were comparable, showing user friendly software to design probes and similar on target ef ï¬ciency. MIPs has a more versatile assay design, ï¬exible, allowing probes re placement and integration. TSCA results less ï¬exible, but probes dosage adjustment was unnecessary. The per sample price for MIP was about10x less than TSCA. Conclusions: MIPs approach is more suitable for wide NGS panels on high sample numbers, reducing single sample pricing if processed on a high performance plat form, whereas TSCA seems to be very time effective and could represent the best solution to analyze smaller samplesizes on a cheaper ï¬ow cell.

While the performance of the current state of the art NIPTsolutions achieve high sensitivity and speci ï¬city, they still struggle with a considerable number of samples that cannot be concluded with certainty. Such uninformative results areoften subject to repeated blood sampling and re analysis, usually after two weeks, and this period may cause a stress to the future mothers as well as increase the overall cost ofthe test. Materials and Methods: We propose a supplementary method to traditional z scores to reduce the number of suchuninformative calls. The method is based on a novel ana lysis of the length pro ï¬le of circulating cell free DNA which compares the change in such pro ï¬les when random based and length based elimination of some fragments is performed. Results: Although the proposed method is not as accurate as the standard z score, the combination of these two inde pendent methods correctly resolves a substantial portion of healthy samples with an uninformative result. Also themethod can be used to identify maternal aberrations, thus reducing the risk of false positive and false negative calls. Conclusions: Reliability of traditional NIPT tests based on low coverage sequencing can be improved by closer analysis of lengths of sequenced DNA fragments.

While improvement offetal imaging allows their detection during pregnancy, genetic investigations carried out in the prenatal setting are most often limited to search for a genomic imbalance bykaryotyping and/or chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Presently, molecular genetic analysis is rarely proposed due to the time and the cost needed to sequence agene by Sanger, and the genetic heterogeneity of many syndromes. The objective of our study is to test a combined approach detecting Copy Number Variants (CNVs) andSingle Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in one experiment. Materials and Methods: In partnership with Agilent, we adapted OneSeq Â®product for the prenatal diagnosis by selecting panels of genes involved in developmental dis orders and using a similar strategy to our âcustom chip âfor the detection of CNVs. Validation was performed on aseries of 21 fetuses or patients with known CNVs and/or SNVs and compared to the results previously determined by CMA and panels of genes. Results: All the 10 CNVs larger than 500kb were iden tiï¬ed by Oneseq Â®technique. Regarding the SNVs, they were all detected except one intragenic duplication in theLBMR1 gene. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the reliability of the OneSeq Â®technique and emphasizes the advantage of having a simultaneous detection of CNVs and SNVs in the prenatal setting.

Various factors, for example, pretreatments and storage conditions of blood, which are critical in sample collection, could affect gene expression detection. However, how thesefactors would actually in ï¬uence transcriptome remains largely unknown. Methods: We used RNA seq to explore the differences of expression pro ï¬les of samples from four pretreatments including Whole Blood (WB), Buffy Coat (BC), White Blood Cell (WBC) and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell(PBMC) and the effects of storage conditions. Results: Transcriptome of BC shows comparable globin mRNA ratio and gene detection ability with that of WB,while lower globin mRNA ratio and higher expressed gene number are observed in WBC and PBMC transcriptomes. Granulocytes related genes are well characterized in WBC. Transcriptome changes along with blood stored at both room temperature (RT) and 4Â°C, and more genes changes at RT especially genes related to granulocytes, while muchfewer genes changed at 4Â°C. Reference genes such as CHMP2A and PSMB4 are relatively stable, while the expression of IL1RN, which is similar in both men andwomen, increases more in women than men after 24 hours stored at RT. Conclusion: Our study provides a full scale ex vivo change of peripheral blood expression pro ï¬le, and suggests rigorous sample collection strategies to obtain authentic transcriptome.

Our research focuses on the role of DNMs in severe male infertility by studying unique cohorts of infertile patients and theirparents. To better understand DNMs and their role in disease, it is important to determine the parent of origin and timing of DNMs. This in turn requires phasing of DNMs,which is usually impossible from short read sequencing data as informative SNPs (iSNP) are often located 100 1000s of bases from a DNM. Therefore, we developed andvalidated a low cost long read sequencing approach. First, we identi ï¬ed all DNMs present in exomes from 108 patients with severe male infertility and their parents, using theIllumina Novaseq6000. Next, the short read sequencing data was used to collect the location and genotypes of all iSNPs surrounding the DNMs. These target regions werethen sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION. Several dif ï¬culties were addressed; DNA origin, amplicon size, coverage, and high basecalling error. Depending onamplicon read length and based on coverage obtained thus far, this approach can accurately phase ~100 de novo mutations per MinION run. This analysis indicated that68% of the DNMs identi ï¬ed in these infertile men occurred in the paternal gamete pre fertilization, not unlike what is known for DNMs in the normal population. From furtheranalysis we identi ï¬ed the timing of all DNMs, noting 26% occurred postzygotically. Had these postzygotic DNMs occurred earlier they could have negatively impactedgametogenesis and/or the reproductive success of the parents. G. S. Holt: None. M. J. Xavier: None. M. S. Oud: None. B.

Methods: By using a sensor calibrated in the Near Infrared spectrum (optical window: 700nm to 1000nm), we acquired spectra from DBS card alone, DBS card with areference concentration scale for Phe alone, and Phe plus Tyr. Based on these data we selected the most sensitive wavelength window within the NIR and exploited this parameter to acquire spectra from DBS containing Î¼blood spiked with 0 to 1200 Î¼M Phe, 0 to 1200 Tyr and with different Phe/Tyr ratios. An additional experiment using 100 calibrators with 5 data points for phenylalaninemia was performed. For eachsample, at least 20 scans in duplicate were acquired. Prin cipal component analysis (PCA) was conducted. Results: The analysis of the âscrubbed âdata both by a speciï¬c spectrometry software and by data point algorithms, clearly show that it is possible to correlate the nature of the analyte and its relative concentration. Acquired spectra present signi ï¬cative differences, and it is possible to isolate a speci ï¬c Phe NIR ï¬ngerprint.

30960,"Molecular Neurology, VIB, Antwerp, Belgium,2Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, Antwerp,Belgium Genome wide rare variant analysis has become a preferred strategy for disease gene discovery. Several algorithms are available to test association of these variants to disease in a case control study design. However, achieving the neces sary power to detect exome wide signi ï¬cance in rare variant association studies is challenging due to variant number and sample size limitations. Therefore, additional strategies areneeded to prioritize and interpret rare variants in under powered patient cohorts. Accumulating evidence indicates that the endosomal lysosomal system is a key mediator inthe neurodegenerative process. In search of novel disease genes for unresolved frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we applied a pathway based approach to prioritize endo lysosomal pathway related genes with rare variants from in house generated patient control exome datasets. Starting from a list of 49 seed genes genetically linked or associatedto FTD or related neurodegenerative diseases, we identi ï¬ed ï¬rst and second layer interaction partners of these known dementia related proteins. The raw interaction network wasthen ï¬ltered for brain expressed genes based on GTEx. Following, we selected genes based on endo lysosomal pathway related Gene Ontology terms and KEGG path ways. This step wise ï¬ltering resulted in 2236 endo lysosomal pathway related genes to be submitted to gene burden testing in search of novel candidate genes for FTD.

In human RS, there will always be numerous exons in any given panel where a sequence variation will not be available for quality control (QC). To overcome this problem we tested orangutan (OrU) as donor for QCreference materials. Since OrU NGS reads have only been obtained from whole genome sequencing (WGS) so far, information of how OrU/human sequence divergenceeffects targeted enrichment by human capture probes is limited. Here, we applied capture based whole exome sequencing (WES) panels from different suppliers to themale OrU cell line âEB185 JC â(Sigma Aldrich). As positive control, the male HapMap sample NA12877 was sequenced in parallel, along with a 1:1 gDNA mixture ofEB185 JC and NA12877. The reads were mapped to hg19, to the OrU reference sequence and to a combined hg19/OrU âmixâreference. Using this approach, we could show that OrU performs just as good as the competing human DNA. When mapped to the human reference, the OrU exome provides 903.763 variants (average 4.4 variants/WEStarget), and many of these would be disease causing if present in a human being. Therefore, OrU DNA can be used to measure both analytical and diagnostic sensitivity foralmost every human exon and exceeds the variant variety of NA12877 DNA (average 0.3 variants/WES target) by a factor of 13.5 fold. Therefore, OrU DNA is especiallyvaluable for small, disease focused NGS panels where human RS fail to provide enough variants for a reliable QC. A. Rump: None. F. Kuhlee: None. L. Gieldon: None. D.

A promising application is the sequencing of clinically relevant repeat structures in disorders such asALS, Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, and spinocerebellar ataxias. Increasing repeat units within sucha repeat locus are indicative of disease severity and age of onset, and are therefore of clinical importance. Due to the repetitive nature and length (up to several kilobases) it is hard to determine the exact structure of repeats with traditional sequencing technologies. Long read nanopore sequencing has the potential to overcome this problem bysequencing the entire disease locus including the full (expanded) repetitive region and associated epigenetic modiï¬cations. We present our work on the development and testing of a cost effective and comprehensive diagnostic test that targets clinically relevant repeat structures in one experiment. Thetest is based on multiplexed sequence enrichment of ten repeat loci using CRISPR Cas technology combined with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. We used this approach tosequence controls and patients and demonstrate that our approach is able to effectively enrich and sequence clini cally relevant genomic repeat structures. In comparison toour current diagnostic assays we show that the number of repeat units within these loci can be detected with high accuracy. M. G. Elferink: None. I. J. Renkens: None. D.

Conventional techniques (Sequencing of Sanger and MLPA) allow the detection of 40% of the cases that are carriers of inactivating mutations in heterozygosis in theRB1 gene. It is described that between 10 15% are mosaics for the disease. These techniques are not sensitive enough to1658identify variants in low proportion present in these cases. Our objective was to study patients with sporadic bilateral retinoblastoma using massive sequencing techniques (RB1 panel). Materials and Methods: We designed a RB1 panel (Roche NimbleGen) with 148,330 bp target sequence cov ered (83.2% of the RB1 gene) and performed genetic ana lysis of 10 patients with sporadic bilateral retinoblastoma in whom the mutation has not been identi ï¬ed by conventional techniques. Results: Genetic analysis with the RB1 panel allowed us to detect mosaicism in the RB1 gene of 3 patients in dif ferent percentages: 16.28% (RB1:NM_000321:c.1363C>T: p. R455*), 7.09% (RB1:NM_000321:c.1390 +2T>C) and 14.07% (RB1:NM_000321:c.2092_2093del:p. Arg698A lafs*22). 30% of the retinoblastomas analyzed were mosa ics for the disease.

30964,"Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, SwedenIntroduction: Next generation sequencing (NGS) is commonplace in today âs clinical practice. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) is routinely used for the detection of a wide range of variant types, including single nucleotide variants and copy numbervariations. Despite advances in the ï¬eld, most diagnostic NGS work ï¬ows suffer from a relatively low diagnostic yield (30 50%). This is partly due to the dif ï¬culty of predicting the pathogenicity of genetic variation. RNA sequencing offers a wide range of analyses complementary to WGS/WES: including differential expression analysis,and detection of alternatively spliced transcripts. These analyses may be used to evaluate non coding variants, aswell as to pinpoint affected genes and pathways. Herein we describe an RNA sequencing work ï¬ow designed to be used in a routine clinical setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate its usefulness on a wide range of patient cases. Materials and Methods: The pipeline uses publicly available software and databases to detect and presentfusion genes, monoallelic expression, alternative splicing and differential expression. RNA was extracted from blood samples, and neuronal stem cells from patients visitingClinical Genetics, and the Centre for Inherited Metabolic Diseases at Karolinska University hospital. Paired end sequences were generated using Illumina technology. Results: We present our pipeline, as well as our analysis of a variety of patient cases, including down syndrome patients and translocation carriers (germline and somatic).

30965,"The diagnostic rate for Mendelian diseases by whole exome sequencing (WES)is typically 20% 40%. The low rate ispartly because ES misses deep intronic or synonymous variants leading to aberrant splicing. In this study, we aimed to apply RNA sequencing (RNA seq) to ef ï¬ciently detect the aberrant splicings and their related variants. Aberrant splicing in biopsied muscles from six nemaline myopathy (NM) cases unresolved by WES were analyzed with RNA seq. Variants related to detected aberrant splicings were analyzed with Sanger sequencing. Detected variants were screened in NM patients unresolved by WES. We identi ï¬ed a novel deep intronic NEBvariant in one case, and another novel synonymous NEBvariant in three cases. The former variant was observed to be the most frequent among allNEBpathogenic variants in normal Japanese populations with a frequency of 1 in 178 (20 alleles in 3,552 individuals), but was previously unrecognized. Expandedscreening of the variant identi ï¬ed it in further four previously unsolved nemaline myopathy cases.

Our aim is to develop an RNA seq method that can be used in a clinical diagnostic laboratory and identifygenetic variants affecting RNA isoforms and gene. To this end, we have been comparing a number of RNA seq platforms to determine key aspects of their performance. Methods: T h eQ u a n t S e q3 ' m R N A s e qk i tb yL e x o g e nw a s used to develop an RNA seq method.

We evaluated three dif ferent PCR mastermixes and two library preparation meth ods, followed by 150 bp paired end sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina). The SsoAdvanced PreAmp Supermix (Bio Rad) resulted in superior homogenous coverage following multiplex PCR. No signi ï¬cant difference in coverage uniformity was observed between the Nextera DNA Flex and the Nexter aXT DNA library prep method (Illumina). In virtually all tested DNA samples (n ,393), 86.29% of the SNPs had a uniform coverage within 2 fold of the mean. Based on theSNP genotypes, DNA samples could unambiguously be discriminated.1660In conclusion, we designed and validated a novel sample tracking test for whole exome or genome sequencing.

With increased use of these tests, there is a critical need to make the resulting diagnostic reports extremely clear toavoid any misinterpretation. Target sequence coverage is a key quality control information for any diagnostic sequen cing test, since important clinical decisions are made basedon this data. If coverage is not suf ï¬cient even for a small region of a highly suspected candidate gene, a complemen tary sequencing test is needed to make sure that thepathogenic variant is not missed. To facilitate the coverage data interpretation by test pre scribers, we designed a novel easy to use visualization tool,CovReport. The concise coverage data summary generated by CovReport allows one glance assessment of the sequencing test performance. Moreover, exon level cover age information can be immediately appreciated and taken into consideration for further medical decisions. CovReport can be easily adapted by any diagnostic laboratory, since itdoes not require complex installation. The user friendly interface generates a graphic summary of coverage data that is directly amendable to the diagnostic report. In addition tothe stand alone version, we also provide the command line version of CovReport that can be integrated in any bioin formatics pipeline. CovReport is now part of the routineanalysis pipeline for all diagnostic tests by gene panels in our Department.

The remaining 5% of cases have compound heterozygous mutations with one deleted/converted SMN1 allele and one mutated allele. SMN1 mutation detection is complicated by the highly homo logous SMN2 gene, which remains a challenge in clinical practice for diagnosing SMA patients with a mutated allele. Methodologies: Nine unrelated families that received a SMA molecular diagnosis during 2011 2016 were enrolledin this study. Heterozygous deletions of SMN1 were detected by quantitative PCR, and suspected SMN muta tions were scanned through DNA sequencing. A newlydeveloped approach named as allelic speci ï¬c RT PCR method (AS RT PCR) was used to con ï¬rm whether the identi ï¬ed mutation occurred in SMN1 orSMN2 . Results: SixSMN1 mutations (c.683T>A, c.22_23insA, c.815A>G, c.19delG, c.551_552insA and c.401_402delAG) were identi ï¬ed in 8 families. The latter three are novel mutations that have not been previously reported. Three families carried the same mutation, c.22_23insA. A rare variant c.84C>T in one family found in SMN2 . Conclusions: This study demonstrated AS RT PCR to be a relatively simple and reliable method for the identi ï¬cation ofSMN1 subtle mutations.

WES is not effective for the detection of deep, intronic variants that affect pre mRNA splicing. Further more, WES does not provide direct insight into the effectsof detected variants on pre mRNA splicing. Recently, massively parallel mRNA sequencing (RNA seq) wassuccessfully used to identify pathogenic variants in patients lacking a molecular diagnosis (Kremer et al., 2017; Cummings et al., 2017) and therefore we have implemented RNA seq in our clinical diagnostic laboratory to help (i) identify pathogenic variants in WES mutation negative patients and (ii) investigate the effects of variants ofuncertain clinical signi ï¬cance (VUS) on pre mRNA spli cing. We will report our results on an initial series of 9 cases. RNA isolated from cultured skin ï¬broblasts and/or blood was subjected to RNA seq. In 3 cases we con ï¬rmed that the identi ï¬ed VUS affected pre mRNA splicing, resulting in a more accurate molecular diagnosis. Inaddition, in 2 cases we identi ï¬ed splicing abnormalities that had not been detected using other technologies. Both cases involved insertions of mobile elements deep inintronic sequences, causing complex mapping issues. Overall, our data suggest that RNA seq is not only well suited to the detection of intronic variants and rearrange ments that are not covered by WES but is also useful for the improved classi ï¬ cation of VUS identi ï¬ed using other molecular screens.

In particular, applica tions utilizing a probe based readout, offer a higher level of speciï¬city given the additional, speci ï¬c hybridization required to generate a signal. TaqMan probes are particularly useful for such applica tions and since their invention over 20 years ago, still comprise the most used probe type. TaqMan probes comprise dual labeled probes, typically labeled with a 5 âï¬uorophore and a 3 âlocated quencher. If the target sequence is ampli ï¬ed during PCR, the TaqMan probe will bind and the 5 â >3âexonuclease activity of the progressing Taq polymerase will gradually degrade the probe, releasing the ï¬urophore from the quencher and generating a signal.1662Extensive data and design rules exist for the design of TaqMan probes, however, little emphasis has been put on predicting the speci ï¬c process of degradation of TaqMan probes. But with the advent of novel designs of TaqMan probes, multiplexing formats and use of e.g. internal quencher types, the length and temperature dependence ofthe TaqMan degradation process have become increasingly important. To investigate the dynamics of degradation, we have designed and tested a large number of TaqMan and TaqMan like designs and show clear dependence on the probe sequence and length as well as assay conditions onthe processing of the probes. By using a combination of traditional designs and various internal labeling types we present a set of comprehensive and useful design ruleswhen the degradation parameters of a TaqMan probe is required to occur within a speci ï¬c frame.

RTL variance ranged between 0.97 and 0.039 among the three methods. These differences could be attributed to the different underlying principles in DNAextraction for each method.

Hyperactivated MTOR signaling is visible in FCDII, associated in up to 40% of cases with low allele fraction (AF) mosaic gain of function mutations in MTOR itself orother genes in the cascade.

Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from For malin Fixed, Paraf ï¬n Embedded (FPPE) or Fresh Frozen (FF) samples of forty ï¬ve surgically resected FCDII tissues. Whenever possible, matched DNA from non dysplasiaFFPE specimens (gliosis) or from the marginal area of FF tissue were also obtained. We used smMIPS to capture MTOR mutational hotspot (FFPE) or all (FF) exonicsequences and sent samples to Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Results: smMIPs showed median per base error rate 2.29e 03 (FFPE) and 1.16E 03 (FF).

Bronicki1,2 1CHEO, Ottawa, ON, Canada,2University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada Rapid technological advances have led to a substantial increase in the number of sequence variants detected in probands. A direct consequence of this is increased requestsfrom providers to test family members. In familial cascade testing, the targeted testing of a known sequence variant is offered to relatives of the proband to determine their ownrisks of developing the pathology, and results may impact clinical management. Consequently, a consistent approach to maintain up to date variant classi ï¬cation in the context of familial testing is fundamental to provide appropriate patient care and management. We surveyed 21 clinical laboratories across Canada and the United States to identify variant re interpretation workï¬ows when performing familial testing. We also ana lyzed internal data of all familial testing performed by ourlaboratory in one year. While most laboratories agreed that ideally all variants should be re interpreted every time they are detected in apatient, that is not a feasible goal given limited resources. Our survey of laboratories found no clear consensus on when variant re interpretation is performed; some variablesincluded the variant classi ï¬cation, whether the variant was detected in the family member, and whether the original proband had been tested by the performing laboratory. Thereview of our internal data showed that of the familial variants re interpreted (n ,107), 11% had a clinically sig niï¬cant change in classi ï¬cation, highlighting the impor tance of continuing to re interpret variants tested in this context.

The ï¬rst patient presented with learning dif ï¬culties and autism spectrum disorder, but had been found to have an incidental 1.7 kbimbalance which included a partial duplication of VHL exon 3. This was inherited from the patient âs father, who had renal cancer aged 38 years. In the second case, we identi ï¬ed an incidental 200 kb duplication which included DMD exons 30 44. Parental testing was consistent with this variant having arisen de novo . In both cases, the single molecule sequencing yielded suf ï¬cient information to deï¬ne precisely the architecture of the rearranged region, enabling Sanger sequencing assays across the integrationsites and surrounding homologous regions (that likely gave rise to the duplicated sequences). Adoption of this approach by diagnostic laboratories promises to enable rapid andcost effective characterisation of challenging duplication containing alleles. C. M. Watson: None. L. A.

30977,"Hospital, Odense, Denmark Introduction: Structural variants (SVs) are known to be associated with severe genetic disorders. Currently used methods to identify SVs include conventional karyotyping,FISH and microarrays. Yet no method provides both high resolution and identi ï¬cation of balanced variants. We studied the potential of low coverage WGS for ï¬ne mapping breakpoints of SVs by comparing different SV analysis software. Materials and Methods: Low coverage WGS was per formed on 8 samples with previously detected different SVs using KAPA HyperPlus PCR free library preparation kit (Roche) and NextSeq 550 (Illumina) sequencing platform. Mean genome coverage was 8.5X. Breakpoint analysis was done by manual genome exploration using IGV software and by automatic SV callers: VarSeq (Golden Helix) andDelly2. Results: Delly2 software predicted breakpoints for all 8 known SVs including complex variants. VarSeq aided inï¬nding better de ï¬ned breakpoints than microarray for all SVs with copy number variations, however it was not sui table for balanced events. Furthermore, by manuallyexploring the region of interest using IGV we could provide better characterization of known SVs and pinpoint break points at single base precision. Conclusion: Using currently available software, it is possible to detect breakpoints at single base level if the approximate SV region is known. However, the best resultswere achieved when called breakpoints were manually inspected on genome visualization software. For now, SV analysis from low coverage WGS data could be used tosupplement conventional methods where identifying a pre cise breakpoint can provide clinically relevant information. I.

Rolfs1 1Centogene AG, Rostock, Germany,2King Abdulaziz Medical City WR, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,3King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Introduction: Whole exome sequencing is an ef ï¬cient tool for the study of monogenic disorders. However, incon clusive results are often obtained due to the lack of speci ï¬c clinical information and/or the identi ï¬cation of variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance, which do not allow to con ï¬rm a genetic diagnosis in the absence of further testing. As aresult, the ""diagnostic odyssey"" for patients may be signiï¬cantly extended in time. This study focuses on the validation of genetic results by means of biochemicalanalyses. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed for 24 patients coming from different geo graphical regions. The results obtained by sequencing were validated in parallel through biochemical analyses: quanti ï¬cation of the corresponding enzyme activity and/or biomarker. Results: Sequencing analyses revealed the presence of variants with known clinical relevance (previously reportedin the literature) and previously undescribed variants in 14 genes associated with lysosomal storage disorders. The combination of genetic and biochemical results con ï¬rmed the pathogenicity of previously undescribed variants and the pathogenicity of those variants previously known. In two cases, the diagnosis was con ï¬rmed despite the lack of speciï¬c clinical information and with only the detection of intronic variants, which would have otherwise been classi ï¬ed as variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance. Conclusions: The whole exome sequencing approach can be greatly reinforced by performing biochemical analyses in parallel. The combination of these two methods increasesthe diagnostic yield of genetic disorders even at initial stages in which the clinical signs are still unspeci ï¬c. This may also allow starting early pharmacological/non phar macological treatments. A. Bertoli Avella: A. Employment (full or part time); Signi ï¬cant; Centogene AG. M. Calvo: A.

We identi ï¬ed an infant with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) who manifested with typical dysmorphic facies and limb reduction defects, yet chromo somal microarray and exome sequencing from both wholeblood and buccal samples were noncontributory. Materials and Methods: G banding chromosome ana lysis was followed by PCR free whole genome sequencing(WGS) at an average read depth of 30X. WGS data was utilized to ï¬ne map the rearrangement breakpoints. The disease associated breakpoint junction was validated bybreakpoint junction PCR. Results: Chromosome analysis revealed a de novo com plex balanced translocation, 46,XY,t(5;7;6)(q11.2;q32;q13)dn. The reported cytogenetic breakpoints did not involve any of the known CdLS associated genes, prompting us to perform breakpoint analysis by WGS. Twenty six break points were identi ï¬ed by WGS, delineating segments derived from four chromosomes (5;6;7;21) in ancestral or inverted orientation. One of the breakpoints disruptedNIPBL , on 5p13.2, providing molecular correlation for the clinical diagnosis of CdLS. Conclusion: WGS provides a unique opportunity to unravel the basis of genetic disorders not resolved by rou tine laboratory methods, and to shed light on the genomicmechanisms involved in the pathogenesis. The rearrange ments identi ï¬ed in this case were by far more complex than what was suggested by traditional G banding chromosome analysis, allowing for identi ï¬cation of the underlying molecular diagnosis and implicating chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis in the formation of the balancedtranslocations.

Recent data indicates that whole genome sequencing (WGS) may be used as acomprehensive test to identify multiple types of pathologic genetic aberrations in a single analysis. We present FindSV, a bioinformatic pipeline for detection of balanced (inversions and translocations) and unbalanced (deletions and duplications) structural variants (SVs). First,1666FindSV was tested on 106 validated deletions and dupli cations with a median size of 850 kb (min: 511 bp, max: 155 Mb). All variants were detected. Second, we demon strated the clinical utility in 138 monogenic WGS panels. SV analysis yielded 11 diagnostic ï¬ndings (8%). Remark ably, a complex structural rearrangement involving twoclustered deletions disrupting SCN1A ,SCN2A , and SCN3A was identi ï¬ed in a three months old girl with epileptic encephalopathy. Finally, 100 consecutive samples referredfor clinical microarray were also analyzed by WGS. The WGS data was screened for large (>2 kbp) SVs genome wide, processed for visualization in our clinical routinearrayCGH work ï¬ow with the newly developed tool vcf2cytosure, and for exonic SVs and SNVs in a panel of 700 genes linked to intellectual disability. We also appliedshort tandem repeat (STR) expansion detection and dis covered one pathologic expansion in ATXN7 . The diag nostic rate (29%) was doubled compared to clinicalmicroarray (12%). In conclusion, using WGS we have detected a wide range of structural variation with high accuracy, con ï¬rming it a powerful comprehensive genetic test in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) has become a robust and cost effective approach for clinical genetic testing of small sequence variants; detectionof CNVs within WES data became possible with thedevelopment of algorithms that enable comparing coverage between probands and controls. In this study, we express the challenges and feasibility of analysing CNVs using WES data. We performed WES on patients with rare genetic disorders and analysed SNVs, using an in house pipeline, and CNVs, using Golden Helix âs VarSeq software. Probable causative CNVs were con ï¬rmed by qPCR or MLPA. In recessive disorders with a causative heterozygous SNV, ï¬ne tuning of CNV analysis for each gene was performed on acase by case basis. During 2017, we detected 12 CNVs as probably causative in 122 patients, but only one was conï¬rmed by qPCR, a rate of 91.7% false positives (FPs). After optimising regions of interest and using CNVs of healthy controls, from public and internal CNV databases, many common CNVs and FPs were ï¬ltered. Then, over the past year, we detected 123 CNVs in 1251 patients as likely causative, 41 of which were con ï¬rmed by qPCR or MLPA (66.7% FPs). We identi ï¬ed probable disease causing CNVs using WES data in 3.3% of patients. Con ï¬rmation by orthogonal methodologies validated the software analysis pipeline and the CNVs detected, showing that combiningSNV and CNV analysis improves the molecular diagnosis of patients with rare Mendelian diseases.

The 37 SNPs were previously included in a larger panel, to date used for zygosity analysis in 12800 twin pairs from the Swedish Twin Registry. The goal for the new panel was to develop a one reaction assay,to replace the larger three reaction assay, containing targets with the highest minor allele frequencies based on results from 25000 investigated samples.

Odds ratiosfor MZ score using the new panel and the original panel was greater than 6x10 6and 6x107, respectively. Odds ratios for dizygotic score (DZ) was 0 for both panels. Using the newpanel, 308 of the 310 twin pairs could be analyzed while 304 twin pairs could be analyzed with the original panel.

ATS therapiesare currently only delaying the progression of symptoms. We present here a stable approach using AAV CRISPR/ Cas9 technology. We have recently proven that podocytes lineage cells the key cells in ATS pathogenesis, the only ones to express COL4 Î±3 Î±4 Î±5 heterotrimer can beisolated from urine samples of ATS patients. Taking advantage of disease relevant cell lines, we employed an two plasmid approach in order to achieve a mutation speciï¬c correction, suitable for AAV infection. The ï¬rst plasmid carries a Donor DNA, the template for the cor rection, and a reporter system mCherry/GFP to track theactivity of Cas9 in the cells. The second plasmid carries a self cleaving SpCas9 and the mutation speci ï¬c sgRNA. In two stable podocytes lineage cell lines, harboring a muta tion in COL4A5 (p.(Gly624Asp)) and a mutation in COL4A3 (p.(Gly856Glu)), we achieved a reversion of the mutation greater than 30% and insertions/deletions, limitedto the mutated allele, lower than 40%.

Understanding genetic mechanisms for candidaemia susceptibility may aid in designing host directed therapies. Materials and Methods: We performed the ï¬rst genome wide association study on candidaemia using the largest patient cohort available today. By using apopulation based cohort of 500 healthy volunteers, we proï¬led cytokines in Candida stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whole blood, and macrophages. Byusing these cytokine pro ï¬les and genetic data, we mapped Candida response cytokine QTLs, and tested if they are associated with susceptibility. Finally, we tested if candi daemia loci modulating cytokines have an impact on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by using an independent population based cohort. Results: We observed strong association between candi daemia and a genetic variant, which signi ï¬cantly affects the expression levels of PLA2G4B in blood. We found that up to 35% of the susceptibility loci affect in vitro cytokine production in response to Candida . Furthermore, potential causal genes located within these loci are enriched for lipidand arachidonic acid metabolism. We also showed that the numbers of risk alleles at these loci are negatively correlated with ROS and IL 6 levels in response to Candida . Finally, there was a signi ï¬cant correlation between ROS and allelic scores based on 16 independent candidaemia associated SNPs that affect monocyte derived cytokines, but not withT cell derived cytokines. Conclusions: Our results prioritize the disturbed lipid homeostasis and oxidative stress as potential mechanismsthat affect monocyte derived cytokines to in ï¬uence candi daemia susceptibility. V.

We aimed to investigated whether a previously reported gene pro ï¬le for inï¬iximab could also be applied to adalimumab response. Materials and Methods: Inï¬amed and non in ï¬amed colon biopsy samples from 47 Slovenian Crohn's diseasepatients indicated for adalimumab (ADA) were obtained during routine colonoscopy prior to ADA treatment. Response to adalimumab was determined using IBDQ. RT qPCR was employed to measure gene expression in colon biopsy samples. Genotypes were extracted from previously available data. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSSsoftware. Bootstrap aggregated support vector machines (SVM) were trained using R package e1071. Results: Pooled, non in ï¬amed colon tissue and in ï¬amed colon tissue gene expression datasets were used to train the SVM prediction models using IBDQ response after 4, 12, 20 and 30 weeks of ADA treatment as prediction target. Pooled and in ï¬amed datasets achieved an average of 75.5% and 90.5% ADA response prediction accuracy, respectively. Non in ï¬amed tissue dataset achieved 100% ADA response prediction accuracy. Moreover, SVM trained on selected SNPs and LD mates from analyzed genes had an average accuracy of 92.8%, con ï¬rming involvement of analyzed genetic regions. Finally, combined expression and genotype data showed 100% ADA response prediction accuracy for all datasets. Conclusions: Our results support the reported genetic anti TNF response pro ï¬le.

Therefore, anti TNF monoclonal antibodies have shown an increased ef ï¬cacy over conventional therapies. However, therapy with TNF inhibitors is ineffective in up to 30% of patients and the variety of therapeutic effects may re ï¬ect individual genetic backgrounds of patients. The aim of our study was to ï¬nd new pharmacogenetics markers and mechanisms of response to anti TNF inhibitor adalimumab in well deï¬ned cohort of Crohn âs disease (CD) patients. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 102 CD patients on adalimumab for which response has been de ï¬ned after 4, 12, 20 and 30 weeks of treatment. SNPs, previously asso ciated with response to anti TNF treatment, were geno typed. Functional prediction has been performed forsigniï¬cantly associated genes. Results: After four weeks of treatment, strong statistically signiï¬cant association has been con ï¬rmed for SNP rs3740691 in gene ARFGAP2 . In a group of patients with genotype AA or AG there were 59,6% of nonresponders compared to 15,1 % of nonresponders in a group of patientswith genotype GG ( p,1,20E 05). Furthermore, after four weeks of treatment, average IBDQ value in patients with genotype AA or AG reached only 158,3 points compared to183,7 points in patients with genotype GG ( p,2,74E 04). The difference remained signi ï¬cant also after 12 weeks of treatment.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) liquid biopsy analysis holds promise as a minimally invasive multipurpose biomarker. In this pilotstudy, we investigate ctDNA monitoring in OC. Material and Methods: Twelve OC patients from Keio Women âs Health Biobank at Keio University School of Medicine were studied: the histological subtypes comprised eight serous, two clear cell, one mucinous and one endo metrioid. Diagnostic tumor and serial peripheral bloodsamples were collected. Following identi ï¬cation of tumor mutations, we performed quantitative detection of ctDNA in plasma from various timepoints using the ultrasensitiveIBSAFE method. Results: Concordant mutations in tumor DNA and plasma DNA were detected in eleven patients (91%); onlyone mutation in a non recurrent patient was undetectable in plasma. Among the ï¬ve recurrent patients, all patients detected positive ctDNA prior to or simultaneously to CTimaging. Positive ctDNA was detected earlier than high CA125 in 3/5 patients with a median of 86 days. ctDNA also had sensitive reaction to tumor burden during che motherapy. ctDNA from all seven non recurrent patients turned negative after initial treatment and maintained negative throughout the follow up.

30989,"Institute for Anthropological Research, Zagreb, CroatiaIntroduction: CYP2D6 enzyme is involved in the metabolism of approximately 25% of the most commonlyprescribed drugs metabolized in liver (opioids, beta blockers, antidepressants, antitumor agent, etc.). CYP2D6has the largest phenotypical variability among all CYP âs due to the substantial number of polymorphisms that impact its activity. This gene shows population speci ï¬c variation. Aim: to determine variation within CYP2D6 among three socio culturally and geographically distinct Croatian Roma groups (Balkan Roma and Vlax Roma from Baranja andMedjimurje) since their speci ï¬c population history highly inï¬uenced their gene pool. Methods: NGS method Genotyping in Thousands by sequencing was used to sequence whole CYP2D6 gene on 324 Croatian Roma DNA samples. Polymorphic positons were phased using PHASE v2.1.1. Reconstructed haplo types were translated into star alleles according to P450 Allele Nomenclature Database. Results: Sequencing identi ï¬ed 51 polymorphic positions. Reconstructed haplotypes signi ï¬cantly differed among the three Roma groups (p<0.05). The two most frequent hap lotypes in Balkan Roma belong to the groups of CYP2D6*4and CYP2D6*1 alleles (9.7% and 8.7% respectively), while in Roma from Baranja the most frequent haplotypes belong to groups of CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*2 alleles (18.8% and10.3% respectively). The most frequent haplotypes in Roma from Medjimurje belong to the groups of CYP2D6*1 and CYP2D6*4 alleles (14.4% and 7.4% respectively). Conclusion: Our results provided basic information about CYP2D6 polymorphisms, suggesting that the enzy matic activities of CYP2D6 might differ among Roma groups. This ï¬nding may be helpful for better modulation of pharmacotherapy in Roma population. The research was funded by Croatian Science Foundation grant (HRZZ IP 2014 09 4454) to MPS. A.

Clinical interventions can thus be conducted to improve future health outcomes inpatients and their at risk relatives, such as predicting late onset genetic disorders accessible to prevention or treat ment, or identifying differential drug ef ï¬cacy and safety. Material and Methods: To evaluate the interest of pharmacogenetics information, we designed an Â« in house Â» pipeline to determine the status for 122 PharmGKB (Phar macogenomics Knowledgebase) variants, including struc tural variations for the genes of interest. This pipeline was applied in a cohort of 82 epileptic patients to determine thefrequency of pharmacogenetics variants of interest for managing the treatment. Plasma concentrations and treat ment was retrospectively assessed by clinical history. Results: For the PharmGKB class IA variants, the CYP2C9 status for phenytoin âs prescription was the only relevant information. One low and twenty three inter mediate metabolizers were identi ï¬ed respectively in our cohort, nineteen patients were treated by phenytoin. While being treated with a standard protocol (15mg/kg loadingdose followed by 5mg/kg maintenance dose), 3 out of the 4 identi ï¬ed intermediate metabolizers had experienced plasma concentration above the toxic range (30 mg/L). Conclusion: Genotyping of CYP2C9 could have antici pated the risk of clinical toxicity caused by high phenytoin plasma levels. Pangenomic sequencing can provide infor mation about common pharmacogenetic variants in epilep tic patients likely to be useful for their pharmacological management. S. verdez: None. P. Garret: None.

Rolfs Centogene AG, Rostock, Germany Introduction: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder which is highly variable as regards age at onset and clinical manifestation. An enzymatic assay has long been1672used as a rather reliable diagnostic aid in GD, but we recently revealed even better diagnostic performance of dried bloods spot (DBS) based quanti ï¬cation of the sphingosine Lyso Gb1. We were therefore interested in determining whether this biomarker can also be used to reï¬ect disease severity. Materials and Methods: A large cohort of individuals with genetically con ï¬rmed GD was compiled from Cen togene âs proprietary mutation database CentoMD Â®. Free text clinical descriptions from the initial diagnostic requests (i.e. before genetic diagnosis and before initiation of treat ment) were translated into human phenotype ontology(HPO) terms. Lyso Gb1 levels in the corresponding sam ples were quanti ï¬ed by mass spectrometry. Result: A median of 4 HPO terms (range 1 to 19) had been assigned per patient. Biomarker levels were lowest in patients with a single HPO term, and increased by ~15% per additional term (up to n ,5 terms). Strati ï¬cation of terms according to clinical categories revealed that patients with mild or sub clinical corresponding signs (e.g. thrombocy topenia) had lower Lyso Gb1 levels than patients with amore severe manifestation (e.g. thrombocytopenia + excessive bleeding, thrombocytopenia +epistaxis). Conclusion: In addition to its diagnostic value, Lyso Gb1 accurately re ï¬ects disease severity in GD. Considering feasibility of DBS based quanti ï¬cation, it thereby lends itself as the ideal biomarker for long term follow up andtherapeutic monitoring of GD patients. P. Bauer: A.

Popularly, hybrid capture based sequencing methods are used for screening largenumber of targets, which tend to be tedious, laborious, requiring trained operators with specialized equipment and the complex protocols resulting in increased errors. Tosimplify screening, we developed amplicon based Clean PlexÂ®technology, which enables high quality genomic coverage using a fast, simple, and streamlined NGS librarypreparation work ï¬ow. We present our Hereditary Cancer panel to quickly detect mutations associated with increased hereditary cancer risks, covering full exons of 37 targetedgenes in one reaction. Methods: CleanPlex technology has a 3 step work ï¬ow: targeted multiplex PCR step, background cleaning step toremove by products, and ï¬nally indexing PCR to add Illu mina Â®adapter sequences and sample indexes. 10 ng of input genomic DNA per pool (40 ng total) was used andlibraries sequenced at ~2,500 read depth using Illumina NextSeq Â®. After demultiplexing, mapping rates and on target rates were calculated, and variants were identi ï¬ed using Paragon Genomics âvariant calling algorithm.1674Results: The results exhibit >96% uniformity at 0.2X mean, and all exons were covered to provide accurate var iant calling. The assay is highly reproducible and sensitive, with an R2 value of 0.95 between independently prepared replicates, and a detection rate of >99% for single nucleo tide variants. Conclusion: CleanPlex Hereditary Cancer Panel can be used for rapid and accurate pro ï¬ling of cancer risk with very small DNA input.

Elevated plasma levels of rosuvasta tin have been associated with increased risk of statininduced myopathy, leading to non adherence and compro mising treatment and management of hypercholesterolemia. Pharmacogenetics plays a well established role in both interindividual and interethnic variation in rosuvastatin plasma levels. Historically the pharmacogenetics of rosu vastatin has been dominated by the transporter genes, Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family member 1B1 (SCO1B1 )ATP Binding Cassette G2 (ABCG2 ). The single nucleotide polymorphisms SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (rs4149056, p. Val174Ala) and ABCG2 c.421C>A (rs2231142, p. Gln141Lys), in particular are associated withincreased plasma levels of rosuvastatin. However, these pharmacogenetic studies had minimal representation from individuals of African descent. Materials and Methods: To investigate the pharmaco genetics of rosuvastatin in African populations; we ï¬rst screened 785 individuals from nine ethnic African popula tions for the SLCO1B1 c.521C and ABCG2 c.421CA var iants. We then sequenced whole exomes from individuals of African Bantu descent, who participated in a 20mg rosu vastatin pharmacokinetic trial in Harare Zimbabwe. Results: Frequencies of SLCO1B1 c.521C ranged from 0.0% (San) to 7.0% (Maasai), whilst ABCG2 c.421A ranged from 0.0% (Shona) to 5.0% (Kikuyu).

Patients with LS have an increased risk of cancer development. Estimated risk by the1676age of 70y.o. for non polyposis colorectal cancer (CRC) is up to 82%, endometrial cancer 60%, gastric cancer 13%, etc. LS is caused by mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM genes. Prevalence of LS is 1:1000. The goal is to de ï¬ne the role of molecular genetic testing and medical genetic counseling in patients with CRC. Materials and Methods: Case report of 36 year old male patient with Non polyposis CRC. The bowel obstruction had occurred in 4 generations of his family. Patient âs brother developed CRC at 27y.o., mother at 49 and at 60y. o. Grandmother and grand grandfather died of CRC at 62 and 45 years respectively. Meanwhile, proband has 4 chil dren (4 10y.o.).

Here, we performed a molecular and immunohistochemical characterization of key mTOR path way components in a series of 113 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with everolimus or temsirolimus,aimed at identifying markers of treatment response. Mutational analysis in MTOR ,TSC1 and TSC2 was performed through targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for PTEN, pAKT, pS6K1, pS6 and p21. Among 89 patients with NGS data, 13.5% had mTOR pathway mutations (9% MTOR ,1 % TSC1 ,3 % TSC2 ), with the mutation rate decreasing to 8% when only considering pathogenic variants, and with a multiregion NGS analysis in 14 patients giving homogenous results. When comparing themolecular data with the RECIST response of the patients, we found that partial response was more frequent in cases with mTOR pathway mutations than in those withoutmutations (67% versus 21%, P ,0.020). Regarding IHC, negative PTEN staining was detected in 58% of the tumors, and it was more frequent in rapalog responder patients(P,0.024). Mutations and PTEN IHC were not mutually exclusive events and its combination improved response prediction (P ,0.013). The staining of other proteins did not show and association with response and no association with PFS was observed for none of the markers analyzed. In conclusion, our study supports mTOR pathway mutations,negative PTEN IHC, and their combination, as markers of rapalog response, proving a step forward the personalization of RCC treatment. J.

Heterozygous pathogenic variants in the NF2 gene are known to cause NF2, whereby somatic mosaicism is present in ~25% of simplex patients. In schwannomatosis,a disorder phenotypically similar to NF2, heterozygous SMARCB1 orLZTR1 variants may be causative. Recently, bevacizumab has shown ef ï¬ciency as therapy for VS in some NF2 patients. We report on a thirty three year old patient with bilateral VS, fourteen additional schwannomas and one intracranial meningioma. Next generation sequen cing using the TruSight Cancer Panel and Sanger sequen cing of LZTR1 on blood and oral mucosa DNA revealed no pathogenic variants in NF2,SMARCB1 orLZTR1 . Sanger sequencing on DNA from three schwannomas identi ï¬ed the known nonsense variant c.784C>T;p.(R262*) of NF2 (NM_000268.3, GRCh37/hg19) in all tumors, leading tothe diagnosis of NF2 mosaicism. Because of hearing impairment and tumor progression the patient underwent an off label therapy with 5mg/kg bevacizumab. Here, weevaluated MRI scans from ï¬ve pre therapeutic and two therapeutic years and pure tone audiometry. After 25 months of treatment, the pure tone average decreasedby 7.5dB, indicating a hearing bene ï¬t. Four of seven non vestibular schwannomas showed volume reduction of â¥20% after 24 months of treatment while the growth rate of themeningioma decreased. In conclusion, in a patient with NF2 somatic mosaicism, an off label therapy with bev acizumab was ef ï¬cient with respect to hearing improvement and tumor shrinkage of some non vestibular schwannomas over a period of two years.

Those people are more inclined to develop cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) which aregenetic and chronic multifactorial diseases. We performed a genetic screen over 3000 patients tested in 2018 from theMediterranean area by using the MassARRAY Â®method that simultaneously analyses 30 genes variations per sample. The genes investigated in our study were previously established to increase the likelihood of developing obesity, CVD and T2D. Three groups of genes were then created from disease related genes variants with at least one high risk allele (12 for obesity, 5 for T2D and 4 for CVD). Our ï¬nding suggests that risk alleles frequency for obesity dependent genes such as FTO,SH2B1 andADRB2 have a higher incidence within the tested population with respect to the WT allele. CVD and T2D related genes such as MnSOD2 and TCF7L2 showed a similar incidence. We additionally ï¬nd that 65% of tested samples for FTO high risk allele had at least one high risk allele for either or both MnSOD2 and TCF7L2 . Thus, people genetically predis posed to develop obesity can be also inclined to develop CVD or/and T2D. The incidence of those diseases could be decreased in the future by combining the genetic screenswith balanced diets and physical activity. Speci ï¬cally, the genetic screen can raise awareness of developing deadly diseases especially in high risk people. L. Walczer Baldinazzo: None. S. Caporilli: None. L. Gualdi: None. C.

We have used pathway based approach to comprehensively evaluate the in ï¬uence of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of key dopaminergic pathway genes on the occurrence of AEs of DT in PD. Material and Methods: We recruited 231 PD patients on DT and collected data on their AEs: sleep attacks, visual hallucinations, nausea/vomiting, orthostatic hypotension,peripheral oedema, impulse control disorders, motor ï¬uc tuations and dyskinesia. We genotyped patients for the following SNPs: COMT rs4680, rs165815, DDC rs921451, rs3837091, MAOB rs1799836, DRD2 rs1801028, rs1799732, DRD3 rs6280, SLC6A3 rsrs393795, rs6347,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1679rs104209, SLC22A1 rs628031, SLC18A2 rs14240, and SV2C rs1423099.

They also represent~18% of the total US population 1. While pharmacogenomic (PGx) markers have been well characterized for certain ethnicities, little has been published on the frequency ofrelevant PGx genotype and phenotype rates in latinos. Materials and Methods: Attendees of the 2018 ALAMP conference were asked to participate in this study andsubsequently consented to receiving pharmacogenomic testing using the RightMed Â®Comprehensive test (OneOme, USA). 146 predominantly latino participants completed thestudy. Participants were tested for 27 pharmacogenes and received genotype derived recommendations for more than 360 medications as well as a genotype and phenotypesummaries. Medications on each report were binned into red (major drug gene interactions), yellow (moderate) and green (minimal). Results: Participants averaged 8 red medications (major interaction), and every participant had at least 1 major ormoderate drug gene interaction identi ï¬ed. Of interest, 20% of participants were intermediate metabolizers of clopido grel, indicating a loss of function allele in CYP2C19. In addition, 34% carried the SLC6A4 S/S genotype, associated with lowered tolerability of SSRIs, and 45% were carriers of UGT1A1 variants, posing a severe risk of neutropeniaand toxicity for those with certain chemotherapy regimens. Conclusion: For PGx to become standard of care in medicine, it is imperative that different ethnic groups berepresented in the literature and ultimately, in professional guidelines. Through this study, we have made strides to characterize the latino pharmacogenomic pro ï¬le, which will in turn help to stratify patients for PGx testing. B. Esquivel: A.

31007,"Genomics, IMED Biotech Unit, Astrazeneca, Melbourn, United Kingdom Introduction: In 2016 AstraZeneca launched a company wide genomics initiative aiming to integrate genomicsthroughout the drug discovery and development pipelines. The initiative will analyse up to 2 million genomes, including sequencing of 500,000 patients participating incompany sponsored clinical trials. To achieve this, novel processes and documentation had to be rapidly embedded across therapeutic areas, replacingrestricted, study speci ï¬c pharmacogenetic samples with broadly consented genomic samples allowing use across health related research. Methods: Three steps were employed to enable this strategy: 1) a novel role was created to operationally support study teams and monitor implementation; 2) a dedicatedmailbox was set up as a primary point of contact for genomics queries and advice; 3) training material, face to face âworking groups âand training sessions were rolled out across the organisation. To assess the impact of these measures, the inclusion of genomic sample collection across clinical studies was audited. Results: During 2018 over 1400 email items, addressing queries from 53 different study teams were received and resolved in the genomics mailbox and 13 formal trainingsessions were held with more than 250 attendees from multiple company functions including clinical teams,1680operational leads, data managers and process owners. Implementation of these measures resulted in 150% increase in the number of studies collecting genomic sam ples (60% of all AZ studies) with over 14,000 patients approached. Conclusion: A genomics initiative, collecting broadly consented samples, can be successfully embedded within a global organisation by dedicating resources that raise awareness and provide a robust support structure forstudy teams.

Swen1 1Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands, 2Z Index, The Hague, Netherlands,3Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Pharmacogenetics is one of the ï¬rst clinical applications of personalized medicine. However, in currentclinical practice it is often used retrospectively, while patients may bene ï¬t most from preemptive testing [1]. Increasing use of Next Generation Sequencing offers newopportunities for large scale implementation of pharmaco genetics in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for children and their parents is routinely performed for diagnosis of certain medical conditions. We created a post processing procedure that phases all variants based ontrio analysis. The pharmacogenetics pro ï¬le is extracted from approximately 200 phased variants in 12 genes. Patients are offered a personal card with a QR code thatcontains the pro ï¬le. On access of their personal page, the drug metabolizer phenotype is predicted, and individual drug recommendations are generated based on the monthlyupdated national drug database G Standaard [2]. Results: In this multicenter project we developed a sys tem that reuses diagnostic WES data for pharmacogenetics. The systems consists of a platform to deliver pharmacoge netic pro ï¬les extracted from diagnostic WES data, together with a website that provides personalized drug recommen dations established by the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Work ing Group. Preliminary analysis yields pharmacogenetic recommendations for 1321 out of 1845 pro ï¬les (72%). Conclusions: Our system allows for large scale imple mentation of clinical pharmacogenetics for patients thatundergo WES. The recommendation system is agnostic of the genotyping method and designed to work with other methods.

Being a chronic and disabling disorder, it requires lifelong medication, that subsequently triggers metabolic Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). This project aims to identify novel biomarkers that maycontribute to the short term prediction of metabolic dysfunctions associated with antipsychotic treatments. Materials and Methods: A clinical trial with healthy volunteers was carried out to evaluate the short term effect (5 days) of olanzapine and aripiprazole. Each volunteer received both treatments separated by one month of wash out. Blood samples were collected before and after the treatment. A total of 16 samples were analysed withAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1681Illumina total RNA Seq technology, followed by a differ ential expression analysis. Results: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that aripiprazole upregulated TNF Î±/NFKB signalling (p <0.001), that controls in ï¬ammatory response, which also became upregulated (p <0.05). Chronic in ï¬ammation is associated with obesity, a feature of the metabolic syn drome. TNFAIP2 that is regulated by proin ï¬ammatory molecules, increased its expression with aripiprazole (p , 0.0001, Wald test). Olanzapine treatment repressed SNARE proteins (p <0.005), that facilitates glucose uptake, which disruption is also affected by insulin resistance. Amongthem, VAMP8 was the most downregulated gene (p ,0.01, Wald test). Other validations are ongoing. Conclusions: Our results suggest that aripiprazole could be related to the upregulation of chronic in ï¬ammatory response, while olanzapine may induce insulin resistance through SNARE proteins repression. TNFAIP2 andVAMP8 could be candidate biomarkers for the short term prediction of metabolic ADRs. This project was funded by the EU Framework Horizon 2020 under GA 721236. M. Ruiz Rosario: None. P.

We hypothesize that genetic risk information would improve prevention, diag nosis and treatment. Materials and Methods: We validated the polygenic risk scores in whole genome genotyped population based FIN RISK cohorts (N ,20.000) using Cox regression models. Follow up data from national health care registers allowed us to model the impact of genetic and traditional risk factorssuch as smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and BMI on a person's risk of disease within the next 10 years. Results: We observed that type 2 diabetes (T2DM) PRS signiï¬cantly associates with the T2DM disease risk (HR:1.5 per 1 sd PRS, p value:<2*10 16). Also the top 8% of the FINRISK population who had inherited the highest PRS had fourfold increased risk for T2DM. Moreover, people with >35 BMI and the highest PRS tend to get diabetes atyounger age. Conclusions: FINRISK cohorts produced estimates on the impact of PRS and selected covariates on risk of T2DM. We use these estimates to assess the future risk of T2DM in P5.ï¬FinHealth participants.

PS rely on contributions of many associated alleles extrapolated from GWAS, which are partly population dependent. This poses serious limitations to the applic ability of PS to admixed individuals, where at least one of the mixing ancestry comes from an understudied popula tion. In this case, different portions of the genome should betreated differently, to account for the population speci ï¬c nature of the association signals. Here we introduce Ancestry Speci ï¬c Partial PS, a novel approach that computes partial PS on ancestry speci ï¬c chromosomal segments, obtained through local ancestry deconvolution. We ï¬rst assess what are the effects of taking only a fraction of the genome to compute a PS, how to take into account the uncertainty deriving from the missing part,1682and Partial PS behavior across populations. Then we apply this method on populations with admixed African and West Eurasian ancestry where, with a standard whole genome approach, no reliable PS can be computed for the reasons mentioned above. Using Partial PS we could retrieve in simulated individuals part of the total PS predictivity inproportion to the European ancestry fraction and up to 80% in modern Egyptians, whose West Eurasian component is close to 80%. These results may inform the applicability ofPS to subjects that are currently left out of the personalized medicine revolution due to their complex, individual history of admixture.

Ridotrine infusion can result in serious maternal complication, and pulmonary edema is a special concern among the complications. The cause ofpulmonary edema following ritodrine treatment is multi factorial, but the contributing genetic factors remain under studied. This study investigates the genetic variantsassociated with ritodrine induced pulmonary edema. Materials and Methods: In this case control study, 16 patients who developed pulmonary edema during ritodrineinfusion [case] and 16 pregnant women who were treated with ritodrine but did not develop pulmonary edema [con trol] were included. Control pregnant women were selectedafter matching for plurality and gestational age at use of tocolytics. Maternal blood was taken at the time of admis sion for tocolytics, and whole exome sequencing was per formed with stored blood samples. Results: A total of 71 candidate genes were selected by comparing the cumulative effects of multiple coding var iants between patients with pulmonary edema and matched controls for 19729 protein coding genes. Subsequent data analysis selected only statistically signi ï¬cant and deleter ious variants with a role compatible with ritodrine inducedpulmonary edema. Two ï¬nal candidate variants located in CPT2 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2) and ADRA1A (Alpha 1A adrenergic receptor) were selected. Conclusions: We identi ï¬ed new potential variants in genes that play a role in cAMP/PKA regulation, which supports their putative involvement in predisposition toritodrine induced pulmonary edema in pregnant women.

Boardman1 1Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States,2Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction: Self rated general health is an important predictor of various aging related adverse health outcomes such as comorbidities, mortality, and healthcare utilization. Telomere length (TL) is a biomarker of accelerated aging. We aimed to assess whether TL is associated with self rated general heath and whether this association differs by genetic predisposition to short TL. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood leukocyte samples from 99 subjects enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Biobank were used to measure TL and three TL associatedSNPs (rs7726159 [TERT]; rs1317082 [TERC], and rs2487999 [OBFC1]). Self rated general health (excellent, very good, good, and fair/poor) was collected using aquestionnaire. Adjusting for age and sex, linear regression models were used to test association of TL with self rated general health and its interaction with the three SNPs. Results: The cohort was relatively young (median age: 45 years) with 65% females and 100% Whites. The median TL was 1.40 (25 th 75thpercentiles: 1.39 1.42). TL decreased with worse self rated health in a dose response manner (e.g., 0.017 shorter TL in poor/fair health vs. excellent health; p ,0.002). The association may be modi ï¬ed by TL associated SNPs (interaction p ,0.001 with rs7726159, and 0.006 with rs287999).Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1683Conclusions: Our pilot study demonstrates that TL is associated with self rated general health, implying that TL may serve as a biomarker for self rated general health.

Over 800 whole exomes were sequenced free of charge in seventeen distinct projects, each focusing on aparticular rare disease and involving PIs from at least two different countries. A requirement of the call was that a specimen from each case be deposited within the Euro BioBank network, to be available to the wider rare disease research community. Phenotypic information for each affected case was collated with PhenoTips using standardssuch as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), OMIM and Orpha codes. Variant ï¬ltration and prioritisation wasundertaken using the RD Connect Genome Phenome Ana lysis Platform (GPAP, https://platform.rd connect.eu ). All samples were processed using the RD Connect stan dard analysis pipeline (Laurie et al, Human Mutation, 2016), and reliable variants uploaded into the GPAP. Analysis and interpretation of cases was undertaken by aclinical genomics specialist and relevant disease domain experts. Advanced GPAP tools such as on the ï¬y gene lists based upon gene HPO relationships, Exomiser, homo zygosity mapping, pathway associations, and matchmaking helped facilitate causative variant identi ï¬cation. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the different pheno types under investigation e.g. neuromuscular disorders, albinism, inborn errors of metabolism, the molecular diag nostic rate was over 33% overall.

Genotypic and phenotypic data is collated, integrated and analysed using the URD Cat platform, based on the RD Connect Genome PhenomeAnalysis Platform. The URD Cat platform integrates previously available and newly generated clinical and genomic data from 1,454 individuals (835 probands). Two hundred and forty eight probands (421 individuals including relatives) for whom genomic data was available in 7 hospitals across Catalonia were reanalysed between 2 8years after initial data generation (mean 4 years). Standar dised phenotypic and clinical information were collected using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and theOrphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO). Genomic data (63 gene panels, 356 whole exomes and 2 whole genomes) were processed with the URD Cat pipeline, includingdetection of Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and runs of homozygosity (RoHs). Clinical and genomic data were shared and reanalysed through the URD Cat platform. Reanalysis of genomic data revealed causative mutations in 9.7% of probands (24/248) and candidate pathogenic variants in 4.4% (11/248). Most new diagnoses were due tonovel gene disease associations (n ,8), technical improve ments in variant calling (n ,3), detection of CNVs (n ,2) and RoHs (n ,1), and URD Cat platform functionalities such as ï¬lter by HPO related genes or pathogenic variant prioritisation (n ,2).

The genetic component of breast cancer risk originates from monogenic variants, as well as polygenic risk. In 2018, Estonian Biobank,University of Tartu, Estonia, together with two central hospitals in Estonia, Tartu University Hospital and North Estonia Medical Center have initiated a pilot study forgenetics based breast cancer screening and follow up management in female participants of the biobank. The study consists of monogenic and polygenic arms. We aim to estimate the possible impact of genetic risk for breast cancer prevention and early detection, as well as to test the subject compliance, psychosocial aspects, data transferlogistics from research to clinical setting, etc. In monogenic arm, cascade screening of relatives will maximise the impact of existing genetic data. The study group consists offemale participates 22 74 years. In monogenic arm, 128 subjects with class 4 and 5 variants in 11 genes recurrently associated with moderate to high risk of breastcancer were identi ï¬ed. The clinical follow up is based on adapted international guidelines. In polygenic arm, the participants with top 5% threshold were selected as high risk group (HR 2.73, 95% CI 1.92 3.9). The females (n ~1300) will receive information about their genetic risk and biennial mammography will be initiated from age 40. We will present the data on study progress and com pliance, as well as discuss the ethical and communication lessons learned, along with perspective on publichealthcare.

Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1685P15.46A Importance of SLC6A4 promoter Short and Long Allelle in predisposition and in determining the optimal drug dosage in patients with majÃ¶r depression C. S. Do Äan1, S. Kapici1, K. Ulucan1, M. Konuk1, N. Tarhan2 1Uskudar University, Faculty Of Engineering And Natural Sciences, Department Molecular Biology And Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey,2Uskudar University, Faculty Of Engineering And Natural Sciences, Department OfPsychology, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Serotonin (5 hydroxytryptamine, 5 HT) is synthesized in serotonergic neurons, from tryptophan. SLC6A4 is the gene that codes for the serotonin transporter (5 HTT), responsible of reuptaking 5 HT. Functionalinsertion / deletion polymorphism found in the gene promoter region (5 HTTLPR) primarily effects 5 HT metabolism; short (S) allele has been reported to beassociated with less transcriptional ef ï¬ciency compared to allele with long (L) allele. Aim of the study is to investigate the distribution of L and S allelles in patients with majordepression. Materials and Methods: 49 patients were enrolled for the study. All patients were informed about the study pro tocol, each patient received written approval prior to the registration. Conventional PCR methodology were carried out for the genotyping of 44 bp S/L allelles. Results: The numbers of the patients and their percen tages were 7 (14%), 26 (53%) and 16 (33%) for the geno types LL, LS and SS, respectively. Allelic count gave rise to40 (41%) and 58 (59%) for L and S allele, respectively. Conclusion: Determining the genotype of patients with depression is important for treatment and also for theappropriate dose of anti depressant SSRIs drugs. In addi tion, the L allele with normal metabolic function compared to the S allele of SLC6A4 is less common in depressedindividuals. Having knowledge about the genotype of SLC6A4 will encourage both individuals and clinicians to have a life style protecting against depression. But studieswith larger cohorts are needed to ful ï¬ll the role of this polymorphism on the onset of depression. C. S. DoÄan:None. S. Kapici: None. K. Ulucan: None. M. Konuk: None. N.

Lyng, Denmark,2Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark,3SDC (Sino Danish Center for Education and Research), Copenhagen,Denmark Introduction: In industrialized countries, testicular cancer (TC) is the most common solid tumor in men between 20 40 years old. Besides being one of the most treatable types of cancer, the long term side effects of chemotherapy, suchas nephrotoxicity, are worrisome, since they are largely irreversible. The standard treatment for TC is 3 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin (BEP). Here, we focuson nephrotoxicity, measured as the drop in glomerular ï¬ltration rate after chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: Clinical patient data on 420 individuals was collected from hospital ï¬les, and saliva samples were used for genotyping using Illumina Â®Huma nOmniExpressExome 8 v1 2 B b37 chip (nearly 1 millionmarkers). Machine learning (ML) models (random forests) includ ing clinical and genomic features were built for classifyingpatients at risk of developing nephrotoxicity given a treat ment of BEP cycles. Results: First, only clinical features, such as age at the time of treatment, dose of cisplatin, patient âs prognosis, and number of cycles, were considered for training the model, and relevant features were selected (based on Gini coef ï¬ cient) to use in the classi ï¬er (AUC 0.66 âsensitivity 0.59, speciï¬city 0.61). The classi ï¬er was then re trained by adding genomic markers. An AUC of 0.75 (sensitivity 0.66,speciï¬city 0.67) was obtained through ML combination clinical and genomic features for nephrotoxicity prediction in patients receiving cisplatin based chemotherapy. Thepresentation will include the top clinical and GWAS SNPs. Conclusions: The study proposes a ML algorithm which, by helping predicting nephrotoxicity in advance, canimprove treatment ef ï¬cacy in TC patients by allowing a more personalized treatment to each patient.

31018,"information is critical to variant interpretation. The QIA GEN knowledgebase includes a manually curated database of variant speci ï¬c publications, and data from public and proprietary databases. This resource is the cornerstone of QIAGEN Clinical Insight (QCI), which facilitates auto mated variant classi ï¬cation using all 28 ACMG rules, while transparently providing the underlying evidence. Here, we compare the concordance of QCI âs automated variant classi ï¬cation with expert panel assessments across multiple disease indications. Materials and Methods: Expert panel (ENIGMA) reviewed BRCA1 andBRCA2 variants (n ,6154), and var iants reviewed by the ClinGen Inherited Cardiomyopathy Expert Panel (n ,102) were exported from ClinVar. Resulting VCFs were uploaded into QCI, and concordance of automated classi ï¬cations was compared with expert panel assessments in ClinVar. Results: With respect to clinical actionability, automated variant classi ï¬cations were extremely concordant, reaching 99.6% concordance with ENIGMA assessments of BRCA variants, and 96.1% concordance with cardiomyopathy variants assessed by the ClinGen expert panel. The small number of differences seen in the ENIGMA dataset couldbe attributed to functional studies used by the automated algorithm not considered by the expert panel. The 3.9% of discrepant classi ï¬cations in the cardiomyopathy set likely result from differences in clinical case curation. Conclusions: Through updated content, and continued alignment with professional guidelines, automated variantclassi ï¬cation in QCI demonstrates extremely high accuracy across multiple disease contexts. This level of accuracy speaks to the quality of the clinical, functional, and popu lation level data curation, as well as the robustness of the underlying ACMG classi ï¬cation algorithm. J. L.

The choice of these tools is critical for reliable variant impact interpreta tion for precision medicine and should be based on systematic performance assessment. The performance of the methods varies widely in different performanceassessments, for example due to the contents and sizes of test datasets. To address this issue, we have collectedbenchmark datasets to VariBench ( http://structure.bmc.lu. se/VariBench/ ) and VariSNP ( http://structure.bmc.lu.se/Va riSNP/ ) and performed performance assessments for disease causing and benign variants, and variants in different regions in membrane proteins. Recently we investigated 63,160 common amino acid substitutions(allele frequency >1% and <25%) in ExAC database to determine the speci ï¬city for 10 variant interpretation tools. In addition to overall speci ï¬city of the tools, we tested their performance for variants in six geographical populations. PON P2 had the best performance followed by FATHMM and VEST. While these tools had excellent performance, the poorest method predicted more than one third of the benign variants to be disease causing. The results allow choosing reliable methods for benign variant interpretation, for bothresearch and clinical purposes, as well as provide a benchmark for method developers. We have developed tools also for the mechanisms of variants including proteinstability, solubility, steric clashes, disorder etc. Financial support: Swedish Research Council References: Niroula, A. and Vihinen, M.

These disorders have deep genomic roots that modulate disease severity, duration, and potential therapeutic outcomes. Our previous work demonstrates that using an in silico functional genomics and evolutionary biology framework can identify functionally relevant enriched genomic hot spots and variants with import for opioid, dopamine andalcohol addiction complex polygenic traits. This study seeks to extend this approach to determine its utility in identifyingAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1687pharmacogenomics therapeutic targets at addiction and mental health hotspots. To evaluate whether the intersection of NCBI curated genes identi ï¬ed as participating in addiction phenotypes along with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression (N ,1968 genes), genes lists were projected onto the human genome to ï¬nd eight areas of addiction and mental health gene set enrichment. Functional annotations were conducted for core phenotype functions. Finally, drug binding annotations were conducted todetermine whether the binding sites sitting in these addiction and mental health hotspots were related to the functional or gene set enrichment. We found that 16pharmacogenomic drug binding sites were identi ï¬ed in this analysis which broadly fell into four categories: cancer, addiction, immunity and mental health related drug effects. The cancer drug target all had addiction, loss of immune robustness, and anxiety as their side effects. These ï¬ndings suggest that this in silico approach can potentially inform drug target effects and may be useful in informing novel and drug repurposing pipelines. L. Jackson: None.",2019

Prior cross sectional studies have investigated the combined effects of age and genetics ongene expression and alternative splicing; however, there has been no long term, longitudinal characterization of these molecular changes, especially in older age. We performedRNA sequencing in whole blood from 65 healthy partici pants from the Prospective Investigation of Uppsala Seniors study at both age 70 and 80, a period of the aging processcharacterized by high morbidity and mortality. We observed that 93% of individuals are more similar to their own expression pro ï¬les later in life than pro ï¬les of other individuals their own age. We identi ï¬ed 1,291 and 294 genes differentially expressed and alternatively spliced withage, as well as 529 genes with outlying individual trajectories. Further, 7.8% and 9.6% of tested genes show a reduction in genetic associations with expression and splicing in older age, with impacted genes enriched in DNA repair pathways. In addition, we observed a high genetic correlation between ages ( Ï G,0.96). In contrast, overall allelic imbalance within an individual increases with age by 2.69%. These ï¬ndings demonstrate that, although the transcriptome and its genetic regulation is mostly stablelate in life, a small subset of genes is dynamic and is characterized by reduction in genetic regulation. The strong correlation of genetic effects and the increase in allelicimbalance with age demonstrates that increasing environ mental variance, as opposed to decreased genetic variance, underlies the reduction in genetic regulation with age.

Most of the web based algorithms, such as Cas Analyzer, focus on the frequency of correction rather than providing a detailedoutcome of the experiment. On the other hand, command line tools usually provide more details, but they are not easily accessible to researchers that are not experts inbioinformatics. In order to combine detailed outcomes with easy to use, we implemented a self contained python module with a graphical user interface for the analysis ofgene editing experiments. CRISPY ï¬rst performs the alignment against the reference genome starting from raw NGS reads, and then it considers all the experimentalsequences overlapping the region of interest, regardless of their lengths, without any sort of ï¬ltering. CRISPY assesses the editing accuracy by determining the amount ofsuccessfully edited sequences in the treated samples with respect to the control experiment, classifying as edited only1688the identical sequences without mutations, therefore indicating the true rate of Homology Directed Repair. It is able not only to evaluate the rate of Non Homologous End Joining, by computing the indel frequency but also to assess the complessive biological ef ï¬cacy counting separately synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions induced inthe range of interest. From a clinical point of view, edited alleles containing unsolicited synonymous substitutions contribute positively to the correction and it may be worthto be identi ï¬ed and counted.

31023,"K. Stecker, M. Hartenfeller, J. Hermanns Molecular Health, Heidelberg, Germany Currently, genetic medicine is increasing in complexity, mainly due to the clinical implementation of next generation sequencing (NGS). Genetic variants can be associated with unknown and/or complex phenotypes. Missense variants regularly tend to be classi ï¬ed as variants of unknown signi ï¬cance (VUS) leading to inconclusive diagnostic ï¬ndings. To meet the challenge of variant classi ï¬cation, we developed two bioinformatic tools: one supporting BRCA1/2 variants classi ï¬cation and one supporting the classi ï¬cation of variants found in Mendelian disorders. The variant interpretation relies on two indepen dent classi ï¬cation methods: Consensus and ACMG classi ï¬cation based on public and proprietary data sources. To pre validate the classi ï¬cation methods, we compared our BRCA tool results with classi ï¬cations provided by three published Japanese hereditary breast and ovarian cancerstudies. The results of the automated, ACMG guided conservative interpretation of BRCA1/2 variants are comparable to the referenced clinical classi ï¬cation of pathogenicity. Of 108 pathogenic variants, BRCA tool classi ï¬ed 80 as pathogenic, 26 as likely pathogenic, and 2 as VUS. Whereas 11/26 benign variants were classi ï¬ed as VUS, a discrepancy due to lack of public population frequency and patient family history data. For the Mende lian tool, we compared the consensus classi ï¬cation with a study, in which 98 germline variants spread over 95 genes with a large phenotypic spectrum were classi ï¬ed. Theconsensus method classi ï¬ed 59/98 as pathogenic and 7/98 as likely pathogenic, a result identical to the reference classi ï¬cation. Variant classi ï¬cations were found to be accurately associated to the corresponding hereditary disease.

When suspected, mtDNA variants identi ï¬cation requires targeted strategies on affected tissues. The expanding use of exome sequencing (ES) in diagnosisgenerates a huge amount of data, including untargeted mtDNA sequences. We thus developed a bioinformatics pipeline on ES data in order to detect mitochondrial variantsin parallel with the routinely used âin house ânuclear exome pipeline, in particular in patients with no initial clinical suspicion of mitochondrial disorders. Methodology: Mitochondrial DNA data coming from off target sequences (indirect sequencing) were extracted from the BAM ï¬les in 928 individuals with developmental (90%) and/or neurological anomalies (10%). After merging, the variants were ï¬ltered out based on database presence, cohort frequencies, haplogroups and protein consequences. In parallel, some patients with previously identi ï¬ed mito chondrial variants were sequenced and tested as positive controls. Results: Two homoplasmic pathogenic variants (m.9035T>C and m.11778G>A) were identi ï¬ed in 2/928 unrelated individuals (0.2%): the m.9035T>C ( MT ATP6 ) variant in a female with ataxia and the m.11778G>A ( MT ND4) variant in a male with a complex mosaic disorder and an unusual severe ophthalmological phenotype, uncoveringundiagnosed Leber âs hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). Seven secondary ï¬ndings were also found, predisposing to deafness or LHON, in 7/928 individuals (0.75%). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the usefulness of including a targeted analysis strategy in ES pipeline to detect mtDNA variants, improving results in diagnosis andresearch, without resampling patients and performing tar geted mtDNA strategies.

As part of this program, the Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC) is charged with empowering col laborative discovery across Kids First datasets. Throughnewly developed platforms and cloud based resources, researchers are able to access standardized genomic and clinical data in a timely fashion. Results: Nearly 30,000 genomic and phenotypic ï¬les generated for over 9,100 individuals from ~1,700 families are available now at DRC portal, making DRC one of thelargest pediatric data resources across a wide range of dis eases.

In this study, we mined phage sequence fromgenomic data of carcinoma patients and longer unmapped NIPT reads of average length 2x100bp. Materials and Methods: We sequenced total DNA from plasma of healthy people. We assessed presence of phage related sequences by different bioinformatic approaches. At ï¬rst, we removed human sequences by mapping to hg38, then we used tools based on k mers identi ï¬cation, contig mapping and gene centric approaches, those utilizing our custom phage database. Same methods were used to analyzeblood samples from patients with solid tumor. Results: We detected the presence of phage related sequences and assessed disparities of aforementioned setsof samples. For instance, we identi ï¬ed sequences belonging to Proteus phage, Escherichia phage PhiX174, Campylo bacter phage B14. Conclusions: NIPT data are like mines, containing unbounded amount of unrevealed informations. Various bioinformatic approaches can be used like mattock to obtainadditional results. Our results demonstrate the detection ofphage sequences in the NIPT data which are usually marked as useless in common NIPT analyses. D. SmoÄ¾ak:None. J. Budi Å¡:A.

Delpu2 1Bionano Genomics, San Diego, CA, United States, 2BioNano Genomics, San Diego, CA, United States Tumors are often comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells, with certain cancer driving mutations at low allele fractions in early stages of cancer development. Effective detection of such variants is critical for diagnosis andtargeted treatment. However, typical short sequence reads are limited in their ability to span across repetitive regions of the genome and to facilitate structural variant (SV)analysis. Based on speci ï¬c labeling and mapping of ultra high molecular weight (UHMW) DNA, we developed a single molecule platform that has the potential to detect disease relevant SVs and give a high resolution view of tumor heterogeneity. We have developed a pipeline that effectively detects structural variants at low allele fractions. It includes single molecule based SV calling and fractional copy number analysis. Preliminary analyses using simulated data andwell characterized cancer samples showed high sensitivity for variants of different types at as low as 5% allele frac tions with reasonable genomic coverage easily collectableon a Bionano Saphyr Chip. The candidate variants are then annotated and further prioritized based on control data and publically available annotations. The data are imported intoa graphical user interface tool that includes new visualiza tion features (such as Circos diagrams) for interactive visualization and curation. The streamlined pipeline is fullycompatible with the new Direct Label and Stain (DLS) chemistry. Together, these components allow for ef ï¬cient analysis of any cancer genome of interest. E. T.

However, success rate is low: many patients do not respond to treatment, whereas others sufferfrom adverse effects. The immune response is mediated by immunological synapse âan interface between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells, which consists of co inhibitory and co stimulatory checkpoint proteins. Understanding interactions within immunological synapse is crucial for better design ofclinical trials and will provide better diagnostics and therapeutics. In our research we aim to improve cancer immu notherapies potential by understanding: 1) the complex regulatory network in immunological synapse that modulates the response;2) how gene expression changes driven by genetic variability translate to alterations in immunological synapse regulatory network. We developed a computational method that infers gene interaction networks from expression pro ï¬les in large cohorts of patients using unsupervised Bayesian machinelearning model. Our method also reduces the dimensionality of data producing factors, that represent differences between cancer sub types and individual patients. In this study we compare regulatory networks in subtypes of kidney carcinomas: clear cell adenocarcinoma, papillary adenocarcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. We found sig niï¬cant differences between subtypes, with some key nodes of network being not expressed, while others being sig niï¬cantly up regulated. These type speci ï¬c alterations of immunological synapse gene network may explain dif ï¬ culties in developing successful checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy in kidney carcinomas.

However, technical limitations are associated with the use of short reads (srGS) in the detection of SV, especially in case of breaking points involving repetitive elements. Hence, long read sequencing (lrGS) represents a promising tool expected to overcome this problem. Method: We deployed 30X srGS and 20X SMRT sequencing (Paci ï¬c Biosciences) to evaluate the utility of lrGS to resolve complex SV in 2 patients with syndromic intellectual disability and carrying respectively more than30 and 70 chromosomal rearrangements (chromotripsis). Results: Using 10 in silico generated datasets containing known SV, were tested a combination of 6 mapping tools(blasr, bwa, nglmr, Lorfast, pbmm2, minimap2) and 3 SV callers (PBhoney, snif ï¬es, pbsv) to identify the out performing pipeline. We then applied our pipeline to the 2chromothripsis and, using SV length and population fre quency information available from publicly data, we ï¬ltered out common variants. Retained breakpoints were indepen dently validated by PCR, Sanger sequencing and/or FISH. Next, we tested 3 assembling tools (Falcon, Canu and wtdbg2) to perform de novo derivative chromosome reconstruction. Using outperforming parameters, we obtained 10238 contigs with a N50 at 13 Kb and a max imum contig length of 11Mb. Conclusions: Overall the combination of srGS and lrGS permitted to resolve, complex chromosomal breakpoints and to reconstruct the phasing of structural variations, nototherwise achievable by srGS alone.

Using gene based collapsing analysis of individualssequenced through the AstraZeneca Medimmune Genomics Initiative, we previously validated known disease genes andidenti ï¬ed new suggestive signals in speci ï¬c genes. How ever, risk to complex disorders may also be driven by multiple hits in a common pathway, or the scenario where many genes can cause the same disease thereby making it difï¬cult to signi ï¬cantly detect individual genes in currently available cohort sizes. We present here the application of âmega gene âas a new analytical approach to identify biologically relevant gene sets involved in disease. We achieve this by comparing thecase and control rates of genes in a given gene set that carry rare and deleterious predicted variants. The tested gene sets include 10,161 from published databases such as KEGG,Reactome, Gene Ontology and others. Applying the novel approach to a cohort of individuals who were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and recruited into an Astra Zeneca clinical trial, we ï¬nd several gene sets achieving a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p value < 0.01.

We previously demonstrated an enrichment of circRNAs at MS genome wide associated loci as well as a genotype dependent regulation of a circRNA derived from the MS associated STAT3 gene. Here, we aimed at exploring the global pro ï¬le of circRNA expression in MS patients and evaluating a possible correlation with their genetic background. Materials and Methods: We performed RNA seq experiments on RNAse R treated RNAs, extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 10 MS patients and 10 matched healthy controls. The same patients/controlswere genotyped using the In ï¬nium HumanCore 24 v1.1 BeadChip. An expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)analysis, aimed at correlating the genotypes of MS associated variants with the expression levels of cir cRNAs, was performed using the FastQTL tool. Results: We detected 5,663 circRNAs, uniformly dis tributed on all chromosomes. The expression analysis revealed 166 differentially expressed circRNAs in MSpatients (P<0.05), 125 of which are downregulated. Nota bly, the dysregulation of one of the top hits has already been conï¬rmed in an independent case control cohort. Moreover, the eQTL analysis evidenced a signi ï¬cant association between 58 MS loci and the expression of at least one circRNA.

We present here an ef ï¬cient bioinformatic pipeline for CNV detection from targeted NGS data. This will increase the diagnostic yield in a cost effective way in clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders, such as neuromuscular disorders. Materials and Methods: We chose four programs, CoNIFER, XHMM, ExomeDepth and CODEX, since theyhave complementary CNV detection ranges in sensitivity, speciï¬city, and variant size and state. Heterozygous dele tions and duplications were generated in silico into samples sequenced with a gene panel of approximately 350 genesfor neuromuscular disorders. A logarithmic regression model was trained for predicting true positive CNVs among variant detections from these samples. This model was validated with negative (N ,30) and positive (N ,52) con trol samples with real CNVs. Results: CNV features, such as state or size, did not markedly affect the model performance. Therefore, the simpli ï¬ed model examines only program scores for detec tions. Model with detections from all four programs pro vided more accurate CNV detection results for the control samples than any other program combination or program alone. Conclusions: No single analysis program can capture all CNV sizes and types with equal accuracy. Therefore, a combination of programs should be used to maximizesensitivity and speci ï¬city.

DECIPHER displays both the nuclear and mitochondrialgenomes, and all scales of genomic variation, from single base to megabases, in a single interface. DECIPHER âs mission is to map the clinically relevant elements of thegenome and understand their contribution to human development and disease. DECIPHER stores both phenotype and genotype data. Currently there are more than 37,000 variants (sequence and copy number) and more than 89,000 phenotypes (HPO terms) that are shared openly on the website. The wealth ofthese data in DECIPHER allows the aggregation of data1696associated with pathogenic variants in disease genes. To aid diagnosis aggregated phenotype data is used to identify the most discriminating phenotypes associated with disease genes. Quantitative phenotype data, such as anthropometric measurements and developmental milestones, are aggre gated and visual/statistical tools are used to allow thecomparison of a patient with other patients harboring pathogenic variants in the same gene. Aggregating data in DECIPHER is extremely powerful in aiding diagnosis anddiscovery whilst harmonized with DECIPHER âs propor tionate data sharing approach.

31040,"1Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom,2Open Targets, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom The discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals is a time consuming and expensive process. A major challenge is high attrition, as a large proportion of drugs are found tobe ineffective at clinical trial. However, drugs that have genome wide association study (GWAS) evidence support ing a link between its target and indication are twice aslikely to be approved for clinical use. Here we present Open Targets Genetics, an open science resource which makes robust connections between disease associated loci andlikely causal genes, to enable the identi ï¬cation and prioritisation of new drug targets. We combine GWAS associations curated from literature and the recently released NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog summary statistics database (including over 3,000 UK Biobank phenotypes) to locate over 100,000 disease associated loci. We then use statistical ï¬ne mapping (or linkage disequilibrium expansion if no summary statistics are available) to identify a set of potentially causal variantsat each locus. Lastly, variants are integrated with functional genomics data (e.g. promoter capture Hi C, DNase hyper sensitivity sites), molecular quantitative trait loci (e.g.eQTLs, pQTLs) and in silico functional predictions to link each variant to its target gene(s) using a uni ï¬ed evidence score. Most recently, we have added systematic disease molecular trait colocalisation analysis using the upcoming Open Targets European Bioinformatics Institute eQTL database.

Colombo2 1Thermo Fisher Scienti ï¬c, South San Francisco, CA, United States,2Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano, Milan, Italy Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed associations between genotype, phenotype and pathologies. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been mapped in many tumor types, such as breast, lung and prostate cancer. These studies measured genome wide geneexpression in tumors and identi ï¬ed associations between these gene expression levels and commonly inherited genetic variants pro ï¬led in the same patients. Since the majority of inherited cancer risk variants as identi ï¬ed by GWAS are in non coding regions, eQTL analysis of cancer tissues is becoming extremely important. In this study wedemonstrate a streamlined work ï¬ow to study eQTLs in lung adenocarcinoma. Previous GWAS have identi ï¬ed several lung cancer susceptibility loci, however functionality ofmost of these loci remains unexplained. Here we focused on SNPs previously reported to be associated with lung cancer in different populations. We studied the association ofcandidate SNPs with lung adenocarcinoma risk and overall survival in a cohort of 96 patients and healthy controls using the Axiom genotyping arrays and Clariom D geneexpression arrays. The function of these SNPs was assessed as eQTLs, these results suggest that the candidate SNPs exert their effects on cancer risk/outcome through themodulation of mRNA levels of their target genes.

However,most GWAS variants fall in non transcribed regions, and even exon focused catalogs such as ClinVar contain thousands of variants that do not overlap known transcripts. Here, we present efforts by GENCODE to improve the scope and usability of our human gene annotation in a disease related context, along multiple lines. Firstly, ourpublic geneset is about to undergo a massive expansion, as tens of thousands of new transcript models are incorporated based on long read sequencing datasets. This work willcause thousands of variants to be reclassi ï¬ed as transcribed. However, even when variant transcription is established, uncertainties regarding âfunctional categorization â espe cially coding potential can still undermine attempts to prioritize variants or judge pathogenicity. This expansion is therefore being carried out alongside efforts to reappraisethe CDS content of our geneset, incorporating evolutionary conservation, population genetics datasets and proteoge nomics methods. Pertinently, our creation of the ï¬rst whole genome PhyloCSF dataset allowed us to add over 230kb of novel high quality CDS annotation, leading to the reclassi ï¬cation of 118 GWAS variants from non coding to protein disrupting. Furthermore, we are now utilizing a fully integrated manual work ï¬ow to develop our novel annota tions in a clinical context. For example, our targetedreannotation of 191 genes linked to epilepsy led to the identi ï¬cation of 3 novel de novo SCN1A coding mutations within a panel of 122 patients with Dravet âs syndrome.

MGI integrates mouse genotype phenotype datasets from biomedical literature and large scale projects with genomic, mutation, expression, functional and human disease model data to inform disease etiology and therapeutic design. Recent enhancementsinclude newly established anatomical mappings between the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) and Mouse Developmen tal Anatomy (EMAPA) ontologies and a user interface, co deployed with the Gene Expression Database (GXD), which enables comparison of gene expression and phenotype annotations for mouse genes. The new Gene Expression + Phenotype Comparison Matrix, accessible from MGI âs Gene Detail page, visually juxtaposes tissues where a gene is normally expressed against tissues where mutations inthat gene cause phenotype abnormalities. The anatomy axis of the matrix can be expanded and collapsed, allowing users to interactively explore correlations between gene expres sion and phenotype data at different levels of spatial resolution. An enhanced Mouse Developmental Anatomy Browser provides quick access to phenotype annotations inaddition to expression data associated with a given anatomical structure or substructures. The updated MP Browser links to mapped anatomical structures, enablingaccess to wild type expression data in tissues associated with a given phenotype. Moreover, MGI âs Allele Detail page features a link to affected anatomical structures,facilitating retrieval of wild type expression data in tissues afï¬icted by the underlying mutation.

In this respect, delineating the constituent biological components that play part will bring a greaterAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1699understanding of the processes in action. We will present an integrative computational approach of linking gene expression to phenotypes and biological pathways in Drosophila and extend the methodology in individuals with AD. We base our approach on the concept that a broad phenotype, such as AD, is composed of simpler inter mediate subphenotypes. Methods: By combining gene expression data from single gene mutants in Drosophila that exhibit a particular subphenotype (biological replicates of this phenotype), genes/biological pathways that play a role in the sub phenotype will be enriched. The goal is to enhance thesignal from genes that play a role in a subphenotype and reduce the noise. Linear mixed effect model will be used to circumvent the inter experiment variability and to combinethe gene expression data and generate molecular signatures from different experiments and accounting for differences that are not of interest. Results: We will present preliminary, proof of concept results for several complex subphenotypes in Drosophila . We will also show how these molecular signatures can beused to describe the studied subphenotypes. Conclusions: Our methodology has the ability to not only assert the relationship of AD with already known sub phenotypes, but can also discover not yet tested sub phenotypes and associated biological pathways. This methodology has also a potential to quantify the relation ship between different subphenotypes and AD animal models. Funding: ERDF through the Welsh GovernmentD. Ivanov: None. M. Hill: None. N.

Genome editing provides wide opportunities for modeling and treating CF. The aim of this work was editingof F508del mutation in CFTE29o cells using CRISPR/ Cas9. Materials and Methods: The work was performed in CFTE29o cell immortalized cell line of tracheal epithe lium from a patient with CF (F508del/F508del). Three nucleases (eSpCas9(1.1), SpCas9(HF4), SaCas9) in com bination with four sgRNAs were used. Two sgRNAs were targeted speci ï¬cally to F508del (sgCFTR#1, sa_sgCFTR#3); the other two were to downstream region(sgCFTR#2, sgCFTR#3). In addition, we used a plasmid with an insert of CFTR fragment with F508del to study potential in ï¬uence of the genomic context on the editing efï¬ciency. Four single stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) were designed to repair double strand DNA breaks. Cas9 +sgRNA plasmids were co transfected with model plasmid and ssODN into CFTE29o cells by lipo fection. The editing ef ï¬cacy was evaluated by TIDE and TIDER methods. Results and Conclusions: Indel formation ef ï¬cacy was 2.1 7.5% in the plasmid (the highest ef ï¬cacy with Cas9 (HF4)/sgCFTR#1) and 1.4 7.9% in the genomic locus (thehighest ef ï¬cacy with Cas9(1.1)/sgCFTR#3). Then we co transfected cells with the most effective combination Cas9 (1.1)/sgCFTR#3 together with ssODN, homologous repair(CTT insertion) in genomic locus was 8.7%. This level of efï¬ciency makes reasonable development of treatment of CF by genome editing. Additional studies are necessary toconï¬rm these results and increase ef ï¬cacy.

Yet, 50 70% of these patients remain unexplained at the molecular level, arguing the interest to extend the genetic investigations beyond protein coding regions and tointegrate multi omics approaches. Method: We launched a multi centric study gathering 30 unsolved patients, after trio ES and array CGH analyses,presenting with heterogeneous mild to severe syndromic intellectual disabilities. We performed trio genome sequencing (GS) combined with linked read sequencing(10X Genomics) and blood derived transcriptome analysis. Results: We present our results on the ï¬rst third of the cohort. GS analysis identi ï¬ed 3 de novo pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in PURA, FOXG1, CYFIP2 and KMT2D , as well as an inherited hemizygous FGD1 variant. Theï¬rst two variants had not been captured by the exome kit, while CYFIP2 was not yet a morbid gene at the time of the ES analysis. The remaining ones, had not been identi ï¬ed by the molecular diagnostic laboratory responsible for the ES analysis. GS highlighted the presence of a de novo 2M b inversion located 400 Kb upstream MEF2C (conï¬rmed by linked read analysis), responsible for the disruption of the Topologically Associating Domain regulating this gene, and a9K b de novo complex structural variant, causing the heterozygous loss of 3 exons of CASK resulting in a fra meshift mutation (RNA seq data). Conslusions: Our preliminary results on 10 patients show that a multi omics approach allowed the identi ï¬cation of 4 additional molecular diagnoses not otherwise achievable with ES. Y.

RefSeq (NCBI)and Ensembl/GENCODE (led by EMBL EBI) produce independent human gene annotation. Since 2005, the joint Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) project has de ï¬ned over 30,000 CDS for 95% of coding genes. However, the large number of alternatively spliced transcripts and the lack of standardized default transcripts displayed acrossresources present challenges, especially in the clinical context. Building on our past collaboration, we haveAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1701launched a new initiative, the Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL EBI (MANE) project, to jointly converge on a high con ï¬dence, genome wide transcript set. During phase 1, we will release the MANE Select tran script set to include one well supported transcript per protein coding locus. All transcripts in the set will perfectlyalign to the GRCh38 reference assembly and represent 100% identity (5 âUTR, CDS, 3 âUTR) between the Ensembl (ENST) transcript and the corresponding RefSeq (NM)transcript. MANE Select transcripts are identi ï¬ed using independent computational methods complemented by manual review and discussion. The methods utilize evi dence of functional potential such as expression levels, evolutionary conservation, and clinical signi ï¬cance. Tran script ends are de ï¬ned using CAGE data from the FAN TOM consortium and polyA site data from conventional and next generation sequencing. Currently, we have de ï¬ned MANE Select transcripts for 53% of human coding genesand are working towards genome wide coverage.

To ensure SS are consistent across studies and interoperable they are pre processed and made available in a standard format. They are also harmonised, with respect to genome build and strand. Each SS dataset is linked to the curated data and metadata from the publication. Older GWASCatalog studies are re curated, where required, to ensure the study structure is correctly represented. Access to SS is provided from the GWAS Catalog FTP site ( www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/downloads/summary statistics ), via API from a SS datastore ( www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/summa ry statistics/docs/ ) and via links within our redesigned query interface ( www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/search ). The query interface also provides improved search and display functionality for all Catalog data. New pages provide access to structuredinformation and visualisations that were previously una vailable, while a new API provides programmatic access to curated Catalog data ( www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/api ). We are working to increase the number of available SS, encouraging authors to submit their SS and campaigning for data sharing. To ensure SS are accessible, usable, updatedand relevant to the user community we are engaging with the community to develop standards for data reporting.

We have developeda pipeline and user interface for single cell analysis named HiVA ( https://hiva.esat.kuleuven.be ). HiVA (Haplarithm inference of Variant Alleles) is an interactive web platformfor genome haplarithmisis of DNA samples derived from a large number of cells down to a single cell. HiVA automatically reconstructs parental haplarithms (i.e. hapla rithm pro ï¬les indicating both haplotypes and copy number states) and provides a user friendly interface for scrutinizing allelic imbalances across the genome. We are showing thatHiVA enables concurrent haplotyping and copy number proï¬ling of single cells. In contrast to conventional family based haplotyping methods that make use of discrete bi allelic SNP genotypes (AA, AB and BB) to reconstruct haplotypes, haplarithmisis uses continuous SNP genotypes values, which potentially harbor quantitative (haplotype) and qualitative (copy number) assessment of genomes. HiVA is a novel sequencing based approach for whole genome SNP typing of single cells, and determine genome wide haplotypes, the copy number of those haplotypes as well as the parental and segregational origin of chromoso mal aberrations from sequencing and array based SNP landscapes of single cells.

Because of its non speciï¬c signs, HAE is poorly recognized in the clinical ï¬eld, resulting in delayed diagnoses that increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. To adapt its diagnosis to next generation sequencing (NGS) based assessments, we devel oped Hereditary Angioedema Database Annotation (HADA) tool.

The information was used to establish a database con ï¬gured for ANNOVAR to be seamlessly incorporated into the routine NGS bioinfor matics annotation. Results: Currently, HADA includes records for 416 sim ple causal variants in the ï¬ve genes underlying HAE. However, 25% of those were classi ï¬ed as non pathogenic by current guidelines, suggestive of a gap in the inter pretation of disease variants and a necessity to improve the classi ï¬ers of pathogenicity potential of genetic variants. Conclusions: To adapt the genetic diagnosis of HAE to the era of NGS based genomic medicine, we have devel oped HADA as a freely available tool simplifying the identi ï¬cation of point mutations and short indels causing HAE.

HLA calling from whole genome sequencing data (WGS) remains to be challenging due to the incompleteness of population speci ï¬c references. We have previously described the construction of Japanese reference sequences that fully covers the gene body region of HLA class I (Japanese HLA sequences). This study aims to evaluate theaccuracy of HLA calling from WGS when the Japanese HLA sequences were combined with the IPD IMGTreference sequences to estimate the most likely HLA genotypes. Materials and Methods: To assess the usefulness of population speci ï¬c HLA references in HLA calling, we have compared the performance of different sets of refer ences (with and without Japanese HLA sequences) acrossHLA A, HLA B and HLA C alleles by using HLA VBSeq, aï¬exible software which allows the use of arbitrary refer ence sequences. Results: We evaluated their performances by using 418 Japanese samples as testing data, in which HLA genotypes were determined with Luminex technology. All of the testswere implemented based on 4 digit resolution. As a result, the performance of HLA calling in the Japanese population signiï¬cantly increased with custom HLA panel Conclusions: We suggest that including the sequences obtained from regional population samples is an effective way to improve the accuracy of HLA calling from WGSdataset.

Among them, inversions are genomic regions that change orientation without gain orloss of DNA and many of them have highly identical inverted repeats (IRs) at the breakpoints. Moreover, they tend to be recurrent and not linked to SNPs. Thus, thecomplexity of such regions has made inversion character ization dif ï¬cult. Previously, we developed a combination of inverse PCR and MLPA to simultaneously interrogate 24common human inversions mediated by IRs in hundreds of individuals. Here, we have optimized this method by taking advantage of the iPLEX technology to detect one singlenucleotide change speci ï¬c of each orientation using mass spectrometry and extending the analysis to additional1704inversions. Also, we have improved genotype accuracy by designing speci ï¬c assays that take into account common polymorphisms affecting restriction enzyme target sites. Currently, we are able to genotype 37 inversions ampli ï¬ed in four different PCR reactions from as little as 400 ng of DNA. In order to test the performance of the method, wehave genotyped 95 individuals from three populations of the 1000 Genomes Project with 94.3% genotyping rate and an error rate of ~3% for a single experiment. The newgenotype data generated allow us to have a ï¬rst glimpse on the functional and evolutionary consequences of these inversions. In addition, having a high throughput genotyp ing technique paves the way to unravel the role of inversions in complex traits and disease susceptibilities. M. Laplana: None. S. Villatoro: None. R.

Its ontological PPI integration using RHCP as a standar dized reference node set constitutes PICKLE the only PPImeta database enabling the evaluation of the human interactome expansion at both the protein and gene levels through comparison of its successive releases; this evalua tion is the objective of this study. Methods: The default ( âcross checked â) Uniprot level interactomes of PICKLE 2.1 2.3, integrating data from 02/2015 to 11/2018, respectively, were compared. Default net works exclude PPIs of low experimental con ï¬dence of being direct. Network analysis was performed using Cytoscape. Results: The current human experimentally determined direct PPI network, as reconstructed by PICKLE, comprises 178306 PPIs between 15823 UniProt IDs, twice more thanthe largest primary datasets, emphasizing thus the need for source database integration for reliable human interactomereconstruction. The increase in newly added proteins is one third than that in newly determined PPIs, most of the latter enriching the interactions of existing proteins, while, as predicted in PICKLE 1.0, most newly added proteins have 1 4 interactions. The interactome becomes denser, however, its expansion over the 15% of RHCP with no known PPIsmay require targeted experiments. Conclusions: The study supports our previous statement that the human protein interactome structure with respect toits hubs has been largely de ï¬ned. Elucidating its dynamics is the next challenge for network medicine. Supported by: ELIXIR GR(MIS_5002780)/ ÎÎÎ¤ÎÎ ÎÎ (MIS_5002469)/EATRIS GR(MIS_5028091)/INSPIRED (MIS_5002550). G. N.

Network based bioinformatics approaches are used to highlight the genes that participate in the co expression network differentiation between pre symptomatic and HDstatus. Materials and Methods: A microarray dataset âHuman blood expression for Huntington âs disease versus control â (GSE1751), was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. Differential expression and gene co expression analysis took place with Limma, Parmigene and igraph packages. DyNet, a Cytoscape plugin, was used to visualize the most rewired nodes and edges in pairwise network comparisons, namely control vs HD and control vs pre symptomatic HDgene co expression networks. The highlighted genes through DyNet were further analysed through Pathway Connector, a post pathway analysis tool developed by ourgroup, that provides clusters of connected pathways related to the input genes. Results: From the top network based differentiated genes we kept the ones that correspond to each network and we performed PathwayConnector analysis. Among the com mon pathways between HD and pre symptomatic, wehighlight the dopaminergic synapse pathway. Furthermore,Abstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1705there are 12 pathways found exclusively in the pre symptomatic group and 6 in the HD group. Conclusion: The genes and pathways obtained through the presented network based approach may be further investigated to understand which genes and proteins are most important in each stage providing insight regarding thecorresponding implicated mechanisms.

Long read sequencing (LRS) techniques mayresolve this problem by enabling more sensitive detection of structural variants (SVs) and variation in low complexity regions. In order to con ï¬rm the potential increased sensitivity of LRS, we selected 5 patients with intellectual disability and their healthy parents and performed trio LRS using the Paci ï¬c Biosciences Sequel instrument. These samples had been previously analyzed extensively with CNV microarrays, exome sequencing and by whole genome SRS, but no disease causing variant was found. All samples were sequenced to at least 15x coverage, and a single trio was sequenced to more than 40x coverage. We found that more than 20Mb of the genome was coveredonly by LRS and not by SRS, of which 600kb within coding regions. Per individual genome we identi ï¬ed up to 22,000 SVs >50bp and >40,000 indels of 20 50bp. Mendelian inheritance concordance was as high as 87 95% within trios. Per trio we identi ï¬ed only 3 32 candidate de novo SVs. Additionally, we performed single nucleotidevariant (SNV) calling, giving rise to 3 4 million SNVs per individual, with approximately 24,000 in the exome. Mendelian inheritance concordance for SNVs was as highas 97%. Taken together this shows that current LRS performs better for identifying SVs and variation in low complexity regions, whereas results for SNVs are close tothose for SRS. These results highlight the potential of LRS to replace SRS for clinical purposes in the future.1706C. Gilissen: None. A. M. Wenger: A.

Genes located on the Y chromosome, both in the male speci ï¬c region (MSY) and in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), are involved inimportant processes such as transcription, translation, chromatin remodeling, ribosome assembly, transcription factor binding and post translational modi ï¬cations. LOY therefore has the potential to cause genome wide dysregula tion of gene expression in affected cells. Here we present results from transcriptome sequencing of freshly collectedperipheral blood cells using two different technologies, i.e. scRNA seq and bulk RNA seq, the latter performed on selected immune cell fractions sorted using ï¬uorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The results shows that: 1) LOY can be measured from RNA and that results are comparable with DNA based measurements, 2) that theexpression of genes located in the MSY and PAR regions of chromosome Y follows predictable patterns with lower expression as a consequence of LOY, and 3) that LOYAssociated Transcriptional Effect (LATE) can also be identi ï¬ed in autosomal genes. The results indicate thatLOY in immune cells cause dysregulation of gene expression with important functional consequences for affected cells and individuals. Together with previous ï¬ndings that men with LOY in blood cells have a greater risk for mortality and disease, these new results helps explain why men live shorter lives compared to females.

The method of choice for LOY estimation is SNP array, because the generated data originally intended for GWAS is now used to for LOY studies. However onebig drawback with SNP array is the data unit (log R Ratio), making it dif ï¬cult to interpret and compare with LOY measurements using other methods. Here I present a new method to transform SNP array data into percentage of LOY cells. This method was derived from LOY measurements from 121 men at 93 years of age,using three different methods i.e. SNP array, whole genome sequencing and droplet digital PCR targeting AMELY and AMELX . This standardization was applied to samples from a unique cohort consisting of LOY measurements from 276 men, sampled at different time points over a period of up to 22.2 years. Most of the individuals had an increase inmeasured LOY over time but complex LOY dynamics could also be seen, likely due to aberrant clonal expansions.

Being on a gluten containing diet is necessary for a correct diagnosis. We hypothesize that merging different levels of genomicinformation through Mendelian Randomization (MR) can help discover genetic biomarkers useful in the diagnosis of different conditions such as CeD. Methods: We apply a MR based approach confronting results from the largest to date genome wide association study (GWAS) on CeD and from expression and methyla tion quantitative trait loci(QTL) databases. Particularly, we search for the overlapping hits of the different MR analyses performed and interrogate the prioritized genes in inde pendent expression databases to test their diagnostic potential. Results: We identify UBE2L3 , an ubiquitin ligase located in a CeD associated region whose expression is altered in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CeD patients on gluten free diet (GFD). The relative expression of UBE2L3 isoforms predicts CeD with 100% speci ï¬city and sensitivity and thus could be used as a diagnostic marker, especially in the absence of gluten consumption. Conclusions: The clinical interest of this ï¬nding is in line with the rising frequency of both self reported wheat sen sitivity and auto imposed GFD, a phenomenon that is hin dering the diagnosis of CeD. Additionally, our strategy could be applicable to other disorders in which diagnosis in the absence of the disease provoking insult is challenging,and is a good demonstration of the translation of the resultsof MR to the routine clinical practice.

Since gene methylation can capture the long term effects on gene regulation, its role as a determinant or target of gut microbial composition is of special interest. Byintegrating the population based data from the LifeLines Deep cohort, we investigated the relations between gene methylation in blood and gut microbiota abundances. Themicrobiome data were generated by 16S (V4 region) sequencing of the DNA isolated from stool samples, and processed according to the MiBioGen pipeline available athttps://github.com/alexa kur/miQTL_cookbook . 271 taxa present in at least 10% of the individuals were selected.

For each taxa we performed an epigenome wide association study correcting for environmental, intrinsic and hostgenetic factors in the complete set of 702 individuals. Although no CpG taxa pair reached experiment wide signiï¬cance calculated as false discovery rate, 49 pairs with P value < 2.4 Ã 10 7passed the signi ï¬cance threshold set for a single test.

However, the vast size of the regulome, great number of variants, and dif ï¬culty in predicting their phenotypic impact make searching patho genic variants in the regulatory genome challenging. New tools for identi ï¬cation of regulatory variants based on their relevance to the phenotype are needed. Methods: We used tissue speci ï¬c regulatory locimapped by ENCODE and FANTOM5, together with microRNA gene interactions from miRTarBase and miRWalk, to develop Remus a system for identi ï¬cation of tissue speciï¬c regulatory regions ( https://github.com/seru71/ remus ). Remus combines regulatory features linked to known disease associated genes, and ï¬lters them using activity status in target tissues. For user convenience,Remus provides a web interface and facilitates in browser ï¬ltering of variant ï¬les, making it suitable for sensitive data. Results: To evaluate our approach, we used a set of distal regulatory mutations reported causative for 23 distinct monogenic disorders, and a manually curated list of tissues affected by these disorders. Out of 23 mutated loci (enhancers and promoters) located 100bp 120,000bp away from the regulated genes, Remus correctly identi ï¬ed 19.

DNA microarrays still dominate in CNV detection, however next generation sequencing (NGS) is slowly taking over using coverage based tools. In this study, wedeveloped a comprehensive in house bioinformatic pipeline that integrates CNV and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis from various NGS platforms and provides exten sive annotation for routine use in research and diagnostics. Methods: GATK4 tools were used to process bam ï¬les and data denoising. Allele frequency (AF) data wasobtained from gnomAD.

Results: Using the pipeline, we observed effective noise reduction even in bam ï¬les previously tested by other tools and displaying GC wave.

For consanguineous patients without a geneticdiagnosis, the identi ï¬cation of regions of homozygosity can assist with both diagnosis and gene discovery. This is usually obtained using a microarray, or it can be calculatedfrom genome sequencing data. We aimed to develop a novel method to utilise the off target reads from existing targeted NGS panel data toidentify regions of homozygosity genome wide. We developed SavvyHomozygosity, which uses off target reads from targeted NGS data in combination withlinkage disequilibrium to calculate regions of homo zygosity. We used data from 170 samples sequenced using both targeted NGS (average 3.4M reads per sample) andgenome sequencing (mean read depth 35) to estimate the sensitivity and speci ï¬city of the method. Regions of homozygosity larger than 3Mb were detected with sensitivity and speci ï¬city of 77%, and 10Mb with sensitivity and speci ï¬city of 93%. Detection was not limited to regions of the genome that are targeted by thesequencing panel. SavvyHomozygosity identi ï¬es regions of homozygosity genome wide in samples sequenced using a targeted NGSpanel. The resulting data can be used to assist the discovery of causative variants, and can also be used with manysamples to identify âhot spots âin the genome that may pinpoint an as yet undiscovered disease gene.

We previously published RNAseq from human olfactoryepithelium, a rarely studied tissue, and obtained a whole transcriptome overview. The results were incorporated into a study of 8 Israeli families with congenital general anosmia(CGA). Identi ï¬ed mutations in olfactory developmental genes suggest that the de ï¬cit results from abnormal embryonic development of the olfactory neuronal pathway. In parallel, we study the evolution of the olfactory receptor genes (ORs), GPCRs with a crucial role in odor detection. The ORs undergo many species speci ï¬c dupli cations/deletions, resulting in complex orthology relation ships. While for human a widely accepted nomenclature is available, based on phylogenetic classi ï¬cation into 18 families and further into subfamilies, for other mammals different nomenclature systems are used, concealing important evolutionary insights. We developed a systematicclassi ï¬er for assigning a uni ï¬ed human based nomenclature to any OR gene based on inter species hierarchical pairwise similarities, and applied it to the OR repertoires of 7mammals and zebra ï¬sh (10,247 ORs). This nomenclature generates a framework for evolutionary studies, where textual symbol comparison allows an immediate identi ï¬ cation of potential orthologs and species speci ï¬c expan sions/deletions, e.g. Or52e5 and Or52e5b represent a duplication of OR52E5 in rat. Another example is the absence of OR6Z subfamily among primate OR symbols. In other mammals, OR6Z members are disposed in one genomic cluster, suggesting a large deletion in the primatelineage.1710This uni ï¬ed nomenclature is applied by the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee and its implementation is under consideration by relevant species speci ï¬c nomen clature committees.

Defects in CD mightlead to forms of orofacial clefting, such as nonsyndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P). Despite recent success by GWAS, the biological interpretation has largelybeen hampered by the lack of relevant tissue and the location of risk loci within non coding regions. Here, we generated a new multi ethnic meta analysis on nsCL/P bycombining three recent nsCL/P GWAS. Subsequently, these data were systematically integrated with epigenetic data from human neural crest cells (NCC) and embryonic facialtissue (eFT), covering the entire period of CD. In our meta analysis, ï¬ve novel risk loci were identi ï¬ed, increasing the number of nsCL/P risk loci to 45. For about 50%, availabledata on histone modi ï¬cations and chromatin accessibility revealed distinct epigenetic activity patterns in NCC and eFT. The Combination with interaction data revealed novelcandidate genes with yet unknown roles in CD. For instance, at the 1p22 locus, we con ï¬rm the presence of active enhancers within ABCA4 that regulate ARHGAP29 expression. However, our data also suggest that another gene, ABCD3 , becomes activated at later stages of CD. This ï¬rst systematic integration of functional data from relevant embryonic cell types provides new insights into the etiology of nsCL/P and the biological impact of associated variants. Our data indicate that different genes become activated and repressed in a time and tissue speci ï¬c manner, which implies that the âone locus one candidate gene âtheory might be too simplistic, at least for nsCL/P.

A promising complemen tary avenue is to identify causes of rare diseases as aberrant regulatory events (RNA level or splicing) in RNAsequencing data. However, existing methods for detecting aberrant regulatory events in RNA seq data either lack assessments of statistical signi ï¬cance or rely on subjective manual corrections for confounders. Here, we address these issues by using denoising autoencoders as generic tool to detect outliers while automatically controlling for co variation resulting from technical, environmental, or common genetic variations. Our model to detect expression outliers, implemented in the Bioconductor package OUT RIDER, uses the negative binomial distribution to model RNA seq read counts. OUTRIDER improves upon state of the art expression outlier methods for detecting simulatedoutliers, genes with rare variants possibly causing non sense mediated decay in the GTEx dataset, and pathogenic rare expression events in a rare disease cohort. We will alsopresent unpublished results on splicing outlier detection based on the beta binomial distribution. We use an annotation free approach to detect novel splice sites, andconsider both exon exon junction reads and reads over lapping exon intron boundaries to detect intron retention events.

Low frequencymutations present in a tissue have been shown to exist in other tissues, even of different germ layer origin. Conse quently, de ï¬ning tissue speci ï¬c variants is an inef ï¬cient strategy for detecting these mutations, which increases the need to identify the confounding factors hampering the discrimination of true somatic variants from noise. As acase study, we assessed the detection of somatic mutations in sporadic Parkinson âs disease (PD). Methods: We sequenced the whole exomes of substantia nigra, striatum, neocortex, cerebellum and peripheral blood from 10 PD patients. Con ï¬dence of detected variants was assessed by comparative analyses. Results: Inter tissue and inter individual comparisons showed high variability of variant allele frequency (VAF) even for high con ï¬dence heterozygous variants (21.1% of calls with a VAF <0.4 or >0.6). Moreover, we found that on target calls VAFs are signi ï¬cantly shifted towards the reference allele, demonstrating a probe bias in exomesequencing data relevant for this application. Remarkably, we also observed that alignment artifacts derived from unresolved regions still emerge even after removing geno mic regions dif ï¬cult to align, such as low mappability regions or segmental duplications. Based on theseobservations, we propose a series of guidelines to call somatic mutations and describe a set of high con ï¬dence calls from 10 PD patients. Conclusions: The use of multiple tissues or replicates as well as awareness of the error sources are of great impor tance to call somatic mutations. I. Lobon: None. D. Juan: None. J. Ãvila: None. T.

Gut microbiome composition might contribute to PCOS sus ceptibility. We pro ï¬led the microbiome in DNA isolated from faecal samples by 16S rRNA sequencing of 19/20 Kashmiri (India) women with/without PCOS.

Therefore, the PCs have often been used for adjusting genome wide association analyses for population strati ï¬ca tion. It can be assumed that this is particularly relevant in a genetically heterogeneous population. Large scale popula tion based biobanks have increased the potential to studythe impact of ï¬ne scale strati ï¬cation and cryptic relatedness also in small and homogeneous populations. Methods: We analysed 49,363 participants from the EGCUT cohort genotyped using various Illumina arrays. The individuals are sampled from all counties of Estonia. We calculated the ï¬rst 250 PCs using 61,044 independent variants. Results: As most of the ï¬rst 250 PCs were signi ï¬cantly associated with the county of birth, we show that it is mostefï¬cient to use all of them in the k means algorithm. Next, we tested the association of cluster membership, actual county of birth as well as the individual PCs with prevalentcoronary heart disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and polygenic risk scores (GRS) for the same diseases. Three ï¬rst PCs as well as county of birth were signi ï¬cantly associated with prevalent CAD status, but not with T2D. The GRS for T2D was signi ï¬cantly associated with the ï¬rsteleven PCs and the GRS for CAD with ï¬rst and third PC, but both GRSs were associated with the cluster membership. Conclusions: Our results indicate that although PCs may help to adjust for population strati ï¬cation, a genetic cluster indicator may be more ef ï¬cient in capturing the con founding due to geographic variation.

Blood platelets destined for the transfusion release panoply of moleculesduring preparation and storage. The leukoreduction process made the transfusion safer but did not abolish the adverse events. The purpose of this work was to study the wholeplatelet transcriptome when found in association with adverse transfusion reactions (ATRs). Methods: Total RNA isolated from six buffy coat derived pooled platelet components (PPC) were sequenced using the Ion Proton Â®technology. The alignment of the reads to the hg19 reference genome were done with STARsoftware. The genes were quanti ï¬ed, using the EM algo rithm method implemented in Partek Flow Â®software. DESeq2, Edge R and Limma voom (three R packages) wereused for differentially expressed (DE) gene identi ï¬cation. Gene Gene interactions and clustering analyses were per formed with STRING db to identify hubs genes and clustersof interests. PANTHER allowed performing the functional enrichment analysis. Results: Among 79 dysregulated DE genes (common with the 3 methods), 6 transcripts (score con ï¬dence: 90%) encoding proteins were found to be related to the dysre gulated network of the cytoskeleton remodeling, associatedwith a cellular reorganization. RhoC was strongly present, with DE genes involved in the signaling of chemokines.

Today, advances in two crucial techniques, high resolution genomic arrays and massive parallel sequencing, makes itpossible to investigate essentially all genes in parallel. A consensus has been established that parallel or sequential genomic array and exome analysis, should be considered asï¬rst line tests in the evaluation of children with e.g., unexplained intellectual disability and/or congenital anomalies. Methods and Results: The main objective of the pre sented work ï¬ow is to provide a smooth and ï¬nancially viable pipeline to diagnose rare disease patients in southernSweden by combining genome wide copy number detection and innovative SNP/UPD analysis of genomic arrays with exome sequencing. The presented results and analysispipeline, including regionally developed bioinformatic and visualization tools, are based on comprehensive clinical validation and experience from 9 years of genomic arrayand 4 years of exome sequencing. A complementary1714method, CytoScan XON, was implemented in 2018 to detect copy number variants down to 1 exon. Conclusions: We conclude that genomic arrays and exome sequencing are broad and powerful methods which complement each other, and we believe these methods provide a strong foundation throughout the foreseen tran sition towards whole genome sequencing. We further con clude that, in a clinical setting, together with careful standardized phenotyping and local expert interpretationand bioinformatic teams, the described work ï¬ow can deli ver a diagnostic yield of >50% at a sustainable cost to the regional health care system.

31074,"Repeat expansions are an important class of genetic variation in neurological diseases and may represent aconvergent aetiological molecular mechanism. However, the identi ï¬cation of novel repeat expansions using conven tional sequencing methods is a challenge due to their typicallengths relative to short sequence reads and dif ï¬culty in producing accurate and unique alignments for repetitive sequence. However, this latter property can be harnessedwhen using paired end short read sequencing data to infer the possible locations of repeat expansions and other structural variation. Here we present REscan, a fast and lightweight command line utility that infers the possible locations of repeat expansions from paired end short read sequencing data byreporting the proportion of reads orientated towards a locus that do not have an adequately mapped mate. A high number for this statistic relative to a population of dataindicates the location of a possible repeat expansion that can be cross referenced against structural variant calls derived from alternative algorithms and brought forward forexperimental follow up. We validate this approach using whole genome sequence data for 259 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, of which 25 are positive for a large hex anucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 , determined by repeat primed PCR. We show that REscan has gooddiscriminative accuracy in identifying repeat expansions from paired end sequence data, and application genome wide can be used in an initial screen to infer the locations of other repeat expansions, thus accelerating the discovery of novel disease relevant genetic variation.

SPiP runs a cascadeof different and complementary tools, chosen on their efï¬ciency, i.e. Splicing Prediction in Consensus Element (SPiCE) for physiological 5 â/3âss, Branch Point Prediction (BPP) for BPs, ÎtESRseq for SREs. Moreover, we embedded a new score for the prediction of cryptic/ de novo ss, after training and validation on more than 200 million of ss obtained through Ensembl data. SPiP was evaluated on a curated diagnostic collection of 2,468 variants (19.8% unpublished) in 345 genes, with theircorresponding experimental RNA splicing data. These variants were scattered along the exonic and intronic sequences up to 36,947 bp from the ss. SPiP achieved anaccuracy of 80.5 %, with a speci ï¬city of 71.3 % and a sensitivity of 91.07 %. As a result, SPiP is a comprehensive prediction pipeline which properly deals with the diversityof possible splicing alterations.

The quality of thoseprimers is critical for a good analysis of the targeted genomic regions during sequencing. The quality of a primer depends on many factors, as for example, the absence ofvariants on the region covered by the primers themselves. A primer with variants would fail to amplify both alleles andconsequently lead to allele dropout in the sequencing results. Given the large amount of primers managed by a laboratory and their quality depending on continually updated data, an automated reassessment is needed. Methods: A web application has been developed using python and the Django web framework. To determine thelocation of the primers on the reference genome we use Blast. The variants present at the location of the primers is recovered through the Ensembl REST API. We imple mented con ï¬gurable validation checks for the primers, such as a maximum MAF for any variant found inside the pri mer. Primers can be reanalyzed at any time to take intoconsideration updated external databases. Results: We developed an open source web based solu tion to validate primers, accessible at https://genetic.tools . Users can be organized in laboratories, sharing primers and validating them whenever public databases such as Gno mad, TOPMed or others update their variant information, orthe reference genome is updated.

We have previously released several RNA seq solutions based onoligo(d)T priming that push the limits of sensitivity and reproducibility from ultra low inputs as well as single cells. Oligo(d)T priming is a very ef ï¬cient way to capture the transcriptome, only the polyadenylated fraction can be captured. In addition, for oligo(dT) primed cDNA synthesis to generate high quality libraries, one needs to start withhigh quality RNA, which excludes the use of this technology with samples damaged or degraded due to the nature of the processing (e.g., FFPE samples) or method ofisolation. Additionally, these earlier single cell kits do not preserve strand of origin information.

Creating such catalogs for small variants from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is now commonly done with joint calling approaches. We have transferred thejoint calling idea to larger deletion variants and developed theï¬rst joint calling tool, PopDel, that can detect deletions in WGS data of tens of thousands of individualssimultaneously. In the joint analysis of hundreds of simulated genomes, PopDel shows similar recall and precision to existing deletion callers while being fasterand requiring less memory. On data of the extensively studied genome NA12878, PopDel identi ï¬es more deletions contained in GiaB and PacBio reference call sets comparedto its competitors Delly and Lumpy. On Illumina Polaris data, PopDel âs deletions distinguish individuals from different populations indicating that the callset re ï¬ects biological differences.

Hurles2 1EMBL EBI, Hinxton, United Kingdom,2Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom Introduction: The spatial distribution of variants in proteins can suggest mechanisms of disruption and canhelp to differentiate benign from damaging changes. However, in rare diseases the sparsity of variants per protein reduces the power of spatial distribution analysis. We overcome this by enriching rare variant data and aligning shared structural domains from different proteins. We then analyse the domains together and uncover spatialpatterns using DBSCAN 3D clustering. Materials and Methods: The variants are mapped from DNA coordinates to the position on the most appropriateprotein structure. They are then grouped by CATH struc tural domain and protein structures within each domain containing a variant are aligned. DBSCAN clustering isthen performed on the 3D coordinates of the variants in the aligned structure space for each CATH domain family. Results: Firstly, comparing the locations of clusters with those of known disease associated variants and those con sidered benign can help to assign a pathogenicity prob ability to variants of unknown signi ï¬cance. Secondly, the location of the cluster in the protein or complex can suggest potential mechanisms of action such as the interruption of ligand binding, catalysis or structure destabilization/mis folding. Thirdly by comparing members of the same spatial clusters with gene lists of known disease association we can uncover new disease gene candidates. Conclusion: Enrichment and spatial clustering of rare variants on protein structures can allow disease sensitive regions of proteins to be uncovered, new disease associatedgenes to be found and can help to characterise variants of unknown signi ï¬cance.

Whereas coding SNPs and InDels have been the focus of intense study, and rare small variants havebeen implicated in about 40% of rare genetic developmental disorder diagnoses, little is known about the mechanisms and disease impact underlying non coding variation. Noncoding SNPs can affect regulatory elements and have been causally linked to Mendelian disorders. SVs can alter the genome by duplicating, deleting, inverting or translocatinggenomic segments. SVs, in particular, are poorly under stood, mainly because of the dif ï¬culties inherent with their reliable detection and phasing via short read sequencingtechnology. Genomic alterations that remain cryptic to current sequencing technology are likely to represent a signiï¬cant source of disease causing variation in unsolved Mendelian disorders.

Although the majority of UPDs does not have phenotypic consequences, particular events may lead to disease due to imprinting effects, an underlying homozygous pathogenic disease variant or a low mosaictrisomy of the respective chromosome. UPD were typically identi ï¬ed by SNP microarrays during routine genetic diagnostics. Here we present a validated method to detectUPDs in both trio and single whole exome sequencing (WES) data. Material and Methods: We applied UPDio for the detection of UPD based on Mendelian inheritance errors to a cohort of 4,912 WES trios and used identi ï¬ed regions of homozygosity (ROH) by H3M2 for isodisomy UPD (iUPD)detection to a cohort of 29,723 single WES samples. We calculated per chromosome whether the ROH size deviated signiï¬cantly from the log normal distribution and we reported cases with ROH involving a whole chromosome. Results: Among the 4,912 WES trios we identi ï¬ed 9 (0.18%) UPD events, 3 of which involved isodisomy and 6heterodisomy. In the cohort of 29,723 single cases we found 13 (0.04%) iUPD events, including the 3 found in trios. At least 11/22 UPD ï¬ndings had previously been reported. Two involved a known imprinted chromosome disorder and in at least four patients a homozygously mutated disease gene was identi ï¬ed. Conclusions: UPD can be identi ï¬ed using both single and trio WES. UPD can be clinically relevant and may affect genetic counseling, given the reduced risk of recur rence for affected families. K.

31081,"Paragon Genomics, Inc., Hayward, CA, United States Introduction: Liquid biopsy is a noninvasive easily obtainable sample with diagnostic value, especially using cell free DNA (cfDNA). But it presents challenges towardaccurate variant detection, as low fractions of mutant DNA present can be masked by artifacts or background noise from PCR and sequencing errors, leading to false negatives. Progress has been made using hybrid capture based1718sequencing methods using unique molecular identi ï¬ers (UMIs), but can be time consuming with complicated and tedious work ï¬ows, resulting in poor results. Large amounts of cfDNA for these protocols are not realistic to obtain from patients. To provide a fast (4 hour) and reliable NGS solution for low frequency variant detection, we developedthe CleanPlex Â®UMI technology. Methods: CleanPlex Â®UMI technology features 3 steps to generate molecular barcoded NGS libraries: multiplex PCRfor molecular barcoding, background cleaning step to remove PCR by products, and indexing PCR to add Illu mina Â®adapters and sample indexes. Here we present a panel targeting frequently mutated hotspots in 23 genes in lung cancer. Libraries were prepared with reference cfDNA (SeraCare) at 0.1% to 0.5% minor allele frequencies (mAF)and sequenced using Illumina Â®NextSeq Â®. Results: With CleanPlex UMI Lung Cancer panel at input of 50ng cfDNA nearly all mutations are detected at0.1% mAF and at 0.25% mAF with 100% PPV. With input of 20 ng of cfDNA, the method can achieve 100% detection at 0.5% mAF. Conclusion: The CleanPlex Â®UMI technology demon strates high sensitivity with low false positive rate, for the detection of low frequency alleles, even at low DNA inputswith an easy cost effective work ï¬ow.

The aim of this study is to investigate the level of variant misclassi ï¬cation from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and theannotation concordance between databases in depth. Materials and Methods: We used a total of 166,834 classi ï¬ed variants [disease causing mutations (DM, n,157,874) and disease associated polymorphisms (DP, n,3,275; DFP, n ,2,009; FP, n ,3,676)] from the HGMD. All variants were reanalyzed based on the American Col lege of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline and compared to ClinVar variants. Misclassi ï¬cation types were categorized into major discordance (from pathogenicto benign or vice versa) and minor discordance (from pathogenic to variants of unknown signi ï¬cance or vice versa). Results: According to variant classi ï¬cation based on ACMG guideline, major discordance were observed in 0.1% (559/157,874) of DMs and 6.2% (129/3,676) ofpolymorphisms. Major discordance was frequently observed in nonsense (41.3%), splicing (10.6%), or frame shift (29.8%) variants, while minor discordance wasoccurred in nonsynonymous variants (84.9%). Overall concordance between HGMD and ClinVar were 89.9% (39,792/44,772) variants studied. The remaining 10.1% ofvariants was discordant classi ï¬cation, most of which are nonsynonymous variants. Conclusions: Variant classi ï¬cation from databases needs to use with caution when interpreting pathogenicity of variants. We found that signi ï¬cant number of loss of function variants, which was reported pathogenic in data bases may not be pathogenic. This is the ï¬rst study to reveal misclassi ï¬cation burden of the HGMD variants and anno tation concordance at the genome wide level. K. Park: None. W. Lee: None.",2019

After analysis and annotation of exomes andwhole genomes we are presented with thousands of candidate variants that calls for further investigation. One of the most effective and unbiased way to reduce thisnumber is to assess the rarity of a variant in any population. This approach is especially powerful when working in the ï¬eld of rare diseases. Currently there are a number of reliable sources of information for major population frequencies when considering single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small indels, with gnomAD as the mostprominent public resource available. In contrast, for structural variation (SV), the background frequency in the general population is more or less unknown mostly due tochallenges in calling SVs in a consistent way. Keeping track of local variation can reduce the number of potential disease causing variants, both for SNVs and SVs, in a considerableway. Here, we present loqusdb , a tool to solve the problem of keeping track of any type of variant frequencies. Loqusdb was designed to handle a large ï¬ow of samples and unlike other solutions samples can be added con tinuously to the database without rebuilding which simpli ï¬es the situation. We show both how powerful SV analysis can be when considering population frequencies and also how the number of SNV/INDELS can be reduced by adding local population frequency information even afterannotating with gnomAD.

For geneticallyheterogeneous diseases where missense variants constitute the preponderance of disease causing variants, this leads to high rates of variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance in known disease genes and false negative test results, as many variants detected in patients will be novel or poorly characterised. We compared rare variants in large case cohorts of inherited cardiac conditions to reference populations to identify variant classes with high prior likelihoods ofpathogenicity, de ï¬ned by etiological fraction (EF). Analysis of variant distribution using a bespoke unsupervised clus tering algorithm identi ï¬ed gene regions where case variants are signi ï¬cantly clustered. Non truncating variant cate gories with EF â¥0.95 were identi ï¬ed in 5 established hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) genes and high EFregions de ï¬ned in major arrhythmia genes ( RYR2 /SCN5A ). We propose adaptations to ACMG/AMP guidelines to incorporate this quantitative evidence and demonstratesubstantial increases in diagnostic rates, e.g. a 14 20% relative increase in HCM cases with actionable variants. Particular variants classes are empirically shown to have a sufï¬ciently high probability of pathogenicity to support a âlikely pathogenic âclassi ï¬cation when found in patients, even without segregation or functional evidence. Our pro posed adaptations to ACMG/AMP guidelines can be seamlessly incorporated into clinical genetics laboratory workï¬ows for diseases with large genetic datasets.

Nohzadeh Malakshah, M. Falcioni, E. Kiruluta, F. M. De La Vega Fabric Genomics, Oakland, CA, United StatesThe ACMG/AMP evidence based guidelines for variant pathogenicity assessment de ï¬ne several criteria assessing particular supporting evidence information. Criteria are combined to classify a variant as either pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), benign (B), likely benign (LB), oruncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS). Although widely adopted in clinical interpretation of variants this process has remained largely manual and time consuming. Current informaticstools aimed to ease the application of the guidelines do not completely automate the entire process. Therefore, we developed an arti ï¬cial intelligence method to automatically infer the classi ï¬cation of variants that utilizes a forward chaining inference engine at its core to implement the ACMG AMP criteria returning a predicted classi ï¬cation for each variant. The engine is able to incorporate criteria and rule re ï¬nements for speci ï¬c genes by separating the rule speciï¬cation from the code that executes them. Natural language generation provides explanatory text with the rationale of the classi ï¬cation attained for reference by clinical geneticists. To evaluate the performance of ourmethod, we analyzed a set of 19,990 variants for a 15 gene hereditary breast and ovarian cancer panel with prior classi ï¬cations from ClinVar (2 +stars) and Color Genomics database used as ground truth. We show automatic classi ï¬cation of 91.6% of P/LP and 60% of B/LB ClinVar variants with essentially no misclassi ï¬cations. Unclassi ï¬ed variants are annotated with resolved guideline criteria for rapid manual assessment to ï¬nalize classi ï¬cation. In addition, we show the ability to reclassify 76% previouslyVUS variants of the Color database.

Critical information such as population allele frequencies, the predicted molecular consequences ofvariants and observed associations with phenotype often lie in decentralized large scale resources and are time consuming to integrate. We import and harmonize phenotype and disease anno tations from sources including ClinVar, DGVa/dbVar, the NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog, DDG2P, Orphanet, MIMmorbid and the Cancer Gene Census into a standard struc ture and provide simple tools for data access. To facilitate improved querying across conditions described differently in different studies and support aggregated views in the Ensembl genome browser, we map the phenotype descriptions used in these projects to ontol ogy terms. We have recently updated the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) to provide enhanced phenotype and disease annotations alongside predicted molecular con sequence and frequency data. We have also recently extended our REST API to support detailed querying of these data. In Ensembl release 96 (April 2019) we have 54,859 human phenotype/disease annotations associated with genes and 5,910,851 associated with variants from 15 differentsources. These can be extracted using a variety of interfaces and are available for variant annotation with VEP. We import an extensive range of phenotype and disease annotations into one uni ï¬ed resource.

Its implementation in a diagnostic setting will homogenize the molecular laboratory work ï¬ow, offer a single test for multiple conditions, and may ultimately decrease cost and time to diagnosis. Although the bioinformatics pipelines used for analyzing WGS andWES are very similar, implementing WGS analysis in routine diagnosis is hampered by the huge amount of data generated. In the ICON GAP project, we developed andevaluated new solutions for WGS data analysis. First, we implemented GATK Base Quality Score Recalibration in the new version of elPrep, a high performance tool forpreparing BAM ï¬les for variant calling. The use of elPrep to sort BAM ï¬les, remove duplicates and perform base quality score recalibration produces the same output as thetraditional samtools/Picard/GATK approach but runs seven times faster on WGS data. Second, we integrated this version of elPrep in Halvade, a framework for executingpipelines in parallel. Halvade âse fï¬cient parallelization enabled to complete the analysis of a 30X WGS in three hours. Finally, we compared the results obtained usingelPrep and Halvade to those obtained using the Broad Institute production pipeline run on the Google Genomics cloud using well characterized cell lines. In conclusion, wedeveloped and optimized a software infrastructure that signiï¬cantly minimizes the computational needs for WGS, hence enabling the short term implementation of WGS intofull diagnostic use.

However, most clinical WGS bioinformatic pipelines overlook variations in short tandem repeat (STR) regions, which constitute ~3% of our genomes. Several algorithms to analyze STRs in WGS data have beendeveloped recently, yet a comprehensive characterization of their reliability in detecting and sizing STR expansions is lacking. Methods: We compared the performance of eight avail able STR algorithms (lobSTR, RepeatSeq, HipSTR, TREDPARSE, ExpansionHunter, STRetch, exSTRa andGangSTR) on the European Genome phenome Archive dataset of 118 Coriell genomes with known repeat expan sion mutations in one of eight different disease associatedSTR loci. We evaluated the sensitivity of the tools in detecting the disease associated full mutation (FM) expan sions in this gold standard dataset and ascertained theconcordance between estimated and actual repeat lengths. Results: lobSTR, RepeatSeq and HipSTR failed to detect STR expansions altogether, while TREDPARSE, Expan sionHunter, STRetch, exSTRa and GangSTR exhibited 100% sensitivity in detecting FMs at ARandATN1 loci, and identi ï¬ed FMs in 94 100%, 85 100% and 50 100% of DMPK ,HTT and ATXN1 expansion positive samples, respectively. Only ExpansionHunter, GangSTR and STRetch identi ï¬ed the single ATXN3 FM sample, whereas none of the algorithms reliably detected FMR1 FMs. TREDPARSE and GangSTR did not identify the homo zygous FXN FM expansions, while STRetch, Expansion Hunter and exSTRa exhibited sensitivities of 79%, 57% and 29%, respectively. While most callers appeared to perform well in sizing non expanded alleles, ExpansionHunter âs repeat size estimates, in general, were closer to the actual lengths of both non expanded and expanded STR alleles.

However, due to high raw read error rates (10 15%), it has remained dif ï¬cult to call small variants from long reads. Recent improvements in library preparation andsequencing chemistry have increased length, accuracy, and throughput of PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads, resulting in 10 20kb reads with average read quality above 99%. Materials and Methods: We sequenced a 12kb library from human reference sample HG002 to 18 fold coverageon the PacBio Sequel II System with three SMRT Cells 8M. The CCS algorithm was used to generate highly accurate (average 99.8%) 11.4kb reads, which were mapped to thehg19 reference with pbmm2. We detected small variants using Google DeepVariant with a model trained for CCS and phased the variants using WhatsHap. Structural variantswere detected with pbsv. Variant calls were evaluated against Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) benchmarks. Results: With these reads, DeepVariant achieves SNP and Indel F1 scores of 99.82% and 96.70% against the GIAB truth set, and pbsv achieves 95.94% recall on struc tural variants longer than 50bp. Using WhatsHap, smallvariants were phased into haplotype blocks with 105kb N50. The improved mappability of long reads allows us to align to and detect variants in medically relevant genes suchasCYP2D6 andPMS2 that have proven ""dif ï¬cult to map"" with short reads. Conclusions: These highly accurate long reads combine the mappability and ability to detect structural variants of long reads with the accuracy and ability to detect small variants of short reads. W.

31090,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common subtype of the motor neuron diseases. The clinical heterogeneity of ALS may re ï¬ect a complex disease etiology, caused in part by large genetic heterogeneityamong patients. Despite a clear genetic contribution to ALS, epigenomic molecular events such as DNA methylation (DNAm) may also play a role in ALS. DNAm differencesbetween cases and could re ï¬ect both cause or consequences of disease. Here we applied the OmicS data based Complex trait Analysis (OSCA) software to new ALS (782 cases and613 controls). OSCA implements mixed linear model approaches to account for unknown confounders by ï¬tting a random effect of genome wide methylation with variance covariance structure estimated from the data and thus controls for the high false positive rate in standard linear models with little loss of power. We identi ï¬ed 10 sig niï¬cantly differentially methylated CpGs between ALS cases and controls and estimate the proportion of variance explained by all probes to be Ï 2,16.1%. Finally, out of sample prediction with ALS derived BLUP solutions of the probes effects, gives signi ï¬cant predictive accuracy (AUC ,62%, CI 95%,[0.59 0.64], p value ,9.3x10 14).

However, for the majority of loci, the biological mechanisms through which the associated variants exert their functional effects remain elusive. Among them, the 4q21.21 risk locus located intronically inFGF5 , a known inhibitor of human hair growth. Of note, premature termination of hair growth is a key pathophy siological sign of MPB. To gain a deeper understanding of the regulatory architecture at the FGF5 locus and its effect on MPB development a HaploRegv4.0 query was per formed. The database research revealed that the lead SNP rs4690116 is located in an estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)binding site. This is of particular interest, as estrogens have a reported role in hair growth control and act as opponents of androgens, the key hormonal mediators in MPB. To testif the risk allele may affect ESR1 binding af ï¬nity, which might eventually result in an insuf ï¬cient inhibition of FGF5 we designed a luciferase assay where we co transfect (i) aluciferase vector containing the FGF5 promoter and the 4q21.21 ESR1 binding site with either the risk or the alternate allele and (ii) an ESR1 expression vector. Estrogen stimulation is used to induce ESR1 function. First results in HEK293T cells indicate an inhibition of the FGF5 promoter under estrogen stimulation. Additional experi ments are currently performed and the results will be presented at the conference. These data will elucidate the molecular mechanism at the FGF5 locus and will even tually contribute to a deeper understanding of MPB pathobiology. L. M. Hochfeld: None. C. Walter: None. S.

Epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) havemainly investigated DNA methylation and its association with disease or traits, exposure factors or gene expression. This systematic review aimed to identify all EWASassessing differentially methylated sites associated with asthma in humans.1724Design: Structured systematic literature search following PRISMA guidelines, Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was used for bias assessment. Data Sources: We searched PubMed and Embase data bases from 2005 through 2019. Eligibility Criteria: EWAS studies testing association between differential methylation and asthma in humans. Results: Overall, we identi ï¬ed sixteen EWAS studies complying with our search criteria. Twelve studies wereconducted on children and ten were conducted on sample sizes less than 150 subjects. Four hundred and nineteen CpGs were reported in children studies after correction formultiple testing. In adult studies, thousands of differentially methylated sites were identi ï¬ed. Differential methylation in inï¬ammatory related genes correlated with higher levels of gene expressions of in ï¬ammatory modulators in asthma. Differentially methylated genes associated with asthma included SMAD3, SERPINC1, PROK1, IL13, RUNX3 and TIGIT . Fourty one CpGs were replicated at least once in blood samples, and 28 CpGs were replicated in nasal samples. Conclusion: Although many differentially methylated CpGs in genes known to be involved in asthma have been identi ï¬ed in EWAS to date, we conclude that further studies of larger sample sizes and analyses of differential methy lation between different phenotypes are needed.

The credible SNPs were cross referenced with Roadmap chromatin states associated with enhancer activity from esophageal tissue. We functionally annotated variants located in enhancers and investigatednearby genes regarding their function. Based on thisAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1725information, the risk loci were prioritized for subsequent functional follow up analyses. As a ï¬rst result, two credible SNPs at the 5p15 locus are located in an enhancer upstream SLC9A3 , which encodes an epithelial brush border Na H exchanger. Both SNPs, as well as the best associated SNP at 5p15, are eQTLs forSLC9A3 . Interestingly, upregulation of SLC9A3 has been associated to gastroesophageal re ï¬ux disease a major risk factor for BE/EA. In order to unveil regulatory mechanisms that are involved in the development of BE/EA, we are now per forming functional analyses. This includes 4C sequencingand dual luciferase assays in cells of all stages of BE/EA development. Altogether, our systematic approach of functional characterization of genetic risk factors will con tribute to the elucidation of pathomechanisms involved in the development of BE/EA. J.

Interspecies divergence of regulatory elements as well as trans acting factors are likely to contribute to human traits. Here we used bulk and single cell RNA seq in combination with in depth proteomics to compare human and chimpanzee iPSC derived forebrain progenitors. We found that interspecies differences inprotein levels exceeded the differences in transcript levels. Lowly and moderately expressed proteins were found to contribute to most of the human chimpanzee expressiondifferences, while highly expressed proteins remained at similar levels. Our data indicate that post transcriptional mechanisms and trans acting elements play a crucial role in the evolution of the human forebrain.

Development of chromatinconformation study techniques has identi ï¬ed several long range regulatory elements as involved in this control expression. The objective of this project is to study theinvolvement of âcis ruption â, that is the dysfunction of a cis regulatory element, in cystic ï¬brosis and CFTR RD (Congenital Bilateral Absence of Vas Deferens , CBAVD). In a homogeneous group of 25 CBAVD patients carrying only one F508del mutation, 17 cis regulatory regions of CFTR gene were sequenced. By comparing to European population, some variants display a frequency signi ï¬cantly different. In particularly, one variant located in cis 1726regulatory region of intron 21 encompassing an important transcription factor binding site EP300, is 40 times more frequent in this group. Enhancer tests are realised to measure the effect of the intron 21 region on the activity of CFTR promoter in intestinal and airway cells. By combin ing the enhancer of intron 21 and the enhancer of intron 11(strong enhancer described in intestinal cells), a strong cooperative effect is observed on the CFTR promoter activity in intestinal cells. These two enhancers havecommon transcription factor binding sites which some interact together (EP300/TCF12 and EP300/CEBPB). Enhancer tests with the insertion of the variant of interestin the combination of intron 11 and 21 enhancers are in progress to determine the impact of the variant on the CFTR promoter activity. M.

Defects in components of the epigenetic machinerylead to a highly heterogeneus group of syndromic conditions, we termed âChromatinopathies âcharacterized by intellectual disability, growth abnormalities, and typicalfacial features. Material and Methods: We designed a NGS targeted panel containing 68 genes associated with chromatino pathies including Kabuki, Kleefstra, Cof ï¬n Lowry, Wie demann Steiner, Rubinstein Taybi, Floating Harbor, and Cornelia de Lange syndromes. Results: Driven by clinical diagnosis, we analyzed 253 patients and found pathogenic variants in 60 (24%). Themain sub groups consist of 120 Kabuki syndrome patients, 33 (28%) of them carrying KMT2D orKDM6A pathogenic variants, Rubinstein Taybi syndrome patients, with 12/47 (25%) subjects carrying EP300 orCREBBP pathogenic variants and Floating Harbor syndrome patients, with 3/19 (16%) subjects carrying SRCAP pathogenic variants. Con sidering the clinical overlapping and shared molecular mechanisms among the Chromatinopathies, we extended thein silico variants analysis to all patients. 42/193 (22%) of patients showed pathogenic variants in genes not asso ciated with the original clinical suspicion. A re evaluation of the clinic signs in part con ï¬rmed the molecular data. Some examples include KS patients found mutated in KMT2A ,CTCF andARID1B ; RSTS patients with frameshift and nonsense variants in KMT2A .

There is an increasing evidence that microRNAs may be involved in many disorders as also in diabetes and its complications. Our aim was to evaluate the expression of candidate miRNAs in positive and negative patients for both forms of diabetic neuropathy. We recruited 50 T2D patients withneurological evaluation. We extracted RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and quanti ï¬ed the expression of 6 miRNAs (miR 499a, miR 27a, miR 146a, miR 128a, miR 155, miR 21) by TaqMan assays. The expression in different groups was compared by ANOVA test. InAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1727addition, we extracted DNA from the patients âwhole blood, analyzed common polymorphisms of the MIRNA gene and evaluated the possible correlation between genetic variants and miRNA levels expression. Patients with DPN showed a higher expression of miR 128a compared to those DPN negative (P ,0.015). In contrast, miR 155 and miR 499 seem to be down expressed in patients with DPN (P ,0.04 and P,0.05, respectively). We observed a lower expression of miR 155 (P ,0.05) even in patients with CAN respect to CAN negative patients. Genotypic analysis showed that rs767649 polymorphism variant allele in the miR 155 promoter region is associated with a higher expression ofthis miRNA (P ,0.003) compared to the wild type allele. Our data suggest the involvement of miRNAs in the development of diabetic complications. If these preliminaryresults will be validated in more numerous cohorts, these miRNAs could be considered potential biomarkers for the development of diabetic neuropathy. A. Latini: None. C.

We aimed toinvestigate the role of DNA methylation on miR 146a expression in OA synoviocytes. Material and Methods: miR 146a expression levels were investigated in OA (n ,16) and normal synoviocytes (n,9) using qRT PCR. The methylation status of miR 146a promoter was analysed using quantitative methylation speciï¬c PCR (qMSP) and bisul ï¬te DNA sequencing assay. The effect of 5 â Aza 2 deoxycytidine (5 AzadC) and siRNA against NF kB on miR 146a expression was inves tigated. In addition, NF KB binding to miR 146a promoter was assessed by Ch ÎP. Results: miR 146a expression levels were signi ï¬cantly reduced in OA compared with normal synoviocytes. Downregulation of miR 146a was correlated with increasedmethylation of miR 146a promoter in OA synoviocytes and weaker binding af ï¬nity of NF kB on this hypermethylated region in OA synoviocytes. Signi ï¬cant upregulation of miR 146a was observed in 5 AzadC treated OA synovio cytes compared with untreated, which was associated with demethylation of miR 146a promoter. Inhibition of NF kBreversed the effect of 5 AzadC on miR 146a expression in OA synoviocytes. Conclusion: We demonstrated, for the ï¬rst time to our knowledge, that DNA methylation regulates miR 146a expression in OA synoviocytes, by preventing NF kB from binding to miR 146a promoter. These data provide strong evidence that epigenetic mechanisms could regulate the expression of miRNAs linked to OA pathogenesis.

Davis New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, United StatesDNA methylation is important for gene regulation. The ability to accurately identify 5 methylcytosine (5mC) and 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) gives us greater insight into potential regulatory mechanisms. Bisul ï¬te sequencing (BS) is traditionally used to detect methylated C's, however, BSdoes have its drawbacks. DNA is commonly damaged and degraded by the chemical bisul ï¬te reaction resulting in libraries that demonstrate high GC bias and are enriched formethylated regions. To overcome these limitations, we developed an enzymatic approach, NEBNext Â® Enzymatic Methyl Seq (EM Seq â¢), for methylation detection. Illumina libraries were prepared using bisul ï¬te and EM Seq methods. Libraries generated with NA12878 DNA inputs ranging from 10 ng to 200 ng were sequenced usingIllumina âs NovaSeq 6000. EM Seq libraries have longer inserts, lower duplication rates, a higher percentage of mapped reads and less GC bias compared to bisul ï¬te con verted libraries. Global methylation levels are similar between EM seq and whole genome bisul ï¬te libraries1728(WGBS) indicating overall detection of methylated C's is similar. However, CpG correlation plots demonstrated higher correlation coef ï¬cients indicating that EM Seq libraries are more consistent than WGBS across replicates and input amount. GC bias and dinucleotide distribution showed that EM Seq has more even dinucleotide repre sentation compared to the AT rich representation observed for WGBS. EM seq âs more even coverage allows for a higher percentage of CpG's to be assessed leading to moreconsistent evaluation of methylation across key genomic features (TSS, CpG island, etc.). EM seq is more robust than WGBS, works over a wide range of DNA inputamounts, has superior sequencing metrics, and detects more CpG's. B. Sexton: A.

Adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are characterized by unique molecular features. Recent studies have revealed that cancer related changes in DNA methylation are not random, and subsets of genes are selectively affected. The aim of theresearch was to characterize methylome pro ï¬les of AC and SCC tumors, and to develop novel prognostic biomarkers speciï¬c for both sub types. Materials and Methods: For large scale methylome proï¬ling, reduced representation bisul ï¬te sequencing (RRBS) in 123 patients with NSCLC was carried out. Thepaired analyses of lung tumor and adjacent normal tissue of patients grouped into several comparison sets was per formed. Then, using binary segmentation algorithm, dif ferentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identi ï¬ed. Results: Hundreds of DMRs were identi ï¬ed in NSCLC; vast majority of them exhibited hypomethylation in patientswith relapse or who died. In tumors of SCC patients with relapse, several DMRs were detected within GATA2 gene, playing a role in an aggressiveness of lung cancer andespecially important in patients with KRAS mutations. Interestingly, a distinctive methylation levels were observed forRUVBL1 related DMRs in SCC and AC patients with relapse. Hypomethylation of PRKCA , which exhibits sup pressor activity in lung cancers, was identi ï¬ed in AC patients who eventually did not survive. Conclusion: Obtained results allow for better under standing of speci ï¬c epigenetic pathways dysregulated in different sub types of NSCLC.

The activity state of enhancers may change dynamically across distinguishableconditions, for instance across varying time points, cell lines or disease states. However, it remains a challenge to identify these regulatory elements in a cell type or even disease state dependent manner. Thus, rather than compar ing separated epigenetic signature tracks we propose an approach to computationally map and compare enhancersacross different samples and conditions. Additionally, to get a glimpse of the underlying causative regulatory mechan ism, these dynamic enhancer elements need to be furtherassociated with promoter activity across the same conditions. Here we present the three step framework CRUP (Con dition speci ï¬c Regulatory Units Prediction) to collapse different layers of epigenetic information into a single list of regulatory units consisting of dynamically changingenhancers and target genes. The work ï¬ow includes a pre trained enhancer classi ï¬er that can be applied across dif ferent cell lines and species, solely based on histone mod iï¬cation ChIP seq data. Enhancers are subsequently assigned to different conditions and correlated with gene expression to derive regulatory units within the sametopologically associated domain. We thoroughly test and then apply CRUP to murine embryonic stem cells to capture dynamic enhancer regionsthat are associated with retinoic acid signaling.

However, the transcriptional regulatory elements during human inhibitory interneuron differentiation and their role in neurodevelopmental disorders are unknown. Here, wegenerated gene regulatory element maps of human inhibitory like interneurons derived from embryonic stem cells (H9 ESC), permitting large scale annotation ofpreviously uncharacterized regulatory elements relevant to inhibitory interneuron differentiation. Our analyses identify neuronal progenitor enhancers that likely regulate theexpression of transcription factors that are essential for interneuron differentiation. One of these transcription factors is FOXG1 that is speci ï¬cally expressed in interneuron progenitors. Haploinsuf ï¬ciency of FOXG1, is associated with Rett like syndrome. Using in vivo enhancer assay, we identi ï¬ed eight transcriptional enhancers in the FOXG1 locus with activity patterns that resembled FOXG1 expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we deleted two FOXG1 enhancers which reduced FOXG1 expression in human U251 cells and altered cell prolifera tion. Furthermore, a microdeletion proximal to FOXG1 encompassing these neuronal FOXG1 enhancers was foundin patient with Rett like syndrome, supporting the role of FOXG1 enhancers in this syndrome.

Both diseases are multifactorial, and GWAS meta analyses have identi ï¬ed 14 risk loci so far. All risk variants are located in non coding genomic regions and therefore our under standing of biological mechanisms underlying these associations is incomplete. Here, we aimed at (i) character izing BE/EA genetic associations using eQTL data fromtwo relevant tissues, and (ii) investigating the biological function of eQTL genes. For this, we generated two eQTL datasets from biopsies derived from healthy gastric cardiatissue (n ,148), and from esophageal metaplasia tissue (n,83). The eQTL analysis revealed 145,011 signi ï¬cant cis eQTLs in cardia and 50,517 signi ï¬cant cis eQTLs in metaplasia tissue. We cross referenced the eQTL data with genetic association data of BE/EA. Here, we identi ï¬ed cis eQTL effects for genome wide signi ï¬cantly associated BE/ EA risk variants regulating the expression of C2orf43 / LDAH (2p24) in cardia tissue. In metaplasia, only suggestively associated variants (P<5Ã10 04) represented cis eQTLs, with regulating effects on SMPD2 (6q21) and NADSYN1 (11q13). Next, we performed a functional enrichment analysis with eQTL genes present in cardiatissue only (n ,2,557), metaplasia tissue only (n ,1,028), and both tissues (n ,585). We observed an enrichment of metaplasia eQTL genes in immunological pathways,whereas cardia eQTL genes were enriched in metabolic processes. eQTL genes expressed in both tissues were enriched in pathways involved in degradation of extra cellular matrix.

Tumor expression of estrogen receptor is an important marker of prognosis and is predictive of response to endocrine therapy in luminalbreast cancer (BC). Indeed, promoter hypermethylation could lead to a change in ESR1 gene expression pro ï¬le, which interferers with endocrine therapy, leading toresistance. Materials and Methods: ccfDNA was isolated from plasma samples from 11 metastatic breast cancer patientsand 8 healthy volunteers. For absolute quanti ï¬cation of ESR1 promoter methylation levels, bisul ï¬te converted ccfDNA was used and ddPCR was performed with twoprobes, one speci ï¬c for methylated DNA and one speci ï¬c for un methylated DNA. Results: ESR1 promoter methylation status was tested on ccfDNA samples using ddPCR. To avoid any effect of incomplete bisul ï¬te conversion on accuracy of methylation detection, primers pairs were designed to target only con verted cytosine residues. ESR1 promoter resulted un methylated in all healthy donors âccfDNA samples. A variable degree of methylation was assessed betweenpatients âsamples. Conclusions: Droplet digital PCR methodology is an endpoint PCR method that does not require standard curvesfor absolute quanti ï¬cation and can be easily optimized to assess low amount and fragmentated samples such asccfDNA.

31107,"Russian Federation Introduction: Currently, based on the size of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene and the methylation status of its promoter region, the variation in symptom severity inFragile X associated disorders cannot be explained. In this study, our hypothesis assumed that non coding RNAs, such as miRNAs and FMR1 antisense transcripts, are involved in the pathology of Fragile X associated disorders. Materials and Methods: Immortalized B lymphocyte cell lines from patients with different FMR1 gene alleles were used. The expression of genes and miRNAs were analyzed by SYBR and TaqMan PCR, respectively. MicroRNAs were selected using the miRBase, microRNAand TargetScan databases. Results: Using the databases, a number of miRNAs that bind to the 3 â UTR of the FMR1 gene were selected. It was shown that the expression of some miRNAs in groups with different FMR1 gene activities changes relative to control cell lines. Next, it was shown that the expression of theantisense transcript, ASFMR1 , which contains a GCC repeat and is a potential source of miRNA, as well as the general expression of all isoforms, also changes relative to controls. Based on the results, a new model is proposed for the participation of noncoding RNAs in Fragile X associated pathologies.

Given the contribution of adipose tissue to disease risk, we aimed to uncoverbiological signatures characteristic of each tissue, and to explore ï¬ne scale gene regulation. Materials and Methods: Blood and biopsies of S and V fat were collected for 106 Greek individuals (GM study), spanning the BMI range. We explored gene expression (RNA Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC Seq) inboth tissues, and applied QTLtools software to identify regulatory variants (eQTLs). We explored replication of ï¬ndings in GTEX (pi1, bootstrapping) and across tissues (pi1, RTC, linear models) to uncover associations char acteristic of the GM sample and of each tissue respectively. Results: Gene expression and chromatin accessibility differences across S and V fat reveal processes linked to development, cell signaling, and immune and nervous systems. Notably, we detected signi ï¬cant downregulation of metabolic processes in S fat from obese individuals. We report that ~90% of associations replicate in GTEX, but deï¬ne a subset of GM detected ï¬ndings likely driven by environmental effects. Although ~95% of eQTLs are com mon across tissues, we uncover gene regulatory differences at the ï¬ne scale, and highlight subtle differences in gene regulation across tissues. We also report that ~30% of eQTLs explain disease association signals. Conclusions: Ourï¬ndings contribute to a better com prehension of fat depot speci ï¬c biology providing insights into biological mechanisms underlying adipose related disease pathogenesis.

31109,"Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, United StatesGenome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system is moving towards therapeutic applications, which drives an increasedneed for in depth characterization of both on and off target genome editing events. Here we present a work ï¬ow and useful guidelines for prediction, validation, quanti ï¬cation, and analysis of on and off target editing events. First, we provide comparison of several commonly used off target prediction tools for in silico selection of target sites throughout the genome. Then, using previously published, unbiased methods for experimental off target validation, we are able to compare these algorithm based selections tobona ï¬de sites exhibiting editing mediated by more than twelve guide RNAs. The unbiased detection methods are carried out with experimental and bioinformatics advance ments to improve the ef ï¬ciency of empirical off target validation. A multiplexed, amplicon based enrichment method (rhAmpSeq TM) for next generation sequencing is then employed for strict quanti ï¬cation of editing events at validated as well as predicted off target sites. The rhAmpSeq technology enables interrogation of >1000genomic loci in a single reaction using RNase H2 cleavable primers which facilitate almost complete suppres sion of non target location and primer dimer ampli ï¬cation. Moreover, amplicon coverage is uniform and reproducible, removing the need for primer re balancing. The relationship between coverage depth and statistical con ï¬dence in quanti ï¬cation of editing events was characterized. Finally, we developed and rigorously validated a data analysis package to con ï¬dently detect Cas9 edits via synthetic reads that contain diverse editing events and varied genomic target complexities.

However, many of those variants are intergenic and some are located on functionally uncharacterized long non codingRNAs (lncRNAs), several of which have been described to play crucial roles in many in ï¬ammatory disorders. rs2816316 (chr1:192567683) is located near the geneRGS1 (regulator of G protein signalling 1) that has been related to the immune response. The variant has been associated with Celiac Disease (CD) and Multiple Sclerosis(MS), while RGS1 has been related to CD, MS and Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The aim of this study is to functionally characterize the region under this associated SNP in order toexplain its implication in autoimmune disorders. The expression of RGS1 is altered in the immune cells of rs2816316 associated diseases. According to GTEXrs2816316 is an eQTL for RGS1 in gastroesophageal and brain tissues. The UCSC Genome Browser features a functionally uncharacterized lncRNA that contains the SNPand is close to RGS1 . We have observed that this lncRNA is expressed both in immune and epithelial cells and localizes to the nucleus, suggesting a transcription regulatory role. Additionally, CRISPR Cas9 edition of cells showed that the lncRNA and RGS1 present opposite expression trends. Stimulation of Jurkat T cells with PMA and ionomicynprovoked a time shifted activation of RGS1 and the lncRNA. Our results suggest that the region around rs2816316 is involved in RGS1 regulation, probably through a nearby nuclear lncRNA.

Although many studies are conducted related to the mechanisms of action for TKIs like Dasatinib and Ponatinib, their effects on long non codingRNAs (lncRNAs) expression pro ï¬les which are associated with malignancies with their oncogenic/tumor suppressor properties are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed todeï¬ne lncRNAs involved in the treatment of CML with Dasatinib and Ponatinib. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis and lncRNA expression pro ï¬les were evaluated by WST 8 assay, APO DIRECT in ï¬ow cytometry and qRT PCR, respectively. Ponatinib exhibited higher cytotoxic and apoptotic activity than Dasatinib in K562 cells. Apoptosis regulating lncRNAsHULC, HOTAIR, HOXA3AS and ANRIL that suppresses the DNA damage response genes were down regulated, while transcription controller 7S K was up regulated with both TKIs. Among lncRNAs associated with the pathways that are activated by BCR ABL1; BCMS and PTENP1 were regulated with both TKIs, while GAS5 was only regulated withPonatinib. In addition to the up regulation of WT1 AS that suppresses WT1 oncogene by binding to its promoter, a prominent increase in Zeb2NAT and devastating decreases inPSF inhibiting RNA, BC017743, SCA8, and HOTTIP were speciï¬c to Ponatinib treatment. NCRMS, HOTAIRM1, Gomafu alterations were associ ated with Dasatinib speci ï¬c response.

Ð¢he aim of the present study is to analyse and compare the expressionpatterns of miRNAs in ADC and SCC samples Materials and Methods: Fresh frozen tissue samples from 24 non small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) patients(12ADC,12SCC) and adjacent normal tissues were exam ined. The expression of miRNAs was evaluated by Sur ePrint human miRNA microarrays (Agilent Technologies).The normalization of data and the statistical analysis were performed by GeneSpring GXsoftware. Results: We assessed the expression levels of 2549 human mature miRNAs and found 13 to be signi ï¬cantly differentially expressed (fold change (FC)>2.0 and FDR<0.005) between the ADC and adjacent normal tissues. Hsa miR 210 3p, hsa miR 21 3p and hsa miR 130b 3p were upregulated. One hundred twenty eight miRNAswere signi ï¬cantly differentially expressed (FC>2.0 and FDR<0.001) between the SCC and adjacent normal tissues of which 56 were upregulated and 72 downregulated.

The aim of this study was to evaluate theclinical value of DNA methylation (DNAm) in predicting overall survival (OS) as compared to the lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), which is the most usedinï¬ammation based prognostic score in MPM. Materials and Methods: We investigated a cohort of 163 incident cases of MPM diagnosed between 2000 and 2010in the municipalities of Turin, and Casale Monferrato (Piedmont region, Italy), an area with an exceptionally high incidence of mesothelioma caused by asbestos occupationalexposure and contamination in the general environment from the asbestos cement Eternit plant that was operational until 1986. Genome wide methylation array (Human Methylation450 Beadchip) to identify novel blood DNAm markers related to overall survival in MPM was used. Results: Kaplan Meier survival curves highlighted methylation levels at a single CpG in a gene on 6p21.31 (DNAm cut off ,0.45, HR ,2.14, Median Survival ,243 vs 534, days; P ,2.4 Ã 10 â05) as related to OS. Conclusions: Our study is the ï¬rst to demonstrate that a single CpG DNAm in a gene on 6p21.31 is an independent marker of prognosis in patients with MPM and performsbetter than other in ï¬ammation based scores as prognostic factor. DNAm evaluation will enable clinicians to better predict clinically meaningful outcomes such as response tosystemic treatment and to select patients who are most likely to bene ï¬t from intensive therapy.

We have reportedthat phenotypic tumor cell plasticity in a pro in ï¬ammatory microenvironment drives therapy resistance to adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). We suggest that pro in ï¬ammatory responses induce a dedifferentiated phenotype and therapy resistance by changing the epigenetic landscape. Here, we performed an integrative analysis of exome, methylome andtranscriptome pro ï¬les of primary and ACT therapy resistant cell lines in transgenic mouse model of melanoma. Methods: To detect if ACT selects for common muta tions in resistant cell lines, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in primary and therapy resistant cell lines. We used Methylated DNA immunoprecipitationcoupled with next generation sequencing (MeDIP Seq) to track the distribution of methylation alterations in target genomes. Genome wide expression data are generated usingRNA sequencing. Results: We did not ï¬nd a driver alteration in somatic mutation patterns. Differential methylation (DM) analysisfor all samples shows profound clustering for primary cell lines against therapy resistant cell lines. Differential expression (DE) analysis results are consistent with pro found DM clustering in our cell lines. Gene set enrichment and biological pathways analyses for signi ï¬cant DE and DM genes show the highest enrichment scores for devel opmental pathways and differentiation proteins. Outlook: Our results supports the hypothesis that sig niï¬cant changes in methylation marks drive melanoma cell plasticity and immunotherapy resistance in our experi mental model.

Blood DNA methylation and gene expression were assessed with the 450K and the HTA v2 arrays, respec tively. The relationship between methylation levels andexpression of nearby genes (transcription start site within 1 Mb window from CpG) was tested by ï¬tting 13,615,882 linear regressions adjusting for sex, age, cohort and celltype composition. After Bonferroni correction, we found 15,403 cis eQTMs, 9,477 (61.5%) of them showing an inverse association. They included 8,907 unique CpGs and 3,790 unique genes, and mean distance between them was 240 kb. Cis eQTMs were enriched for distant promoters, N and S CpG islandshores, and transcriptional and enhancer blood chromatin states. Genome wide genotypic data is available for these same children and it will be used, in future steps, toinvestigate to which extend cis eQTMs are determined by genetic variants.

Gain of methylation at ICR1 (ICR1 GOM), one of the causative alterations for BWS, is found in 5% of patients, and 20% of ICR1 GOM patients havemutations of OCT binding motif within ICR1. Methylation anticipation of ICR1 upon maternal transmission of the mutation in familial BWS patients was previously reported. However, the extent of anticipation within IGF2 /H19 imprinting domain is still unclear. Materials and Methods: Members of BWS family with an OCT mutation were subjected to this study. Methylation statuses of 10 differentially methylated sites, such as IGF2 DMR0, IGF2 DMR2, CTS1 7, and H19 promoter, were analyzed by quantitative bisul ï¬te pyrosequencing. Results: A patient, mother, and aunt with the mutation showed ICR1 GOM, however, grandmother with themutation and other normal family members did not. CTS2, the second nearest CTS to the mutation, was the most highly methylated site among all sites. Not only sites withinICR1 (CTS 1 6) but also sites outside ICR1 ( IGF2 DMRs, CTS7, and H19 promoter) were more methylated in the patient than in mother and aunt, indicating the methylationanticipation. Furthermore, the extent of anticipation was greater outside ICR1 than inside ICR1. In addition, IGF2 DMR0 was hypomethylated in normal young adults than innormal children, and it was maintained to middle aged adults. Conclusions: Methylation anticipation of ICR1 might be due to failure of maternal methylation erasure during female gametogenesis. The extent of anticipation was greater at the sites far from the mutation. Hypomethylation of IGF2 DMR0 normally occurred in people underage. F. Sun: None. K. Higashimoto: None. H. Soejima: None.

Aguennouz1 1University of Messina, Messina, Italy,2University of Naples, Naples, Italy Pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNETs), are benign tumors, distinguished in ""functioning"" (secreting hormones, causing a hormonal hyperfunction syndrome) such asGrowth hormone (GH) secreting and ""non functioning pituitary adenoma"" NFPA. Usually, PitNETs are associated with many health and mortality complications when notadequately treated. Transphenoidal surgery is considered the treatment choice of PitNETs, followed by medical therapy. Sometimes the treatment is limited to selectedcases, whereby, somatostatin analogs (SSA) are used in GH PitNET. However, 10 30% of patients are not respon der to SSA, suggesting that other molecular mechanismsmay be essential for the response to drug treatment. Therefore, the identi ï¬cation of these mechanisms, allows to classify into subgroups PitNET patients (responders vs.non responders). Epigenetic mechanisms can play a dynamic role in complex diseases such pituitary cancer. These mechanisms, including DNA methylation, in ï¬uence the regulation of genome and the cell function. Our goal is to identify the differential methylation between GH secreting and NFPA tissues. Methods: We analyze DNA methylation data across the genome using (a) traditional coupled t tests to identify signiï¬cantly differentiated methylated loci (P â¤1 Ã 10 7 adjusted with Bonferroni) and (b) new combinatorial algo rithms to identify loci that distinguish between types of fabrics. Results: We obtained 178 target regions that were dif ferentially methylated (corrected P value â¤0.05). Further more, only two regions were signi ï¬cantly hypomethylated in GH compared to NFPA. We have also elucidated gene centric annotations (with ANNOVAR software) to obtain distances from the closest genes and other genomic infor mation relative to the priority regions to fuse these 3 dif ferent pituitary diseases.

Materials and Methods: Blood samples have been col lected from a new cohort of 80 AD and 50 ALS and in 80 Parkinson âs disease (PD) patients as well as from matched controls. DNA methylation analyses have been performedby means of MS HRM and pyrosequencing and mtDNA copy number by means of quantitative PCR. Results: DNA methylation analysis showed that D loop methylation is able to discriminate disease patients and control subjects, and that it is also sensitive to the stage of the disease. Moreover, D loop methylation levels have beenfound to be inversely correlated with mtDNA copy number and to be highly related to age and gender of the individuals enrolled. Conclusions: Results presented in the current study suggest a potential involvement of mitoepigenetics imbal ance in NDs detectable in peripheral blood. Moreover,current results suggest that mtDNA methylation could be sensitive to different disease stages, thus adding a new layer of interest in the search of peripheral mitoepigenetic bio markers for neurodegeneration.

31117,"Dept of Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy Introduction: The MTHFR gene codes for methylenete trahydrofolate reductase, one of the major enzimes involvedin folate metabolism. Impaired MTHFR methylation levels are increasingly recognized to contribute to several human pathological conditions, including male infertility, miscar riage, congenital heart defects, stressful events, cancer, and diabetic complications among others. Previous studies have clearly shown a correlation between circulating folate orhomocysteine levels and MTHFR promoter methylation and gene expression, but little is still known concerning the contribution of polymorphisms in folate metabolic genes toMTHFR promoter methylation levels. Materials and Methods: Two published datasets con taining data on MTHFR promoter methylation and of major polymorphisms in folate metabolic genes have been inves tigated searching for correlation between those poly morphisms and MTHFR promoter methylation levels, for a total of 300 subjects. Both datasets had been previously generated in our laboratory in the frame of a dementia case control study and of a screening for maternal risk factors forDown syndrome, respectively. Results: In both datasets under investigation, as well as in the merged samples, we observed a correlation betweenMTHFR promoter methylation levels and both TYMS 1494del6 ( P,0.007) and DNMT3B 149C>T ( P,0.004) polymorphisms. Conclusions: Present results reveal that certain poly morphisms of folate metabolic genes contribute to MTHFR methylation, suggesting that the expression levels of theMTHFR gene are tightly regulated by both dietary and genetic factors.

31118,"pathways involved in HPV( ) HNSCC have been studied extensively, but we are far from understanding the under lying mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Recently, a subgroupof HPV( ) HNSCC has been characterized by mutations in the Nuclear Receptor binding SET Domain protein 1 (NSD1), suggesting a possible epigenetic etiology of thosetumors. Method: We used two HNSCC cell lines carrying NSD1 truncating mutations (SKN 3 and SCC 4) and comparedthem with two NSD1 wildtype cell lines (Detroit562 and Cal27). In the next step, I produced isogenic cell lines by knocking out NSD1 gene in three NSD1 wild type HNSCCcell lines (FaDu, Detroit562, and Cal27) using CRISPR Cas9 method to see the same result was observed or not. Finally, I chose 2 samples from my Cal27 NSD1 knockouts and knocked out NDS2using the same method, but with differently designed primers. Results: Firstly, disruption of NSD1 âin HNSCC sam ples where NSD1 is naturally disrupted âleads to a global reduction in the H3K36me2 histone modi ï¬cation at the intergenic regions, which is accompanied by a reduction inDNA methylation. Secondly, it was shown that the decrease of H3K36me2 mark in intergenic regions is correlated with increased H3K27me3 in those same regions. Conclusion: So far, we demonstrated that a drastic and global decrease in DNA methylation at intergenic regions is directly associated with the lack of H3K36me2 mark in thesame regions. This study will more speci ï¬cally investigate the role of NSD1 and H3K36me2 mark and will uncover its correlation with H3K27me3 in HNSCC. N. Farhangdoost: None. C. Horth: None. B. Hu: None. E.

The major cause of the bone homeostasis alteration is in ï¬am mation. Epigenetic factors represent a link between individual genetic susceptibility and environmental in ï¬u ences associated with osteoporosis risk. In particular, long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have a crucial role in regulating many important biological processes in bone,including in ï¬ammation. Materials and Methods: We designed our study to identify lncRNAs misregulated in bone cells from OPpatients with the aim to predict possible RNA and/or protein targets implicated in this multifactorial disease. Total RNA was extracted from osteoblast primary cultures derived byOP (n,5), and CTRs (n ,5) individuals. Gene expression has been focused on 84 lncRNAs, validated or predicted, to regulate the expression of in ï¬ammatory genes and miR NAs. In silico analysis using validated bioinformatics tools has been utilized to predict the interaction of lncRNAs with miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins targets. Results: Seven lncRNAs were signi ï¬cantly down regulated in OP patients compared to controls: GRM5 AS1; CEP83 AS1; CTC 487M23.5; GAS5; RP11 84C13.1;NCBP2 AS2 and SDCBP2 AS1. Bioinformatics analyses identi ï¬ed two lncRNAs prediction targets that are impli cated in bone homeostasis and in OP: CTC 487M23.5 thatinteracts with HDAC2 mRNA (a key positive regulator of bone resorption) and GAS5 a regulator of miR 21 5p, which itself interact with PTX3 mRNA (a novel regulator ofbone homeostasis). Conclusions: Altogether, these data open a new reg ulatory mechanism of gene expression in bone homeostasisand could direct the development of future therapeutic approaches.

(Human Molecular Genetics,2017) has been published. Current study aimed to investigate the extent of placental eQTLs implicated in the programming of fetal development, postnatal metabolismand disease susceptibility. Materials and Methods: RNA sequencing and whole genome genotyping datasets of 40 placental samples fromREPROMETA cohort (SÃµber et al., 2015; Kasak et al., 2015) were used for the cis eQTL analysis in Matrix eQTL (goo.gl/wHPxxf). Selected eSNP eGenes pairs were vali dated by Taqman RT qPCR and tested for the association with birth parameters. The association testing utilized REPROMETA (n ,336), HAPPY PREGNANCY (n ,408) and ALSPAC (n ,7669) cohorts. Results: Analysis of cis eQTLs identi ï¬ed 199 (88 inde pendent) placental cis eSNPs (FDR <5%). Six identi ï¬ed eSNP eGenes pairs have been directly associated with blood metabolites, Parkinson âs and Alzheimer âs disease and colorectal cancer. Overall, 58/63 eGenes were locatedwithin 100kb of loci associated with in (auto)immunity, anthropometric parameters, blood parameters, neu ropsychiatric diseases. In the REPROMETA study, a sug gestive association was detected between the AA genotype of rs11678251 (ALPG c. 318 G>A) and reduced placental, newborn âs and infant âs weight, but this ï¬nding did not replicate in other cohorts.

31121,"Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, IsraelWhole genome sequencing (WGS) variant analysis and interpretation requires an exploration of non genic func tional genomic elements such as promoters and enhancers, involved in development and implicated in disease. The comprehensive identi ï¬cation of regulatory elements and their gene targets is a signi ï¬cant challenge. We created GeneHancer (PMID:28605766), a regulatory element database within the GeneCards Suite ( https://www.geneca rds.org/ ), with 250,000 enhancers and promoters. Informa tion is amalgamated from ENCODE, Ensembl, FANTOM5, VISTA, dbSUPER, EPDnew, UCNEbase and GTEx. GeneHancer creates a unique non redundant and compre hensive view of regulatory elements, including their target gene associations, transcription factor binding sites, tissue speciï¬city and super enhancer mapping. We recently focus on phenotype/disease annotation of such elements, based on variant trait mappings from the GWAS Catalog, and literature curated evidence from DiseaseEnhancer andNCBI Entrez Gene. GeneHancer is now used by a considerable fraction of GeneCards â4 million user base to annotate non coding variants, and was recently included asa native regulation track at the UCSC genome browser, where it is the only source for explicit regulatory regions and gene associations. GeneHancer provides an indispen sable augmentation for the GeneCards âNGS disease interpretation tools: VarElect, a phenotype interpreter, and TGex, a VCF to report analyzer (PMID:27357693), usedby major clinical sequencing centers. Non coding variants are mapped to regulatory regions, and then prioritized with respect to diseases and phenotype keywords via direct andtarget gene mediated links.

Possible genetic or epigenetic biomarker identi ï¬cation is important to have a proper management in case of IA. Material and Methods: Ethnically and geographically matched subject were selected and subjected to genomic DNA isolation from peripheral blood using phenol chloroform method. Genotyping was carried out by San gerâs dideoxy method. Various statistical and computational methods like chi square, LD analysis, Haploview were performed. Evaluation of gene expression for risk allele wascarried out using In silico approach by mining GTEx data. Functional relevance of the associated SNPs were further carried out by retrieving data from Ensembl and Haploregto identify possible mode of impact of SNP on the regula tion of the gene. Results: MTHFR rs1801131 (A1286C) present in C terminal regulatory domain, was found to be signi ï¬cantly associated with IA. Another variant MTRR rs10380 present near to FADH2 binding pocket, which is in an active site forthe co factor vit B12 was also found to be signi ï¬cantly associated. BHMT involves with the direct conversion of homocysteine (HCy) back to methionine with the help ofbetaine and choline, here SNP rs3733890 was associated with Aneurysm. GTEx data for the associated alleles do indicate altered expression pro ï¬le suggesting a possible accumulation of HCy. Conclusions: Risk alleles in one carbon metabolism genes are associated with IA indicating increased HCyaccumulation.

Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology of Russia, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Ischemic brain stroke is one of the most serious and socially signi ï¬cant diseases. The study ofregulatory RNAs in ischemia has exceptional importance for the development of new strategies for neuroprotection. The circular RNAs (circRNAs) have closed structure, predominantly brain speci ï¬c expression and remain highly promising targets of research. CircRNAs can act as miRNA sponges for protection of the encoding mRNA. The work isdevoted to the study of the circRNA functioning in the rat brain after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Materials and Methods: tMCAO model, magnetic resonance imaging, histological examination, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA Seq), real time RT PCR, bioinformatics. Results: Using RNA Seq 11,134 circRNAs were ana lysed in the subcortical structures of the rat brain. Werevealed 395 circRNAs that changed their expression (Fold change>1.5, padj<0.05) at 24h after tMCAO. They were encoded by glutamate receptor (Gria1, Grm3), catalytic(Adcy5, Ntrk2), transporter (Kcnd2, Kcnq2) and other genes associated mainly with neurotransmission signaling pathway. Bioinformatic analysis predicted circRNA miRNA mRNA network which may determine the neuro transmission signaling regulation for stroke. The largest number of competitive interactions with miRNAs wasfound between circRNAs of Marf1, Ppp4r4 and Plcb1 genes, as well as mRNAs of Stx1a and Ccnd1 genes that changed their expression after tMCAO. Conclusion: Genome wide circRNA pro ï¬ling reveals novel insight to the neurotransmission regulation in rat brain after cerebral ischemia. We assumed that circRNAs may bekey nodes of the regulation of the neurotransmission genetic response and therapeutic targets for stroke.

However, the mechanisms by which these molecules contribute to the pathogenesis of T1Dremain to be clari ï¬ed. Preliminary results of our group have demonstrated that the expression of several T1D associated lncRNAs ismodiï¬ed by diabetogenic stimuli, such as viral infections and pro in ï¬ammatory cytokines, in pancreatic Î²cells. Of special interest are the results obtained in the characteriza tion of Lnc13 , a lncRNA expressed and upregulated by viral dsRNA in Î²cells that harbors a SNP associated with T1D (rs917997). Overexpression of Lnc13 in human Î²cells led to an increase in STAT1/2 pathway activation that correlated with increased production of pro in ï¬ammatory chemokines. Interestingly, when the Lnc13 harboring the risk allele for T1D (rs917997*C) was transfected, the increase in STAT1/ 2 signaling was more pronounced than in cells transfectedwith the plasmid encoding the Lnc13 with the protection allele (rs917997*T). In addition, the effect of Lnc13 upre gulation on chemokine production was also allele speci ï¬c. Our studies have shown that intracellular PIC induces Lnc13 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, increasing STAT1/2 mRNA stability by promoting its interaction with a protein named PCBP2. In conclusion, our results show that Lnc13 participates in pancreatic Î²cell in ï¬ammation via regulation of the STAT1/ 2 signaling pathway, suggesting a functional effect of this lncRNA in T1D pathogenesis.

31125,"Paulo, Brazil Introduction: During Colonial Period, about four million Africans were brought to Brazil as slaves. Throughout this period, many runaway, abandoned and freed slaves foundedsmall isolated rural communities, the Quilombos . In the state of SÃ£o Paulo, most Quilombo remnants are located in the Vale do Ribeira region. Objective: To shed light on the admixture dynamics of 12 Quilombo communities in Vale do Ribeira, we used a genomics approach. Material and Methods: 665 individuals were genotyped with ~600K SNP array (Axiom Human Origins, Affyme trix), and analyzed to estimate ancestry and effectivepopulation sizes (Ne). Results: African, European and Native American ances tries contribute, respectively, 44%, 40%, and 16% forautosomes, 49%, 2%, and 49% for mtDNA and 32%, 63%, and 6% for the Y chromosome. This reveals directional mating involving European men with African and Nativewomen. We further dissected timing of admixture and ï¬uctuation in effective population sizes. Using ancestry estimates of Ne based on IBD, we found the smallest Ne ~7generations ago, coinciding with the origin of these com munities. We inferred that admixture between Africans and Europeans occurred with greatest intensity 13 generationsago (Â± 8 18), prior to the origin of these Quilombos. However, admixture with Native Americans occurred 7 generations ago (Â±3 12). Conclusion: TheQuilombo populations have a history of directional mating between European men with African and Native women, involving two main periods of admixture,13 (involving Africans and Europeans) and 7 (involving Native Americans) generations ago.

One of the isolated communities is the Gali Änik population. It is one of the oldest villages in Macedonia, founded by the Slavic ethnic group called Mijaks around the 10thcentury. Among the individuals of Gali Änik population, the nephropathy was detected with clinical manifestationslinked to the Alport syndrome. Materials and Methods: In total, 111 saliva samples were collected from Macedonian individuals with paternaland/or maternal origin from the Gali Änik village. For the purpose of population analysis, 44 unrelated male samples were obtained from the dataset. A total of 16 Y chromosome biallelic markers and 17 Y STR markers were analysed using a high resolution melt analysis and capillary fragment analysis. For detection of the COL4A3,COL4A4, and COL4A5 mutations, custom made NGS panel was used. Results and Conclusions: Analysis revealed two muta tions, both affecting autosomal chromosome 2. First muta tion was detected in exon 38 of the COL4A3 gene, resulting in an in frame deletion of three amino acids and the secondmutation in exon 13 of the COL4A4 gene, resulting in a glycine substitution within Gly X Y triple helical domain. Segregation analysis revealed that the two mutations wereinherited together on the same chromosome, like in cis following digenic autosomal inheritance pattern. Population analysis of the Gali Änik population showed a high level of genetic homogeneity within Gali Änik population and strong genetic af ï¬liations of Gali Änik population with West Slavic populations, especially the Polish population.

We describe here the ï¬rst stage of a project to characterize genetic variation across Asian populations with the ultimate goal of providing a rich resource for precisionmedicine. Materials and Methods: In this pilot phase we focused on population isolates to capture a broad swath of genetic diversity across the continent. We have characterized the genomes of 1,739 individuals, including 1,236 newly sequenced high coverage whole genomes, representing 64 countries and more than 200 ethnic groups. Results: We identi ï¬ed 63 million SNPs, 29 million of which have not been previously described, and nearly 4 million indels. The underlying samples have GIS coordi nates indicating their origin, allowing variant frequencies to be displayed geographically.

Because heritability of birth timing has a strong dominant compo nent, we hypothesized that genes involved in parturition would display higher recessive effects, driving estimatedautozygosity to shorten gestational duration. We investigated runs of homozygosity (ROH) in relation to spontaneous delivery in 13000 family trios. We estimated maternal, fetal and paternal autozygosity as the percentage of autosomal SNP mappable distance cov ered by ROH (F ROH) and mapped ROHs to protein coding genes by the percentage of overlapping length between ROH and gene coordinates (ROH gene). We used survival analysis to estimate the effect of F ROHand ROH geneon time to spontaneous delivery in ~9000 (discovery) and ~4000 (replication) triads of Norwegian ancestry from the MoBa cohort. While we observed a correlation between parental and fetal F ROH (R,0.14), the correlation was not detected between maternal and paternal F ROH(R,0.06). Evidence from estimated autozygosity analysis suggests an effect of maternal F ROH on spontaneous delivery risk (HR, 1.008; 95%CI, 1.003 1.014), despite failing the replication attempt(1.003; 0.994 1.011). Consistent with our hypothesis, maternal ROH gene mapping revealed six protein coding genes associated with higher spontaneous delivery risk(pvalue<7.3x10 6, no replication) and a right skewness of z scores (>55% of genes increased spontaneous delivery risk; Ï2pvalue<2.2x10 16). Estimated autozygosity highlights the role of maternal genome on, and the dominant component of gestational duration.

31129,"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden Introduction: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identi ï¬ed associations between thousands of geneticvariants and human traits. However, these associations only explain a limited fraction of the heritability of most traits. Additionally, the contribution of rare variants is still largely unknown, one reason being that they usually are not tagged by common tagSNPs used in GWAS. A powerful resource for identifying trait associated variants is by whole genomesequencing (WGS) in cohorts comprised of families or individuals from a limited geographical area. Materials and Methods: GWAS were performed in a kinship structured population based cohort from northern Sweden (N ,1021) with WGS data. Genetic associations were tested for 85 in ï¬ammatory biomarker proteins mea sured in blood plasma samples. Results: We identi ï¬ed 44 independent associations, that comprised 5813 single nucleotide variant protein associa tions for 42 in ï¬ammatory markers. Six of the lead variants were low frequency variants (MAF<5%), and one associa tion with a rare variant (MAF<1%) was identi ï¬ed. Here, we report 19 novel regions as well as 25 loci that were not detected in the same cohort in analyses on genotyped and imputed SNPs. Conclusions: Even in a GWA approach, we gain power and precision by using WGS data. This is suggestive of a more accurate determination of genotypes using WGScompared to imputations. However, the limited sample size did not allow for identifying further associations with rare variants.

This duplication is copy number variant and includes 3 to 8 copies of BOLA2 , which encodes a protein involved in the maturation of iron sulfur cytosolic proteins. To investigate the potential human advantage of BOLA2 duplication, we assessed hematological traits and iron related phenotypes of 379385 controls, 89 16p11.2 deletion and 56 duplication carriers in the UKBiobank, as deletion and duplication individuals have, respectively, less andmore copies of BOLA2 than controls. We found that 16p11.2 deletion is strongly associated with anemia (18/89 carriers, 20%, P,3e 10), particularly iron de ï¬ciency ane mia. To gauge whether this phenotype was due to BOLA2 , we collected clinical information of 16p11.2 deletioncarriers with varying numbers of BOLA2 copies, and found an association between low BOLA2 dosage and anemia (P,1e 4). In particular, 8 out of 15 (53%) individuals with three copies needed iron supplementation and/or were anemic. To con ï¬rm our ï¬ndings, we analyzed hematolo gical traits and plasma iron level in mouse models carryingthe 16p11.2 orthologous deletion and, more speci ï¬cally, Bola2 +/ andBola2 / mice. Agreeing with human data, all models showed signi ï¬cantly lower blood iron and hemo globin levels and smaller red blood cells than wild type littermates, with a linear relation with Bola2 dosage when comparing Bola2+/+,Bola2+/ andBola2 / mice. Our results show that BOLA2 participates in iron home ostasis and a lower dosage is associated with anemia. These data highlight a potential adaptive role of the human speciï¬c expansion of BOLA2 in improving iron metabolism. G. Giannuzzi: None. E. Porcu: None. G. Willemin: None. X. Nuttle: None. D.

To better understand the contributions of humangenetic variation to chronic in ï¬ammation, we performed genome wide association studies of plasma levels of four inï¬ammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL 1 Î², IL 6 and TNF Î±) using data collected in the context of the CoLaus study, a large population based cohort including >5,000 individuals in Lausanne, Switzerland. Using general linear models, wesearched for associations between 9 million genetic variants and the natural log transformed plasma levels of the four biomarkers. We identi ï¬ed multiple genome wide signi ï¬cant associations (p<1.25E 8) with CRP levels at 5 previously identi ï¬ed genomic loci, encompassing the genes APOE (p,2.01E 16), CRP (p,3.11E 12), HNF1A (p,1.83E 11), IL6R (p,2.04E 09) and LEPR (p,3.95E 09). Interestingly, we observed that people carrying the ApoE4 genotype, known as the leading genetic risk factor for Alzheimer âs disease, have lower CRP levels, suggesting that the modulating role of APOE variants in Alzheimer âs patho genesis is not mediated through chronic in ï¬ammation. On the other hand, we did not identify any genome wide signiï¬cant association with IL 1 Î², IL 6 and TNF Î±levels after correction for multiple testing, which suggest thatthese cytokines are less tightly genetically controlled than CRP and that common genetic variants of large effect do not play a major role in their regulation.

SES is a major determinant of health and related outcomes. Lower SES confers increased risk for stroke, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity. Early life adversity produces lasting and deleterious effects on devel opmental outcome. The correlation of genetic variants and SES is only beginning to be understood. Results: We curated an anonymised database of results from over 17,000 postnatal clinical array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) performed at the Manche ster Centre for Genomic Medicine between 2010 and 2017.From this database we identi ï¬ed 473 unique cases of pathogenic or likely pathogenic autosomal copy number variants (CNVs) with complete inheritance status (218 caseswith inherited and 255 cases with de novo CNVs) and postcode information. We obtained indices of deprivation associated with each of these postcodes. We found thatindividuals with inherited pathogenic/likely pathogenic CNVs were signi ï¬cantly more likely to be living in areas of higher deprivation when compared to individuals with denovo CNVs (p x2 trend,2.1x10 6) or with the general popu lation of North West England (p x2 trend,4.3x10 14). Conclusions: We show that inheritance of pathogenic CNVs and lower SES are correlated. Our results demon strate the need to quantify the secondary social and medicalconsequences of lower SES of individuals with inherited CNVs. These results have important implications for plan ning of medical and social services and provide unique insights into determinants of SES. G. J. Burghel: None. U. Khan: None. W. Lin: None. W.

We aimed to (1) investigate and (2) validatewhether CMA children carry a highe r genetic susceptibility for other immunological hypersen sitivity disorders using poly genic risk score analysis (PRS) and prospective phenotypicdata. Twenty two CMA patien ts of the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study and 307 reference subjects were genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Differen tially genetic susceptibility wa s estimated using PRS, based on multiple P value thresholds for SNP inclusion of previously reported genome wide associa tion studies (GWAS) on asthma, autism spectrum disorder, atopic dermatitis, in ï¬ammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid a rthritis. These associations were validated with prospective data outcomes during a six year follow up in 19 patients. We observed robust and signiï¬cantly higher PRSs of asthma in CMA children compared to the reference set. Association analyses usingthe prospective data indicated signi ï¬cant higher PRSs in former CMA patients suffering from asthma and related traits. Our results suggest a shared genetic etiology between CMA and asthma and a considerable predictive sensitivity potential for subsequent onset of asthma which indicates a potential use for early clinical asthma intervention programs.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of AMPD1 (c.133C>T, p. Gln45Ter, rs17602729) and CKM (c.*800A>G, rs8111989) poly morphisms on physical performance of Lithuanian elite athletes. Materials and Methods: The study involved 150 Lithuanian athletes (60 females, 90 males; strati ï¬ed into: endurance oriented (n ,63), sprint/power oriented (n ,65), mixed (n ,22) groups) and 150 controls (60 females, 90 males, healthy unrelated non athletes). Anthropometric measurements and muscle strength (grip strength, short term explosive muscle power (STEMP), anaerobic alacticmuscle power (AAMP)), and maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max) were measured. Genotyping was performed by RT PCR (for CKM polymorphism) and RFLP restriction enzyme digestion (for AMPD1 ). Results: The phenotypic measurements were signi ï¬cantly different and speci ï¬c to each sports groups (p<0,05). The frequencies of the CKM genotypes were signi ï¬cantly dif ferent between the male and female sprint/power oriented athletes (AA/AG/GG: 37.8/54.1/8.1% vs50.0/25.0/25.0%, p,0.035). CKM AA and AG genotyped athletes had sig niï¬cantly higher STEMP than GG genotyped athletes (p,0.005). AMPD1 CC genotyped endurance oriented males athletes had signi ï¬cantly lower values of AAMP than the heterozygous athletes (p ,0.04). Moreover, AMPD1 CC genotyped endurance oriented female had signiï¬cantly higher VO 2max than heterozygous female (p,0.01). Conclusions: CKM and AMPD1 genetic variants have different effect on Lithuanian male and female physical capacity.

An increasing number of genetic studies have outlined the association between host genetic variations and dengueseverity. Mannose binding lectin acts in ï¬rst line response to dengue virus (DENV). However, data regarding the association between MBL2 gene and dengue severity are still controversial. Materials and Methods: We have investigated the association between 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) at MBL2 gene (rs7095891, rs1800450, rs1800451, rs4935047, rs930509, rs2120131, rs2099902) and dengue severity in children from Rio de Janeiro. The case group(N,87) included children with severe disease (DSS) and a control group (N ,197) was selected among neighbors and cases âhousehold members matched by age. Statistical analyses were performed using conditional logistic regres sion models. Proportions of European, African and Native American ancestries were also determined to adjust forconfounding. Results: No associations were observed in single SNP analysis. However, when MBL2 SNPs were combined in haplotypes, the allele rs7095891G/rs1800450C/rs1800451C/ rs4935047A/rs930509G/rs2120131G/rs2099902C was sig niï¬cantly associated with risk of severe dengue (OR ,4.02; 95%CI:1.23 13.09; p ,0.02) as compared to the most frequent haplotype (A/C/C/A/G/T/T). A second haplotype carrying rs4935047G and rs7095891G alleles was also associated torisk (OR ,1.91; 95%CI:1.02 3.6; p ,0.04). Conclusion: MBL2 haplotypes are associated to dengue severity in Brazilian children even after adjustment forgenetic ancestry. These results reinforce the role of mannose binding lectin in immune response to DENV and suggest that variations at MBL2 gene may help predict disease course. Financial support: CNPq, CAPES. A. M.M.

31139,"Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany Background: Disease risk varies signi ï¬cantly between ethnicities, however, it is unknown if these observations are a consequence of environmental or genetic factors. Investigating ethnic differences within the human proteome may shed light on the impact of ancestry on health and disease. Methods: Admixture mapping was used to explore the impact of ancestry on a panel of 237 cardiometabolic bio markers in 2,216 Latin American participants within theORIGIN trial. We developed a variance component model to determine the proportion of variance explained by local ancestral differences, and applied this model in ORIGIN. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify genetic loci affecting biomarker variability between ethnicities. Results: Variance component analysis revealed 5% of biomarkers to have a signi ï¬cant effect of ancestry, including C peptide and apolipoprotein E. We also identi ï¬ed 46 local ancestry associations across 40 biomarkers. Independentanalyses revealed 34 of these regions were associated at genome wide signi ï¬cance with their respective biomarker in either ORIGIN Europeans (n ,1,931) or Latins. Finally, we found that a genetic risk score in Latins based on ancestral differences of C peptide levels, was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (OR ,4.47 per SD, 95% CI 1.70 to 11.76, p ,0.002) and measures of insulin resistance. Discussion: Our results demonstrate the importance of ancestry on biomarker levels, suggesting some of theobserved differences in disease prevalence likely has a biological basis, and that use of reference intervals should be tailored to ancestry. Speci ï¬cally, our results suggest a role of ancestry in insulin metabolism and diabetes risk. Supported by Sano ï¬and CIHR. J. Sjaarda: A. Employment (full or part time); Signi ï¬cant; CHUV. H.

The main goal for this study wasto investigate the effect of increasing maternal age (the result of the known and ongoing demographic change in the Czech Republic) on the population incidence of Down syndrome. Methods: Data were obtained from the of ï¬cial National Registry of Congenital Anomalies of the Czech Republic. We evaluated the incidence of Down syndrome (ICD 10code Q90) in the livebirths and in the prenatally diagnosed cases (time period 1994 2017). We were also investigating other related variables (like maternal age, diagnostic/screening methods). The registration process is country wide and compulsory by national law. Results: The overall incidence of Down syndrome in livebirths decreased from 7.79 in 1994 (relative incidences per 10.000 live births) to 3.48 in 2017 (p<0.05). The inci dence of prenatally diagnosed (and electively terminated)cases increased rapidly from 5.35 in 1994 to 25.53 in 2017 (p<0.05). The average maternal age increased from 22.9 in 1994 to 30.2 in 2017. Discussion: The overall incidence of Down syndrome in the Czech Republic is increasing (the incidence is increas ing in prenatally diagnosed and terminated cases, the inci dence in births is decreasing). We identi ï¬ed two main reasons: 1) gradual implementation of combined screening1750of the ï¬rst trimester; 2) rapidly increasing maternal age in the Czech Republic during the last 30 years.

31141,"1Institut of Biophysics, Linz, Austria,2Institut of Integrative Biology, Liverpool, United Kingdom Introduction: The repair of DNA lesions, mismatches or double strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis plays a critical role for maintaining genome stability and integrity. Meiotic recombination is initiated via programmed DSBs inhotspots, which are repaired as crossovers (COs) or non crossovers (NCOs). Regions of heteroduplex DNA, formed during strand invasion in DSB repair, can lead totransmission biases. Of particular interest is this bias in terms of repeat instability, such as microsatellites, which are often linked to genetic disorders. Unfortunately, theassociation between meiotic recombination and repeat instability is not well understood. Method: Therefore, thousands of single COs and NCOs collected via pooled sperm typing in nine different donors were analyzed for transmission biases of two different poly A repeats: a 6A/7A and a 9A/19A. Results: Heterologies between heterozygous poly As strongly in ï¬uenced the transmission: an insertion bias forthe short heterology (6A/7A) was observed in contrast to the deletion bias for the long heterology (9A/19A). One donor was of particular interest, showing in addition 12x more complex COs (unconverted SNPs between converted ones). Whole Exome sequencing of this donor showed a missense mutation c.1196A>G at XRCC1 involved in base excision repair and a synonymous mutation c.354T>C at ERCC1 involved in nucleotide excision repair. Discussion: This indicates that mismatch repair has a major impact in the transmission of microsatellites during meiotic recombination and that mutations in repair genes can lead to aberrant recombination products and a massiveincrease in complex events.

Statistical analyses were undertaken with the R package on frequencies of ï¬ltered variants from the present study biallelic autosomal single nucleotide variants and gnomAD genome data. GnomAD genome data were chosen for comparison, since our results include many non codingvariants and furthermore, gnomAD exome includes exomes of 1335 Bulgarians out of 7718 non Finish Europeans (NFE).

Thegreatest differences between Bulgarians/Fins (populations marking the northwest/southeast genetic gradient of Eur ope) are mostly due to variants in genes of the immunesystem; lipid, protein and carbohydrate metabolism; cell cycle and cell cell communication.

31143,"Segmental duplications in the human genome are enriched for genes involved in immunity and host defence. Characterisation of sequence variation within these regions using high throughput sequencing can be challenging due toextensive copy number variation, gene conversion, and mismapping of sequence reads to alternative paralogues. Fc gamma Receptors (Fc Î³Rs) are a family of glycoproteins that bind to the Fc portion of the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mediate the response of effector cells to immune complexes. The genes encoding the low af ï¬nity Fc Î³Rs (FCGR2A ,FCGR2B ,FCGR2C ,FCGR3A , and FCGR3B ) are located in an 82.5 âkb segmental tandem duplication on chromosome 1q23.3 and characterized by extensive copynumber and sequence variation and high sequence similar ity. There is a 92% 96% sequence homology among FCGR2A ,FCGR2B andFCGR2C genes. FCGR2B encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIb (Fc Î³RIIb) (CD32B), the only inhibitory Fc Î³R that leads to the downregulation of B cell activation and immunoglobulin production. Genomewideassociation studies have highlighted variants in FCGR2B associated with disease phenotypes, but the context andconsequence of these variants within the larger landscape of variation of this region remains unclear. Here, we assay FCGR2B sequence variation using targeted paralogue speci ï¬c high throughput sequencing, and place this variation in the context of recently identi ï¬ed gene conver sion variants, expression variation of FCGR2B , and GWAS association signals.

Materials and Methods: 90,793 children from the Karachay Cherkess Republic (KChR) were examined. 121 patients from 109 families from the KChR were included in the clinical, molecular, epidemiological analysis. Geneticepidemiological, clinical, paraclinical, molecular genetic, and statistical methods were used in the work. Results: The total prevalence of NSHOP in child popu lation of KChR appeared to be 1:671 children. 45 clinical and genetic forms were revealed, frequent of which are congenital ptosis (1:11342), microphthalmia (1:22685),aniridia (1:30246), congenital cataract (1:5671), retinal pathology (1:22685), optic nerve pathology (1:11342). DNA diagnosis revealed a novel nucleotide variants in thePAX6 gene: c.607C>T, (p. Arg203Ter), c.747_750del (p. Pro250Lysfs*21) associated with congenital aniridia; in the CHST6 gene: c.610C>T (p. Pro204Ser) and c.1124delT (p. Val375Glyfs*6) associated with corneal dystrophy; as well as in the gene PRPF8 gene: c.428A>G, (p. Gln143Arg) associated with retinal pathology. Conclusions: Occurrence of NSHOP in child population of KChR was 1:671. Congenital malformations and1752pathology of the posterior segment of the eye are prevalent in the structure of pediatric disorders spectrum. DNA diagnosis revealed several novel variants in the genes associated with NSHOP. Supported by RFBR grant â18 015 00090. V. V. Kadyshev: None. A. V. Marakhonov: None. T. A. Vasilyeva: None. S. I.

However, the vast majority of these studies use datasets of predominantlyEuropean ancestry. It has generally been thought that complex trait genetic architecture should be transferable across populations of different ancestries, but recent workhas shown a number of differences between ethnic groups, including heterogeneity in both the identi ï¬ed causal variants and estimated effect sizes. Here, we reveal further evidencethat complex trait genetic architecture is fundamentally different between human ethnic groups by jointly lever aging pathway and epistasis analysis. Under the assumption that a given complex trait may have differential polygenic architectures across human ancestries, we hypothesize that human populations may also be enri ched for differences in epistatic effects. However, since polygenic traits tend to have smaller GWA effect sizes, combining variants via pathway analysis may allow us tobetter reveal these signals. To accomplish this, we build on a recently published method for identifying marginal epis tasis (MAPIT), moving from testing single variants totesting groups of variants for nonlinear association with a trait of interest. We apply our new method to multiple ancestries present in the UK Biobank and explore many pathway related interaction models. Using morphometric traits we ï¬ndevidence for differential architecture among African, Indian, and British individuals. We also ï¬nd evidence that these associations contain heterogeneous signals for epistatic effects. Lastly, we ï¬nd preliminary evidence that complex trait regulatory architecture may be enriched for epistatic interactions. M. C. Turchin: None. I. Tung: None. L. Crawford: None. S.

Developing a powerful tool for early detection of high risk individuals would allow postponing or even preventing T2D. Since genetic markers are ï¬xed for life, they have high potential for early detection. Therefore, it is important to ï¬nd the optimal genetic prediction method. Our aim is to test the performance of the recently developeddoubly weighted genetic risk score (dwGRS) for incident T2D in two European cohorts. Materials and Methods: Data from Lifelines (n,12,027) and the Estonian Biobank (n ,41,107) were used. The dwGRS for T2D uses an additional weight based on the probability for the SNP to belong to the top 1,000associated ones thus correcting for the Winner âs curse bias. The additional value of dwGRS to the incident T2D pre diction model was tested using survival analyses on top ofpredictors from the FINDRISC model. Hazard ratios and corresponding 95% con ï¬dence intervals (CI) were calcu lated. The net reclassi ï¬cation index was used to investigate the value of dwGRS. Results: Preliminary results in Lifelines show that every standard deviation higher dwGRS increased the risk forT2D by 1.25 (95%CI 1.10 â1.44) compared to 1.20 (95%CI 1.05â1.37) for the traditional GRS. Similar analyses will be applied in the Estonian Biobank. Conclusion: The dwGRS has a signi ï¬cant additional value to the prediction of incident T2D. Implementation of such risk scores in personalized risk prediction could lead toearly detection of high risk individuals, resulting in better targeted preventive measures.

The Cx26 expresses not only in the inner ear but also in the skin epidermis and other tissues. The high carrier frequencyof the GJB2 mutations in many ethnic populations may be explained by a heterozygous advantage of the GJB2 mutations carriers due to their thicker epidermal layer thatmay provide a protective mechanism against pathogen invasion and hostile environment. We analyzed (by skin ultrasonography) the epidermis thickness in 152 Yakutindividuals with different GJB2 genotypes ([Wt];[Wt], [Wt];[Mut], [Mut];[Mut]) for mutation c. 23 +1G>A (Mut) that was found with extremely high carrier frequency(10.3%) in the indigenous Yakut population of Eastern Siberia. Individuals who were homozygous (genotype [Mut];[Mut]) and heterozygous (genotype [Wt];[Mut]) forc. 23+1G>A have the thicker epidermal layer (0.245 mm and 0.269 mm, respectively) compared with individuals with genotype [Wt];[Wt] (0.193 mm) (p<0.05). These datamay support the hypothesis about the selective advantage of theGJB2 mutant alleles carriers and partly explain the extremely high carrier frequency of the c. 23 +1G>A mutation in Yakut population in Eastern Siberia.

While its extremes, hypo and hypertelorism, have been linked to genetic disorders, little is known about the genetic determinants ofinterocular distance within the general population. We aimed to study the heritability and perform a genome wide association study (GWAS) of telorism. Methods: Telorism was de ï¬ned as the distance between the eyeball center of gravity identi ï¬ed on cranial MRI images. First, we used a population based and a family based cohort studies to estimate the narrow sense herit ability (h 2) and broad sense heritability (H2). Second, we performed a GWAS using HRC imputed genotypes. Mod els included adjustment for age, sex, height and head size. Results: Heritability of telorism ranged between h 2,31% and H2,74% in the fully adjusted model (Table1). GWAS of telorism identi ï¬ed an intronic genetic variant on chro mosome 15 (rs62357458, MAF ,0.19, P value ,5.00E 08). Conclusion: Telorism is a heritable polygenic trait. We identi ï¬ed an intronic variant on chromosome 15 that was signiï¬cantly associated with telorism. Replication is ongo ing in ~20,000 individuals, with subsequent genetic corre lation and enrichment analyses planned next.

We propose a computational strategy to discover genetic variants affecting the relative expression ofalternative 3' untranslated region (UTR) isoforms, generated through alternative polyadenylation (APA), a post transcriptional regulatory mechanism known to haverelevant functional consequences. Material and Methods: We analyzed whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) data that wereobtained for 373 European individuals (GEUVADIS data set). RNA Seq data were used, together with an annotation of alternative 3 âUTR isoforms, to compute the expression ratio between the short and long isoform (m/M value) of each gene in each individual. Then, the association betweenthe m/M values of a gene and the genotype of the indivi duals for each in cis genetic variant was evaluated by linear regression. Results: We identi ï¬ed 2,530 genes with alternative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs) and we subsequently performed a deep investigation of the possiblemechanisms of action of these variants. In addition, we observed that apaQTLs are signi ï¬cantly enriched in GWAS hits, in particular those associated to immune related andneurological disorders. Conclusions: Our results suggest that genetic variants have a widespread effect on the relative expression ofalternative 3 âUTR isoforms in human. In addition, they point to an important role for genetically determined APA in affecting predisposition to complex diseases and suggestnew ways to extract functional information from GWAS data. E.

We further investi gate if associated lead SNPs have a signi ï¬cantly larger effect for one disease compared to the other diseases, to highlight possible disease speci ï¬c effects. Results: We identi ï¬ed 141 loci, of which 41 are novel, to be associated (P â¤3x10 8) with asthma, hay fever or eczema, analysed separately or as combined phenotypes. The largest number of loci were associated with the combined pheno type (asthma/hay fever/eczema).

31151,"Centre for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, Amsterdam, Netherlands Introduction: The phenotypic correlation between human intelligence and brain volume (BV) is considerable ( râ0.40) and has been shown to be due to shared genetic factors. Large scale GWAS for these traits have identi ï¬ed many novel loci and genes that explain their genetic architecture. However, it is unknown which shared loci and genes explain the genetic overlap between these traits. Materials and Methods: To further examine the nature of this correlation, we present genomic analyses of the genetic overlap between BV and intelligence using genome wide association study (GWAS) results. We conducted a GWAS meta analysis of a collated dataset on measurements of BV (N ,54,407), followed by extensive functional annotation and gene mapping, and study of the overlap with GWAS results of intelligence (N ,269,867) performed by our group. Results: GWAS meta analysis identi ï¬ed 35 genomic loci, 362 genes and 23 biological pathways for BV. We estimated the genetic correlation between BV and intelli gence of. r g,0.24. This overlap is driven by physical overlap in 5 genomic loci. By using several gene mapping strategies (including FUMA), we observed 67 overlappinggenes for both traits. Of these, several are involved in cell cycle regulation ( ERBB3 ,USP19 ), neuron morphology (INA), or genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders (MAPT ). We highlight cortical areas of the brain where these genes are expressed. Conclusions: These results provide new information on the genetics of BV and insight into the biology of its shared genetic aetiology with intelligence. These results illustrate how large scale GWAS and subsequent gene mapping aidin understanding the genetic cross section between see mingly distinct traits. P. Jansen: None. M. Nagel: None. T.

Genomic data obtained from consanguineous and bottle necked populations, as found in the Middle East, areparticularly useful for HLOF analyses, as they are enriched in homozygous variants. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing data from 2663 Middle Eastern individuals were queried for HLOF variants. Stop gain, high quality frameshift, and splice site variants, with a read depth of 15X or greater incanonical transcripts, were included. No ï¬lter was placed on minor allele frequency. Results: Querying HLOF variants in 2663 exomes (2030 affected, 633 healthy) yielded 107,393 variants, represent ing 1155 unique variants in 952 genes. These included 378 stop gain, 520 frameshift, and 257 splice site variants. An average of 40.33 HLOF variants were identi ï¬ed per exome. 413/952 (43.4%) of the unique genes identi ï¬ed in this study were previously reported as human KO genes. Rare HLOF variants in affected individuals included pre viously published disease associated genes, such as WDR16 ,SNX10 ,PLD1 ,CARD11 , and several candidate disease genes. Conclusion: Rare HLOF variants in affected individuals are potentially disease causing variants, whereas HLOFvariants in healthy individuals may have bene ï¬cial effects and thus are potential drug discovery targets. Reassuringly, only 43.4% of the genes identi ï¬ed in this study overlap with previously reported human KO genes, underscoring the potential utility of the current research. H. Mor Shaked: None. D.

From this curateddataset, a high con ï¬dence (HC) HLA (classical eight genes: A,B,C,DPA1 ,DPB1 ,DQA1 ,DQB1 ,DRB1 ) resource was constructed for the use of the wider research community. Materials and Methods: A combination of software (HLA VBSeq, HLAscan, OptiType, SNP2HLA) was usedto call HLA alleles from BAM ï¬les, followed by con cordance to determine the ï¬nal HC set (minimum of n 1 software calls the same four digit allele). The population frequency of HC alleles was compared to published Swedish lab typed values where available, and eight gene haplotypes contrasted to Caucasian cohorts. Results: The complete set of classical eight HC alleles were typed in 608 samples, improved to 926 when con sidering only Class I alleles ( A,B,C). This was due to a combination of software and IMGT/HLA availability. Comparison with the lab typed cohort showed the HC alleles re ï¬ected expected values (r 2,0.81 0.99, ï¬ve genes), with minor differences perhaps due to reference versions. Four of the top ï¬ve haplotypes found in the HC set were also top ranked in the Caucasian cohorts.

Availability of comprehensive ancestral information is especially valuable for detectingremote relationships in otherwise disconnected families. We have implemented and assessed FamAgg, an R package for detecting related individuals affected by some trait in largepedigrees. We furthermore demonstrate its capabilities by examining traits in the context of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. Materials and Methods: In order to assess the ability to correctly detect FA, we de ï¬ne families affected by a Mendelian trait (cases) and challenge ï¬ve different FA methods to identify these families within a large set of pedigrees with randomly chosen affected individuals (con trols). Method performance evaluation is based on varyingtrait prevalence and penetrance, and on the number of affected generations within the case families. The CHRIS study is a population based study with pedigree data on>10,000 participants carried out in an alpine valley in theNorth of Italy. Here, participants have been investigated for FA for ~80 traits. Results and Conclusions: Tests performed equally well for cases with low prevalence, high penetrance and many generations of affected individuals. We were able to identify tests with superior performance under more challengingconditions (e.g. 6.25% trait prevalence and 60% penetrance in three generations of affected individuals) and give recommendations on test usage and interpretation.

Founder population size, demographic changes like multiple bottle necks or rapid expansion can lead to variation in recombination rates across different populations like in the case of Finland. Previous research has shown populationspeciï¬c settings has a signi ï¬cant effect on downstream population genomic analysis like haplotype phasing, genotype imputation and association. Materials and Methods: Here, we examined high resolution recombination rate variation at 10 and 50kb scales using deep whole genome sequences (20 30X cov erage) of 55 trios all over from Finland. We then tested the downstream effects of the population speci ï¬c effective population sizes and lower recombination rates in statisticalphasing, genotype imputation and disease association mapping in Finns in comparison with non Finnish Europeans. Results: Population speci ï¬c effective population sizes were found to have no effect in haplotype phasing (switch1758error rates ~ 2%) and average imputation concordances (97 98%). Similarly, we found no effect of population speci ï¬c recombination maps in phasing with comparable switch error rates (SER) across all autosomes. Downstream popu lation genetic analyses depend on population speci ï¬c con texts like appropriate reference panels and their sample sizebut not on recombination maps or effective population sizes.

However, most of these variants lay in intronic or intragenic regions and do not provide a clear target gene. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)studies and transcription wide association analyses (TWAS) may contribute to explain the observed associations between genetic regions and complex diseases such asCrohn âs disease and ulcerative colitis. In this study, we conducted a summary based TWAS for In ï¬ammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) risk using RNA seq data form alargest set of colon tissue biopsies from healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: Colon tissue biopsies were obtained from 191 healthy volunteers at colonoscopy. Genetic predictive models for the expression of ~6,000 genes were obtained through penalized elastic net models using PredXcan software. Subsequently, summary TWASwas performed combining genetic prediction models andgenome wide association results for IBD risk published by the International IBD Genetics Consortium. Results: TWAS analysis identi ï¬ed one novel IBD locus association (INPP5E gene at 9q34.3 region; P ,1.2x10 19) and eleven new candidate genes in known GWAS loci (P<1x10 8).

For each pair of individuals, this allows estimates of both theirkinship coef ï¬cient Ïand their probability Ïof sharing two alleles Identical By Descent. Estimating relatedness is an important step for many genetic study designs. For instance,estimates of ÏandÏare necessary to assess the respective roles of additive and non additive genetic components in the study of complex traits. However, when dealing withlow depth sequencing or imputation data, individual level genotypes cannot be con ï¬dently called. To ignore such uncertainty is known to result in biased computations. Accordingly, methods have recently been developed to estimate kinship from uncertain genotypes. Here, we make an extension to include non additive variance by derivingorthogonal genetic components from uncertain genotype data and proposing new estimators for both the coef ï¬cients ÏandÏ. By construction, our estimators are robust to departures from Hardy Weinberg principles, and thus could be of interest for samples that present inbreeding orAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1759population structure. For an additional application, the orthogonality of the components allows for association testing of non additive genetic effects without having to call genotypes. We have simulated low depth genetic data for a sample of individuals with extensive relatedness by using the complex pedigree of the known genetic isolates ofCilento. Though this simulation, we explore the behaviour of our estimators, demonstrate their properties, and show potential advantages over alternative methods. A. F. Herzig: None. M. Ciullo: None. A. L.

The GnomAD_exome database includes 1335 Bulgarian exomes and a series of international research studies involve Bulgarian exomes andgenomes. In this study we further characterize genomic variations in centenarians, focusing on variants in genes related to telomere maintenance. Telomeres are complexDNA protein structures that form protective caps at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes. They prevent chromosome degradation and form part of cellular mechanisms respon sible for maintaining genomic integrity and cell longevity. Materials and Methods: Case control WES pool ana lysis of 32 centenarians and 61 young healthy controls andWGS was performed in 16 centenarians. Results: After quality ï¬ltering a total of 610 variants were found in 82 genes known to be involved in regulation oftelomere maintenance. 22 variants were found to be more prevalent in Bulgarian centenarians than in controls and for one of them (rs75803132) the P value was below 5.0 Ñ10 8 (MAF G ,0,267 in BG centenarians versus MAF G ,0,07 in controls). The variant rs75803132 (NM_003668.3:c.661 63A>G) in intron 8 of the gene MAPKAPK5 has been observed at MAF 0,076 (GnomAD_genome NFE) and seems to be enriched in Bulgarian centenarians.

31160,"Department of Genetics, University Medical Centre Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, Groningen,Netherlands Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a widely used method to identify causality from genetic data, but its application to gene expression traits is challenging. Widespread pleiotropy and linkage between expression quantitative loci (eQTL)often result in violations of the assumptions behind MR. In simulations, existing MR methods demonstrate uncalibrated false positive rates (FPR) or low power to detect causality. Here, we introduce MR link, a novel two sample MR method that incorporates variants in linkage disequilibrium with conditionally independent (CI) eQTL, to correct forlinkage and unobserved pleiotropy. In simulations, MR link has consistently calibrated FPR (median: 0.05) and higher power over other tested methods (max: 0.96), even whenonly a single CI eQTL variant is detectable. We have now applied MR link to LDL cholesterol (LDL C) measurements, joined to eQTL datasets derived fromblood (2), liver, and coronary artery tissue. This identi ï¬ed 25 genes causal to LDL C, including the known and vali dated SORT1 transcript, along with genes that were missed by genome wide association studies on lipids but none theless validated in vivo. For example, MR link implicates NEGR1 , involved in the lipid storage disorder Nieman Pick disease as well as DEPP1 expression, lowering insulin levels, which consequently affects lipids. Beside genes with known biological function, MR link identi ï¬ed 15 novel genes causal to LDL C levels, interesting candidates for follow up experiments.1760These results demonstrate that MR link successfully identi ï¬es known causal relationships between gene expression and complex traits while also revealing novel causal genes that may further improve our understanding of the etiology of complex traits from observational data.

It is also unclear if any such causal effects differ between men and women. Materials and Methods: We constructed sex speci ï¬c genetic risk scores for the obesity traits: body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324 and 338 genetic variants, respectively. Using Mendelian randomization, we investigated for asso ciations between these obesity traits and leading causes ofmortality from non communicable diseases in the UK Biobank. Sex differences in the effect estimates were assessed using Cochran âs Q test (P het). Results: Up to 194,697 men and 227,717 women were included, with mean (SD) age 57.0 (8.1) and 56.6 (7.9) years, BMI 27.9 (4.2) and 27.0 (5.1) kg/m2and WHR 0.94 (0.07) and 0.82 (0.07), respectively. Obesity traits causally increased the risks of coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung can cer, type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and acute and chronic renal failure. BMI increased T2D risk more in women than in men (P het,5.1Ã10 6), whereas WHR increased risks of COPD (P het,5.5Ã10 6) and chronic renal failure (Phet,1.3Ã10 4) more in men than in women. Conclusions: Obesity traits increase the risk of the majority of the leading causes of mortality. There are sex differences in the effects of obesity traits on COPD, T2D, and chronic renal failure, which may have implications forhealth policy and provision of health services. J. C. Censin: None.

Gene expression pro ï¬ling (GEP) is widely used for tumor classi ï¬cation and survival prediction and can effectively identify patients who can bene ï¬t from particular types of therapy. A recent study has identi ï¬ed a GEP related to the response of MM patients to the ï¬rst line treatment based on bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexa methasone (VTD). The variability of gene expression depends in part on germline genetic polymorphisms. Germline variants called expression quantitative traits loci (eQTLs) can affects gene expression. If there are eQTLs for the above mentioned GEP, they could be used as prognosticmarker in MM. Materials and Methods: We genotyped 6 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in ENTPD1, CCND1, CCND2, ARK3, HELLS , and ACTR2 genes in 1284 MM cases from the International Multiple Myeloma rESEarch (IMMEnSE) consortium, and analyzed their involvement inprogression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and response to ï¬rst line therapy. Results: Carriers of the minor (C) allele of ENTPD1 rs2153213 showed a consistent better survival (PFS: HR , 0.59, 95%CI ,0.38 0.91, p ,0.018; OS; HR ,0.7, 95%CI , 0.54 0.94,p ,0.017). Conclusion: According to GTEx the C allele of rs2153213 is associated with decreased level of ETPD1 . Lower levels of ENTPD1 have been suggested to be involved in immune modulation response against several cancers leading to a better outcome. This may explain our ï¬nding and in part the variability of MM patient âs survival. A. Macauda: None. C. Piredda: None. G. Buda: None. F. Gemignani: None. M. Pelosini: None. R. M. Reis:None. J.

Epidemiological studies suggest shared aetiology between these conditions. Genetic variants, reportedly associated with them, affect lipid metabolism,cell proliferation, immune and in ï¬ammatory response, and oxidative stress, thus suggesting shared pathophysiological processes. However, the phenotypic variance responsiblefor T2D and depression captured by genome wide associa tion studies (GWAS) explains only ~5% of susceptibility to these conditions. We aimed to identify genetic factorscontributing to their co morbidity using multi variable analytical framework. Methods: We analysed data from population based Northern Finland birth cohort using 46 years old clinical examination from 3,597 participants, Haplotype Reference consortium imputed genome wide IlluminaHumanCNV370DUO platform data was quality controlled providing >10M autosomal SNPs for analysis. Using SCOPA software, we performed the multiple phenotypeGWAS (MP GWAS) as linear combination of residuals for T2D, anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 item Scale)1762and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) score, obtained after adjusting for sex and three principal components to control for population structure. Results: Three loci, at MICAL2 (rs10765927), INPP5K (rs145536147) and ZNF599 (rs7259475) reached genome wide signi ï¬cance (P<5Ã10 8). Expression of target genes at these loci, involved in cell growth, insulin metabolism and transcriptional regulation, takes place primarily in the brain and is decreased in presence of depression. rs10765927,rs145536147 and rs7259475 were associated in GWAS with neuroticism, Parkinson âs and Alzheimer âs diseases, respectively.

Main outcomes were that associated common risk variants are primarily locatedin non coding regions, have low to moderate effect sizes, and show extended stretches of LD. For functional translation of these ï¬ndings, approaches such as eQTL analyses are often applied, but this approach is restricted to traits for which disease relevant cell types/tissues are available. An alternative approach is via the identi ï¬cation of rare, deleterious mutations in individual families, and/or theincreased burden of low frequency variants in affecteds. As whole genome sequencing is currently too expensive for large cohorts, targeted approaches (e.g., single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs)) have emerged as strong alternative. Selection criteria for candidate regions include integrated functional and genomic data. In this study we applied this strategy to non syndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P), a frequent birth defect with multifactorial etiology. We selected three riskloci that had shown association with nsCL/P in previous GWAS ( P<10 05) and identi ï¬ed twelve candidate elements in the credible SNP regions, based on functional data fromneural crest cells and craniofacial tissue. SmMIPs based resequencing of these regions in 1,061 nsCL/P cases and 1,591 controls yielded 1,835 variants with a MAF<1%.These variants are currently analyzed both individually and in aggregate (burden analyses). Furthermore, different non coding variant annotation tools are evaluated, and pedigreeanalyses will be performed.

Results: The prevalence of MC4R cLOF mutations was 0.08%. The 276 carriers differed from 314,2017 non carriers in: height ( P,0.033), BMI ( P,1.20E 05), WHR (P,0.016), various measures of body fat and muscle mass, and basal metabolic rate ( P,3.12E 07) after adjustment for age and sex. Since only 31% of carriers were obese, and 25% were within the âhealthy âBMI range, we sought to investigate genetic factors in ï¬uencing penetrance. GRS for BMI did not appear to modulate penetrance. Co carriage of the protective V103I MC4R variant moderated the effect the cLoF mutation, such that 50% of cLoF carriers, who also had V103I had normal BMI compared to 25% without V103I. Conclusions: Our appreciation of phenotypic variability among MC4R cLOF mutation barriers is compromised by ascertainment bias. An unexpectedly high proportion ofmutation carriers in the UK Biobank are not obese. This may be at least partly due to epistatic effects. A. M. Yiorkas: None. O. Leinhard: None. A. I.

Recent studies suggest that genetic variants associated with higher âfat expandability âcontribute to this paradox by higher storage of metabolically inert, subcutaneous fat. Whether these variants attenuate the impact of long term weight gain oncardiometabolic risk remains unknown. Objective: We examined whether a âfat expandability â genetic risk score (GRS) attenuates the detrimental impactof weight gain on cardiometabolic risk during a 5 year follow up. We also examined whether the GRS predicts MHO baseline status and the persistence of such status. Methods: The GRS was constructed by combining 24 genetic loci robustly associated with increased BMI butdecreased waist hip ratio. The interactions of the GRS*weight gain on quantitative cardiometabolic traits and associations with MHO status were examined in 5,348 participants of the Danish Inter99 cohort. MHO was de ï¬ned as BMI â¥25 kg/m 2in the presence of none or only one component of metabolic syndrome. Results: The GRS attenuated the impact of weight gain on fasting insulin by 0.03 pmol/L per allele per each kg of body weight gained during the follow up (P interac tion,0.031). The GRS was associated with higher odds of being MHO at baseline (OR ,1.04 per allele, P ,0.0002) but did not reduce the odds of converting from MHO to ametabolically unhealthy state by 5 year follow up (OR,1.00 per allele, P ,0.679).

However, the relationship between long itudinal changes in these phenotypes and differential methylation is underexplored. We assessed associationsbetween DNAm and change over time in 228 blood metabolomics based variables and waist/hip ratio; body mass index (BMI); fasting blood plasma glucose (FG),blood insulin, and serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels. For 595 non diabetic individuals from the Northern Fin land Birth Cohort 1966 for whom phenotype data wereavailable at both ages 31 (T1) and 46 (T2) as well as con current blood DNAm data at T2, we calculated the average change in phenotype value per year between T1 and T2.

We sequenced their regulatory and coding regions, associating genetic polymorphisms with qualitative and quantitative measurements of eye color,as well as the presence or absence of iris features. Materials and Methods: A sample of 340 individuals from SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil, was strati ï¬ed according to eye pigmentation and presence or absence of iris features. DNA libraries were prepared using Haloplex (Agilent) and sequenced at the MiSeq platform (Illumina). CutAdapt, BWA and GATK were used for trimming, alignment andgenotype calling, respectively. Results: 170 polymorphisms were called and eleven were associated with one or more qualitative and quantitative eyecolor phenotypes, as well as with iris features. The HERC2 rs12913832 polymorphism was associated with the largest number of phenotypes, with its ""G"" allele associated withblue/green eyes. Additionally, this polymorphism was associated with iris features for the ï¬rst time, such as Wolfï¬in's nodes ( p,1.0x10 4), contraction furrows ( p, 5.0x10 4) and iris pigmentation spots ( p,0.0013). The HERC2 polymorphism rs58358300 was associated with sclera pigmentation ( p,1.0x10 4), hitherto not reported. Conclusions: We identi ï¬ed previously unknown asso ciations of polymorphisms with some eye pigmentation characteristics, which reinforces the need for studies inhighly admixed populations such as the Brazilian, which presents favorable conditions for the identi ï¬cation of new variation sites that may have a functional effect on pig mentation genes.

Genome sequencing has become inexpensive and fast. This provides opportunities for investigation of rare variation. In thesearch for disease associated rare variation, family based designs have again become common, because high penetrant genotypes segregate in pedigrees. Association testing is typically used to identify associa tion with rare variants. When related subjects are includedAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1765in the sample, a kinship matrix must be used to account for relatedness between subjects. Relationships may be known from the pedigree structure, or can be inferred using observed genotypes. For subjects without genotype data, however, no approach is able to infer relatedness. Pedigree based imputation increases the sample size and thus association power, and provides genotype probabilities in subjects without genotype data. If phenotypes are avail able for such subjects, including them in the analysis islikely to maximize power to detect association between genotypes and phenotype. However, knowing the relation ship between such subjects and the remaining ones, espe cially across pedigrees, is crucial to control type 1 error. Here, we propose a solution for inferring cryptic relat edness between subjects with complete missing genotypes. Our approach uses GIGI to estimate the probabilities of missing genotypes, and integrates them in an Expectation Maximization approach to estimate kinship coef ï¬cients.

Lindstrand1 1Karolinska institutet, Stockholm, Sweden,2Royal institute of technology, Stockholm, Sweden,3Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden Abstract Novel sequences, not present in the human reference genome, are abundant and remain largely unexplored. Here, we utilize de novo assembly to study novel sequences present in 1000 Swedish individuals ï¬rst sequenced as part of the SweGen project revealing a total of 51Mbp in 69098 distinct contigs of sequences not present inGRCh38. The contigs were then aligned to the comprehen sive blast database, a recently published catalogue of Icelandic novel sequences, the unmappable sequences of thePan African genome, as well as the chimpanzee genome, revealing a great diversity of shared sequences. Addition ally, the unmappable sequences were searched for repeatsand repeat elements: revealing a majority (58%) of repetitive sequence, consisting mainly of satellites (19%) and simple repeats (26%). Clustering all 1000 individualsbased on their novel sequences resulted two clusters of similar size. One cluster is characterized by a higher degreeof shared novel sequences, while the other was found to be diverse: as if sampled from a founder population, as well as a large, and diverse minority population. Finally, by aligning publicly available low coverage whole genome sequencing data from 23 Viking age individuals to our modern Swedish novel sequence catalogue, we show thatgenome sequences from Viking age individuals are enriched in novel sequences from modern day Swedes.

Aim: Exploration of time related environmental dis tributional differences, their detection and signi ï¬cance for the assessment of similarity in pregnancy duration between relatives. Methods: 454435 parent child, 2247065 full siblings, 405116 maternal and 469995 paternal half siblings pairs were retrieved from the Swedish Birth Register. The pre sence of time related environmental changes was deter mined by analyzing the shape of pregnancy duration distribution over the years 1973 2012. The effect on the correlation estimate was evaluated by analyzing variation inthe magnitude of correlation estimates between the relatives born in periods of time with differently shaped pregnancy duration distributions, and relatives with different age gapsin between. Results: Over the years, the distribution of pregnancy duration is left shifting. Distributional differences wereobserved among relatives born in largely spaced periods of time. Decreasing correlation estimates together withincreasing age gap was observed among all siblings pairs. On the other hand, among full siblings born within 2 years of one another, the correlation estimate increases sig niï¬cantly over the years, with some decrease in the mid 1990s. Conclusion: The assumption of equal environmental conditions, in the case of pregnancy duration, is dif ï¬cult to be met due to broad palette of environmental factors affecting the outcome. Caution when interpreting the her itability estimates must be taken. D. Modzelewska: None. P. Sole Navais: None. G. Zhang: None. L. Muglia: None. S. Nilsson: None. B. Jacobsson: None.",2019

National epidemiological studies of RD prevalence are uncommon. This study aims to derivethe incidence of paediatric RD and its mortality case number for children born in the year 2000. Materials and Methods: Cases were identi ï¬ed using electronic/manual records from: National Paediatric Mor tality Registry of ï¬ce; Clinical, Cytogenetics and Molecular genetics database; Radiology and the Hospital In PatientEnquiry system (HIPE). In addition, a detailed analysis of 10years national death registration information for RDs from 2006 2016 was undertaken along with a 2year study(2015 2016) of inpatient RD deaths. Results :There were 54,789 livebirths in 2000. Clinical, Cytogenetic and Molecular Genetics identi ï¬ed 603, 121 and 77 cases of RDs respectively. HIPE searches (two major centres) identi ï¬ed 370 and 702 additional cases of RD. Mortality data (2006 2016) revealed 65.7% of 105 deathsfrom the 2000 cohort had a RD. Of all deaths on the Reg ister (2006 2016), (n ,4044) aged 0 14, 58.56% (n ,2368) had a RD diagnosis. Of the total hospital days used by thiscohort (n ,5566.5) 84%(n ,4668.5) of the total day usage and 77% (3137/4059) of ICU days used were by RD patients. Conclusions: This study has identi ï¬ed > 1,800 RD patients presenting by age 17 giving a minimum incidenceof 3.3% for paediatric RDs. 65.7% of paediatric mortality cases for the year 2000 cohort and 58.6% of all cases from 2006 2016 had a RD.

These chronic, degenerative and life threatening diseases are scarce and diverse, resulting in alack of knowledge and expertise. Orphanet ( www.orpha. net) is a publicly accessible RD knowledge base containing curated epidemiological indicators. Accurate epidemiologi cal information about RDs as a group is necessary to inform public policy. Methods: Univariate analysis of Orphanet data ( www. orphadata.org ). Global point prevalence of RDs was deter mined from the âOrphanet Epidemiological File âby selecting RDs described by âpoint prevalence âfrom pre deï¬ned geographic regions for analysis, and summing point prevalences. Results: Point prevalence is the appropriate epidemiolo gical indicator for 85.9% (n ,5304) of RDs and annual incidence for 14.1% of RDs. 71.7% (n ,4425) of RDs are genetic (known/suspected familial; inherited or de novo single gene disorders; mitochondrial diseases; and chro mosomal rearrangements). 11.9% of RDs are exclusively adult onset. The minimum cumulative point prevalence ofRDs was calculated of 3.5 5.9%, or 263 to 446 million persons affected worldwide by RDs at any point in time. While 84.5% of the 3585 RDs analysed had a point pre valence of < 1/1,000,000, 77.3 80.7% of the population burden of RDs was attributable to 149 (4.2%) diseases with prevalence of 1 5 per 10,000; and >95% of the populationburden of RDs was attributable to 390 diseases. Conclusion: Our conservative estimate of 3.5% to 5.9% is the ï¬rst evidence based estimate of the population pre valence of RDs.

31176,"Villejuif, France The wide availability of Next Generation Sequence data opens new opportunities to discover rare variants associated to rare or common diseases. Rare variants association testshave been proposed speci ï¬cally to this end. To obtain a higher statistical power, they test association between a whole genomic region (usually encompassing one gene)and the disease. These tests can be broadly classi ï¬ed in two categories: burden tests (CAST, WSS) and variance tests (SKAT). However, even these tests may have an unsatisfactory power, due to the limited size of case samples and to the large number of genes to be tested when an agnosticapproach is used. In this context, incorporating information on clinical heterogeneity among cases, e.g. differences in disease presentation, severity or age at onset, is an appeal ing way to build association tests with a higher sensitivity. We propose extensions of both burden and variance tests to the situation where the cases are divided in such sub groups. The burden tests were extended by means of a multinomial logistic regression. A geometrical interpreta tion of the SKAT test for binary phenotypes was used toconstruct a natural extension of this test to our setting. The power of these tests was investigated under various simu lation scenarios. They were also applied on some real dataexamples. An ef ï¬cient implementation of the proposed tests has been made available in an R package, Ravages, which isdeposited on github ( https://github.com/genostats/Ravages ). O. Bocher: None. G.

Long non coding RNA (lncRNA) have previously been demonstrated to be enriched within genomewide association study (GWAS) loci, however the sig niï¬cance of this enrichment, its relevance, and its generalisability to individual traits is unknown. Materials and Methods: Using fgwas, the ability of individual annotations to improve a probabilistic model of disease susceptibility was tested. Publicly available lncRNAannotations, including lncRBase, lncipedia and the miTranscriptome assembly, were incorporated, in addition to cell type speci ï¬c chromatin states annotations. Results: Using fgwas it is possible to reproduce a pre viously reported enrichment of enhancers active in primary T helper cells amongst RA GWAS loci (log 2enrichment 2.96, 95% con ï¬dence interval [2.01, 3.69]), however esti mates for enrichment of lncRNA are statistically insignif icant. Interestingly, the miTranscriptome assembly,previously used to demonstrate an enrichment of lncRNA amongst GWAS loci, is demonstrated to be depleted amongst RA loci, using fgwas (log 2enrichment 0.80, 95% conï¬dence interval [ 1.70, 0.08]). The enrichment estimate associated with alternative databases of lncRNA seems to vary based on the protein coding potential threshold appliedto discriminate against protein coding transcripts and appears to be independent of chromatin state annotations. Conclusions: Whilst at speci ï¬c GWAS loci, long non coding RNA may represent interesting candidates for functional interrogation we found no evidence to support an enrichment of long non coding RNA amongst RAsusceptibility loci.

Here, analysing genome wide distribution of ROHs in offsprings of 100 consangui neous families we observed a non uniform distribution. Using multiple linear model we demonstrated that this variation could be explained by (i) recombination level, i.e.the higher the recombination in a given region, the less the number of ROHs; and (ii) selection, i.e. the higher the pLI score (which estimates loss of function intolerance) of theembedded genes the less the number of ROHs. The observed selection component might be explained by elimination of carriers of homozygous recessive loss offunction mutations in genes with high pLI. To examine the selection component further we strati ï¬ed ROHs by age and length following a previously suggested classi ï¬cation: class A (old and short: < 0.6 Mb), class B (intermediate in age and length: 0.6 1.6 Mb) and class C (young and long: > 1.6 Mb) and rerun our analyses. We observed that while thedistribution of all three classes is shaped by recombination, only the class C ROHs showed a strong negative relation ship with pLI, suggesting that younger ROHs are understronger selection. Altogether our results provide additional metrics (properties of affected genes, ROH classes), which should be taken into account inferring deleterious effect ofROHs in GWAS and genetic medicine. K.

Following the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) we started to build a pilot algorithm for SF management based on ES datafrom families analysed in research setting due to intellectual disability in their children. The ACMG recommendations focus on genes in ï¬uencing health risks for individuals themselves. However, most families are tested as trios, and the couples are often young and planning to have another child. The data contain information on parental carrier statusfor severe hereditary disorders, and SF may also be extended to variants with implications for future children and reproductive choices. Therefore, our pilot SF algorithmcombines evaluation of ACMG recommended genes and analysis of parental carrier status for risk variants in recessive and X linked genes. Until now, 260 individualsfrom 77 families have been analysed. The data show that at least 2.3 % of individuals carry variants in ACMG recommended genes reported in ClinVar as pathogenic/likely pathogenic (e.g. BRCA2, RET), and couples may exist where both partners carry variants causing a recessive disorder (e.g. VPS13B). We propose discussion on theextension of SF to variants associated with risks for future reproduction. The next stage of the algorithm will be to explore the inclusion of this extension into informedconsent and genetic counselling.

Although the ancestral background is an important factor for sepsis susceptibility and prevalence, no study has leveraged the genetic footprint of a recentadmixture in the population for the identi ï¬cation of loci involved in sepsis susceptibility. Here we describe the results of the ï¬rst admixture mapping study in sepsis. Material and Methods: Local ancestry blocks obtained from genome wide data from 113,414 SNPs genotyped in 343 sepsis cases and 410 unrelated controls, ascertained forgrandparental origin in the Canary Islands (Spain), were used for the analysis. Signi ï¬cance was declared based on the number of ancestry blocks (p<1.82e 4). Fine mappinganalysis were assessed with logistic and conditional regressions on HRC imputed data. Results and Conclusions: A signi ï¬cant hit was identi ï¬ed in a region spanning 1.2 Mb of chromosome 8q23.1 for the European ancestry supported by 114 SNPs (lowest p,1.37e 4; OR ,0.51; 95%CI ,0.40 0.65). 8q23.1 contains MFHAS1 gene, which encodes a regulator of the Toll like receptor 2 and 4 signaling pathways. MFHAS1 has been proposed as a biomarker for sepsis and genetic variants ofthe gene have been associated with immune diseases. Our results revealed a new genetic locus with plausible impli cations in sepsis susceptibility.

Identi ï¬cation of sex speci ï¬c GWAS loci can help understanding the mechanisms underlying such sex differ ences. To address this challenge, we applied atranscriptome wide summary statistics based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) to waist hip ratio (WHR) combining whole blood eQTLs and sex speci ï¬c GWAS summary statistics from UKBiobank. Our results recapitulated the marked sexual dimorphism known for WHR: in the sex combined analysis, we found 203 genescausally associated with WHR; of note, 38 and 26 genes were causally associated to WHR in women or men only, respectively (top genes: ENTPD6 ,P TWMR,7.9E 11 in men; CALCRL ,PTWMR,4.6E 12 in women). Consistently, 16 of these 64 genes showed signi ï¬cant sex difference ( P diff<0.05/203 ,2.5E 04). Conducting TWMR separately in men and women not only improves power to identify sex speciï¬c associations, but also allows testing for sex differences. As might be expected, we did not observe thesame power improvement when we applied TWMR to traits not showing sexual dimorphism, such as educational attainment (EA). Out of the 49 genes causally associatedwith EA, only 4 and 5 were speci ï¬c to women and men, respectively. Although previous data indicate that eQTL effects are not strongly in ï¬uenced by sex, it will be crucial to perform the same analyses with sex speci ï¬c eQTL data generated from larger data sets to dissect sex speci ï¬c effects appearing up vsdown stream of gene regulation.

Here we have reassessed their genomic diversity and structure based on alternative high dimensional analysis techniques. Materials and Methods: A total of 117K variants from 618 unrelated subjects from the seven main islands of the archipelago ascertained based on grandparental birthplacewere compared. Topological data analysis (TDA) was conducted using umap v0.2.0 R library both based on raw genotyping data and 2 to 20 PCs derived with PLINK v1.9. Results: Three main population aggregated clusters were identi ï¬ed: two corresponding to the smallest islands of the archipelago (El Hierro and La Gomera), and a Y shapedcluster aggregating the rest of Canary Islanders. In addition, TDA based on six PCs showed intriguing subdivisions within La Gomera, the population showing the largest NorthAfrican in ï¬uences described so far for a southwestern European population. Conclusions: High dimensional data analysis suggests that extreme isolation in the populations from El Hierro and La Gomera is a major source of genetic sub structure in Canary Islanders.

Telomere length(TL) is shortened progressively with age. Many studies revealed that age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise could result in shorter telomere length. However,these factors associated with TL are also contributed to cardio metabolic components/diseases. Several genetic loci associated with telomere length have been identi ï¬ed. The study was aimed to assess whether telomere length causally affects cardio metabolic components using Mendelian randomization design. Methods: A total of 2543 adults were recruited from the Matsu community based integrated health screening pro ject. Five SNPs ( TERC rs12696304, rs16847897, TERT rs2736100, FTO rs9930506, rs9939609) associated with telomere length were used as instrument variables to esti mate the causal effect of telomere length on cardio metabolic components by Mendelian randomization analy sis using two stage least square instrumental variable (IV) regression. Results: We found that both FTO rs9930506 and rs9939609 SNPs were signi ï¬cantly associated with telo mere length (p<0.05), but not the other three telomerelength related SNPs. The results of linear regression showed that telomere length was not signi ï¬cantly associated with waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressures,fasting glucose, lipid levels (all with p>0.05). Mendelian randomization using two stage least square IV regression did not show that telomere length instrumented by the twoFTO SNPs, were associated with any cardio metabolic components (p>0.05).

The remaining 24 variants where identi ï¬ed on genes suspected to be responsible for thrombocytopenia in human or already studied in mouse models (7 TUBA8 ,8 ITGB3 ,5ITGA2 ,2RASGRP2 and 2 TUBA4A ). These results indicate that at least 5% of healthy donors with moderate thrombocytopenia carry a constitutional anomalyin a gene responsible for this platelet count defect. A. Dupuis: None. P.

However, such procedure most commonly focuses on a fewmain dimensions limiting the possibilities to excavate ï¬ne grained strata. Here we used topological data analysis (TDA) to embed high dimensionality of SNP array data toexplore the degree of genetic differentiation between Canary Islanders and the Iberian Peninsula population (IBS). Materials and Methods: We used data from 46 Canary Islanders along with 740 unrelated subjects from IBS and 23 North Africans (NAF) for reference. PCA and TDA wereassessed on quality controlled data using the PLINK v1.9 and umap v0.2.0 library for R. Results: By leveraging the information from as few as 136K independent SNPs embedded within a 2 to 50 PC space, we found highly distinctive patterns of differentiation between Canary Islanders and the IBS populations despitetheir shared Spanish ancestry. Strikingly, most Canary Islanders clustered closer to NAF, although a few indivi duals clustered with IBS. Conclusions: TDA provides an optimal alternative to reveal previously unrecognized ï¬ne structure separating IBS from Canary Islanders, compatible with genetic driftand differential admixtures. Co clustering of Canary Islan ders both with NAF and IBS supports wide interindividual variation in ancestries, re ï¬ective of their recent history.

Both conditions are complex traits and we aimed at dissecting their polygenic structure in association with tissue speci ï¬c gene expression regulation. Materials and Methods: We estimated the SNP heritability on the liability scale and genetic correlation byapplying LD score regression analysis to the largest meta analysis results (6,167 BE cases, 4,112 EA cases, 17,159 controls). We performed Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)modeling. We analysed gene expression alterations by means of Transcriptome Wide Association Study (TWAS) and FUMA platform. We modeled the gene expression PRS(GE PRS) based on the PrediXcan and MetaXcan imputed gene expression pro ï¬les. Results: SNP heritability (h2) for BE was h2 ,0.20, h2,0.13 for EA, and h2 ,0.15 for the combined cohort (BE and EA). The genetic correlation between BE and EA was r g,0.85. We identi ï¬ed a strong association of PRS com paring BE against controls (p ,3.7*10 5), EA against con trols (p ,3.5*10 7), and the combined cohort (BE and EA) against controls (p ,5*10 13), but no association comparing BE against EA (p ,0.09). Esophagus tissues were prior itized as the most signi ï¬cant by FUMA, and the TWAS uncovered particular genes among these tissues (e.g.,BTN3A2 ) whose expression was signi ï¬cantly altered (p,3*10 7). Finally, the GE PRS model in the esophagusmucosa tissue was signi ï¬cantly associated with the case/ control status (p ,1.2*10 8). Conclusion: Our work dissected a strong polygenic component of Barrett âs esophagus and Esophageal adeno carcinoma, we identi ï¬ed potential candidate genes and established gene expression alterations in disease speci ï¬c tissues.

Noteworthy, both increased prevalence and genetic correla tion have been reported for SCZ and IBD, which suggests potential shared molecular mechanisms between these traits. Materials and Methods: We performed a cross phenotype transcriptome wide association study (TWAS) using the largest available summary statistics for SCZ(36.989 cases, 113.075 controls) and IBD (18.431 Crohn's disease cases, 14.191 ulcerative colitis cases, and 33.6581774controls). We imputed the genetically regulated component of gene expression by integrating GWAS signals with tissue speci ï¬c Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) in 48 tissues. We used models trained on data from the Genotype Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). Results: The combined evaluation of SCZ and IBD TWAS results revealed a signi ï¬cant enrichment of asso ciated genes overlapping between SCZ and IBD in different tissues. Interestingly, colon and brain were among the topsigniï¬cant tissues. Genes from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are also among the most strongly TWAS associated genes, which is in line with correspondinggenetic signals in SCZ and IBD. Conclusion: Our TWAS results suggest that the genetic correlation between SCZ and IBD can be associated withgene expression alteration in tissues involved in the reg ulation of the gut brain axis and that MHC genes may play a pivotal role. In order to further investigate this hypothesis,we intend to perform cross phenotype TWAS including other psychiatric and immune related traits showing genetic correlation. C. Maj: None. O.

Additionally, a form of senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) is due to the misfolding of the protein product of the same gene. Non coding variation inTTR gene appears to have a key role in affecting the clinical phenotype of carriers of coding mutation and increasing the risk of SSA in non carriers. To understand the role of TTR gene non coding variation, we conducted a phenome wide association study in the UK Biobank. Materials and Methods: We investigated 18,823 var iants located in TTR gene and its surrounding genomic regions (GRCh37 chromosome 18: 27171000 â31171500) in 361,194 participants from the UK Biobank with respect to more than 4,000 traits, which include a wide range ofphysiological and pathological conditions. Results: TTR non coding variants were signi ï¬cantly associated with multiple phenotypic traits after multipletesting correction (false discovery rate q value < 0.05). Among these signi ï¬cant results, we observed several associations related to known signs of TTR amyloidosis:renal failure (rs150146618, p ,1.33x10 6); disorders related to central nervous system (rs8091089, p ,1.24x10 6); and cardiac failure (rs145777295, p ,2.52 x 10 6). Additionally, a sex strati ï¬ed analysis showed signi ï¬cant differences between females and males in the effects of TTR non coding variants. Conclusions: The study provides novel insights regard ing the molecular mechanisms involved in ATTR and SSA, demonstrating the effect of TTR non coding variation on human phenome. A. De Lillo: None.

Methods: We applied Prentice weighted Cox regression models to a case cohort sample of 9,556 men and women from the Danish prospective Diet, Cancer and Healthcohort. 49.5% of the participants developed T2D during an average 12 years of follow up. A favorable lifestyle was deï¬ned as having three of the following healthy lifestyle factors: no current smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, and healthy diet. An unfavorable lifestyle was de ï¬ned as no or only one healthy lifestyle factor while the remaining participants were de ï¬ned as having an intermediate lifestyle. Genetic risk was assessed by a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising 213 genetic locirobustly associated with T2D. The GRS was strati ï¬ed into low (lowest 25%), intermediate (middle 50%) and high risk (top 25%) groups. Results: Adherence to a favorable lifestyle and normal weight decreased T2D risk independent of genetic predis position (P>0.05 for GRS lifestyle and GRS obesity inter action). Obesity (BMI â¥30 kg/m 2) increased T2D risk by 5.8 fold (95% CI: 5.2 6.6) compared to non obese indivi duals, while the independent effects of high (vs. low)genetic risk and unfavorable (vs. favorable) lifestyle were relatively modest (HR ,1.8, 95% CI 1.6 2.0; and HR ,1.2, 95% CI 1.1 1.3, respectively). Conclusions: Individuals with poor lifestyle and obesity are at greater risk of incident T2D regardless of their genetic risk.

Basic studies suggest moderately raised bilirubin may be bene ï¬cial and protect respiratory systems against oxidative stress from infection, smoke and pollution. Here we report the results of the ï¬rst large scale Mendelian randomisation examining the causal relationship between serum bilirubin and respiratory cancer. Materials and Methods: This research has been con ducted using unrelated participants of European ancestry from the UK Biobank Resource. Homozygosity for theminor T allele of rs887829 in the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 1 gene is associated with serum bilirubin levels 8 10 Î¼mol/l (80 100%) higher than thosewithout this genotype. Using multivariable Poisson regres sion, we analysed the relationship between rs887829 and the incidence of respiratory and intrathoracic cancersderived from national registers. All analyses were strati ï¬ed by smoking status with heavy smoking de ï¬ned as â¥20 cigarettes per day. Results: 323,702 participants (median follow up 5.5 years) and 918 cancer events were included in the analyses. Overall homozygosity for the T allele of rs887829(n,31,794) was associated with a 22% lower incidence of respiratory cancer (95%CI:0 48%; p value ,0.047) com pared with other genotypes. Strati ï¬ed analysis revealed this effect was driven by heavy smokers with a 59% lower incident rate (95%CI:38 76%; p value ,0.0018). Conclusion: Genetically raised bilirubin could help pro tect people exposed to high levels of oxidants against respiratory cancers. Serum bilirubin may therefore represent a therapeutic target as well as a low cost biomarker for disease risk strati ï¬cation. Wellcome Trust funded:209207/ Z/17/Z L. J. Horsfall: None. S.

31191,"Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden The genetic contribution to, and the disease related effects of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) are largely unexplored due to the requirements of advanced imaging technologies toaccurately measure VAT. We therefore developed non linear prediction models of VAT mass using 4,1981776individuals of white British ancestry from UK Biobank (UKBB). VAT mass was then predicted in 325,153 UKBB participants, aged 40 73 years. We performed a genome wide association (GWA) study for predicted VAT mass (VAT^) and estimated the association between VAT^ and hypertension, heart attack/angina, type 2 diabetes, andhyperlipidemia. Causal effects on disease risk were assessed by Mendelian randomisation. The GWA study identi ï¬ed 209 independent genetic associations for VAT^, represent ing 102 novel loci. Functional analyses showed a signi ï¬cant difference, both in expression and promoter activity between the alleles of rs1799993, located in the HMBS promoter. VAT^ was associated with increased risk of disease with a more pronounced effect in females compared to males ( p<0.0001). The largest observed effect was found for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, a pronounced non linear effect of VAT^ on disease risk was uncovered for all four diseases ( p<0.0001). Finally, Mendelian randomisation showed VAT^ to be a casual risk factor and a remarkably high causal OR ,7.34 (95% CI 4.48 12.0) was found for type 2 diabetes in females.

31192,"Institute for Biomedicine, Eurac Research, Bolzano, ItalyIntroduction: Thus far, only few rare variant association signals have been identi ï¬ed. Given their expected larger impact on complex traits, it is valuable to study their association in different contexts (e.g., homogeneous environmental conditions) and not only in large biobanks. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) association analyses were performed for association with 56 biochemical traits in 3840 individuals from thepopulation based CHRIS study using the xGen Exome Research Panel (v1.0) and processed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK v3.7) pipeline. After QC,3422 samples remained, with a mean target coverage of 68.4X. WES variants were validated against In ï¬niumOmni2.5Exome BeadChip genotype data, with which there was concordance of 0.998 across overlapping variants. We performed single variant association analysis using EMMAX to account for family structure, and gene based association analysis using SKAT, grouping variants masked as either âLoFâorâhigh moderate impact â. We used VEP/ LOFTEE for annotation. For both approaches, analyses were repeated conditioning on all previously known variant trait associations collated from the EBI GWAScatalog, to ensure novelty of identi ï¬ed associations. Results: In total, 825,158 rare variants (MAF<0.5%) were identi ï¬ed across all samples. The single variant association analysis identi ï¬ed 60 novel variant trait asso ciations (P<2e 7), which clustered to 22 loci trait associa tions. Gene based association analysis yielded27 signi ï¬cant gene trait associations (P<3.3e 6), of which 5 were completely novel, and 5 were novel gene level signals near known single variant associations. Conclusion: In the age of large Biobanks, relatively small but well characterized population based studies remain important for elucidating the genetic architecture of quan titative traits. D. B.

We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify genomic regions under selective processes. Materials and Methods: WGS from Canary Islanders (n,46) were obtained and variant calling was assessed using BWA GATK. WGS data from NAF (n ,23), and SSA and EUR from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP), were used for comparisons. Selection signals were identi ï¬ed with distinct neutrality tests. Values in the extremes of the distributions were prioritized and used for enrichment analysis. Results: A total of 14.4 million variants were identi ï¬ed in Canary Islanders, and about a ï¬fth was not described in 1KGP. Neutrality tests identi ï¬ed a number of putative regions of selection. Attending to PBS, the largest values were located in the HLA, supporting different independent signals. Autoimmune, ophthalmologic, and oncologic dis eases were among the top enriched terms in the prioritized regions.

31195,"whole genomes (Illumina 30x coverage), which representsthe genetic variation in the Swedish population. Since its ï¬rst release in 2016, the SweGen variant data has become a widely used resource with about 200 monthly visits to thewebsite both from Sweden and abroad (swefreq.nbis.se). During the course of the project it has become apparent that1778the SweGen data can serve many more purposes than just providing information about SNPs and small indel variants in the Swedish population. We have therefore initiated a number of follow up projects to increase the value of the resource. Examples of ongoing activities are: i) detection of complex structural variation, ii) analysis of genetic variationin the MHC region, iii) characterization of haplotypes of pharmacogenetic utility, iv) detection of somatic genomic aberrations, and v) utilization of SweGen data for improvedSNP array imputation. In addition, we have constructed de novo high quality reference genomes for one male and one female SweGen individual, based on multiple long readsequencing technologies (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics and BioNano). These two assemblies are among the most complete individual human genomes to date, andsurprisingly we detected over 10Mb of sequence in each individual that is missing from the current version of the human reference genome (GRCh38).

Johansson1 1Uppsala university, Uppsala, Sweden,2Stockholm university, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction: Despite the success of genome wide associa tion (GWA) studies, much of the genetic contribution to complex diseases and phenotypes remains unexplained. Two major limitations in GWA studies are the lack ofpower to test the effect of rare alleles and the use of genotyped or imputed SNPs. Materials and Methods: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and measurements of over 400 disease related biomarkers were produced in 1,021 individuals from a cross sectional Swedish cohort. We scored variants usingCADD or Eigen scores. We then developed a pipe line for exploring the combined effects of common and rare genetic variants on biomarker levels in a gene wise manner. Results: For coding variants, we identi ï¬ed 158 inde pendent signals, of which 52 was in trans. Six of these wereassociated with the expression levels of several biomarkers. For regulatory regions, only cis regulatory elements were analysed, and for as many as 191 biomarkers we identi ï¬ed at least one regulatory element that was associated with the expression of the biomarker. Conclusions: We have shown that analysing the com bined effect of rare and common variants in a gene based approach increases the power to detect genetic effects, compared to a GWA study. Many of our associated signalscontain multiple rare, and even population speci ï¬c variants, which highlights the importance of more sophisticated methods for analysing WGS data in relation to human traits.

31198,"The importance of providing culturally competent and culturally appropriate genetic counselling is recognized bythe profession, as culture âs role is crucial in molding an individual âs conceptualization of health and illness. There is a dearth of literature on the provision of genetics servicesincluding genetic counselling for indigenous populations globally. Although exploratory studies have been published regarding the provision of genetics services for theindigenous populations of Australia, New Zealand, Philip pines and the United States, few have described genetics services for the Canadian Indigenous populations (FirstNations, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples). Ottawa, Canada serves at theâlocal âgenetics service for residents of Baf ï¬n Island, Nunavut, which has an Inuit population of approximately15,000. We describe the Ottawa Baf ï¬n Nunavut Services (OBNS) program, as it relates to the provision of genetics services for Inuit persons, including travel coordination,lodging, traditional diet, Inuktitut interpretation services, and medical records coordination. We present a re ï¬ective review of cases illustrating the genetic counselling chal lenges, including building rapport, pedigree taking, patient isolation from their community, and cultural views of decision making. We share personal stories of the humblingjourney as genetic counsellors providing genetics services for Inuit persons from Nunavut and the lessons learned in cultural competency. Exploring these issues has never beenmore important, as Canada embarks on the Silent Genomes Project , which aims to improve the access to genomic technologies and research to Indigenous populations whileensuring Indigenous led governance over biological sam ples and health data.

Brass The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Introduction: Genomics is revolutionising healthcare enabled by techniques such as whole genome sequencing, consequentially there is a pressing need to improve genomicliteracy and data analysis skills in the healthcare workforce. In this study we demonstrate how development of the world âsï¬rst free Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) in Clinical Bioinformatics has addressed these needs in healthcare professionals and patients and the public world wide. Methodology: The MOOC is hosted by FutureLearn, exploring the subject from its initial roots to clinical working practices, ethics and tools. The social constructivistapproach embeds social discourse, enabling knowledge exchange between healthcare professionals, patients and carers. Social learning is encouraged using ""follow"", âlikeâ and ""bookmark"" buttons to applaud speci ï¬c comments. Results: Within seven course runs 17, 000 learners joined the course, the largest numbers from the UK, Egypt, Indiaand USA. Pre course surveys showed that of those who stated their profession on enrolment, 31%, the largest group, identi ï¬ed as working in health and social care. The MOOC was most popular with participants in the aged 18 35, educated to at least degree level. Post course evaluation showed 78% of 145 learners liked or strongly liked theonline discussions and enjoyed interacting with other lear ners, 92% of 80 learners said they agreed or strongly agreed that the course had increased their understanding of clinicalbioinformatics.

Outpatient service speci ï¬c to familial tumor started in 2013. In Japan, precision medicine willincrease from April 2019 with the background of national policy. We consider that it is important to review the patients and their needs to prepare future outpatients. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 100 cases of familial tumor from April 2009 to May 2018. Type of diseases, undergoing genetic test, results of the tests andtheir courses were examined retrospectively. Results: We had 95 female patients and 5 male patients as proband. The number of cases increased after familialtumor service has been started. Type of diseases were her editary breast ovary cancer (HBOC), Lynch syndrome, hereditary thyroid cancer and so on. 76 cases were sus pected HBOC and 58/76 cases underwent genetic test. Of 58 cases, 56 cases had already developed cancer. The results of the test were positive for 12 cases. Positive geneswere BRCA1 for 4 cases, BRCA2 for 4 cases and RET for 4 cases. Conclusions: The genetic counselling for HBOC is the most required in our department. We need to expand col laboration system with not only breast cancer team but also gynecological cancer team.

The diagnosis of FXS in a child often reveals the premutation carrier status of their mother. The genetic counseling process may therefore focus on the child and mother,without signi ï¬cant attention given to the information and support needs of the non carrier father. This research sought to explore the experiences and support needs speci ï¬ct o non carrier fathers of children diagnosed with FXS. Eleven interviews were conducted with non carrier fathers recruited through the Australian based Genetics ofLearning Disability (GOLD) Service and the Fragile X Association of Australia. Interviews lasted on average 78 minutes (range 61 â102 minutes). Interviews were transcribed, deidenti ï¬ed, coded and analyzed by three coders using thematic analysis with an inductive approach. Thematic saturation was reached. Four themes emerged: 1) Making Life Easier through Understanding âYesterday and Today; 2) The Path to a New Normal âToday and Tomorrow; 3) Information and Support âPaper, Scissors, Rock; and 4) What Men Want. Our study highlights some of the unmet support and information needs of non carrier fathers of children withFXS. These include the need for practical and prognostic information, guidance in supporting their families, and ï¬exible opportunities for accessing personal counseling and support. Our ï¬ndings will inform the provision of more tailored support and information, not only for fathers of children with FXS, but for other neurocognitive conditions. J. Luermans: None. J.

The aim in this study was to create a shorter form of GCOS 24.Methods: Cognitive interviews explored interpretability of GCOS 24 items and items highly valued by the target population. The Graded Response Model (GRM) was used to examine item discrimination in an existing GCOS 24 dataset (n ,395). Items with poor discriminative properties were then excluded and items capturing a similar conceptwere not selected together. Finally, quantitative and quali tative ï¬ndings were combined to identify superior items. Rasch analysis was used to establish the optimalresponse scale. Results: Ten cognitive interviews were conducted with individuals from families affected by genetic conditions,recruited through support groups. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts identi ï¬ed twelve GCOS 24 items highly valued by participants. GRM item characteristiccurves and item information curves were generated. Find ings from both analyses were used to select ten items that were both highly valued and performed well. Finally, itemswere iteratively removed and permutated to establish opti malï¬t using the Rasch model. A six item questionnaire with a ï¬ve point Likert Scale was created (The Genomics Outcome Scale (GOS)). Correlation between GCOS 24 and GOS is good (r ,.838, 99% con ï¬dence), indicating that GOS maintains the ability of GCOS 24 to captureempowerment, whilst providing a less burdensome scale for respondents. Conclusions: GOS will be less burdensome than GCOS 24 for patients and could be used where genetic testing is done outside the context of clinical genetics. Unfunded study. P. Grant: None. M.

These populations are devoted to old traditions including consanguineous marriages, (presently 24.4%), leading to an increased risk of rare autosomalrecessive disorders. Most of this population lives in small towns and villages that were founded by small number of individuals. Therefore, the diagnosis of founder mutationsallows effective genetic counselling and occasionally genetic screening.1782However, there are genetic mechanisms that make the counselling more challenging such as co inheritance of more than one recessive condition in the same sib ship. Each of these couples has 25% risk for an offspring affected by one condition and additional 25% risk for the other condition. Seven couples had 2 autosomal recessive con ditions, diagnosed in different babies. For example, Con genital thrombocytopenia/Muscular Dystrophy, Wolman/ Meckel syndromes. Counseling these couples often done following the birth of affected children, and is complex particularly after the second event. It is associated with marked emotionalstruggle of the parents, reduced self con ï¬dence and a sense of control loss, occasionally leading to mistrust of the counselling process. Family planning becomes more chal lenging, with pre implantation genetic diagnosis become advantageous, a treatment associated with medical, techni cal and personal dif ï¬culties. Genetic counselling performed by experienced and aware professionals, might improve the outcome.

31204,"Genetics, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Genetic counseling can be considered as the external image of Clinical Genetics. The way in which it is delivered is the basis for patients âand the health care system âs evaluation of the ef ï¬ciency of the ï¬eld as a medical specialty. It is thus of utmost importance that genetic counseling professionals obtain an adequate pre paration for its practice, in accordance with the complexcharacter of genetic diseases. Stern (Measuring Medical Professionalism, 2006) includes ethical and legal understanding as a foundation formedical professionalism. The ethics of genetic counseling is often reduced to the implementation of the requisite of nondirectiveness and of the elements of principialism:respect for autonomy, bene ï¬cence, non male ï¬cence and justice. Aim and Methodology: This study aims to apply other bioethical concepts to the practice of genetic counseling. Principles derived from various modern philosophical andethical modes of thought such as personalism, virtue ethics, narrative ethics and care ethics which have been applied to other medical ï¬elds or action, are herewith analyzed in the context of genetic counseling, speci ï¬cally in prenatal diagnostics. Practical implications for counseling are deduced from this analysis. Conclusion: An understanding of a wider range of bioethical concepts allows for a greater awareness of ethical requisites for proper genetic counseling. Given that thiscommunication process frequently involves value laden decisions on the part of patients and families, such an understanding can build better counselor counseled rela tionships adequately facilitating well informed, shared decision making processes.

Results: At the time of the abstract submission data is still being gathered. A preliminary analysis shows that genetic counsellors âself ef ï¬cacy in conducting genetic counselling sessions with young people is rather modest;there is overwhelming consensus on the need for more theoretical and practical training.

A guideline on the requirements for contents and quali ï¬cation in genetic counselling within the scope of each medical specialty came into force in 2011. Methods: Development of a database (GenBIn) that provides both, baseline data on utilisation of genetic counselling services prior to the GenDG (status quo ante)and data on utilisation after the enactment. Results: 26 genetic counselling centres volunteered to collect data on in person counselling cases in 2011, 34centres provided data for counselling cases seen in 2016/ 2017. In total the GenBIn database contains data on 5256 cases. Compared to 2011 the relative share of referrals byobstetricians&gynecologists has decreased (83%/63%), whilst referrals by other specialists (15%/27%) and self referrals (2%/10%) have increased in private practice. Referrals for prenatal counselling have decreased, coun selling for familial cancer and other familial disorders has increased. Workload and mean waiting time per case haveincreased. Conclusions: The data document a rising demand for genetic counselling services and a shift in indications forreferral. Arguably, the observed changes are due to a mul tiplicity of causes and are not attributable solely to the GenDG. Advances in genetic testing technology, growingawareness among healthcare providers and among patients (increased self referrals) are likely to contribute together to higher patient volumes, to increased workload and tocapacity constraints for genetic counselling services.

Many physicians report lack ofknowledge and con ï¬dence as barriers to offering appro priate genetic counselling. In response to this, ahalf day interactive workshop was developed to provide existinghealthcare professionals with current knowledge in ï¬eld of genetics. The educational program was tailored to equip providers with an awareness of the bene ï¬ts, limitations and risks of available genetic testing. Course components included basic genetic concepts, current testing methodologies, interpreta tion of results and local legal frameworks regulating genetic testing. Through case studies, providers also gained an understanding of medical, social, ethical and legal issuessurrounding genetic testing. Since 2018, the workshop has been run twice, with 2 more runs planned in 2019. Participants include more than90 healthcare providers from various healthcare professions. A pre and post course evaluation was conducted to assess knowledge improvement and self reported con ï¬dence in ordering and interpreting genetic test results. There was an improvement of a pre course score of 6 to post course score of 9 out of 12 questions. However, participants generallydid not report changes in their level of con ï¬dence in ordering or interpreting genetic test results.

Genetic counsellor (GC) involvement will be critical to successfully navigate this situation, ensuring that patients understand andbeneï¬t fully from their tests. GC expertise will be important in supporting families, especially in the face of uncertain or evolving results. Cross sectional survey data (Family Web study n ,286) supports the importance of a trusted expert who can balance these different roles. Data indicate that, in a population ofpatients at high risk of bowel cancer, the diagnosis had a profound effect on patients and their families: participants wanted more support, ideally from a care co ordinator; plusinformation on a range of topics and a positive message to give their relatives. Key issues identi ï¬ed included: gene speciï¬c risks, accessing adequate cancer surveillance, and advice on how to reduce cancer risk through lifestyle. Pressures to meet clinical targets, combined with increasingly robust GC training, have resulted in a greaterprevalence of GC led clinics for diagnostic and predictive testing. It seems likely that this will be matched by an increased emphasis on follow up. GCs possess the neces sary range of skills to provide ongoing liaison services, assisting with the two way communication that is necessary for managing uncertain results over time. Successfulgenomic services depend on patients successfully assim ilating information; GCs may be uniquely placed to support this across a range of settings.

Together with physicist MHF Wilkins they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1962. Naturalscientists added more fundamental principles to human genetics in the following decades.1786Materials and Methods: Basis are the results of the DFG Project of H. Petermann. Based on those data, we are conducting interviews with human geneticists, natural sci entists and physicians. The focus is on the role of scientists of various ï¬elds (medicine, natural sciences, anthropology) in establishing human genetics at universities in the FRG. Results: 1. In the 1950s physicians and philosophical anthropologists dominated the institutes that did mainly paternity tests. Those were paid by the courts that instructedthem. 2. In 1960 the Scienti ï¬c Council of FRG ( Wis senschaftsrat ) forced the establishment of Human Genetics Institutes as a ï¬eld of medicine. 3. Since the beginning of the 1970s National Health Insurances paid for genetic counseling by physicians, according to the German Scale of Fees for Doctors (GOÃ). 4. Therefore, two departments were established at Human Genetics Institutes: for diag nostics by natural scientists and for genetic counseling by physicians. 5. Lectures were given by physicians and nat ural scientists. Conclusions: The role of physicians and natural scientists at Human Genetics Institutes is determined by two facts:historical reasons and reimbursement of expenses.

CDH1 c.1901C>T variant carriers and non carriers were used to estimate thefounder effect age by decay of haplotype sharing methods. Carriers âclinical data were collected as they were followed in high risk consultations. Results: Germline RNA from c.1901C>T carriers demonstrated production of a single truncated transcript. All carriers shared the same ancestral haplotype in a 6.8 Mb/5.1cM region. The time to the most recent common ancestor was estimated to 489.64 [CI: 445 10,900] years. Following death of 5 DGC probands (3F:2M), aged 18 35, we iden tiï¬ed 48(24F:24M) additional carriers. In female carriers, 9 underwent RRG, 7 both RRG and RRM, and 8 endoscopic/ MRI surveillance. In male carriers, 10 underwent RRG and14 endoscopic surveillance. The application of a strict sur veillance/prophylaxis protocol, following positive genetic testing, allowed DGC (n ,4) and LBC (n ,2) early detection and sub clinical disease detection in RRG and/or RRM surgical specimens (DGC ,19, LBC ,4). Conclusion: We identi ï¬ed the ï¬rst Portuguese CDH1 related founder effect with ~500 years. Reaching out to 48 carriers from 7 families allowed to adopt appropriate risk reducing surgeries and/or surveillance, so far without fur ther cancer related deaths. *Equal contribution L.

With no current direct medical bene ï¬t to testing, as well as the uncertainty in the severity/age at which symptoms may appear, the emotional,ethical and other psychological consequences associated with the test have been found to be increased. TheAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1787importance of genetic counselling and support for at risk individuals remains crucial to enable a better understanding on the impact predictive testing can have on one âs life. However, YA have previously reported lack of emotional support and a communication barrier during these consulta tions. As there is limited research conducted on the explicitexperiences of genetic counsellors with predictive testing for HD, it is dif ï¬cult to establish why this gap in support and communication exists. The aim of this study was togain a better understanding of experiences of GCs whilst counselling at risk young adults for predictive testing for HD, as well as explore the HD service provision inScotland. Nine genetic counsellors from three regional centres in Scotland (Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee) were interviewed using a semi structured interview guide. Thematic analysis identi ï¬ed three key themes: challenges faced with young adults and Huntington âs disease, aspects of the pre symptomatic predictive testing protocol and therelationships with other health care professionals. Being made aware about these experiences can highlight gaps in training and support for genetic counsellors as well as otherhealthcare professionals. U. Savania: None. S. Lesley: None.",2019

Current practice often relies on the proband to inform relatives aboutthe possibility of predictive DNA testing, but not all relatives are informed adequately. To enable informed decision making concerning predictive DNA testing, theapproach used to inform relatives needs to be optimized. This study investigated preferences of patients, relatives, and the general population on how to inform relatives at riskof autosomal dominant diseases. Methods: Online surveys were sent to people with an autosomal dominant neuro, onco or cardiogenetic diseaseand to their family members via patient organisations(n,379) and to members of the general population via a commercial panel (n ,1000). Results: Attitudes of the patient and population samples generally corresponded. A majority of participants believed that initially only ï¬rst degree relatives should be informed, following the principles of cascade screening. Most parti cipants also thought that patients and healthcare profes sionals (HCPs) should be involved in informing relatives, and a large proportion believed that HCPs should contactrelatives directly when patients are unwilling to inform, for untreatable and treatable conditions. Participants from the patient sample were of the opinion that HCPs shouldactively offer support. Discussion: Ourï¬ndings show that both patients and HCPs should be involved in informing relatives at risk ofautosomal dominant diseases and suggest that relatives â âright to know âwas considered a dominant issue by the majority of participants. Further research is needed on howto more actively inform at risk relatives. L. M. Van den Heuvel: None. D. Stemkens: None. W. Van Zelst Stams: None. F. Willeboordse: None. I. Christiaans: None. C.

Hoogerbrugge1 1Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands,2Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, Netherlands Introduction: In many European countries requesting DNA diagnostics for hereditary breast cancer has tradition ally been the ï¬eld of clinical geneticists. Since test results can now be available within 2 3 weeks, these are increasingly considered for determining treatment optionsin breast cancer patients. Treating physicians therefore increasingly refer eligible, recently diagnosed breast cancer patients for rapid DNA testing to the clinical geneticist. Tofacilitate timely test results, we aimed to shift counseling and requests for rapid DNA diagnostics for these patients from clinical geneticists to treating physicians and evaluatethis transition towards so called âmainstreaming â. Methods: The project was initiated by the departments of Clinical Genetics from Maastricht University MedicalCenter and Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Regional hospitals were included one by 1788one from July 2018 onwards. Treating physicians were asked for their needs and barriers to participate. DNA diagnostics consisted of gene panel analysis for BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2 andATM . Results: In the start up phase, treating physicians requested hands on information, for which the websitewww. DNA ï¬rst.nl was developed. Barriers included time investment during consultation and perceived incompetence of providing breast screening advice for family members. Therefore, clinical geneticists joined multidisciplinary meetings. Up to February 2019, nine hospitals were inclu ded, 65 requests for DNA diagnostics made and threepathogenic mutations found (4.6%) for which patients were referred to a clinical geneticist. Structured evaluation of quality of care and experiences of doctors and patients willfollow shortly.

However, there is scarceinformation regarding the families âcomprehension of microarray results indicative of recurrent chromosomal micro deletion/ duplication ï¬ndings. This is especially true in cases where microarray testing identi ï¬es parents to be carriers of similar chromosomal alterations as their child and where parents may/may not have some clinicalmanifestations of their own. Method: This is a qualitative exploratory study, where semi structured interviews were conducted with fourmothers of children identi ï¬ed to have recurrent chromoso mal micro deletion/duplication syndromes. The interviewswere transcribed verbatim and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: Three superordinate themes emerged from the study: validation of a diagnosis, response to unexpected test results & acceptance patterns and thirdly, impact of results. Conclusion: This study identi ï¬ed that all the parents interviewed valued the genetic diagnosis provided by microarray testing. Acceptance patterns of results differed based on personal family differences. However there stillexisted some uncertainty regarding their child âs future.

31219,"University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom Background Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare inherited condition characterised by a lifetime risk of developing numerous tumours at different sites of the body. The main clinical manifestations include tumours ofthe parathyroid glands, pancreas and anterior pituitary gland. Recent research suggested that female patients with MEN1 might also be at an increased risk of early onsetbreast cancer. Therefore, there is a potential need to introduce early breast screening into the surveillance programme of this group of patients. The purpose of thisstudy was to explore attitudes towards the introduction of additional breast screening among women with MEN1 who were mainly unaware of this risk and already undergoingintensive screening investigations. Methods: Seven women with molecular diagnoses of MEN1 were recruited through Clinical Genetics at theQueen Elizabeth University Hospital (Glasgow). Semi structured qualitative interviews were conducted. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematicanalysis. Results: Three main themes underpinning the attitudes about additional breast screening emerged: positivity, con cern and information needs. All participants were positive about the introduction of additional breast screening. However, a fear of cancer, risk misperceptions and lack ofinformation were identi ï¬ed as major concerns affecting their willingness to be screened. Conclusions: The positive attitude of women with MEN1 supports the feasibility of introducing additional breast screening into the surveillance program of this group of patients. Emphasis should be placed on the risk com munication process in order to facilitate informed decisions alongside maintaining the wellbeing of these patients. A. Esteve Garcia: None.",2019

For instance, while clinicians ask informedconsent for NGS, lab technicians performing DNA sequen cing and analysis do not always know what exactly was consented to. Contrariwise, those who are developingconsent forms and/or performing consent conversations with the patient, require information from all other parties involved in later steps of the NGS process. To elucidate the key steps in the communication between the different parties involved in NGS in health care and clinical research, an expert meeting was organized by theNational Consortium of Ethical, Legal and Social Implica tions of Personalised Medicine (ELSI PM) in the Netherlands. Ideally, it should be clear to all parties what exactly is consented to.

A recent MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) introducing this subject area, and market research has demonstrated the wider demand for skills and knowl edge development in this ï¬eld. Materials and Methods: We used agile processes for course development including user storyboarding, priori tised development sprints and iterative development. We took a reusable approach to development of teaching materials to make them useable in other contexts. Results: Using Laurillard âs conversational framework the course was divided into sections and discussion activities designed. Each section was further divided into learningobjects which were developed iteratively by subject matter experts using a range of teaching approaches. Team meeting were used to prioritise each development sprint. Learningobjects were designed to be non context speci ï¬c and thus reusable: weekly topics were formed by contextualising a series of learning objects using text, videos and interactiveactivities using the Articulate Rise 360 platform. User Acceptance Testing provided feedback on the completed course. Conclusions: This approach has made course develop ment more ï¬exible, easier to manage and innovative.

We provide here an update of the procedure extended to a total of 4272 patients suspectedof HBOC, hereditary colorectal or renal cancers. After the PTI scheduled within 14 days and performed by genetic counselors, a pre genetic counseling ï¬le (including tumour data and status of treatment and number of affected and unaffected ï¬rst and second degree relatives), is established. The PTI is then submitted within 7 days to the routingperformed by a cancer geneticist with 3 possible conclu sions: (i) priority face to face genetic counseling (FTFGC), with a cancer geneticist, if the indication is con ï¬rmed and genetic analyses have potential immediate therapeutic impacts, (ii) non priority FTFGC with genetic counselors if the indication is con ï¬rmed, but genetic analyses have no immediate therapeutic impacts and (iii) non indication for FTFGC.

In this context, we have developed Brecan Risk algorithm, in order to integrate these factors and assess therisk throughout women âs life. Material and Methods: In the ï¬rst phase, the genotypic stratiï¬cation was validated in a cohort of 930 healthy women and 1202 patients, analyzing 120 SNPs related to breast cancer susceptibility from peripheral blood DNA. In the second phase, the algorithm was validated in a cohort of790 women by integrating genotypic and phenotypic data (family history, previous biopsy, breast density, age of menopause, age at ï¬rst pregnancy). In two independent retrospective cohorts followed up for 2 15 years, Bre canRisk was calculated and correlated with breast cancer development. Results: The genotypic analysis separated case control populations and strati ï¬ed them according to the risk based on the genotype phenotype combination. 67% of thewomen were classi ï¬ed as low medium risk (0 1.67) while the remaining 33% were classi ï¬ed as moderate (1.67 2.49) or high risk (>2.49).

Younger asymptomatic siblings of symptomatic SMA patients are usually never tested until adolescence or adultlife. However, following regulatory approval of the ï¬rst tailored treatment for SMA, the prospects for care of these patients have changed as early testing would changeproactive measures and opportunities for these patients. Methods: Different aspects of genetic counseling that could potentially be in ï¬uenced by new advanced therapies are explored. Among them are considered: 1) Risk of recurrence and diagnosis of carriers in the family 2) Reproductive options 3) Phenotypically concordant anddiscordant brothers 4) Prevention levels 5) Predictive genetic markers of disease evolution 6) Early intervention: criteria for neonatal screening and presymptomatic treat ment. Two clinical cases are deeply analyzed. Results: In all the aspects analyzed there were potential substantial changes regarding attitudes and decision making. Of particular relevance is the fact that at present the SMA would ful ï¬ll the total of the 10 criteria of Wilson and Jungner to be considered a candidate disease for neo natal screening. Conclusions: The approval of effective advanced thera pies is changing the way in which the communication andgenetic counseling is assumed in SMA.

Ideally,counselees are fully informed about uncertainties to make an informed decision about whether or not to perform such a test. It is presently unknown whether and how uncertaintyis discussed during initial cancer genetic counseling. We therefore investigated in which counselors discuss uncer tainty concerning multigene panel tests, address counselees â uncertainties, and whether their manner is associated with counselors âcharacteristics. Materials and Methods: Videotapes were made of counselors discussing a multigene panel test with a simu lated patient (SP). SPs represented a counselee who had had multiple cancer types. Before and after their consultation,counselors completed a survey. Counselors âuncertainty expressions, initiative and framing of expressions, and counselors âverbal responses to SP âs scripted uncertainty expressions were coded. Results: Counselors (N ,29) expressed uncertainties mainly regarding scienti ï¬c topics (94%) and on their own initiative (95%). Most expressions were framed directly (77%; e.g. We don ât know ), and non valenced (59%; i.e. without a positive or negative value). After SPs expresseduncertainties, counselors mainly responded by explicitly referring to the uncertainty (69%) without providing space for further disclosure (66%). More experience with geneticcounseling led to a decrease in space for further disclosure of SPs âuncertainties ( p<.02). Conclusions: Mainly communicating scienti ï¬c uncer tainties, and using mostly space reducing responses, raises the question whether enough attention is paid to counselees â personal uncertainties allowing them to disclose their con cerns during initial genetic counseling.

While genomic data accumulates at a very fast pace, itsavailability and the speci ï¬cs of the local genetic landscape are among main challenges encountered by the biomedical or clinical geneticist. We present our preliminary data onthe implementation of whole exome sequencing (WES) technology as a clinical investigation tool in our Romanian patients. Materials and Methods: Twenty two patients with neurological, metabolic, cardiac, and skin disorders were referred to our laboratory for WES or panel sequencingbetween June 2017 January 2019. Ion GeneStudio S5 System (Thermo Fisher Scienti ï¬c) and Ion Reporter plat form were used. Results: Eleven pathogenic or likely pathogenic muta tions associated with part of/complete clinical phenotypes were found in ACADS, ACADVL, ALOX12B, AP4B1, APOE, GJB6, IQSEC2, PHKB, TBCK genes. 3 VOUS in ACADVL, GK, KCNMA genes possibly causative for the clinical presentations of patients were also described. Thus,mutations explaining the patients âphenotypes were found in 7 cases, indicating an overall detection rate of 30.43%; in 2 more cases only part of the phenotype was clari ï¬ed. Conclusions: Genetic diagnosis is becoming increasingly accessible throughout the Western world. However, small, local clinics beyond this geographical space encounterspeciï¬c challenges when embarking in WES, such as the genetic particularities of the local populations, the need to establish an open dialogue within multidisciplinary medicalteams, competition with larger Western companies and, quite often, the lack of patient ï¬nancial assistance from local health insurance systems.

Like the other monogenic diseases, X linked disordersare categorized into dominant and recessive. In order to teach about this inheritance pattern of diseases, it has been created a memory game, which the main purpose was toinform, in a playful way, their characteristics. Materials and Methods: This memory game contains 24 cards, split in 12 pairs. Each pair has a card with informa tive text and another with an illustrative ï¬gure about the corresponding text. The game needs two players that will use memory and logic capacities. As the game progresses,the player must use memory to store information contained in the card and his position in the game, winning the player that achieves a larger number of correct pairs. Results: We used eight players, divided into four pairs. They had a few knowledge about the subject and, during the game, were correlating the texts with the ï¬gures. In the end, the players were able to correctly relate the information contained in the cards with the respective ï¬gures. Conclusion: The memory game proved to be ef ï¬cient in acquiring knowledge about the theme, brought in a playful and easy to learn way. By relating the information con tained in the texts with the images, the players presented agreater understanding about the features of X linked diseases. N. T. SimÃµes: None. M. B. Reis: None. S.

In 50 60% of cases, SRS is caused by an epimutation of theregion 11p15. Currently, no studies have been published on the assessment of cognitive, psychological and behavioral particularities of adults with SRS. Methods: An evaluation of cognitive and psychosocial proï¬le was performed in 11 patients (7 men), aged 18 to 39 years (M ,24.36 years). All patients had an epimutation of the region 11p15 IGF2/H19 region. Ten patients had a bachelor âs degree and 7 completed a higher education. 70% were treated with growth hormone and 90% have bene ï¬ted from speech therapy and/or psychological care. Results: Mean overall IQ score was 95.82 (17.65 SD). Verbal comprehension index was on average higher thanother indexes (mean 109.55; 18.17 SD). We have found a trend link between birth weight and Processing Speed Index and between birth head circumference and PerceptualReasoning Index. The abilities to concentrate were con sidered very low (score below 84) in 4 patients. Self esteem was also very low (score below 33) in 4 patients. Inter nalizing problems score was higher in SRS group than in the normative control group (p ,0.032). Conclusion: Overall adults with SRS had normal intel lectual ef ï¬ciency.

Lifestyle change can improve health prospects dramatically,but executing the change requires ï¬rm motivation. Our 18 month lifestyle intervention, âEffects of ApoE4 genotype information and intervention intensity on the ful ï¬lment of lifestyle changes and sensory preferences (ApoE4mot) â, assessed the effect of genetic risk information ( APOE É4 carrier status) on the motivation for lifestyle change. Materials and Methods: We recruited 211 healthy adult volunteers from Ostrobothnia (Finland), genotyped them for APOE É4carrier status (carrier vs. non carrier) and com municated the results to the intervention group. The parti cipants ï¬lled in questionnaires on lifestyle choices, food preferences and psychological state. Their lifestyle statuswas documented by physiological measurements and plasma values (cholesterol, blood glucose, fatty acid composition etc.). Results: 35.6% of the individuals had at least one É4 allele. LDL and total cholesterol levels were lower in those with APOE Îµ2than those with APOE Îµ3and Îµ4(p<0.05). However, in those with Îµ2, the proportions of 18:2n 6 and total polyunsaturated fatty acids, for example, were lower than in those with Îµ4, and 16:0 and total saturated fatty acids higher (p<0.05). Conclusions: The plasma fatty acid differences may result from genetic differences in the fatty acid metabolismbetween the APOE genotypes, or, excepting the cholesterol values, the slightly better lifestyles of the APOE É4carriers, suggesting better health awareness.

How patients perceive uncertainty is in ï¬uenced by how providers convey it. Communication theories about managing uncertain health information include provider messaging. To assess the state of the science, we conducteda systematic literature review on communication of uncertain health risk information across specialties. Our aims were to assess the breadth and quality of the evidence,identify research gaps and posit evidence based hypotheses. The search identi ï¬ed 1020 abstracts from PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Communication Source and CochraneReviews published between 1/1/1990 and 6/1/2018. Forty one met inclusion criteria: 16 quantitative and 25 qualitative studies. A total of 3656 providers and 4530 patients wererepresented. Among the quantitative studies, one was of high quality an intervention study to enhance effective communication of uncertainty. Nine were moderate qualityobservational studies. Seven were self report of lower quality. Among 25 qualitative studies, 12 were analyses of recorded clinical sessions of high quality, ten were self report interviews, three were focus groups and one was an ethnographic study. Communication and management of clinical uncertainties were observed or reported betweenproviders and patients in primary care, advanced cancer care, genetics, obstetrics, oncology, cardiology, and emer gency medicine. Research gaps exist in interventionresearch. Evidence revealed providers âavoidance of com municating clinical uncertainties, recognition of challenges in communicating uncertainties, decisions to provideinformation over uncertainties, and relational factors that led to expressions of uncertainty; all generating hypothesesto be tested.

Across the genomicsresearch literature there are myriad studies using a plethora of psychological terms, not always consistently. As well as the terminology utilised, the tools employed to measurethese states also vary. This review examined the usage and measurement of âemotional distress âin the context of genetic testing. Methods: This systematic review followed the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) framework and MED LINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were searched. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) framework was used to report results followed by a quality scoring analysis. Search termsincluded âemotional distress â,âpsychological distress âand âgene* â. Qualitative thematic analysis was conducted and tools used within the included studies were quantitativelytabulated. Results: The review included 13 papers, incorporating 16 tools.

31235,"Division of Primary Care, Nottingham, United Kingdom Introduction: Recent scienti ï¬c advances have led to genomic testing being mainstreamed into clinical practice. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in the change in health related behaviour after patients receive agenomic test result. Leventhal âs Self regulation model is one of the frameworks used in this area. According to this theory, the genomic test result (external stimulus) wouldchange the patient âs mental representation about health threats. Recent evidence suggests that simply acquiring new information about one âs risk to develop a certain condition might not be enough for patients to change their lifestyle (Hollands et al., 2016). Therefore, we will also be interested to ascertain if taking part in the study might in ï¬uence the intention to change particular behaviours (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1982). Our aim is to explore patients âexperiences of genomic testing for Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and understand what factors may explain their readiness to adopt (or not) a healthier lifestyle. Materials and Methods: We will report a mixed methods approach that evaluates patients receiving differ ent types of FH genomic test results. Quantitative data willbe generated through a questionnaire that includes measures of anxiety, beliefs and perceived control over heart disease and stages of change for smoking cessation and exercise. Qualitative data will be collected through semi structured interviews and the framework model will be used in the analysis. Conclusion: Following the example of FH, we will explore how genomic testing in primary care might be used as a potential intervention to empower patients to adopthealthier lifestyle behaviours. L.

To assess whether genomic testing should beimplemented on a population scale, and to ensure effective research translation, evidence is required on the psycholo gical and ethical implications of this approach. Theperspectives of main stakeholders, such as the public, are key to understanding these implications. Methods: Semi structured interviews were undertaken with 30 participants (24 69 years, 50% female) recruited from a pilot trial in which they received personalised mel anoma genomic risk information. We explored participants â psychological responses to receiving this information and their views on broader ethical considerations of offering genomic risk information to the population. Data wereanalysed thematically. Results: Many participants described positive responses to receiving genomic risk information, including feelingreassured. Some reported short term negative emotional reactions that dissipated over time. Their responses were linked to: expectations for their risk result, disease riskperception, existing preventive behaviours and their risk results. Participants raised ethical considerations of population scale genomic testing including: consequencesfor individual responsibility for disease prevention, possible adverse responses due to perceptions of genetic exception alism, implications for parental responsibilities and poten tial discrimination. Participants felt that trust, choice and equity should be taken into account in the provision of population scale genomic testing. Conclusions: Personalised melanoma genomic risk information alongside education and lifestyle counselling is1798favourably received by the public with minimal negative responses.

Management of the information on HD in familieshas been scarcely reported, from a transgenerational perspective. This study aims to get a deeper understanding of the management of information about the disease, withinPortuguese HD families, and its implications for family and social relationships. This is an exploratory qualitative study, using a semi structured interview with persons from HD families. Ten participants were recruited: two carriers, eight non carriers. Interviews were transcribed and submitted to themeanalysis. Information from genetic diagnosis and the potential for presymptomatic testing represent a turning point for HDfamily members, with a high impact for management of the information about the disease within the family. After a diagnosis of HD, families tend to identify possibly affectedrelatives (in previous and present generations) and question who may develop it in the future. Through this process, families i) travel into their past, to re/build the history of the disease in the family; and ii) build a new consciousness about HD and its hereditary character. Family members use different approaches to deal with HD in the family and inthe community: either closure (denial, silence, secrecy) or openness (open disclosure). Outcomes from theseapproaches range from isolation, challenging stigma, and normalizing the disease experience. These results may be relevant for genetic counselling practice, bringing further insight into transgenerational processes of management of the information about HD in families.

NIPT allows to improvethe detection of CA of a fetus and reduce the number of unwarranted invasive procedures. Healthcare professionals, HPs, in Europe are ready to use NIPT as a ï¬rst or second line test due to its safety, high sensitivity and early results. However, there were found country speci ï¬c differences in choosing methods for FTS, depending on ethnic, socio demographic and religious characteristics of respondents, as well as the local health policy related to the need for partial or full payment of prenatal tests and the availability ofabortion. Accordingly, each country requires its own guidelines, developed with taking into account the social context. Methods: Our group conducted the sociological survey among 37 HPs. The questionnaire included questions about preferences for FTS, demographic attributes and a discretechoice experiment. Results: For Russian HPs, most signi ï¬cant attributes of prenatal tests are their cost, the justi ï¬cation of invasive procedures and the possibility of obtaining the mostAbstracts from the 52ndEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG). . . 1799complete information.

Prenatal screening tests may have positive or negative effects for women. In this study, we are looking at thepsychological effects of prenatal screening tests for the fetus. Materials and Methods: A sample of 162 women who had genetic counselling sessions regarding prenatal tests completed the Pro ï¬le of Mood States (POMS) short form before the prenatal test and after they received the result. The Pro ï¬le of Mood States (POMS) is a psychological rating scale used to assess transient, distinct mood states such as Tension or Anxiety, Anger or Hostility, Vigor orActivity, Fatigue or Inertia, Depression or Dejection, Con fusion or Bewilderment. Results: Most cases showed slightly higher score in Tension or Anxiety, Confusion or Bewilderment category before the prenatal tests. The score was decreased after they received the test result but some showed repressive andpunitive attitudes at the session. Six women showed medically disturbed mood in spite of negative result for NIPT. Conclusions: Testing the fetus make some impact on pregnant women and the partner even with negative result. The study showed prenatal tests make them slight moodchange within expected range in many cases. It was very helpful to ï¬nd some medically disturbed women throughthis study since they didn ât show any speci ï¬c symptoms.

Identi ï¬cation of variants allows family screening, provided that relatives have been previously informed accordingly to a2013 French decree. We wanted to assess the effective transmission of genetic information to relatives and the impact of the diagnosis disclosure, and show a possible linkbetween vEDS experiencing and ability to communicate the genetic information. vEDS adult probands answered a questionnaire during a clinical visit. Transmission ofinformation to relatives was considered effective if the proband gave information to some or all relatives and easily realized if it was done less than a month, withoutdifï¬culties, to all relatives. Personal and family aspects of probands regarding their vEDS experience were also assessed. Effective transmission of information to relativeswas remarkably high (98%). Siblings were the most frequently informed (82%). This process seemed simple to perform (58%) but worrying (44%). Women (89%) seemedto inform their relatives more quickly than men (59%). There was no difference in the information of relatives before and after 2013, meaning that regular multidisciplin ary support of patients fosters transmission of information. Regarding vEDS experience, patients felt anxiety (78%) at diagnosis disclosure and considered this diagnosis as thepossibility to start a medical follow up (82%) ; Most of probands with children (56%) felt guilty about vEDS transmission to offspring. The ability to easily communicateinformation seemed to be mainly related to the relief felt during vEDS diagnosis disclosure.1800J. Mazzella: None. S. Adham: None. M. Frank: None. X.

However, given that genomics is both a fringe and highly complex subject, there is a big risk of misinforma tion, misunderstanding and general distrust in society. Methods: Different initiatives have been launched to organize the societal debate on ethical, legal and societal issues (ELSI) in genomics. We will focus on in depthqualitative data from a Belgian citizen forum (32 citizens, 3 weekends) and a French public consultation (22 citizens, 4 weekends) in 2018. Results: On the one hand, genomic research can bene ï¬t everyone and scienti ï¬c progress is a common good. On the other hand, the individual and potentially the individual âs family is at risk when certain mutations are discovered or data is misused. In the public âs understanding, genes are linked to identity, irreversible traits, the ânature âof an individual. Both risks and bene ï¬ts regarding genomics touch an intimate part of individuals âprivate lives. This tension is not alleviated through societal debate, but dis cussions between citizens can inform researchers and policy makers about different perspectives in society and potential reactions to certain information, requests, policies andprojects. In turn, well organized debates enhance public awareness and understanding of ELSI in genomics. We describe different approaches to societal debates and theiroutcomes.

In the ï¬rst study, data were collected on how genetic information should be used in criminal trials. Results from the International Genetic Literacy and Attitudes Survey (iGLAS, N ,3981) showed marked variation in views. For example, 62% of participants felt that genetic information should inform sentencing, whereas 29% felt that it should not be considered. 6% felt a highgenetic risk for aggression should reduce the defendant âs sentence; and 3% felt it should increase it. In the second study, participants considered whether family membershave a right to information about a close relative âs genetic condition (based on ABC vs the NHS). Data were collected several times as additional information was provided toparticipants. The results revealed highly polarised views. Some participants resolutely supported familial rights to access information about their relative âs diagnosis and that the NHS should be legally obliged to provide this. Other participants steadfastly supported the patient's right to conï¬dentiality and non disclosure, even though this might have health implications for their relatives. Participants who either had a genetic condition themselves or in their family favoured disclosure. Sex differences also emerged.

Also we asked what is the attitude of respondents to perform genetic testing for BRCA1 / BRCA2 / BRAX without a family history ofcancer. 25.9% of respondents do not have any knowledge about such tests and 90.3% of doctors replied that such a study would have a positive impact. Unfortunately doctorsdo not know how to properly collect samples (82,5%) and what documents to ï¬ll in to correctly carry out the proce dure (43,3%). Conclusions: The opinion on genetic testing among Poles is very positive. There is a great need to increase the availability of prenatal and other genetics tests in Poland. Itseems very necessary to expand the knowledge of both patients and physicians on subject of genetic research. M. A. Malarska: None. P. M. Pachniak: None. A. Mazerant: None. E. M. Borkowska: None. M.

31244,"Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Safe and effective clinical application of human germline gene editing (GLGE) is becoming more feasible, as gene editing techniques are being improved. This provides a real prospect of curative treatment for serious (mono)genetic diseases. However, human GLGE may also be used to prevent disease, as in He Jiankui âs experiment, and to enhance humanity. There is general consensus that human GLGE should be democraticallygoverned, meaning that all stakeholders should be involved in determining the purposes and boundaries of the technology. Therefore, a public dialogue will be organized in the Netherlands to provide information, encourage active participation, and to assemble various stakeholders âopi nions. We aim to investigate the impact of this humanGLGE dialogue on public opinions. Method: This study was piloted among 28 students who ï¬lled in a survey on attitudes towards human GLGE before and after a ten weeks minor course. Results: Student de ï¬nitions of germline editing were signiï¬cantly more correct after the minor period compared to before (p<0.01). Attitudes towards GLGE shifted equally towards both directions between pre and post measurement. Proponents perceived GLGE to be more promising (p<.01)and hopeful (p<.05) and judged the odds of the best case scenario to occur as greater (p<.01) compared to opponents. Conclusions: Increased knowledge does not imply a more positive attitude towards human GLGE. Our data indicates that especially factors related to trust and affect may in ï¬uence attitudes towards GLGE. Together these ï¬ndings support the presumption that organizing a public dialogue will enable public deliberation without in ï¬uencing public opinion. D. Houtman: None. S. Riedijk: None. B.

Broadsheet newspapers are one of the public âs main source of information on such scienti ï¬c topics. We analysed all articles about predictive genetictesting published in The Guardian and the Daily Telegraph between 2011 and 2016. Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress and a review of scienti ï¬c literature served as a starting point for the deductive analysis. The analysis was qualitative with semi quantitative aspects. We found that issues related to theprinciples of bene ï¬cence and autonomy were covered more than aspects regarding the principles of justice and nonmale ï¬cence. More speci ï¬cally, the medical bene ï¬ts of predictive genetic testing were preferred in newspaper coverage over its potential harms. Many ethical issues were1802not portrayed in their full complexity, and there was a lack of coverage regarding the autonomy related issues Right not to know and Incidental ï¬ndings . With direct to consumer genetic testing on the rise, the ethical issues regarding predictive genetic testing are highly signi ï¬cant for society.

The aim of this presentation is to examine how actual risk estimates correlate with perceived risk and howgenetic knowledge is related to these estimates. Participants of FinHealth 2017 study received a pro ï¬le based on clinical and self reported measures. The pro ï¬le included risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and risk for developing coronary heart disease (CHD) in the next 10 years. After receiving the health pro ï¬le, 3384 participants consented to P5 study to receive genetic and metabolomic risk information. Those who consented to study answered questions related to genetic knowledge and perceived riskfor CHD and T2D. At the baseline, 19% of men in age group 50 59 had increased risk (>10%) for CHD and 71% in oldest agegroup 60 69, respectively among women 2% and 17%. In the youngest age group (30 39) only 4% and at least moderate risk for T2D, while 33% were in that groupamong 60 69 years old males, respectively among women 11% and 40% had at least moderate risk. Only 10% of all P5 respondents reported their risk to be high for CHD,while 33% reported their risk to be at least moderate for T2D. Genetic knowledge was weakly related to perceived T2D risk (r , .05,p,.023) and CHD risk (r , .06,p,.017).Respondents âperceived risks were strongly related to actual risk estimates.

31247,"ogy such as CRISPR Cas9 is essential for at least two mainreasons. First, surveying the general public aims at under standing people âs attitudes and orientations about genome editing which are relevant as they should inform, in someways, further public engagement, scienti ï¬c research and policy. Second, it simultaneously educates the general public about the surveyed matter and drives people âs attention on the subject in a chosen way. Surveying on any subject, no matter how âmerely descriptive âthe explicit goal of the survey is, always comes as a selection of whathas to be considered relevant, why and how. In order for such surveys to not be (too) biased and to increase the knowledge about genome editing, they therefore need tofollow a structured design and rigorous methodology. We analyzed the only 8 surveys on genome editing published worldwide in the last four years and fully dedicated to thissubject and here present the comparative analysis of their main strengths and weaknesses. We noticed that the research design often tends to be identi ï¬ed as the statistical sample selection process and that âs why we fear this might weaken the heuristic range of the research itself.

C. Mayeur Sciensano, Brussels, Belgium Introduction: We compare some of the main results of a Belgian citizen forum (2018) on the use of genomic information, with related recommendations of international professional societies, such as the European Society ofHuman Genetics. Materials and Methods: At the request of the Minister of Public Health, we organized a panel of 32 citizens,selected to ensure maximal diversity. During three week ends, they debated and re ï¬ected on the ethical, legal and societal issues surrounding the use of genomic information,supported by experts of different backgrounds. Results: Among the many needs and opinions expressed by citizens, we focus on one key message. Citizens supportgenomic data sharing for the common good, which they deï¬ne as scienti ï¬c research that improves knowledge (on both prevention and diagnostics) to build a fair societywhere everyone has an equal opportunity to live healthy. However, their support hinges on three conditions: 1) No genetic discrimination: a person should not be a prisoner of his/her genetic makeup 2) Privacy protection: the genome is an unique and intimate part of the individual that warrants protection 3) Individual control: transparency, traceability and decision making As genomics grows more and more important, it will impact the lives of many citizens. However, recommenda tions of international professional societies are based on expert opinion. We investigate whether the principles underlying these recommendations are in line with fundamental values in society. Conclusion: Professional recommendations should be informed by fundamental values and needs of citizens. C. Mayeur: None.",2019

The prognosis is more uncertain when the CNV is inherited from a healthy parent. Here we present two cases of prenatal diagnosis of 1q21.1 deletion with oppositepregnancy issues. The ï¬rst case is a second pregnancy of healthy parents. During the second trimester US examina tion the AVSD was detected. The amniocentesis wasperformed and array CGH showed 2,6 Mb deletion including GJA5 and GJA8 , inherited by the father.

Results: Positive attitude were found toward predictive genetic testing. A majority of participants (77.4%) would like to know whether they at risk of developing diseases. Moreover, about 65% of participant would like to test their newborn child to learn which diseases they may develop in adulthood. Most respondents (71.2%) are agreed that cou ples planning a pregnancy should have a possibility to have a carrier test. Only 20% of respondents agreed that carrier screening for speci ï¬c diseases will lead to an inferior image of people with these disorders.

The numerous ethical issues on both sides of the debate refer not only to the psychological, emotional and social impact of the decision making, butalso raise the question regarding the cognitive capacities of the children in their different developmental stages and their right to autonomy. The controversy of testing in minorswhere there is no medical bene ï¬t in the immediate future needs to be challenged once again, given the current perspective of the latest trials that cast a vision upon thepossibility of tangible treatments.

31251,"1King Faisal Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 2king Saud bin Abdulaziz university, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Introduction: The genetics domain is witnessing great advances in diagnosing and predicting genetic diseases. Ina clinical setting, autosomal recessive genetic disorders are frequently observed as a result of the high rate of consanguinity. The advances in genomic technologies inrecent years have facilitated new tools for gene discovery in humans. Such approaches have already proven to be beneï¬cial for the identi ï¬cation of the genetic causes of several Mendelian disorders. There is a debate over the ethical dilemmas behind providing families with the genetic test results and incidental ï¬ndings identi ï¬ed by the whole exome sequencing. Thus, this vast source of information can have a multitude of ethical and social implications both for patients and healthcare providers. In this study we aim tostudy how families of affected children respond when they receive incidental ï¬ndings. Also we aim to identify how healthcare professionals working within genetic counselingï¬elds descriptively abide by their role and the information sharing procedures. Methods: This study was qualitative conducted at King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh. It included a total of fourteen parents, and a total of fourteen healthcare providers working with children diagnosed with genetic diseases. Results and conclusion: In this study six strong themes emerged. This study explored the experiences of parents of children affected with genetic diseases at the time ofreceiving the incidental ï¬ndings. It also explored the experiences of the healthcare providers attending these families. References: Abbort, Madue E. ""The Evolution of Mod ern Medicine.""

31252,"Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) is a new type ofin vitro fertilization that aims to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases (matrilineal transmission) byreplacing mutated mitochondrial DNA in unfertilized oocytes or zygotes with normal mitochondria from a healthy donor. Since as a result of MRT, permanentchanges are made to the germline that would be transmitted through generations, this controversially so called âthree parent IVF âcan be considered as a means of genetic modiï¬cation. Besides the UK, which became the ï¬rst country to approve MRT in 2015, only a few countries have addressed MRT through public policy. In order to explorehow the interdependence of ethics, policy, and public views can address questions that arise from new reproductive technologies and analyze the in ï¬uence of sociocultural factors upon stakeholders âmotives for using MRT, we conducted a systematic literature review analysis of relevant academic sources according to Oxford âs Bodleian Libraries review guidelines. Next, we reviewed and assessed pertinent legislation, policies, and ethical guidelines, in both the research and clinical contexts, in Canada, the US,the UK, and Mexico whose approaches in governing this controversial technique range from strict bans with serious consequences to an absence of policy. The major themesidenti ï¬ed in our review included, safety and ef ï¬cacy, concerns over germline modi ï¬cation, issues of identity, concerns over three genetic contributors, and distributivejustice.

One issue of information aboutgenetic risk is reproductive decision making. The aim was to compare attitudes in different neurogenetic diseases such as Huntington disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Myotonic dystrophy and assess evolution for Huntington disease since 2000. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was distributed since June 2018. Results: We analysed 370 completed questionnaires (200 HD, 81 SCAs, 56 DM1, 28 ALS, 5 CJD). Affected indi viduals were 34.9%, spouses 27.6%, at risks persons 21% and premanifest carriers 10.1%, or non carriers 6.5%. Meanage at response was 56.5Â± 15.5 (18 85), signi ï¬cantly older in ataxias (p<0.001). Only 12.5% knew about the French law, stipulating obligatory information, but 66.6% said theydid inform offspring. 37% wished having children, their family disease inter fered: 85% declared their disease justi ï¬ed prenatal or pre implantation diagnosis, 67% to interrupt a future pregnancy. Disease gravity estimated by the participant was positively correlated to turn to preimplantation diagnosis (p<0.01). Between 2000 and 2019 participants had been informed about their risk earlier (33.8Â±13.2 years versus 28.8Â±14.9 p<0.05); they were informed more often by parents, 13.8%versus 51.2%; less by clinicians, 36.6% versus 18.2%; by other family members 20.7% versus 14.0% and not directly, 23.4% versus 16.5% (p<0.001) and testing before the age of18 was considered positively in 13.8% versus 30.1% (p<0.005).

Isidor1 1CHU Nantes, nantes, France,2CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France,3CHU Rennes, Rennes, France As use of high throughput sequencing is rapidly growing in the clinical setting, vital questions need to be raised over the most appropriate course of action regarding the activesearch for disease causing variants extraneous to the clinical question. Although the American College of Genetics and Genomics recommends a list of these secondary ï¬ndings be identi ï¬ed in all patients, other professional bodies are not in agreement, a view which we share for several reasons. First, as we discuss, the use of actionability as the criterion fordetermining whether or not to report secondary ï¬ndings is problematic, particularly as it is currently lacking a clear, precise and widely agreed upon de ï¬nition. Second, the question remains as to how bene ï¬cial the knowledge of these variants is to individuals âhealth, particularly given the uncertainty associated with the pathogenicity of some of thevariants. We suggest it is critical that reasonable choices concerning the release of data resulting from high throughput sequencing are made and that it is appropriateto wait for a consensus among scientists on the pathogeni city and clinical utility of disclosing secondary ï¬ndings before integrating this into sequencing practices in theclinical setting.

An on line survey explored the experiences of consumers applying for a range of risk rated insurance products whohad had predictive genetic testing 2010 2016 and asympto matic at the time of application. Recruitment was conducted through Australian support groups and research organisa tions. 67/79 respondents at risk for one or more of 76 conditions were valid for analysis. Of the 31/67 who applied for travel insurance after genetic testing, seven[hereditary breast/ovarian cancer HBOC (4), cardiovas cular (2), neuromuscular (1)] reported being charged higher premiums (1) or refusal (5) with the reasons cited as havinga pre existing condition. Another respondent at risk for HBOC reported high anxiety that she had answered ânoâto the pre existing question and may have dif ï¬culties claiming if she developed breast cancer. An audit of application forms for travel insurance available in Australia found none included any reference to positive genetic test results as acriterion that meets the de ï¬nition of a âPre Existing Medical Condition â. While limitations of the survey methodology prevent con ï¬rmation of their asymptomatic status, there is the potential that these consumers inferred themselves that they had the condition as a result of their test. This emphasizes the need for clear guidelines for providers oftravel insurance, education of consumers as to the meaning of their test result and of the importance of the language used by professionals when returning the result.

31256,"1Middlesex University, London, United Kingdom,2EURAC, Bolzano, Italy,3Lund University, Lund, Sweden,4Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in May 2018. The aspiration of providing for a high level of protection to individuals âpersonal data, risked placing considerable constraints on scienti ï¬c research, that was contrary to various research traditions across the EU. Therefore, along with the set of carefully outlined datasubjects ârights, the GDPR also provides for a two level framework to enable derogations from these rights when scienti ï¬c research is concerned. First, by directly invoking provisions of the GDPR on a condition that safeguards that must include âtechnical and organisational measures âare in place. Second and in addition to that, through the MemberState law. Although these derogations are allowed in the name of scienti ï¬c research, they can simultaneously be seen as challenging in light of the ethical requirements and long existed protection standards in biobanking that have been set forth in various research related soft legal tools, international treaties and other legal instruments. In thispaper we review such soft legal tools, international treaties and other legal instruments that regulate the use of health research data. We report on the results of this review, andanalyse the rights contained within the GDPR and Article 89 of the GDPR vis Ã vis these instruments. These instruments were also reviewed to provide guidance onpossible safeguards that should be followed when imple menting any derogations.

31257,"1Public Health Genomics, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia,2University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia Introduction: Historically, Australian life insurance com panies have been permitted to use genetic test results of any kind in life insurance underwriting, and legally discriminate on that basis. Despite international trends towards banningor restricting this practice, the Australian insurance industry has, until recently, opposed any restriction of access to applicants âgenetic results. This has resulted in the deterred uptake of clinical genetic testing and reduced participation in medical research, and has compromised progress in genomic medicine for Australia (Tiller et al, Front. PublicHealth, 2018). Methods: In 2016, the Australian Genetic Non Discrimination Working Group formed to address issuesof genetic discrimination in Australia, especially in life insurance. Over the past 2 years, we undertook research, lobbied government, and gave evidence at public hearingsfor a national Parliamentary Inquiry. We also appeared in the media and surveyed hundreds of Australians with1808genetic mutations about their experiences of insurance discrimination. Results: The survey data we collected indicated a wide spread issue, based on consumer reported breaches of cur rent policy by insurance companies. In early 2018, the Parliamentary Inquiry recommended an urgent ban on usinggenetic results in life insurance underwriting. In late 2018, the peak insurance industry body (Financial Services Council) proposed a moratorium to commence in mid 2019. Conclusion: Achieving a moratorium on the use of genetic test results in Australian life insurance underwriting was a concerted effort requiring the cooperation of numer ous groups and individuals and signi ï¬cant time and resource commitments. This case study is highly relevant for all jurisdictions considering these issues. J. M. Tiller: None. M. Otlowski: None. P. Lacaze: None.",2019

At the same time, the results of genomic studies require legal protection. For the purpose of legal protectionof the genomic research results, it is necessary to apply the mechanisms used in the ï¬eld of intellectual property that meet international standards. Materials and Methods: The aim of the study was to improve a legal basis for protection of the results of geno mic research. A method for analyzing the doctrine, judicialpractice, comparative legal methods, as well as the method of legal modeling were used. The speci ï¬c mechanisms were proposed to protect the results of genomic research. Results: To protect the results of genomic research in the Russian legal system, the legal regime of copyright, patent law, as well as trade secrets can be applied.

31261,"Introduction: Economic cost of cancer care could be improved via the implementation of precision medicine. The aims of this study is to i) determine the costs andhospital utilisation by childhood cancer patient through current practice; and ii) develop a microsimulation model to evaluate the cost and bene ï¬t from applying next generation sequencing (NGS) in the management of childhood cancer. The model will be ï¬exible to allow for updating input parameters in future. Materials and Methods: We used linked datasets of children under 18 year of age, living in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, who have had cancer as base population. Their records were extracted from the NSW Central Cancer Registry and were linked to mortality database and the hospital datasets. Individual patient âs hospital services usage was determined from the hospital datasets. The simulation will mainly focus on actionable variants identi ï¬ed, and change in management due to the NGS result. The simulation will be benchmarked against the current evi dence, and sensitivity analysis will be performed. Results: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, neuroblastoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma, accounted for 30% of the reported cases. The annual cost of hospitalisation was $ 114,000. Early diagnosis and treatment before the cancerspread are critical drivers to lower costs and hospital utili sation. In our simulation model, 40% of the patients would be diagnosed with actionable variants. Conclusions: We have successfully determined the baseline cost of caring for childhood cancer. Our micro simulation model will allow us to simulate the impact ofNGS on costs and patients âcare. O. Tan: None. D. Scho ï¬eld:None. R. Shrestha: None.",2019

Colonoscopy is one of the most1810effective methods of screening for CRC. Uptake of colonoscopy is suboptimal, and many countries lack a national screening programme. Our study aims at identify ing and ranking the factors contributing to a positive decision to participate in colonoscopy screening in a sample population at risk, in order to inform psychosocialinterventions, such as genetic counselling. Method: The study included 98 individuals aged over 50 years, recruited from senior centres in Romania. Measuresincluded socio demographic variables, frequency of colo noscopy, previous recommendations for screening and preventive measures, health literacy and family history ofcancer. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to establish the discriminative value for each variable between positive and negative decision for colo noscopy screening. Area Under Curve (AUC) coef ï¬cients and effect size parameters were calculated. Results: 23.5% participants reported previous colono scopy screening. ROC curve analysis shows that colono scopy uptake is best discriminated by perceived bene ï¬ts of screening (AUC ,0.711, d ,0.787, p ,0.001), previous recommendations for screening (AUC ,0.689, d ,0.697, p,0.007) and previous recommendations for preventive measures (AUC ,0.675, d ,0.642, p ,0.011). Conclusions: Results show that recommendations from healthcare professionals towards colonoscopy adherence and preventive measures and highlighting the bene ï¬ts of screening were associated with improved colonoscopy uptake. These results can further inform genetic counselling sessions by bringing empirical evidence to emphasizescreening recommendations in individuals at risk for CRC. A. Ciuca: None. S. Pintea: None. A.

Which elements of a genetictest are important to them: do they want to know all results, whatever they are? Under what conditions? HealthEconomics, thought discrete choice experiments (DCEs), allows to reveal and analyze individual and societal preferences for genetic testing. Here, we will present two studies we conducted in France. They illustrate how Health Economics can investigate the value of genetic information and apprehend the diffusion of genomic technologies. Materials and Methods: SEQUAPRE investigated individual preferences . 513 parents of children with rare diseases who would bene ï¬t from NGS were surveyed. PRESAGE investigated societal preferences . 2501 respondents representative of the French population were surveyed. In each study, DCE was aimed to investigatepreferences as regard to different characteristics that can describe a genetic test such as nature and cost of the results. Econometric analysis investigated the presence of pre ference heterogeneity. Results: They stressed how genetic information is valued from individual and societal perspectives and the hetero geneities among respondents: the value of uncertain and secondary results, the role of the clinician in the decision making process, the willingness to pay for the test. Conclusions: In the context of âPlan MÃ©decine France GÃ©nomique 2025 â, our results show the importance to understand individual and societal preferences to favour thediffusion of the technology.

In total 15 IFs (0.1%) were detected in tier 1, mainly in the gene panel including all OMIM genes. As expected, the risk of IFs in the second tier is higher: 85 IFs were detected in 5,358 analyses (1.6%). For some diseases,this 1.6% chance of an IF is even higher than the chance of a positive diagnosis. Only 58 of these 85 IFs were located in the 59 medically actionable genes reported by the AmericanCollege of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), indicating that in our diagnostic setting there is 1.0% chance ofï¬nding a pathogenic variant in one of the ACMG genes. This number differs 2.5 fold from the incidence of secondary ï¬ndings (deliberate analysis of available data) in these genes in our population (incidence 2.6%, Haer Wigman et al. EJHG (2019)). Strikingly, one third of the IFs reported by us are located in genes that are not on the ACMG gene list.

However, the current health economic evidencebase to support widespread adoption and reimbursement is very limited. Aim: To undertake the ï¬rst cost effectiveness analysis of ES for suspected monogenic disorders in comparison with usual diagnostic care, incorporating forecasting of both patient and family outcomes over a 20 year horizon. Methods: A cohort of 80 infants who underwent ES and usual diagnostic care in parallel were used to model incre mental cost and health outcomes (using quality adjusted lifeyears, QALYs) attributable to ES. Three models were developed: (1) outcomes in patients only, (2) outcomes inpatients and ï¬rst degree relatives as a result of cascade testing, (3) outcomes in patients and ï¬rst degree relatives including parental reproductive outcomes. Results: When the directly observed cost and health outcomes of the cohort participants were forecast over 20 years, the use of ES resulted in a total gain of 7.63 QALYsfor the cohort and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD$24,887.80 per additional QALY gained. When cascade testing in ï¬rst degree relatives was added to the model, cost effectiveness was substantially increased, generating a total gain of 16.15 QALYs and an ICER of AUD$12,331.17. When parental reproductive outcomeswere added to the model, this produced the most cost effective outcome, with a total QALY gain of 40.55 and an ICER of AUD$11,899.69. Discussion and Conclusions: ES in suspected mono genic disorders becomes more cost effective as the bene ï¬ts of cascade testing and reproductive outcomes are realised. L. Rynehart: None. D.

31266,"1University of Bristol School of Psychological Science, Bristol, United Kingdom,2University of Bristol Medical School, Bristol, United Kingdom Introduction: The accuracy and accessibility of direct to consumer genetic tests (DTCGT) has increased rapidly inthe last few years. Consequently, it is important to research who is using these tests and why. This study explored the underlying psychosocial factors that impact on interest inDTCGT, including the in ï¬uences of personality and price (Â£149 versus free of charge) on the decision making process. Methods: Participants ( N,168, average age ,18 25 years), recruited via social media and email, completed an online survey including the 44 item Big Five PersonalityInventory. This measured: Neuroticism; Extraversion; Conscientiousness; Openness; Agreeableness. Additional questions measured levels of interest in DTCGT and howthese vary as a function of price. Results: Increased conscientiousness was associated with decreased interest in free of charge DTCGT, perhaps aresult of the perception that genetic tests pose a greater threat to mental health than a bene ï¬t to physical health. In participants over 25 years, interest in Â£149 DTCGT wasassociated with increased openness. Extraversion was associated with decreased interest in free DTCGT in 18 251812year olds. Neuroticism and agreeableness did not predict interest. 86% of participants asserted a GP recommendation would heighten their interest. Conclusion: Personality and price both affected interest in DTCGT. Interest peaked when tests were free of charge and with a GP recommendation. This suggests the UK âs use of genomic medicine will attract signi ï¬cant interest, butpatients with different personality traits may require per sonalised support during the consent process. We are cur rently exploring the UK public âs awareness and acceptance of genomic medicine to further inform NHS consent procedures. H. Davies: None. R. Wootton: None. O. Davis: None. C.

The key regulators of developmental defects can be studied during this critical window, but conventional approaches lack the throughputand resolution to obtain a global view of the molecular states and trajectories of a rapidly diversifying and expanding number of cell types. We have developed a three step combinatorial barcoding method to pro ï¬le single cell transcriptomes ( âsci RNA seq3 â²) without requiring physical isolation of each cell. We have used this new method to pro ï¬le whole mouse embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation with sci RNA seq3, and created a transcriptional atlas of mouseorganogenesis at single cell resolution ( http://atlas.gs.wa shington.edu/mouse rna/ ). We identify hundreds of expanding, contracting and transient cell types and de ï¬ne the corresponding sets of cell type speci ï¬c marker genes, several of which we validate by whole mount in situ hybridization. With Monocle 3, we delineate and annotate56 single cell developmental trajectories of mouse organo genesis. We explore the dynamics of proliferation and gene expression within cell types over time, including focusedanalyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle. These data comprise a foundational resource for mammalian developmental biology.

However, it remains unclear how structure relatesto function and here we aim at studying this by assembling a dataset combining the activity of regulatory elements (ChIP seq for H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac),expression of genes (RNA seq) and genetic variations of 317 European individuals across two cell types (Lympho blastoid Cell Lines and Fibroblasts). First, we show that the regulatory activity is structured in 12,583 Cis Regulatory Domains (CRDs) that are re ï¬ective of Topologically Associating Domains. In addition, we alsoï¬nd 25,315 signi ï¬cant associations between CRDs located on distinct chromosomes that form 30 Trans Regulatory Hubs (TRHs) and re ï¬ect the global chromatin organization into A/B nuclear compartments. Second, we show that CRDs and TRHs delimit the sets of active regulatory elements controlling the expression ofmost genes and are key contributors of cis and trans gene co expression. Finally, we show that CRDs are under strong genetic control. We discovered 58,968 chromatin peaks affected by nearby genetic variants (cQTLs). At the CRD level, this converts into genetic control of the activity of 6,157 CRDsand the structure of 110 CRDs. In practice, we estimated that 75% of these are eQTLs and showed that CRDs and TRHs capture complex regulatory networks into which theeffects of eQTLs are propagated and combined to affect gene expression.

Miscarriage is associated with excessive bleeding, infection, depression, infertility and an increased lifetime risk ofcardiovascular disease. A variety of predisposing factors have been associated with increased miscarriage risk, and it has a genetic component that thus far has remained poorlycharacterized. Our aim was to discover and map the maternal genetic susceptibility and underlying biology of sporadic and recurrent miscarriage. Materials and Methods: We performed a genome wide association study including up to 69,118 sporadic mis carriage cases from seven different ancestries, 750 recurrentmiscarriage cases of European ancestry, and up to 359,469 female controls. We investigated the genetic architecture of miscarriage with biobank scale Mendelian randomization,heritability, genetic correlation and functional annotation analyses. Results: We identi ï¬ed one and four loci signi ï¬cantly (p <5Ã1 0 â8) associated with sporadic and recurrent mis carriage, respectively. Following functional annotation linked these associations with genes related to gonadotropinregulation, placental biology and progesterone production. We found a heritability of 29% (95%CI 20 â38%) for mis carriage. Consistent with observational associations, wefound signi ï¬cant genetic correlations between sporadic miscarriage and number of children (p ,7.2 Ã 10 â9). Conclusion: Our results con ï¬rm miscarriage as a com plex partly heritable phenotype and implicate novel biology through regulation of genes involved in gonadotropin reg ulation, placental biology and progesterone production.

Following clear consent practices, and only using aggregate, deidenti ï¬ed data, we pooled parent child trio exome data from GeneDx, the Deciphering Developmental disorders study and Radboud University Medical Center to form a dataset of 31,058 DDtrios. We identi ï¬ed 45,242 de novo mutations (DNMs), which were called with similar sensitivity and speci ï¬city across the three cohorts. We devised a novel simulation based method to test for an enrichment of damaging DNMs in individual genes. This method scores all classes of variants on a uni ï¬ed severity scale based on the empirically estimated positive predictive value of being pathogenic, and incorporates a gene based weighting derived from the deï¬cit of protein truncating variants (PTVs) in the general population. Applying this method, we identi ï¬ed 307 sig niï¬cantly enriched genes exome wide of which 49 arenovel. The novel genes have a signi ï¬cantly larger ratio of missense to PTV DNMs compared to the known genes, suggesting they are less likely to act via haploinsuf ï¬ciency. We also investigated phenotypic similarity in patients harbouring mutations in the novel genes and compared the phenotypic distribution between the known and novelgenes. Overall, we explained ~51% of the exome wide DNM burden within our dataset. We compared the likelihood of our observed DNMs under different under lying genetic models to estimate how many genes underpin the remaining 49% and the sample size needed to identify these. J.

CRISPR/Cas9 induced deletions of the homologous region in mice resulted in a double dorsal limb phenotype recapitulating the human malformation due to a complete loss of En1 expression speciï¬cally in the limb. Using genome wide epigenetic studies in the developing mouse and human limbs, we characterized a new lncRNA ( Maenli â Master regulator of engrailed in the limb) in the deleted region consisting of an approximately 1kb 4 exon transcript. Detailed characteriza tion in vivo including promoter deletion, promoter inver sion, and insertion of a stop cassette showed that Maenli speciï¬cally regulates En1 expression in the limb but not at other sites such as the brain. We also show that theinactivation of Maenli is the cause of the double dorsal limb phenotype and as such the ï¬rst description of an lncRNA in a human developmental disorder. Our study highlights theinvolvement of lncRNAs as a new disease mechanism in congenital malformations. L. Allou: None. S. Balzano: None. A. Magg: None. M. Quinodoz: None. B. Royer Bertrand: None. R.

While these genomes were an important starting point for research, they were not enough to change health care. Hundreds of thousands of people need to have their own genome sequenced and done so at a complete and accurate level to have suf ï¬cient data to interpret the genome. Cost was prohibitive and thetechnology was not yet robust enough in 2007 to make this a reality. Three years ago, this changed with the advent of new sequencing technology and improved bioinformaticsand machine learning tools. Dr. Venter and his team continue their work today which was begun decades ago in comparing genotype to phenotype to better understandhuman biology, health and disease. He will discuss ongoing research which the primary objective is to realize the full impact of genomics prediction, to have a thorough under standing of the DNA software and how it codes for the wide range of human phenotypes and abilities. He and his team have a 25 year track record of continually increasing theinformation content that can be derived from the human genome. More recently, we have merged this expertise with an extensive phenotyping platform and machine learningtechniques to demonstrate its predictive power to improve health outcomes. Dr. Venter will also discuss his pioneering work in synthetic biology. In 2010, he and his team at theVenter Institute became the ï¬rst to successfully construct âsynthetic life ââputting humankind at the threshold of the most important and exciting phase of biological research,one that is enabling us to actually write the genetic code for designing new species that can be used in many ways for the betterment of mankind. The science of syntheticgenomics is and will continue to have a profound impact on human existence, including new chemical and energy generation, human health and medical advances, cleanwater and food production, positive environmental impact, and possibly even our evolution.

31275,"Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands The manifestation of common complex diseases is the outcome of interaction of many different genetic factors in conjunction with non genetic environmental factors. Inrecent years, the knowledge on our genome has been greatly expanded, as thousands of genetic variants have been associated to hundreds of complex traits and diseases. In addition, we have seen increasing awareness of the important role of another set of genomes in our body, also known as human microbiome or our second genome. Ourgut microbiome encodes some 150 times more genes that the host genome. While the human genome is set at birth, the gut microbiome can undergo dynamic changes over thecourse of an individual âs life. By making use of the population based LifeLines DEEP cohort, we have shown that the inter individual variation of the gut microbiomecaptures quite some of the variation contributed by genetic and non genetic environmental factors, thereby contributing to the susceptibility to complex diseases. Since the gutmicrobiome can be modi ï¬ed, this offers opportunities for future therapeutic interventions. However we ï¬rst need to understand if changes in the microbiome cause disease, orwhether the microbial changes are the consequence of disease. To move towards causality we applied, as a proof of concept, Mendelian Randomization and were able toshow that microbial changes are causal for type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits. Furthermore, we are developing a gut on a chip, a sophisticated micro ï¬uidic device to study the interplay between the human host, the gut epithelial barrier, the immune system and the gut microbiome.

This progress is accompanied by a need for urgentattention to the question of how to apply this knowledge clinically in such a way as to promote the best possible outcomes for those who live with psychiatric disorders andtheir families. Methods: In this presentation, the outcomes of applying our developing knowledge of the etiology of psychiatric disorders in the clinical setting will be reviewed. For example, we will explore the psychological importance for people with psychiatric illness and their families of under standing cause of illness, and in particular, the psycholo gical and behavioural rami ï¬cations of understanding that there is a genetic contribution to these conditions. Theimpact of counseling environment, timing of family history documentation, and risk communication on patient out comes of psychiatric genetic counseling will be discussed.

In particular, the immune checkpoint blockers that unleash host anti tumour lymphocytes, or the adoptivetransfer of anti tumour T cells have provided remarkable results. Regrettably, although these treatments yield extra ordinary hope, only a small fraction of patients fullyrespond. Resistance to treatment can be intrinsic to tumour cells, but it is also conferred by the tumour microenviron ment. We will discuss the principles of immunotherapyexempli ï¬ed with current options and results in various types of cancers and envisage the future avenues. Then, I will present two ongoing research lines in our laboratory. First, I will present a cellular immunotherapy product composed of gamma delta T cells that selectively target malignant (but not normal) leukocytes. This subsetexpresses the Vdelta1 TCR and a broad repertoire of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), such as NKp30 and NKp44, which recognize transformation induced ligands like B7 H6. We will discuss the research behind these lymphocytes, termed Delta One T (DOT ) cells, that leads to their pro posed testing in leukaemia clinical trials by the end ofthe year. Second, I will provide evidence that we can induce tumour regression in mouse model of breast cancer, in amanner that depends strictly on macrophages. Macro phages, which can represent over 50% of the tumour immune in ï¬ltrate, are usually associated with poor prog nosis. Although these myeloid cells can also act as powerful anti tumour effectors, the effective induction of anti tumour functions in macrophages remains a major scienti ï¬c and clinical challenge.

Among the latter repetitive class, micro satellites or short tandem repeats (STRs, â¤10 bp) are particularly dynamic sequences and are prone to expansion mutations that cause >30 neurological and neuromuscular diseases. While STR expansions may occur in both thecoding and noncoding regions of genes, pathomechanistic studies of noncoding expansions led to the discovery of STR induced RNA mediated and protein mediated toxicitymechansims, due to either RNA binding protein (RBP) sequestration or repeat associated non AUG (RAN) transla tion (RAN), respectively. To gain further insights into disease pathology and also provide mammalian platforms for drug testing, transgenic mouse models for these diseases have often employed heterologous promoters and gene contexts but this strategy fails to reproduce the tissue speciï¬city, developmental timing and spatial expression of the affected endogenous gene. Here, we report thedevelopment of a new generation of mouse knockin models using rolling circle ampli ï¬cation (RCA) in vitro to generate large stable repeat expansions combined with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy type 1, which is caused by a CTG expansion (CTG exp) in the 3 â²UTR of the DMPK gene.

AONs are employed for a variety of inherited diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and various metabolic disorders. In thispresentation, I will mainly focus on the use of AONs for inherited retinal diseases (IRD), a group of disorders that is highly heterogeneous, both at the genetic and clinical level. Our proof of concept work on the correction of a recurrent splicing defect underlying CEP290 associated Leber con genital amaurosis (LCA), one of the most severe subtypesof IRD, has led to the initiation of a clinical trial, with recently announced promising results, demonstrating safety and in some subjects ef ï¬cacy upon intra ocular AON delivery. We expanded the use of AONs for the treatment of other subtypes of IRD, including Stargardt disease (STGD1) which is caused by ABCA4 mutations. Employing midigene splice assays, as well as using patient derived ï¬broblast cells, we have identi ï¬ed the splice defects that are associated with a large group of recently identi ï¬ed deep intronic ABCA4 mutations. In some cases, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology differentiation of iPSC cells towards a retinal fate was needed todemonstrate retina speci ï¬c splicing defects. In all cases, AONs were designed that were able to rescue the aberrant splicing events. Another, recurrent, ABCA4 variant (c.768G>T) leads to an exon extension of 35 nucleotides (nt), thereby disrupting the reading frame. Intriguingly, also the 35 nt extension caused by the common c.768G>Tvariant could be rescued by blocking the alternative splice donor site in intron 6, forcing the spliceosome to use the original splice donor site of exon 6. Taken together, AONsappear to be an effective and versatile tool to correct different types of splice defects associated with STGD1. Given the promising data obtained so far in a clinical trialusing AONs for the treatment of CEP290 associated LCA, AONs may serve as a more broadly applicable therapeutic strategy for various subtypes of IRD.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal reces sive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) are cilia related disorders and the two main forms of monogenic cystic kidney diseases. ADPKD is a common disease that mostlypresents in adults, whereas ARPKD is a rarer and often more severe form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) that prenatally may result in Potter âs oligohydramnios sequence. Early and severe forms of PKD are quite common. About the same number of children do carry mutations in the major genes for ARPKD and ADPKD. The latter often arisede novo or may affect both disease alleles in a recessive mode. In addition, mutations in several other cystogenes can phenocopy early and severe PKD. A comprehensiveknowledge of disease causing genes is essential for the correct diagnosis, recurrence risk and parental counselling. Cell biological and clinical research approaches haveexpanded our knowledge of its pathogenesis and revealed some mechanistic overlap between the different forms of PKD. A reduced âdosage âof PKD proteins is thought to disturb cell homeostasis and converging signalling path ways, such as Ca2 +, cAMP, mTOR, WNT, VEGF and Hippo signalling, and could explain the more severe clinicalcourse in some patients with PKD. Genetic diagnosis might beneï¬t families and improve the clinical management of patients, which might be enhanced even further withemerging therapeutic options.

Indeed, most of the 50 genes identi ï¬ed to date in SRNS encode proteins that are expressed in the podocyteand that are structural podocyte proteins or are involved in key biological pathways such as regulation of actin or microtubule dynamics and organization, vesicular traf ï¬ck ing and cellular recycling processes... More recently, important progresses have been made in deciphering the genetic bases of Galloway Mowat syndrome (GAMOS)associating SRNS with neurological defects and micro cephaly. This syndrome raises the fascinating question of the molecular pathways that could be common to brain andkidney, in line with the growing evidence that podocytes and neurons share a large set of molecular processes essential to development of the glomerulus and the nervoussystem.

31282,"Kidneys cannot naturally regenerate lost tissue, and few preventive medications exist, limiting treatment options to temporary salves of dialysis or transplant with substantial side effects. We have developed a simple method todifferentiate human pluripotent stem cells into intricately patterned, multi segment organoids that resemble kidney tissues. These organoids form via a developmental pathwaythat induces the nephron progenitor cell, which gives rise to podocytes, proximal tubules, and distal tubules along a proximal to distal axis. While beautiful, how to translate organoids into innova tive therapies for organs as complex as human kidneysremains a critical question. To address this challenge, we have applied CRISPR gene editing to reveal disease mechanisms in organoids and test therapeutic interventions. Mutations associated with polycystic kidney disease or cilia cause organoid tubules to swell thousands of times in size, producing large, ï¬uid ï¬lled cysts of centimeter diameters. In contrast, mutations associated with podocytes, the ï¬l tering cells of the kidney, do not affect tubules but cause junctional deformities that explain urinary defects in vivo. Harnessing the power of automation, scRNA seq analysis of organoids reveals sixteen different cell types, and iden tiï¬es a novel three gene signature of glomerular disease that appears in human patients. To improve organoid function and seek therapies, thou sands of organoids can be manufactured simultaneously inhigh throughput screening formats, and analyzed for multi dimensional phenotypes of differentiation, toxicity, and disease. Screening reveals treatments that dramaticallyincrease the vascular endothelium, and a surprising role for non muscle myosin in cystogenesis, which can be targeted pharmacologically targeted to modulate cystogenesis. Organoids with live ï¬uorescence reporters and in micro ï¬uidic kidney on a chip formats provide next generation platforms for phenotypic screening and illumination ofintracellular mechanisms at the tissue scale.

These maps are being re ï¬ned by1052ongoing single cell sequencing projects (HCA, HuBMAP, etc.), which will eventually give rise to a comprehensive catalog of all cells in the human body. However, we are lagging behind with our ability to assign biological functions to the observed gene regulatory patterns. CRISPR based genetic screens have the potential to accelerate functional and gene regulatory studies, but cur rent methods have inherent limitations. Widely used pooled screens are restricted to simple readouts including cellproliferation and sortable marker proteins. Arrayed screens allow for comprehensive molecular readouts such as tran scriptome pro ï¬ling, but operate at much lower throughput. To overcome these limitations, we combined pooled CRISPR screening with single cell RNA sequencing into a broadly applicable work ï¬ow, directly linking guide RNA expression to transcriptome responses in thousands of individual cells (Datlinger et al. 2017 Nature Methods). Our CROP seq method enables pooled CRISPR screens withsingle cell transcriptome resolution in a way that scales well in the number of cells (up to millions using combinatorial indexing) and target genes (up to genome wide). We and many other labs have found CROP seq broadly useful for studying biological mechanisms that are dif ï¬cult to reduce to a simple readout needed for classical pooledscreens. Applied to heterogeneous cell populations and ex vivo tissue (e.g., in combination with Cas9 expressing mice), CROP seq can identify cell type speci ï¬c regulation in entire organs and uncover cellular differentiation hierarchies. Given the increasing throughput of single cell tran scriptomics and the advent of single cell multi omics tech nology (reviewed in: Bock et al. 2016 Trends in Biotechnology), CROP seq enables deep pro ï¬ling of large CRISPR libraries and constitutes a powerful method for functional biology at scale.

Our studies indicate that family history is an important trigger for many people to engage with testing but discordance between an individual âs genomic pro ï¬le results and their family history can cause confusion and adversely impact upon their risk reducing lifestyle behaviours, such as weight loss and smoking cessation. Often those individuals taking up direct to consumer testing have already optimised lifestyle risk reducing health behaviours. Of concern is that positive genomic results may precipitate a fatalistic attitude andnegative health beliefs about improving health. Similarly, negative results may trigger apathy towards risk reducing behaviours, even though these individuals may still be athigh risk of disease as a result of avoidable risk factors.

In newborn bloodspot screening (NBS), expansion is facilitated by increasedclinical understanding of disorders and the availability of new treatments, which can improve early diagnosis to prevent irreversible health damage in children. While the expansion of screening tests could be seen as beneï¬cial, it also raises new ethical, psychological and societal issues. Many of the screening developments aretechnology driven, and it is important to attune to parents â demand. With the increasing number and type of conditions for which testing can be offered, the number of false posi tive and additional (unclear) ï¬ndings increases, thereby complicating information provision and counseling for informed decision making. Abnormal (positive) geneticscreening test results understandably have great impact on parents, but especially uncertain ï¬ndings can result in high parental anxiety.

31288,"There are over 1 million cases of prostate cancer (PrCa) worldwide per year and it is becoming the commonest solidcancer in men in the Western world. There is evidence for genetic predisposition to PrCa from case control1054epidemiological studies, and twin studies. The higher risks found with monozygotic versus dizygotic twins support the hypothesis that familial aggregation results from shared genetic rather than just environmental factors. Men of African ancestry have nearly twice the incidence rates of Caucasians. Genetic predisposition to common cancers is mainly due to a mixture of contribution from both common variants with slightly increased risks (generally a relative risk of 2 fold or less) and rarer, higher risk variants which confer higher risks (usually 3 â8 fold). In PrCa predisposition, we now have molecular evidence that both models exist; fur thermore, it is the common cancer with the highest pro portion of a common genetic variation component. Most of the rarer variants predisposing to PrCa are in the DNA repair pathway. Consistent evidence is now emerging that BRCA mutation carriers who develop PrCa also develop worse disease with a higher proportion of nodal andmetastatic spread, and have a poorer survival. More recently, evidence has also emerged that other genes in this pathway also predispose to PrCa and that the resultant PrCa disease is more aggressive. However, the largest component of genetic predisposition to PrCa is due to commoner genetic variants (occurring in>5% of individuals). Each confers a small relative risk, but because they are numerous and their risks are multiplicative, they can combine to contribute quite substantial relativerisks. In a study of 140 000 individuals using a chip, the OncoArray, with over 500 000 SNPs, in Caucasians, we discovered 65 new SNPs and when combined with previousï¬ndings, a total of 170 SNPs explain 38.5% of the familial relative risk of PrCa. In risk strati ï¬cation, men in the top 1% of the genetic risk score group have a relative risk of 5.7fold for developing PrCa compared with the median risk group. These results currently apply to Caucasian popula tions and a multiethnic analysis is on going.

These antithetical properties are the result of complexrelationships pitting the intrinsic activities of these retro elements against the host factors that evolve to mitigate their effects. Insertions provide a unique substrate forevolutionary innovation since either of the opposing functions can be made permanent. Our lab studies how the contours of this con ï¬ict impact human disease. First, I will describe how speci ï¬c transposable element loci âescape âsilencing in diseased tissues. For example, long interspersed element 1 (LINE 1) sequences are commonlyderepressed in human cancers, resulting in somatic retro transposition events and potentially creating unique mole cular requirements for cancer cell growth. Second, I willdescribe how rare and commonly occurring inherited insertion alleles can affect mRNA expression and splicing and lead to genetic disease. Examples include highlypenetrant disease alleles, as well as variants with lesser effects that are detectable by genome wide association study (GWAS). We have cataloged 809 polymorphic Alu elements mapping to 1,159 loci implicated in disease risk by genome wide association study (GWAS) (P < 10 â8). We found that Aluinsertion variants occur disproportio nately at GWAS loci (P ,0.013). Moreover, we have identi ï¬ed many of these Aluelements in linkage disequili brium (LD) with the trait associated SNP. We are nowworking to understand their molecular mechanisms. One variant of interest is an Aluinsertion at the CD58 locus on a haplotype that affects multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility(OR,1.3 p,3x10 â10). We found perfect LD between the trait associated SNP (rs2300747) and the intronic Alu insertion. We went on to show that the Alualters splicing of the CD58 mRNA, promoting exon 3 skipping in splice reporter assays, and creating a splice quantitative trait locus (sQTL) in lymphoblastoid cell lines. The aberrant CD58 isoform is frame shifted, and presumed to be non functional. This work provides a broader perspective on how structural variants of repetitive DNAs may contributeto human disease.

31291,"States Chromatin associated RNA (caRNA) could be regarded as a layer of the epigenome (Trends in Genetics, 2018, 34:867 â882). To elucidate the RNA layer of epigenome, we developed the iMARGI technology to discover caRNAsand reveal the respective genome interaction loci of each caRNA (Current Biology, 2017, 27(4): 602 â609; PNAS 2019, 116 (8) 3328 â3337). Applying iMARGI to analyze diverse human cell types, we observed that most of the transcription start sites in the human genome are occupied with long range interacting caRNAs (Current Biology,2017, 27(4): 602 â609). iMARGI also revealed the nearest chromosomal regions to nuclear speckles (iScience, 2018, 4:204 â215) and inter chromosomal proximity. Furthermore, iMARGI revealed that RNA DNA interactions in normal cells coincide with fusion RNA pairs in cancers (PNAS 2019, 116 (8) 3328 â3337). These data suggest an RNA poise model, where the spatial proximity of one gene âs transcripts and the other gene âs genomic sequence poises for the creation of fusion transcripts. S. Zhong: E.

31293,"Germany The three dimensional organisation of the genome plays a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression. Recent examinations of chromatin conformation have revealed the presence of hundreds of self associatingdomains and thousands of regulatory loops between enhancers and target genes that ensure a correct deployment of developmental programmes. Mutations affecting thesehighly conserved and relatively tissue unspeci ï¬c regulatory features often result in striking developmental defects and disease. Despite the characterisation of such regulatoryfeatures, it is currently unknown when chromatin con formation is established, the cellular mechanisms that drive this process and how they are affected in disease.

First, I will introduce animproved Hi C method for very low amounts of input material, down to one thousand cells. By systematically comparing Hi C libraries made with decreasing amounts ofstarting material I will show that the method is highly reproducible and robust to experimental noise.

31294,"Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have narrowed down the genome into regions underlying complex phenotypes. However, any one region still harbours thousands of correlated genetic variants, complicatingbiological follow up. We therefore need variable selection to reï¬ne the large set of variants simply associated with a phenotype down to a much smaller set of putative causalvariants with direct effect on the phenotype. We present the FINEMAP software that couples Bayesian variable selection for ï¬ne mapping causal variants with an ultrafast high resolution stochastic search. We show that FINEMAP is as accurate as gold standard exhaustive search implemented in existing ï¬ne mapping approaches when the latter can be completed and achieves even higher accuracy when the latter must be constrained due to computational reasons. We further demonstrate that FINEMAP opens up completely new opportunities by ï¬ne mapping genomic regions with tens of thousands of variants in few minutes while exhaustive search would require thousands of years. Statistical ï¬ne mapping methods that use GWAS results also require Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) information. We report important practical consequences of misspeci ï¬cation of LD that could happen when publicly available reference genomes are used. We demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that the size of the reference panel needs toscale with the GWAS sample size to produce accurate results. This ï¬nding has major implications for the appli cation of all ï¬ne mapping methods using GWAS results from GWAS consortia in which accurate LD information from each participating study is typically not available. GWAS sample sizes soon counted in millions provide unprecedented opportunities to use ï¬ne mapping results for downstream analysis. Therefore, we investigate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by a ï¬ne mapping model compared to the variance component model BOLT. Although results from FINEMAP and BOLT showAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1057good concordance in regions with negligible contribution to the genome wide heritability, BOLT yields larger estimates than FINEMAP in regions with moderate to high herit ability levels. Scaling the analysis to biobank data, we further illustrate how violations of model assumptions on polygenicity induces inaccuracy to heritability estimatesthat become more accentuated as statistical power to iden tify causal variants increases.

31295,"human traits are increasingly undertaken in diverse popula tions. One approach that shows great promise for thelocalisation of causal variants underlying association signals is the aggregation of GWAS across diverse populations through trans ethnic meta analysis. Trans ethnic ï¬ne map ping is enabled by the observation that many lead SNPs for complex traits are shared across diverse populations, which is consistent with a model for which the underlying causalvariants are the same across ancestry groups and were derived from mutations that occurred before human population migration out of Africa. Under this model,trans ethnic ï¬ne mapping then takes advantage of the observation that patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) amongst common variants vary between populations. As aresult, across ancestry groups, we would expect to see strong association signals only at the causal variant and those SNPs in strong LD with the causal variant in allpopulations studied: the greater the diversity of GWAS, the more re ï¬ned the localisation will be. We will review methods for trans ethnic GWAS meta analysis, presentsimulations demonstrating the improved ï¬ne mapping resolution achieved with this approach, and highlight applications of these techniques to localising potentialcausal variants at complex human trait loci.

Recently, we performed agenome wide association study (GWAS) meta analysis of 694,649 individuals from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium and UKBiobank (UKBB) and identi ï¬ed 346 genome wide sig niï¬cant (p < 5 Ã 10 â9) loci associated to WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Additionally, we recapitulated theknown sexual dimorphism observed in WHRadjBM: ~30% of all loci are sex dimorphic, with most signals showing a larger effect in women. Notably, this sexual dimorphism isvirtually absent in GWAS of BMI, prompting a host of questions around the underlying biology of fat distribution and how elucidating (potentially sex speci ï¬c) mechanisms could yield insights into the etiology of fat distribution. We thus set out to perform comprehensive ï¬ne mapping and enrichment testing in the 346 loci associated withWHRadjBMI, as well as the 266 and 91 loci discovered in the women only and men only meta analyses, respectively. We used up to 484,563 samples from the UK Biobank to:(i) examine enrichment of WHRadjBMI associated loci in hundreds of cell and tissue types, (ii) perform Bayesian ï¬ne mapping to generate so called âcredible sets âof likely causal SNPs, (iii) test for global and local patterns of enrichment of the credible sets in various genomic anno tations, and (iv) perform functional work on likely causalvariants and genes. Global pathway analyses across the full GWAS results replicated the previously described enrichment ofWHRadjBMI signals in subcutaneous (p ,1.12 Ã 10 â8) and visceral (p ,1.23 Ã 10 â6) adipose tissue. We addi tionally observed novel enrichments in reproductive tissues,including cervix and uterus (pectocervix ,5.84 Ã 10 â5 and puterus ,8.65 Ã 10 7), a notable ï¬nding given the link between obesity, fat distribution, and fertility complications. We next used a Bayesian ï¬ne mapping approach (FINEMAP) to generate credible sets at each locus that capture 99% of the posterior probability that the causal SNP(s) are in that SNP set (i.e., the â99% credible set â). We found that for 215 of the 346 (~62%) in the combined sample, FINEMAP identi ï¬ed only 1 likely causal SNP. A similar proportion of the women only and men only loci were most likely to contain only 1 causal SNP. Finally, we tested to see if our credible sets were enriched in genomic annotations via ENCODE and the Roadmap Consortium. We found that SNPs in credible sets derived1058from the GWAS of WHRadjBMI in men were enriched in ChIP seq binding tracks for EZH2, a component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 implicated in the adipo genesis pathway. We are currently characterizing the functional effect of SNPs that overlap EZH2 binding motifs. Our work demonstrates how large scale GWAS data, in combination with ï¬ne mapping approaches and integration of omics data, can be leveraged to begin revealing pertur bations in biological pathways that drive alterations in fatdistribution.

Despite marked phenotypic differences, âepileptic encephalopathy âshares a similar genetic spectrum with âNDD with unspeci ï¬ed epilepsy â, which is not re ï¬ected by current clinical classi ï¬cations. In general, individuals with missense DNV were more likely to have epilepsy than individuals withtruncating DNV. 33 genes displayed a signi ï¬cant excess of DNV in epilepsy cases, of which SNAP25 and GABRB2 had previously only limited evidence of disease association. Joint analysis of the overall cohort also implicated CACNA1E as a novel NDD gene. Furthermore, comparing the designs of 24 diagnostic epilepsy panels of differentproviders revealed extensive inconsistencies. All panel designs lacked various genes with high diagnostic value and by contrast showed vast excess of genes with low or nodiagnostic value.

Genetic counseling for recurrence risk when a family has a child with a de novo pathogenicvariant, estimated at around 1 â3%, is largely based on empirical data and accounts for the possibility of germline mosaicism in one parent. In families where parentalgermline mosaicism is present, however, the true recurrence risk may be as high as 50%. Low level mosaicism is easily missed by Sanger sequencing technology, but massivelyparallel sequencing technology permits deep sequencing and allows the detection of mosaic alleles.

It has become practically impossible to keep track of their number; a review from last year listed 105 different types (PÃ©anneet al. Eur J Med Genet. 61(11):643 â663, 2018). PMM2 CDG remains by far the most frequent type 1 CDG (two thirds of the cases collected by the EUROGLYCANETconsortium). MAN1B1 CDG and several COG de ï¬ciencies are among the more frequent type 2 CDG. Almost all CDG are recessive disorders, either autosomal or X linked. However, the collection of CDG harbours a number of genetically interesting observations. Thus far, ALG1 deï¬ciencies were rarely identi ï¬ed because a large number of pseudogenes complicates diagnostics; this has now been solved by using an NGS approach. COG4 CDG was known as a typical CDG. Recently, it was shown that a recurrent de novo COG4 mutation causes Saul Wilson syndrome. Interestingly, a 5 â²upstream GGC expansion of the XYLT1 gene is present either in a homozygous or in a compoundheterozygous state in a large majority of patients with Baratela Scott syndrome.

For exam ple, in eukaryotic cells, the Ca2+concentration along the secretory pathway (ER/ Golgi) decreases progressively. Many pumps and transporters are involved in this tight regulation such as SERCA and SPCA1 pumps. Mutationsof the secretory pathway Ca 2+ ATPase isoform 1 (SPCA1) cause a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder called Hailey Hailey disease. Similarly, mutations of ER SERCACa 2+ ATPase cause also a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder called Darier Disease. Alterations of Golgi pH can also cause diseases such as autosomal Cutis laxa (type II) where N and O glycosylation are altered as well as the trafï¬cking of speci ï¬c proteins.

On the one hand, we study thedistribution of mutations across different regions in the genome to understand basic questions about molecular biology, such as the interplay between DNA damage andrepair, and other cellular processes. With these studies we have discovered different small scale genomic features i.e., spanning between a dozen and a few hundred base pairs that interfere with the deposition of different types of DNA damage and the mechanisms of DNA repair. For example,we recently showed that the periodicity in the orientation of the DNA minor groove with respect to nucleosomes determine a periodic pattern in the generation of somatic mutations across human tumors, germline variants across populations, and genetic divergence across closely related species. We demonstrated that the known widespread WWperiodicity across eukaryotic genomes â10 bp A/T dinu cleotides periodicity could have arisen as a result of the periodic de novo mutation rate. On the other hand, we study the genetic basis of tumors and their basic biology. Combining an ensemble of bioin formatics tools developed in our group and others with theaim of detecting signals of positive selection in the pattern of mutations of genes across tumors, we have produced a catalog of the genes that drive tumorigenesis in 60 cancertypes. We go one further step to identify which amongst all the mutations of these genes drive each individual tumor.

Liquid biopsy tumor genotyping using circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood has been recently applied to molecularly pro ï¬le cancer patients, to monitor tumor burden during therapy and to uncover novel mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies. We used metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) asa model to assess whether liquid biopsies could in principle uncover molecular mechanisms responsible for the emer gence of resistance and track clonal evolution duringtargeted therapies. Emerging evidence indicates that escape from EGFR and HER2 targeted therapy are molecularly heterogeneous and involve several genes. We exploitedplasma ctDNA analysis by Next Generation Sequencing and Digital PCR to de ï¬ne gene alterations responsible for primary or acquired resistance to anti EGFR and anti HER2therapies. While most mCRC patients who receive anti EGFR antibodies develop KRAS mutations during treat ment, we found that additional mutations affecting keynodes of the EGFR signaling pathway can also confer resistance. Mutated KRAS clones, which emerge in blood during EGFR blockade, decline upon withdrawal of EGFR speciï¬c antibodies, indicating that clonal evolution con tinues beyond clinical progression. ctDNA pro ï¬les of individuals who bene ï¬t from multiple challenges with anti EGFR antibodies exhibit pulsatile levels of mutant KRAS . These results indicate that the CRC dynamicallyadapts to intermittent drug schedules and provide a molecular explanation for the ef ï¬cacy of rechallenge therapies based on EGFR blockade.

Identifying and characterizingthese mutations, however is challenging; unlike coding loci, the locations and function of DNA regulatory elements cannot typically be determined by DNA sequence alone. Regulatory elements are also highly context speci ï¬c, with many elements showing activity and accessibility to protein binding in a subset of tissues or developmental stages. Single cell chromatin pro ï¬ling provides on solution to these issues by allowing researchers to identify protein bound regulatory elements across multiple tissues and develop mental stages in a single experiment.

Using traditional and new population genomics analysis approaches, we estimate the deepest human population divergence time to between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. This estimateincreases the deepest divergence among modern humans, coinciding with anatomical developments of archaic humans into modern humans as represented in the localfossil record, and suggest that modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago.

I demonstrate theupper limit of time depths on historic intermixing that these techniques can detect reliably when using increas ingly larger cohorts of genetically similar individuals.

They encompass common muscular dystrophies suchas Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); motorneuron diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and less common limb girdle muscular dystrophies, peripheralneuropathies and congenital myopathies. Each of these conditions presents its own therapeutic challenges. In muscular dystrophies one major obstacle is the abundanceof the target organ (skeletal muscle is ~40% of the body weight), the need to target the heart and, as far as DMD is concerned, the size of its cDNA that, at 14 Kb, precludesthe use of commonly used viral vectors. For SMA, one of the challenges is the need to target all motorneurons, and the short window for therapeutic intervention in this rapidlyprogressive condition affecting infants. For congenital myopathies such as myotubular myopathy, the profound severity of affected children and their fragility complicatethe design and execution of clinical trials. The landscape for these conditions is however very changing rapidly, thank to early success in landmark studies, of which the mostadvanced are those in SMA and DMD. An AAV9 vector originally developed at Columbus University, has demon strated to be able to ef ï¬ciently correct motorneurons after intravenous administration, with acquisition of unprece dented functional achievements in SMA1 patients.

To address this, we applied a suite of approaches: long read, short read, strand speci ï¬c sequencing technologies, optical mapping, and variant discovery algorithms to comprehen sively analyze three human parent child trios to de ï¬ne the full spectrum of human genetic variation in a haplotype resolved manner.

Fifty eight of the inversions we discovered intersect with the critical regions of recurrent microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Takentogether, our SV callsets represent a sevenfold increase in SV detection compared to most standard HTS studies, including those from the 1000 Genomes Project. We usethese SV callsets to assess the performance of HTS studies including the types of variation that are missed by many current studies, SV detected in functional noncoding DNA,and the combinations of algorithms that most effectively detect SV in HTS reads.

Since DNA methylation is a reversible process, there is potentially a huge bene ï¬t in modulating DNA methylation for the treatment of human diseases, notably cancer. To achieve such anti cancer therapy, it is essential to decipherthe underlying molecular mechanisms. An overview of the most recent mechanisms will be presented. 2.

Both balanced chromosomalrearrangements and copy number variants (CNVs) as detected by karyotyping or chromosomal microarray might beneï¬t from further investigation by whole genome sequencing (WGS) to accurately resolve the structural rearrangement.

In our study, we use multiple complementary WGS experiments to phase and solve the structures of chromosomal rearrange ments.

Recently we integrated GWAS results with single cell transcriptomic data from the brain and the entire nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlyingpsychiatric disorders as well as neurological conditions and other brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with excitatoryneurons from the cortex/hippocampus, medium spiny neurons from the striatum, diverse sets of midbrain neurons, and inhibitory neurons from the cortex/hippocampus. Cognitive traits were generally associated with similar cell types but their associations were driven by different genes.

As a male speci ï¬c genetic risk factor, LOY could help explain why men in the entire world live shorter lives than women. It is not established whether the associations between LOY in leukocytes and risks for disease in other organs represent causal relationships, and if so, what the underlyingmechanisms could be. For example, LOY is associated with factors such as age, smoking as well as genetic background, and part of the LOY associated increased risk for variousoutcomes might be explained by these confounders. How ever, we have also proposed a hypothesis involving dis turbed functions of blood leukocytes without a Ychromosome and reduced protection against disease in men with LOY. Hence, LOY in immune cells might be responsible for impairment of normal immune systemfunctions such as in ï¬ammation and immune surveillance, responsible for elimination of abnormal cells and structures throughout the soma. To investigate if LOY changes the normal properties of immune cells we have studied LOY at the levels of DNA , RNA and plasma proteome; in bulk, sorted and single cells in vivo and in vitro. For example, we have (i) mapped the level of LOY in six major immune cell types in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer âs disease and prostate cancer, (ii) studied changes in gene expression in cells with LOY and identi ï¬ed numerous genes showing LOY associated tran scriptional effect (LATE) and (iv) found that LOY leaves afootprint in the plasma proteome.

We can now measure the functional effect of thousands of single nucleotide variantsin protein coding genes and other sequence elements such as promoters, enhancers and splice signals in a single experiment. The ability to scale functional assays meansthat functional scores are more likely to be available as evidence to help guide interpretation of variants of uncertain signiï¬cance that result from clinical genetic testing. These massive functional datasets already exist for BRCA1, TP53, PTEN, SUMO, CALM1/2/3, PPARG, TPMT and TPK1 . Many more will be generated in the near future and it islikely that one may be generated for your gene of interest. In this educational session, I will ï¬rst outline the general experimental steps in a multiplexed functional assay. I willthen present data sets for BRCA1 generated by saturation genome editing (Findlay et al. Nature, 2018) and PTEN generated by an assay for protein abundance (Matreyeket al.

Myers1 1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom,2Univer sity of California, Berkeley, CA, United States,3The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, CanadaDuring meiotic recombination in most mammals, hundreds of programmed DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) occur across all chromosomes in each cell at sites bound by the protein PRDM9, and resolve into recombination events, which generate new genetic diversity. Conversely mutations in PRDM9 itself, and at binding sites of PRDM9, driveprofound differences in the recombination landscapes both among individuals, and between all species possessing this gene so far examined, so diversity impacts recombination. PRDM9 is also the only known mammalian speciation gene, causing meiotic failure and male limited sterility in certain mouse hybrids. Our work has revealed that this isdriven by PRDM9 mainly binding ânon shared âsites that differ between the two homologous genomic copies present in hybrids, due to evolutionary mutations. This leads tounrepaired DSBs, failure to pair chromosomes, and sterility, indicating strong impacts of local sequence divergence on recombinational repair, via still unknown mechanisms. Fertility is fully restored by engineering mice with different, shared, PRDM9 binding sites. We will discuss new work that characterizes the impact of local sequence divergenceon mammalian recombination, using thousands of directly detected crossover and non crossover recombination events from a mouse hybrid cross, resolved with unprecedentedpower and resolution. Recombination events, but not DSBs, are strongly depleted at the ânon shared âsites. Therefore, mutations within PRDM9 binding sites disrupt and/orinhibit the homologous repair of DSBs. Previous work has found that in humans, GC biased gene conversion occurs in non crossovers, driving genome evolution. Unexpectedly, we found that in both mice and humans, this bias occurs exclusively in non crossovers containing just a single mismatch with no GC bias whatsoever innon crossovers with multiple mismatches. These results demonstrate that alongside altering where recombination initiates, local genetic diversity also profoundly altersmeiotic repair pathway decisions via at least two distinct mechanisms, impacting genome evolution and Prdm9 related hybrid infertility.

Recombination is initiated by the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), and in most organisms it is clustered in narrow regions, called recombination hotspots. The repair of DSBs reshapes the nucleotide landscape atrecombination hotspots and a high number of polymorph isms accumulate at hotspots over time. In humans and mice, these polymorphisms lead to changes in af ï¬nity of PRDM9, a meiosis speci ï¬c, trans acting protein that recognizes DNA target motifs and activates recombination hotspots. We still do not fully understand the exact molecular mechanismdriving the sequence erosion at hotspots, but it has important consequences in the outcome of recombination. We have characterized the processes re shaping thenucleotide sequences at recombination hotspots by screen ing a large number of single recombination molecules. We particularly focused on de novo mutations and geneconversion events, as well as the effect of poly A repeats of different lengths. The repair of DSBs can lead to a biased nucleotide composition at recombination hotspots by geneconversion, which is the non reciprocal exchange of DNA stretches of one chromosome to the other and is often associated with a higher probability of transmitting oneallele over the other. At recombination hotspots, the transmission of GC over AT variants are favoured resulting over time to a higher GC content at hotspots. Similarly, weobserved that longer poly A repeats are transmitted more often than shorter repeats resulting in an insertion biased gene conversion, albeit this depends on the nature of therepeat heterology. We also found that hotspots are enriched with de novo mutations, especially at CpGs sites that are prone to a high spontaneous deamination rate in the contextof single stranded DNA formed during DSB repair. Meiotic recombination leads to the sequence erosion at hotspots that in turn affects the binding of the recombination machineryand eliminates hotspots over time. In other words, hotspots have a tendency to self destruct through the systematic over transmission of alleles and accumulation of mutations,which poses the question if trans acting factors evolve as a response to these effects.

Furthermore, children who survive cancer often suffer from the long term side effects oftherapy. A crucial step in developing more speci ï¬c and less damaging therapies is to map the complete (epi )genetic repertoire of pediatric malignancies, which is highlyrelevant for the design of future clinical trials and for improving translational impact. Through the advent of genome wide molecular pro ï¬ling, speciï¬cally next generation sequencing, it became evident how heterogeneous and distinct childhood cancers are in comparison to the often environmentally associated adultcancers. The recent large scale pan cancer analyses of pediatric malignancies have demonstrated differences in tumor mutational burden and mutational signatures, as wellas unique driving events. The role of pathogenic germline variants predisposing to cancer is particularly important in this patient population, likely being involved in at least 10%of cases of childhood tumors. Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most common type of solid tumor in children and the leadingcause of cancer related death in this age group. Many of the discoveries which de ï¬ne the landscape of genomic altera tion across childhood cancers were made in this highlyrelevant entity, since pediatric CNS tumors have been extensively sequenced in large consortia and independent groups alike. Major genetic discoveries range from highlyrecurrent histone H3 mutations, and hijacking of distal enhancer elements, to new oncogenic gene fusions (of the NTRK family of kinases, among others). Further, chromatinmodiï¬ers were found to be recurrently altered in childhood brain tumors. This presentation focuses on key ï¬ndings that have been transforming the landscape of pediatric cancer research in the past decade and how these results are opening new avenues towards therapeutic approaches.

RaymondUniversity of Cambridge, Cambridge, United KingdomWith growing evidence that rare single gene disorders present in the neonatal period, there is a need for rapid,systematic, and comprehensive genomic diagnoses in ICUs to assist acute and long term clinical decisions. We performed trio whole genome sequence analysis (WGS)on a prospective cohort of families recruited in NICU and PICU at a single site in the UK. We developed a research pipeline in collaboration with the National Health Service(NHS) to deliver validated pertinent pathogenic ï¬ndings within 2 â3 weeks of recruitment. The analysis includes single nucleotide variants (SNV), copy number variants(CNV), structural variants (SV), uniparental disomy, mitochondrial genome analysis and speci ï¬c analysis of trinucleotide repeat diseases including myotonic dystrophyand Spinomuscular atrophy (SMA). >330 families had whole genome analysis performed and 20 â25% received a molecular diagnosis for the underlying genetic condition inthe child. The phenotypic description of the child was a poor predictor of the gene identi ï¬ed in 90% of cases, arguing for gene agnostic testing in NICU/PICU. Thediagnosis affected clinical management in >65% of cases including modi ï¬cation of treatments and care pathways and/ or informing palliative care decisions. A 2 â3 week turn around was suf ï¬cient to impact most clinical decision making. The use of WGS in intensively ill children is acceptable and trio analysis facilitates diagnoses. A âgene agnostic âapproach was effective in identifying an under lying genetic condition, with phenotypes and symptomatol ogy being primarily used for data interpretation rather thangene selection.

These differences can be the result of modifying mutations in other genes, that can either increase theseverity of a disease phenotype, or that can have a protective effect and compensate for the deleterious effects of the disease mutation. Although identi ï¬cation of modi ï¬er loci can highlight potential avenues for therapeutic inter vention, it requires data from large cohorts of patients carrying the same disease allele. Given the challengesassociated with identifying modi ï¬er mutations in humans, genetic interactions have mainly been studied using model organisms. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has often been the model organism of choice for systematic studies of genetic interactions due to its highly annotated genome and tractable genetics. Mapping genetic interac tions in model organisms provides a powerful approach for dissecting gene function and pathway connectivity, and for deï¬ning conserved properties of genetic interactions that can elucidate genotype to phenotype relationships. In addi tion, with the development of CRISPR Cas9 technology, we can now screen for genetic interactions directly incultured human cells.

Our laboratory, in collaboration with severalAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1075fertility clinics located in Europe, Africa and Asia, has gathered a large cohort of infertile males and females presenting with different marked phenotypes, such as acrosome less sperm showing a round shape (globozoos permia), sperm with ï¬agellum defects (teratozoospermia with Multiple Morphological Anomalies of the Flagella,known as MMAF), absence of sperm in the ejaculate (azoospermia), or oocytes blocked during meiotic matura tion. Exomic sequencing of these patients enable us toidentify 13 genes related to male infertility and 1 gene to female infertility, so far.

The Israeli population genetic carrier screening program for reproduc tive purposes is voluntary, available to all the population and free of charge. The program is used by most of the population at reproductive age and the tests are done eitherbefore marriage, before conception or during pregnancy. The program includes screening for all the severe diseases that are known to be relatively frequent in the populationand in which a test allows the detection of more than 90% of the carriers. Carrier screening for cystic ï¬brosis, SMA and FraX is recommended to all the population while forother diseases the recommendation is limited to the communities at risk: among Jews according to thecommunity of origin and among Arabs and Druze according to the religion and locality of origin. The extraordinary scienti ï¬c changes that occurred in the last decade revolutionized the offers of private carrier screening programs and pilots for population programs are ongoing in several countries.

Methods : We developed a rapid genomic diagnosis program involving 10 Australian hospitals and two labora tories with the aim of providing test results in <5 days for acutely unwell paediatric patients with suspected mono genic disorders. Rapid exome sequencing (rES) was per formed as trios when possible, and analysis utilised multidisciplinary expertise. Experience was shared between clinical sites, laboratories, and professional groups to enablecollective learning. Results : The program considered 123 patients for rES over 10 months, and approved 114 (93%). Five familiesdeclined testing (4.4%), and nine (7.9%) were withdrawn due to change in clinical circumstances. Of 100 patients tested, 51 received a diagnosis. Eleven of the diagnoses(21%) were made using approaches augmenting standard ES analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing, ES based copy number analysis, matchmaking of emerging genes,reverse phenotyping and RNA analysis. Median time from hospital admission to consent was 6 days (range 0â64 days); median time from sample receipt to clinical ES report was 3 days (range 2 â7 days). The total cost of testing was AU$1,123,000/ â¬701,638 (AU$11,230/ â¬7,016 per case). Changes in management following a result occurredin 77% of diagnosed patients and 10% of undiagnosed patients. Conclusion : We demonstrate the feasibility of a national, highly integrated clinical laboratory approach to rapid genomic diagnosis, which delivers results within a time frame relevant to acute paediatrics, while optimising clinicalutility and resource allocation.

Recently, Shiraishi developed a novel algorithm, âSAVNet: Splicing Associated Variants NET â, allowing the integrated analysis of RNA seq and exome data from cancer tissues. Methods: We applied the SAVNet algorithm to decipher abnormal splicing events and examined the correlation between these events and rare germline variants (MAF <0.03) among 179 phenotypically normal subjects whoseRNA seq data (lymphoblastoid cell lines) and correspond ing exome data were publicly available. Only the 1913 causative genes of known autosomal recessive disorderswere evaluated under the premise that the subjects could be carriers. Results: Among 1913 genes, 1272 had expression levels that were suf ï¬cient to be analyzed by SAVNet. Forty aberrant splicing events associated rare germline variants were detected in 31 of the 179 subjects; creation of alter native 5 â²splice site (13/40 events), creation of alternative 3 â² SS (14) and exon skipping (13). The predicted effects on protein were as follows: mutation out of frame (30), and in frame (10). Intriguingly, seven variants annotated as âmis sense â(5) or âsilent â(2) per exome analyses had triggered abnormal splicing that disrupted the reading frame. Con ventional exome analysis the 1272 genes detected a total of 144 putatively pathogenic variants including nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site (gt/ag) mutations. Discussion: Coupling interpretation of personal genomes with their corresponding transcriptomes successfully uncovered pathogenic splicing variants. Using this method,the detection rate of provisionally truncating pathogenic variants increased by twenty percent (28 / 144) in com parison with conventional exome analysis. M. Yamada: None. Y.

However, the identi ï¬cation interpretation of SVs often remains difï¬cult, in particular in complex chromosomal rearrange ments and when SVs do not disrupt protein coding sequence. Here, we address these issues by using chromo some conformation capture (HiC) in patient cell lines in combination with whole genome sequencing. Rearrange ments of the patient âs genome with respect to a reference genome emerge as distinct patterns in the HiC contact map. Additionally, HiC informs about the wiring of so called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), which havebeen shown to largely de ï¬ne the genomic range in which genes interact with enhancer elements. HiC was generated from ï¬broblasts or lymphoblasts from 3 individuals with complex rearrangements at the SOX9 locus and another 5 with interchromosomal translocations. HiC was instructive in revealing the complexity of rearrangements that involvedpreviously unrecognized deletions and insertions. The formation of novel TADs promoting ectopic enhancer promoter interaction was observed. HiC identi ï¬ed complex nested chromosomal translocations and revealed new enhancer promoter interactions upon chromosome fusion. HiC performed in LCLs from one patient with chromo thripsis showed a complex pattern of interchromosomal translocations, which were further validated by orthogonal methods (e.g M FISH). In summary, HiC can help to detectand to resolve SVs. The interpretation of SVs is supported by showing the emergence of new or altered TADs making HiC to a powerful tool to investigate the pathomechanismunderlying developmental disorder. U. S.

Here, we use data from 388,714 UK Biobank participants to assess putatively clinically relevantrare variants in a population based setting. Materials and Methods: Although rare variants are harder to genotype accurately than common variants, wewere able to classify 1,244 of 4,585 putatively clinically relevant variants genotyped on the UK Biobank SNP array as high quality. We de ï¬nedâclinically relevant âas variants that were either classi ï¬ed as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar or are in genes known to cause two speci ï¬c monogenic diseases: maturity onset diabetes of the youngand severe developmental disorders. We also called and visually inspected 96 copy number variants overlapping regions known to cause developmental delay, as well aslarge chromosomal events across the genome. We tested the association of these variants with 401 clinically relevant traits in UK Biobank. Results: We identi ï¬ed 27 putatively clinically relevant rare sequence variants and 12 rare copy number variants associated with traits in UK Biobank, exhibitingreduced penetrance or variable expressivity compared with their associated monogenic disease.

We report development of an automated variant prioritisation frame work, whose performance equals state of the art clinicalgenomic diagnosis using human experts. Methods: Genome. One operates a clinically accredited (ISO15189) whole genome diagnostic service in Sydney,Australia. A reference set of ~500 clinical referrals under went bioinformatics using a precisionFDA Award winning pipeline (Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics). Tertiarybioinformatics used published tools (Seave), with every case analysed by Doctoral genetics professionals. Addi tionally, a team of genetics experts performed variantreview of selected non trivial cases. We evaluated two automated pipelines: Moon (diploid. com), Eclipse (derived from Seave), and a combination ofthe two. Reference set concordance was required for ACMG Class 4 and 5 variants, and desirable (but notAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1079required) for Class 3 variants. Discordant results were adjudicated by the variant review expert team. Results: Both automated pipelines performed nearly as well as human experts, identifying at least 88 â98% of Class 4/5 and 60 â75% of Class 3 variants. Applying both in combination equalled human experts, with 100% con cordance for all Class 4/5 reportable variants and 75 â81% concordance for Class 3 variants. The new approach resulted in order of magnitude reduction (median reducedfrom 225 to 6 variants) in interpretation time and need for manual curation and review. Conclusion: An automated variant prioritisation protocol has been developed, whose performance equals that of credentialed clinical genetic diagnostic expert professionals. The pipeline has been validated and is accredited for clinicaldiagnosis. L. Burnett: A. Employment (full or part time); Sig niï¬cant; Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Genome.

However, it remains dif ï¬cult to predict if and when aberrant gene activation takes place in the context of BCRs. We have addressed the effect of BCRs on geneexpression in vivo by generating a series of genomic inversions that place an active limb enhancer cluster from theEpha4 regulatory domain at different positions within a neighboring gene dense region. Expression studies in embryonic limb buds show that the inverted enhancer cluster was able to activate several genes downstream of itsnew position, resulting in gene misexpression and limb phenotypes. Capture Hi C from mutant limb buds showed that the activated genes were located within a region with anasymmetric three dimensional pattern, so called architec tural stripes. Deletion of the CTCF binding site at the anchor of the stripe resulted in its disappearance, dimin ished ectopic gene expression, and a rescue of the skeletal phenotype. Moreover, unlike in the developing limb, inversion derived stripes do not form in mouse embryonicstem cells (mESC) where the enhancers are inactive, indicating that its formation is likely to be dependent on enhancer activity. Based on Hi C from limb buds we showthat architectural stripes are a frequent feature of the chromatin structure in vivo and often associate with developmentally active enhancers. Thus, BCRs can induceectopic gene expression and the formation of asymmetric chromatin contact pattern that are dependent on CTCF anchors and enhancer activity. K. Kraft: None. A. Magg: None. V.

TADs bring distant cis regulatory elements into proximity, a process dependent on the cooperative action of cohesin and the DNA binding factor CTCF. Surprisingly, genome widedepletion of CTCF has little effect on transcription, yet structural variations affecting TADs have been shown to cause gene misexpression and congenital disease. Here, weinvestigate the importance of TADs for gene regulation in vivo in mice by systematically editing CTCF sites, TAD boundary position, and TAD substructure orientation at theSox9 /Kcnj locus. Weï¬nd that TADs are formed by a redundant system of CTCF sites and fusion of two neighboring TADS requiresthe removal of all major sites within the TAD and at the boundary. However, this TAD fusion only results in leakage of regulatory activity from the Sox9 to the Kcnj TAD, but no major changes in gene expression. In contrast, inversions and/or the re positioning of boundaries actively re organize the 3D chromatin structure and thereby re direct regulatoryactivity, resulting in drastic gene misexpression and disease phenotypes. Our results suggest that TAD structures provide robust ness and precision, but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. In structural variations, ef ï¬cient re wiring of enhancer promoter interaction and aberrant diseasecausing gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation, but requires the re direction of chromatin con tacts. Thereby, our results provide a basis to predict theregulatory effects of structural variations. A. Despang: None. R. SchÃ¶p ï¬in:None. M. Franke: None. S. Ali: None. I. Jerkovic: None. C.

Although catalogs of regulatory elements are steadily improving, we have a limited understanding of the functional effects ofmutations within them. Here, we performed saturation mutagenesis in conjunction with massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on 20 disease associated gene promoters(e.g. HBG1 ,LDLR ,TERT ) and enhancers (e.g. IRF6 , SORT1 ,TCF7L2 ), generating functional measurements for over 30,000 single nucleotide substitutions (SNVs) anddeletions. Across elements, we ï¬nd that a majority of mutations leads to a reduction in activity (transversions more so thantransitions, deletions more so than SNVs), suggesting that transcription factor (TF) binding is more easily lost than gained. Further, the density of putative TF binding sitesvaries widely between regulatory elements. In the Telo merase reverse transcriptase ( TERT ) promoter, we identify additional and potentially clinically relevant activatingmutations, as well as regions that could be targeted to reduce promoter activity. By combining MPRA with GABPA knockdown, 63 TERT promoter variants show a signiï¬cant change in promoter activity, highlighting GAB PAâs role in TERT activation and oncogenesis. Our data provides a rich compendium for studying these 20 disease associated elements and characterizes effect sizes of regulatory mutations at an unprecedented scale. Although myriad annotations and integrative scores areavailable, no score consistently performs well in predicting the measured regulatory effects.

Alteration of chromatin architecture and/ orcis acting elements can lead to cis ruption disorder. Numerous unelucidated nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness 1 ( DFNB1) cases carrying out only one hetero zygous pathogenic mutation on Gap Junction Beta 2 ( GJB2 ) gene, led to strongly suggest the presence of distant cis regulation. To analyze chromatin conformation of a large DFNB1 locus, we performed the 5C technology and showed several chromatin contacts with GJB2 promoter. Then, to identify potential regulatory elements of the GJB2 gene, we analysed these chromatin interacting regions with the GJB2 promoter by reporter test activity and identifying cis regulatory elements which have enhancer action and silencer effect on GJB2 expression. Moreover, to explore DFNB1 locus architecture we analysed CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) binding along DFNB1 locus by ChIP qPCR and de ï¬ned an active domain in which cis acting elements were closer brought to the GJB2 promoter through chromatin looping. This ï¬rst study of DFNB1 three dimensional chromatin organization allows identi ï¬cation ofGJB2 cis acting elements. Finally, better understand of the molecular mechanisms of DFNB1 deafness could be important to improve genetic diagnosis of hearing loss, to adapt patients care and to develop small therapeuticmolecules.

Moreover, the number of hexanucleotide repeats within the SVA varies between patients and was recently found to inversely correlate with age at disease onset. TAF1 expression is decreased in XDP patients, and it was recently shown that by excising the SVA from XDP model cells TAF1 expression levels restore to levels found in wild type cells. To investigate molecular mechanisms by which the SVA affects TAF1 expression, we used chromatin immunopre cipitation (ChIP) analyzing a set of epigenetic markers within the TAF1 gene region, followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from XDP patients and sex matched controls. Thereby, we identi ï¬ed decreased H3K4me1 signal within a set of de ï¬ned enhancer regions in XDP patients compared to controls, indicating reduced activity of these regulatory regions. Moreover,general acetylation levels of histone 3, a marker of active chromatin, was shown to be decreased within exonic TAF1 regions in patient derived cell lines. Additionalenhancer âpromoter reporter assays revealed SVA mediated alterations of TAF1 promoter activity, even modulated by the number of hexanucleotide repeats within the SVA. In summary, we used patient derived cellular models and in vitro reporter gene assays to show SVA mediated alterations of epigenetic markers within the coding as wellas regulatory regions of TAF1 . Our results provide new insights into disease relevant mechanisms of SVA mediated alterations in TAF1 expression.

Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy (FAME) is characterised by cortical myoclonic tremor usually beginning in the second decade of life with lateronset of myoclonic and generalised tonic clonic seizures. There have been at least four different FAME loci identi ï¬ed through linkage analysis of large autosomal dominantfamilies that are located on chr2, 3, 5 and 8. Expansion of an endogenous ATTTT pentamer coupled with insertion and expansion of a novel ATTTC pentamer within theSAMD12 gene are the cause of chr8 FAME (FAME1). Using both long (Oxford Nanopore and PacBio) and short (Illumina and Complete Genomics) read whole genomesequencing, repeat primed PCR and Southern blotting we show that chr2 FAME is caused by a similar dynamic mutation of the same pentanucleotide repeats that arise intheï¬rst intron of the STARD7 gene. The ATTTC repeat expansion segregates with FAME in over 250 individuals from all 22 families tested so far. RNA Seq from patientderived ï¬broblast cell lines showed no accumulation of the AUUUU or AUUUC repeat sequences, however a sig niï¬cant enrichment of differentially expressed genes implicated in lysosomal storage disorders and progressive myoclonic epilepsy suggested that molecular pathways involved in cellular waste collection were active. Our datademonstrate the role of ATTTC repeat expansion in FAME2 and strongly support, regardless of the genomic locus, ATTTC pentamer expansions as a general cause ofFAME, which affect thousands of individuals worldwide.

Most of the mutations in these genes are disruptive, leading to haploinsuf ï¬ciency. Thus, any mole cular manipulation eliciting an increase in CHD2/CHD8proteins, could prove bene ï¬cial for therapeutic develop ment. Here, we intended to provide a Proof of Principle of how SINEUP recently described class of non codingRNAs able to augment, in a speci ï¬c and controlled way, the expression of target proteins can rise the translation of CHD2/CHD8 proteins and possibly rescuehaploinsuf ï¬ciency associated phenotypes. Methods: We designed and cloned SINEUP targeting human CHD2/CHD8 isoforms and tested their ef ï¬cacy to increase CHD2/CHD8 protein translation in human iPS derived neuronal progenitors (iPS NPC) expressing normal and reduced levels of the target proteins and in patients â ï¬broblasts bearing CHD2/CHD8 heterozygous loss of function mutations. Results: While different CHD2 /CHD8 SINEUP mole cules were not able to signi ï¬cantly increase protein level in parental iPS NPC, expressing physiologic levels of CHD2/ CHD8, SINEUP revealed to be effective in upregulatingCHD2/CHD8 protein translation when reduced levels of the target proteins were expressed. The ef ï¬cacy of CHD2/ CHD8 SINEUP is currently tested on patient derived cell lines harbouring CHD2/CHD8 truncating mutations.

Studies, however, have yet to shed light on the signi ï¬cance and pathogenic roles of brain somatic mutations in Alzheimer âs disease (AD). Here, we performed deep whole exome sequencing (average read depth 584X) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation andmatched blood tissues from 52 AD patients and 11 non demented individuals. We found an average of 11.96 and 12.55 somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in braintissue from AD patients and controls, respectively, and 59.31 and 59.17 SNVs from blood. The number of somatic mutations in brain specimens increased signi ï¬cantly with aging, and the rate of mutation accumulation in the brain was 4.8 fold slower than that in blood. The pathogenicsomatic mutations identi ï¬ed in 26.9% (14 of 52) of AD individuals were enriched in PI3K AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway genes known to contribute to hyperpho sphorylation of Tau. Further, we discovered that a pathogenic brain somatic mutation in PIN1 was more abundant in AT8 positive neurons in the entorhinal cortexand leads to a loss of function mutation. In vitro mimicking of haploinsuf ï¬ciency of PIN1 aberrantly increased the phosphorylation and aggregated form of Tau. Altogether,this study provides new insights into the genetic architecture underlying the pathogenesis of AD, demonstrating that brain somatic mutations associated with aging contribute tothe initial appearance of Tau pathology in the hippocampal formation of the AD brain.

Sphingomyeli nases generate ceramide from sphingomyelin as a second messenger in intracellular signaling pathways involved incell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. While the role of acid sphingomyelinase is well established, the role of neutral sphingomyelinases in human neurodevelopment hasremained elusive. Methods: Twenty ï¬ve children from ten unrelated families presented with microcephaly with simpli ï¬ed gyral pattern, cerebellar hypoplasia, severe developmental ence phalopathy, congenital arthrogryposis, diabetes mellitus and early demise. All index cases have bi allelic loss offunction variants in the SMPD4 gene, coding for neutral sphingomyelinase 3.We performed additional studies to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to diseasepathogenesis. Results: Fibroblasts from affected individuals showed morphologic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternaeabnormalities, consistent with a previously suggested function of SMPD4 in the ER. Overexpression of human Myc tagged SMPD4 in HEK392T cells showed localization of the protein to both the nuclear envelope and the ER. Previous studies localized SMPD4 to the outer nuclear membrane. Mass spectrometry of SMPD4 associated pro teins detected peptides belonging to nuclear pore complex proteins. We also observed delayed cell cycle progression after downregulation of SMPD4 by siRNA. These data are similar to former studies in HeLa cells showing mitotic abnormalities after si SMPD4 treatment. Conclusion: Our study describes a novel microcephaly syndrome characterized by severe neurologic abnormalities. Our results suggest a major function of neutral sphingomyelinase 3 in regulation of mitosis through mod ulation of nuclear membrane lipids, pointing to a novel mechanism and pathway in the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

The mechanism by which this occurs is notunderstood, however previous evidence suggests a role for CHD2 mediated chromatin remodelling during NHEJ. Methods: hIPSCs with doxycycline inducible Cas9 expression were used to create a heterozygous CHD2 mutant with an 11bp frameshift mutation (CHD2 +/ ). To study DSB repair, ï¬ve genomic targets were chosen, and three gRNAs lipofected for each, in wild type (WT) and CHD2+/âcell cultures. In order to capture a wide range of indels, a 1kb region was ampli ï¬ed around each target using PCR with a second used to apply DNA barcodes to each sample. Ultra deep whole molecule sequencing was per formed using the oxford nanopore minion. A comparisonwas made between the indels seen in the CHD2 +/âand WT cell lines. Results: A total of 4x10 6reads were obtained. In all tar gets, CHD2 mutations resulted in statistically signi ï¬cant increase in the number of larger (40bp 500bp) deletions, related to simultaneous cutting with more than one gRNA. Depending on the target, the increase ranged between 2 fold (p,1.48x10 â22) and 27.1 fold (p ,x10â260). At 3 of 5 targets, there was also a discernible shift in the pattern ofsmaller indels (<50bp length) at each individual cut site.1086Conclusion: The increase in mutations caused by multi ple cuts suggests that heterozygous mutations alter the dynamics of DNA repair, causing cuts to persist longer. In the developing brain, this could increase the risk of trans locations occurring, leading to a potential increase in pathological mosaicism in the mature brain. I. Tully: None. M. Alsaqati: None.

How ever, only about 50% of the cases can be genetically explained. Methods: We identi ï¬ed de novo variants in the TAOK1 (thousand and one amino acid kinase 1) gene in NDD patients. To validate this potential novel disease gene we (1)used GeneMatcher to identify additional patients, (2) established a primary ï¬broblast line of one of the patients and collected RNA from patient âsï¬broblasts and blood (PAXTube), and (3) established an RNAi mediated knockdown Drosophila model. Results: We compared the frequency of de novo variants in patient parent trios with (n ,2,030) vs. without (n , 2,755) NDD. We identi ï¬ed de novo variants in TAOK1 in four NDD patients but not in non NDD patients. Twoadditional patients were found through GeneMatcher. All variants were absent from gnomAD. The patients shared a common phenotype of developmental delay. Additionally,four patients had muscular hypotonia and three autism. In theï¬broblast culture, we demonstrated highly reduced TAOK1 mRNA levels compatible with nonsense mediated mRNA decay. No detectable phosphorylated TAOK1 pro tein was found in these cells. Knockdown of TAO (CG14217) in Drosophila resulted in developmental delay and reduced survival compared to control ï¬ies. Immunos taining of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), theirendings (boutons), and the ventral nerve cord (VNC) revealed changed NMJ and VNC morphology and sig niï¬cantly decreased amount of boutons compared to control ï¬ies. Conclusion: We provide compelling evidence that de novo mutations in TAOK1 are causative for a novel form of NDD. M. Dulovic Mahlow: None. J. Trinh: None. K. Kumar Kandaswamy: None. G.

Two mouse lines expressing either CGG RNA only (RNA only) or CGG RNA and itstranslated polyglycine product FMRpolyG (FMRpolyG +RNA) were used to assess fertility using breeding and superovulation studies in order to model FXPOI. Pheno typic data were collected longitudinally, and ovarian histology was examined. CGG RNA and FMRpolyG +RNA both contribute to ovarian dysfunction, albeit differently. Immunostaining shows FMRpolyG is present in oocytes and granulosa in early postnatal life and gonadotropin stimulation reveals that young RNA onlyand FMRpolyG +RNA mice ovulate fewer oocytes/female. Ovaries during ovulation (8 h post hCG administration) show impaired cumulus expansion in the preovulatoryfollicles of RNA only and FMRpolyG +RNA ovaries. With age, FMRpolyG +RNA mice exhibit declining fertility, but this reduction was not seen in RNA only mice. Cessation ofbreeding in FMRpolyG +RNA females is preceded by signiï¬cant weight gain compared to control mice, andAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1087histology shows a lack of ovulation as well as hyperplastic stroma and disorganized theca in aged ovaries. An increased incidence of cysts present in both groups of CGG expressing ovaries suggest altered steroidogenesis and is conï¬rmed by qRT PCR from whole ovary tissue collected from aged mice. Globally expressed FMRpolyG +CGG RNA leads to anovulation, altered steroidogenic pro ï¬le, and fertility decline with age, while CGG RNA only mice do not exhibit a decline in fertility or increased weight butdiminished response to superovulation and cumulus expan sion defects similar to the FMRpolyG +RNA females suggest that CGG RNA alone can affect ovarian function.

AKAP4 has been described to be required for structural and functionalintegrity of the ï¬brous sheath. We generated Akap4 knockout mice line using CRISPR Cas9 system. Cytomor phology and motility of sperms and testes were studied,conï¬rming loss of Akap4 led to abnormal sperm morphol ogy, motility and infertility. The proteomic components of testes were examined and Akap4 was found to besigniï¬cantly decreased in the Akap4 knockout mice.

Of interest are a few highly recurrent DNM associated withcongenital disorders and/or rasopathies, that have been described as sel ï¬sh mutations expanding in the male germline. We have adapted an ultra sensitive sequencing(USS) technology based on duplex barcoding to distinguish both DNA strands, thus increasing the sensitivity to one mutation in 10 7sequenced bases. This technology was applied to study the expansion of sel ï¬sh mutations in the FGFR3 gene in the male germline. Materials and Methods: A ~3000bp coding region of theFGFR3 gene including the transmembrane and the tyrosine kinase domains was sequenced with USS in two DNA sperm pools from an old and young donor group. Results: DNM with frequencies of 10â3â10â5were identi ï¬ed in 41 exonic positions, several of which have been described in congenital disorders and/or cancer. Theachondroplasia associated mutation c.1138G>A was detected at similar frequencies as the reported occurrence.1088Also, various substitutions are viable and have been reported in population data (gnomAD), albeit at lower fre quencies. Mutations found in both pools show higher fre quencies in older donors. Conclusion: Our USS method has proven to be suc cessful in detecting low frequency DNM. Also, it is animportant strategy to identify driver mutations in the male germline expanding with paternal age with potentially important health consequences.

Although thousands of genes are known to be involved in spermatogenesis, thegenetic causes behind severe spermatogenic failure remain largely unknown. De novo mutations (DNMs), that arise spontaneously in the germline or postzygotically, are knownto play a prominent role in early onset disorders with reduced ï¬tness. Here we report on the ï¬rst exome sequencing study to investigate the role of DNMs in maleinfertility. We examined and sequenced 108 patients suffering from azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (<5million sperm/ml) and their fertile parents. In total, we identi ï¬ed and validated 92 protein altering DNMs, which show an enrichment in protein network edges. Also, we found an enrichment of loss of function (LoF) variants in extremely LoF intolerant genes. Of all DNMs, 22 are likely to disrupt normal gene function and lie in genes involved insperm production such as TOPAZ1 and ODF1 . Comple mentarily, we detected de novo copy number variants in 2 patients affecting multiple genes involved in cell replicationand gamete production. Currently, we are performing replication studies in additional cohorts to identify recur rently mutated genes. Additionally, detailed phenotypic re evaluation of patient phenotype, immuno ï¬uorescence stainings of patient material and genetic screens using Drosophila Melanogaster are being performed to more conï¬dently link genes affected by a DNM to male infertility.

The etiology in large proportion of infertile men still remains unknown. Therefore, to identify novel genetic factors we selected CETN1 based on our exome sequencing studies, sequenced it in large cohort of case controls and performed various functional studies. Materials and Methods: We performed exome sequen cing of 44 idiopathic infertile men. CETN1 was one of the seven potential candidates identi ï¬ed ; hence, we further sequenced CETN1 in 1200 infertile men and 900 fertile men. Functional characterization of two variants from CETN1 was performed using various biophysical (CD, 2D HSQC etc.,), cell biology (using different cell lines andiPSC) approaches and luciferase assays. Quantitative esti mation of Centrin 1 in oligospermic men with IVF failure history was done by ELISA. Results: Two variants; rs61734344 (p. Met72Thr) and rs367716858 (5 â²UTR) showed signi ï¬cant association with infertility (p values: 8.46e 06 and 0.001, respectively).Biophysical studies showed that mutation p. Met72Thr alters calcium binding af ï¬nity and calcium induced structural changes in Centrin 1. Somatic cells and differentiated iPSCover expressing p. Met72Thr showed higher multipolar cells, fragmented nuclei and cell death. Studies using RPE cell lines showed that p. Met72Thr affects ciliary assemblydynamics and cell proliferation. Whereas, the 5 â²UTR mutation leads to over expression of Centrin 1 due to loss of potential methylation site. Further, the reproductiveoutcome was markedly affected in patients with higher levels of Centrin 1 protein in their sperm centrosomes. This is the ï¬rst study to demonstrate the role of CETN1 in human spermatogenesis and male fertility. D. V.S. Sudhakar: None. S. Jaishankar: None. R. Phanindranath: None. A. Pawar: None. V.

31362,"AustraliaIntroduction: Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are conditions affecting development of the gonads or genitalia. Variants in two key genes, SRY and its target SOX9 , are an established cause of 46,XY DSD, but the genetic basis of many DSDs remains unknown. SRY mediated SOX9 upregulation in the early gonad is crucial for testisdevelopment, yet the regulatory elements underlying this have not been identi ï¬ed in humans. Methods: We analysed copy number variations (CNVs) in the upstream regulatory region of SOX9 in DNA from patients with DSD, allowing us to de ï¬ne several minimal critical regions for sex reversal. Results: We rede ï¬ned the upstream regulatory landscape of human SOX9. Using new patient data, we re ï¬ned the 32.5 kb XYSR and 24 kb RevSex intervals and analysedthese genomic regions using bioinformatic and luciferase tiling approaches, to identify three putative enhancers 5 â²of SOX9. In cell based reporter assays these enhancersresponded to different combinations of testis speci ï¬c reg ulators including SRY, SF1 and SOX9 itself. When com bined, all three enhancers show synergistic activity,signiï¬cantly increasing their individual enhancer activity. In vivo , deletion of these three enhancers in mice resulted in different outcomes ranging from: no apparent effect toreduced Sox9 transcription and complete sex reversal. Conclusion: This is the ï¬rst study to identify SOX9 enhancers that, when duplicated or deleted, result in 46,XXor 46,XY sex reversal, respectively. These enhancers pro vide a hitherto missing link by which SRY activates SOX9 initiation, upregulation and maintenance in humans, andestablish SOX9 enhancer mutations as a signi ï¬cant cause of DSD.

Smedley2 1EMBL EBI, Cambridge, United Kingdom,2Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom The identi ï¬cation of the causal variants of rare genetic diseases from voluminous patient sequencing data is anongoing challenge. Here we combine cellular essentiality screen data with in vivo organismal gene essentiality from1090the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium to aid in the prioritization of candidate disease genes. We categor ized genes within a spectrum of phenotypic effects, and identi ï¬ed a Developmental Lethal (DL) category, which we deï¬ne as genes not essential for cell survival but required for organismal development. With mouse viability dataavailable for ~4,900 genes, 764 genes fall into the DL category. We found that this category presents a signi ï¬cant overrepresentation of Mendelian disease genes (OMIM andOrphanet associations, 2.5 fold increase odds), and an even higher enrichment (3.2 fold increase) for human genes associated with developmental disorders (from the Deci phering Developmental Disorders Study, DDD). We further investigated DL genes that were: (i) not described as associated with human disease by OMIM, Orphanet orDDD; and (ii) highly intolerant to LoF mutations, comprising 164 genes. Of these, 24 genes overlap with those containing heterozygous functional de novo variantsin undiagnosed cases from the DDD study (DDD Research Variants). Further investigation of this set of genes is ongoing by comparing the clinical features of develop mental disorders with homozygous and heterozygous knockout mouse models, to identify potential disease variants in cases with undiagnosed developmental disorders.

We have previously reported that knock inmice ( Braf Q241R /+) expressing the CFC syndrome associated mutation, Braf Q241R, showed growth retardation because of gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, other factorsassociated with growth retardation, including chondrogen esis and endocrinological pro ï¬le, have not been examined. Here, we show that 3 and 4 week old Braf Q241R /+mice have decreased body weight and length, as well as reduced growth plate width in the proximal tibiae. Furthermore, proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones of the growth plate were reduced in BrafQ241R /+mice compared with control mice. Immunohistological analysis revealedthat ERK activation was enhanced in hypertrophic chon drocytes in Braf Q241R /+mice. In accordance with growth retardation and reduced growth plate width, decreasedserum levels of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP 3) were observed in Braf Q241R /+ mice at 3 and 4 weeks of age. In contrast, serum growth hormone levels were comparable in control and BrafQ241R /+ mice. Treatment with C type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a stimulator of endochondral bone growth and a potentinhibitor of the FGFR3 RAF1 MEK/ERK signaling, increased body and tail lengths in control and Braf Q241R /+ mice. In conclusion, ERK activation in chondrocytes and low serum IGF 1/IGFBP 3 levels could be associated with the growth retardation observed in BrafQ241R /+mice.

CS patients present with hypertrichosis and facial anomalies alongside a varying range of cardiovascularabnormalities. To generate a critical mass patients to ï¬nd further clinical characteristics of the disease as well as to ensure a rapid progression towards future interventionalstudies we developed a standardized registry. Clinical data is obtained during annual CantÃº research clinics. CS is debilitating with no targeted therapy available. Clinicalmanagement currently involves symptomatic treatments to address second order complications such as heart failure. The off patent KATP inhibitor glibenclamide which isalready widely applied in clinic to block GOF KATP channels involved in Type 2 diabetes holds promise as a potential treatment for CS. In order to perform therapeuticdrug screening, we have developed novel CS animal models in which disease causing mutations were knocked in to the endogenous ABCC9 loci in zebra ï¬sh and mice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Both models recapitu late key cardiovascular features of CS which signi ï¬cantly reverse after glibenclamide administration. Hypercontracti lity and abnormally high output were reversed in zebra ï¬sh larvae whilst cardiac hypertrophy in mice was similarly attenuated. No sustained hypoglycemia was observed afterchronic exposure to glibenclamide in mice. These results provide key pre clinical evidence for the in vivo ef ï¬cacy of glibenclamide for the treatment of CS. Hence, we intend toperform a clinical trial to test glibenclamide in CS patients.

Loss of function KMT2D variants cause Kabuki syndrome (KS), characterised by intellectual disability, typical facial dysmorphism andmultiple malformations of heart, kidneys and palate. Results: Through targeted whole exome and genome sequencing we ascertained 10 individuals with de novo orinherited missense KMT2D variants restricted to highly conserved residues within a central region predicted to form a coiled coil dimer. All individuals presented with clinicalfeatures, strikingly distinct from KS, consisting of (a) varying combinations of branchial cysts, external ear mal formations, ear pits, semi circular canal anomalies, hearingloss, microphthalmia, lacrimal duct problems, choanal atresia, absent/hypoplastic nipples and hypothyroidism; (b) absence of typical facial features of KS; and (c) normaldevelopment in most individuals. KMT2D expression levels inï¬broblast cells from two affected individuals were not1092altered compared to controls. However, mutant ï¬broblast had slightly decreased proliferation and migration compared to controls. The DNA methylation pattern in peripheral blood samples derived from affected individuals showed a speciï¬c signature distinct from that of KS. Circular dichroism performed on the puri ï¬ed KMT2D coiled coil domain showed that alpha helical secondary structure in the wild type protein was perturbed by the missense variants. Conclusion: We show that a restricted spectrum of pathogenic KMT2D missense variants results in a novel malformation disorder distinct from KS.

We identi ï¬ed a cluster of de novo truncating mutations in MN1 in a cohort of 21 individuals with strikingly similar dysmorphic facial features, especially midface hypoplasia, and intellectual disability with severe expressive language delay. MN1 is comprised of two exons. All mutations, including the recurrent variant p. Arg1295* observed in 8/19 probands, fall in the terminal exon or the extreme 3 â²region of exon 1, and are therefore predicted to result in escapefrom nonsense mediated mRNA decay. This was con ï¬rmed inï¬broblasts from three individuals. The C terminal 20 amino acids of MN1, which are lacking in all patients, arevery highly conserved amongst vertebrate species, suggest ing an important role for the C terminal tail in MN1 function. Previous studies have described large deletions ofa region encompassing MN1 and other genes in individuals with variable neurodevelopmental anomalies and non speciï¬c facial features (dissimilar to the facial gestalt of the patients reported here). We propose that the condition described here for the ï¬rst time, MEningioma 1 C terminal Truncation (MECT) syndrome, is not due to MN1 haploinsuf ï¬ciency but rather is the result of dominantly acting C terminally truncated MN1 protein. In summary, our data show that MN1 plays a critical role in human craniofacial and brain development. C. T. Gordon: None. C. Mak: None. D. Doherty: None. A. Lin: None. N. Vegas: None. M. Cho: None.

Molecular etiologies are stillpoorly elucidated. Together with new insights on the role for lysosomal signaling in embryonic stem cell differentia tion, mutations in the X linked transcription factor TFE3 have recently been reported in ï¬ve patients with PM. Functional analysis suggested these mutations to result in ectopic nuclear gain of function Tfe3 alleles. Material and Methods: Subsequent datasharing allowed the clustering of de novo TFE3 variants identi ï¬ed by exome sequencing or TFE3 targeted sequencing on DNA extracted from leucocytes in patients referred for syndromic intel lectual disability with or without PM. Results: We describe the clinical and molecular data of theï¬ve previously published patients and six additional individuals harboring a de novo missense TFE3 mutation. The seven females and four males presented with pigmen tation anomalies on Blaschko âs lines, severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, metabolic anomalies (hepatomegaly, obesity, hypoglycemia), growth retardation and recogniz able facial dysmorphism with progressive coarsening. The mutation was at a mosaic state in two male patients. Two of the eight identi ï¬ed mutations were localized in exon 3, six in exon 4; three were recurrent mutations. Conclusion: This series of 11 individuals further delineates the speci ï¬c storage disorder like phenotype with pigmentary mosaicism ascribed to de novo TFE3 missense mutation in exons 3 and 4. It con ï¬rms the identi ï¬cation of a novel X linked condition associated with mosaicism anddysregulation within the mTOR pathway, as well as a link between lysosomal signaling and human development.

Here, we describe DTYMK deï¬ciency as the cause of a novel vanishing brain disease in two unrelated patients. DTYMK encodes TMPK (thymidylate monophosphate kinase), a key enzyme in dTTP biosynthesis. The clinicalphenotype is characterized by microcephaly, no growth in length and severe developmental delay. MRI revealed extreme loss of white matter in the cerebral cortex andabsence of basal ganglia. Two compound heterozygous variants in DTYMK were detected in the ï¬rst patient whereas a second patient carried a (third) homozygousvariant in DTYMK . TMPK activity was undetectable in patient ï¬broblasts and a proliferation defect that was absent in control cells was observed. Homozygous dtymk mutant zebra ï¬sh show microcephaly, developmental delay and massive brain edema. TMPK activity in mutant zebra ï¬sh conï¬rmed that the allele represents a loss of function. Furthermore, a striking reduction of cell proliferation was detected in the brain of mutant zebra ï¬sh larvae, as well as an impairment of the DNA damage repair mechanism. These similarities between the human and zebra ï¬sh phenotype strongly suggest a causal link between TMPK deï¬ciency and neurodegeneration. Current research is focused on the identi ï¬cation of the compensatory mechan ism and the pathogenic mechanism underlying the vanish ing white matter but reduced proliferation and a de ï¬cient DNA repair mechanism are suspected to play major roles. In summary, by combining genetic and biochemicalapproaches in a cellular and a zebra ï¬sh model we identi ï¬ed loss of function in DTYMK as the cause of a novel vanishing brain disease. J. M.

Materials and Methods: linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing, lipidomics analysis. Results: We describe an autosomal recessive neurologi cal disorder affecting consanguineous kindred. All fouraffected individuals, born at term following normal preg nancies, had mild to severe intellectual disability, spastic quadriplegia, scoliosis and epilepsy in most, with no dys morphic features. Brain MRI demonstrated leukodystrophy with abnormal hyperintense signal in the periventricular perioccipital region and thinning of corpus callosum. Notably, affected individuals were asymptomatic at early infancy and developed normally until the age of 8â18 months, when deterioration ensued. Homozygosity mapping identi ï¬ed a single 8.7 Mb disease associated locus on chromosome 1q41 â1q42.13 between rs1511695 and rs537250 (two point LOD score 2.1). Whole exomesequencing identi ï¬ed within this locus a single disease associated homozygous mutation in DEGS1 , encoding C4 dihydroceramide desaturase, an enzyme of the ceramidesynthesis pathway. The missense mutation, segregating within the family as expected for recessive heredity, affects an evolutionary conserved amino acid of both isoforms ofDEGS1 and was not found in a homozygous state in ExAC and gnomAD databases or in 300 ethnically matchedAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1095individuals. Analysis of whole blood of affected individuals demonstrated augmented levels of dihydroceramides, dihydrosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine 1 phosphate and dihydrosphingomyelins with reduced levels of ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine 1 phosphate and mono hexosylceramides, as expected in malfunction of C4 dihydroceramide desaturase. Conclusion: We demonstrate that a mutation in DEGS1 causes a sphingolipidosis presenting at age 8 â18 months with severe leukodystrophy, implying future treatment modalities for this severe neurologic disease.

Lille, Lille, France Introduction: Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare, genetic diseases. Here, weidenti ï¬ed a novel CDG caused by hemizygous mutations in the X linked MAGT1 . Patient 1 and 2, both boys, present with intellectual and developmental disability. Furthermore,a third MAGT1 de ï¬cient patient (P3) with an immunode ï¬ciency characterised by Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infec tions was identi ï¬ed. MAGT1 is a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, with an impor tant role in N glycosylation. However, mutations in MAGT1 have been described to cause an immunode ï¬ciency (XMEN), characterised by EBV infections. These studies claim that MAGT1 is a Mg 2+transporter. Methods: Protein expression levels of OST subunits were evaluated in patient and CRISPR K. O. cell lines. Radi olabelling of glycoproteins was performed to detect N glycosylation defects. Results: Protein levels of MAGT1 were unaffected for P1 (missense mutation) and absent for P2 and P3 (nonsensemutations). Expression of TUSC3, the homologue protein of MAGT1, was increased in all patient derived ï¬broblasts. By radiolabelling we observed that the patient ï¬broblasts have a mild glycosylation defect. This is in line with reports showing that enhanced expression of TUSC3 mitigates the MAGT1 defect. Interestingly, glycoproteins were stronglyhypoglycosylated in P3 lymphocytes, as they don ât express TUSC3. Lastly, complementation experiments with mutated MAGT1 did not rescue the defective glycosylation inMAGT1 / TUSC3 / HEK293 cells, indicating that all three mutations are pathogenic. Conclusion: We showed that glycosylation is impaired in all patients. Hence, we delineate MAGT1 CDG as a novel glycosylation disorder associated with two different clinical phenotypes.

It is caused by mutations in ï¬ve genes: LDLR , APOB ,PCSK9 ,APOE, LDLRAP1 . Other FH causing genes remain to be characterized. The aim of this study conducted in a large French family and in unrelated French hypercholesterolemic probands is to identify newFH causing genes which can explain the mutation negative cases.1096Materials: The studied FH family (20 members including 6 affected over 3 generations) and probands were recruited through the French FH Research Network and mutations in LDLR ,APOB ,PCSK9, APOE were excluded. A whole exome sequencing (WES) was realized in 3 affected members of the family and Sanger sequencing in the 84probands. Analysis of variant effects was assessed in silico. Then we investigated the activity of the candidate gene and its variants in vitro. Wildtype and mutant plasmids wereconstructed and transfected into HEK293T cells. We determined protein expression and LDL uptake by FACS analysis. Results: WES identi ï¬ed a heterozygous variant segre gating in the family in LRP6 (p.(Val1382Phe)). Four other rare and disease causing variants in this gene were found in4 unrelated probands (p.(Tyr972Cys), p.(Thr1479Ile), p. (Tyr1584Asn), p.(Ser1612Phe)). Functional studies showed that two variants decrease signi ï¬cantly the expression of LRP6 at the cell surface and increase slightly but not sig niï¬cantly LDL uptake. However, the expression of LDL receptor was not affected by any variant. Conclusion: This study brings new data concerning the role of LRP6 in LDL uptake.

Knock out of Gnb5 in mice results in structural andfunctional abnormalities of the brain. However, little is known about the role of Gnb5 in heart sinus conduction. Notably, all IDDCA individuals present heart bradycardia. Here we show that Gnb5 inhibitory signaling is essential for parasympathetic control of heart rate. We monitored i) heart electrophysiology in homozygous (KO, n ,8), heterozy gous (HET, n ,8) and wild type (WT, n ,7) mice using in vivo ECG telemetry, and ii) cardiac function by echocardiography. KO mice were smaller than WT andHET mice, and had a smaller heart, but exhibited better cardiac function, as judged by increased fractional short ening and ejection fraction. Whereas baseline ECG was notdifferent between groups, KO mice treated with carbachol (CCh), a parasympathomimetic, presented signi ï¬cant CCh induced bradycardia. In contrast, the anti parasympatheticdrug atropine had the same effect in KO, HET and WT mice. KO and WT showed similar responses to atenolol and isoprotenerol, respectively, agonist and antagonist of theÎ² adrenergic activity, suggesting that sympathetic modula tion of the cardiac stimulation is not altered. Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of negative regulation on theinhibitory G protein signaling causes heart rate perturba tions in Gnb5 KO mice. This effect is mainly driven by impaired parasympathetic activity. We anticipate thatunravelling the mechanistic of Gnb5 signaling in the autonomic control of the heart will pave the way for future drug screening. P. De Nittis: None. A. Sarre: None. J. Chrast: None.

PE is the most abundant membrane lipid that is enriched in the CNS. Results: We identi ï¬edï¬ve individuals from four families with biallelic PCYT2 variants via exome sequencing. One patient had compound heterozygous missense variantswhile all others possessed an identical homozygous last exon nonsense variant. All patients had mild to severe global developmental delay, progressive spastic tetraparesis,seizures, regression and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Nystagmus and poor visual acuity were reported in four individuals. In patient ï¬broblasts, mRNA levels were nor mal whilst ET protein levels and enzyme activity were signiï¬cantly decreased (but not absent). In silico analysis of missense variants showed that the substitutions probablyaffected binding, catalysis and protein stability. Hypo morphic G0 PCYT2 zebra ï¬sh generated using the CRISPR Cas9 system had abnormal tail ï¬n morphology, whereas zebra ï¬sh with complete knockout of the gene were incompatible with life. Lipidomic analysis of patient ï¬bro blasts demonstrated profound abnormalities in neutraletherlipid and etherphospholipids and revealed that in ET de ï¬ciency, the phosphatidyl serine decarboxylase route is used to synthesize plasmalogens. Patient plasmalipidomics showed signi ï¬cant accumulation of phosphati dylcholine[O]. Conclusion: Hypomorphic biallelic PCYT2 variants cause a novel syndromic progressive neurological disorder and the complete loss of ET function is likely incompatible with life. Lipidomic abnormalities in patient tissues couldbe used as a biomarker facilitating diagnosis and inter pretation of variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance.

C07 Gene editing and reproductionC07.1 Experts âopinions on genome editing in humans: a collective construction of a disruptive technology V. Romano, H. C. Howard Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden Germ line genome editing (GLGE) is a highly controversial matter, tending to divide the expert community revolving around it. To date, very few studies have explored in depth the views of expert stakeholders. To help ï¬ll this gap, we interviewed 20 expert stakeholders in genome editing (academic laboratory and clinical researchers, bioethicists, lawyers, patient advocates) from Europe, North America,China and Japan. In our semi guided interviews, we posed, among others, questions addressing legitimacy, roles and responsibilities, engagement of the public about differentuses, and future scenarios in so doing constructing a collective idea of what GLGE is and could be. About legitimate uses, we found that many stakeholders areskeptical about the need to use GLGE because of ethical implications, environmental risks and the existence of more safer alternatives. Roles and responsibilities are called to behorizontal and diffused as much as possible to everybody (through adequate representation). The participation of the wider public is considered essential for transgenerationalethical dilemmas. Future scenarios are depicted as negative for, above all, women and women âs bodies, the meaning and actual impact of parenting, and the creation of widerinequalities between social classes. In general, we under stood that certain views are common among experts, such as the extreme caution which should guide the path from thelab to clinical trials. However, there are also many differences in perceived priorities, based on the anticipation of different cost bene ï¬t balances and on the diverse predictions of GLGE âs development and its potential impact on human kind.

In the future, non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD), germline gene modi ï¬cation (GGM) and somatic gene modi ï¬cation (SGM) might become available. This study explores if, and how, availability of possible future reproductive options would in ï¬uence couples â decision making. Interviews (n ,25) were conducted with couples with a known increased risk of having a child with a geneticcondition who received genetic counselling at one Dutch Clinical Genetics Centre between 2013 â2018. For couples, factors currently in ï¬uencing decision making for or against PND or PGD (e.g. attitude towards pregnancy termination, the impact of procedure) also played a role when discussing the new reproductive technologies. Couples were generally positive about NIPD as this would be more safe and enables earlier testing compared to PND. However, some who were against pregnancy terminationwould still prefer PGD. The perceived burden of PGD, embryo disposal, and increasing opportunities of having a âhealthy âembryo were considerations in favour of GGM. However, some considered GGM as unsafe, feared misuse and âslippery slope âscenarios. SGM was generally not considered an option to anticipate on, since the affectedchild would still be born and subjected to treatment. Genetically at risk couples have mixed feelings: NIPD and GGM were more positively evaluated than SGM. Theresults suggest that shifts in use towards new technologies can be expected. Users âperspectives should be addressed for responsible implementation. Grant: Amsterdam Repro duction and Development Research Institute I. van Dijke: None. P. Lakeman: None. I. B.

Internationally, policymakers, scientists and media have called for a global conversation including the voices of thepublic and relevant stakeholders. Our study contributes to this need by investigating the GLGE views of the sickle cell disease (SCD) community and genetic professionals. Methods: In 2017, we utilized a mixed methods approach, involving an original educational video on CRISPR genome editing, surveys, and 15 focus groups ofUnited States based SCD community members: six patient, six parent, and three physician groups. The ï¬ndings were compared to an international survey of genetic professionalsconducted from 2016 â2017. Results: Compared to genetics professionals, where 48.2% found GLGE to be morally acceptable, fewer in theSCD community supported GLGE (24.0%, p < 0.0001). The SCD disease community saw the promise of GLGE as a potential cure for the disease; however, many expressedconcerns about misuse of the technology. Conclusion: As discourse surrounding GLGE advances, it is crucial that we engage disease communities whose livescould be altered by these interventions in the policy con versations with researchers, bioethicists, and policymakers.

Since April 2017, all pregnant women can choose between NIPT, First trimester Combined Testing(FCT) (both ~ â¬175) and no test, within the TRIDENT 2 study. Due to the favorable characteristics of NIPT there has been a strong demand for implementation. However,concerns have been raised regarding the impact on informed decision making. This study evaluates women âs perspec tives on the offer of NIPT. A nationwide questionnaire was completed by n ,752 pregnant women, after receiving counseling for prenatal screening by a certi ï¬ed counselor but before testing, assessing: test preferences, attitudes, perceived pressure to test, knowledge and deliberation. Of the respondents, 79% expressed a preference for NIPT, 2% for FCT, 17% no test and 2% were unsure. Main reason for preferring NIPT was: âhigh accuracy compared to FCTâ(29%). Primary reason to refrain from testing was: âevery child is welcome â(27%). Few women (<5%) experienced societal or provider pressure (not) to test. Half (53%) thought that children with Down syndrome were lessaccepted in society. Nearly all women (97%) reported that they made a well informed decision. Most women (94%) had adequate prenatal screening knowledge ( â¥4/7 correct questions). Additional measures of informed choice will be presented. Theï¬ndings indicate that pregnant women experience little pressure to test, have adequate knowledge and a high level of perceived informed decision making with NIPT offered within a governmentally supported screeningprogram.

31378,"prenatal screening (FTS) for trisomies 21, 18 and 13 is offered to all pregnant women in the Netherlands. NIPT using whole genome sequencing allows for an expansion ofthe scope of FTS and the introduction of NIPT gives rise to ethical and societal concerns about deliberated decision making, pressure to engage in screening and possible lackof equal access due to the ï¬nancial contribution ( â¬175) to NIPT. We explored the opinions and experiences of pregnant women, who were offered FTS, about theseconcerns and about the possibility of a broadened scope. Nineteen pregnant women representing a diversity of backgrounds were interviewed using a semi structuredinterview guide. Eight women (42.1%) did not opt for prenatal screening and eleven (57.9%) did (NIPT ,4, combined test ,7). Women experienced a free choice to accept or decline prenatal screening, despite sometimes receiving advice from others. Prior to pre test counselling, some women had already deliberated about what anabnormal test result would mean to them. Others accepted or declined FTS without deliberation. The current Dutch policy of requiring a co payment was acceptable to some,who believed it functioned as a threshold to think carefully about FTS. Others were concerned that a ï¬nancial threshold would lead to unequal access to screening. Finally, pregnantwomen found it dif ï¬cult to formulate opinions on the scope of FTS, because of lacking knowledge. Life expectancy, severity and treatability were considered important criteriafor the inclusion of a condition in NIPT. I. M. Bakkeren: None. A. Kater Kuipers: None. E. M. Bunnik: None. A. T.J. I.

31379,"1Centre of Genomics and Policy, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,2UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, Montreal, QC, Canada Current advances and innovation in assisted reproductive technologies aim to promote the health and well being of future children. They offer the possibility to select embryoswith the greatest potential of being born healthy (e.g. preimplantation genetic testing) and may someday correct1100faulty genes responsible for heritable diseases in the embryo (e.g. human germline genome modi ï¬cation HGGM). Most laws and policy statements surrounding HGGM refer to the notion of âserious âas a core parameter in determining what genetic conditions should be targeted by these technologies. The literature suggests that it is unrealistic to expect todeï¬ne the concept universally, but that when employed it must be quali ï¬ed and consider patient and physician perspectives. Yet, this notion remains unde ï¬ned, rendering its application vague and decision making subjective and arbitrary. We begin by presenting two general conceptions ofâdisease âand âhealth â: the objectivist (i.e. based on biological facts) and constructivist (i.e. based on human values) frameworks. We then consider the rationale for a rights based approach (e.g. right to science and right to thehighest attainable health). The basic challenge is sorting out whether and to what extent social conditions have a role in helping to de ï¬ne what quali ï¬es as a âserious âdisease and whether the classi ï¬cation of âserious âisï¬exible, depending on shifting social conditions and landscapes. Ultimately, decisions about what constitutes a âserious âcondition would be contextualized to the individual but should also give appropriate weight and consideration to the broader implications for the notion of âhealth âand âdisease âin society.

Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of 129 493 pregnancies examined during 2010 â2017 in Stockholmcounty, including children born with a postnatally detected chromosome aberration. Results: There were 872 (0.7%) chromosome aberrations in the cohort. Common trisomies (21,18 and 13) or sex chromosome aberrations (SCA) constituted 86% of these and 14% were atypical chromosome aberrations (AChrA).If an invasive test were offered to the 5779 (4.5%) women with an increased risk for a trisomy, 84% of all clinically signiï¬cant chromosome aberrations and 55% of all AChrAs would be detected. In total 93% of the chromosome aber rations were detectable with NIPT (trisomies/SCAs). Investigating the 2323 (1.8%) women with the highest risk(â¥1:50) after cFTS, 27% had a chromosome aberration, 2.0% had an AChrA requiring an invasive test for diagnosis. Conclusion: If only analysis for common trisomies and SCA is offered after cFTS, the residual risk for an AChrA in women with a risk â¥1:200 is 1.0% (55/5779). Taking into account the cases resulting in a miscarriage/IUFD and thosedetected due to malformation on ultrasound, the residual risk for a postnatal diagnosis of an AChrA is 0.7% (41/ 5779). That might be seen as a low residual risk, butlooking from another angle 74% (41/55) of the AChrAs will remain undetected using such an approach. E. Iwarsson: None. P. Conner: None.",2019

However, this population wide average does not re ï¬ect a family âs individual risk: while most couples have a negligible risk, for a minority, the DNM is present in multiple parental gonadal cells (mosaicism) and the risk of a future offspring being affected is up to 50%. The PREGCARE ( Precision Genetic Counselling and Reproduction) study aims to develop a systematic strategy to identify high risk mosaic cases and provide families witha personalised assessment of transmission risk. Individual risk strati ï¬cation is achieved through analysis of 14 tissue samples of various embryonic origin from the family trio(including a father âs semen sample) using ultra deep Illu mina sequencing (~30,000x) and DNM haplotype phasing via Nanopore long read sequencing, to determine the par ental origin. We present data from the 20 ï¬rst families to illustrate the power of this approach. While we detected instances ofmosaicism, such as a maternally originating KIF11 muta tion (VAF ,0.1â0.5%), for most families, the DNM was undetectable by deep sequencing of parental samples(including sperm). Next, long read haplotyping permitted to single out DNMs of paternal origin, con ï¬rming that these families have an extremely low risk ( â¤0.1%) of having another affected child. Given our current understanding of mosaicism, this strategy should reassure up to ~75% of couples that theirrecurrence risk is negligible. The ability to provide perso nalised transmission risk prior to conception is likely to impact upon clinical practice and family planning decisions. U. B. Abdullah: None. M. Bernkopf: None. N.

Chen1 1BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China,2School of Bioscience and Bioengineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China Introduction: Next generation sequencing (NGS) âbased cellâfree DNA (cfDNA) analysis has been widely adopted for non âinvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for fetal chromosome aneuploidy and monogenic diseases through different experiment strategies. We developed a newsequencing method embracing both advantages of targeted and genome âwide sequencing, so that it can simultaneously screen for fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and monogenic diseases in a noninvasive manner. Methods: The novel method, called TAGs âseq, integrates a multiplex PCR step into the genome âwide NIPS library construction to simultaneously amplify whole genome and target region in one tube. After NGS, the genome âwide region displays a low sequencing depth (0.1 â0.5Î§) and the target regions an ultra âhigh depth (>1000 Î§), which were sufï¬cient for detecting chromosome aneuploidy and singe base mutations, respectively. Results: We validated in âblind in 517 plasma samples with previously con ï¬rmed outcomes of fetal. The TAGs âseq NIPS identi ï¬ed 23 cases of common aneuploidy, 9 cases of fetal de novo mutations, 27 cases of maternal monogenic diseases carrier and 458 cases of normal controls. Fetal results were concordant to the invasive diagnostic results,while maternal carrier results were concordant to sanger sequencing results. Conclusion: We developed a novel TAGs âseq NIPS, which exploited whole âgenome sequencing data and tar geted sequencing data, providing a convenient, low âcost, and expandable solution to detect fetal chromosome aneu ploidy and de novo mutations, as well as maternal carrier of monogenic diseases in a single experiment.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ï¬rst benchmarked our bioinfor matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conï¬rmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ï¬rst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B. B.

However, robustNIPD of autosomal recessive conditions has proven more challenging as this requires detection of fetal inheritance of a maternal allele from a mixed maternal fetal pool of cellfree DNA. The autosomal recessive disorder sickle cell disease is the most common referral indication for molecular genetic invasive prenatal diagnosis in the UK,however, NIPD is not yet available. Methods: We use targeted next generation sequencing of cell free DNA from maternal plasma to diagnose fetal sicklecell disease based on a relative mutation dosage approach. No paternal or proband samples are required. Unique molecular identi ï¬ers (UMIs) were incorporated into library preparation to enable accurate quanti ï¬cation of mutant and wildtype allele reads. Results: 24 plasma samples from pregnant sickle cell disease carriers were analysed, of which 20 were con cordant with the established genotype; two with low fetal fraction were inconclusive and two were discordant. Insilico size selection of cfDNA fragments was found to enhance the fetal fraction for all samples, and modi ï¬cations to UMI capture improved diagnostic accuracy. Samplesfrom as early as eight weeks gestation were successfully genotyped. Conclusion: We demonstrate that NIPD for sickle cell disease is approaching clinical utility.

Materials and Methods : We retrieved all results of chromosomal microarray after chorionic villus samplingfrom January 1 st2011 to November 30th2017 registered in our local laboratory database. Mosaic results from uncul tured chorionic villus samples and follow up with amnio centeses, fetal tissue or postnatal blood were studied and matched with clinical data from The Danish Fetal Medicine Database. Results : The prevalence of mosaicism in CVS was 93/ 2,288, 4.1% (95%CI: 3.3 â5.0 %) of which 16 cases (17.2%, 95%CI: 10.5 â26.7%) concerned submicroscopic copy number variations (CNVs) <10 megabases (Mb). Follow up analysis was performed in 62 cases. True fetal mosaicism (TFM) was con ï¬rmed in 7/38, 18.4%, when mosaicism involved whole chromosome aneuploidy and in 6/24 cases, 25.0%, when involving a CNV ( p,0.59). Mean birth weight z score was higher in cases of con ï¬ned placental mosaicism for a CNV (0.21) than cases involving whole chromosomes ( â0.74) ( p,0.02). Conclusion : Prevalence of mosaicism in CVS is sig niï¬cantly higher after CMA on uncultured cells than after conventional karyotyping. The risk of TFM is equally high in cases of mosaicism for CNVs and whole chromosomes. I. Lund: None. N. Becher: None. E. Vestergaard: None. R. Christensen: None. O. Petersen: None. E.

31386,"States Hundreds of thousands of cancer patients have had their tumors sequenced to identify clinically actionable muta tions. This activity has produced valuable research dataleading to signi ï¬cant discoveries in basic and translational domains. Unfortunately, the targeted nature of tumor sequencing precludes powerful interrogation of germline somatic interactions. To address this shortcoming we developed a computational approach to infer genome wide germline variation, including HLA, TCR/BCR, and micro bial sequences, from off target sequencing reads. We applied our method to the DFCI PROFILE cohort (n>20,000), producing the world âs largest germline somatic data set by over an order of magnitude. Levering this resource, we test for associations between germline and somatic variation. Speci ï¬cally, for the mutational burden in each PROFILE target gene as well for total mutational burden (TMB), we conduct association, heritability, popu lation prevalence, and polygenic risk score association tests. Our completed analysis of the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) sub cohort has already produced strongly sig niï¬cant associations between germline and somatic events. We identify over forty signi ï¬cant germline associations (p value < 5e 8) to mutations in oncogenes including BRCA1, ALK, DNMT3A, EPHA3/5, GLI2, as well total mutationalburden. We estimate heritability over 60% for multiple genes including BRCA1, EPHA3/5. We show that asian genetic ancestry is associated with EGFR and KRASmutations. Finally, we show that polygenic risk for lung cancer subtypes is associated to mutations in speci ï¬c genes and total mutational burden. These results demonstrate thatgermline variation is a major contributor to the dynamics of somatic mutations and cancer outcomes. N. Zaitlen: None. S. Mangul: None. A. Gusev: None.",2019

The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of germline TP53 alterations in ACC from a large series of 147 Frenchpatients (98 children, 49 adults). Sanger sequencing and QMPSF screening for genomic rearrangements revealed a deleterious germline TP53 alteration in 53 cases (36%), among which only 32 (60%) had a familial history suggestive of LFS. Re analysis of 55 negative cases, using NGS performed at high depth, subsequently identi ï¬ed 2 additional cases of mosaic mutations. The mutation detection rate was 49% in children and 14% in adults, and reached 72% in female patients presenting with an ACCbefore 2 years of age. Among 16 ACC patients treated for a secondary tumour, 12 carried a germline TP53 alteration. p. (Arg158His) and p.(Arg337His) mutations were recurrentand the majority of the alterations were missense mutations without dominant negative effect. This contrasts with the general distribution of germline TP53 alterations character ized by the predominance of dominant negative missense mutations with higher penetrance and con ï¬rms that most of the germline TP53 alterations detected in ACC patients are associated with a lower penetrance. This study shows that germline TP53 alterations are the main cause of ACC, in particular in childhood, which is probably explained by acritical role of p53 in the development of the adrenal cortex. These data justify ensuring an exhaustive analysis of TP53 in all ACC cases, independently of the familial history. M. Renaux Petel: None. F. Charbonnier: None. I. Tournier: None. G. Lienard: None.

In a cohort of 39patients, next generation sequencing of 52 cancer driver genes on cell free DNA was able to pick up clones responsible for disease progression in 60% of cases. Eachtumor had a mean of 1,3 mutated genes with 1 â3 range. Disease progression was associated with an increased levels of cfDNA.

One or fewâsniper âclones drive progression and the molecular pro ï¬le has a weak correlation with the primary tumor. Single driver mutations in TP53 remain the main target of a not yetdeveloped speci ï¬c therapy in most tumors such as breast, ovarian, uterine, lung, gastric cancers and glioblastoma. Among the actionable mutations, PIK3CA were found notonly in breast cancers but also in uterine carcinoma, Sezary syndrome and glioblastoma, pinpointing the needs of speciï¬c trials in these tumors.

Many of these alterations are strongly associated with speci ï¬c gene expression and DNA methylation patterns that can be used for ALL subtype classi ï¬cation. Amongst the Nordic BCP ALL cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2012, subtype deï¬ning aberrations were not detected at diagnosis in approximately 25% of cases, representing a large group ofuncharacterized cases collectively referred to as B other. Materials and Methods: We designed and applied DNA methylation classi ï¬ers as a tool for subtype discovery in 1142 Nordic ALL patients including 284 patients with B other phenotype. Classi ï¬ers were designed for 10 recurrent ALL subtypes including the recently described DUX4 and ZNF384 rearranged BCP ALL subtypes. The classi ï¬cation results were validated by RNA sequencing for fusion gene detection and copy number analysis. Results: DNA methylation classi ï¬cation successfully assigned an unambiguous new subtype to >50% of the 284 patients in the B other group. With RNA sequencing, weveriï¬ed the DNA methylation result by identifying fusion genes involving DUX4 ,ZNF384, or MEF2D genes, fusions common in the BCR ABL1 like and ETV6 RUNX1 like groups, and fusion genes/mutations affecting PAX5 . Fur thermore, we show the clinical relevance of these new groups in Nordic ALL patients by differing event free andoverall survival rates. Conclusion: DNA methylation classi ï¬cation is a power ful tool for subtype discovery that in combination withRNA sequencing and copy number analysis enables improved delineation of the genetic alterations of previously uncharacterized BCP ALL patients.

It is suggested that additional genetic factors, such as BC associated SNPs identi ï¬ed by GWAS, modify individual BC risks. For BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, the combined effects of BC associated SNPs (polygenic risk score, PRS) have been shown to be informative for individual risk strati ï¬cation. The question arises whether PRS based risk strati ï¬cation is applicable for CHEK2 mutation carriers. We analyzed 685 female CHEK2 germline mutation carriers (464 c.1100delC and 143 carriers of other protein truncating variants, 78 individuals with pathogenic missense variants). A total of573 mutation carriers were affected by BC (474 unilateral BC, 99 bilateral BC), with a mean age at ï¬rst/secondary diagnosis of 45.7 (23 â84)/49.2 (31 â79) years, respectively. 112 mutation carriers were not affected by BC (mean age at last follow up: 53.1 years). Study design: A cohort approach including retrospective and prospective eventswas applied. Recruitment was through genetic counselling centers including index patients and relatives. Genotyping of 77 BC associated SNPs (Mavaddat et al., 2015) wasperformed by Fluidigm Â®Access Array and NGS. PRS calculation was performed according to Kuchenbaecker et al., 2017. Kaplan Meier analysis revealed that mutationcarriers within the highest PRS decile reported a signi ï¬ cantly earlier age at ï¬rst onset compared with patients within the lowest decile (P ,5e 06). Patients within the highest decile show a mean age at ï¬rst diagnosis of 43.6 (23â69) years vs. 48.7 (27 â65) years in the lowest decile (p,0.007). Thus, combined genotyping of BC associated SNPs may improve personal risk prediction for CHEK2 mutation carriers. J. Borde: None. C. Ernst: None. K. Weber Lassalle: None. D. Niederacher: None. J.

New technologies arenecessary in order to overcome these challenges. This study tested the robustness and feasibility of such technology, called IBM Watson for Genomics (WFG), which usesnatural language processing to obtain evidence based targeted therapy and clinical trial options in an automated manner. Material and Methods: 39 different types of cancer in different stages (colon, lung, gastric, myeloid leukemia, angiosarcoma, bone, thyroid and renal sarcoma)were sequenced using different options of NGS panels (Trusight 170, LMA NEOPLASMepro ï¬le, Oncomine fusion assay and Archer FusionPlex) on the HiSeq/MiSeq and S5 XL platforms of IonTorrent. The resulting data was interpreted by WFG. Results: WFG detected actionable alterations in 28 tumors. In 17%of cases WFGagreed with the treatment applied by the oncologists or detected resistance to drugs in patients who did not respond to treatment. 64% of patients whose ï¬rst line treatment failed, WFG detected alternative therapies and classi ï¬ed patients as candidates for clinical trials and/or for those pending approval. In oncohaematologicaltumors, it was possible to evaluate the genomic pro ï¬le throughout the disease (diagnosis, relapse and recurrence) as well as its clonal evolution. This approach allowed theselection of drugs that led to the maximum bene ï¬cial effect. Conclusion: Genetic characterization of tumors through NGS, complemented by evidence based therapeutic intervention options, provides accurate molecular diagnosis, tumor sub classi ï¬cation and treatment options. Additionally, this strategy offers new information to eval uate patients. I. SÃ¡nchez Guiu: None. D. Cantalapiedra: None. V. Felipe Ponce: None. S. SantillÃ¡n: None. J. GarcÃ­a: None. S. Lois: None.

We performed a genome wide association study of 14,756 rHTN cases using 24,006 controlled hypertensivesas controls (cHTN), both de ï¬ned based on drug prescription and blood pressure data from Iceland, the UK Biobank and eMERGE. We found four genome wide signi ï¬cant rHTN loci, all known blood pressure loci, and identi ï¬ed eight more rHTN loci using reported blood pressure associations as a prior. Several of the strongest hypertension variants donot show association with rHTN while others increase the risk of rHTN more than that of hypertension. Parent of origin analysis shows increased risk of rHTN associatedwith transmission by the father for three variants (rs880315 near CASZ1 , rs569550 near LSP1 and rs1006096 near1108RXFP2 ). Nine of the twelve rHTN variants associate with blood potassium levels, with the risk allele associating with lower potassium levels, and the potassium effect of blood pressure variants predicts their association with rHTN beyond their blood pressure effect. Furthermore, a genetic risk score of the rHTN variants associates with hyper aldosteronism. We also observed that, before therapy, individuals with rHTN have lower potassium levels than both normotensives and those with controlled hypertension. The most signi ï¬cant rHTN variant is in KCNK3 ,a potassium channel gene that has been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension in men and hyperaldoster onism in mice. In conclusion, we show genetic differences between hypertension and rHTN and a prominent role of mechanisms affecting potassium homeostasis for develop ment of rHTN, implicating mineralocorticoid related path ways, aldosterone in particular.

Although the associated development of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) was historically attrib uted to altered blood ï¬ow, high heritability (89%) suggests a strong genetic contribution. Incomplete penetrance and variable clinical expression hampered gene identi ï¬cation. The only established BAV/TAA gene is NOTCH1 , accoun table for less than 1%. Combined approach of copy number variation (CNV) analysis, resequencing of candidate genes and exome sequencing of families identi ï¬ed three novel candidate genes which were further validated in a large BAV/TAA cohort (n ,637). CNV analysis revealed a 89kb duplication upstream of the T box transcription factor TBX20 . Fine mapping of the duplication con ï¬rmed involvement of a TAD boundary and two of nine region overlapping Decipher patients, carrying a bigger deletion, presented with syndromic CHD. Afterresequencing, variant burden analysis strengthened the genetic evidence for TBX20 involvement in BAV/TAA (1.1%;p ,0.03). Targeted resequencing of 22 candidate genes unveiled SMAD6 as the most common BAV/TAA gene (2.5%;p , 0.002). Investigation of an additional cohort of 473 TAA patients, demonstrated that although only 14% also pre sented BAV, all novel likely pathogenic SMAD6 variants (n,7) were identi ï¬ed in BAV/TAA individuals, further consolidating the role of SMAD6 variants to the BAV/TAA aetiology. Finally, exome sequencing discovered a ROBO4 splice site mutation segregating in a BAV/TAA family. Rese quencing revealed enrichment for rare ROBO4 variants (1.8%;p ,0.04). ROBO4 silencing or mutant ROBO4 expression in endothelial cells results in impaired barrier function and a synthetic repertoire suggestive of endothelial to mesenchymal transition; concordant ï¬ndings are observed in patient aortic walls and Robo4 deï¬cient animal models.

The pathogenesis of theplaque is a dynamic process and its cellular composition is a major determinant factor in disease development. In this study, we propose a single cell RNA seq approach tocharacterize the immune cell type composition of the plaque at different disease stages from CD45 +sorted immune cells from carotid tissue. We aim to reveal the degree ofheterogeneity and variability of cell composition in plaques among individuals, its in ï¬uence in plaque development, and transcriptional differences between individuals with plaqueï¬ssuring (symptomatic) vs. asymptomatic individuals. We have sequenced 16225 single cells from 3 symptomatic and 7 asymptomatic patients (median 1152 genes; 360k readsper cell). The top highly expressed genes including MALAT1, CD74, B2M andTMSB4X were associated with atherosclerotic lesions, in ï¬ammation and adverse cardio vascular outcome. We identi ï¬ed 15 clusters of co expressed genes differentiating between immune cell subtypes at the plaque level composition with a major proportion of T cellsand macrophages, suggesting that the plaque exhibits the characteristics of a classically chronic in ï¬amed site. We identi ï¬ed 4976 differentially expressed genes among clusters suggesting the presence of a high degree of cell heterogeneity in the plaque. Moreover, Gene Ontology revealed enrichment of pathways involved in pathogenesisof inï¬ammatory diseases, apoptosis, immune response, such as NF kB and TNF.

31395,"Introduction: Loss of function variants in the angiopoietin like 3 gene ( ANGPTL3 ) have been associated with low levels of plasma lipoproteins and decreased coronary artery disease risk. We aimed to determinedetailed metabolic effects of genetically induced ANGPTL3 deï¬ciency in fasting and postprandial state. Materials and Methods: We studied individuals carry ing S17X loss of function mutation in ANGPTL3 (6 homo zygous and 32 heterozygous carriers) and 38 noncarriers. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used toquantify 225 circulating metabolic measures. We compared metabolic differences between loss of function carriers and noncarriers in fasting state and after a high fat meal. Results: In fasting, ANGPTL3 de ï¬ciency was char acterized by similar extent of reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.74 SD units lower concentrationper loss of function allele [95%CI 0.42 â1.06]) as observed for many triglyceride rich lipoprotein measures, including very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.75 [0.45 â1.05]). Within most lipoprotein subclasses, absolute levels of cholesterol were decreased more than triglycerides, result ing in the relative proportion of cholesterol being reducedwithin triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, beta hydroxybutyrate was elevated (0.55 [0.21 â0.89]). Homozygous ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers showed essentially no postprandial increase in triglyceride rich lipoproteins and fatty acids, without evi dence for adverse compensatory metabolic effects. Conclusion: In addition to overall triglyceride and low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering effects, ANGPTL3 deï¬ciency results in reduction of cholesterol proportion within triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers had elevated ketone body production, suggesting enhanced hepatic fattyacid beta oxidation. The detailed metabolic pro ï¬le in human knockouts of ANGPTL3 reinforces inactivation of ANGPTL3 as a promising therapeutic target for decreasingcardiovascular risk. E. Tikkanen: A.

Although these discoveries rely on genetic variation present across individuals, association studies have overwhelminglybeen performed in populations of European descent. In light of differential genetic architecture between populations, biased representation in research can exacer bate existing disease and health care disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they are at a low frequency or completely absent in European populations, especially astheï¬eld shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population speci ï¬c. More concerning, the effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derivedin one population will not accurately extrapolate to other populations. Herein, we describe our recent work of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, where we have conducted a GWAS of 26 cardio metabolic phenotypes in 49,839 non European individuals. We identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known cardiometabolic loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalog associations across these traits. Our datashows strong evidence of effect size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantialbeneï¬ts for ï¬ne mapping using diverse cohorts, and insights into clinical implications. We fear that the lack of repre sentation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. Thus, we strongly advocate for continued, large genome wide efforts indiverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities. G. L. Wojcik: None. M. Graff: None. K.

Methods: We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 141 lipid species in 2,181 individuals, followed by phenome wide scans (PheWAS) with 23 CVDend points in >500,000 individuals from the Finnish and UK Biobanks. We also determined (1) how heritable are lipid species and do they share genetic components and (2)could we gain mechanistic insights into lipid metabolism. Results: SNP based heritabilities for lipid species ranged from 10 â54%. Long polyunsaturated lipids showed highest heritability and genetic sharing, suggesting considerable genetic regulation at fatty acids levels. The observed low genetic sharing between traditional lipids and lipid speciessuggested that routine lipid screens may fail to capture potential disease risk factors. GWAS identi ï¬ed 35 lipid species associated loci (P < 5x10 â8), with 15 new lipid loci and 37 new SNP lipid species pair associations e.g. asso ciation between ABCG5/8 and CE(20:2;0). We show that LPL (lipoprotein lipase) may have more ef ï¬cient hydrolysis of medium length TAGs (triacylglycerides) than other TAGs. The association patterns of SYNGR1, MIR100HG , andPTPRN2 suggested their probable roles in desaturation and/or elongation of fatty acids. PheWAS revealed that 7 of 35 lipid species associated loci also associate with CVD related outcomes, including ABCG5/8 ,APOA1 ,BLK, FADS2 ,LPL, and two new loci COL5A1 and GALNT16 (false discovery rate <0.05). Conclusion: We demonstrate that lipidomics enable deeper insights to the genetic regulation of lipid metabolismthan clinically used lipid measures, which in turn might help guide future disease biomarker discovery.

Materials and Methods: Here we propose a maximum likelihood method to estimate the contribution of GxE tocomplex traits taking into account all interacting environ mental variables at the same time, without the need to measure any. This is possible because GxE induces ï¬uc tuations in the conditional trait variability, the extent of which depends on the strength of GxE. The approach can be1112applied to continuous outcomes and for single SNPs or genetic risk scores (GRS). Results: Extensive simulations covering a wide range of scenarios demonstrated that our method yields unbiased interaction estimates. We also offer a strategy to distinguish speciï¬c GxE from general heteroscedasticity (scale effects). Applying our method to 32 obesity related traits in the UK Biobank reveals that for body mass index (BMI) the GRSxE explains an additional 1.9% variance on top of the 5.2%GRS contribution. However, this interaction is not speci ï¬c to the BMI GRS and holds for any variable equally corre lated with BMI. On the contrary, the GRSxE interactioneffect for leg impedance (0.07) is signi ï¬cantly (P < 10 â56) larger than it would be expected for a similarly correlated variable ( â0.16). Conclusion: We showed that our method could robustly detect the global contribution of GxE to complex traits, which turned out to be substantial for some obesitymeasures. J. Sulc: None. N.

Improved discovery, by further increasing study sizes is not the only strategy. Leveraging published studies of related traits can improveinference. To this end, we developed a Bayesian GWAS approach that builds informative priors from GWASs of related risk factors. Mendelian Randomisation is used toderive multivariate causal effects of a set of iteratively selected risk factors on the target outcome. These causal effects of the risk factors on the outcome are then combinedwith the SNP âs effect on the identi ï¬ed risk factors to build a Bayesian prior for the SNP âs effects on the outcome. We found a set of universally optimal parameters (instrumentstrength, clumping stringency and shrinkage intensity) that maximizes the out of sample squared correlation betweenprior and observed effects (up to ~40%). We use Bayes Factors (BFs) to quantify the evidence in favour of the prior and derived an analytical formula for the null BFs distribution, which led to a 6 fold reduced runtime and a more accurate estimation of P values, compared to permutation based approaches. We are able to gaugegenetic risk score (GRS) performance using only summary statistics from training and test samples. Its application revealed that GRSs based on posterior effects outperformstandard GRS. Applying this technique to human lifespan, we identi ï¬ed 7 new loci ( P< 5e 8), which were missed by standard GWAS.

While neuroimaging can discern millions of morphometric features, genome wideassociation studies have been limited to only a number of aggregate measures due to technical reasons. Methods: We studied 18.000 individuals from 12 cohorts within the CHARGE consortium and UK Biobank partici pants. The structure of the cortical and subcortical grey matter was characterized using voxel based morphometry, atechnique that generates a volume for each of the 1.5 mil lion voxels. Subsequently, genome wide association studies were performed for all these voxels using a newly devel oped software algorithm. The genome wide brain wide signiï¬cance threshold was determined at p ,5Ã1 0 â13. Results: The association analyses between 9 million genetic variants and 1.5 million brain voxels took 17 h to compute, which would require over 2 years using conven tional software. We found 1.270.907 genome wide brain wide signi ï¬cant associations between genetic variants and grey matter voxels, distributed between 55 brain regions with minimum p value ,2Ã1 0 â87. These associations came from 930 variants that mapped to 29 independent loci. Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1113We found 62.920 unique voxels signi ï¬cantly associated at least with one variant. Conclusion: The genome wide interrogation of high resolution neuroimaging data is a powerful approach to identify genetic determinants of brain structure, even at sample sizes considerably smaller than studies of aggregatemeasures. This successful ï¬rst attempt at high throughput GWAS could be extended to various ï¬ne grained (endo) phenotypes, which might prove useful for understanding thegenetic architecture of other complex traits.

However, relatively little of heritability of those traits has been explained by SNPs due to their small effectsizes. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze other types of genetic variations including DNA copy number variations (CNVs). Even though large (>100kbp) rare CNVs are studied for a wide range of complex traits and diseases, detecting shorter CNVs from SNP genotyping array data remains challengingdue to large number of false positives. To address this issue, we have developed a statistical model to predict the quality of possible CNV regions detected by PennCNV software. Our model outperforms the best currently published CNV quality score. Using our CNV quality measure, we conducted genome wide CNV analysis on ten complex diseases (incl. type 2 diabetes, in ï¬ammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), etc.) in up to 398,662 unrelated white Britishindividuals from UK Biobank cohort. In total, we found 18 genome wide signi ï¬cant (P < 1.7*10e 6) CNV disease associations, out of which 15 are novel. Noteworthyexamples are association between RA and a 6p21.3 deletion (P,8.5*10e 7) overlapping a known strong GWAS signal(P,10e 250) and a 10p11.21 deletion associated with IBD (P,9.1*10e 7) that overlaps the tight junction related gene PARD3, which has been associated with IBD in candidate gene studies. Genome wide CNV association studies help us to better understand/ ï¬ne map the underlying genetic mechanisms for complex diseases. Our analyses are a ï¬rst step in compiling a large CNV trait database. M. Lepamets: None. K. Lepik: None. Z. Kutalik: None. R. MÃ¤gi: None.",2019

Methods: We combined genome wide SNP and geo graphic origin data (N ,1422) to explore the interplay between genetics and geography in the Netherlands. Using ChromoPainter/ ï¬neSTRUCTURE we partitioned our data based on patterns of haplotype sharing to identify ï¬ne scale population structure. We analysed patterns of identity by descent (IBD) sharing for segments of different lengths toestimate the time depth of the structure. We investigated whether the structure re ï¬ects barriers to gene ï¬ow using the Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) method. We also analysed spatial clines in haplotype sharing from neighbouring countries using a European reference (N , 4514). Finally, we estimated recent changes in effectivepopulation size using the IBDNe method. Results: We identi ï¬ed 16 genetic clusters which correlate closely with regional geography. At its ï¬nest level, clus tering distinguishes subtly different eastern and western genetic groups in the North Brabant province, while deeper clustering delineates a north south split bisecting thecountry. We estimate that this north south genetic structure is at least 2700 years old, while east west structure is more recent. EEMs revealed a strong migrational cold spotsplitting the country north to south, overlapping the Rhine. Overlaying this deep structure we observe strong opposing northeast southwest spatial clines in German and Belgianhaplotype sharing.

31402,"Understanding the nature of horizontal pleiotropy, where one genetic variant has independent effects on multiple observable traits, is vitally important for our understanding of the genetic architecture of human phenotypes. Manyrecent studies have pointed to the existence of horizontal pleiotropy, but its extent remains unknown, largely due to difï¬culty in disentangling the inherently correlated nature of observable traits. We have developed a statistical frame work to quantify horizontal pleiotropy in human genetic variation, using a two component score computed fromsummary statistics. This score uses a whitening procedure to remove correlations between observable traits and normalize effect sizes across all traits. When applied tosimulated association summary statistics, our score success fully detects horizontal pleiotropy under a range of different models. When applied to 372 heritable phenotypes from theUK Biobank, our pleiotropy score detects a signi ï¬cant excess of horizontal pleiotropy which is pervasive through out the human genome and especially prominent amonghighly polygenic phenotypes. We identify 24,968 variants in 7,831 loci with extreme horizontal pleiotropy, a majority of which have never been reported in any published GWAS. Examining functional annotations, the pleiotropy score is signiï¬cantly higher in active regions and lower in inactive regions. In addition, the pleiotropy score correlates withtranscriptional measures of pleiotropy, it is signi ï¬cantly higher for variants which are eQTLs i) for many genes across many tissues; ii) for genes whose orthologs areassociated with multiple phenotypes in mice or yeast. Our results highlight the central role horizontal pleiotropy plays in the genetic architecture of human phenotypes. M. Verbanck: None. D. M. Jordan: None. R. Do: B.

Here we describe the neurodevelopmental phenotype that resultsfrom disruption of KMT2E in 38 affected individuals from 36 families. From the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), KMT2E is a candidate haploinsuf ï¬cient gene with a LOEUF score of 0.06. This case series includes 28 protein truncating variants (PTVs), four missense variants, and four large deletions encompassing KMT2E , most of which were con ï¬rmed to be de novo. Most affected individuals with protein truncating variants presented with mild intellectual disability, autism and/or epilepsy. Epilepsymore common in females and autism more common in males; many had relative macrocephaly and hypotonia. There appears to be a subtle facial gestalt characterized bydolichocephaly, deep set eyes with down slanting palpebral ï¬ssures, and infraorbital creases. Individuals with micro deletions encompassing KMT2E showed a greater degree of developmental delay. Individuals with missense variants in KMT2E presented with the most severe developmental delays and treatment resistant infantile epileptic encephalo pathy; microcephaly was common in this group. Haploin sufï¬ciency versus gain of function or dominant negative effects speci ï¬c to these missense variants in KMT2E may explain this divergence in phenotype but requires indepen dent validation.

Methods: Through an international collaboration we collected molecular and clinical data from 31 individualswith pathogenic variants in CTCF . We performed tran scriptome analysis on RNA extracted from patient blood samples and utilized Drosophila melanogaster to investi gate the impact of Ctcf dosage alteration on nervous system development and function. Results: The variants identi ï¬ed in CTCF included two large deletions, seven truncating, two splice site and 16 different missense variants, one of them in a mosaic state. One case was familial. The associated phenotype was veryvariable and ranged from mild developmental delay and normal IQ to severe intellectual disability. Feeding dif ï¬ culties, failure to thrive (67%) and behavioral (76%) andvision anomalies (57%) were common. Variable other fea tures included microcephaly (38%), short stature (21%), and cardiac defects (29%). RNA Seq in ï¬ve individuals identi ï¬ed 3,828 deregulated genes enriched for known NDD genes and biological processes such as transcriptional reg ulation. Ctcf knockdown and overexpression in Drosophila showed unaltered morphology of neuromuscular synapses and multiple dendrite neurons but resulted in impaired gross neurological functioning in the climbing assay and learningand memory de ï¬cits in the courtship conditioning paradigm. Conclusion: We broaden the mutational and clinical spectrum of CTCF associated NDDs and gain insights into the functional role of CTCF by identifying deregulated genes and showing that Ctcf dosage alterations result in nervous system defects in Drosophila , modeling important aspects of the human condition.

Here, wereport the identi ï¬cation and phenotypic characterization of nineteen individuals with heterozygous disruptions ofPOU3F3 , most of which are de novo variants. All individuals had developmental delays and/or intellectual disability. Impairments in speech and language skills were common, along with characteristic prominent and cupped ears. POU3F3 is an intronless gene, insensitive to nonsense mediated decay, and thirteen individuals carriedvariants that were predicted to yield a truncated protein. All truncating variants that we tested in cellular models led to aberrant subcellular localization of the encoded protein. Luciferase assays demonstrated negative effects of these alleles on transcriptional activation of a reporter with a FOXP2 derived binding motif, also bound by POU3F2. In addition to the loss of function variants, ï¬ve individuals had missense variants that clustered at speci ï¬c positions within the functional domains, and one small in frame deletion was identi ï¬ed. Some missense variants showed reduced transactivation capacity in our assays, and one variant displayed gain of function effects, suggesting adistinct pathophysiological mechanism. In Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) interaction assays, all the truncated versions of POU3F3 that we tested hadsigniï¬cantly impaired dimerization capacities, while all missense variants showed unaffected dimerization with wild type POU3F3. Taken together, our identi ï¬cation and functional cell based analyses of pathogenic variants in POU3F3 , coupled with in depth clinical characterization, implicate disruptions of this gene in a potentially recogniz able neurodevelopmental disorder.

Therefore, MAPK8IP3 was an appealing candidate gene for further investigation after theinitial identi ï¬cation of a de novo missense variant in an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Through international collaboration and exome sequencing in acohort that sums up to 27232 affected individuals, we identi ï¬ed heterozygous de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 inthirteen unrelated individuals with an overlapping pheno type of mild to severe intellectual disability and variable brain anomalies such as perisylvian polymicrogyria, cerebral or cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. De novo variants comprise six missense variants, three of which are recurrent, and three truncating variants. Brain anomalies were consistent among individuals harbor ing recurrent de novo missense variants, indicating possible variant speci ï¬c phenotypic effects. We provide several lines of evidence for causation through (1) the signi ï¬cant enrichment of de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 within our cohort, (2) structural modelling of variants that lie in known(template) structures and (3) through using the CRISPR Cas9 system to target six conserved amino acid positions in Caenorhabditis elegans to demonstrate increased axonallysosomal density for two and an adverse locomotion phenotype for ï¬ve of the six investigated human variants in this model. Taken together, we ï¬rmly establish hetero zygous de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 as a novel cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability and variable brain anomalies. K.

At the core of the complex machinery that achieves this task are three members of theB family of DNA polymerases; DNA polymerase Î±,Î´and Îµ. Collectively these multimeric polymerases ensure DNA replication proceeds at optimal rates approaching 2x10 3 nucleotides/min, and with an error rate of less than one per million nucleotides polymerised. The majority of DNA replication of undamaged DNA is conducted by DNApolymerases Î´andÎµ. DNA polymerase Î± primase complex performs limited synthesis to initiate the replication process, along with Okazaki fragment synthesis on the discontinuouslagging strand. An increasing number of human disorders caused by defects in different components of the DNA replication apparatus have been described to date. These areclinically diverse, involving a wide range of features including variable combinations of growth delay, immuno deï¬ciency, endocrine insuf ï¬ciencies, lipodystrophy and cancer predisposition. Here, using various complementary approaches including classical linkage analysis, targeted next generating sequencing and whole exome sequencing,we describe distinct missense and splice impacting muta tions in POLA1 inï¬ve unrelated families presenting with an X linked syndrome involving intellectual disability, propor tionate short stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism. POLA1 encodes the p180 catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase Î± primase. A range of replicative impairments could be demonstrated in patient derived lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our ï¬ndings describe the presentation of pathogenic mutations in a catalytic component of a Bfamily DNA polymerase member; DNA polymerase Î±. H. Van Esch: None. R. Colnaghi: None. K. Freson: None.

(Val344AlafsTer71), removing 10 â13 of the 22 exons. The non mosaic SHANK3 deletion carrier mother is in regular work without learning dif ï¬culties or other problems. To explore how the mother can be non penetrant, we collected blood and ï¬broblast cells from all family members for epigenetic , RNA and protein studies. In ï¬broblasts, deep sequencing based mRNA quanti ï¬cation indicated that the mother had a 3.5 fold higher SHANK3 mRNA expres sion from the normal allele than her sons, possibly related to an enhancer triplication 17.5 kb upstream only detected in the mother. This enhancer triplication has a populationprevalence of 20% (561/2771). A more pronounced dif ference was found for the terminal SHANK3 exons 17 â22 also included in two terminal isoforms (isoE/Promoter5 andisoF/Promoter6) located downstream of the deletion. To investigate the epigenetic status of the CpG islands related to the SHANK3 promoters P1 P6, we performed methylation sensitive amplicon based deep sequencing of DNA puri ï¬ed from blood and ï¬broblasts after bisulphite treatment. The putative isoF promoter (core Promoter6 w/nine CpGs) was hypomethylated ( x Ì,1.5 Â± 0.94%) in ï¬broblast DNA from all deletion carriers compared to control subjects ( x Ì,15.5 Â± 0.74%). In conclusion, non penetrance of an early SHANK3 deletion in a carrier mother is associated with i)higher SHANK3 expression from her normal allele, possibly rela ted to a common enhancer triplication only in the mother, and ii)increased expression of C terminal SHANK3 iso forms from both alleles.

We performed detailed metabolic pro ï¬ling of a large randomised statin trial and compared the results with the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9, acting as a naturally occurring trial. Materials and Methods: Altogether 228 circulating metabolic measures were quanti ï¬ed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including lipoprotein subclass concentrations and their lipid composition, fatty acids, andamino acids, for 5,359 individuals in the PROSPER trial. The corresponding metabolic measures were analysed in eight cohorts (N ,72,185) using PCSK9 rs11591147 to mimic the therapeutic effects of PCSK9 inhibitors. Results: Scaled to an equivalent lowering of LDL C, the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9 on 228 metabolicmarkers were generally consistent with those of statin therapy ( R 2,0.88). However, discrepancies were observed for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipid measures. For instance, genetic inhibition of PCSK9 had weaker effects on lowering of VLDL cholesterol compared with statin therapy (54 vs. 77% reduction, relative to the low ering effect on LDL C). Genetic inhibition of PCSK9 showed no signi ï¬cant effects on amino acids, ketones, or a marker of in ï¬ammation, whereas statin treat ment weakly lowered GlycA levels. Conclusion: Genetic inhibition of PCSK9 had similar metabolic effects as statin therapy on detailed lipid andmetabolite pro ï¬les. However, PCSK9 inhibitors are pre dicted to have weaker effects on VLDL lipids compared with statins for an equivalent lowering of LDL C, whichpotentially translate into smaller reductions in cardiovas cular disease risk.

While the human genome is set at birth, the gut microbiome can undergo dynamic changesover the course of an individual âs life. However, we still know little about temporal shifts in the human gut microbiome, nor about the causes and consequences oftemporal shifts. We performed a longitudinal analysis on the gut microbiome of 341 participants in the Dutch population based cohort Lifelines DEEP, each individualhaving metagenomics and deep phenotypic data at two time points (~5 years apart). Signi ï¬cant temporal changes in the gut microbiome were detected at the levels of microbialcomposition, function and antibiotic resistance. Abundance difference was observed for 40% of taxonomies, 60% of functional pathways and 40% of antibiotic resistance genes. Furthermore, genetic stability analysis at strain level has revealed several species are under high evolution rate, including gastrointestinal disease associated Ruminococcus torques . Notable, temporal changes were associated to individual phenotypic variation and lifestyle factors. For instance, the genetic variation in Coprococcus sp ART55/ 1strains was higher in individuals with larger changes in BMI, while Streptococcus thermophilus and Biï¬dobacter ium longum showed higher mutation rates in proton pump inhibitor and non steroidal anti in ï¬ammatory users, as compared to non users. Our data show that the gut microbiome sees dynamic changes not only in microbialcomposition and functional pro ï¬les but also in microbial genetic variation and antibiotic resistance. Our ï¬ndings yield novel insights into the gut microbiome âs impact on the development of complex diseases and traits over time. L. Chen: None. S. Garmaeva: None. A. Kurilshikov: None. R.

However, phase IIIrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, suggest an imbalance of serious cardiovascular events. Methods: We used two independent variants in SOST (encoding sclerostin) associated with bone mineral density (BMD) as proxies for therapeutic inhibition of sclerostin. We estimated the effects on risk of osteoporosis, fracture, coronary heart disease (CHD) and a further 22 cardiome tabolic traits, by combining data from 478,967 participantsfrom three cohorts and up to 1,030,836 participants from nine GWAS consortia. In addition, we performed meta analysis of cardiovascular outcomes from RCTs ofromosozumab. Results: RCT meta analysis identi ï¬ed a higher risk of cardiac ischaemic events in patients randomised to romo sozumab (25 events among 4,298 individuals; odds ratio [OR] 2.98; 95% con ï¬dence interval [CI], 1.18 â7.55; P , 0.017). Scaled to the equivalent dose of romosozumab(210mg/month; 0.09 g/cm 2higher BMD), the SOST var iants associated with lower risk of fracture (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.54 â0.66; P ,1.4 Ã 10â24), and osteoporosis (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36 â0.52; P ,2.4 Ã 10â18). The SOST var iants associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularisation (69,649 cases; OR, 1.18;95% CI, 1.06 â1.32; P ,0.003) and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05 â1.27; P ,0.003), higher systolic blood pressure (1.3mmHg; 95% CI 0.8 â1.9; P,5.9 Ã 10 â6) and waist to hip ratio adjusted for BMI (0.05 SDs; 95% CI, 0.02â0.08; P ,8.5 Ã 10â4).Conclusion: Genetically and therapeutically lowered sclerostin leads to higher risk of cardiovascular events.

However, responses are very heterogeneous and we lack predictive biomarkers. Anti angiogenic therapies are key ï¬rst line drugs in mRCC. Our objective was to identify mutations associated with angiogenesis inhibitors response that could help personalizing mRCC treatment. Material and Methods: Samples were collected through an observational study from the Spanish Oncology Geni tourinary Group and Leuven Hospital. Whole exomesequencing (WES) was performed on tumor and blood from 28 mRCC patients with extreme response to ï¬rst line sunitinib. 45 genes were sequenced on 156 additional tumorcases. Patients were classi ï¬ed as anti angiogenic drug responders (PFS>18 months), non responders (PFS < 6 months) or intermediate responders (remaining patients).AKDM5C knockout (KO) model in 786 O cells was gen erated using CRISPR/Cas9 and characterized by proteomics (iTRAQ technology). Results: WES revealed that mutations in KDM5C , encoding a chromatin remodeling protein, were over represented among responder patients, and full series ana lysis con ï¬rmed the association (OR ,0.23; 95%CI , 0.07â0.77; P ,0.017). Proteomic analysis in the KDM5CAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1121cellular model revealed 414 proteins differentially expres sed (FC ,0.3/3.3; P ,0.01). The proangiogenic proteins SPHK2, SRC and RHOC were overexpressed (P < 0.01) in the KO cells suggesting that mutated tumors are more dependent on angiogenesis. Conclusion: Mutations in KDM5C are associated with improved response to anti angiogenic treatment in mRCC, potentially due to an overexpression of proangiogenic pro teins.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ï¬c diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels.

The two affected children exhibited very low blood taurine levels (6 and 7Âµmol/l),heterozygous parents had intermediate levels (24 and 34Âµmol/l), and an unaffected non carrier sibling had normal levels (71Âµmol/l) (normal values:37 â127Âµmol/l). In vitro experiments showed a reduced K Mand V MAX for taurine uptake by HEK 293 cells expressing the mutant (Gly399 Val) SLC6A6 providing only 11 â18% of transport compared to wild type SLC6A6. Similar results were obtained with ï¬broblasts derived from affected individuals. Clinical evaluation showed that the affected boy hascomplete visual loss, while the affected girl retained some visual acuity. In addition, both affected siblings have mild hypokinetic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction. Slc6a6 knockout in a previously reported mouse model causes progressive retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy and very low taurine levels in blood and other tissues. Following ethics approval from the Swiss authorities we have initiated a taurine supplementation to both affected individuals. Clinical examinations performed after one yearof taurine supplementation (100mg/kg/day, in 3 doses) showed normal taurine levels in blood and no progression of retinal degeneration in the affected girl. We conclude that the supplementation of taurine could stop the progressive visual loss caused by hypomorphic functional defect in the SLC6A6 transporter in humans. E. Ranza: None. M. Ansar: None. M.

Albert2 1University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, 2Women âs Health Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, CanadaIntroduction: In the context of serious mental illness (SMIs, i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaf fective disorder) medication non adherence is an important and complex problem, for which no effective gold standard solution exists. Beliefs about illness etiology in ï¬uence behaviours like medication adherence, thus genetic coun seling (GC), which helps people understand illness etiology and how it relates to recommended treatments couldplausibly in ï¬uence medication adherence. Materials and Methods: We recruited 110 people with SMI to a study designed to test the hypothesis that GCwould increase adherence to psychotropic medications. Participants completed the Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS) twice (1month apart) before receiving GC (T1:baseline and T2: immediately pre GC) and twice after GC (T3 and T4, 1 and 2 months post GC respectively). We used mixed effects logistic regression and validated criteria tomodel BARS scores as a binary variable (adherent ,Y/N) over the 4 time points, and accounted for repeated measures. Results: Using 392 observations from 108 participants (schizophrenia n ,23, schizoaffective n ,14, bipolar n , 71), there was a signi ï¬cant relationship between the prob ability of adherence and timepoint (p ,0.031). Post hoc pairwise comparisons with holm corrected p values indi cated the probability of adherence was higher at T4 (86%)compared to T2 (78%) (p ,0.04, OR ,7.08 (95% CI 1.73 to 28.99)). Conclusion: Our data suggest that GC can improve adherence to psychotropic medications in individuals with SMI and that the effect size is large. Further work on the impact of GC on medication adherence, as well as mentalhealth and economic outcomes is warranted. Supported by Pï¬zer Canada. J. Austin: B.

Psychiatric genetic counselling (PGC) is not routinely offered, with a few exceptions. In order to address patients and profes sionals interests and needs, we designed and implemented a training course aimed at equipping them with theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The impact of the coursewas assessed. Method: Data was collected from ï¬ve free training courses involving 125 professionals from 18 countries,between 2015 and 2019. Responses were anonymised. Questionnaires assessing participants knowledge and self efï¬cacy were ï¬lled out before and after the training. Results: There was a signi ï¬cant increase in both knowledge [t(124) ,2.05, p < .004)] and self ef ï¬cacy [t (124),27.1, p < 001] following the course, suggesting participants not only gained knowledge and skills during the course but also felt more empowered to offer PGC after the course. Conclusion: Adapting existing services or designing new ones will take time, requiring further empirical evidence to show the impact and implications of PGC training. Estab lishing practice recommendation and standardised training guidelines that include a good understanding of psychiatric disorders and genomics, a pro ï¬cient mastery of counselling skills and ethical standards is clearly timely and essential in order to ensure quality of future PGC services.

To improve access and decrease wait times, we are trialing large scale group genetic counselling in a publicly funded population basedhealth care setting. Methods: This initiative compares pre test group genetic counselling sessions (up to 50 patients per group) to tradi tional one on one genetic counselling. A secondary objec tive is to trial genetic testing in unaffected individuals. Patients are provided the option of either the large grouparm or the traditional arm with the aim to enroll 400 patients in total. All patients receive a post test one on one results session. Eligibility includes unaffected adult individualswith a family history meeting clinical testing criteria. Patients are invited to complete the Genetic Counselling Outcome Scale, a satisfaction survey and the Multi dimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment. Results: To date, 344 patients (176 group; 168 one on one) have been enrolled in the trial. Of the 174 patients whohave completed testing, 15 (8.6%) have had a pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variant identi ï¬ed, most commonly in BRCA1 /BRCA2 . Both the large group arm and traditional one on one arm have shown high patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Emerging data shows that a large scale group genetic counselling model is feasible, effective andacceptable to patients; this model may be included in a multi pronged approach to deliver quality hereditary cancer care while balancing the needs of the patient, the provider,and the public medical system.

The company opened the website arfgerd.is, on May 15th 2018 where research participants can query their genotype regarding the Icelandic pathogenic founder variant (PV) BRCA2 : c.771_775del5. Positive individuals are advised to contact the genetic counselling unit (GC) at Landspitali NationalUniversity Hospital for con ï¬rmatory testing and further advise. We report the experience of the GC up to the end of 2018. At the time, 44.300 individuals had signed onto the website. A total of 340 (average age 44 years), had received positive results. We estimate that at least 40 of the 340 had receivedtheir results and genetic counselling earlier. A total of 175 of the 300 remaining had contacted the GC unit by 31.12.2018. The remaining 125 (40%) had not but thereason is not clear. Additionally, 118 relatives contacted the GC unit. Of the BRCA2 positive (n ,175), (66) 37% knew about the PV in the family while 95 (54%) did not. Mostwere grateful for the knowledge. Surprised about the results were 46 (24%), and not 61 (29%). Worried, scared, upset or had dif ï¬culties coping with the positive results were 49 (29%), and 13% not.

As the capacity to meet the increased demand for personalized counselling is limited, we need new information andcommunication tools for this purpose. Aim: Design and implement chatbot technology as an easy, reliable and safe communication tool to supportindividuals undergoing genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. Materials and methods: We are developing and imple menting a new app that can perform chat conversations about genetic testing with patients, using so called Chatbot technology, based on arti ï¬cial intelligence. User experi ences related to trust and usefulness of the Chatbot is central to the study, and will be evaluated through usability testing and focus group interviews. Results from the ï¬rst pilot test will be presented. Discussion: The use of Chatbots in health care is emer ging, thus the project is expected to be timely. We expectthat this BRCA Chatbot will serve as an important proof of principle concept and public innovation process, to sup plement and improve traditional genetic counselling. TheBRCA Chatbot may personalize counselling and put the patients in a proactive role in their search for information. We anticipate that the patients using the BRCA Chatbotwill be better prepared for face to face consultations in the hospital, and that the tool will be a useful and trusted aid in mastering their lives after these consultations.

Though patients understand the importance of sharing information, espe cially for those with risks of preventable and treatable diseases, many relatives do not receive this in a timely fashion. Interventions which make it clear for patients whom to inform, how to inform, and what information toconvey, are urgently needed. Methods: We employed a Person Based Approach to ensure the intervention was grounded in the experiences andneeds of patients attending a genomic medicine service. This involved: a meta synthesis of previous interventions; synthesizing communication barriers/facilitators; inter viewing 27 participants from the UK âs 100,000 Genomes Project; and Systems Thinking to map in ï¬uences on the target behaviour. Results: We identi ï¬ed several interventions to aid family communication of genetic results, though most were of poor quality, ineffective, and lacked theoretical underpinning. Interview data showed that (a) many participants had not told many or any relatives they were undergoing genomic testing, and (b) that they would like help to communicatetheir results to relatives. These results, along with barriers, facilitators, and in ï¬uences, were used to create the inter vention content. Conclusion: myKinMatters could provide a useful addi tional tool for clinicians to direct patients towards. As genomic medicine becomes ever more widely available, wehope such online interventions will facilitate at least some communication with relatives that otherwise might not happen. Relatives can then make informed decisions abouttheir own testing, surveillance, or preventative options. Future research involves piloting the intervention. Fellow ship: Health Education England L.

WestersUniversity Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Introduction: In cancer genome diagnostics analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel data is focused on the subset of genes with a proven associationto the phenotype that prompted referral. In this study we investigated which pathogenic variants are detected as secondary ï¬ndings when genes proven to be associated with other familial cancer types were analyzed as well. Materials and Methods: We have analyzed NGS panel data of 2,090 patients referred for genome diagnostics forfamilial cancer. We analyzed SNVs, Indels and CNVs in all 73 or 85 genes from the targeted panel for all patients, regardless of the cancer type prompting referral. Also wescreened 1,326 people from the general Dutch population for pathogenic variants in the 85 cancer genes of our targeted panel. Results: In 10.2% of patients we detected a variant matching their families âcancer phenotype. We detected secondary ï¬ndings in 3.9% of patients. In the general population 3.2% of individuals carried a pathogenic variant in one of the panel genes. Limiting secondary ï¬ndings to the genes listed by the EGAPP, ACMG and SFMPPsocieties as targets for screening and reporting 0.3, 0.7 and 1.4% actionable secondary ï¬ndings would have been reported, respectively in patients. For the general populationthese numbers are 0.1, 0.4 and 1.5%. Conclusion: Over 1 in 30 persons in the Dutch popula tion carries a pathogenic variant in a cancer predisposinggene. This ï¬nding gives an estimate on what to expect if screening for those genes would be offered as extension of diagnostic testing. L. F. Johansson: None. K. K. van Dijk Bos: None. A.

Carriers of Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic P/LP var iants undergo intensive screening and/or risk reduction gastrectomy/mastectomy. Herein, we explored the pheno typic landscape of a European cohort of CDH1 mutation carriers to demonstrate the value of genetic testing driven by phenotype and clinical criteria. We collected and curated variant classi ï¬cation, clinical criteria and phenotypes from 700 European CDH1 muta tion carriers of 10 European Countries belonging to ERN GENTURIS. We excluded those presenting 3 â² UTR, 5 â² UTR, intronic variants outside splicing regions and unclassi ï¬able to date. We focused on 389 probands bearing 214 different CDH1 variants. In our cohort, 137 families ful ï¬lled HDGC, 31 had bor derline HDGC criteria, 221 lacked clinical criteria. While 85% of HDGC/borderline HDGC cases carried large rearrangements or truncating variants, 90% of those lack ing criteria carried missense mutations. Based on ACMG classi ï¬cation, 155 families carried P/LP actionable variants: 76% HDGC; 15% borderline HDGC, and 10% lacking criteria. Large rearrangements occurred in 20% of HDGC/ borderline HDGC families. Families bearing rearrange ments either presented DGC only or LBC only, while families bearing point mutations more often displayed DGC only. The most common CDH1 germline mutation in Eur ope is Del_Ex1 2 found in 18 families from 6 different countries. Twenty P/LP variants are recurrent in 90 families across Europe. This is the ï¬rst family driven analysis performed in a curated cohort of CDH1 mutation carriers.

We explored whether a genetic test that incorporates a 313 SNP basedPolygenic Risk Score (PRS) is clinically meaningful in non BRCA1/2 Dutch breast cancer families. Materials and Methods : We included 2186 breast cancer cases from 1907 Dutch non BRCA1/2 breast cancer famil ies. The 313 SNP PRS was calculated and standardised to 3479 Dutch population controls (sPRS). The association ofthe sPRS with breast cancer was estimated using a logistic regression model, adjusted for family history. Standard errors were corrected to account for relatedness of indivi duals. Using the recently extended BOADICEA model, with and without individual PRS, lifetime risks wereretrospectively calculated by simulating an individual to be at an age of one year and unaffected (for cases), i.e., lifetime risk at birth, given the family history. Results : The mean sPRS for breast cancer cases was 0.65 (SD,0.88, 95%CI ,[0.62 â0.69]). We found a signi ï¬cant association between sPRS and breast cancer, OR ,1.70, 95%CI[1.67 â1.72], p value < 2e 16. Including the sPRS to BOADICEA family based risk prediction would have changed screening recommendations in 26, 33, and 36% ofthe cases according to breast cancer screening guidelines from the USA, United Kingdom and the Netherlands (NCCN, NICE, and IKNL), respectively. For the populationcontrols, lacking family data, this was 5, 12 and 5% respectively. Conclusion : Our results con ï¬rm the association between breast cancer and the 313 SNP PRS in the Dutch population and support the application of the PRS in risk prediction for genetically unexplained breast cancer families.

Leveraging up to 23 years of prospective data from the population based FINRISK study (n ,21,951), we built genome wide PRSs with >6 million variants forcoronary heart disease (CHD), atrial ï¬brillation (AF), type 2 diabetes (T2D), breast cancer, and prostate cancer and tested their 1) associations with incident cases, 2) impact onage at disease onset, and 3) impact in prediction alongside established clinical risk factors.1128A high PRS (>97.5thpercentile) was strongly associated with higher disease incidence (hazard ratios 3.73 â38.29 for top vs bottom 2.5%, p values 0.0003 â6.65x10â22). This risk increase translated into earlier disease onset by 9 to 29 years in the high risk group. For example, for T2D the age at onset in the high risk group was 29.0 years earlier than inthe low risk group. Of 297 early onset CHD (age <55) cases, the clinical ASCVD risk calculator for cardiovascular diseases identi ï¬ed only 13.1% as high risk ( â¥7.5%); high (>80 thpercen tile) CHD PRS was the only risk factor in 31.0% and a familial hypercholesterolemia mutation was present in0.3%. Excluding age as a risk factor, the PRS had a higher effect for CHD risk than did the routinely measured clinical risk factors combined, with similar ï¬ndings for AF and T2D.

Data are limited regarding prevalence and penetrance of ârareâactionable genetic conditions in the unselected (âhealthy â) population. We aim to quantify the prevalence of clinically actionable variants in a healthy Canadian population. Methods: Since September 2017, patients of Medcan, a preventive wellness clinic in Toronto, may opt in (self pay) to Invitae âs proactive screening panel of 130 +genes, with pre and post test genetic counselling. Gene list is derivedfrom ACMG59 recommendations with additional clinically actionable genes, primarily hereditary cancer and cardiac predispositions. Those positive for pathogenic or likelypathogenic variants are referred for additional screening and management per existing clinical guidelines. Results: Data collection is ongoing, anticipating 1700 + patients by June 2019. Data from our ï¬rst 1300 patients reveal a positive rate of 14.2%, excluding carriers ofrecessive conditions. Removing biallelic hemochromatosis variants, the positive rate is 9.8%. Limiting to those reportable per ACMG59 criteria (i.e. excluding MUTYH heterozygotes, APC I1307K carriers, and variants in non ACMG59 genes, like CHEK2 andPALB2 ), positive rate is 3.7%. Of all positives, only 5.5% would have quali ï¬ed for publicly funded genetic testing. Conclusion: A substantial rate of clinically actionable genetic ï¬ndings is seen in a âhealthy âCanadian population who would not otherwise access genetic testing. Long itudinal data are needed to determine whether proactive genomic screening leads to improved health outcomes, andwhether the cost bene ï¬t balance warrants consideration of population screening within the public healthcare system.

Some single payer or state funded healthcare systems are already considering offering population genomic testing to allAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1129members. Yet the necessary cost effectiveness analysis of population screening for multiple genetic conditions con currently has been lacking. Aim: To forecast the combined impact and cost effectiveness of offering population genomic screening to all young adults in a single payer healthcare system. Methods: We modelled screening of 2,688,192 indivi duals, all adults aged 18 â25yo in Australia, for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/BRCA2/MLH1/MSH2 genes, and con current preconception carrier screening for cystic ï¬brosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X syn drome (FXS), at 71% testing uptake, using per test costsranging AUD$200 $1,200 (~ â¬125 $760). Investment costs included genetic counseling, surveillance and interventions (reimbursed only) for at risk individuals/couples. Cost effectiveness was de ï¬ned below AUD$50,000/DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Year) prevented, using an incre mental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), compared with tar geted testing. Outcomes were cancer incidence/mortality, disease cases, and treatment costs reduced. Results: Population screening would reduce mutation attributable cancers by 28Â·8%, cancer deaths by 31Â·2%, and CF/SMA/FXS cases by 24Â·8%, compared with targeted testing. Assuming AUD$400 per test (~ â¬250), investment would be between 4 â5 times higher than current expendi ture. However, screening would lead to substantial savings in medical costs and DALYs prevented, at a highly cost effective ICER (AUD$4,038/DALY). At AUD$200 per test, screening would approach cost saving for the health system (ICER ,AUD$22/DALY).

Pearson Correlation analysis was employed to identify mRNAs that are strongly correlated with lncRNAs. These lncRNAs and their corre lated mRNAs were then evaluated for association with clinical phenotypes (e.g. tumor grade). lncRNA mRNA co expression network analyses was then performed to identifyoncogenic or tumor suppressive Potential Master lncRNA regulator(s) (PMR) which is signi ï¬cantly correlated with the most mRNAs which share similar clinical phenotype asthe PMR. Results: We identi ï¬ed a total of 37 co expression net works with 453 clinically associated lncRNA mRNA pairs. A notable network comprises 5 upregulated PMR lncRNAs with 91 correlated genes which are signi ï¬cantly associated with tumor grade. Genes in this network are enriched incell cycle function. Another signi ï¬cant network comprises 2 downregulated lncRNAs signi ï¬cantly correlated with 8 mainly metallothionein protein family genes and are sig niï¬cantly associated with tumor invasion. Conclusion: These PMR lncRNAs thus have potential to serve as actionable targets for therapeutic intervention. C. G. Lee: None. L. J. Lim: None. J. Yu: None. H. C. Toh: None. P. K.H. Chow: None. A.

DICER1 is the only known miRNAbiogenesis component associated with an inherited tumor syndrome, which features multinodular goiter (MNG) and rare pediatric onset lesions, including Wilms tumor (WT).Whole exome sequencing in six affected and three non affected individuals from a kindred with early onset MNG identi ï¬ed a germline missense variant in DGCR8 , c.1552G>A;p.

The variant has never been described in the germline, it is a recurrent somatic mutation in WT and has been reported in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).We performed a genome wide screen for copy number alterations in the schwannomas, MNG, DTC, Wilms tumor and CPP tumors heterozygous for p.

E Cadherin loss of func tion (LoF) correlates with metastatic spread in most epithelial cancers (somatic), early onset gastric and breast cancer (germline EOGC/EOBC) and cleft lip/palate, how ever the underlying mechanisms are vastly unknown. CDH1 70Kb intron 2 full deletion was shown to induce E cadherin LoF, therefore we hypothesized that structuralvariation at CDH1 intronic CREs could further explain CDH1 associated disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: Bioinformatics analysis of genomic/epigenomic regulatory features revealed several CDH1 CREs, which were sequenced in the germline of EOGC/EOBC patients ( n,250). Using CRISPR/Cas9, selected CREs were edited, genotyped and characterized for CDH1 /E cadherin expression in GC cell lines using qRT PCR, allele speci ï¬c expression assay, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. CREs enhancer activity was asses sed in zebra ï¬sh embryos. Results : All CREs harbored novel SNVs and/or CNVs in EOGC/EOBC patients. Homozygous editing of two CREs led to CDH1 RNA and protein expression loss in GC cells. CDH1 LoF was caused by inversions and/or deletions affecting CRE sequences. In vivo, both CREs displayed tissue speci ï¬c enhancer activity, particularly in the mouth and/or midline of Zebra ï¬sh embryos, areas where CDH1 plays a crucial role during development. Conclusion: With our combined dry/wet lab approaches, we narrowed down regions within CDH1 intronic regions able to control CDH1 /E Cadherin expression and function. We further unveiled that both deletions and inversions ofAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1131CREs may lead to E cadherin LoF, suggesting novel mechanisms worth screening in CDH1 associated disease phenotypes.

However, a fraction of such variants could maintain function through their impact on RNA splicing. To test this hypothesis, we used the alternatively spliced BRCA2 exon 12 (E12) as a model, since its in frame skipping leads to a potentially functional protein. All BRCA2 E12 variants corresponding to putative null variants or predicted to alter splicing (n ,39) were selected from databases and characterized for their impact on splicing in minigeneassays and in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines, when available. Moreover, a selection of variants was analyzed in mouse embryonic stem cell based functional assays. Usingthese complementary approaches, we demonstrate that a subset of variants, including nonsense variants, (i) induces in frame E12 skipping through the modi ï¬cation of splice sites or regulatory elements and, as a consequence, (ii) leads to the production of an internally deleted but partially functional protein. These data provide evidence for the ï¬rst time in a cancer predisposition gene that variant induced perturbation of splicing can, at least partially, rescue the loss of function of certain presumed null variants. Additionalstudies are required to estimate cancer risk associated with these hypomorphic variants. The existence of such rescue mechanism may question the pathogenic classi ï¬cation of certain null variants identi ï¬ed in disease causing genes. Our ï¬ndings emphasize the importance of RNA based analyses and assessment of protein function to ensure accuratevariant classi ï¬cation, a paramount step in genomic medicine. L. Meulemans: None.

Genetic factors and pathways underlying cervical cancer are largely unknown. We performed a genome wide association study to unravellow risk cervical cancer susceptibility variants in the German population. A series of 375 patients with invasive cervical cancer and 866 healthy controls were directlygenotyped for ~570,000 variants on the Illumina OncoArray BeadChip. After genotype calling, QC, PCA, and imputa tion, we used PLINK to analyze 21,326,396 variants fortheir association with cervical cancer. We did not identify single variants at the level of genome wide signi ï¬cance. However, a gene based analysis using MAGMA throughmapping SNPs to 19,213 protein coding genes indicated a signiï¬cant role for OSGIN1 (p,1.12x10E 8) encoding a p53 regulated tumor suppressor. Pathway analyses usingMAGMA detected an enrichment for the GO term âProtein kinases â(p,0.02). To look deeper into possible pathways involved, the SNPs were ï¬ltered more stringently using ANNOVAR positional mapping, eQTL, 3D chromatin interaction mapping and common features of chromatin regulation, and 180 prioritized genes were testedusing GENE2FUNC. We found signi ï¬cant enrichment for genes residing in a breast cancer 12q amplicon (p , 1.9x10E 14) and for genes that had emerged from aprevious GWAS for âResponse to platinum based neoadju vant chemotherapy in cervical cancer â(p,3.6x10E 18).

Balearic Islands Health Investigation Institute (IDISBA) Oncologicas (CNIO), Inca, Spain Type I gastric neuroendocrine tumors (gNETs) arise from hypergastrinemia in patients with autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis. According to the classical model, thegastric H +/K+ATPase was the causative autoantigen recognized by CD4 +T cells in chronic autoimmune scenario that produces the parietal cell atrophy, whichcorrelates with gastric achlorhydria and increases the risk for gNETs and gastric neoplasms. However, the mechanism by which the in ï¬ammatory response correlates with IL 17 secretion and PC atrophy is not clearly de ï¬ned. Recently, we found that the ATP4A p. R703Cmutation impaired PC function and normal gastric acidi ï¬cation, which drove familial gNET. Our group constructed a knock in mouse model for the ATP4A mutation, which at one year recapitulated human premalignant conditions and achlorhydria. We have mon itored the mouse model for one more year and have served us to better understand the relation between impaired capability to export protons across the plasma membraneof PCs and tumor progression. The ATP4A p. R703Cmutation drives gastric achlorhydria, but also deregulates the acid base balance within PCs, affecting mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial malfunction activates ROS signaling, which triggers caspase 3 mediated apoptosis. Therefore, mitochon dria alteration would initiate the chronic in ï¬ammation and does not involve an IL 17 secretion mediated mechanism rather than the classical explanation. In addition, by restoring gastric euchlorhydria, mitochondrial function is recovered. Finally, infection by H. pylori promotes destabilization of the mitochondria of the PCs by a mechanism similar to that described for APT4A p. R703Ccarriers, which suggests that restoring gastric euchlorhydria might be indicated for the treatment of these patients. O. Calvete: None. R. Marra: None. J. Reyes: None. J. Benitez: None.

Current treatments do not address the underlying genetic defect. A suite of Clade F adeno associated viruses was isolated from human periph eral blood CD34 +hematopoietic stem cells (AAVHSCs) and show high hepatic af ï¬nity and potential for gene therapy. Here we describe the ability of AAVHSC mediatedgene therapy to durably correct the disease phenotype in the Pah enu2mouse model of severe PKU. Gene therapy vectors containing a human PAH transgene driven by ubiquitous or liver speci ï¬c promoters packaged in AAVHSC15 were tested in Pahenu2mice. Vectors were administered in a single intravenous dose followed byperiodic assessment of serum phenylalanine and tyrosine (byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism). At study termi nation, livers were processed to measure vector genomes,mRNA and PAH enzyme activity. One week post dose of an initial research vector using an ubiquitous promoter, phenylalanine levels decreased from2000 Î¼M to <150 Î¼M (p < 0.0001) and were sustained out to >28 weeks (p < 0.0001). To enhance long term durability with decreased doses, vector sequences in AAVHSC15 PAH were optimized using different liver speci ï¬c pro moters. We selected a vector, HMI 102, that decreased serum phenylalanine and increased serum tyrosine at ten fold lower doses compared to the initial research vector. A durable response was seen out to 48 weeks, consistent with the model âs lifespan. These data demonstrate that a single dose of HMI 102 resulted in long term correction of PKU inPah enu2mice on protein containing chow. S. S. Ahmed: A.

Currently, no treatment exists. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)provides modest bene ï¬t in pre symptomatic patients but this well short of a realistic treatment. Gene transfer experiments using lenti viral vectors have shown success in decreasingsulfatide accumulation in the CNS of ARSA â/âmouse models; however, this treatment has shown no success in targeting the peripheral nervous system. In the presentstudy, we compared single stranded (ss) AAV serotypes AAV 9 and AAVrh10, packaged with a codon optimized ARSA gene or eGFP. The vectors were delivered via tailvein injection for PNS distribution to ARSA â/âmice at 6 months of age at a dose of 2x1010vector grams per mouse. The gene transfer facilitated both GFP biodistribution (measured via PCR and histopathology) and ARSA bio distribution (measured via HPLC and PCR) along with detectable enzymatic activity throughout the sciaticnerve, spinal cord and liver. Histopathological analysis of the spinal cord and sciatic nerve show presence of GFP indicating positive vector transfection, with AAV 9 show ing the most evident GFP presence. In summary, we demonstrate for the ï¬rst time that tail vein injection of AAV 9 and AAVrh10 to an ARSA / mouse as a treatment strategy for MLD is successfully able to target the PNS and signiï¬cantly decrease sulfatide accumulation in PNS associated tissue which has a direct therapeutic bene ï¬t.

This study demonstrates that correction of the common HBBIVSI 110(G>A)Î² thalassemia splice muta tion may be achieved by ef ï¬cient non homologous end joining mediated disruption of the aberrant regulatory elements (DARE) created by the mutation. Material and Methods: DARE correction was evaluated in patient derived CD34+cells by nucleofection of in vitro synthesized TALEN mRNAs and of CRISPR/Cas9 RNA guided nuclease (RGN) ribonucleoprotein complexes. Correction ef ï¬ciency was assessed as restoration of correct splicing at RNA (RT qPCR), protein (HPLC) and cell morphology (differential counts) levels, and off target activity by targeted deep sequencing. Results: Proof of principle was achieved in patient derived CD34 +cells for both nucleases, reaching high bulk disruption ef ï¬ciencies of up to 90%. Restoration of correct splicing established up to 63 and 77% of normal Î² globin synthesis for TALENs and RGN, respectively. RGN off target activity for the RNF219_AS1 gene was abolished at high on target correc tion, by evaluating strategic mismatches and employing thehigh ï¬delity AltR_HiFi_Cas9. Across primary samples, DARE achieved signi ï¬cant correction of the two hallmarks ofÎ² thalassaemia pathology, Î² globin synthesis and late stage erythroid differentiation. Conclusion: Our study shows that mutation speci ï¬c gene therapy by DARE is highly ef ï¬cient and holds great potential for many human diseases caused by aberrant regulatory motifs.

More than 90% of the cases are caused by a de novo point mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene ( LMNA c.1824 C>T, p. G608G). This mutation activates a cryptic splice sitewithin the LMNA gene and results in a production of a truncated unprocessed lamin A protein called progerin. In this study, we use a conditional humanized mouse modelwith tissue speci ï¬c expression of the common HGPS mutation in keratinocytes of the skin, as well as patient derived cell cultures. For precise single base editing, we areusing a CRISPR Cas9 adenine editor (ABE) in order to reverse the c.1824C>T point mutation by adeno associated virus (AAV) delivery. Cell culture experiments with B cell derived lymphoblastoid cells from a HGPS patient show a signiï¬cant reduction of the c.1824 C>T mutation with a correction ef ï¬ciency up to 76% and a reduction of the c.1824 C>T mutant allele frequency down to 12% by ABE treatment. In ongoing experiments we are assessing the AAV delivery system as well as the ABE ef ï¬ciency in vivo in order to improve the HGPS phenotype. Using this method we have the possibility to target the disease on a genetic level before complex downstream mechanisms aretaking place, with the future aim of a highly precise and efï¬cient gene editing approach for clinical use in HGPS patients.

Lupski Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States Introduction: Complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) are de ï¬ned as structural variants consisting of two or more breakpoint junctions and can contribute to as much as 30% of pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) in genomic disorders. CGRs are hypothesized to result of an error prone mechanism during repair of a single ended, double stranded DNA that utilizes a poorly processive DNA polymeraseresulting in multiple fork collapses and template switching (TS). Majority of CGRs studied show TS within the same chromosome. Objectives: to gain mechanistic insights into the forma tion of CGRs. Material and Methods: we studied six trios on which probands were referred with congenital malformations car rying de novo autosomal CGRs. Trios were studied by combined array comparative genomic hybridization(aCGH), SNP array, targeted 7Mb Illumina short read, PacBio or Nanopore long read sequencing. Results: This combined approach enabled to resolve breakpoint junctions in 6/8 cases. Phasing was obtained by B allele frequency analysis within the CNV provided by the trio joint calling. Surprisingly, in each of the cases here, theampli ï¬ed segments are constituted by a mix of copies from both homologues rather than originated from only one ancestral chromosome. Two informative cases indicatedthat the CGRs were formed pre zygotically, whereas one case was formed post zygotic. Conclusion: CNV segments originated from two distinct chromosomes contributing to formation of the same rear rangement strongly support a TS model of generating CGRs. The results shown here predict that CGR are formedby replication based mechanisms, and can have further implications for sporadic disease, cancer and human gene evolution. C. M. Carvalho: None. C.

Early cytogenetic studies of inversionssuggested that non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between inverted repeats could be the underlying mechanism of formation, and the prevalence of NAHR mediated inversions has been estimated to 67%. Here we used short read whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 16 unique, cytogenetically detected chromoso mal inversions and were able to characterize 10/16 (62.5%) on the nucleotide level. We found that two seemingly recurrent inversions were identical by descent and follow up analysis con ï¬rmed that the unrelated carriers shared both common and more rare haplotypes on these chromosomes. Out of the 10 inversions that we characterized in detail, nineshowed little to no microhomology in the breakpoint junctions, similar to what is commonly seen in reciprocal translocations. Only one inversion was mediated by repeats(Alu Alu ), and had duplications that had been formed con comitantly to the inversion, also through Alu Alu interac tions. Finally, the gene disruption frequency was similar tothe frequency obtained for balanced translocations (6/25 breakpoints, 24%). In summary, the study indicates that short read WGS can detect a substantial fraction of chro mosomal inversions and resolves the breakpoints on the nucleotide level. Finally, NAHR is likely not the major mechanism underlying the formation of non recurrent largechromosomal inversions.

Despite the newest sequencing technologies, the human reference genome hg38 still comprises three unresolved sequence gaps inLCR22 A. The recurrent deletion/duplication breakpoints of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) are embedded within these repeats, but the exact location remainsunclari ï¬ed. Materials and Methods: We performed an LCR22 de novo assembly using ï¬ber FISH. Long DNA molecules were extracted from cells, stretched onto coverslips, and hybridized with LCR22 speci ï¬c probes. Following manualsignal screening, alleles were de novo assembled by tiling ï¬bers based on matching colors and distances between the probes. Results: LCR22 haplotyping in 24 individuals uncovered the presence of 26 different alleles for LCR22 A. These alleles range in size between 200kb and 2Mb. Subunitscluster in larger substructures, which vary in orientation, copy number, and presence. In addition, the rearranged alleles of 22q11.2DS patients were mapped in nine families. Differences in the location of the deletion breakpoints were identi ï¬ed. Findings were validated by Bionano optical mapping. Conclusion: For the ï¬rst time, the overall architecture of the 22q11.2 locus was successfully unraveled. The LCR22 hypervariability implicates interindividual gene dosagedifferences. As a consequence, copy number variations could in ï¬uence gene expression pro ï¬les. Additionally, mapped rearrangement breakpoints vary among patients. We hypothesize this variability could provide a genetic explanation for some of the phenotypic variability char acterizing the 22q11.2DS. Funding: FWO GOE1117N, Jerome Lejeune project 1665 L.

GPR180 and TGDS were consis tently altered, but the loss of either one individually doesnot cause MCOR. The genomic architecture of the 13q32.1 region is consistent with the existence of adjacent TADs,1138the boundary of which could be altered by MCOR deletions. Methods: We generated mouse models carrying the minimal MCOR deletion (35KB) or three smaller deletions within this region encompassing binding sites for the insulator CTCF, respectively and analyzed their morpho logical, histological and molecular phenotypes. Results: Heterozygous animals carrying the 35 KB deletion display moderate reduction in pupil diameter andectopic expression of a neighboring gene in the iris starting during embryonic life, before the formation of the dilator muscle, through to adulthood. Smaller deletions encom passing putative insulator sites do not cause ectopic expression of the neighboring gene. This suggests that the 35KB MCOR deletion may lead to the adoption of a nor mally distant enhancer by the deregulated gene, due to reduced distance between the two, instead of a TAD boundary disruption. 4C sequencing to characterize thechromosomal interactions generated by the 35KB deletion and the generation of mice lacking an excellent candidate enhancer are ongoing, to assess this hypothesis. Conclusion: Here, we show that MCOR deletions alter the genomic architecture of 13q32.1 and gene expression in the developing iris, changing the fate of the progenitors thatshould give rise to the dilator muscle.

However, to date, the true scale of canonical 5 â²SS GT>GC mutations generating wild type transcripts, both in thecontext of the frequency of such mutations and the level of wild type transcripts generated from the mutation alleles, remain unknown. Herein, combining data derived from a meta analysis of 45 informative disease causing 5 â²SS GT>GC mutations (from 42 genes) and a cell culture based full length gene splicing assay of 103 5 â²SS GT>GC mutations (from 30 genes), we estimate that ~15 â18% of the canonical GT 5 â²SSs are capable of generating between 1 and 84% normal transcripts as a consequence of thesubstitution of GT by GC. We further demonstrate that the canonical 5 â²SSs whose substitutions of GT by GC generated normal transcripts show stronger complementar ity to the 5 â²end of U1 snRNA than those sites whose substitutions of GT by GC did not lead to the generation of normal transcripts. We also observed a correlation betweenthe generation of wild type transcripts and a milder than expected clinical phenotype but found that none of the available splicing prediction tools were able to accuratelypredict the functional impact of 5 â²SS GT>GC mutations. Ourï¬ndings imply that 5 â²SS GT>GC mutations may not invariably cause human disease but should also help toimprove our understanding of the evolutionary processes that accompanied GT>GC subtype switching of U2 type introns in mammals.

Vogel1 1New York University, New York, NY, United States, 2Institute of Microbiology ASCR, Prague, Czech Republic, 3Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States Introduction: The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, known as ER stress, is a hallmark of many diseases including cancer. To combat ER stress, cells employ the Unfolded Protein Response, whichincludes translation induction of stress response factors. For a subset this induction is achieved through upstream open reading frames in the 5 â²UTR, however mechanisms are not well understood for many others. Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1139Material and Methods: We performed ribosome pro ï¬l ing in human cells undergoing ER stress and searched 5 â² UTRs for ribosome enriched motifs. Using reporters, we tested signi ï¬cant motifs for their impact on protein synth esis under stress. To further characterize their function, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to engineer mutations incell lines. Results: We identi ï¬ed a short motif in the 5 â²UTR with signiï¬cant enrichment in ribosomal occupancy; reporter assays con ï¬rmed the functionality of this sequence. This new element is common among transcriptional regulators, including a key factor of the Unfolded Protein Response,and correlates with reduced translation of downstream coding regions, suggesting a translation inhibitory element. Importantly, cross referencing with The Cancer GenomeAtlas revealed overlap with cancer risk variants. Conclusion: The 5 â²UTR is a critical component of a gene; however, much is unknown regarding its role inexpression, particularly through translation. Traditional cancer exome studies miss mutations in undescribed reg ulatory regions in the UTR. The element we have dis covered not only has the potential to revise a long standing model in the ï¬eld of translation regulation, but also high lights novel mutations that may contribute to oncogenesis.

Aradhya1 1Invitae, San Francisco, CA, United States,2Center for Genomic Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States Molecular genetic testing for hereditary neuromuscular disorders has been increasingly used to con ï¬rm clinical diagnoses, identify subtype, and inform management andprognosis. These important uses of genetic testing have been corroborated in several small studies, but large data sets are needed to fully illuminate the utility and complexityof genetic analysis. Moreover, universal high resolution analysis of intragenic copy number variation (CNV) is nowpossible, enabling us to evaluate its contribution to neuromuscular disorders. We investigated a cohort of 10,782 unrelated individuals with a range of neuromuscular disorders using high coverage next generation sequencing (NGS) with simulta neous sequence and exon level CNV detection for subsetsof 232 genes related to these disorders to better understand diagnostic yield, mutation spectrum, and complexities of variant interpretation. Deï¬nitive diagnosis was obtained in 2,484 individuals (23%). Diagnostic yields ranged from 10% for dystonia to 53% for spinal muscular atrophy or dystrophinopathy. Asexpected, 94.8% of pathogenic CNVs were found in SMN1, PMP22, and DMD, however, the remaining pathogenic CNVs were found across 31 other genes and intragenicCNVs accounted for as much as 20% of all clinically sig niï¬cant results. Separately, we evaluated the rate of reclassi ï¬cation of variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance and observed that up to 15% of such variants in some genes were reclassi ï¬ed to likely pathogenic or pathogenic. Our data represent one of the largest studies demon strating the utility of NGS based genetic testing in neuro muscular disorders and the important contribution of exon level CNV analysis to inform clinical management ofindividuals with these disorders.

For 50% of individuals with dHMN, the disease causing gene is unknown. Materials and Methods: WES and WGS were used to identify the monogenic causes of dHMN. Patient derived ï¬broblasts were used to assess the functional consequence of candidate variants on splicing, protein abundance, and subcellular localization. Results: We identi ï¬ed putative pathogenic variants in GBF1 (Golgi Brefeldin A Resistant Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 1 ) in four unrelated families with domi nant or sporadic dHMN. Other known dHMN implicatedgenes were excluded. De novo or inherited mutations (c.2945G>A, p. Cys982Tyr; c.3410C>T, p. Ala1137Val; c.4382G>A, p. Arg1461Gln; and c.3524G>A, p. Trp1175*)were associated with slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy accompanied by musculoskeletal deformities (scoliosis, pes cavus, hammer toes). Electro physiological studies consistently revealed axonal motor neuropathy; three patients also had distal sensory loss. GBF1 plays a pivotal role in COPI vesicular traf ï¬cking and Golgi maintenance. Functional studies con ï¬rmed that the variants c.3410C>T, located after the 3 â²splice acceptor site (SAS), and c.4382G>A, predicted to introduce a novelSAS, do not affect splicing. Protein levels from patients ï¬broblasts con ï¬rmed GBF1 haploinsuf ï¬ciency for the W1175* mutation, whereas A1137V and R1461Q exhibitedmoderately increased GBF1 levels. Preliminary immunos taining analyses revealed Golgi fragmentation in ï¬broblast lines p. Ala1137Val and p. Arg1461Gln. Conclusion: Previous studies have linked disrupted COPI transport and Golgi fragmentation with other motor neuropathies. Our results emphasize the role of GBF1 inthese contexts and indicate that GBF1 mutations are a novel cause of dHMN. N. Mendoza Ferreira: None. M. Karakaya: None. I. HÃ¶lker: None. D. Beijer: None. B.

Unlike other tissues, cardiac and skeletal muscle only express two FXR1P isoforms that incorporate an additional exon 15. Using exome sequencing, we identi ï¬ed recessive mutations in the muscle speci ï¬c exon 15 of FXR1 in two unrelated families with congenital myopathy, one of them having a neonatal lethal phenotype. To investigate thepathogenicity of exon 15 mutations, we generated a CRISPR Cas9 mouse model carrying the same mutation as the family with lethal phenotype (delACAG) and adifferent exon 15 mutant (dupA) that results in low FXR1P levels. Mutant homozygous mice were found with decreased muscle volume, muscle strength and bone densityby MRI, behavioural tests and DEXA respectively, while histopathological studies showed muscle ï¬bers of reduced diameter, increased centralized nuclei, and type I predomi nance. Ultra structural analysis of ï¬bers from mutant mice also revealed multiple cores and Z band disruption. Notably, phenotypic severity was greater in delACAGmutants than in dupA mice. Histopathology of a triceps biopsy from a FXR1 patient was consistent with these ï¬ndings. We additionally demonstrate that the delACAG mutation leads to abnormal FXR1P isoforms which accumulate in a new type of cytoplasmic granules in human and mouse muscle cells. In conclusion, we reportthat mutations in exon 15 of FXR1 are associated with a multi minicore myopathy which varies in severity depend ing on to the effect of each mutation on the protein. This istheï¬rst time that mutations in FXR1 are demonstrated to be associated with a human condition. Funding: MINECO/ CIBERER/NINDS E. FernÃ¡ndez NÃºÃ±ez: None. M. EstaÃ±: None. M. S. Zaki: None.

Recently our studies identi ï¬ed novel mutations in MYBPC1 associated with a new form of myopathy. Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing and in silico prognostic tools were used to identify novel MYBPC1 pathogenic variants. Biochemical assays and molecular dynamics were performed to examine the impact of the MYBPC1 variants on actomyosin binding, the structure and stability of sMyBP C. A knock in mouse model containing one of the pathogenic mutations was generated. Results: We have identi ï¬ed novel autosomal dominant mutations in MYBPC1 that co segregate with a new form of myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, facial/body deformities, and tremor of possibly myogenicorigin. The individual mutations differentially affect the stability, structure and ability of sMyBP C to bind myosin. The generated knock in mouse model faithfully recapitu lates the myopathic phenotype and disease progression observed in patients. Heterozygous knock in mice are sig niï¬cantly smaller and exhibit behavioural, morphological and contractile de ï¬cits compared to their wild type littermates. Conclusion: Our work expands the range of myopathies associated with MYBPC1 mutations, which was limited to severe and lethal forms of distal arthrogryposis. We now present evidence for a MYBPC1 linked myopathy asso ciated with tremor.1142This work was supported by NIH/NIAMS (T32AR007592 17 to JG & R21AR072981 to AKK), Muscular Dystrophy Association (313579 to AKK), European Regional Develop ment Fund (No. 2010/0223/2DP/2.1.1.1.0/10/APIA/VIAA/ 025 to BL) and FULBRIGHT PROGRAM (PS00266997 to JS).

Here, we utilized exome sequencing in two siblings with progressive ataxia and muscular weakness and identi ï¬ed a novel homozygous mutation (c.3020 1G>A) in neurofascin ( NFASC) . In RNA extracted from ï¬broblasts we showed that the mutation resulted in inframe skipping of exon 26, with deprived expression of the transcript thatcorresponds to NFASC isoform NF186. To further inves tigate the disease mechanisms, we assessed the NFASC mutation in our established in vitro neural cell model. Fibroblasts from one affected sibling and the unaffected parents were reprogrammed to pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), directed to long term neuroepithelial stem cells(NESCs) and ï¬nally differentiated to neurons. In early neurogenesis, differentiating cells with a selective depletion of the NF186 isoform showed signi ï¬cantly reduced neurite outgrowth as well as fewer emerging neurites. Furthermore, whole cell patch clamp recordings of patient derived neural cells revealed a lower threshold for openings, indicatingaltered Na +channel kinetics suggesting a lower threshold for openings as compared to neural cells without theNFASC mutation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that loss of NFASC isoform NF186 causes perturbed neurogenesis and impaired neuronal biophysical properties resulting in a novel early onset autosomal recessive ataxia syndrome.

Cell free DNA (cfDNA) derived from neurological tissue holds great potential for very early detection and monitoring of neurodegeneration. Materials and Methods: We characterised DNA methylation speci ï¬c to human brain cells and brain region using genome wide epigenetic pro ï¬les and compared these with targeted deep sequencing (bisul ï¬te) of cfDNA methylation in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disease subjects. To detect brain derived cfDNA we developed anew statistical approach for analysing DNA methylation at the single molecule level using k mers. Results: We detected an acute appearance in cfDNA from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neurons (DLPFC neuron) following blast exposure within a unique cohort of active duty military personnel involved in operational breaching. We also detected brain derived cfDNA during cognitive decline within a unique cohort of type 2 diabetic patientsAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1143with and without cognitive decline in which we identi ï¬ed stage dependent patterns of DLPFC neuron cfDNA and the presence of cerebellar derived cfDNA. Finally, we identi ï¬ed signi ï¬cant (p < 0.05) DLPFC neuron cfDNA among patients with DLPFC neurodegeneration validated by longitudinal structural magnetic resonance brain imaging. Conclusion: Here we report the ï¬rst evidence of cerebral cortical neuron derived cfDNA and cerebellar cfDNA within acute neurotrauma and chronic neurodegeneration,establishing the ï¬rst class of peripheral biomarkers with speciï¬city for the cell type and brain region undergoing injury or neurodegeneration.

Insights into the molecular functions of MYOCD have been obtained from cell culturestudies and, to date, our in vivo knowledge about MYOCD comes exclusively from experimental animals. For example, expression of dominant negative Myocd disrupts myocardial differentiation in embryonic frogs, while Myocd null mice die midgestation with failed vascular smooth muscle (SM)1144cell differentiation. Here, we de ï¬ne a devastating and often lethal human congenital disease associated with inheritance of pathogenic MYOCD variants, with 14 affected indivi duals in four families. This disease manifests as a massively dilated urinary bladder, or megabladder, with a disrupted SM wall. These human results are supported by evidence ofmegabladder in two distinct mouse models with reduced Myocd levels. Together, these ï¬ndings highlight a vital role for MYOCD in mammalian organogenesis. In conclusion,we demonstrate for the ï¬rst time that variations in MYOCD result in human disease, and propose that loss of function variants in MYOCD cause semi dominant congenitalmegabladder. This has important implications for genetic counseling of families with congenital megabladder, sheds new light on bladder development, and expands thepathophysiological spectrum of inherited SM disorders.

In search of novel causative genes, we studied a family with renal in addition to skeletal, eye, ear malformations in one sibling, and ear anomalies in another sibling and their mother. Whole exome sequencing yielded a rare heterozygous missense variant in the growth differentiation factor 6 ( GDF6 ) gene known to cause autosomal dominant Klippel Feil syndrome type 1 (KFS1) in all affected family members. While skeletal and hearing abnormalities are characteristic of KFS1, renal anomalieshave not been described as a hallmark. To assess whether GDF6 is involved in the pathogenesis of renal malforma tion, we performed mutational analysis of 193 furtherpatients identifying two more cases with rare GDF6 missense variants. A CRISPR/Cas9 derived knockout in murine IMCD3 cells showing that Gdf6 deï¬ciency attenu ated cell migration was rescued by expression of human wildtype but not mutant GDF6 , indicating variant patho genicity with respect to a developmental phenotype. RNAin situ hybridization on murine embryo sections revealed expression of Gdf6 in the developing urogenital system. As gdf6 expression was also observed in the pronephros of Xenopus laevis , this model was used for in vivo gdf6 knockdown studies, resulting in impaired pronephros development in embryos with downregulated gdf6 expres sion. Altogether, we demonstrate rare heterozygous deleter ious GDF6 variants in patients with renal malformation (1.6%), and renal combined with ear, eye or skeletalanomalies (5.2%), and provide evidence for an involvement of GDF6 in early nephrogenesis.

Hauner Children âs Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany Introduction: Hereditary nephropathies are both clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders. In some patients the phenotype resembles a speci ï¬c disease, but they do not carry the established genotype (phenocopy). Exomesequencing has been successfully employed in various hereditary kidney disorders. This study shows the spectrum and frequency of phenocopies identi ï¬ed by exome sequen cing in a cohort encompassing monogenic inherited kidney disorders. Materials and Methods: 174 index patients with a pre sumed hereditary kidney disease were recruited for exome sequencing and categorized in 7 disease groups according to their clinical presentation ( Table 1 ). Variants were rated as per ACMG criteria. âLikely pathogenic âandâpathogenic â variants led to the designation âsolved case â. Results: In 52/174 (30%), a genetic diagnosis could be made, in 10/52 (19%), a phenocopy could be identi ï¬ed (6% of total cohort, see table 1). 5 phenocopies were Alport syndrome presenting clinically as FSGS/SRNS or viceversa. See Table 2 for the complete spectrum of phenocopies. Conclusion: Phenocopies where found in every 5th solved case. A comprehensive picture of phenocopies is drawn illustrating the huge spectrum of clinical presenta tions of hereditary nephropathies and highlighting thatexome sequencing is an appropriate diagnostic tool to account for this heterogeneity.

Themain reason is a defective glomerular ï¬ltration barrier allowing the passage of serum proteins, including albumin, into the urine. Largely overlooked, a failure of reabsorbingtheï¬ltered proteins in the proximal tubular segment can also lead to a mild tubular proteinuria, but it is unclear if it is harmful for the kidney. Here, we combine targeted andexome sequencing to explore the contribution of tubular genes to chronic subnephrotic proteinuria (0,5 3 g/24h). Altogether, we identi ï¬ed 24 patients with recessive mutations in the tubular uptake receptor cubilin ( CUBN) . Meta analyzing our in house genetic database, we further identify a signi ï¬cant association between loss of function CUBN mutations and proteinuric conditions. The tubular proteinuria in the CUBN patients was atypical, lacking important tubular proteinuria markers and consisting ofmore than 50% albumin. Importantly, the renal function was normal, even in old patients, suggesting that the proteinuria is benign. All identi ï¬ed mutations localize to the C terminal half of the protein, which is in contrast to the known N terminal Imerslund GrÃ¤sbeck mutations for CUBN featured by Vitamin B12 malabsorption in addition to the proteinuria. Some mutations have an allele frequency of 0.5% suggesting that this kind of proteinuria is not uncommon. This is supported by the gnomAD databaseshowing a high prevalence of damaging CUBN variants, mostly localizing to the C terminal half. In summary, we identify C terminal CUBN mutations as a common but benign cause of chronic proteinuria. M. Bedin: None. O. Boyer: None. A. Servais: None. L. Villoing GaudÃ©: None. O. Gribouval: None.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) liver iron, compared to circulating iron traits,permit detection of liver speci ï¬c susceptibility loci. We performed the ï¬rst GWAS of MRI determined liver iron in 8,289 individuals in UK Biobank and validated ourresults in 1,513 individuals from DIRECT. Liver iron was calculated from MRI data using LiverMultiScanTM. We used GEMMA, which corrects for relatedness and popula tion structure, and adjusted our model for age, sex, BMI and genotyping array. We identi ï¬ed three independent genetic variants (rs1800562 & rs1799945 in HFE, rs855791 in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron (P < 5x10 8). Both HFE and TMPRSS6 are involved in hepcidin production, the keyhormone responsible for iron balance in the body. We estimated the heritability of liver iron to be 7.39%. The most genetically correlated traits in LD score regressionanalysis were transferrin (rG ,â0.78) and ferritin (rG , 1.24) with nominal signi ï¬cant correlation. In our Mendelian randomisation analysis, we found some evidence that highercentral obesity, measured as waist to hip ratio, is casually associated with higher liver iron content (IVW P ,0.003). Phenome wide association analysis demonstrates sharedaetiology of elevated liver iron with high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, extrahepatic malignancies, neuropsychiatric, endocrine and rheumatological conditions, and an inverseassociation with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease. Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying excess liver iron are likely systemic not organ speciï¬c. Our data provides new insights into the biology of liver iron and its link to metabolic and non metabolic dis ease outcomes. H. R. Wilman: None. C. A. Parisinos: None. N. Ata baki pasdar: None. M.

Materials and Methods: To elucidate the pathogenetics of human lung development, using WGS, ES, SNP andCGH arrays, Sanger sequencing, and qPCR, we studied samples obtained from deceased individuals with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed interstitial neonatal lung disorders: acinar dysplasia (n ,14), congenital alveolar dysplasia (n ,2), and other lethal lung hypoplasias (n , 10). Seventeen family members and control individualswith 17q23.1q23.2 (n ,13), 5p12 (n ,3), or an intragenic TBX4 (n,1) deletion but without a developmental lung disease were also investigated. Results: We identi ï¬ed rare heterozygous copy number variant deletions or single nucleotide variants (SNVs) involving TBX4 (n,8 and n ,2, respectively) or FGF10 (n,2 and n ,2, respectively) in 16/26 (61%) affected individuals. In addition to TBX4 , the overlapping ~2 Mb recurrent and nonrecurrent deletions at 17q23.1q23.2 iden tiï¬ed in seven individuals with lung hypoplasia also remove a lung speci ï¬c enhancer region. Individuals with coding variants involving either TBX4 orFGF10 also harbored at least one non coding SNV in the predicted lung speci ï¬c enhancer region, which was absent in 13 control individuals with the overlapping deletions but without any structurallung anomalies. Conclusion: The occurrence of rare coding variants involving TBX4 orFGF10 with the putative hypomorphic non coding SNVs implies a complex compound inheritance of these pulmonary hypoplasias. Moreover, they support the importance of TBX4 FGF10 FGFR2 epithelial mesenchymal signaling in human lung organogenesis, and help to explain the histopathological continuum observed in these rare lethal developmental disorders of the lung (NIH R01HL137203).J.

Genome sequencing has been shown to signi ï¬cantly increase diagnostic yield and is therefore set to have a profound impact for children and young people with rare diseases. Although the current legal perspective is that children below a jurisdiction speciï¬ed age are unable to provide informed consent, young people, particularly adolescents, do frequently have the capacity to be actively involved in discussions about theirhealth. We sought to characterise the attitudes of young people towards this technology by conducting 27 interviews with 11 â18 year olds (excluding those with learning difï¬culties) taking part in the 100,000 Genomes Project. Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1149Results: Around two thirds of motivations cited by young people related to the potential bene ï¬ts to themselves, including getting a diagnosis, âpinpointing âthe gene causing the condition, understanding if the condition was inherited and might be passed on to future children, guiding treatment choices, ending further investigations and puttingan end to the ongoing question of âwhyâ. Young people donât appear to be concerned about data security or com panies having access to data, although some had concernsthe results might reveal something âlife threatening âand some were worried they would be âdisappointed âif they did not get a result. Most were realistic that a result fromgenome sequencing would not necessarily lead to their condition being cured. Conclusion: Young people are capable of grasping the potential bene ï¬ts and limitations of genome sequencing and where possible should be actively engaged in the decision making process. C.

To address this,semi structured interviews were conducted with 31 clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors from 30 institutions across Europe, Australia and Canada to explore theirexperiences with returning results from GS, including positive and negative results, unsolicited ï¬ndings (UF), and variants of uncertain signi ï¬cance (VUS), to patients. GHPs remarked that patients âreactions to receiving positive results varied; some patients are relieved or appreciative at the identi ï¬cation of a genetic cause, whilst others express negative emotions, including frustration that ï¬nding an answer does not lead to a treatment. Participants discussed the importance of managing expectations in pre test counselling sessions to minimise disappointment. GHPs felt that even though some patients/families experiencedmild distress, they generally cope quite well with receiving UF and appreciate receiving information about their increased risk. While many participants felt that most patients generally understand what a VUS means, a pro portion of GHPs found VUS quite dif ï¬cult to convey to patients and had concerns for their level of understanding. Aconsiderable proportion of participants mentioned chal lenges associated with non genetic HPs misinterpreting the signiï¬cance of VUS and conveying this information to patients. This could have negative implications for patients and impacts on their own practice. These results help us understand the challenges GHPs are experiencing in returning results from GS to patients, which has important implications for clinicians âtraining. D. F. Vears: None. K.

However, littleis known about the experience that parents of critically unwell infants and children have during the testing process and beyond. Methods: Participants were recruited as part of the Australian Genomics Acute Care study, a national rapid1150genomic diagnosis program for infants and children admitted to intensive care with suspected genetic condi tions. Pre and post test counselling was provided by genetic health professionals. Over 95% of parents offered testing gave consent. Results were available within ï¬ve days of sample receipt. Parents were surveyed >12 weeksafter results return. We explored parental experiences with consent processes, perceived impact of testing on child health, relationships and reproductive decisions. Thisquestionnaire included the Decision Regret, Short Form Genetic Counselling Outcomes and PedsQL Family Impact Module scales. Results: From 21 respondents in the ï¬rst six months (RR,54%), most felt they received enough information during pre test (n ,21, 100%) and post test (n ,18, 86%) counselling. No respondents reported decisional regret regarding testing. Perceptions varied about the bene ï¬ts of rapid genomic sequencing for the child. The majority ofrespondents (n ,13, 62%) were extremely concerned about the condition occurring in future children, regardless of their actual or self perceived recurrence risk. Eight respondents(38%) reported the test impacted their reproductive plans.

The French FIND study has been set up to determine the short and longer term bene ï¬ts and risks according to the patients/families of returning SFs from diagnostic ES. Materials and Methods: A mixed methodology imple mented in three centers of expertise. This study offered to 330 patients with an undiagnosed developmental disorder the search for actionable a list of SFs from ES: SF1) pre disposition to late onset diseases (122 genes); SF2) carrier status of recessive or X linked diseases that could impact reproductive projects (114 genes); SF3) pharmacogenomicvariants that could impact medical treatment (3 genes). Results: Quantitative data show that 21% of patients did not wish to access SFs, citing anxiety, timing, or the studyconstraints. 94% wished to access all SFs; 2% refused SF1, 1.6% SF2 and 3% SF3. Semi directive interviews were scheduled with 15 patients whose SF results were positive,immediately after the results were returned. None of the patients expressed regrets regarding access to the SFs. Patients found it dif ï¬cult to anticipate the psychological consequences of announcing an elevated risk of disease (SF1). Heterozygous carrier patients found it dif ï¬cult to imagine the effects of sharing their results with theirfamilies (SF2). As for SF3, the medical bene ï¬ts were not yet clear. Conclusion: Literature showed that patients/families massively desire to know all SFs in hypothetical situations,Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1151contrasting with a 21% of refusal and with psychological effects in a real life context.

31460,"1KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,2McGill, Montreal, QC, Canada Access to detailed variant data is key to inform and verify the interpretation of genomic data. Clinical laboratories can play a signi ï¬cant role in sharing patients âdata through public variant databases. In order to facilitate data sharing,various public databases such as ClinVar (in collaboration with ClinGen) and DECIPHER have been established, which accept data submission from laboratories, clinicians,researchers and patients. Despite clear bene ï¬ts to sharing, questions may arise about the adequate form of consent to be obtained from patients when sharing data from theirclinical tests through public databases. In particular, how much information should be communicated to the patients regarding data sharing? Should patients have the option toopt out? Under what conditions could laboratories share more detailed information (e.g. supporting individual level data) about the patients than simply the aggregate variant level classi ï¬cations? In order to address these questions, we conducted a content analysis of the relevant consent policies of the major public databases and of the consent forms ofclinical laboratories who share variant data. Our study showed that despite the guidance provided by the data repositories, the approaches towards consent vary across thestudied laboratories. Moreover, we analyzed the informa tion provided in the consent forms regarding the risks of re identi ï¬cation and the potential for further contact for research. We concluded with providing further analysis on the adequacy of the current consent and privacy policies of the laboratories and databases in the view of relevant data protection regulations. M.

The aim is noble: to increase data sharing which facilitates reproducibility and new discoveries. However, data deposit requirements may con ï¬ict with ethical and legal obligations, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The main obstacles relate toi) loss of control over further processing; ii) realization of rights and obligations; iii) national derogations; iv) jurisdictional issues; and v) accountability. These ethicaland legal challenges of depositing individual level genetic data in research repositories such as dbGaP will be described and illustrated with practical real life examplesfrom some of Europe âs largest biobanks. The framework of research data deposition, if not adapted, could lead to the unwanted consequence of researchers complying with thelaw facing dif ï¬culties publishing their work, irrespective of its scienti ï¬c qualities. Such de facto inequities in the1152scienti ï¬c evaluation process, may endanger scienti ï¬c excellence and evidence based medicine. In addition to bringing current repositories in compliance, further poten tial solutions to optimize responsible data sharing will be described, including i) dynamic consent, ii) data tagging, and iii) federated data sharing. The policy paper springs outfrom work done in the COST Action CHIP ME, an EU funded European research network of researchers working on ethics and law related to genomics.

We validated a next generation sequencing method with high depth of coverage to detect mosaic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, and copy number variants (CNVs) using Genome in a Bottle (GiaB) sample dilution series. In a clinical cohort of 421,220 individuals, we identi ï¬ed 1,799 mosaic SNVs and small indels and 84 mosaic CNVs across 245 genes,corresponding to 0.6% of reported variants. This represents an incidence of 0.9% among individuals who had at least one reported variant. Approximately 40% of mosaicvariants were classi ï¬ed as likely or de ï¬nitively pathogenic and these contributed to 1.1% of de ï¬nitive diagnoses in this cohort. Nearly 80% of clinically signi ï¬cant mosaic variants were associated with autosomal dominant disorders. There were nearly twice as many cancer related genes with mosaicvariants relative to those associated with pediatric, neuro logical, or cardiovascular disorders. Later onset diseases were associated with lower levels of mosaicism in affected individuals compared to diseases with early onset (p , 0.002; Wilcoxon signed rank). In relation to hereditary cancer, individuals with mosaic variants were considerablyolder than those without mosaic variants (p ,6.5 X 10 â48; Student âs t test). Finally, among individuals who had a disease with pathognomonic features, those with mosaicvariants showed non classical phenotypes compared to those with non mosaic variants (p ,0.0009; Fisher âs exact test).

UPD can cause genetic disorders by disrupting imprinting or homozygosingheterozygous disease alleles. We present data on chromosomal scale UPD detection using whole genome sequence (WGS) data from parent child pairs in the RareDisease programme of the UK âs 100,000 Genomes Project. Routine quality control ï¬ags duos with atypical identity by descent sharing patterns or elevated Mendelian inconsis tency rates; signatures typical of UPD are reviewed to conï¬rm and characterise the event. We have currently identi ï¬ed 42 UPD events (27 maternal, 14 paternal) at a rate of 0.34%. Both parents were sequenced for 37 events. Thirty eight involved wholeAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1153chromosomes while four were partial. Only four hetero disomy events were detected, whereas isodisomy and mixed iso and heterodisomy occurred at similar frequencies. For 38 families UPD was detected in the only affected family member so could plausibly be the cause of the rare disorder. Thirteen events occurred on ï¬ve chromosome/parent com binations where UPD can cause imprinting disorders, enabling potential diagnoses invisible to small variant pipelines. Clinical interpretation has been completed for 9/42 families. Four events were con ï¬rmed from four attempts and three cases reported as solved. All three cases resultedfrom UPD homozygosing the disease allele (n ,2) or dis rupting imprinting (n ,1).

However, next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are providing useful andunprecedented tools that can be applied to reveal unex plored mechanisms. We combine single cell DNA sequen cing and high coverage (250X whole genome) DNAsequencing in three normal individuals to identify somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) that arose during embryogenesis, and use them as forensic barcodes for celllineage tracing in postmortem adult humans. Analysis of 1,000 single neurons and non neuronal cells isolated from asingle individual generates a dense lineage tree that allows us to obtain the clonal structure of developmental variants for this individual. Variant deep targeted sequencing on bulk DNA extracted from serial coronal sections of an entire human cerebral hemisphere reveals gradual, clonal segrega tion across the cortex with a persistent polyclonal end result,while analysis of 22 other organs and tissues reveals a mosaic architecture of organs deriving from distinct germ layers. Inferring the developmental cell stages of variantoccurrence discloses key aspects of human embryogenesis and numbers of effective progenitor cells at different steps such as blastocyst formation and gastrulation. We show thatsSNVs permit cell lineage maps of any human at postmortem, of density and breadth limited only by sequencing depth, with clonal analyses directly revealingkey aspects of human embryonic development.

We generated WGS data from freshly isolated single cells clonally expanded in vitro (N ,69) and created a genetic atlas of somatic mutations in healthy human tissues (kidney, skin,subcutaneous fat and visceral fat). Multi organ biopsies from the same individual allowed well controlled inspection of tissue speci ï¬c differences, while donors of two age groups (30s and 60s) provided data on the effects of aging. This analysis, complemented with a meta analysis of somatic mutations from healthy (N ,161) and tissue matched cancer genomes (N ,192), showed a stereotyped mutational pattern across multiple cell types. Conversely,1154cells derived from the kidney tubules grouped into two separate populations showing either the stereotyped or a unique mutation pattern with high mutation burden, high signatures SBS5 and SBS40 and enrichment of mutations in transcribed genes. These ï¬ndings challenged the concept of a tissue speci ï¬c mutation accumulation and instead sup ported the idea that speci ï¬c mutagenic processes shape the genome of distinct cell types. A number of cells, including fat, skeletal muscle, kidney and blood progenitors, showedno signs of exposure to external mutagens, but a common âbasal mutagenesis âthat we have characterised. The DNA repair machinery counteracted the basal mutagenesis butwas less ef ï¬cient with aging and continuous mutagen exposure. Complete understanding of the mutagenic forces active in healthy cells will be important for the preventionof mutations and consequent cancer development.

Thus, genetic basis of MCD still remained poorly understood. Materials and Methods: The M. U.S. T.A. R.D. cohort gathers DNA from skin biopsies of patients with develop ment anomalies including MCD and their parents, pheno typed at the reference center for rare diseases MAGEC (Dijon), and referred to either targeted ultra deep sequen cing (60,000X) of candidate genes, or trio exome sequen cing (ES) at 200X. Data are analysed with a tailored pipeline, allowing detection of low rate nucleotidic varia tions or chromosomal events (mosaic CNV, mosaic uni parental disomy (UPD)). Results: From 2014 to 2019, 122 patients were included. ES was performed for 42, with identi ï¬cation of mosaic SNV in 5 candidate genes in 10 patients, and mosaic CNV (monosomy/trisomy/tetrasomy/triploidy) or UPD in 9. Based on the recognisable clinical presentations thereforeidenti ï¬ed, we selected 40 patients for targeted sequencing of at least one candidate gene, with a con ï¬rmed mosaic SNV in 14, and a global diagnostic yield of 40%. Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of a versatile bioinformatic approach combined to a clinical expertise, to decipher the chromosomal and molecularaetiologies of developmental anomalies with MCD. It also pinpoints common pathogenesis pathways, which will help enhancing our understanding of MCD, and may ultimatelyresult in novel therapeutic opportunities. A. Sorlin: None. V. Carmignac: None.

The phenotype include arteriosclerosis, loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, calciï¬cation and increased arterial stiffness. A similar vascular phenotype is also observed in children with thepremature aging disease Hutchinson Gilford progeria syn drome (HGPS). HGPS is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the LMNA gene, c.1824C>T. This mutation leads to increased production of a truncated protein, progerin, and dysregulation of cell functions. Progerin has been found at low levels in skin and arteries from non progeroid individuals, but the underlaying mechanism is unknown. Materials and Methods: Here we analyzed the presence of progerin in epigastric arteries obtained from CKD stage 5 patients (GFR <15 ml/min) and controls, and its contribu tion to premature vascular aging. Somatic mutation analysisincluded DNA extracted from progerin stained sections from CKD arteries (n ,27), using digital droplet PCR. Results: Immuno ï¬uorescence showed progerin positive cells in 70% of the arteries (46Â±2 yrs, n ,40). Progerin was detected in up to 7.4% of cells. The number of progerin positive cells correlated with number of years with the disease ( P,0.03, r ,0.34). The arteries with higher fre quency of progerin had an increased activation of DNA repair ( P,0.005, r ,0.63). Somatic mutation analysis identi ï¬ed the LMNA c.1824C>T mutation in blood and arteries. Conclusion: Our results suggest that rare somatic muta tions may become a risk when increased tissue regeneration is induced, and provide novel mechanistic insight to the underlying phenotype of premature vascular aging.

31468,"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, United KingdomBackground: Developing insight into tissue speci ï¬c tran scriptional mechanisms can help improve our understanding of how genetic variants exert their effects on complex traits and disease. By applying the principles of Mendelian randomization, we have undertaken a systematic analysis to evaluate transcriptome wide associations between geneexpression and 395 complex traits across 48 different tissue types. Results: Overall, we identi ï¬ed 59,810 gene trait asso ciations in at least 1 tissue type based on multiple testing and genetic colocalization corrections. These results indi cate that genetic effects expressed more ubiquitously acrossdifferent tissues are more likely to be pleiotropic (i.e. associated with multiple diverse phenotypes). We have also explored these results in detail with a series of analyses thathighlight tissue dependent effects. For instance, TPO, NR3C2 andSPATA13 expression was only associated with thyroid disease in thyroid tissue, whereas FBN2 was asso ciated with both cardiovascular and lung function traits but only when analysed in heart and lung tissue respectively. We also demonstrate that phenome wide investigations of our results can be valuable for drug validation purposes. Finally, we have evaluated the tissue dependency of ï¬nd ings from genome wide association studies (GWAS). Thissuggested that integrating tissue speci ï¬c data with GWAS results can help elucidate the causal genes and tissues responsible for effects, as well uncover putative novelï¬ndings. Conclusion: The atlas of tissue dependent associations we have constructed should prove extremely insightful tofuture studies investigating the genetic determinants of complex disease.

Since many in ï¬ammatory markers are both correlated and associated with multiple diseases, we aimed to leverage correlated biomarkers in discovery of disease related genetic variants. We used data from the population based FINRISK Study of up to 26,705 Finns and imputed genotypes to 13M var iants. We analyzed 66 cardiovascular or immunologicrelevant traits, including anthropometric and biomarkers such as blood lipids and in ï¬ammatory markers. Out of the 66 traits, hierarchical clustering identi ï¬ed one highly cor related cluster, comprised of 12 in ï¬ammatory markers mainly interleukins and growth factors. We then performed multivariate GWAS on this cluster using metaCCA, asummary statistic based multivariate method applying Canonical Correlation Analysis. Using multivariate method, we observed 89 genome wide signiï¬cant loci, a substantial increase over the full set of 28 that were genome wide signi ï¬cant in one or more of the 12 traits. To illustrate, protective variant for pulmonaryembolism rs4656185 in F5 was genome wide signi ï¬cant only using multivariate method (multivariate p value , 7.9e 20, smallest univariate p value ,9.9e 4). In addition, out of 89 genome wide signi ï¬cant loci 13 were reported to associate with at least one of the traits in the cluster, 7 with other cytokines or leukocyte counts and 19 with at least one disease endpoint (p < 1e 5) in GWAS catalog, UKBB or FinnGen. In conclusion, our study shows how multivariate method provides a remarkable boost in power for locusdiscovery, but also emphasizes the advantage of large biobank based phenome wide screening. S. E.

For this purpose we mapped population based variation from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and disease causing mutations from the HumanGene Mutation Database (HGMD) onto 5,250 Pfam protein domain families. We then aggregated population based and disease causing variants across 30,853 homologous proteindomains into 2,750 meta domains. Weï¬nd that genetic tolerance is consistent across 97% of domain homologues (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), andthat patterns of genetic tolerance faithfully mimic patterns of evolutionary conservation (Pearson 0.97, p value < 1e 308). Interestingly, we ï¬nd that 2,201 of the aggregated domain positions are not evolutionary conserved, but highly intolerant to population based variation and contain at least one disease causing missense variant. An informativeexample concerns domain positions 17 and 21 in the âEGF like domain â(PF00008). These positions are not conserved but are depleted of population based variation in 60 genesand additionally cause disease in the NOTCH3 ,JAG1 , and CRB2 genes. Furthermore, we ï¬nd that the presence of disease causing missense variants at aggregated homo logous domain positions is often paired with the absence of population variation and vice versa . We realized that this information could be of great bene ï¬t to the genetic community and therefore developed Meta Dome; a fast and easy to use web server that visualizes meta domain information and gene wide pro ï¬les of genetic tolerance. MetaDome allows to easily investigate variants of interest for the presence or absence of variation at corre sponding positions within homologous domains and isfreely accessible at https://stuart.radboudumc.nl/metadome .

We further expand upon this concept by investigating and selecting facial resemblances between full siblings in order to identify genomic regionsthat underlie normal range facial variation. Methods: 3D facial shape was subdivided into distinct segments and a sibling matching experiment was per formed. This led to the identi ï¬cation of phenotypically similar sib pairs from which their common facial traits were derived, each representing global or local aspects of facialmorphology that were informative for accurately matching the siblings. Subsequently, these traits (N ,1592) were projected onto two independent European samples (N1 , 4680, N2 ,3566) and genome wide meta analyses were conducted. Results: Consistent with the literature on facial herit ability, the sibling derived traits mainly captured variations involving the full face in addition to the nasal and orbital regions. We identi ï¬ed 11,661 single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) at 310 separate loci that reached genome wide signi ï¬cance (P < 5Ã10 â8), inï¬uencing both global aspects of the face as well as local (e.g. the tip of thenose) aspects only. The majority of the associated segments represented variations in the nose. Conclusion: We here report a data driven approach to facial phenotyping starting from facial similarities observed between siblings. Complex shape transformations were converted into simple univariate descriptions of facial shapethrough vector projections, allowing for the use of standard meta analysis techniques in testing for genotype phenotype associations. Signi ï¬cant associations were found among 310 loci, further enhancing our understanding of the genetic basis of human facial shape.1158H. Hoskens: None. K. Indencleef: None. J. Li: None. J. D.

However, many of Mendelian syndromes are still not represented byexisting NGP tools as their disease causing gene has not been identi ï¬ed yet. We therefore propose a facial gestalt matching approach to quantify the similarity among patientsand further explore the unknown genotype phenotype relationship. Materials and Methods: We compiled a dataset con sisting of 679 patients with 105 different monogenic dis orders. For each individual a frontal photo and the disease causing mutation were available. We used additional net work architectures such as FaceNet to extract facial embeddings and constructed a Clinical Face Phenotype Space (CFPS) that was corrected for the confoundingeffects of age and ethnicity. Results: Given only the phenotypes as input we could visualize molecular interactions of genes by their closeproximity in the CFPS. A prominent cluster was formed e.g. byBRAF ,PTPN11 and other genes of the MAPKinase pathway that result in disorders such as Noonan or LEO PARD syndrome and which are considered similar. Beyond this proof of concept, we were able to match two unrelated patients with a novel progeria like facial phenotype withunknown molecular cause. They were also in close proxi mity to cases with mutations in LMNA and PYCR1 and exome sequencing identi ï¬ed in these patients the same de novo mutation in a novel disease gene that can also be assigned to nuclear envelopathies.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed on peripheral blood derived DNA of the affected siblings revealed two novel heterozygous variants, p. K537N (paternal) and p.

Such phenotype was rescued with wild type LIG3 mRNA, but not with mRNA encoding the two variants, indicating a loss of function mechanism. The p.

The mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) is the sole RNA polymerase in mitochondria and isresponsible for mtDNA transcription. Patients and Methods: Using whole exome sequencing, we identi ï¬ed novel recessive and dominant POLRMT var iants in ï¬ve individuals presenting with a variety of clinical problems, ranging from global developmental delay, hypotonia and growth defects in childhood to late onsetprogressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Where investigated, these defects were accompanied by either a mosaic cytochrome coxidase de ï¬ciency in skeletal muscle and/or multiple respiratory chain enzyme de ï¬ciencies. Mitochondrial mRNA and OXPHOS protein levels were assessed in mutant POLRMT ï¬broblasts. In addition, we studied recombinant mutant POLRMT proteins to deter mine the effect of POLRMT variants on mitochondrial transcriptional activity in vitro. Results: Functional characterisation of patient ï¬broblasts revealed a defect in mitochondrial mRNA synthesis, although no mtDNA deletions or copy number abnormal ities were identi ï¬ed. Mild decreases in the levels of both OXPHOS subunits and fully assembled complexes were observed in vivo, whilst functional in vitro characterisationof the investigated recombinant POLRMT variants revealed that patient mutations exhibited variable, but deleterious effects on mitochondrial transcription. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that pathogenic variants in the POLRMT gene can cause a spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from childhood onset devel opmental delay to late onset PEO and emphasise the importance of defective mitochondrial transcription as a disease mechanism.

Mutations in nuclear genes encoding factors involved in mitochondrial translationresult in isolated or multiple OXPHOS de ï¬ciencies and mitochondrial disease. Here, we report the identi ï¬cation of disease causing variants in the MRPS28 gene, encoding the small mitoribosomal subunit (mtSSU) protein bS1m in a patient with intrauterine grow th retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay. Whole exomesequencing helped identify a seemingly homozygous missense variant NM_014018.2:c.356A>G, p. (Lys119Arg) which affected a highly conserved lysineresidue. The variant was present in the mother in a heterozygous state, but not in the father who likely carried a large deletion spanning exon 2 and parts of introns 1 and2 that could account for the apparent homozygosity of the patient. PCR ampli ï¬cation and Sanger sequencing of MRPS28 cDNA from patient ï¬broblasts revealed the presence of a truncated MRPS28 transcript, which lacked exon 2. Molecular and biochemical characterization of patient ï¬broblasts revealed a decrease in the abundance of the bS1m protein, decreased abundance of assembled mtSSU and inhibited mitochond rial translation. Conse quently, OXPHOS biogenesis and cellular respirationwere compromised in these cells. Expression of wild type MRPS28 restored mitoribosomal as sembly, mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS biogenesis, thereby demonstrat ing the deleterious nature of the identi ï¬edMRPS28 variants. Thus, MRPS28 joins the increasing number ofnuclear genes encoding mitorib osomal struct ural proteins linked to mitochondrial disease. J. Pulman: None. B. Ruzzenente: None. L. Bianchi: None. M.

More than half of individuals with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS), who carry thepathogenic variant m.3243A>G in their mtDNA, have depression as a comorbidity. Mechanistic insights into mitochondrial dysfunction in psychiatric diseases arelargely elusive. Here, we reprogramed skin ï¬broblasts from MELAS patients with comorbid depression into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These cells exhibitedisogenic nuclear DNA but different levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy ( i.e.:0 and >80%) in m.3243A>G mutation. Next, we differentiated iPS cells into excitatory corticalneurons (iNeurons). We found that high levels of m.3243A>G heteroplasmy (>80%) resulted in mitochon drial dysfunction, accompanied by reduced span andcomplexity of the dendritic arbors, as well as a reduction in axonal mitochondria. Furthermore, we found fewer excitatory synapses and accordingly a lower frequency ofspontaneous postsynaptic currents. Neuronal network recordings from microelectrode arrays showed less activity in general, as well as a decrease in synchronous networkbursts. We now provide conceptual advance on how impaired neuron energy metabolism disrupts synaptic structure and function, dendritic complexity, as well asnetwork activity and synchronicity. These speci ï¬c neuronal features are impaired to various degrees in psychiatric diseases as well. Overall, our results show that iNeurons arean effective disease model for improving our understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the aetiology of psychopathology. iNeurons could also serve as screeningplatforms for novel genetic and/or pharmacological ther apeutic discoveries.

By trio exome sequencing, the homo zygous missense variant c.797G>A p.(Cys266Tyr) in PISD was found in both affected individuals. PISD encodes phosphatidylserine decarboxylase that is localized in theinner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the decarbox ylation of phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in mammalian cells. PE occurs at high abundance inthe mitochondrial membranes, and structural properties of this phospholipid play an important role for various mitochondrial functions. To characterize the functionaleffects of the PISD missense variant we used ï¬broblasts derived from one patient and healthy individuals. Western blot analysis revealed no difference in PISD protein amountin patient and control derived ï¬broblasts. In contrast to the control ï¬broblasts, patient cells showed fragmented mito chondrial morphology. Treatment of patient ï¬broblasts with MG 132 or staurosporine to induce oxidative stress followed by the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway showed signi ï¬cantly decreased cell viability with increased caspase 3 and â7 activation. Remarkably,ethanolamine supplementation largely restored cell viability and enhanced apoptosis in MG 132 stressed patient cells. Our data demonstrate that the bi allelic hypomorphic PISD variant p.(Cys266Tyr) is associated with a novel SEMD form, which may be treatable with PE or ethanolamine administration.

Pathogenic mutations in POLG/Twinkle impair mtDNA replication and cause mitochondrial dysfunctionleading to human infantile or late onset phenotypes. Materials and Methods: We analyzed by whole exome sequencing ï¬ve families with an optic atrophy spectrum disorder, including retinal dystrophy and kidney insuf ï¬ ciency, associated with mtDNA depletion. Functional experiments evaluating effects of potentially pathogenicvariants on protein amount and multimerization, mtDNA replication and cellular bioenergetics were performed in vitro and/or in patients âï¬broblasts. Optic nerve size was measured in zebra ï¬sh after knock down and wildtype or mutant overexpression. Results: We identi ï¬ed four heterozygous and one homozygous missense mutations in the SSBP1 gene. They affect mtDNA maintenance and replication, leading to mtDNA depletion, which resulted in a variable phenotypeof impaired oxidative phosphorylation, observed either in ï¬broblasts or in affected tissues (kidney and skeletal mus cle). SSBP1 suppression in zebra ï¬sh reduced optic nerve size, a phenotype rescued by wild type protein but not by the SSBP1 mutations, suggesting that all dominant muta tions induced loss of function, whereas the recessivebehaved as a hypomorph. Conclusion: Mutations in SSBP1 cause defects in mtDNA replication, mitochondrial dysfunction and human disease. Further investigations will contribute to improve knowledge about mtDNA replication, and enlarge the landscape of phenotypic expression of mitochondrial dis eases in humans.

C27 Developmental disorders 2C27.1 Diagnostic utility of genome wide DNA methylation testing in genetically unsolved patients with suspected hereditary conditions B. sadikovicLondon Health Sciences Centre, Canada, London, ON, Canada Conventional genetic testing of patients with neurodevelop mental presentations and congenital anomalies (ND/CA),i.e., the analysis of sequence and copy number variants, leaves a substantial proportion of the patients unexplained. Some of these cases have been shown to result from DNAmethylation defects at a single locus ( epi variants ), while others can exhibit syndrome speci ï¬c DNA methylation changes across multiple loci ( epi signatures ). Here, we investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of genome wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood in unre solved ND/CA patients. We generate a computationalmodel enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using peripheral blood DNA methylation data with full accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of this model to resolve 67patients with uncertain clinical diagnoses, some of whom had VUS âs in the related genes. We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of thecases, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA patients without a previousdiagnostic assumption and separate assessment of rare epi variants in this cohort, we identify 15 patients with syndromic genetic disorders, 12 patients with imprintingand trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 patients with rare epi variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the patients â phenotype. This study demonstrates that genomic DNA methylation analysis can facilitate the molecular diagnosis of unresolved clinical cases, and highlights the potentialvalue of epigenomic testing in the routine clinical assess ment of patients with ND/CA.

The Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford(CUD), a clinical site of the NIH funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, evaluates patients with rare, undiag nosed diseases in an effort to diagnose patients, improvemechanistic knowledge of diseases, and accelerate bioinfor matics tool development. Methods: We reviewed the ï¬rst 400 applicants to the CUD to identify phenotypic characteristics, demographics, and prior genetics evaluations. 147 patients were enrolled with both subjective and objective evidence of undiagnosed disease. Exome sequencing, sequence reanalysis focused on novel variant and gene discovery, and beyond exome approaches including short and long read genomesequencing, RNAseq, untargeted metabolomics, immu nomics, and model systems were applied to attempt to ï¬nd a diagnosis for each of these participants. Results: The most common predominantly affected sys tems of applicants include neurologic, musculoskeletal, and immunologic. Among the 147 enrolled participants to date,114 have had evaluations completed, 34 participants received a con ï¬rmed diagnosis using a variety of clinical, genomic and research approaches. Speci ï¬c evaluations and additional research studies are determined on a case by case bases by CUD clinician scientists due to the diversity of presentation and prior work up of each participant. To date,the CUD has found a strong candidate diagnosis for 10 (9%) patients. Each candidate diagnosis is undergoing fur ther functional investigation. Conclusions: Together with local and international col laborators, a multiomic approach to undiagnosed patients has found success in the diagnosis and characterization ofrare diseases.

The diverse histological patterns of hair follicle tumours seen in this syndrome suggest genetic heterogeneity across these tumours. Methods: To investigate this, we comprehensively pro ï¬led the genomic landscape of 42 benign and malignant tumours across 13 individuals in 4 multigenerationalfamilies with CYLD cutaneous syndrome (CCS; syn. Brooke Spiegler syndrome). Results: We found recurrent mutations in epigenetic modiï¬ersDNMT3A and BCOR in 29% of tumours. Inte grated genomic and methylation pro ï¬ling suggest that mutant DNMT3A drives tumourigenesis mechanisticallythrough Wnt/Ã catenin pathway signaling. In malignant tumours, epigenetic modi ï¬ers CREBBP, KDM6A and EP300 were mutated. Some patients were heterozygous for loss of function mutations in MBD4 , with biallelic muta tions demonstrated in a poorly differentiated malignant skin tumour with an associated increase in mutational burdenand the accrual of epigenetic modi ï¬ers. To obtain insights into mechanisms that cause these mutations, mutational signature analysis was performed, and revealed UV relatedsignatures in sun exposed lesions but not sun protected tumours suggesting that non UV related mechanisms con tribute towards CCS tumourigenesis. We also demonstratethat cutaneous tumours that metastasize to the lung carry a targetable recurrent driver mutation in AKT, and a UV signature, supporting the origin from the skin. Conclusion: These ï¬ndings add new dimensions to the existing paradigms of UV induced skin cancer and high light the utility of studying rare disease to gain novelinsights into genetic mechanisms of tumour formation.

Girisha1 1Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Manipal, India,2Center of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp and Antwerp University Hospital,, Antwerp, Belgium, Belgium Cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH), anauxetic dysplasia 1 and anauxetic dysplasia 2 are rare metaphyseal dysplasias caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in RMRP and POP1 , which encode the components of RNAse MRP endoribonuclease complex (RMRP) in ribosomal biogenesis pathway. Nucleolus and neural progenitor protein(NEPRO), encoded by NEPRO (C3ORF17) interacts with multiple protein subunits of RMRP. We report a biallelic pathogenic variant in NEPRO , which could disrupt the normal function of RMRP and cause a similar skeletal dysplasia. We ascertained a 6 year old girl, with skeletal dysplasia resembling CHH. Analysis of parents child trioexomes and effect of the variant on protein structure and stability were performed. Two families with four affected individuals with a skeletal dysplasia and a homozygousmissense variant, c.280C>T (p. Arg94Cys) in NEPRO , were identi ï¬ed from literature and their phenotype was critically re evaluated. RMRP andPOP1 in proband did not harbor any causative variant. Trio exome sequencing identi ï¬ed a possible homozygous candidate variant, c. 435G>C (p. Leu145Phe) in NEPRO . All the ï¬ve affected individuals have short stature, acromelia, skin laxity, joint hypermobi lity and dislocations. They also have short metacarpals, broad middle phalanges, narrow acetabular angle andmetaphyseal irregularities. Protein modeling and stability prediction showed that the mutant protein has decreased stability. The reported variants are in the same domain ofthe protein. We report the identi ï¬cation and characterization of a new syndrome caused by biallelic variants in NEPRO inï¬ve patients with features resembling CHH and thus expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of ribosome biogenesis pathway related skeletal dysplasia.

Independent genome and exome sequen cing, identi ï¬ed the same causative variant in ALPK1 inï¬ve families*. We present phenotypic and functional studies characterising additional in ï¬ammatory, ciliary and centro somal abnormalities in six affected individuals from one of the families. Materials and Methods: ROSAH syndrome patients heterozygous for ALPK1 , c.710C>T, [p. Thr237Met]), underwent immunological, cerebral MRI, bone marrow and ophthalmic investigations. Centrosomal and primary ciliaryanalyses were conducted in human ï¬broblasts, ARPE 19 and HeLa cells. HeLa cells were subject to overexpression of mutant and wildtype ALPK1, and ALPK1 knockdown. ALPK1 isoform characterisation was undertaken in human and mouse tissues. Results: Additional clinical features indicated innate immunity dysfunction with marked susceptibility to viral infections, and indication of abnormal in ï¬ammatory responses including cerebral manifestations. Primary ciliaryand centrosomal abnormalities in cell culture investigations suggested a possible gain of function disease mechanism. ALPK1 isoform differences were identi ï¬ed in human and mouse retina providing additional insight to disease mechanisms. Conclusion: Heterozygous abnormality in ALPK1 leads to the multisystem ROSAH disorder through impact on retinal and other tissues. There are primary cilia and cen trosomal abnormalities as well as indicators of immunesystem dysfunction, and a likely gain of function disease mechanism. *ALPK1 missense pathogenic variant in ï¬ve families leads to ROSAH syndrome, an ocular multisystem auto somal dominant disorder.

Following exclusion of knowngenes in a multi generation family, we mapped the locus to Xq26.3 â27.2. Analysis of genome sequence data excluded coding variants in all genes in the interval, and revealedsplit reads, indicative of a potential structural variant. Using long range PCR and DNA walking, we identi ï¬ed a 57 Kb inter chromosomal insertion of chr9p24.3, within anintergenic palindromic region on chrXq27.1. Structural variants can modulate mechanisms of gene regulation, affect gene dosage, or as a result of position effects,inï¬uence the expression of genes proximal or distal to the breakpoints. We hypothesised that retinal degeneration is caused by dysregulated gene expression, either near thepalindrome, or driven by expression of chr9p24.3 tran scripts from the X chromosome. To explore the mechanism of disease with the insertion in genomic and cellularcontext, we reprogrammed patient ï¬broblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated 3D retinal organoids. RNAseq analysis of patient retinal organoids,compared to controls, revealed transcriptional dysregulation at this locus. Further analysis of the downstream effects includes immunostaining to assess retinal organoid mor phology and protein expression. We have subsequently identi ï¬ed another family with a different inter chromosomal insertion within the same intergenic palindromic region ofchrX. These studies identify a new genomic mechanism for retinal degeneration, and the utility of patient iPSC derived retinal organoids to investigate dysregulated gene expres sion as the likely cause of disease.

Here we describe the ï¬rst tranche of large scale exome sequence data for 49,960 study participants, revealing approximately 4 million coding variants (ofwhich ~98.4% have frequency <1%). The data includes 231,631 predicted loss of function variants, a >10 fold increase compared to imputed sequence for the sameparticipants. Nearly all genes (>97%) had â¥1 predicted loss of function carrier, and most genes (>69%) had â¥10 loss of function carriers. We illustrate the power of characterizingloss of function variation in this large population through association analyses across 1,741 phenotypes. In addition to replicating a range of established associations, we discovernovel loss of function variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 andGMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of1166pathogenic variants of clinical signi ï¬cance in this popula tion, ï¬nding that 2% of the population has a medically actionable variant. Additionally, we leverage the phenotypic data to characterize the relationship between rare BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants and cancer risk.

To date, >35 genes have been linked to JBTS, but for many families the genetic cause remains unknown. All JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or functionof the primary cilium, an antenna like organelle essential for signal transduction. A majority of JBTS proteins formAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1167complexes at the ciliary transition zone, which acts as a gatekeeper controlling ciliary protein content.

In this work, we utilize tandem af ï¬nity puriï¬cation and yeast two hybrid screens to ï¬nd protein interactors of ARMC9. We identify a novel ciliary modulecomposed of two known JBTS proteins (ARMC9, CEP104) and two proteins not currently associated with human disorders (TOGARAM1, CCDC66). We ï¬nd variants in TOGARAM1 in individuals with JBTS, and show that variants located in the TOG2 domain disrupt the interaction with ARMC9. We generate CRISPR edited armc9 and togaram1 zebra ï¬sh mutants which display reduced numbers of shortened cilia and typical ciliopathy phenotypes including curved bodies and pronephric cysts. Patientï¬broblasts with ARMC9 orTOGARAM 1 mutations display ciliary abnormalities with axonemal shortening and reduced levels of post translational modi ï¬cations (acetylation and polyglutamylation), which are also found in our zebra ï¬sh models.

We created deep reference mapsof DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from 733 human biosamples encompassing 439 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to precisely delineate andnumerically index ~3.6 million DHSs encoded within the human genome, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that the expansive scale ofcell and tissue states sampled exposes an unprecedented degree of stereotyped actuation of large sets of elements, signaling the operation of distinct genome scale regulatoryprograms. We show further that the complex actuation patterns of individual elements can be capturedcomprehensively by a simple regulatory vocabulary re ï¬ect ing their dominant program.

This is well illustrated by Branchiooculofacial Syndrome (BOFS), a rare congenital disorder mainly characterized by craniofacial malformations and orofacialcleft (OC). BOFS is caused by heterozygous mutations within TFAP2A , a master regulator of neural crest cells (NCC) and craniofacial development for which humans, butnot mice, are haploinsuf ï¬cient. Here we present a BOFS patient carrying a heterozygous inversion with one break point located downstream of TFAP2A . As several hetero zygous translocations breakpoints and risk haplotypes located downstream of TFAP2A were previously also associated with OC we asked if this region is importantforTFAP2A expression in NCC derived from hiPSCs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology we showed that TFAP2A is located within a Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) containing enhancers that are essential for TFAP2A expression and NCC development. Moreover, in NCC derived from patient speci ï¬c hiPSCs the inversion disconnects one TFAP2A allele from its cognate enhancers, leading to monoallelic and haploinsuf ï¬cient TFAP2A expression. Although the inversion shuf ï¬es within the same TAD the TFAP2A NCC enhancers with potentially novel target genes, this does not result in enhancer adoption. Our work illustrates the power of combining patient speciï¬c hiPSCs differentiation with different genomic and genetic engineering tools to overcome current limitations in unveiling the long range pathological consequences ofhuman structural variation.

We investigated neurodevelop mental processes impacted by the dosage changes of 16p11.2 CNV using cerebral organoid models. Materials and Methods: We generated 3D cultures (i.e. human cerebral organoids) that model human fetal brain development using iPSCs derived from skin ï¬broblasts of 16p11.2 deletion (DEL) and duplication (DUP) carriers. Transcriptome sequencing, proteomic pro ï¬ling and immu noï¬uorescence were carried out to investigate molecular and cellular impact of the 16p11.2 CNV. Cell migration, neuronal morphology and synaptogenesis were also investigated. Results: Cerebral organoid recapitulated macrocephaly and microcephaly phenotypes observed in 16p11.2 DEL and DUP carriers. Increased proliferation of neuropro genitor cells was observed in DELs. Gene co expression network analyses identi ï¬ed co expression modules that were strongly associated with 16p11.2 copy number status. A module enriched in genes with cell migration and loco motion functions was downregulated in DELs. A module enriched in genes with synaptic functions, was upregulatedin DELs. Severe migration defects in DEL organoids were conï¬rmed by Boyden chamber assay. Neurons derived from DEL organoids had longer neurites and increased soma size. The number of functional synapses was also higher in DEL organoids. Treatment with the RhoA inhibitor rhosin res cued cell migration defects. Conclusion: Cerebral organoids recapitulate patients head size phenotypes and gene expression pro ï¬les of fetal human brain. Genes associated with cell migration andsynaptic functions were dysregulated by the 16p11.2 CNV. These molecular ï¬ndings were validated experimentally and rescued by a small molecule inhibitor. L.

Here, we propose ASP RNAi as effective therapeutic option also for genetic disorders associated with gene/s duplication. As a proof of concept, we studied Autosomal Dominant adult onset demyelinating LeukoDystrophy (ADLD), a hereditary, progressive and fatal disorder caused by Lamin B1(LMNB1 ) duplication. We have identi ï¬ed three ASP siRNAs able to speci ï¬cally and effectively silence the non duplicated allele of LMNB1 , maintaining transcription ally active only two alleles as in healthy subjects, restoring its physiological mRNA/protein levels and ameliorating disease speci ï¬c cellular phenotypes in ADLD ï¬broblasts. To determine ASP silencing ef ï¬cacy in cell types more relevant to the disease, we generated neurons directly reprogrammed from human ï¬broblasts, and used rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) overexpressing the human LMNB1 . We initially proved that these cellular models presented ADLD speci ï¬c cellular phenotypes, supporting their relevance as in vitro preclinical tools. Then, we treated both cellular models with the selected most ef ï¬cient ASP siRNA at two different time points. The treatment reduced LMNB1 protein level and ameliorated ADLD speci ï¬c cellular abnormalities (e.g., nuclear anoma lies and neurite growth), further validating the therapeuticpotential of our RNA molecule and its allele speci ï¬city. Overall, we demonstrated that ASP RNAi is a suitable andpromising therapeutic option for ADLD, prompting further in vivo studies to validate our results before a clinical trial. Moreover, our results have a broad translational value since our strategy can be extended to all pathological conditions associated with gene copy number gain. E. Giorgio: None. M. Lorenzati: None.

We addressed individuals from the general population to explore interest in being informed if a cancer genetic investigation, revealing an increased cancer risk,had been conducted in their family. We also investigated preferences on source and mode of information. Materials and Methods: A random sample of the gen eral public was approached through a Swedish citizen web panel during October 2018. Respondents were given the scenarios of being member of a family with an increasedrisk of colorectal cancer (CRC), 10 and 70% lifetime risk, and being a potential at risk relative. Regular colonoscopy was presented as a preventive measure to individuals at risk. Results: Out of 1900 invited, 977 responded (51%). For the scenario of 10 and 70% CRC risk, 89.2 and 90.6% respectively, would like to receive information about theinvestigation. The proportion preferring to be informed was higher among women (91.5%, 93.3%) than men (85.7%,117088.2%), (Chi2, p ,0.044, p ,0.047). There was no sig niï¬cant difference by age, educational level, place of resi dence or parity. Regarding source of the information, 79.7 and 74.9% respectively would prefer to receive the information from health care and 16.9 and 19.1% from a family member.

Yet, little is known about how young adults and their families perceive andmanage these interactions. Materials and Methods: Analysis was based on family systems theory using a mixed method approach: familyinterviews (N ,68 individuals; 21 families), young adults interviews (N ,33), pedigree data and standardized measures. Results: Six key themes were identi ï¬ed and explored: 1) Responsibility to protect, 2) âItâs a woman âs problem â,3 )Family culture in ï¬uences communication, 4) Adversarial growth and connection, 5) Key events can be relational turning points, and 6) Health professionals can help. Family identities were solidi ï¬ed through the incorporation of a pathogenic variant in family scripts, while members of the family who held differing views to their families expressedless agreeableness and openness to disseminate information. The collective family âs experience and perspective towards a pathogenic variant can in ï¬uence a young adult âs decision making about genetic testing, risk management and family planning. The utilization of family therapy skills in routine practice would be helpful in facilitating communication andthe inclusion of standardized measures is bene ï¬cial to identify individuals needing ongoing psychological support.

Implementation of polygenic testing has begun, with severalcommercial laboratories now offering the test. Despite implementation, there is little research investigating how women respond and understand PRS. This study aimed toexplore women âs experience receiving their personalized breast cancer PRS and compare responses of women at different levels of polygenic risk. Methods: Eligible participants were affected and unaf fected women from families clinically assessed to be at high risk for breast cancer who had received their perso nalized PRS as part of the Variants in Practice Psychosocial Study (ViPPs). In depth semi structured interviews wereAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1171conducted up to four weeks after receiving PRS. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Twenty one women participated in this qualita tive study (mean age 53.4 years). Eleven women received a PRS that was in the top quartile of PRS distribution and 10in the lowest quartile. Women âs lived experience with breast cancer informed how they responded to their PRS, constructed and made sense of breast cancer risk followingreceipt of their PRS, and how they integrated this new information into their breast cancer risk management. Regardless of risk level, all participants demonstrated broadknowledge of concepts related to polygenic information and were able to accurately describe the implications of their PRS. Receiving PRS did not appear to negatively impactwomen âs distress levels. Conclusion: Polygenic breast cancer information is well received and understood by women at high risk for breastcancer. T.

Families and healthcare professionalscan face uncertainties regarding likely treatment outcomes and implications of genomic ï¬ndings. âPRISM Impact â assesses families âand healthcare professionals âexperiences with PRISM. Methods: Patients aged <21 years with a high risk cancer are eligible for PRISM. Parents, patients (>12 years), andhealthcare professionals opt in to PRISM Impact, complete surveys at enrolment, after results delivery, and then annually for ï¬ve years. We interview healthcare profes sionals annually. Results: Currently, 95 families have opted in and 76 parents (child âs mean age: 8.68 years [range ,0â17]; 67.1% mothers) have returned surveys. We have inter viewed 54 healthcare professionals (59% oncologists). Parents âexpectations of bene ï¬t vary widely, possibly due to feelings of uncertainty, with some reporting that their child isâextremely likely âto bene ï¬t (7.9%) while others report there is âno chance at all âof bene ï¬t (6.6%). This contrasts with healthcare professionals âexpectations, with only 18.5% of professionals ranking âcurrent patients âas the stakeholder bene ï¬tting most from PRISM. Parents âintol erance of uncertainty ranged from 12 â51 (out of 60) and parents âanxiety was high, on average 4.9 (SD ,2.99, range 0â10). Parents âintolerance of uncertainty and anxiety were highly correlated (r ,0.555, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Parents with higher intolerance of uncer tainty might be at greater risk of distress and may bene ï¬t from targeted psychosocial support.

However, little is yet known about the psychosocial and behavioural implications of MTP. The Molecular Screening and Therapeutics program is recruiting 1,000 patients with an advanced, solid, rare cancer toundertake MTP and, if an actionable variant is found, participate in a suitable therapeutic trial if available. The current mixed methods psychosocial sub study (PiGeOn)aims to explore participants âunderstanding, experiences and views regarding MTP at three timepoints. Baseline qualitative results are reported here. PiGeOn participantswere purposively sampled to participate in a semi structured interview. Thematic analysis is employed to determine themes. Data saturation was reached at 20 (aged 41 â77 years). Participants âmotivations include: fear of death, trust in their oncologist, need for control and a sense of ânothing lostâ. Desperation and fear of dying dominate motivation, but participants also value being able to help others. Participants tolerate uncertainty, hope for reduced prog nostic uncertainty, but fear loss of hope if no actionableresult is found (the most likely outcome). They often lack understanding, but trust the science of MTP and the research process. This is one of few studies to explore theexperiences of people who have undergone MTP. Identify ing new treatment options overshadows broader and familial implications of genetic testing in this population. This increases the dif ï¬culty of supporting informed consent and shared decision making in MTP testing. The current data will inform future policy and practice. Fundedby NHMRC. M. Best: None. P.

LFS is characterized by early onset, multiple primary malignancies with nearly 100% penetrance by age70 years, and substantial uncertainty regarding diagnostic timing and prognoses. An interdisciplinary team used Interpretive Description to analyze interviews with familygroups enrolled in the National Cancer Institute âs LFS study (NCT01443468). Interviews elicited narratives about cancer experiences, evolving family structure and functioning, andcoping. Families reported limited reprieve between cancer diag noses and deaths, which often occurred simultaneously andacross generations. Consequently, participants lived with grief as an integral feature of family life. Extensive disease related uncertainty created ambiguous losses , with little guidance to interpret risk or prepare for the next change. Family groups reported anticipatory losses , shared expec tations regarding predicted functional and emotional changeresulting from a new cancer or death. Individuals reported embodied loss , impairment to physical or aesthetic func tioning due to cancer treatment or prevention. Thesetypes of grief occurred simultaneously, often went unac knowledged , and were often neither recognized nor dis cussed with social or provider networks. Unacknowledgedlosses included survivor guilt, identity, hoped for life experiences, and altered reproductive plans. Family experiences with loss may warrant clinical atten tion over time, as opposed to solely at the time of diagnosis. Traditional medical teams may lack capacity to address the complex psychosocial needs of families grieving LFS related losses.
