100,Despite the availability of most of the human genome sequence the accu rate identification of genes on the DNA sequence remains to be continu ously improved and updated. This procedure relies on the combined useof a variety of tools including similarity searches and exon/gene predictionprograms. Similarity searches rely on a set of sequence data that has been increas ing very substantially and rapidly during the past months. These includehuman cDNAs mouse genomic DNA and cDNAs and puffer fish genomicsequences. With these resources the definition of a vertebrate set ofgenes is progressively approaching completion. The use of a compact vertebrate genome (the pufferfish Fugu rubripesand Tetraodon nigroviridis) in protein similarity searches has proven to beextremely valuable for the identification of mammalian coding sequences. DNA sequences representing in total 1.3 X coverage of the genome ofTetraodon nigroviridis were used in TBLASTX searches and enabled us todetect sequence matches in 75% of human genes with a backround offalse positive matches below 1%. These results will be compared to othersimilarity searches based on mouse genomic sequences that are activelybeing produced at present. These searches have been completed by BLASTN comparisons using aset of full length cDNA sequences and applied to human chromosome 22.Results of these analyses have been matched to the updated annotationof this chromosome that has been released recently and will be discussed. ,2001
101,The mechanisms whereby inherited DNA mutations cause disease areonly beginning to be understood. These are best understood in the contextof knowledge of the three dimensional structure of the relevant protein. Therefore to improve our understanding of the molecular basis of inherited diseases we have mapped the disease related mutations annotated in theOMIM database onto protein structural data when available. I will present a preliminary review of the relationship between proteinsequence structure function and disease highlighting specific examplesto illustrate our observations. ,2001
102,Missense mutations can knock out residues in proteins that are importantfor binding catalysis or conformational change or have subtle effects onstability or conformation. Because buried residues in proteins tend to beconserved and surface residues vary it is generally thought that surfaceresidues that are not directly involved in the function of proteins are unim portant especially regarding their effects on stability. But all residues inproteins make contributions to stability and structural integrity. Further thestability of proteins has not been optimised in evolution to the maximumvalue but proteins appear to have evolved to a stability that is sufficientlyadequate and to be consonant with other factors such as requirements fordegradation. Consequently some proteins are just on the verge of beingstable and are very susceptible to destabilising mutations. I will illustrate using p53 as an example how binding mutations can inactivate its functionby a variety of effects from altering residues essential for function to chang ing structure and stability. ,2001
103,The Genome Project has accelerated the availability of tools to apply phar macogenetics to the development of personalized medicines. This differsfrom the long term [10 15 year] strategy that is relatively familiar from dis ease gene identification to functional disease links to screenable targets toproducts. A near term [2 6 year] application of pharmacogenetics canaffect markets during the real time careers of current CEOs. Using wholegenome SNP maps to develop Medicine Response Profiles [MRP] foreither efficacy or adverse events it will be possible to test patients beforeprescriptions are filled to determine the right drug for the right patient. Proof of Principle experiments have demonstrated that SNP maps candefine linkage disequilibrium that can rapidly localize and identify suscep tibility disease genes. The application of linkage disequilibrium MRPs foridentifying individuals who are more susceptible for troublesome adverseeffects related to specific drug treatments will be presented as will thepotential effect on the competitive markets for those drugs. ,2001
104,Predictive genetic testing (PT) for Huntington Disease has now beenoffered for longer than for any other late onset genetic illness. The signifi cant number of persons at risk who have participated in testing nowallows insights to be derived that can be generalized for PT for HD world wide. Long term (5 year assessment) of the psychological effects of PThave revealed that patients receiving a decrease risk have improvement inwell being associated with less depression that is maintained for at least5 years after receiving results of PT. By contrast persons receiving anincreased risk result have an immediate increase in anxiety and depres sion followed within 6 months by improved in well being that is not sus tained. By 5 years these persons have no obvious change in psychologi cal profiles from that seen prior to receiving a predictive test result. Despitefears the incidence of catastrophic responses to PT has been low (lessthan 1%) and the concerns that persons at increased risk would have ahigh frequency of suicide has fortunately not been realized. The advent ofa direct genetic test for HD without requiring DNA from family relatives resulted in a significant increase in the acceptability of PT. At the presenttime in countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom approximate ly 10% of the number of persons estimated at risk have now participatedin PT programs. The advent of a genetic test for Huntington. Disease hasalso resulted in numerous new insights which include the recognition thatthere is a much higher mutation rate for HD than previously had been rec ognized that incomplete penetrance for HD is most frequent particularlyin the lower ranges of CAG repeats and that there is significant under ascertainment of persons with CAG repeats less than 40. While PT is gen erally been accepted there has been little demand for prenatal testing forHD. The involvement in large number of persons in PT programs togeth er with the advent of a genetic test for the diagnosis of HD has alsoallowed refinement of the relationship between CAG repeat length and ageof onset. Using the largest cohort of HD patients analyzed to date (involv ing 3500 patients from 39 centers on four continents) a model to accu rately predict probability of disease onset (with mean 95% confidence intervals of 1%) has been developed. Use of this survival model will allowfor the design of clinical trials which will significantly limit the number ofpersons necessary and therefore will reduce the cost as well as the dura tion of such a trial thus more quickly bringing such therapies into clinicalpractice. Affected families and professionals have worked together todevelop guidelines for PT which is likely to be a significant reason for thesuccessful integration of PT into the health care system in different parts ofthe world. ,2001
105,With the recent announcement of a rough draft of the human genomesequence came also the identification of between 1.4 and 2.1 millionSNPs from the private and public efforts. An interesting question iswhether these SNP databases contain the variants that underlie geneticsusceptibility to a variety of common complex diseases or are at least inlinkage disequilibrium with them and if so how to identify them. At presentit appears that testing such a large number of SNPs either in family basedor case control association studies is beyond the scope of existingresources so strategies need to be developed to prioritize the SNPs to betested. Considerable discussion has evolved around the issues of howmany and which SNPs are optimal what study designs should bePlenary Sessions 61employed and which populations should be studied. Attempts at answers to these questions can be obtained by considering the plausible geneticbasis for the diseases being studied as well as what is currently knownabout human evolution the characterization of genetic variation within andbetween human populations and the epidemiology of the diseases ofinterest. It is likely that no single strategy will be successful in all cases and that a broad perspective including a variety of approaches be main tained. ,2001
106,There is considerable debate about whether or not genetic associationanalysis based upon single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) will help deci pher the causative basis of complex disease states. Success will ulti mately depend upon the existence of common genomic sequence varia tions that have a significant disease predisposing effect upon cell/organ ism function. To add practical input to the theoretical debate a study shallbe presented that explores the feasibility of using association analysis tostudy non Mendelian Alzheimer s Disease (AD). For this investigation sev eral new research tools were developed and shall be described. Theseinclude the Human Genic Bi Allelic SEquences (HGBASE) SNP database(http //hgbase.cgr.ki.se) and the Dynamic Allele Specific Hybridization(DASH) genotyping method. The AD study was large scale compared to many contemporary efforts and designed to try to circumvent a number of typical pitfalls of associationanalysis such as i) disease heterogeneity ii) population stratification iii)identification of type I errors and iv) dependence upon LD (we tested prin cipally coding sequence and promoter SNPs). A total of 60 SNPs wereevaluated taken from candidate genes (N=55) from processes stronglyimplicated in neurodegenerative illness (oxidative stress andapoptosis/inflammation). We also included 13 variants previously claimedto show significant AD association. Upon completion of this investigation only two polymorphisms showed replicable disease association but thesesignals would not survive multiple test correction for 60 markers. None ofthe 13 prior candidates showed disease association. One of these tworeplicated signals entailed a promoter variation in a key apoptosis regula tor gene (TNFRSF6) and showed evidence for an interaction with APOEalleles. This implies for a role for apoptosis control in the causation of AD and may help explain the mechanism by which the E4 allele of APOEmediates an increased AD risk. Overall these empirical findings emphasize the doubtfulness of previouspositive findings and highlight the low success rates one should expect fortypical current investigations. Multiple testing study power and sample size issues are central to these problems. From this experience ways toimprove the execution of association studies in the future will be proposed. ,2001
107,One of the goals of the Human Genome Project is the systematic func tional analysis of genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of human disease. Due to the similarity in their genomes developmental pathwaysand physiology the mouse has become a major model to study the genet ics and pathogenesis of human diseases. An important tool to obtaininsight into the function of genes is the use of mutants. Mouse mutantshave occured spontaneously in breeding colonies or were chemicallyinduced. Mutants produced by gene targeting and transgenesis play anincreasing role in the dissection of biological pathways. The use of embry onic stem cells and homologous recombination allows a gene drivenanalysis of gene function. A prerequisite for this approach is the availabili ty of the gene(s) whose function is to be investigated. Equally importantand complementary is a phenotype driven approach in which as manymutants as possible are obtained with specific diseases or defects and theresponsible genes are then identified through positional cloning or otherstrategies. The validity and success of this approach was demonstrated inthe course of the genetic and molecular dissection on the pathway that setup the Drosophila body pattern. Although a large number of knockoutmutants will be produced in the coming years most of this mutants will beinsertions that interrupt gene function and in most cases produce null alle les. The full power of a genetic analysis of gene function however requires the availability of multiple alleles of the same gene or of the different genesinvolved in the pathogenesis of the same disease. This include hypo morphs alleles of different strength and gain of function alleles. Such alle les can be obtained after chemical mutagenesis with ENU which inducemainly point mutations. ENU is currently the most powerful mutagen for theproduction of mutants in mice and other species. We have set up a largescale ENU mutagenesis screen at the GSF Research Center. A core facil ity has been created in which mice are treated with ENU. Offspring of theG1 and G3 generation are then screened for dominant and recessive phe notypic abnormalities. Within the last 4 years we have screened more than20000 mice and isolated over 200 genetically confirmed new mousemutants. These include more than 60 mice with skeletal abnormalities andmany with obesity diabetes hypercholestolemia deafness B cell defi ciency or hyper IGE. Our goal is the production of a large number of newanimal models for the study of human disease. Future work will involve thecloning of the corresponding genes and the detailed phenotypic character ization of the mutants obtained. nan,2001
108,Chromosome analysis particularly in leukemia and lymphoma has had adramatic impact on cancer biology. In acute myelogenous leukemia leukemic cells with recurrent balanced translocations may have uniquephenotypes. Several hundred recurring translocations have been identifiedand the breakpoints of about half have been cloned. Cloning translocationbreakpoints has led to the identification of more than one hundred newgenes including BCL2 AML1 TEL PML and MLL. The mRNAs from the fusion genes are inframe and produce functional fusion mRNAs andunique translocation specific proteins. Cloning translocation breakpointshas provided unique diagnostic probes used for fluorescence in situhybridization or RT PCR. Specific therapies based on an understanding ofthe altered function of these fusion genes are now available and more willbe developed. We need to define the alterations in gene expression in these differenttranslocations using an unbiased genome wide strategy. This will permit amore sophisticated approach to identification of the genotype of each spe cific translocation. We used a modified SAGE (Serial Analysis of GeneExpression) technique to analyze normal CD34+ and CD15+ myeloid cells. We identified 42 399 and 37 519 unique tags from CD34+ and CD15+cells respectively. Comparing changes in gene expression betweenCD34+ and CD15+ cells 31 336 tags were absent and 20 054 new tagswere present in CD15+ cells. Information about the similarities as well as the differences in the pattern62 Plenary Sessionsof gene expression associated with each translocation will lead to a more precise understanding of the genetic differences induced by these fusiongenes in leukemia. Identifying the unique gene expression pattern for eachtranslocation will speed the development of a reliable cost efficient diag nostic DNA microarray. This will be critical as we treat each consistenttranslocation with its own genotype specific therapy. ,2001
109,Ideally the detection of a gene whose mutations contribute to cancershould lead to the development of a drug or procedure that cures or pre vents that cancer. So far this sequence of events has occurred extremelyrarely. A glimmer of hope is provided by the example of chronic myeloidleukemia (CML). Over 40 years ago a specific marker the Philadelphiachromosome was found. Over 25 years ago the Ph1 was found to becaused by a translocation. Over 10 years ago the translocation was foundto lead to the fusion of two genes creating a hyperactive tyrosine kinase. In a focused effort to provide an antidote to this kinase hundreds or thou sands of small molecule compounds were tested by a drug company. Aftermany years of endeavor the compound named STI 571 was identified thatappeared to have the desired effect. Today after some 3 years of clinicaltrials STI 571 appears to induce complete remission in almost everypatient with CML even at advanced stages of the disease. There mayeven be hope for cure. What lessons does this story teach us? First painstaking basic research is a prerequisite of any progress. This can bestbe done by academic researchers who are free to choose their projects. Second drug development requires enormous resources that are onlyavailable to the industry. Imagination discipline and hard core targeting isalso required. Third to get from gene discovery totherapy takes a longtime. Fourth the example shows that the scenario is possible. It shouldstart happening more often. My second example highlights the need of open mindedness and imagi nation. Another leukemia acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is often cur able today through the combined use of trans retinoic acid and chemother apy. The disease occurs as a result of the fusion of the APL gene with theretinoic acid receptor alpha gene. So one might think that the story resem bles that of CML the knowledge of the molecular event (in this case oneinterfering with the uptake of retinoic acid) hinting that treatment withretinoic acid might be useful. Not at all! Treatment of APL with retinoic acidpreceded the molecular genetic findings. It was part of Chinese folk medi cine! We learn again something that is hardly new in medicine. Imagina tion open mindedness and keen clinical observation are essential. Howabout the relatively recently detected genes that confer susceptibility tocommon cancers? BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been known for approxi mately 7 years. Their diagnostic implications are of course huge in affect ed families and testing for mutations probably leads to better risk aware ness and saved lives. Like in other cancers showing Mendelian inheri tance a major benefit is to those at risk family members who are found tobe mutation negative. But unfortunately the BRCA genes have not yet pro vided real breakthroughs in our understanding of pathogenetic mecha nisms. Curative non cytotoxic drugs are but a dream. Colorectal cancerlooks somewhat brighter. Here the mismatch repair defect caused bymutations in several genes occurs not only in the main Mendelian form ofcolorectal cancer (HNPCC) but also in a sizeable proportion (up to 20%) ofsporadic cancers. These mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancerpatients have a better prognosis than others. The basis of this phenome non is not yet understood however epigenetic phenomena (methylation loss of imprinting) seem to play a role. This gives hope that drugs and/orprocedures may be forthcoming that interfere with these cancers. Alreadymismatch repair deficiency as defined by microsatellite instability is a toolin the large scale molecular screening for HNPCC which in turn facilitateslife saving clinical surveillance. In summary the detection of cancer related genes is beginning to impactthe clinical handling of subsets of many cancers but the road from gene totherapy and prevention is slow and unpredictable. ,2001
110,The use of gene expression patterns to target and predict functional path ways is an important goal in the post sequence era. This lecture will pro vide a discussion of results from the investigation of both sporadic and hereditary cancers with the focused intent to integrate expression profilingwith mutation status and pathway prediction. Information from both biolog ic and mathematical studies will be described to address the consequenceof specific mutations on a cancer s gene expression profile. The resultssuggest the possibility for gene expression based identification (classifica tion) of mutation positive cancers as well as increased understanding ofthe functional consequences of gene mutations. ,2001
111,In the diagnosis of syndromes malformations of the skull and limbs fre quently occur in the same disorder. This suggests that similar molecularpathways are employed in development of these two evolutionarily distinctstructures. These parallels will be illustrated from work in my laboratory toelucidate the molecular basis of skull (craniosynostosis parietal foramina)and limb (syndactyly brachydactyly type B) malformations. These disor ders commonly show dominant inheritance and the causative genes that Iwill discuss encode proteins of two specific categories transcription factors(MSX2 ALX4 HOXD13 TWIST) and receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1 FGFR2 FGFR3 ROR2). Heterozygous loss of function mutations areassociated with abnormal phenotypes (haploinsufficiency) in the case of allfour transcription factors but none of the four receptor tyrosine kinases thisreflects the frequent dosage sensitivity of transcription factors compared tomost other proteins. In contrast diverse gain of function mechanisms(dominant positive or negative) are commonly encountered in receptortyrosine kinase mutations but more difficult to establish for transcriptionfactors although there is evidence for this type of mechanism in specificMSX2 and HOXD13 mutations. Homozygous mutations associated withcomplete loss of function are usually expected to be lethal however in thecase of ROR2 a distinct phenotype occurs recessive Robinow syndrome. Much remains to be learnt about how these proteins are integrated indevelopment but elements of a molecular pathway in the cranial sutureare beginning to emerge. ,2001
112,During mammalian development transcription of Hox genes is activated inpresomitic mesoderm with a time sequence that follows the order of thegenes along the chromosome. Consequently newly formed somites con tain specific combinations of HOX proteins that define their fates. I shalldiscuss the fact that Hoxd1 displays transitory stripes of expression withinpresomitic mesoderm but not in somites. Stabilization of its transcriptsthrough targeted modification uncovered sustained expression in somites reminiscent of other Hox gene patterns suggesting that cyclic activation inpresomitic mesoderm may be a general phenomenon masked by slowtranscript turnover. Accordingly in addition to Hoxd1 and Hoxd3 we showthat the promoters of both Hoxb1 and Hoxd11 transgenes can respond tothis regulation. We propose that colinearity is associated with bursts oftranscriptional activation of Hox genes every time a somite is about to form. This dynamic transcriptional behavior appears to depend upon Notch sig naling as mice deficient for the Su(H)/RBPJk/CBF1 gene the effector ofthe Notch pathway showed severely reduced Hoxd gene expression inpresomitic mesoderm. These results suggest a tight link between Hoxgene activation and the mechanisms behind the segmentation clock. Sucha linkage would coordinate the production of novel segments with theirmorphological specification. ,2001
113,These days genes may aspire to predicting the future but they are alsomessengers from the past. Each gene has its own separate history andhas made its own journey from the deep past to all of us in the present day. Interpreting the messages genes tell us about our ancestors and with itthe history of our species has changed. It has shifted from the accumula tion of summary statistics and the stale comparisons of one populationPlenary Sessions 63with another to the realisation that the history of our species is the history of individuals and their actions. The agents of change have been the uniparental loci found on mitochon drial DNA and the Y chromosome which trace the different histories of menand women. Robust phylogenies and accurate mutation rates introducethe fourth dimension of time into the interpretation of the patterns of genet ic variation. The presentation will be illustrated by examples ranging fromquestions on a global dimension to what can be said of the individualbehaviour and lives of our ancestors. ,2001
114,Genetic factors play a key role in host response disease severity and ulti mate outcome of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans. Using a mouse model of susceptibility to Mycobacterial infections we haveisolated the Nramp1 gene by positional cloning. Loss of function mutations at Nramp1 in mice cause susceptibility to infection with unrelated intracel lular parasites by impairing macrophage function. Recently it was shownthat polymorphic variants at the human NRAMP1 gene are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis and leprosy in certain endemic areas of dis ease. The Nramp1 protein is expressed in macrophages and neutrophils ina subcellular compartment that is rapidly recruited to the membrane of thephagosome soon after phagocytosis of inert particles or live bacteria. Recruitment of Nramp1 to the phagosomal membrane interferes with theability of intracellular parasites to inhibit phagolysosome formation. Micro fluorescence imaging in intact cells of single phagosomes containing par ticles labeled with metal sensitive fluorescent dyes demonstrate thatNramp1 protein functions as a pH dependent divalent cation efflux pump. To identify additional genes responsible for differences in host response toMycobacterial infections ninety five animals of an informative F2 crossderived from highly susceptible DBA/2J and resistant C57Bl/6J parents were infected intravenously with M. tuberculosis (1 X 10 5CFU) and dura tion of survival was used as a quantitative phenotypic measure of suscep tibility in a whole genome scan. Quantitative trait locus analysis (QTL)showed that the genetically controlled susceptibility was multigenic. QTLanalysis identified two significant linkages on the distal portion of chromo some 1 (LOD 4.80) and on the proximal portion of chromosome 7 (LOD 4.66) that each account for approximately 21% of the phenotypic variance. A third suggestive linkage was identified on the proximal portion of chro mosome 3 (LOD 3.93 additional 18% of the variance). At each locus homozygosity for the parental C57Bl/6J alleles was associated withincreased resistance to infection. The role of these three loci in regulatingM. tuberculosis replication in the lungs is currently being validated in addi tional experiments using aerosol infection and using bacterial replicationas a quantitative trait. Such novel mouse loci provide the basis for evalu ating a possible association of the corresponding syntenic chromosomalregions in humans with susceptibility to tuberculosis. ,2001
115,Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) following in vitro fertilization (IVF) cleavage stage embryo biopsy and single cell genetic analysis hasbecome increasingly established over the last ten years as a viable alter native to conventional prenatal diagnosis for both chromosomal and singlegene defects (Handyside and Delhanty 1997). The first pregnancies wereestablished in 1989 in a series of couples at risk of various X linked reces sive diseases by identifying (unaffected or carrier) female embryos fortransfer (Handyside et al. 1990). Towards the end of 1999 the EuropeanSociety for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) PGD Consor tium reported the first detailed clinical data from 16 centres for 392 cyclescompleted in the period January 1997 to September 1998 (Geraedts et al. 1999). The overall clinical pregnancy rate for this series was 17% peroocyte retrieval or 22% per embryo transfer and data from 82 pregnanciesand 79 children was collected. In the latest data covering a period from1994 to May 2000 1319 cycles from 25 centres are reported with thesame overall pregnancy rate together with the details of 163 pregnanciesand 162 children (Geraedts et al. 2000). The current status of PGD will bebriefly reviewed together with prospects for future developments. Geraedts J. Handyside A. Harper J. Liebaers I. Sermon K. Staessen C. Thornhill A.

116,We now know the sequence of DNA within the human genome. However this linear information is an incomplete description of our genetic informa tion. Many levels of chromatin structure are involved in regulating geneexpression in a heritable (epigenetic) manner. Recently attention hasturned to the spatial organisation and functional compartmentalisation ofchromosomes and of the nucleus itself in the quest to understand how theexpression of complex genomes is regulated. I will present evidence that individual human chromosomes occupy specif ic positions within the nucleus in both fixed and living cells. Gene richhuman chromosomes general localise towards the interior of the nucleuswhereas gene poor chromosomes are positioned towards the edge of thenucleus. Chromosome positioning in relation to cell cycle changes and tocertain disease states will be discussed. Relationships between nuclearorganisation and the occurrence of chromosome rearrangements in thehuman population will also be examined. Evidence from model organisms suggests that the nuclear organisation ofindividual genes can be important in their regulation. I will present our stud ies that begin to reveal the nuclear organisation of genes from differentparts of the human genome. I will show that individual genes occupy pre ferred sites within interphase chromosome territories but that some genesappear to occupy positions within the nucleus that are quite distinct formthe space taken up by the rest of the chromosome to which they belong.

117,Similarities in the prenatal development of the mouse and human CNShave allowed for extensive extrapolation between species and a rapidlyincreasing understanding of factors involved in both normal and abnormaldevelopment. Of particular interest for this review are the formation andclosure of the neural tube events that occur during the third and fourthweeks of human embryogenesis. Neural tube closure is initiated at similardevelopmental stages in the mouse and human but its progression differs. In the mouse there is an intermittent anterior closure site at the mid brain/hindbrain junction while humans lack this intermittent site. This hassignificant implications relative to our interpretation of the genesis ofhuman neural tube defects. Research utilizing mice has helped to reveal key cell populations andmechanisms that are involved in the genesis of neural tube defects as wellas other CNS abnormalities including holoprosencephaly and hydro cephaly. Additionally a range of causative environmental genetic andmultifactorial insults have been examined that are relevant not only tomajor CNS malformations but also behavioral abnormalities. For example ethanol which is the most common nonhereditary cause of mental retar dation kills selective cell populations in the neural plate and early neuraltube. The pattern of apoptosis resulting from acute ethanol exposure is readilyrelated to failure of the neural tube to close deficiencies in the forebrainmidline and also to subsequent hindbrain abnormalities. Ethanol also killsselected CNS populations at fetal and perinatal stages of development. Another condition cholesterol deficiency as underlies the human mentalretardation/malformation syndrome Smith Lemli Opitz (SLO) also cancause selective cellular loss. This selective vulnerability appears to berelated at least in part to a signaling pathway involving sonic hedgehogand the involvement of cholesterol in hedgehog protein function. Both Shh gene knockout and selective modification of the gene that ismutated in SLO are examples that will be presented to illustrate the utilityof mouse models for the exploration of normal and abnormal CNS devel opment.

118,Mental retardation (MR) is a significant medical problem affecting ~2 3% ofgeneral population. MR is not a single disorder rather it is a large (genet ically and clinically) heterogeneous group of disorders with a range ofseverity and associated dysmorphology. When the prevalence of MRbetween the two sexes (males and females) is compared the excess ofmales over females at both ends of the normal IQ distribution is apparent. The existence of these differences in variance of IQ between males andfemales (males show consistently higher variance than females) was ofteninterpreted as supporting evidence for the higher density of genes for men tal retardation on the human X chromosome. This issue still remains con troversial. X linked mental retardation or XLMR is frequent with an estimated preva lence of 1.66/1000 males. Mental retardation can be a component of a syn drome metabolic disorder or neuromuscular disorder or MR can be anexclusive phenotype affecting only the development of cognitive function. There are numerous (>210) mental retardation entries in OMIM (syndromicand non specific) associated with the human X chromosome. AutosomalMR is much less characterised especially the non specific forms. Currently there are 33 known XLMR genes. The majority of these aregenes for syndromic types of XLMR (eg. fragile X syndrome FMR1 alpha thalassemia mental retardation syndrome ATRX etc.). The number ofgenes for non specific X linked mental retardation (MRX genes) has grownrapidly over the past three years. There are now at least eight such genesrecognised. Based on currently available clinical and molecular data werecently estimated the minimum number of MRX genes to be approxi mately 22. Some lumping of syndromic and non specific phenotypes as a conse quence of different disease causing mutations in the same gene (eg. ATRX RPS6KA3 and MECP2 genes) may reduce the overall number ofXLMR genes. The scenario of many genes affecting normal development of cognitivefunction (eg. MRX genes) is appearing. A large proportion of idiopathic MRremains undiagnosed as a consequence of either the current inability todevise and carry out large scale tests or the existence of as yet undiscov ered cause(s) of MR. This represents a great challenge for future applica tions of large scale genomics approaches like DNA chip and microarraytechnologies in particular. ,2001
119,The completion of the human genome project has revealed a surprisinglow number of predicted genes. One of the consequences of this modestnumber is that we have to look carefully for mechanisms that would gen erate the complexity intrinsic to human development and homeostasis. One of these mechanisms at the transcriptome level is alternative splicing. One of the most common forms of alternative splicing is alternative exonusage where exons can be spliced out or skipped which generates a pat tern of exon usage. In my talk I will discuss results from an extensive analy sis of alternative exon usage within the human transcriptome. Our approach was centered in three aspects mapping of all human cDNAinformation onto the draft of the human genome a genome based cluster ing of the cDNA information and the generation of a binary matrix repre senting all the variation found for each cDNA cluster. The results from this analysis show that alternative exon usage occurs inmore than 40% of known human genes. We have also been able to iden tify more than 100 000 variants. I will discuss several other aspects of thisanalysis including tissue distribution of variants and functional annotation. ,2001
120,The analysis of gene expression data generated with DNA microarraysposes major computational challenges. In this talk we will review the nec essary steps in processing such data. Image analysis is used to collectintensities which then have to be normalized in order to determine ratiosof change between mRNA abundancies under different conditions. Givenresults from many hybridizations genes or conditions are grouped togeth er by similarity using clustering algorithms. Additional knowledge about theconditions e.g. tumor types pose the problem of identifying characteristicfeatures in the expression data that are associated with the those types. For several of these steps we will also suggest novel approaches and giveexamples of their application. ,2001
121,Genetic and molecular genetic analyses of the Drosophila circadian sys tem originally identified the period protein as a clock molecule that con tributes to circadian pacemaker function. The gene shows robust circadianrhythms of transcription mRNA and protein expression with strong evi dence in favor of autoregulation. This raised the hypothesis that transcrip tion and macromolecular metabolism a transcription translation feedbackloop was central to the mechanism(s) that generated circadian rhythms. This model is still viable today and transcriptional regulation plays a promi nent role in contemporary circadian studies. Subsequent work identified atleast seven new Drosophila clock genes tim Clock cycle doubletime cry pdf and vrille. There is now a good picture of what these different gene products do and how they collaborate during the 24 hr cycle. Most if not allof these genes have mammalian orthologs which function in a very simi lar manner in mice. Therefore the transcription translation feedback loophypothesis also appears to be central to mammalian clocks. Moreover arecent human sleep disorder family has been described with a mutation ina human period gene protein. Despite all of this substantial recentConcurrent Symposia 65progress there are a large number of questions that remain unanswered. Prominent among these are how 24 hr timing is achieved and why theapparent differences in cryptochrome (cry) function between flies and mammals. New features of these and other issues will also be discussed. Finally some evolutionary issues will be considered in an attempt to pro vide a framework for considering together different circadian systems ,2001
122,The thalassaemias are the commonest monogenic diseases. As the coun tries in the developing world go through the demographic transitiontowards improved living conditions many babies with these diseases who hitherto would have died are now surviving. Recent studies have con firmed the long held belief that these conditions have reached their highgene frequency by natural selection acting on local mutations. These dis orders have remarkably diverse phenotypes and it is now clear that thisresults from the action of a number of primary secondary and tertiarygenetic modifiers together with major environmental effects. Thus these diseases offer a model system for understanding the phenotypic diversityof monogenic disease for underlining the problems that will be encoun tered when attempting to analyse multifactorial diseases and for the appli cation of the tools of molecular genetics to the problems of the developingcountries. ,2001
123,The genetically distinct populations of South Africa provide valuable infor mation for molecular research. Only a small fraction of the sequencechanges that arose in Africa has spread to Europe and other countries. Theindigenous Khoisan people and African Negro slaves contributed to theunique gene pool of the white Afrikaner population (~3 million) that origi nated from approximately 2000 settlers who emigrated from Holland Ger many and France in the late 17th and early 18th centuries with a lesserincrement from England in the 19th century. This group provides an excel lent example of founder events in human evolution. The origin of theColoured population of South Africa can be traced back to 1652 whenmarriages between European colonists and the two indigenous popula tions the Khoi and the San occurred relatively frequently. An additionalgene flow to this gene pool came from the Indian traders and slaves fromEast Africa and Madagascar who were either completely Negroid orNegroid with Malay or Indonesian admixture. The high prevalence of several genetic diseases in the Afrikaner popula tion resulted from a reduction in genetic variability due to geographic iso lation and religious/cultural bonds coupled to rapid population expansionover 10 12 generations. This was confirmed by molecular analysis of dis eases such as familial hypercholesterolaemia variegate porphyria andhereditary haemochromatosis. These studies illustrated the importance ofgenetic factors underlying population/ethnic differences in disease risk anddefined the recently admixed Coloured population as a valuable candidatepopulation for the identification of genes/mutations underlying complex dis eases. This population is currently studied extensively in an attempt toidentify genetic factors associated with hypertension or modified risk of HIVinfection and progression to AIDS. Information gained through the analysisof disease profiles in the African context has contributed to our under standing of why certain diseases affect different populations at differentrates. ,2001
124,The Jews are a people of Middle Eastern origin who have retained theirreligious and genetic identity over 2000 years of Diaspora. Estimates ofhistorical admixture are as low as 0.5% per generation suggesting thatJews remained endogamous. During the Diaspora Jews established geo graphically dispersed communities in Central and Eastern Europe (Ashke nazim) North Africa the Balkans and the Levant (Sephardim) Iran andIraq Uzbekistan Yemen and the Gulf states and Italy as well as else where. Many Mendelian genetic conditions have been identified withinthese Jewish groups that share the feature of having founder mutationswith heterozygote frequencies that exceed 1%. Mutations for some ofthese conditions such as Tay Sachs disease Bloom syndrome familialdysautonomia phenylketonuria and oculopharngeal muscular dystrophy are found exclusively within certain Diapora groups and must have arisenduring a period of relatively recent geographic isolation. Mutations for otherconditions such as familial Mediterranean fever cystic fibrosis GJB166 Concurrent Symposiadeafness and Gaucher disease are shared between Jewish groups and non Jewish groups of the Mediterranean basin suggesting a more ancientorigin. Mutations in the BRCA1 and Factor XI genes common to Ashkenaziand Iraqi Jews are likely to have arisen among the Jews of ancient Pales tine in pre Diaspora times. The observed intervals of linkage disequilibriumfor these conditions tend to correlate inversely with the postulated dates oforigin of the founder mutations. The presence of so many founder muta tions facilitates genetic testing including heterozygote screening for auto somal recessive conditions. For Ashkenazi Jews multiplex heterozygotescreening for 10 autosomal recessive conditions is now practical. Con versely the observation of founder mutations occurring in linkage disequi lbrium intervals that may span up to 7 cM suggests that association stud ies using genetic markers in linkage disequilibirum may facilitate discoveryfor new disease genes. ,2001
125,The enormous advances in science and technology in the XX Centuryhave facilitated the process of globalization with the aim of a better qualityof life for all. Paradoxically the gap between the rich and the poor eitherbetween nations or persons is constantly widening. Consequently theaccess to health care and education among other benefits is everydaymore limited for the poor. The actual trends in human genome research areleading towards a promising genomic medicine which will be expensiveand inaccesible for many since the private funding for R&D have at leastdoubled the public ones in the last few years with the consequent bias infocusing on high prevalence disorders in G7 populations and neglectingthe diseases of the poor. The abysmal investment differences in R&Dbetween developed and developing countries (for instance the 2.7% of theGNP in the USA versus the 0.4 % in M xico) is progresively increasing soit is not only difficult to keep the pace in research but also in the transfer oftechnology. In an attempt to optimize the scarce human and material med ical genetic resources in M xico an initiative of a network using internet asa means of communication and information has been created. The Mexi can Network of Molecular Biomedicine aims to provide a program basedon cooperation high quality service and patient care. Initial steps havesucceded in the organization of a National Hemophilia Center for themolecular diagnosis of patients and possible carriers. The principles of ourexperience should be aplicable to any developing country. Nevertheless although medicine has traditionally been viewed as a humane activityguided by altruism the second half of the XX Century has seen it trans formed into a profitable business with an inevitable greed. We need torecuperate the escence of Medicine so any health care system be basedon a spirit of justice equality and above all on compassion. ,2001
126,GeneTests (www.genetests.org) was established in 1993 with funding fromthe NIH to help geneticists identify clinical and research laboratories pro viding DNA based testing for inherited diseases. GeneTests currently iscomprised of a database of tests for ~800 inherited diseases a directoryof ~480 international genetics laboratories a directory of over 900 USgenetics clinics educational materials on basic concepts in genetic coun seling and testing and PowerPointÃÂ¦ teaching tools. GeneClinics(www.geneclinics.org) was established in 1997 to provide geneticists withinformation on test usage in diagnosis management and genetic counsel ing for specific inherited disorders. GeneClinics is comprised of over 100expert authored peer reviewed disease profiles that link to genomic data bases custom Medline searches selected patient resources and policystatements of the ASHG ACMG and NSGC. Each day GeneTests issearched ~750 times and GeneClinics ~2500 times. Through theGeneTests registration system Website user logs and direct user feed back we have documented over time the expanding international scopeand broadening audience of these resources. The laboratory directory hasbecome increasingly international as researchers and clinical laboratorieshave come to depend on worldwide ascertainment of patients with rareinherited disorders. Patients empowered by the consumer health move ment gather information to partner with their healthcare providers in med ical decision making. Educators have required students to use GeneTestsand GeneClinics in case based problem solving in policy making labora tory medicine and patient care. With the completion of the draft humangenome sequence and the introduction of the revolutionary social and medical concepts of predictive and predispositional testing the media reg ularly seeks aggregate information on genetic test availability and use. Asgenetic testing moves into mainstream medicine US governmental agen cies rely on centralized sources of genetic test data as they institute regu lation of tests and more regulation of laboratories. ,2001
127,The X ray was the only technique used for antenatal diagnosis prior to the1960 s. The introduction of Ultrasound [1970 s] and MRI [1980 s] improved the accuracy of diagnosis. The other non invasive techniques developedinclude maternal serum studies and the study of foetal red cells in mater nal blood[1990Ã¢\x80\x98s].Invasive procedures like Amniotic Fluid Cell Cultures [1960Ã¢\x80\x98s] ChorionicVilli Biopsies [1970Ã¢\x80\x98s] Cordocentesis Fetoscopy Embryoscopy Amniog raphy and various other Biopsy techniques [1980Ã¢\x80\x98s] has further improvedthe prospects of diagnosis of foetal abnormalities and has added to theexisting tests consisting principally of Chromosomal Analysis Biochemicaltests and Molecular methods. The introduction of Preimplantation Diagno sis in the1990Ã¢\x80\x98s has helped to identify diseases and to select normalembryos. India is a developing country and is trying to keep pace with theseadvances. While the non invasive techniques except fetal cells in mater nal blood are practiced most often Chorionic Villi Biopsy Placental Biop sy Amniotic Fluid Cell Culture Cordocentesis and other biopsies areundertaken less often. The tests on the material so obtained consist main ly of Chromosomal Analysis a few biochemical tests and even fewer Mol ecular [DNA] tests which are being mainly done for Deuchenne MuscularDystrophy and Hereditary Anemias [Thalassemia Sickle Cell Anemia andHemophilia]. These tests are available principally in urban based private non governmental institutions and research centers. These are therefore not available to the vast majority of the population. Preimplantation diag nosis in India is however only being attempted in animals. Antenatal diagnosis for sexing was started in 1978 and this led to femalefoeticide. Female foeticide exists because of Ã¢\x80\x98dowryÃ¢\x80\x98 system. This Ã¢\x80\x98dowryÃ¢\x80\x98 system is practiced in many areas of India wherein money and valuablesare given to the groom or his family mostly on demand during marriage. Although there is a law forbidding it and making it a criminal act like theAntenatal Diagnosis Misuse Act of 1996 [which forbids sexing except for X linked diseases] it is very difficult to implement these two laws as there areno complainants. In order to assess the exact status of antenatal diagnosis in India a ques tionnaire is being sent to various institutions. The results of these replieswill be compiled and presented. ,2001
128,"Recently fetal DNA has been shown to be present in maternal plasma andserum. Using quantitative PCR techniques fetal DNA in maternal plasmaand serum has been demonstrated to be present in amounts which areeasily detectable. This new source of fetal genetic material offers a power ful approach for the prenatal diagnosis of many fetal genetic characteris tics including blood group status and many paternally inherited genetictraits. Diseases causing mutations which have been detected in maternalplasma include myotonic dystrophy and achondroplasia. The finding thatpart of the fetal DNA in maternal plasma exists as intact fetal cells alsooffers new possibilities for the prenatal diagnosis of many chromosomalaneuploidies including trisomy 21. Quantitative abnormalities of fetal DNAin maternal plasma and serum have also been found in many disorders including pre eclampsia preterm labour and fetal chromosomal aneuploi dies. These results suggest that fetal DNA measurement may become auseful tool for the detection or monitoring of these disorders. Apart from itsdiagnostic implications circulating fetal DNA also opens up many previ ously unexplored research opportunities for understanding the fetomater nal relationship on a molecular level. Concurrent Symposia 67S19. Chromatin cell cycle and ÃÂ§ globin gene transcription F. Grosveld Dept. of Cell Biology and Genetics Erasmus University Rotterdam Rot terdam The N', 'The Locus Control Region (LCR) is required for the activation of all of thehuman beta like globin genes during development. The early embryonicdevelopmental programme is executed in nucleated primitive red bloodcells that express the epsilon and gamma genes. The foetal/adult pro gramme takes place in a definitive red blood cells that first express thegamma and later the delta and beta genes. This difference in expressionprogramme correlates with changes in the chromatin structure within thebeta globin locus. Repression of the early genes (epsilon and gamma) inlate cells is achieved by as yet unknown factors acting on sequences flank ing these genes. Superimposed on this is a mechanism in which the earlygenes (epsilon and gamma) suppress the late genes (delta and beta) bycompetition for the interaction with the LCR. In particular the latter mecha nism has allowed a series of studies to examine the transcriptional processat the level of the single cell. These studies indicate that the LCR interactswith individual globin genes and that LCR/gene interactions are dynamicwith complexes forming and dissociating continually. The levels of expres sion of each of the genes appear to depend on (1) the frequency of inter action which is itself dependent on the distance of the gene to the LCR (2)the affinity/stability of the LCR/gene complexwhich is dependent on thebalance of transcription factors such as EKLF. When individual hypersen sitive region in the LCR are deleted from a complete transgenic locus thatis integrated in a pericentromeric region the locus becomes sensitive totwo types of position effects. One of these is classical Position Effect Varia gation (PEV) while the other is a Timing Position Effect (TPE). The PEVcan be modified by an increase in the concentration of EKLF which acts onthe LCR and results in more cells expressing the locus which is accom panied by a general increase in DNAse sensitivity throughout the locus. TPE is dependent on the cell cycle resulting in a limited period of expres sion in of all the red cells. Examination of single cells shows that both typesof position effects involve the relocalisation of the transgenic locus in thenucleus. The implications of these experiments for the role of the LCR inthe activation of the locus will be discussed. ",2001
129,H19 and the oppositely imprinted Igf2gene are located 90 kb apart in mouse and share regulatory elements crucial to their imprinting. It is of par ticular interest to determine how and when the imprint that distinguishesthese two alleles is determined. Two epigenetic modifications DNA methy lation and chromatin structure are proposed to confer the allelic mark. Specifically H19 is hypermethylated on the inactive paternal allele in a 2 kb region 2 kb 5 to the start of transcription (this region is designated atthe DMD or differentially methylated domain). This same region is hyper sensitive to nucleases on the active maternal allele. Thus it has been pro posed that the DMD confers the allelic mark. To test this hypothesis theDMD was deleted from the endogenous locus in mice. In the absence ofthe DMD imprinted expression of H19 and Igf2was perturbed on both parental alleles on the paternal allele transcription from the normally silentH19 allele was activated and Igf2transcription was coordinately reduced whereas on the mutant maternal allele Igf2expression was activated and H19 expression was coordinately reduced. These experiments prove that the DMD is required for imprinted expression on both parental chromo somes. It has been postulated that the DMD acts as a methylation sensi tive boundary element that isolates H19 and the enhancers on the mater nal chromosome thereby preventing access of Igf2to the enhancers. On the paternal chromosome Igf2is expressed because the DMD and H19 gene promoter are methylated preventing the boundary proteins frombinding and H19from being expressed. It was recently demonstrated that a putative boundary protein CTCF binds to a conserved repetitive elementin the DMD in a methylation senstive manner. While these experimentswere performed in vitro we are testing the role of CTCF and the conserved DMD elements in vivo . ,2001
130,The limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) are a heterogeneous groupof disorders which comprise both autosomal dominant and recessive dis eases. A gene and protein based classification for these conditions is nowpossible based on their underlying molecular pathology. Amongst theautosomal dominant forms of LGMD mutations in the genes encodingmyotilin (a component of the muscle sarcomere) caveolin 3 (a componentof caveolae in the muscle fibre membrane) and lamin A/C a nuclear enve lope protein have been described while mutations in the collagen VI genesaccount for a phenotypically overlapping condition Bethlem myopathy. Amongst the autosomal recessive types of LGMD an important subgroupis caused by mutations in the genes encoding a b g and d sarcoglycan proteins which with dystrophin form a complex of structural proteins in themuscle fibre membrane. The diseases of the dystrophin associated com plex share some clinical and pathological similarities though the mecha nisms by which these diseases arise may in some ways be subtly different. The other recognised forms of autosomal recessive LGMD are morediverse mutations in calpain 3 a protease predominantly expressed inskeletal muscle cause a relatively common type of LGMD while mutationsin dysferlin a membrane protein which contains multiple C2 domainscause a form of muscular dystrophy which may present either with pre dominantly proximal or distal disease. The latest gene identified as caus ing an autosomal recessive LGMD telethonin is a component of the mus cle sarcomere. With these diverse disease mechanisms it is likely that a number of dis ease pathways can contribute to the causation of these diseases. In themeantime improvements in the classification of this group have resulted inclear benefits to patients in terms of diagnosis and the provision of prog nostic and genetic counselling information. ,2001
131,The autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophies (AR LGMD)and autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)have been the subject of world wide investigation. Nine AR LGMD (LGMD2A to LGMD2I) genes have been mapped and link age analysis indicates that there is further genetic heterogeneity . The clin 68 Concurrent Symposiaical course is characterised by great variability ranging from severe forms with early onset and rapid progression to milder forms with later onset. Thegene product is known for 7 forms calpain 3 for LGMD2A dysferlin forLGMD2B alpha sarcoglycan for LGMD2D beta sarcoglycan forLGMD2E gamma sarcoglycan for LGMD2C delta sarcoglycan forLGMD2F and the sarcomeric protein telethonin for LGMD2G. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD1) mapped at 4q35 accounts for most cases of FSHD. Affected patients have a deletion of acritical number of 3.3kb repeated units at D4Z4. The most likely hypothe sis to explain the abnormal phenotype is a position effect. We performed genotype phenotype correlation studies in 216 LGMDpatients classified from calpainopathy to telethoninopathy as well as 248FSHD1 patients. In the LGMD group a similar clinical course amongpatients with non allelic mutations while a discordant phenotype in patientscarrying the same mutation was observed. For FHSD1 in addition to thegreat intra and interfamilial variability a significantly greater proportion ofaffected males than females (due to a higher proportion of asymptomaticwomen carrying a small EcoRI fragment < 35kb) was observed. Understanding how patients with the same mutation may have a discor dant phenotype or why a greater proportion of women may be more pro tected from the deleterious effect of the FSHD1 mutation remains a majorchallenge. It will depend on future knowledge on gene protein functions onprotein interactions and on identifying modifying genes and other factorsunderlying clinical variability.

132,Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the third neuromus cular disease with a prevalence of 1/25.000 in most populations. Thesequence of muscle involvement the high intra and interfamilial clinicalvariability and lack of treatment have stimulated search for the molecularbackground of this syndrome. Being an autosomal dominant phenotype agenome wide marker scan allowed mapping of the FSHD1 locus to #4q. The causative mutation in familial and sporadic cases turned out to be adeletion within a polymorphic repeat array only some 25 kb from the telom ere. The molecular dissection of FSHD has been compromised but alsostimulated by the extensive chromosomal dispersion of this region. Thehighly homologous locus on 10q has been particularly rewarding. In up to20% of the population an exchange between the subtelomeric regions of#4q and #10q can be observed. The presence of a supernumerary #4 typerepeat on #10 seems to induce #4 instability. In most sporadic patients asomatic mutation can be detected in either the patient or one of the par ents. The detailed physical information on the 4q and 10q regions hasimproved the diagnostic repertoire. However the molecular mechanism ofFSHD remains elusive. The present prevailing model is that the FSHDmutation/deletion induces a change in the chromatin structure and accord ingly the expression of genes in the region basically according to positioneffect variegation. Several candidate genes have been identified in theregion FRG1 FRG2 TUBB4q and DUX4 all being localized within 100 kbof the D4Z4 repeat array. Implementation of various genomics approachesand (transgenic) animal models will be instrumental to reveal the molecu lar pathways necessary to open the FSHD Pandora box. *On behalf of the Dutch FSHD Team. ,2001
133,At the centre of the nature nurture debate has been general cognitive abil ity ( g ) often called intelligence. Decades of genetic research comparingidentical and non identical twins and adoption studies consistently showsubstantial genetic influence on cognitive abilities such as verbal and spa tial abilities and on cognitive disabilities such as reading disability anddementia. Genetic research on g has now gone beyond simply demon strating genetic influence to ask questions about development about rela tions between cognitive abilities and about the environment. A surprisingdevelopmental finding is that genetic influence on g increases steadilyduring the life span. Concerning relations between cognitive abilities genetic research has shown that the same genetic factors influencediverse cognitive abilities suggesting that g is the genetic core of cogni tive abilities. Research at the interface between nature and nurture showsthat environmental factors that influence the development of g work verydifferently from the way we thought they worked. An exciting new direction for genetic research is to identify some of the many genes that affect cognitive abilities and disabilities. We have con ducted an initial scan of the genome using DNA pooling with two thousandDNA markers in order to find genes associated with g . Scientific andsocial implications of finding genes for g will be discussed. Both nature and nurture are important for the development of g . Thenature nurture wars are over For nearly all complex medical and behav ioral traits genetic factors are important but so too are environmental fac tors. Moreover genetic and environmental factors interact and correlate. The issue is not nature versus nurture but rather nature andnurture. ,2001
134,Several behavioral genetic methods exist for studying human disease inanimals. Mouse methods include special populations relevant for genemapping such as recombinant inbred strains genetically segregating pop ulations congenic strains and short term selected lines as well as otherpopulations critical for disease phenotype analyses such as long termselected lines panels of standard inbred strains transgenic lines andknockout mice. All of these methods have been used to study voluntaryalcohol intake in mice a model thought to be relevant to human alcoholself administration ultimately associated with the development of alcoholabuse. Some of these methods have also been brought to bear on anoth er common effect of abused drugs locomotor stimulation. This motivation ally relevant behavior has been described as a putative model of humandrug induced euphoria. Gene mapping efforts have produced convergentdata indicating that genes on chromosomes 2 3 and 9 influence voluntaryalcohol intake. The region of interest on chromosome 9 harbors at leasttwo interesting candidate genes the dopamine D2 receptor gene Drd2and the serotonin 1B receptor gene Htr1b. Genes influencing locomotorstimulant responses to several abused drugs including cocaine metham phetamine and ethanol (alcohol) have been provisionally mapped. Themost definitive information has been gathered for ethanol for which astrong association with a region on chromosome 2 has been found. Phar macological studies in lines of mice bidirectionally selectively bred forextreme sensitivity (FAST) and insensitivity (SLOW) to ethanol s locomotorstimulant effects are another powerful tool for identifying the neurobiologi cal determinants of alcohol sensitivity. Recent data in our lab suggests thatgamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and in particular GABA B type recep tors in the ventral tegmental area significantly influence ethanol s stimulanteffects. Future efforts will be directed at further refinement of the biologicalcircuitry and genetic regions associated with these important alcohol asso ciated traits. The ultimate goals will be identification of the several influen tial genes and discovery of the central structures and the component parts(e.g. cell types neurotransmitters receptor types) that modulate thesetraits. ,2001
135,Having previously shown a positive association between the (TCAT)nmicrosatellite HUMTH01 located in the first intron of the Tyrosine Hydrox ylase (TH) gene with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well as withdisturbances in the catecholamine metabolism we thereafter establishedthat the alleles of this tetranucleotide repeat activate transcription driven bya minimal promoter. In addition they are specifically recognized by nuclearproteins pertaining to the fos jun family of transacting factors as well as toa class of these factors that remained to be characterized. Following the inroad opened by these results the different HUMTH01 alle les were thus evaluated in the context of the TH gene. Specific transactingfactors were then cloned. Finally the methylation profile of CpG islandflanking the repeated sequence was investigated to evaluate the role ofepigenetic modifications in the transcriptional regulation of the TH gene. The HUMTH01 alleles were found to differentially modulate TH gene activ ity in a quantitative manner. One of the specific transacting factors exhibitsaffinity for the HUMTH01 sequence correlated with variations in the num ber of (TCAT)n repetitions. TH+ and TH human cell lines exhibited differ ential methylation patterns and a new putative Ap2 site in the first exon ofthe TH gene was identified. The (TCAT)n polymorphic sequence is widespread throughout theConcurrent Symposia 69genome. Thus the characterization of the transduction pathway impinging on the HUMTH01 microsatellite and its flanking sequences may be rele vant for the transcriptional regulation of the TH gene as well as that of othergenes implicated in normal and pathological complex genetic traits. ,2001
136,Molecular genetic testing is in a process of transition from a researchbased activity to a more routine service. Service providers are developingprocedures to make tests more reliable ways of measuring the errors inlaboratory testing and mechanisms to manage the whole laboratoryprocess for quality. Scientists leading genetic testing laboratories tend tothink about quality first in terms of the accuracy and reproducibility of theanalytical process the reliability of mechanisms for handling materials andinformation and the quality of the information in the report from the labora tory. By contrast the perception of quality by the consumer (patients theirfamilies and their physicians) may have a different emphasis. The con sumers usually take the accuracy of the test for granted and think firstabout whether a test is available whether they have easy access to theservice and how long a result will take to be reported. Service providersneed to place more consideration on the needs of the client and place theirclients at the centre of the quality management process. Policy makers andregulators need to think about the problem of availability and access totesting given the rarity of many genetic conditions. They also need todevelop simple but effective systems to promote quality management andto encourage service providers to comply with recognised internationalstandards. ,2001
137,The number of Home Brew tests being introduced into the genetic test ing market is increasing at a pace commensurate with the increase ingenetic information resulting from the Human Genome Project. As moregenes relevant to predisposition diagnosis and prognosis are identified thepressure to bring clinically relevant genetic tests to the market willincrease. The quality of these tests and the regulatory environment intowhich they are introduced will determine in part the success of the HumanGenome Project in terms of its impact on human health in the near term. Genetic testing laboratories both commercial and academic are underincreasing pressure to assure the quality of their testing facilities and tech nologies. The balance that is to be struck between appropriate regulationand a regulatory environment that would impede progress is currentlyunder close study. In the interim an emphasis on quality control for homebrew testing remains a critical part of test development and practice. Thefact that this effort is often driven by individual laboratory commitments toexcellence in test development and practice will be discussed. ,2001
138,Genetic testing has most often been associated with predictive testing foruntreatable conditions such as Huntington s disease or prenatal testingaccompanied by an offer of termination of affected pregnancies. The iso lation of genes associated with common forms of potentially preventable diseases such as heart disease cancer as well as with risk factors such assmoking and obesity raise the possibility of providing such information tothose without family histories. It is envisaged that informing individuals oftheir genetic susceptibility to disease will motivate them to change theirbehaviour to reduce their risks. Drawing upon the few studies to date thathave addressed this question this paper will describe two possible barri ers to behaviour change following the provision of genetic risk informationand consider how these might be overcome.1. Perceived non salience of genetic risk information Acceptance of riskinformation depends in part upon the extent to which the informationmakes sense to an individual ie fits with existing schema or representa tions of a health threat. Perceiving familial adenomatous polyposis asdetermined by factors other than genes was associated with expecting tocontinue bowel screening despite a negative result on genetic testing. Thissuggests the importance of eliciting and discussing with those undergoing such tests their beliefs about the condition for which testing is being con ducted. ,2001

140,Our work supports and extends the hypothesis that a protein can serve asan element of genetic inheritance. This protein only mechanism of inheri tance propagates in much the same way as previously hypothesized forthe mammalian prion protein the infectious agent in the spongiformencephalopathies (such as Mad cow disease). In yeast however theprocess produces heritable changes in phenotype not disease. The yeastprion we study [ PSI +] is a dominant cytoplasmically inherited trait caused when a component of the translational termination factor Sup35p under goes a conformational switch that causes it to aggregate. This reduces theefficiency of the termination factor and permits ribosomes to read throughstop codons at an appreciable frequency. A crucial aspect of this processis that the prion form of Sup35p promotes conversion of newly synthesizedSup35p to the prion form thus Sup35p prion aggregates cause an inher itable change in phenotype without a concomitant change in nucleic acid. We have provided genetic cell biological and biochemical evidence in sup port of this revolutionary hypothesis and a molecular model for how pro tein only inheritance might occur. Most recently we have begun to deter mine the molecular basis of variants of [ PSI+] which seem to be analo gous to mammalian prion strains. Individual yeast strains can propagatedifferent [ PSI +] variants which exhibit different nonsense suppression effi ciencies and stabilities. Similarly mammalian prion variants can be main tained in isogenic mice yet are distinguished by differences in incubationtime for disease onset brain pathology and degree of species specificity. Our data shows that [ PSI +] variants differ in how efficiently Sup35p is con verted to the prion form. This affects the balance of the soluble and prionform of Sup35p which determines the strength of nonsense suppressionphenotype of [ PSI +] variants. ,2001
141,Several genetic epidemiological studies have suggested the existence ofpredisposing genetic factors in Parkinson s disease which can be consid ered to be a multifactorial disorder. However at least five monogenic formshave been recognized which should help to understand the pathologicalmechanisms. Studies on the alpha synuclein and Parkin genes have been70 Concurrent Symposiavery fruitful. The alpha synuclein gene has been implicated in a small number of fami lies with autosomal dominant Parkinson s disease with Lewy bodies. Sub sequently alpha synuclein turned out to be a major component of Lewybodies and Lewy neurites. The familial mutations increase oligomerisationof alpha synuclein into fibrillar structures which are found in Lewy bodies. Animal models over expressing normal and mutated alpha synucleinreproduce some features of Parkinson s disease. A wide variety of Parkin mutations are associated with autosomal reces sive Parkinson s disease. They account for half of the early onset familialcases and a significant proportion of patients without family history but withearly onset. In addition to early onset Parkin cases are characterized byfrequent dystonia at onset excellent and sustained response to levodopawith frequent levodopa induced dyskinesias and slow progression of the disease. It was recently shown that Parkin which is expressed ubiquitous ly in the central nervous system functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. There fore Parkin is expected to ubiquitinate specific substrates targeted fordegradation by the proteasome. Interestingly Parkin patients presentsevere nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal loss without Lewy bodies. Thisparticularity might be related to the function of Parkin for which it is nowcrucial to identify the substrates. It will also be necessary understand the relevance of these observations toidiopathic Parkinson s disease. ,2001
142,Yeast is arguably the most powerful experimental organism for learningabout the basic function of genes involved in intracellular eukaryoticprocesses. The combination of classical genetics recombinant genetics and biochemistry offers a definitive approach to understanding proteinfunction in cells. Furthermore the availability of the entire yeast genomicsequence has spawned the development of genome wide or system wideapproaches to the analysis of gene function in yeast. These functionalgenomic methods are of great value to yeast genetics research and alsoplace yeast as a critical testbed for these emerging technologies. Linksbetween human disease genes and yeast genes provide immediate pro tein functional data and an experimental paradigm for further analysis of disease relevant biology. They can also be used to accelerate the identifi cation of disease genes. It is important to emphasize that the link to a yeastgene often provides connection to an entire genetic pathway a multi pro tein complex or interacting gene products. These additional links can bekey to an understanding of disease mechanism or development of a ther apeutic strategy. The discovery of a relationship between a human disease gene and agene found in yeast is clearly advantageous but how can these connec tions be established in a systematic fashion? Three general paradigmshave emerged 1) Human/yeast similarity searching 2) Genome cross referencing 3) Homology probing . The worm and fly genome sequencesmake multi organismal approaches for understanding human biology evenmore powerful. These organisms provide complementing experimentalapproaches and aspects of eukaryotic biology not approachable in yeast. Given the unique experimental advantages of the yeast system yeastgenetics/genomics approaches will continue to be a crucial component inmedical genetics research for the foreseeable future. ,2001
143,Genomes like all other databases that are linked to other databases arepotentially in danger of infection by parasitic elements viruses and trans posons. The human genome consists for approximately 50% of trans posons. Networked computers need to be protected against computerviruses by virus protection software. Likewise genomes are protected by amechanism of transposon silencing. We have analysed this in the nema tode C. elegans. The surprise finding is that the mechanism of transposonsilencing in C. elegans is esentially the same in animals plants and fungi. Thus we are beginning to understand an ancient mechanism that organ isms use to protect themselves against invading selfish DNA. The currentstatus of our understanding of the mechanism will be described. ,2001
144,Three metabolic/behavioral phenotypes determine the body weight andcomposition of an organism energy intake energy expenditure and thepartitioning of stored calories among glycogen protein and fat. The recentmolecular cloning of rodent single gene obesity mutations and the disrup tion of other genes by transgenic techniques has identified some of theimportant molecular substrates for these processes. A variety of physio logical and neurophysiological experiments indicate that the hypothlala mus receives humoral signals reporting the mass of adipocytes in thebody and uses this information to generate efferent neural signals thathave coordinate effects on intake expenditure and partitioning. An impor tant afferent signal is the hormone leptin produced and secreted primarilyby adipocytes. This gene is mutant in the Lepob (obese) mouse and itscognate receptor is mutant in the Leprdb (diabetes) mouse. Deficiency ofthe ligand or receptor is perceived physiologically as a deficiency of ener gy stores for which the organism compensates by coordinate increases inenergy intake and reductions in energy expenditure. The model of leptin asa molecular signal of sufficiency of energy stores (for reproduction and sur vival of prolonged caloric restriction) is compatible with evolutionary argu ments regarding the characteristics of a system designed to optimize sur vival/reproductive efficiency in hostile environments. Among the hypothal amic neuropeptides whose expression is altered by leptin are NPY POMC CART HCRT/OREXIN MCH CRH AGRP. The recently described chem ical neuroanatomy of the neurons expressing these peptides is consistentwith the long standing observations that ablations of the ventromedial andlateral hypothalamic regions result respectively in hyper and hypophagia. The precise roles of these neurons and neuropeptides in controlling bodycomposition are not yet known. Obese humans with mutations in LEP LEPR LEPR (processed to ? MSH) and mc4r (receptor for msh) havebeen reported. In some populations up to 5% of severe obesity can beaccounted for by haploinsufficiency of MC4R. However in most instances susceptibility to obesity is probably conveyed by the interactions amongseveral of these (and other) genes and environmental circumstance. These gene gene interactions may in the aggregate set the functionalthreshold for leptin s ability to provide a signal of energy sufficiency. Sub tle coding and regulatory sequence variants may act additively and epista tically to alter this threshold. ,2001
145,Genetics has become established in the popular view as exciting andthreatening in equal measure. Its impact on future medicine is taken as afact. Most commentators fail to distinguish between genetic technologieswhich will become incorporated in to general diagnostics just as bloodgroups did in past years and the application of genetics to inherited dis ease. The latter includes diagnosis and assistance in reproductive choiceand predictive testing. As a medical specialty clinical genetics has followedtwo paths. The first involves clinical geneticists in small numbers acting asan academic focus with most applications dispersed to individual speciali ties. The second as seen for example in the UK and the Netherlands involves a large cohort of clinical geneticists supported by genetic nursesand counsellors acting as a focus for large scale application of geneticknowledge in medical practice. Chance history religion and money all playa part in determining which pathway is followed. The question is whetherthey can or should converge and if not which will become the dominantmodel in the health services of tomorrow. ,2001
146,The Island of Cuba with 11 million inhabitants an infant mortality about7/1000 life expectancy in 75 years with a free national health systembased in a well developed primary health care (more than 90% of popula tion covered by family doctors) started a National Program for the Diagno sis and Prevention of Genetic Diseases in 1982 and all the island wascovered by this service ten years later. After delineation of the most fre quent genetic disorders and birth defects (2.2/live births with NTDÃÂ«s 3 7%of the populaqtion is a carrier of hemoglobinopathies (Hb S or Hb C) 4%Concurrent Symposia 71of pregnant women over 38 years old 3% of the population is a carrier for CF) the development of appropriate local technologies and organizationalclinical evaluation together with the Mother and Child Department of theMinistry of Health have permitted to offer a genetic service for all the pop ulation.

147,In 1990 genetic service were not considered to be part of Primary HealthCare (PHC) in South Africa specifically not in the underdeveloped poorrural African areas where very little epidemiological information/data exist ed on the incidence/prevalence of genetic disorders and birth defects. Thegeneral perception was that congenital disorders were not a health prob lem of significance in rural South Africa. This concept that a clinical genet ic service was an inappropriate luxury in these developing countries obfus cated the fact that in such countries the incidence of congenital disorderswas as high and in certain circumstances higher than in industrializedcountries. The Northern Province South Africa is one of the poorest and most under developed vast rural areas of South Africa inhabited by 5 2 million peopleof which 95% are indigenous black people from the Venda Pedi andShangaan tribes while approximately 50% are still illiterate. Most house holds are still without electricity running water and sanitation while publictransport is almost non existing with very poor rail and road infrastructure even though most 1st World technology is on its doorstep but not accessi ble. In 1989 a research project Screening Programme To Diagnose Congen ital/Genetic Abnormalities Among New Born Babies At Mankweng Hospi tal was started and is still continuing at several Hospitals in the Province. From this small beginning this project developed into a multiphase com munity based PHC genetic/disability program that led to numerous devel opments and activities in many Hospitals Institutions and Schools for thephysical visual auditory and intellectually disabled. The numerous facets of developments and activities will be discussed including training of PHC workers screening projects research coun selling service provision and establishment of parent support groupsamong the rural disadvantaged communities. It also provided for the firsttime information from rural South Africa on the incidence and frequency ofcongenital disorders in general and of specific common syndromes includ ing Down syndrome Albinism and NTD s. ,2001
148,Present FISH karyotyping is based on the so called combinatorial use ofprobes labelled with 5 distinct fluorophores. For such combinatoriallabelling it has been shown that the number of targets (n) recognizable byFISH using (k) different fluorophores results in n= 2k 1 colours. The principle of COBRA FISH is based on the simultaneous use of combi natorial labelling and so called ratiolabelling which allows for simultane ous staining of many more targets than reported so far. Three spectrallywell separated fluorophores are used pair wise for ratiolabelling allowinga total of 12 colours to be distinguished. A second set of 12 probes rec ognizing different targets are labelled exactly the same but in addition aregiven a fourth label resulting in a total of 24 colours. The fifth label is sub sequently used to repeat this principle once again to accomplish full stain ing of p and q arms using arm specific probes. The fifth label may also beused to label any probe of interest to identify and locate a definedsequence in a FISH karyogram. Multi colour COBRA FISH was applied to detect cryptic translocations andabnormalities in patients with abnormal phenotype but normal Giemsakaryotype to study HPV 16 integration sites in cervical cancer cell linesand to perform 48 colour staining in complex rearrangements karyogramsfrom human solid tumours. Other work relates to the application of thesame methodology for mouse paints to study mouse tumour models anda full set of sub telomeric probes for clinical diagnostic use. ,2001
149,There is widespread enthusiasm for mapping genes associated withalmost any human trait. The hope is that the identification of commongenetic variation with substantial effect will transform biomedicine and dra matic claims have been about this to the public. But studies of complextraits have been frustrated by problems of genetic inference in the face ofcausal complexity. Some of these problems are fundamental rather than72 Concurrent Symposiareflecting limitations on sample size sample design or biotechnology. The issues are understandable when considered from an evolutionary popula tion point of view. Etiologic heterogeneity is to be expected and probably isinherent in complex traits like chronic disease for reasons that are well known and supported by a wealth of existing data. I will talk about the his tory of ideas on the nature of heredity with regard to disease the relevanceof a population evolutionary perspective on the problem and some of thesocietal issues that arise in the study of the genetics of complex traits. ,2001
150,Isolated populations that are founded recently by a small number offounders have been considered ideal populations for mapping genesunderlying complex diseases. Among many other advantages such popu lation may have higher level of linkage disequilibrium compared withthose more outbred populations is ideal for a genome wide associationstudy. In the last several years we studied six putative isolated populationsin China by typing microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms forX and Y chromosomes trying to understand the genetic structure of thoseisolated populations. We also conducted genome wide scan on three ofthose populations which allows us to look into the fine detail of the popu lations. Those analyses will be reported in this presentation. ,2001
151,Patterns of genetic diversity in today s populations contain informationabout past demographic processes. Archaeological evidence suggests (1)that Europe has been first colonised in Upper Paleolithic times by peoplecoming from the Levant (2) that these populations contracted and thenreexpanded in response to climate changes in Mesolithic times and (3)that a new wave of immigrants came in from the Levant with the Neolithicspread of early farmers. It is not clear to what extent each of these threephenomena affected the current European gene pool. Establishing it isinteresting per se but it would also facilitate our understanding of the dis tributions of disease alleles. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of both protein and nuclear DNA datashows that broad clines encompassing much of Europe are the rule. At themitochondrial level conversely a gradient is evident only in the Mediter ranean region but not in northern Europe. Analyses based on admixturemodels identify the contributions of two founding populations one Westernand one Eastern which one would be tempted to equate respectively withthe descendants of Paleolithic hunter gatherers and of the early Neolithicfarmers. However especially at the Y chromosome level there is also evi dence of gene flow from Northern Asia into Europe. The parallel clines observed at most loci studied and the estimated admix ture rates suggest that much of the current European diversity has beenshaped by a directional expansion from one extreme of the continent. Thatresult and the recent separation of the European gene pools estimatedfrom microsatellite data do not suggest that phenomena of Mesolithicreexpansion from glacial refugia have played a crucial role in determiningthe overall patterns and levels of diversity in the European gene pool. ,2001
152,Advanced genomic technologies has led to the isolation of many genesinvolved in human disease and the study of the human genome is nowmoving towards understanding the function of the proteins these genesencode (functional genomics). The intricate structure and multiple celltypes of the inner ear requires a range of proteins with different functions including maintenance of structural integrity neuronal innervation andmechanoelectrical transduction. There has been remarkable progress inthe field of hereditary hearing loss over the past five years in elucidatingthe molecular basis of hearing loss. This has been no easy task as humandeafness is extremely heterogeneous. Not only is there great variability inthe clinical features of human hearing loss (HL) but mutations in the samegenes can contribute to syndromic nonsyndromic prelingual and pro gressive deafness. I will discuss research being done in my own laborato ry putting our results in context of the field in general including the uncon ventional myosin VI and Snell s waltzer mouse the POU4F3 transcriptionfactor and DFNA15 human deafness locus and inherited connexin 26mutations associated with human non syndromic hearing loss. Emphasiswill be placed on the advantages offered by the mouse as a model forhuman deafness. ,2001
153,Genetic factors contribute to a wide range of the disorders that causeblindness and visual disability. Inherited ocular diseases comprise the sin gle most common group amongst those of childhood onset. Recent dis coveries have underlined the complexity of genetic ophthalmic disease currently over 135 genes and loci are defined causing retinal diseasealone. Locus heterogeneity is common as illustrated by disorders of both anteri or (e.g. anterior segment dysgenesis autosomal dominant cataract) andposterior segments (e.g. retinal and macular dystrophies). The major stepstaken to define the exact genetic basis of many of these conditions maynow be used for diagnosis and counseling. In some cases this may behelpful in directing management and treatment of affected patients. Thispossibility has been demonstrated both in man as well as in animal mod els and will be illustrated with reference to the corneal dystrophies (honey comb Ries Bucklers granular and lattice dystrophies) anterior segmentdysgenesis syndromes (aniridia goniodysgeneses and Rieger syndrome)as well macular dystrophies (Stargardt disease). Many multisystemic conditions (e.g. Phakomatoses Norrie disease Vitre oretinopathies) have an ocular component. The biochemical pathwaysinvolved in their aetiology are crucial to the development and maintenanceof different organ systems. Combining the advantages of detailed ocularphenotypic definition with an expanding understanding of their molecularbasis sheds light on molecular mechanisms of general significance. Thiswill be illustrated with reference to the role of the hedgehog (Shh) path ways in vitreoretinal/neurodevelopment as well as disorders of extracellu lar matrix construction. Many of the commonest causes of blindness (cataract glaucoma andmacular degeneration) have important genetic components in their aetiol ogy yet these remain unknown. Addressing this area remains a major chal lenge for the future. ,2001
154,"One of the major challenges in the post genomic era will be the identifica tion of sequences participating in the regulatory circuitry controlling geneexpression. For the analysis of genomic DNA algorithms and databasesare available facilitating the identification of those sequences encodinggenes. While these sorts of computational aids are largely not available forthe identification of noncoding sequences participating in gene regulation cross species sequence comparisons provide a robust means for identify ing putative gene regulatory sequences. Using this approach to identifygene regulatory sequences we have examined orthologous regions ofhuman 5q31 and mouse chromosome 11 DNA of biomedical importancedue to the clustering of a several interleukin genes. The functional proper ties of the largest noncoding element (401 BP >85% conserved betweenhumans and mice) located in the IL4 IL13 intergenic interval were exam ined in depth. To identify its function knockout mice lacking this 401 BPelement as well as YAC transgenics with and without the element wereexamined. Analysis of the animals revealed that this noncoding sequenceplays a prominent role in the regulation of IL4 IL13 and IL5 genes that arespread over 120KB. The comparative genomic strategy used here for iden tifying noncoding sequence of biological import has led to the discovery ofa regulatory element that acts over significant genomic distance to coordi nate the expression of several genes involved in the inflammatoryresponse. We have carried out similar studies in other regions of thegenome that further illustrate the power of cross species sequence analy sis coupled with functional studies in mice to investigate the gene regula tory circuitry of mammals. Concurrent Symposia 73S50. The Rise and Fall of the Mammalian Y Chromosome J. A. Marshall Graves Research School of Biological Sciences The Australian National Universi ty Canberra AustraliaJ. G', 'In mammals sex is determined by an XY male XX female system in whicha male dominant gene on the Y (SRY) determines sex. Sex chromosomesevidently evolved from an original autosome pair as the Y chromosomewas progressively degraded. This view of a wimp Y is supported by ourfindings that even genes that are testis specific and have important func tions in male determination or differentiation have partners on the X fromwhich they ultimately evolved. In particular the SRY gene which deter mines sex in humans and mice has a partner (SOX3) on the X in all ther ian mammals from which it is thought to have been derived. The mammalian Y chromosome must have arisen after the divergence ofmammals from other vertebrates more than 300 million years ago sincebirds and reptiles subscribe to completely non homologous sex determin ing systems. To explore the origins of the mammalian Y chromosome andSRY we compared the Y chromosomes of the three major mammal groups(eutherians marsupials and monotremes). We find that some genesshared by the human X and Y chromosomes are also on the sex chromo somes in marsupials and monotremes implying that part of the mam malian Y chromosome is at least 170 million years old. However mosthuman X Y shared genes are located in autosomal clusters in marsupialsand monotremes implying that the human Y chromosome is largelyderived from a region added to sex chromosomes recently in the eutherianlineage. Thus most of the original Y has degraded. In two rodent species(mole voles) the Y has completely disappeared. The genes on the Y chromosome evolved from genes on the X and thoseremaining have been retained because they evolved a vital male specificfunction. In particular the SRY gene which determines sex in humans andmice evolved from the brain specific nan",2001
155,Many years ago S. Ohno postulated that the placental mammalian X chromosome was evolutionarily conserved. He postulated that this con servation was due to the dosage compensation mechanism for X linkedgenes that rely on the functional inactivation of X chromosomes in somat ic cells. Now it seems that most autosomes are also extensively con served. This conclusion is supported by both comparative gene mappingand more recently by molecular cytogenetics showing that huge tracts ofthe human genome are found in large syntenic blocks across differentmammalian orders for tens of millions of years. Chromosome painting datawith human chromosome specific probes are available for a good numberof primates tree shrew various carnivores artiodactyls dolphin whales horse bat rabbit squirrel and the common shrew. Although one half ofthe about 19 placental mammalian orders have not yet been analyzed bymolecular cytogenetic techniques it is probable that the ancestral placen tal mammalian karyotype had about 50 chromosomes. Many of these chro mosome syntenies are still conserved in humans or differ only by simplereciprocal translocations. Since chromosome translocations are generallyvery rare events (about one translocation every ten million years in mostphylogenies) they are useful markers to help establish phylogenies. Here this will be demonstrated for New World primates were chromosome paint ing was especially helpful. The dynamics of chromosome rearrangements however is not linear over time in different orders. In some phylogenies wecan observe sudden outbreaks of chromosome reshuffling. This will beshown for some primates artiodactyls and carnivores. Chromosome paint ing can help in the understanding of these reshufflings that are often farbeyond the resolution of classical banding patterns. With more chromo some painting data available from other mammalian orders and includingthe huge data set available from chromosome banding studies in mam mals a deeper understanding of the gross architecture and evolution of the human genome can be obtained. ,2001
156,There is increasing recognition that stochastic processes underlie the high ly predictable patterns of gene expression in developing organisms. Inmany systems the response of a gene to intermediate levels of an induc er has been shown to be a stochastic all or none response. Experimentaldata and inferential reasoning demonstrate that the balance between geneactivation and de activation rates is a critical variable for achieving speci fied levels of gene activity. Models of intermittent gene expression haveimplications for understanding human disease gene dosage can protectagainst intermittent lapses in gene expression and increase the pre dictability of a response to a graded stimulus. Therefore some haploinsuf ficiency syndromes might result from an increased susceptibility to sto chastic delays of gene initiation or interruptions of gene expression. Although little is known regarding the relative on rates and off rates ofgene expression highly unstable gene expression provides a selectiveadvantage both for signal discrimination and as a mechanism of limitingthe prevalance of mutations in a population. ,2001
157,Deletions of human chromosome 22q11 occur in approximately 1 4000 livebirths and are associated with a number of haploinsufficiency syndromes including DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes. The deleted region Ã¢\x80\x94 or DiGeorge Chromosomal Region ( DGCR ) Ã¢\x80\x94 is entirely cloned and sequenced. Despite this human genetic techniques in isolation have so farfailed to unequivocally demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of any specificgene is required to produce this syndrome. As many genes at 22q11 showconservation of synteny in the mouse several laboratories haveaddressed the role of single genes and groups of genes using mouse mod els. Direct deletion and Cre lox mediated deletion and duplication havebeen used to create a shortest region of deletion overlap for a murineDgcr . 1n 1999 Baldini s group demonstrated that embryos hemizygous for the Dgcr have hypo/aplasia of the 4 thpharyngeal arch artery at nan,2001
158,Orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for several inbornerrors of metabolism. Unfortunately the supply of donor organs is limitingand therefore many patients cannot benefit from this therapy. In contrast hepatocyte transplantation could potentially overcome the shortage indonor livers by use of cells from a single donor for multiple recipients. Inclassic hepatocyte transplantation however only <1% of the liver mass orless can be replaced by donor cells. Recently though it has been shownin animal models that >90% of host hepatocytes can be replaced by asmall number of transplanted donor cells in a process we term therapeu tic liver repopulation . This phenomenon is analogous to repopulation ofthe hematopoietic system after bone marrow transplantation. Liver repop ulation occurs when transplanted cells have a growth advantage in the set ting of damage to recipient liver cells. For human therapeutic application cadaveric donors are the most likelysource transplantable hepatocytes. This presents problems for the acqui sition distribution and quality control of these cells. Very recently it hasbeen discovered that transplanted cells from extrahepatic sources such asthe adult pancreas or bone marrow can also be used for liver repopulation. Because bone marrow donors are widely available this finding raises thehope of therapeutic application of these cells in the future. The current knowledge regarding therapeutic liver repopulation and thehopeful implications for treatment of liver diseases will be discussed. ,2001
159,Genetic defects in sterol metabolizing enzymes have recently emerged asimportant causes of dysmorphogenetic syndromes. They affect enzymesrequired for the removal of methyl groups at C4(NSHDL) the shift of the double bond from C8 9to C7 8(3ÃÂ§ sterol D 8 D7isomerase/EBP E. C. 5.3.3.5) and the removal of the double bond at C7 8(D7 sterol reduc tase/DHCR7 E. C. 1.3.1.21). Missense and nonsense mutations in NSHDL on Xq28 cause X chromosomal dominant CHILD syndrome (congenitalhemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects MIM308050) a rare inborn disorder which affects bone and skin in femalesand is presumably lethal in males. NSHDL is involved in C4sterol demethylation but its precise biochemical function remains to be clarified. Nonsense and missense mutations in the same gene ( Nshdl ) underly the Bare patches and Striated mutations in mice. Recurrent missense andnonsense mutations in EBP (Emopamil binding protein) on Xp11.22 are found in patients with X chromosomal dominant chondrodysplasia puncta ta (Conradi H nermann syndrome CDPX2 MIM302960). CDPX2 is char acterized by skeletal (epiphyseal stippling limb shortening short stature)and epidermal (atrophy ichthyosis hyperkeratosis) manifestations as wellas occasional sectorial cataracts. The mouse mutant Tattered carries amissense mutation in Ebp. The clinical differentiation between CHILD syn drome and CDPX2 is controversial. The morphological phenotypes of Barepatches and Tattered are similar to each other and ressemble CHILD syn drome as well as CDPX2 including lethality in male embryos. Cholesterolcrossfeeding between cell patches in which either the X chromosome car rying the wildtype or the mutant allele are active possibly explains why nei ther in CHILD syndrome nor in CDPX2 total cholesterol levels are reduced. In contrast substantially reduced total sterol concentrations are a hallmarkof the more frequent autosomal recessive Smith Lemli Opitz/RSH syn drome (SLOS MIM270400) due to mutations in DHCR7 in 11q13. SLOS is characterized by dysmorphogenesis (e.g. syndactyly heart and lungdefects) failure to thrive and mental retardation or autism. A recentlydescribed induced mouse mutant in Dhcr7 had the biochemical character Concurrent Symposia 75istics of the SLOS and most surprisingly symptoms of severe neurological deficits such as reduced physical activity and uncoordinated swallowing.

160,Information regarding the phenotype of TAR syndrome is largely based onsingle case reports. In order to delineate the phenotype 32 patients diag nosed with TAR syndrome underwent clinical and cytogenetic analysis. Allcases except 1 had bilateral radial aplasia. The thumbs were present in allcases but morphology and function were abnormal. Lower limb defectsoccurred in 47% cardiac anomalies (e.g. tetralogy of Fallot) in 16%.Thrombocytopenia may be as aymptomatic and remain undetected untillater life. Early detection is associated with low morbidity highlighting thevalue of haematological investigation in patients with radial aplasia. Previ ous reports of urogenital abnormalities were rare however in this studyanomalies were found in 25% of cases. The association of TAR syndromeand cow s milk intolerance is well described in this study 43% of casesshowed cow s milk intolerance and 25% had experienced prolonged boutsof gastroenteritis. Three atypical cases were found. Two showed featuresof Robert s syndrome and the third had mental retardation and genitouri nary anomalies suggestive of DK phocomelia. Four sib pairs were found. A female excess (23 female 8 male one case unknown) was observed. Chromosome breakage studies were normal in all cases tested. Two fur ther cytogenetic abnormalities are under investigation and have provideduseful candidate genes for further study based on role in limb developmentand haematopoiesis. This study suggests that the phenotype for TAR syn drome is wider than previously reported. The condition may be heteroge neous with implications for genetic counselling and gene identification. ,2001
161,EEC syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by Ectrodactyly Ectodermal dysplasia and facial Clefting. We recently demonstrated thatmutations in the p63 gene a homolog of the tumor suppressor gene p53 cause EEC syndrome. An extended analysis revealed heterozygous p63mutations in 34 of 37 unrelated EEC families indicating that p63 is themajor if not the only gene involved in EEC syndrome. EEC syndromeshows some overlap with several distinct syndromes including Hay Wells/AEC syndrome Limb Mammary Syndrome (LMS) ADULT syn drome and Split Hand/Foot Malformation (SHFM). Mutation analysis of thep63 gene was performed to investigate the possibility of allelism for these disorders. Causative mutations were identified in AEC syndrome (8 muta tions) ADULT syndrome (1 mutation) LMS (1 mutation) and SHFM (4mutations). For EEC and AEC syndrome the position and predicted effectof the mutations is clearly different. The majority of mutations in EEC syn drome are amino acid substitutions in the DNA binding domain and affecttransactivational properties of p63. AEC syndrome is consistently causedby amino acid substitutions in the SAM domain and are predicted to affectprotein protein interactions. The effect of the mutations in SHFM LMS andADULT is less straightforward. To gain more insight in the functional con sequences of the p63 mutations we are studying the characteristics of nor mal and mutant p63 proteins in transactivation assays immunolocalizationand protein protein interaction studies. These approaches aim to find molecular explanations for these distinct disorders and hence establish aphenotype genotype correlation for p63 gene mutations. ,2001
162,Mutations in GLI3 have been associated with two malformation syndromes(Pallister Hall and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndromes (PHS &GCPS)) and several types of polydactyly. Controversy persists regardingpotential correlation of specfic mutation types with some results suggest ing there is no correlation of mutation type and phenotype. Here we shownew results that strongly suggest that a correlation exists. The data com prise 19 families with PHS and 5 families with GCPS whose GLI3 genemutation has been determined. We combine these data with publishedcases of PHS & GCPS where mutations have been determined. There arenow more than 50 cases of known GLI3 mutations. In GCPS there aremore than 10 large deletions 5 translocations 7 frameshifts 5 of the zincfingers 2 missense 3 splice mutations and 3 frameshifts 3 of the zinc fin ger. In PHS 21 of 21 patients have frameshifts 3 of the zinc fingers. Thisis a non random distribution of mutations that supports the hypothesis thatGCPS is caused by functional haploinsufficiency of GLI3 and PHS iscaused by 3 truncations. We will propose a hypothesis to account for theunusual 3 frameshift mutations in GCPS and review relevant animal modeldata. ,2001
163,Acheiropodia is a unique condition presenting with bilateral congenitalamputations of the upper and lower extremities and aplasia of the handsand feet. This severely handicapping developmental disorder appears toaffect only the extremities with no other systemic manifestations reported. With the exception of two affected siblings in Puerto Rico the reportedcases are of Brazilian origin. The incidence of acheiropodia in Brazil hasbeen estimated to be approximately 1/250 000 births. Acheiropodia isinherited as an autosomal recessive trait and the heterozygotes are phe notypically normal. The vast majority of affected individuals are the off spring of consanguineous matings. A locus for Acheiropodia has beenmapped to chromosome 7q36. To facilitate the identification of the generesponsible for this disorder we first refined the acheiropodia critical regionby haplotype analysis and subsequently identified a common mutation inC7orf2 the human orthologue of the mouse Lmbr1 gene responsible forthe disease. Analysis of a panel of five Acheiropodia families with fifteenpolymorphic markers narrowed the critical region to 1.3 cM based onidentity by descent and to less than 0.5 Mb by physical mapping. Analysisof C7orf2 the human orthologue of the mouse Lmbr1 gene that has beenimplicated in mouse mutant Hemimelic extra toes identified a deletion inall five families thus identifying a common Acheiropodia mutation. Thedeletion was identified at both the genomic DNA and mRNA level. It leadsto the production of a C7orf2 transcript lacking exon 4 and introduces apremature stop codon downstream of exon 3. Given the nature of theAcheiropodia phenotype it appears likely that the Lmbr1 gene plays animportant role in limb development. ,2001
164, heidelberg.deWith an incidence of 3 in 100 idiopathic short stature is a fairly frequentdiagnosis in children. Idiopathic short stature refers to a heterogenous76 Concurrent Sessionsgroup of patients which are short due to different reasons. Mutations of a human homeobox gene SHOX have been recently shown to underlie theshort stature phenotype in patients with Turner syndrome and mostpatients with L ri W eill dyschondrosteosis. Here we address the question on the incidence and type of SHOX mutations seen in children with shortstature of unknown aetiology termed idiopathic. We have analysed theSHOX gene for intragenic mutations by single strand conformation poly morphism (SSCP) and for complete gene deletion by flourescence in situhybridisation (FISH) in 820 and 150 patients respectively. We have identi fied nonsense missense and a small deletion in the coding region ofSHOX ( 8/820). In 150 patients we were able to also carry out FISH analy sis and detected 4 complete gene deletions ( 4/150). At least seven muta tions (7/12) could be shown to be truly functional by comparing with thegenotype and phenotype of the parents. Consequently SHOX mutationshave been detected in more than 2 % of children with idiopathic shortstature. The spectrum of SHOX mutations is biased with the vast majorityleading to complete gene deletions. Children with SHOX mutations havebeen shown in retrospect to often derive from families where older affect ed family members show mild skeletal features reminescent of the Turnerskeletal features. Short patients with a normal karyotype and the presenceof any of the Turner characteristic dysmorphic skeletal features such ashigh arched palate short neck abnormal auricular development cubitusvalgus genu valgum short 4th metacarpals and Madelung deformity orwith frequent otitis media are therefore likely candidates for a SHOX gene disorder. ,2001
165,Malfunction of mismatch repair (MMR) genes produces nuclear genomeinstability (NGI) and plays an important role in the origin of some heredi tary and sporadic human cancers. The appearance of non inheritedmicrosatellite alleles in tumor cells (microsatellite instability MSI) is one ofthe expressions of NGI. We present here data showing mitochondrialgenome instability (mtGI) in most of the human cancers analysed so far. The mt DNA markers used were point mutations length tract instability ofmono or dinucleotide repeats mono or dinucleotide insertions or dele tions and long deletions. Comparison of normal and tumoral tissues fromthe same individual reveals that mt mutations may show as homoplasmic(all tumor cells have the same variant haplotype) or as heteroplasmic(tumor cells are a mosaic of inherited and acquired variant haplotypes).Breast colorectal gastric and kidney cancers exhibit mtGI with a patternof mt mutations specific for each tumor. No correlation between NGI andmtGI was found in breast colorectal or kidney cancers while a positivecorrelation was found in gastric cancer. Conversely germ cell testicularcancers lack mtGI. Damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) slipped strand mispairing (SSM) and deficient repair are the causes explaining theappearance of mtGI. The replication and repair of mtDNA are controlled bynuclear genes. So far there is no clear evidence linking MMR gene mal function with mtGI. Polymerase g (POL g) carries out the mtDNA synthe sis. Since this process is error prone due to a deficiency in the proofread ing activity of POL g this enzyme has been assumed to be involved in theorigin of mt mutations. Somatic cells have hundreds to thousands of mtDNA molecules with a very high rate of spontaneous mutations. Accord ingly most somatic cells probably have a low frequency of randomly mutat ed mtDNA molecules. Most cancers are of monoclonal origin. Hence toexplain the appearance of mtGI in tumors we have to explain why a givenvariant mt haplotype expands and replaces part of (heteroplasmy) or all(homoplasmy) wild mt haplotypes in cancer cells. Selective and/or replica tive advantage of some mutations combined with a severe bottleneck dur ing the mitochondrial segregation accompanying mitosis are the mecha nisms probably involved in the origin of mtGI. ,2001
166,We have devised a novel technique that integrates data from more than750 studies on the loss of heterozygosity in breast lung and colorectalcancers. By comparing the data and integrating this with the newlyreleased sequence from the Human Genome Project we have been ableto identify many new regions of the genome that probably contain candi date genes involved in tumor formation. This technique also allows us toidentify regions of the genome that are tumor type specific as well as find ing regions that are lost in multiple tumor types. In addition we appear tobe able to identify regions of the genome that are essential for tumorgrowth in certain cancers but which can be lost in others. Finally thismethod also provides an insight into the pattern of background rates oflosses of heterozygosity on each chromosome this enables us to deter mine whether a particular locus or region is consistently lost compared toits local level. Data will be presented in the form of a new set of loss of heterozygosity maps and graphs which will also be made available at theUniversity of Nottingham LOH database(http //www.nottingham.ac.uk/~pdzmgh/lohdb). ,2001
167,Ovarian epithelial cancer is the most lethal of the cancers unique towomen. Seventy percent of women present with advanced disease with afive year survival in the 15 20% range even with aggressive treatment. Incontrast those women who present with Stage I disease (confined to theovary) have a five year survival in the 80 90% range. Unfortunately verylittle is know about the molecular events underlying the development of thislethal disease. We have used the technique of transcriptional profiling tobegin to develop comprehensive molecular signatures for ovarian epithe lial cancers. Twenty primary ovarian tumors 7 ovarian cancer cell lines anda variety of cultured and non cultured normal ovarian epithelium were ana lyzed for the expression of 25 000 genes on nitrocellulose membranes. Tocomplement this we also constructed subtraction suppression hybridiza tion cDNA libraries from many of the same tumors that were analyzed onmicroarrays. We detected many more down regulated than up regulatedgenes in the ovarian tumors. Many of the consistently down regulatedgenes were found to reside within common fragile site regions providingfurther support that these regions play an important role in cancer devel opment. Most of the same genes were aberrantly regulated in both early(stage I/II) and late (stage III/IV) but our results do support a model wherelater stage tumors have additional alterations generally not present in theearly stage tumors. To complement the transcriptional profiling we alsoperformed comparative genomic hybridization to analyze the gross chro mosomal structure of the profiled ovarian tumors. This analysis revealedthat chromosomal regions that were deleted appeared almost identicalbetween early and late stage tumors. However amplification events werealmost never observed in the early stage tumors but were frequentlyobserved in the late stage tumors. A comparison between gene expressionpatterns and regions of chromosomal deletion or amplification has delin eated several interesting chromosomal regions. Interestingly several ofthese regions are bordered by common fragile sites again implicatingthese regions in important events occuring during cancer development. Wehave used a number of techniques to validate the expression levels ofgenes that appear to be aberrantly regulated in the ovarian tumors. Thisincludes Northern analysis of ovarian cancer cell lines and RT PCR analy sis of primary ovarian tumors. Our most specific is the use of RNA in situto analyze histologically characterized ovarian tumor specimens. We aretherefore working on the generation of a comprehensive molecular signa Concurrent Sessions 77ture for ovarian epithelial cancers. In addition we are working to identify markers for the early detection of ovarian cancer as well as markers thatcan differentiate chemosensitive versus chemoresistant ovarian tumors. Finally we hope to better understand the biology of this poorly understoodtumor through the comprehensive analysis of gene expression. ,2001
168,DNA amplifications have often been attributed to the effects of a single tar get gene such as HER 2 at 17q12 or MYC at 8q24. However many geneshave been implicated in some amplicons such as AIB1 BTAK ZNF217 NABC1 genes at 20q12 q13 or S6 kinase PAT RAD51C TBX2 genes(Cancer Res 60 5340 5344 2000) at 17q23. Here we used CGH andcDNA microarray technologies to undertake a comprehensive survey ofgenes involved in the 17q12 amplification in 11 breast cancer cell lines. Weconstructed a chromosomal region specific cDNA microarray containingover 200 EST clones from the 17q12 region(http //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genemap99/). These cDNA microarrays wereused in the analysis of both gene expression as well as copy number (CGHmicroarrays) which enabled direct detection of amplified and overex pressed genes at 17q12. Comparison with actual copy numbers deter mined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated >90% concor dance with the CGH microarray data. Altogether there were 23 transcriptsthat showed both an increased copy number and expression in four ormore cell lines. These included the HER 2 GRB7 MLN64 and MLN62genes that all have been previously implicated in such amplifications. Inaddition 6 other genes and 13 novel ESTs were also found to be involved. These results were verified using Northern and FISH analysis. In conclu sion parallel analysis of gene copy number and expression levels bymicroarray analysis can be used to quickly identify all candidate targetgenes involved in a high level genomic amplification. ,2001
169,Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome is charac terized by susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC) as well as a variety ofextracolonic cancers notably endometrial cancer (EC). The incidence ofEC even exceeds that of CRC (60% and 54% respectively) in femalemutation carriers. The syndrome is linked to germline mutations in DNAmismatch repair genes mainly MLH1 (~50%) or MSH2 (~40%). Moreover approximately 10% of mutations affect MSH6 and these families often dis play atypical hyperplastic lesions and carcinomas of the endometrium. However the biological basis of the organ involvement remains unknown. To clarify the role of MLH1 MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression as pos sible factors contributing to the HNPCC tumor spectrum we used immuno histochemistry to compare the expression patterns of these proteins in 42ECs and 35 CRCs derived from either the same HNPCC patients or closerelatives carrying the same mutations. Among MSH2 mutation carriers MLH1 was expressed in both tumor types whereas MSH2 and in manycases also MSH6 were absent. Remarkably among MLH1 mutation carri ers 54% of ECs (21/39) but none of CRCs (0/32) lacked the MSH2 and/orMSH6 protein in addition to the lack of MLH1 protein expression. Theseresults demonstrate a marked difference between HNPCC related col orectal and endometrial cancers and suggest that the development of thelatter tumors is selectively associated with the MSH2/MSH6 protein com plex deficiency. ,2001
170,Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare highly metastatic skin tumor of neu roectodermal origin. Little is known about the genetic background of MCC. In previous studies we observed nonrandom losses for 1p 3p 9p 10q and 13q by LOH analysis and by comparative genomic hybridization(CGH) of a large panel of MCC samples. Mutation analysis of candidateTSG genes in these regions provided no evidence for a pivotal role ofthese genes in MCC development. Interestingly the resulting CGH patternof MCC closely resembled that observed in small cell lung carcinoma(SCLC). Both are small cell tumor types sharing several clinical andimmunophenotypical characteristics. Until now the mechanisms of car cinogenesis in both tumors types and the basis of their therapeutic respon siveness remains poorly understood. In order to study the possible rela tionship between MCC and SCLC expression profiling of 8 MCC cell linesand 4 SCLC cell lines were performed on Clontech cDNA expressionarrays representing a total of 1891 different genes. In a preliminary analy sis the mean of all normalized MCC cell lines was compared to that of theSCLCs using 2 D scatter plots. A total of 138 genes encoding several tyro sine kinase interleukin and other receptor associated proteins growth fac tors and cytoskeleton proteins were at least 5 fold higher differentiallyexpressed in MCC. In addition 46 genes were at least 5 fold higher differ entially expressed in SCLC. Detailed data mining including hierarchicalclustering and principal component analysis and verification of differentialgenes using real time quantitative RT PCR will be presented. ,2001
171,Recent advances in high throughput genotyping technology and quantita tive statistical methods have made possible a new flexible approach formapping genes involved in complex multivariate disorders. This involvesusing marker data to infer genetic similarity of many sibling pairs along thelengths of their chromosomes and correlating this similarity with that oftheir phenotypic scores via approaches such as Haseman Elston regres sion (HE) or partitioning of variance components (VC). We performed agenome wide search for loci that influence quantitative measures ofdyslexia in a sample of 119 nuclear dizygotic twin based families ascer tained through at least one reading disabled proband. Our strongest evi dence for linkage was to a locus on chromosome 2p13 16 influencingphoneme awareness (p=0.0016 VC p=0.0053 HE) word recognition(p=0.0069 VC p=0.0006 HE) and orthographic coding (p=0.0058 VC p=0.0221 HE). Suggestive evidence was also found for loci on chromo somes 4 13 and 18. The whole genome approach enables us to judge thesignificance of individual loci against the broader genetic background ofdyslexia susceptibility in our sample in contrast to the majority of geneticstudies of reading disability which have investigated individual loci in iso lation. Intriguingly our chromosome 2p locus overlaps with the regionshowing the strongest evidence for linkage in a genome wide screen of asingle large Norwegian pedigree segregating a qualitatively defineddyslexic phenotype in an autosomal dominant fashion. Therefore the 2plocus influences dyslexia susceptibility in a manner which may be robust tothe major differences in ascertainment strategy phenotypic testing andstatistical analysis that can exist between behavioural genetic studies. ,2001
172,Crohn s di sease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of unknown etiology. Our previous linkage study78 Concurrent Sessionsidentified two loci of genomewide significance 5q31 q33 (IBD5) and 19p13 (IBD6) conferring susceptibility to CD and IBD respectively. The IBD5locus was of particular interest since the region contained a cluster of well characterized immunoregulatory cytokine genes including IL4 IL13 IL5 IL3 and nan,2001
173,Vestibular dysfunction is commonly encountered in otological practice. Inmost cases the aetiology remains obscure but the importance of geneticfactors has been suggested on many occasions. A problem in the study ofhuman genetic vestibular defects is the lack of large monogenic pedigreesthat contain a sufficient number of affected family members to perform link age analysis. The use of animal models is an alternative to get insight inthe complex phenomenon of imbalance. We used the Epistatic circler mouse as a model for vestibular dysfunction. This mutant exists in a pro portion of the F2 generation from the cross between C57L/J and SWR/Jmice and shows circling behaviour. The results of our genome search indi cated that circling behaviour is caused by a single recessive gene derivedfrom SWR/J (the Ecs gene localised at chromosome 14) in combination with at least 3 different dominant genes derived from C57L/J (the Ecl genes localised at chromosome 3 4 and 13). This is the first dichotomousgenetic defect known to be caused by simultaneous mutations in 4 differ ent genes. Morphological examination of the inner ears of circling animalsrevealed a bilateral malformation of the lateral semicircular canal. Sincethe absence of the semicircular canals is the most specific change inpatients with CHARGE association we hypothesised that the same genesmay be responsible for the inner ear defect in the Epistatic circler as well as in these patients. Mutation analysis of Otx2 a candidate gene localised at mouse chromosome 14 is ongoing in Ecl mice and in patients with CHARGE association. ,2001
174,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease ofthe central nervous system with a probable immune mediated pathogene sis. There is good evidence supporting the hypothesis that MS is deter mined by both genetic and environmental factors but these factors remainlargely undefined. The presence of a genetic component is strongly sup ported by the high rate of concordance in monozygotic (28%) versus dizy gotic (5%) twins as well as familial recurrence risk. Linkage analysis andassociation studies have shown that susceptibility to MS is associated withthe human histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLA) class II region. Inparticular HLA DR15 shows linkage disequilibrium with MS. There is how ever as yet no convincing evidence of a common susceptibility locus. Wehave identified a unique large pedigree of Pennsylvania Dutch extraction segregating MS and showing a dominant inheritance pattern compatiblewith an autosomal mode of inheritance. In addition MS in this familyappears to be fully penetrant. We have collected and phenotypically char acterized 16 members from this family seven of whom show the typicalsigns of MS using clinical and magnetic resonance scanning (MRI) criteria. We have performed a wide genome scan and found strong suggestivelinkage to 12p12 with a maximum LOD score of 2.71 conditional on pres ence of the HLA DR15 haplotype. Our data are the first to suggest a two locus inheritance model for MS requiring both the HLA DR15 haplotypeand the additional disease locus on chromosome 12. ,2001
175,Mutations at splice sites account for up to 30% of identified mutations insome human genes. Surprisingly identical mutations in adjacent introns[e.g. in the fibrillar collagen gene COL1A1 IVS47+1G >A and IVS48+1G >A produce a mild and a lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) respectively] can have phenotypic outcomes at the opposite ends of the spectrum. To understand some of the factors that determine the outcomeof splice site mutations we examined the role of intron splice order inalmost a dozen splice site mutations in the COL1A1 COL1A2 COL3A1 and COL5A1 fibrillar collagen genes. We used intron exon primer pairs toamplify cDNA synthesized from nuclear RNA following treatment of cellsfor 5 to 40 minutes with Actinomycin D to stop new transcription andexamined the products by gel electrophoresis (32P end labeled) or afterseparation on the ABI310 (end labeled with fluorescent nucleotides) toidentify splice intermediates and to determine the relative splice order of upto 6 introns surrounding a region of known mutation. We found that in gen eral if a donor site mutation occurred in an intron that was removed rapid ly with respect to its upstream neighbor or an acceptor site mutationoccurred in an intron that was removed rapidly with respect to a down stream neighbor the outcome was an exon skip. In contrast if the samemutations occurred in introns that were spliced late with respect to theirneighbors then cryptic splice sites were used or the intron remained. Insome regions an intron was spliced along two pathways and the outcomeof mutations appeared to reflect the relative frequency of the use of thealternatives. Furthermore unexpected stability of mRNA species that con tained premature termination codons could be explained by removal ofdownstream introns prior to splicing of the intron that generated the newtermination codon. These results indicate that splice order is an importantfactor in predicting outcome of splice site mutations. Collagen genes tendto have relatively small introns and the role of splice order in predicting out come of mutations in other genes is uncertain but warrants close investi gation. ,2001
176,L1 retrotransposons are mobile DNA elements that can cause human dis ease by inserting into genes. We created a transgenic mouse model ofretrotransposition to elucidate L1 biology and to estimate the frequency ofL1 induced mutagenesis. Our transgenes contain an active human L1 ele ment tagged with an EGFP retrotransposition cassette that is under thecontrol of either the endogenous human L1 promoter or the endogenouspromoter plus the mouse RNA polymerase II large subunit promoter(pPolII). Our negative control transgenic lines contain an L1 with two mis sense mutations known to abolish retrotransposition. Using RT PCR todetect EGFP tagged L1 transcripts we demonstrated that the human L1transgene driven by its endogenous promoter was expressed at a highlevel in the mouse testis and ovary but at a very low or undetectable levelin several somatic tissues while addition of pPolII resulted in higherexpression levels in somatic tissues. RT PCR performed on pachytenespermatocytes round spermatids and condensing spermatids demon strated expression from both promoters in these cells. Importantly weobserved retrotransposition in the fractionated male germ cells of severallines by RT PCR and PCR analysis. The data suggest a rate of retrotrans position of up to 1 in 1000 sperm. We also detected individual sperm thatcontained a retrotransposition event by visualization of the EGFP marker. We did not detect retrotransposition in negative control lines by anymeans. Future work to select and isolate sperm containing new retrotrans position events may offer a novel random mutagenesis system in mouse obviating the requirement for ES cell based strategies. ,2001
177,Opitz syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized byabnormal closure of ventral midline structures. We previously identified thegene responsible for X linked Opitz syndrome MID1 and showed that itcodes for a microtubule associated protein. We now describe a specificinteraction of the MID1 protein with the a4 protein a regulatory B subunitof microtubule associated phosphatase 2A. Disruption of the PP2A a4/MID1 interaction as seen in OS patients results in a deficient ubiqui tin conjugation and a consecutive accumulation of microtubule associatedPP2A. We further show that the increased level of microtubule associatedPP2A causes a marked imbalance of the phosphorylation/dephoposphory lation pattern of microtubule associated proteins. In summary our datashow that MID1 functions as a regulator of microtubule associated proteinphosphorylation and document that PP2A is regulated by ubiquitin dependent degradation. In line with other microtubule associated phos phoproteins that play a role in genetic disorders such as lissencephalyType I and Morbus Alzheimer increased dephosphorylation of micro tubules associated proteins seems to be the key event in the pathogene sis of Opitz BBB/G syndrome. ,2001
178,Fragile X syndrome is nearly always due to a large expansion of a CGGtrinucleotide repeat in the CG rich promoter region of the fragile X mentalretardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Expansion into the full mutation range (> 200repeats) is often associated with hypermethylation and transcriptionalsilencing of the FMR1 gene. In the conventional model for fragile X clini cal involvement arises as a consequence of silencing of the FMR1 gene with the attendant loss of FMR1 protein (FMRP). However it has recentlybeen demonstrated that most males with premutation alleles or withunmethylated full mutation alleles have FMR1 mRNA levels that are high er than normal despite reduced levels of FMRP. Here we present anextension of these observations using quantitative (fluorescent) RT PCRon larger sample populations. We also demonstrate that the levels ofFMR1 mRNA are elevated in females with premutation alleles althoughmore varied than in the males and are attenuated in a manner that is con sistent with the fraction of normal alleles that are active in any given indi vidual. Finally we also observed that a fraction of males with full mutationalleles that are resistant to cleavage by methylation sensitive enzymesproduce FMR1 mRNA with some mRNA levels approaching those foundin normal individuals suggesting that the assumed relationship betweenenzyme resistance and FMR1 gene silencing may not be generally valid. Although the mechanisms leading to increased FMR1 mRNA levels are notyet understood the presence of FMRP deficits of varying extents in thepresence of elevated mRNA levels strongly suggests that reduced effi ciency of translation is mechanistically important. A defect in translationhad been observed in the full mutation range and our own observationsimply that a translational impairment may occur within the premutationrange thus the high levels of FMR1 mRNA could represent a response tothe protein deficit. Although models in which FMRP level (or level of func tion) modulates transcriptional activity remain viable other explanations forthe elevated message levels including direct (cis) effects of the CGG ele ment on transcription must also be considered. ,2001
179,Impaired ciliary and flagellar functions resulting in male infertility and recur rent respiratory tract infections are found in patients suffering from primaryciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In most cases axonemal defects were present i.e. PCD patients often lack inner and/or outer dynein arms in their spermtails and cilia supporting the hypothesis that mutations in dynein genesmay cause PCD. However until now it is unclear if mutations in dynein80 Concurrent Sessionsheavy chain genes are responsible for impaired flagellar and ciliary motili ty in mammals. To elucidate the role of the Mouse Dynein Heavy Chain 7(MDHC7) gene which encodes a component of the inner dynein arm wehave generated mice lacking this dynein heavy chain isoform. BothMDHC7+/ and MDHC7 / mice are viable and show no malformations however homozygous males produce no offspring. In comparison toMDHC7+/ mice the spermatozoa of MDHC7 / mice revealed a dramaticreduced straight line velocity and straight forward movement resulting inthe inability of MDHC7 deficient sperm to move from the uterus into theoviduct. Additionally we measured the beat frequency of tracheal cilia andobserved a decrease of the beat frequency of approximately 50% inMDHC7 / mice. The reduction in both ciliary and flagellar motility is notcorrelated with any gross defects in the axonemal structure. The pheno type of MDHC7 / mice is similar to that observed in some patients suffer ing from primary ciliary dyskinesia and our data strongly suggest that this disease could in some patients be due to mutations in the homologoushuman gene DNAH1 (HDHC7). ,2001
180,Down Syndrome (DS) or trisomy 21 is the most common autosomal aneu ploidy with a complex clinical phenotype affecting many organs and tis sues the only invariant phenotype being mental retardation. Most DS phe notypes are probably due to an extra copy of a set of normal but dosage sensitive genes on human chromosome 21 (HC21). The recently complet ed sequencing of HC21 revealed that it contains ~225 genes however itremains to be defined which are dosage sensitive. HC21 is largely syntenicwith a region of mouse chromosome 16 and thus a partial trisomy 16 Ts65Dn acts as a model of DS and shares many of the DS phenotypes. We have used Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) and filter arrayscontaining ~25 000 mouse genes and ESTs to analyse changes in geneexpression in whole brains of Ts65Dn mice. Both analyses revealed com plex changes in gene expression. Several lines of evidence suggest thatdisregulation of the signal transduction cascades of Sim2 and Dyrk(Mnbh) a transcription factor and kinase respectively are likely to beinvolved in development of DS phenotypes. To help dissect the contribu tion of the Sim2 and Dyrk to the Ts65Dn expression pattern we have over expressed their cDNAs in cell culture using adenoviral infection andanalysed induced changes in gene expression using mouse filter arrays. Acombination of these in vivo (Ts65Dn) and in vitro (Sim2 and Dyrk aden oviruses) data compared to controls should allow us to begin to decipherthe molecular cascades leading from gene triplication to the complex DSphenotype. ,2001
181,In females one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated in early embryon ic life thus making females mosaics for two cell lines. A skewed X inacti vation is a deviation from a 50 50 distribution of these two cell lines. Patients with invasive ovarian cancer were recently shown to have a high er frequency of skewed X inactivation pattern compared to patients withborderline cancer and healthy controls indicating that skewed X inactiva tion is a predisposing factor for the development of invasive ovarian can cer. We have analysed X inactivation pattern in peripheral blood from 181patients with sporadic breast cancer aged 27 90 years. X inactivation wasclassified as skewed when 90% or more of the peripheral blood cells pref erentially used one X chromosome. Ten per cent of the patients had askewed X inactivation. Since older females have a higher frequency ofskewed X inactivation in peripheral blood cells than young females youngand old patients were analysed separately. The frequency of skewed Xinactivation in 34 young patients (27 45 years) was significantly higherthan in blood donors of the same age group (12% and 2% respectively p=0.03). Among 34 old patients (73 90 years) 15% had a skewed X inac tivation. This did not differ from the frequency in a population of control females of similar age (21%). Females with a skewed X inactivation pat tern may be more susceptible to develop breast cancer due to an X linkedlow penetrance susceptibility allele that is affected by the X inactivationpattern. ,2001
182,Several predisposition loci for hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) have beensuggested (Smith et al. 1996 Berthon et al. 1998 Xu et al. 1998 Gibbset al. 1999 Berry et al. 2000). Homogeneous populations such as that ofFinland may help to reduce genetic heterogeneity that usually complicateslinkage analysis of complex diseases. Here we report results of a genome wide linkage scan in 13 multiplex Finnish HPC families selected on thebasis of linkage informativeness from a total of 292 Finnish families(Schleutker et al. 2000). On average 4 affecteds were genotyped per fam ily (range 2 6) with a mean age of 68.9 years (range 44 99 years) at diag nosis. Altogether 413 markers were analyzed with an ABI377 capillarysequencer. Two point and multipoint LOD scores were calculated for allautosomes with FASTLINK Genehunter and Genehunter Plus. The resultsshowed three chromosomal sites with two point LOD scores greater than1.5. The most promising area was at 11q with a peak two point LOD scoreof 2.85 (theta = 0.0) Genehunter HLOD of 3.28 (theta = 0.0) and NPLHLOD of 2.06 (p value = 0.0098) all based on affected only analyses. Lit tle if any evidence for linkage was found for previously discovered candi date HPC loci such as HPC1 PCAP CAPB and nan,2001
183,Germline mutations in mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MLH1 occur in the majority of HNPCC families. One of the common mechanisms of thesemutations disrupt splicing of MLH1 and MSH2 mRNA. The disruption cre ates aberrant mRNAs lacking specific coding exons (referred to here asexon skipping). Analysis of exon skipping in these genes is complicated bythe fact that the identical aberrant mRNA transcripts also occur with lowfrequency in genotipically normal subjects. These observations make it dif ficult to interpret putative MLH1 and MSH2 splicing mutations in members of HNPCC families with the high specificity necessary for molecular diag nosis. Here we report a causative exon skipping of MLH1 that underlies the pathogenesis in three unrelated HNPCC families. Sequencing studiesof RT PCR products showed an aberrant MLH1 mRNA transcript lacking exon 12 in all but two of the affected family members. The aberrant tran script produced a truncated MLH1 protein of 353 amino acids as result of frame shift and premature termination. When tumor samples from the twoaffected individuals without exon skipping were examined for genomicinstability and protein expression they showed a RER phenotype and nor mal MLH1 expression. In addition linkage analysis which previouslydemonstrated no linkage with chromosome 3 showed a lod score above 3when these two individuals were excluded from the analysis. Therefore aSSCP analysis of the genomic region including exon 12 and proximalintronic sequences was performed on PCR amplified products. All of thepatients with exon 12 skipping presented a variant conformer . The samePCR products were cloned in pSPL3 plasmid and used in an in vitro splic ing system. Introduction of exon 12 genomic sequences from the mutant Concurrent Sessions 81but not the wildtype allele of MLH1 disrupted normal exon splicing in an in vitro exon trapping system. The sequencing of both the PCR productsshowing variant conformers and clones generating abnormal splicingdemonstrated the presence of an AAG to TAG nonsense mutation at codon461 of exon 12. These results showed beyond any reasonable doubt that a) exon skipping observed in the three HNPCC families is pathogenic andis the consequence of a nonsense genomic mutation in the exon 12 b)phenocopies in HNPCC are possible and molecular typing of the tumorsarising in these families should be performed in order to correctly evaluatethe genetic risk for each family member.

184,Several susceptibility loci but few genes have been reported for humanprostate cancer. Recently Rebbeck et al. (AJHG 67 1014 2000) reportedan association of two missense variants (S217L and A541T) in theHPC2/ELAC2 gene (at 17p) with prostate cancer. They showed anincreased risk of prostate cancer for carriers of the Leu217/Thr541 geno type (OR 2.37 CI 95% 1.06 5.29) as compared with the Ser217/Ala541genotype. Here we explored the significance of HPC2/ELAC2 gene inprostate cancer causation in the genetically homogenous Finnish popula tion. The frequency of HPC2/ELAC2 gene missense variants was deter mined by RFLP in 154 unselected prostate cancer patients from the Tam pere University Hospital. The results were compared with population allelefrequencies determined from 169 blood donors from the same hospital. The results showed no increased risk of prostate cancer among theLeu217/Thr541 genotype carriers (OR 0.52 CI 95% 0.23 1.18 p=0.15).The same was true for the two variants analyzed separately. The highestrisk seen was for the genotype S217/L217 which had a tendency towardsincreased risk as compared to genotype S217/S217 (OR=1.15 CI 95%0.72 1.82 p=0.64). In conclusion current evidence does not support aprominent role for the two variants of the HPC2/ELAC2 in prostate cancercausation in the Finnish population. Extension of these studies to includeup to 430 unselected prostate cancer cases 100 familial cases 230benign prostatic hyperplasia cases and 500 population controls are inprogress. ,2001
185,Between 5 and 10 percent of breast cancer is due to inherited cancer sus ceptibility genes. Mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 account fortwo thirds of these hereditary breast cancer cases leaving one thirdunlinked. A positive family history remains a risk factor for the disease inwomen without BRCA1/2 mutations suggesting that additional susceptibil ity genes exist. Using segregation analysis families of cases withoutBRCA1/2 mutations were studied for statistical evidence of another majorbreast cancer gene. Three founder mutations account for 85% of BRCA1/2mutations in Ashkenazi Jews. Age of onset of breast cancer was analyzedin 236 families of Jewish cases from an earlier community based studywho do not carry the founder mutations. Of 602 female first degree rela tives 78 had breast cancer. Pedigrees with any ovarian cancer cases(n=17) were excluded because they are more likely to carry undetectedBRCA1 mutations. In the segregation analysis extended logistic regres sion evaluated the likelihood of various genetic and non genetic models. Sporadic (p=.004) environmental (p=.04) arbitrary and decreasingMendelian genetic models (p=.0004 and 0.04 respectively) fit the familydata poorly and were rejected. A Mendelian recessive model fit better(p=0.16) than dominant (p=.06) and co dominant models (p=.08) thoughthese three could not be rejected. The recessive model predicted that 4%of women would carry the high risk genotype and 85% of them woulddevelop breast cancer by age 70. Cumulative incidence curves predictedby the model fit observed incidence among first degree relatives. When the restriction of Mendelian transmission was lifted transmission probabilitiesstill took Mendelian values suggesting the recessive model is robust. Het erogeneity was detected between the study families and 120 BRCA1/2families from the same community based cohort implying that theobserved recessive effect is not due to undetected BRCA1/2 mutations. The relatively small family sizes and large number of cancers in relativesmay bias allele frequency and penetrance estimates upwards. To evaluatethis re analysis will be undertaken on families of all 4 700 probands whotested negative for BRCA founder mutations. If the recessive model is val idated in the larger data set it can serve as the basis for parametric link age studies to identify such a gene. ,2001
186,About 5 % of all cases of breast cancer are thought to be due to high risksusceptibility genes (BRCA1/2). However these genes explain only about15 % of the familial risk of breast cancer. Other loci for breast cancer sus ceptibility have been identified but these are not important causes of famil ial breast cancer. Therefore it is likely that low penetrance genes forbreast cancer susceptibility in the general population remain to be identi fied. In several studies chromosome 22q has been suggested as a possi ble location for a tumour suppressor gene. We are studying chromosome22 to find further evidence for a breast cancer susceptibility/risk gene andtherefore screened it for linkage disequilibrium (LD) using 18 polymorphicmicrosatellites spaced by 0.1 2 Mb. We used a set of 49 cases and 50 con trols from the late settlement area of eastern Finland. The cases and con trols were matched for age and long term area of residence and they didnot have evident family history of cancer. Significance levels for compar isons between the allele frequencies of the cases and controls were com puted by performing chi squared tests using SPSS (Fisher s exact test). Asignificant (<0.05) p value was detected with 4 markers within a region of1.1 Mb in 22q13. Our results support the possible location of a breast can cer risk gene in chromosome 22q13 although suggesting a slightly morecentromeric region than previous studies. ,2001
187," dresden.deMore than 90 private university based or other cytogenetic laboratories inGermany Austria and Switzerland (some 80% of institutions) have includ ed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) into their diagnostic services. To evaluate the quality of cytogenetic testing by FISH 27 31 35 and 29laboratories from Germany Austria and Switzerland participated in qualityassessment (QA) trials in April 1998 February 1999 September 1999 andMay 2000 respectively. One or two samples (metaphase spreads fromblood amniotic fluid or bone marrow) carrying either a normal karyotype a deletion (22q11 7q11.23 or 15q11 q12) or a supernumerary marker chro mosome were sent with the request to test them using routine protocols. Results were reviewed by committees of experts from participating labora tories. Reviewing a diagnostic FISH test is a complex process the testincludes the generation of raw data correct interpretation of data the time ly delivery of a concise written report and should be done only with genet ic counselling available. In each trial large numbers of mistakes rangingfrom inconsistencies in nomenclature (ISCN 1995) to unacceptable errorswhich could have serious consequences were identified. As a positive con sequence of the QA scheme many laboratories improved their proceduresand reports over the study period. To improve the feed back to laborato ries reviews were last performed using an assessment sheet and scoringpoints. Some participants requested specimens of rare aberrations (e.g.deletion of the CBP gene on 16p). Results demonstrate that FISH QA con tributes to the efficacy and safety of cytogenetic testing and increases theawareness for good laboratory practice. A European concerted action forquality improvement in FISH diagnosis may further benefit services. 82 Concurrent SessionsC032. A submicroscopic chromosome inversion as the basis for two macroscopic chromosome rearrangements. S. Giglio1 V. Calvari1 G. Gimelli2 T. Neumann3 L. Voullaire4 K. W. Bro man5 D. H. Ledbetter6 O.

Hopkins School of Public Health Baltimore MD United States 6University of Chicago Chicago IL United States 7University of Pavia Pavia I', 'Occurrence of de novo chromosome rearrangements has been considereda stochastic event. Alternatively one could postulate that specific genomiccharacteristics might predispose normal chromosomes to undergo unequalcrossovers leading to chromosome structural abnormalities. This hypothe sis is supported by the finding that the Xp/Yp translocation responsible forXX males and XY females preferentially occurs on the Y chromosomeshaving the Yp submicroscopic inversion that was considered a neutralpolymorphism (Jobling et al Current Biology 1998 8 1391 1394). Theinversion placing the PRKY gene in the same orientation as the homolo gous PRKX gene in Xp23.3 allows the occurrence of PRKY/PRKX recom bination and thus to the transposition of SRY from the Y to the X chro mosome. In fact it has been demonstrated that the PRKY/PRKX recombi nation accounts for the most common class of XX males and a portion ofXY females. Due to the frequency of submicroscopic genomic inversionsand duplications it seems likely that other chromosome rearrangementsarise in similar way. We demonstrate by experimental and in silico data that unequal crossovers between two olfactory receptors (OR) gene clus ters located in 8p23 at a distance of about 5 Mb are responsible for theformation of two recurrent chromosome abnormalities. The first is theinverted duplication of 8p inv dup(8p) associated with a distinct pheno type and severe mental retardation. The second is a supernumerary mark er neocentromeric chromosome +der(8)(8p23.1pter) that is also a recur rent rearrangement and is associated with minor anomalies. We demon strate that it is the reciprocal product of the inv dup(8p) thus being alwaysmediated by the two 8p OR gene clusters. Since these rearrangementsoriginate consistently in maternal meiosis (Floridia et al Am J Hum Genet1996 58 785 796 Giglio et al submitted) we investigated the maternalchromosomes 8 in nine inv dup(8p) mothers and in one +der(8) motherwith probes included between the two 8p OR gene clusters. We found thatall the mothers were heterozygous for an 8p submicroscopic inversion. Ina population of European descent the inversion was found in 19 of 72 con trols (26%) in a heterozygous state and 9 (12.5%) in a homozygous state. This inversion may cause susceptibility to unequal recombination leadingto the formation of the inv dup(8p) or to its reciprocal product the +der(8p).Two observations suggest that heterozygous females have only a low riskto have children with inv dup(8p) 1) heterozygotes are common in the pop ulation whereas the rearrangement is rare and 2) none of the more then 50inv dup(8p) subjects reported to date have sibs with the same rearrange ment. These data demonstrate that occurrence of de novo chromosomerearrangements may not be a stochastic event but is rather due to specif ic genomic polymorphisms and indicate the possibility to develop a profileof the individual risk for having children with chromosome rearrangements.

188,Subtelomeric chromosomal abnormalities are emerging as an importantcause of human genetic diseases. The scopes of this investigation were toscreen a selected group of children with idiopathic mental retardation forsubtelomeric anomalies using the multiprobe telomeric FISH method andto develop and test in the same group of patients a new assay the MAPHtelomeric assay. The new MAPH telomeric assay used the recently pub lished MAPH methodology that permits the measurement of locus copynumber by hybridization and a specifically designed set of probes locatedat the end of human chromosomes. This study showed that subtle chro mosomal abnormalities occurred with a frequency of 1.43% (1 out of 70 95% confidence interval 0.5 6.6%) in the selected group of patients usingthe multiprobe telomeric FISH method. The new MAPH telomeric assayconfirmed the same results in all normal and abnormal samples. Eventhough the prevalence of 1.43% is among the lowest found this studydemonstrated that screening for subtelomeric rearrangements is anextremely useful investigation as it appears to be one of the most common causes of idiopathic mental retardation. The new MAPH telomeric assayoffers a new fast and cost effective diagnostic tool for the investigation ofmental retardation the characterization of known chromosomal abnormal ities spontaneous recurrent miscarriages infertility hematological malig nancies preimplantation genetic diagnosis and other fields of clinical andresearch interests. ,2001
189, freiburg.deApplying flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of various Y chromoso mal DNA probes to four familial cases of human Yqs we could demonstratethat the formation of Yqs must have occured via reciprocal translocationinvolving the short arm of an acrocentric autosome and the heterochro matin of the long arm of the Y chromosome (Yqh). Breakpoints map withinYqh and the proximal short arm of an acrocentric autosome resulting in thegain of a nucleolus organizer region (NOR) including the telomere repeat(TTAGGG)n and the loss of the pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) at thelong arm of the recipient Y chromosome. In no case the reciprocal productof an acrocentric autosome with loss of the NOR and gain of PAR2 couldbe detected. Using the 15p specific classical satellite III probe D15Z1 onlyfor two of our four Yqs probands it could be shown that the satellited mate rial originated from the short arm of chromosome 15. In contrast to the lossof PAR2 in Yqs chromosomes another Y chromosomal variant (Yqh )showing deletion of long arm heterochromatin in Yq12 has retained PAR2referring to an interstitial deletion of Yq heterochromatin in such deleted Ychromosomes. ,2001
190, kiel.deThe translocation t(10 14)(q24 q11) and its variant t(7 10)(q35 q24) whichare recurrent in acute T cell leukemia lead to activation of theHOX11/TCL3 gene in chromosomal region 10q24 by juxtaposing this geneto one of the T cell receptor loci. In the present study we established adiagnostic assay for detecting these translocations by interphase fluores cence in situ hybridization (FISH). BAC clones flanking the HOX11/TCL3 locus were obtained from a fingerprinted BAC contig of chromosomalregion 10q24. BAC clones located proximal and distal of the HOX11/TCL3 locus were differently labeled and applied to interphase FISH in seven nor mal controls and eight T cell neoplasms with t(10 14)(q24 q11) ort(7 10)(q35 q24). In over 1600 nuclei of controls a considerable splitdefined as separation of each one signal for the proximal and distal probeby more than three times the signal diameter was observed in only onecell. In contrast all T cell neoplasms with t(10 14) or t(7 10) contained atleast 47% of nuclei with a signal split indicating a breakpoint in theHOX11/TCL3 locus. Thus the established double color FISH approachprovides a new reliable and routinely applicable tool for diagnosing break points in the HOX11/TCL3 locus. Supported by Deutsche Krebshilfe ,2001
191,In several developing nations in Africa and the Middle East most predom inantly in Egypt bladder cancer is one of the most common types of malig nancy in both men and women. It has several unique clinical epidemio logical and histological characteristics that suggest that it is a distinct enti ty from bladder cancer in western countries. Genetic alterations in bil harzial related bladder cancer have been studied infrequently and spe cially in the advanced sittings i.e. T3 and T4 stages. The objective of thisstudy is to extend establishing the base line cytogentic profile of this typeof malignancy to early T1 and T2 stages. For this purpose fluorescence insitu hybridization was applied to interphase nuclei of frozen stored sam ples with biotinylated repetitive DNA probes specific for all chromosomesConcurrent Sessions 83to detect numerical chromosome changes. Thirty five Egyptian patients with bladder cancer were included in this study. Eleven cases had squa mous cell carcinoma 24 with transitional cell carcinoma. Their median agewas 56 years (range 20 82 years). They were 27 males and 8 femaleswith a male female ratio of 3.3 1. Grade I tumors were diagnosed in 11cases whereas 21 and 3 cases had grade II and III lesions respectively. Data on pathologic disease stage were available for 34 cases. P1 lesionswere encountered in 24 and P2 for 10 cases. Fluorescence in situhybridization was successful in all cases studied. Most of the probes dis played a diploid spot distribution. Six out of 24 TCC cases had diploid chro mosome count with all the probes. Numerical chromosome aberrationswere detected in 18 cases (75%). In 12 cases a loss of chromosome 9was observed. In three cases an additional loss of chromosome 17 wasdetected. One case demonstrated a loss of chromosome 10 whereasanother two cases showed a gain of chromosome 7 next to a loss of chro mosome 9. Loss of chromosome Y was observed in 9 of the 27 male casesstudied (33.3%) from which one case as the only abnormality observedwhereas 4 cases were detected next to loss of chromosome 9 one casewith gain of chromosome 7. Five cases showed loss of chromosome 19whereas gain of chromosome 4 was detected in 2 cases. Two out of 11samples of SCC had normal diploid chromosome count with all the probesused. In 4 out of 11 cases (36.4%) underrepresentation of chromosome 9 compared with the other chromosomes were detected. An additional lossof chromosome 17 and gain of chromosome 7 next to loss of chromosome9 was detected in three cases. One case showed loss chromosome 17 asthe only numerical aberration. Loss of the Y chromosome was detected in3 cases of which one case was with gain of chromosome 7 and one casewith loss of chromosome 19. ,2001

Over 9/10 in USA and Ger many were women mostly married. Major findings A. Family relations. Majorities (US 75% Germany 76% France 88% ) thought warning rela tives at genetic risk takes precedence over patient confidentiality. Abouthalf (53% 42% 55%) thought spouses had automatic rights to geneticinformation without consent 44% 32% 41% favored automatic access forblood relatives. 61% 34% 45% would test children for genetic predisposi tion to Alzheimer. B. Autonomy. 60% 48% 45% said patients had a right toany service they could pay for out of pocket 69% 46% 48% thoughtrefusal was denial of rights. Most believed (86 88%) in rights to referralwithin their country but fewer (50% 29% 33%)favored it outside the coun try. Most (87% 82% 70%) approved prenatal paternity testing on requestfor a woman with 2 male friends. C. Privacy. There was universal distrustof insurers and employers but most (US 96% France 92%) would tell aschool system a diagnosis of XYY. Few (20% 11% 6%) would protect con fidentiality of a bus driver at high genetic risk for heart attack. Most favoredDNA fingerprinting for people convicted of (83 97%)or charged with (71 82%) serious crimes armed forces (60 86%) but not passport applicants(50% 10% 12%) or newborns (73% 31% 47%). D. Prevention. Majorities(64% 49% 70%) thought people should know their genetic status beforemarriage but fewer (31% 5% 29%) thought states should require carriertests. Most (80 93%) thought women at high risk should have PND butfewer (21% 43% 67%) thought they should abort if tests were positive. D. Disability. Most (78 90%) would respects parents wishes to refuse a life saving operation on a handicapped newborn. 44% 48% 77% said bringinga child with a disability into the world was unfair to the child if the birthcould be prevented 26% 27% 56% said it was socially irresponsible. 21%in US and 18% in France said laws should require sterilization for a blindwoman on welfare. About 30% fewer in US would abort for each of 24genetic conditions than in Germany. E. Preconception sex selection.26% 10% 20% would use it 15% 9% 19% thought insurance should pay. On most issues patients views differed from geneticists in their own coun try. It is time to examine reasons for these differences. ,2001
193,Genetic information about one individual may be of interest to other familymembers. When such information is relevant and important genetic coun selling clients are encouraged to make it available to these others. If pro fessionals identify blocks to communication within families they may beable to help individuals overcome them. A number of national professionalbodies and ethics panels have announced that professionals should bewilling to provide family members with such information if their relativespersist in refusing to do so and if the possible harm resulting from non dis closure is thought to outweigh the harm of forced disclosure i.e. of break ing confidentiality. We wish to challenge the framework within which sucharguments are presented on several grounds. First the concept of genet ic harm depends upon an inadequate conception of individual autonomy. Secondly the debate must be set within the context of family relationships including who counts as family patterns of communication and under standings of inheritance and of practical kinship obligations. Our work oncommunication practices with families in South Wales demonstrates thatthe understanding of disclosure can be contested and issues of disclo sure may be influenced by ideas of the personal vulnerability of particularindividuals. Both gender differences and practical barriers may also oper ate. We conclude that public policies or professional guidelines that pro mote the breaking of confidentiality or forced disclosure should be avoid ed. We need a much clearer understanding of current disclosure practiceswithin families before deciding upon such policy questions. ,2001
194,Objective To investigate knowledge of genetics and genetic tests amongDutch General Practitioners (GPs) and to determine factors influencing thisknowledge. Methods The questionnaire of Hofman et al (Acad. Med 1993 68 (8) 625 632) was translated in Dutch and adapted to the situation of thehealth care system in the Netherlands. The questionnaire was mailed to200 GPs randomly selected by the Netherlands Institute of Primary CareResearch (NIVEL) and for validation to 58 Clinical Geneticists (CGs). Nextto questions about personal and practice issues the questionnaire coveredknowledge of genetics concepts and facts and awareness of the avail ability of genetic tests. Assigning one point for each correct answer to the26 knowledge questions made a total knowledge score. Multiple linearregression was used to identify significant and independent predictors oftotal knowledge score. Results The response rate of GPs was 64%(124/195) and of CGs 84% (49/58). The total knowledge score could becomputed for 122 GPs with a mean of 16.58 (64% correct answers) nan,2001
195,Discrimination in insurance and employment on the basis of a genetic testresult for a range of genetic disorders has been reported in the USA andUK. Until recently no evidence was available of genetic discrimination inAustralia. In May 2000 an anonymous survey was sent by Barlow Stewartto genetic support groups (643) registrants on the NSW and ACT Heredi tary Bowel Cancer Register (310) and individuals (337) to determine theirneeds and experiences following a diagnosis or genetic testing one ofthese experiences included documentation of any instances of genetic dis crimination. Of the 715 respondents 43 reported discrimination in theareas of insurance and employment. In addition Keays identified 5 addi tional cases through an independent survey of clinical genetics services inAustralia. Discrimination reportedly occurred with different insurance pack ages some respondents reported being discriminated in a number of84 Concurrent Sessionsareas including refusal of life insurance denial of an increase in life insur ance for a pre existing policy refusal of income protection insurance refusal of trauma insurance reduction in superannuation and loading onthe premiums for travel insurance. Two people reported that their applica tions for positions in the Public Service and the Armed Forces respective ly were subject to a negative test result. In 3 other cases the employmentwas terminated or the subjects submitted their resignation following demo tion of duties. Following public release of this evidence of genetic discrim ination the Australian Government has initiated several enquiries to deter mine the direction for law or policy development. ,2001

197,Articles in newspapers often report new findings in medicine and their actu al or possible applications for the general audience. Prenatal diagnosis(pd) is an important application of human genetics. In a preliminary analy sis we found that the information on the methods of pd in German news papers is basically correct and thus may help people to understand thevarious procedures of pd. Therefore popular mass media may influencepublic opinion on the various procedures and on the conditions beingscreened for. In an interventional study more than 800 subjects were askedwhat they know and what they think about pd before and after reading atext written in the format of a newspaper s article dealing with the variouspd methods. This text existed in 4 different versions. Two favouring abor tion of the foetus after a positive prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome wasmade two in which a woman chose to continue pregnancy. For both alter natives the prevalences mentioned in the article were given either as per centages or as natural numbers. We found that the article influenced thereader s attitude towards the use of pd and that the different presentationsof the prevalences had an impact on the reader s understanding. Amongother aspects we found that before reading the text subjects made a (hypo thetical) choice of the methods of pd rather by default 25% of them want ed all women to make use of all the available diagnostic techniques. Afterreading the text this sub group also decided against certain techniquesthat are not necessary in all cases (e.g. amniocentesis). This study mightserve as a model for further research of the public understanding of genet ic testing. ,2001
198,WNT 4 a member of the Wnt family of locally acting secreted growth fac tors is the first signaling molecule shown to influence the sex determina tion cascade. In mice a targeted deletion of Wnt 4 causes the masculin ization of XX pups. Therefore WNT 4 the human homologue of Wnt 4 isa strong candidate for sex reversal in humans. Recently we have shownthat in testicular Sertoli and Leydig cells Wnt 4 upregulates expression ofDax1 a gene antagonizing the testis determining factor Sry. Furthermore this finding has elucidated the mechanism responsible for the human XYsex reversal associated with a duplication of 1p31 p35 encompassing theWNT 4 locus. Overexpression of WNT 4 leads to upregulation of DAX1 which redirects the fate of the developing gonad resulting in an XY femalephenotype. Thus WNT 4 a novel sex determining gene and DAX1 play aconcerted role in controlling female development and in preventing male ness. Presently transgenic studies are underway to evaluate the effects ofWNT 4 dosage on the fate of the bipotential gonad. Taken together theseobservations suggest that mammalian sex determination is sensitive todosage at multiple steps in its pathway. ,2001
199, heidelberg.deIn humans deletions of the AZFa region in the Y chromosome (proximalYq11 D3 D6) are associated with a complete germ cell aplasia (Sertoli cell only syndrome SCO) i.e. males with this interstitial Y deletion have nogerm cells in their testes tubules (Vogt et al. 1996). Therefore genes func tional for early germ cell proliferation are expected in this Y region. Up tonow two AZFa candidate genes were isolated USP9Y/DFFRY and DBY because they were found to be completely deleted in each AZFa patient(Vogt 1998). Interestingly however a point mutation in USP9Y/DFFRYresulting in a truncated protein does not result in germ cell aplasia but onlysevere oligozoospermia (Sun et al. 1999) and mature germ cells could bealso found in a patient with deletion of the complete USP9Y/DFFRY gene(Sargent et al. 1999). Similarily deletions of the complete DBY gene wereshown to be associated with different infertility phenotypes includingsevere oligozoospermia although also the SCO syndrome (Foresta et al. 2000). This suggests that deletion of only one of the two AZFa candidategenes is NOT sufficient to cause the severe SCO phenotype and the ques tion is raised as to whether at least both genes or even the whole AZFaregion must be deleted to cause in men the SCO syndrome?. We wereable to map the exact breakpoints of the AZFa region in six patients withthe SCO syndrome and estimated a length of 792 kb for the deleted Y DNA(Kamp et al. 2000). The breakpoints were found in the structure of aHuman Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV15) present with two copies at theborders of the AZFa region (HERV15yq1 HERV15yq2). This strongly indi cated that the AZFa deletion originates from an intrachromosomal recom bination event between these two retroviral elements (Kamp et al. 2000).These data were confirmed by Sun et al. (2000) and Blanco et al. (2000).HERV15yq1 is part of a complex retroviral sequence structure (DYS11)expressed in human testis tissue (Leroy et al. 1987). We therefore cur rently analyse whether its deletion in all AZFa patients points to a causalrelationship with the observed pathological AZFa phenotype. References1. Vogt P. H. et al.

200,Purpose Stargardt like macular dystrophy (STGD3 MIM 600110) andautosomal dominant macular dystrophy (adMD) are two inherited forms ofmacular degeneration characterized by decreased visual acuity macularatrophy and extensive flecks. We conducted molecular genetic study toidentify the disease gene. Methods Genetic linkage mapping and posi tional cloning approaches were employed. Results Linkage and haplotypeanalyses revealed that all affected members in four independent STGD3families and one adMD family shared a common founder haplotype. Welimited the minimum genetic region (MGR) for STGD3 and adMD to a 0.6cM interval and constructed a physical map. We characterized EST clus ters and identified a novel cone and rod photoreceptor specific gene calledElOVL4 within the MGR. ELOVL4 encodes a putative transmembrane pro tein with similarities to the ELO family of proteins involved in elongation ofvery long chain fatty acids. We found a single five base pair deletion in thecoding region of ELOVL4 which was present in every affected member ofeither STGD3 or adMD family (a total of 76 affected individuals) but absentin unaffected siblings or 300 normal controls. Conclusions We have iden tified the gene for STGD3/adMD. Biosynthesis of polyunsaturated longchain fatty acids (PUFA) in photoreceptors requires dietary consumption ofthe essential a linolenic acid and a subsequent series of three elongationsteps. We hypothesize that ELOVL4 may be involved in one or all of thethree elongation steps required for PUFA biosynthesis. Our results are thefirst to implicate the biosynthesis of PUFA in the pathogenesis of at leasttwo related forms of macular degeneration. ,2001
201,Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (TNDM) is a rare form of diabetesoccurring in 1 in 400 000 births. It presents in growth retarded neonateswithin 6 weeks of birth with persistent hyperglycaemia. Endogenous insulinlevels are extremely low or undetectable and patients usually requireexogenous insulin therapy for a median period of 3 months. The conditionis transient with recovery occurring by 18 months of age. Patients do nothave islet cell antibodies or diabetes susceptible HLA haplotypes whichsuggests a form of diabetes more akin to type 2 than to the classicalautoimmune type 1 diabetes. Although the condition is transient in earlylife about 40% of patients are known to relapse and develop type 2 dia betes later in life usually in the teenage years. A significant proportion ofTNDM cases are known to be caused by abnormalities of chromosome 6involving an imprinted locus at 6q24. We have analysed DNA from 67patients. 15(22%) have paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6 16(24%)have duplications of part of chromosome 6 including 6q24 and5(7%) have abnormal methylation of an imprinted CpG island at 6q24which forms part of the candidate TNDM gene ZAC.

203,"Venous malformations (VMs) localized defects of vascular morphogene sis are single or multiple bluish purple lesions that occur mainly in skin andmucosa. They can be dominantly inherited and are among the most fre quent lesions in centers that specialize in treatment of vascular anomalies(Vikkula et al. 1998). We previously identified the endothelial specificangiopoietin receptor TIE2/TEK located on 9p21 as the cause of muco cutaneous venous malformations (VMCM MIM 600195) (Vikkula et al. 1996). We have also shown that GVMs (MIM 138000) cutaneous venousmalformations with smooth muscle like glomus cells are linked to 1p21 22(Boon et al. 1994). In this 4 6 cM VMGLOM locus we identified linkagedisequilibrium and narrowed the region to 1.48 Mbp (Irrthum et al. 2001 in press). Herein we report on the identification of the mutated gene glo mulin localized on the basis of our YAC and PAC maps (Brouillard et al. 2000). We report the complete cDNA sequence the genomic structure ofthe gene and 13 different mutations identified in 19 families. As all but twoof the mutations cause premature stop codons GVMs are likely to becaused by loss of function of glomulin.

204,Our analysis of haplotypes consisting of 35 polymorphisms from an 8kbsegment of the dystrophin gene on Xp22 indicates that African chromo somes descend from at least two lineages that have been evolving sepa rately for a period of time. One of them underwent range expansion colo 86 Concurrent Sessionsnizing different continents including Africa where it mixed with the other one represented today by a large fraction of African specific haplotypes. While explaining the general observation of the greater diversity of sub Saharan populations this reveals a novel aspect of early human evolution before expansion. The routes of expansion outside Africa can be retracedthrough the analysis of geographic distribution of the six most frequenthaplotypes (representing more than 80% of the studied sample of 1815worldwide chromosomes). The most ubiquitous haplotype B001 is found atthe highest frequency in Eurasia and Americas. Haplotype B002 frequen cy distribution follows the southern route linking Africa South East Asia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. In contrast haplotypes B003 and B006indicate northern route connecting Europe Asia and Americas. A dra matic increase in B004 frequency in Amerindians from South and CentralAmerica and the absence of B005 from all Paleoindian and NaDene pop ulations can be associated with the colonization of Americas. Our diversitydata indicate that the dispersal of the expanding lineage was relativelyrecent (presumably in the Upper Paleolithic). They show as well that thepeopling of the World by modern humans occurred through a series offounder effects. (Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research) ,2001
205,During the course of human evolution in regions where malaria is preva lent naturally occurring genetic defense mechanisms have evolved whichprovide resistance against infection by the Plasmodium parasite. Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency resulting from mutationswithin the G6PD gene on Xq28 is the most common enzymopathy ofhumans and is thought to confer resistance against malarial infection. Three novel highly variable microsatellite polymorphisms have been iden tified within 19 kb of the G6PD gene. These microsatellites have been ana lyzed as RFLP/microsatellite haplotypes on G6PD A A and Meddeficiency as well as non deficiency chromosomes from Africa (n = 425) the Middle East (n = 135) the Mediterranean (n = 119) Europe (n = 15)and New Guinea (n = 25) in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history ofthe G6PD locus. The A/A and Med deficiency variants exist on distincthaplotype backgrounds and are in very strong linkage disequilibrium (LD)with flanking markers out to 24 kb. The pattern of haplotype variability andLD is strikingly different on chromosomes with different deficiency variants. Analysis of microsatellite diversity on A and Med chromosomes indicatesthat these G6PD deficiency mutations arose within the past 20 000 years consistent with the hypothesis that malaria has had a major impact onhumans since the introduction of agriculture.

206,Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS [MIM 270400]) is an autosomal reces sive multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation snydrome caused by mutations in the D7 sterol reductase (DHCR7 E. C.1.3.1.21) gene. Analy sis of the DHCR7 gene in 59 SLOS patients from Poland Austria Ger many and Great Britain revealed 35 different mutations some of whichwere common. Mutational spectra were significantly different across popu lations with each of the common mutations showing an east west gradient(W151X V326L) or vice versa (IVS8 1G>C). We have started to analysethe ages and origins of SLOS mutations in Europe. Using eight polymor phic sites localised in translated DHCR7 exons 12 different haplotypeswere identified among 52 SLOS chromosomes. The 10 SLOS chromo somes carrying the most common mutation IVS8 1G>C shared the samehaplotype suggesting a founder effect. This haplotype was also the mostfrequent on normal chromosomes suggesting that it is the original Euro pean haplotype. Mutations T93M and R404C which involve CpG islandswere found on 4 and 3 different haplotypes respectively suggesting thatthey are recurrent. Surprisingly W151X which is the second most frequentmutation in Europe and the most frequent in Polish SLOS patients wasdetected on 4 different haplotypes including the most frequent one. Thethree other haplotypes could be derived from the original one by only threebase substitutions. This may suggest that W151X is older than the muta tions used for haplotype constructions and is the oldest SLOS causingmutation in Europeans. The data suggest an intriguing heterogeneity of theages and origins of common DHCR7 mutations in Europe. ,2001
207,Linkage analysis in family collections has resulted in identification of multi ple potential susceptibility loci for a number of complex diseases. Resolu tion of linkage mapping is low with the confidence interval for location ofthe susceptibility gene within a linkage peak extending over regions 10Mbp or more. Association analysis using SNP markers distributed acrossthese regions has the potential for refining the disease susceptibility locusto a region encompassing only one or a small number of genes. To employthis approach we need high density maps of SNPs across the chromoso mal regions of interest high throughput genotyping methods and anunderstanding of the linkage disequilibrium between the SNP markers. Wehave identified mapped and genotyped 450 markers in a 12 Mbp regionhaving shown linkage to type 2 diabetes. The samples used for the analy ses include 92 unrelated unaffected Caucasians. We have evaluated thepair wise linkage disequilibrium between these markers. We have com pared the results across different sections of this region. We concludedthat for this region a marker spacing of 30 Kb is needed. Moreover a sig nificance level of p<0.001 identified markers in LD due to close proximity. These data allow us to begin to understand the extent of linkage disequi librium in an outbred Caucasian sample. They also help us define criteriaby which to assess the significance of results that we obtain in our associ ation studies for diabetes. ,2001
208,Sequence variants in the human genome are responsible for the geneticcomponent of disease individuality and drug response. In order to findassociations between SNPs and phenotype large sample sets need to begenotyped with high density markers. Large scale population based case control studies have been limited because neither SNP maps nor geno typing technology have been adequate to fulfill these needs yet. With chro mosome 22 fully sequenced and an SNP map constructed we have per formed genotyping on two population samples (CEPH families and Estoni ans) with 1396 SNP markers. The mean spacing of the SNPs used to con struct this map is 22kb. An oligonucleotide array with 5600 oligonucleotideswas constructed to genotype each SNP twice from both DNA strandssimultaneously using APEX technology. Allele frequencies Hardy Wein berg equilibrium and heterozygosities were calculated for each typedmarker. Software based on the EM algorithm (Arlequin) was used to cal culate the standardized disequilibrium coefficient (D ) and GOLD (Graphi cal overview linkage disequilibrium) plots were constructed. PreliminaryConcurrent Sessions 87results demonstrate that LD is not continuous and there are islands with high LD separated by low LD spots. Also the extent of significant linkageis highly dependent upon the allele frequencies of the two markers in ques tion. In principle this approach can be extended to the whole genome which makes genome wide association studies feasible. ,2001
209,In studies of complex diseases the ability to detect association betweenmarker alleles and disease depends critically on the extent of linkage dis equilibrium (LD) between disease alleles and surrounding markers. Limit ed information is available about LD in candidate genes. We performed asystematic molecular screening of the coding 5 and 3 regions of 50 can didate genes for cardiovascular diseases. The total length exploredspanned 170 kb and 228 polymorphisms were identified. Most of them(87%) were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). All polymorphismswere genotyped in 750 European subjects. The average minor allele fre quency was 0.19 Ã¢\x80\x93 0.16 not different between coding and non codingregions. However rare polymorphisms (frequency < 0.10) were more fre quently seen among non synonymous SNPs than among silent ones (54%vs 26% p=0.02) and among nondegenerate sites than among fourfold ortwofold degenerate sites (57% vs 29% p<0.05). The average pairwisestandardized LD was 0.78 Ã¢\x80\x93 0.31. The mean within gene LD varied from0.44 to 1. Across the 50 genes LD was inversely correlated with thescanned length (r = 0.51). LD was higher between alleles of low frequen cy than between common alleles (0.84 vs 0.74 p<.001). Among codingpolymorphisms LD tended to be lower when both SNPs were silent thanwhen at least one of them was non synonymous (0.78 vs 0.86 p=0.06).The variability of LD between genes and according to the type of polymor phism suggests that LD mapping of complex diseases may require adetailed study of the overall sequence variation of candidate genes. ,2001
210,Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder withmultisystemic manifestations characterised by distinctive facial features mental disability with unique cognitive and personality profiles supravalvu lar aortic stenosis and other vascular stenoses growth retardation andoccasional infantile hypercalcemia caused by haploinsufficiency for genesdeleted in chromosome band 7q11.23. The great majority of patients showa very similar ~1 6 Mb deletion that arises as a consequence of unequalcrossing over between highly homologous low copy repeat elements andincludes a number of identified genes. However with the exception of vas cular stenoses caused by haploinsufficiency for the elastin gene (ELN) theother features of WBS have not been clearly attributed to specific genes. A phenotypic map for some clinical manifestations has been proposedbased on a few atypical patients with smaller deletions and either a fullphenotype (deletion including ELN to GTF2I) or partial phenotypes (sever al deletions surrounding ELN). We have characterised clinically and mole cularly a three generation family with partial features of WBS who wereascertained due to supravalvular aortic stenosis. In addition they present ed with borderline mental functioning gregarious personality minor facialWBS features and absence of visual/spatial deficits. Molecular analysishas shown a previously unreported deletion of ~700 kb that includes allgenes from ELN to GTF2IRD1. We are currently trying to precisely definethe proximal deletion breakpoint. Along with previously reported atypicalcases our data indicate specific genes that are relevant for the cognitiveprofile and several physical features of the WBS phenotype. ,2001
211,Williams Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is a complex developmental disorder with multisystemic manifestations including e.g. supravalvular aortic steno sis (SVAS) and a characteristic cognitive phenotype. Most WBS patientshave a common microdeletion of the chromosomal region 7q11.23 but withthe exception of the elastin (ELN) gene the contribution of other genes inthe deleted region to the phenotype is unclear. One strategy to dissect thegenetic causes of WBS is to investigate individuals with small deletionsand translocations within the common deleted WBS region. We heredescribe a family with a cytogenetically balanced translocationt(7 16)(q11.23 q12.1) and an extremely variable phenotype. One femalepresented the full clinical spectrum of WBS one male needed surgicaltreatment for severe SVAS and three members of the family presentedonly with distinct features of WBS. Molecular cytogenetic molecular andDNA sequence analyses of the cloned translocation breakpoints showedthat the cytogenetic rearrangements disrupted the ELN gene locus withinintron 5 and the TM7XN1 gene locus on chromosome 16 within intron 1 inexactly the same manner in all translocation carriers. Disruption ofTM7XN1 seems to have no obvious phenotype in heterozygotes. It is obvi ous that ELN as it is deleted in all hitherto reported WBS individuals takes a central position in the pathogenesis of WBS. The most likely expla nation for the highly variable clinical phenotype in translocation carriers isa position variegation effect of the translocation breakpoint on neighbour ing genes. (HCD AD KHG and GU contributed equally). ,2001
212,Rett syndrome (RTT) is known to be an X linked neurodevelopmental dis order apparently lethal in male embryos. RTT almost exclusively affectsgirls and is in 99.5% of all cases sporadic due to de novo mutations in theMECP2 gene. Familial cases of RTT are rare and due to X chromosomalinheritance from a carrier mother. We analysed the parental origin ofMECP2 mutations in sporadic cases of RTT by linkage analysis betweenthe mutation in the MECP2 gene and intronic polymorphisms in 27 familieswith 15 different mutations and found a high predominance of paternal ori gin of mutations in 26 out of 27 cases (p<0.001). The paternal origin wasindependent of the type of mutation and was found for single baseexchanges as well as for deletions. Parental ages were not significantlyincreased in theses cases of RTT. We conclude that de novo mutations inRTT occur almost exclusively on the paternally derived X chromosomeand this is most probably the cause for the observed high female male sexratio in RTT patients. Affected males have been recently described in a fewcases of familial inheritance. We recommend that RTT should be consid ered as a possible diagnosis in boys with an appropriate phenotype. Iden tification of parental origin can be useful to distinguish the sporadic form ofRTT from a potentially familial form. This will allow geneticists to offer amore specific counselling and to discriminate between high (maternal ori gin) and low recurrence risk (paternal origin). ,2001
213,Dysferlin gene (DYSF) located on chromosome 2p13 has been identifiedas the gene responsible for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B(LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Recently our group hasdescribed a new muscular dystrophy phenotype distal anterior compart ment myopathy (DACM) caused by mutations in the same gene. LGMD2Bbegins proximally in scapular and pelvic girdles by contrast with MM inwhich the disorder begins distally in gastrocnemius muscles and withDACM characterised by onset in the anterior tibial muscles. Here wereport six dysferlinopathy patients two of them were sporadic cases. Allthe patients came from the same village Sueca (Valencia Spain) and apparently they do not present consanguinity. The study of the dysferlingene was performed using the SSCP technique and automated sequenc ing. All the patients were homozygous for the same mutation a C to T tran sition at 6086 position of the cDNA sequence (R1905X). The mutated chro mosomes shared the same 2p13 haplotype suggesting a founder effect ofthe R1905X mutation in that region. Immunocytochemical analysis of dys ferlin expression was undertaken in patients with the homozygous non 88 Concurrent Sessionssense mutation that would cause premature termination of traslation. All of them showed total absence of dysferlin. The immunohistochemical studiesusing antibodies to dystrophin and dystrophin associated glycoproteinsshowed a normal pattern. The three phenotypes LGMD2B MM andDACM were observed in this group of patients confirming the clinical vari ability of dysferlinopathies. These results also support the hypothesis thatthe DYSF gene itself is not responsible for the variability but additional fac tors must interact. ,2001
214, strasbg.frX linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a severe congenital muscular disorder characterized by generalized muscle weakness leading in mostcases to early postnatal death. Muscle biopsy reveals small rounded fiberswith centrally located nuclei resembling fetal myotubes suggesting that the disease results from an arrest in late myogenesis. We and others haverecently shown that the MTM1 gene mutated in the disorder encodes alipid phosphatase implicated in the metabolism of phosphoinositides. Inorder to understand the pathogenesis of XLMTM we have generated amouse model by deleting exon 4 in the MTM1 gene. Male knockout miceare viable and show no apparent phenotype at birth. However they mani fest a growth defect starting at around 4 weeks of age. Concominantly amuscular deficit appears in the hindlimbs and progressively generalises tothe forelimbs at around 5 6 weeks of age. KO mice present ciphosis andbecome paralysed from the hindlimbs. Death occurs at about 2 3 monthsof age probably from respiratory failure and cachexia. No clinical pheno type has been observed in heterozygous females so far. We will presentdata on the histopathological analysis of the skeletal muscle in KO mice which contains small fibers with centrally located nuclei. This model givesinsights into the pathophysiology of the disease and shows that despite itsubiquitous expression the MTM1 gene has a muscle specific function. ,2001
215, strasbg.frFriedreich ataxia (FRDA) the most common autosomal recessive ataxia associates degeneration of the large sensory neurons and spinocerebellartracts cardiomyopathy and increased incidence in diabetes. FRDA iscaused by severely reduced levels of frataxin a mitochondrial protein ofunknown function. Yeast knock out models and histological and biochem ical data from patient heart biopsies or autopsies indicate that the frataxindefect causes a specific iron sulfur protein deficiency and mitochondrialiron accumulation leading to the pathological changes. These results sug gest that frataxin has a role in controlling mitochondrial iron homeostasisand that FRDA might be caused by oxidative damage. A key tool for under standing Friedreich s ataxia pathology and for testing Friedreich s ataxiatherapeutic protocols is the availability of a mouse model that most close ly mimics the human disease. Through a conditional gene targetingapproach we have generated in parallel a striated muscle frataxin defi cient line and neuron/cardiac muscle frataxin deficient line which togetherreproduce important progressive pathophysiological and biochemical fea tures of the human disease including cardiac hypertrophy without skeletalmuscle involvement large sensory neuron dysfunction without alteration ofthe small sensory and motor neurons and deficient activities of complex es I III of the respiratory chain and of the aconitases. To better understandthe pathophysiology of the disease we have performed detailed ultra structure and biochemical studies of the cardiac phenotype. Time courseexperiments show an initial abnormal abundancy of variable size lipiddroplets in the cardiac myofibrils with the presence of giant disorganizedmitochondria. These lipid droplets disappear as the cardiac hypertrophyincreases and a compensatory proliferation of mitochondria occurs fol lowed by a progressive intra mitochondrial iron accumulation. Biochemicalexperiments reveal that the Fe S enzymes deficiencies begin in the initialphase of the pathology at around the time of lipid droplets accumulation with a gradual decrease in their activities over the course of the disease. Our models therefore allow to demonstrate time dependent intramito chondrial iron accumulation in a frataxin deficient mammal which occursafter onset of the pathology and after inactivation of the Fe S dependentenzymes. These mutant mice represent the first mammalian models toevaluate treatment strategies for the human disease. We have initiated apharmacological trial by administrating idebenone a lipid soluble antioxi dant (a coenzyme Q) already used in preliminary human clinical trials tothe striated muscle deficient mutant mouse line. We are following the clin ical course and physiology of the treated and untreated mice as well asassessing the effect of idebenone at different time point during the devel opment of the disease in order to determine its prevention efficacy. ,2001
216, net.comALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children formerly AvonLongitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood) was designed to studythe ways in which the physical and social environment interact over time with genetic variation to affect development health and behaviour in chil dren and the adults they become. 13 900 pregnant women reaching 20weeks gestation (EDD 1.4.91 Ã¢\x80\x94 31.12.92) were enrolled representingabout 85% of the eligible population around Bristol. The cohort has beenfollowed in great detail including extensive hands on assessment and clin ical testing in special clinics (www.ich.bris.ac.uk/external/html). DNA isbanked on the children mothers and some fathers and cell lines on~10 000 children and 15 000 parents will be generated over the next 5years. The central tenet of the ALSPAC approach is the hypothesis thatmost genetic influences in common disorders are conditional on the envi ronment and many gene variants will exert their main effect at particulardevelopmental stages. Early results from ALSPAC pilot studies (10% sub set) support this view. Of the first 10 candidate gene studies with collabo rators on early growth allergy and infection results support a prior hypoth esis in 5. These include associations of size at birth/early growth with INSVNTR mt16189v and ACE and between eczema and IL4R depending onearly infection or not. We believe the high hit rate with candidate geneassociation studies on just 10% of the sample reflects the precision anddetail of longitudinal outcome data and the substantial information on envi ronmental variables. Approaches about collaborations are welcome (seeweb site). ,2001
217,"Association and linkage studies have established the importance of theMajor Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in the susceptibility for MultipleSclerosis (MS). In particular association with HLA A3 B7 and DR15 wasfirst reported in patients of Northern European ancestry while an associa tion with DR3 and DR4 was reported in Sardinians. Recent genome scansconfirmed the importance of the MHC region highlighting the role of TNFaand of the DR region. Our work investigates the association between theA30B18DR3 ancestral haplotype and MS in the population of Central Sar dinia where malaria was endemic since pre historical times in low layingareas. This is an isolated population genetically distinct from others popu lations in the Mediterranean basin and characterized by high genetichomogeneity high level of inbreeding low migration high prevalence ofMS and high frequency of the A30B18DR3 haplotype. We carried out acase control study cases being MS patients and controls bone marrowdonors from the bone marrow register covering the area. Cases and con trols were serologically typed for the currently recognized HLAA B and DRantigens. We used a log linear approach to fit a wide class of models. Weovercame the complication due to the unknown gametic phase using anExpectation Maximization (EM) algorithm as estimation method. We foundthat (1) the ancestral haplotype A30B18DR3 was associated to MS afterallowing for a possible genetic stratification in cases and controls (2) DR3was conditionally independent on disease status given the A30B18 haplo type (3) there was a tendency for Odds Ratios of the high risk haplotypesto be higher in individuals originating from high past malaria prevalenceareas. Results on other ancestral haplotypes will be also presented. Concurrent Sessions 89C063. A Polymorphism in the Gene for Insulin like Growth Factor I Functional Properties and Risk for Atherosclerosisand Myocardial Infarction N. Vaessen1 A. F. C. Schut1 J. C. M. Witteman1 P. Heutink1 J.

M. van Duijn1 1Erasmus medical centre genetic epidemiology unit Rotterdam The Netherlands 2Erasmus medical centre dept. of internal medicine Rotter dam The N', 'Evidence is accumulating that low levels of insulin like growth factor I (IGF I) play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. We examinedthe role of a genetic polymorphism in the promoter region of the IGF I genein relation to circulating IGF I levels and body height and we studied therelationship of this polymorphism with atherosclerosis and myocardialinfarction. The relation between the IGF I polymorphism circulating IGF Ilevels body height and atherosclerosis was assessed in population basedsample of 900 subjects. Atherosclerosis was measured as rontgenograph ic detectable aortic calcifications atherosclerotic plaques or increased inti ma media thickness of the common carotid artery or a decreased ankle arm index. To assess the risk of myocardial infarction 477 patients withevidence for myocardial infarction at ECG and 808 controls were studied. A 192 bp allele was present in 88% of the population. Body height was onaverage 2.7 cm lower (p = 0.004) and serum IGF I concentrations were18% lower (p = 0.003) in subjects who did not carry the 192 bp allele. Although no significant association was found between the IGF I polymor phism and atherosclerosis non carriers of the 192 bp allele had anincreased risk for myocardial infarction (RR 1.7 [95% CI 1.1 2.5]). Furtheranalysis demonstrated that the risk for myocardial infarction associatedwith the absence of the 192 bp allele was almost exclusively restricted tosubjects with atherosclerosis (RR 3.4 [95 % CI 2.9 5.6). Our study sug gests that genetically determined exposure to relatively low IGF I concen trations in subjects without the 192 bp allele results in an increased riskfor myocardial infarction especially in subjects with profound atheroscle rosis.

218,Serum calcium concentration is a continuous trait maintained in a narrowrange for each individual. Genetic factors are thought to account for morethan half of the between person variability but biochemical covariates suchas serum albumin are also important. Recently we demonstrated that in asample of young caucasian healthy women the calcium sensing receptor(CASR) variant A986S exhibits a significant association with the free cal cium fraction. Since vitamin D is involved in calcium homeostasis weasked whether vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms might be co con tributing to the genetic variance of serum calcium levels. In 419 healthyToronto women 18 to 35 years old we characterized the silent Taq1 poly morphism in exon9 of the VDR gene [frequency of the variant t allele (ft) = 0.39] and the translation initiation codon polymorphism detected by Fok1digestion (ff= 0.40). We a lso characterized three CASR polymorphisms A986S (fS= 0.15) R990G (fG= 0.08) and IVS5 T 88C (fC= 0.31). Partial correlation coefficients (corrected for age weight height serum phos phate serum creatinine serum albumin and serum total globulins) showsignificant association of serum calcium with all three CASR polymor phisms A986S (r = 0.291 p = 0.0001) IVS5 T 88C (r = 0.11 p = 0.032) and R990G (r = 0.10 p = 0.050). No correlation was observed with eitherof the VDR polymorphisms Fok1 (p = 0.77) or Taq1 (p = 0.57). Theseresults confirm that variations in extracellular calcium concentrations maybe determined in part by CASR but there is no apparent contribution of theVDR polymorphisms examined here. Since other studies have suggestedthat urinary calcium excretion is determined in part by VDR (Bone1998 5 S248) it seems likely that multiple loci contribute co ordinately tothe genetic variability of calcium metabolism in humans. ,2001
219,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common paediatric can cer. Little is known about the genetic factors underlying the susceptibility tothis disease. The enzymes CYP2E1 MPO and NQO1 are involved in thebiotransformation of a variety of xenobiotics present in organic solvents tobacco smoke drugs plastic derivatives and pesticides. They also controlthe level of the oxidative stress by catalysing formation of free radicals orby protecting the cells from their deleterious effect. DNA variants in thesegenes have been associated with an increase susceptibility to differentadult cancers including haematological malignancies. To investigate therole of these loci and in particular their genetic variants as risk modifyingfactors in childhood ALL we conducted a case control study on 181 ALLpatients and 337 healthy controls both of French Canadian origin. Wefound that the carriers of the CYP2E1*5 variant were found at 2.8 fold(95% CI 1.2 6.6) higher risk of ALL and that NQO1 alleles *2 and *3 con tributed as well to the risk of ALL (OR=1.7 95%CI 1.2 2.5). No such asso ciation was found with MPO alone. However when the wild type MPOallele was considered together with the CYP2E1 and NQO1 risk elevatinggenotypes the risk of ALL was increased further (OR=5.4 95%CI 1.2 23.4) suggesting a combined effect. These findings suggest that xenobi otics metabolized by these three enzymes might be implicated in the etiol ogy of childhood ALL. ,2001
220,Carcinogens such as ionizing radiation frequently generate DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB). Two pathways are involved in their repair Thehomologous recombination (HR) and the non homologous end joining(NHEJ) pathways. HR is thought to be the major pathway for repairingsevere damage in mammals. In a British population based breast cancercase control series (~2000 cases and ~1000 controls) we are performingassociation studies by identifying and analysing polymorphisms of poten tial functional significance in genes involved in HR (NBS1 Rad52 Rad51 Rad54 XRCC2 and XRCC3) and NHEJ (Mre11 Rad50 Ku70/80 LigaseIV XRCC4). In HR we have identified a polymorphism in XRCC3 (T241M)which appears to contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer [OR(MMvs. TT) 1.3 95%CI 1.0 1.7 OR (MTvs. TT) 1.1 95%CI 0.9 1.3]. Thispolymorphism is close to an ATPase activity domain and might have func tional significance. Other polymorphisms in XRCC3 [A4541G (OR 1.1 95%CI 0.7 1.7) A17893G (OR 0.8 95%CI 0.6 1.1)] are not associatedwith a significantly increased risk. Nor are Rad51 variants [G135C (OR 0.9 95%CI 0.3 2.5) and G172T (OR 0.9 95%CI 0.7 1.2)] or C2259T(3 UTR) of Rad52 (OR 0.9 95%CI 0.7 1.1). In the NHEJ pathway Mre11 Rad50 XRCC4 and Ligase IV have been studied so far and non of thesevariants have a significant effect on breast cancer risk. We aim to definewhich genes in these pathways are most important in breast cancer riskand how they interact. ,2001
221,Objective Positional cloning of the hereditary sensory neuropathy type1.Background Hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN 1) is a familialperipheral neuropathy characterized by loss of temperature sensation ulceration and osteomyelitis of the digits and slight distal motor involve ment. HSN 1 is associated with severe loss of ganglion cells in the sacraland lumbar dorsal root ganglia as well as degeneration of the sensoryfibers in the dorsal roots. The mode of inheritance of HSN 1 is autosomaldominant with onset typically in the second or third decade. HSN 1 is a het erogeneous disease that involves at least three loci. We and others havepreviously mapped one of the defective genes to human chromosome9q22 in large informative HSN 1 families of diverse ethnic groups. We sub sequently constructed a 2.5 Mb yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contigthat spans the HSN 1 locus. Haplotype analysis of various HSN 1 families90 Concurrent Sessionsidentified the markers D9S1941 D9S197 as flanking markers of the HSN 1 locus. To help our search for the gene defect we have cloned the affect ed part of chromosome 9 in bacterial and P1 derived artificial chromo somes Design/Methods To isolate genomic clones that span the HSN 1locus we screened three genomic PAC libraries and one BAC library with45 markers that have been roughly mapped within our region of interest onchromosome 9. Information for all markers were obtained from the webpages (http //www.genome.wi.mit.edu/ http //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genemap/ http //www.shgc.stanford.edu/Mapping/rh/).We labeled DNA markers either by random oligonucleotide primer synthe sis or overgo labeling (http //informa.bio.caltech.edu/). We analyzed theexpression profile of the putative transcripts by two complementaryapproaches northern blot analysis of a set of 15 adult human tissues andamplification of the 5 end sequences by SMART RACE PCR from a selec tion of mRNA tissues including rat dorsal root ganglia. To prioritize oursearch toward the transcripts expressed in the DRG neurons we alsoscreened all candidate transcripts for expression in a rat DRG cDNAlibrary. Clones that both map within the HSN 1 contig and are expressedin DRG were the first to be analyzed for mutations. To identify overlappingcDNA clones that cover the entire transcripts we used the EST assemblymachine at Tigem (http //hercules.tigem.it). We determined the genomicstructure of novel genes by using both the unfinished and the finishedHuman Genome Sequences databases at the NCBI(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). We scrutinized the candidate genes formutations using SSCP analysis and cycle sequencing either from genom ic DNA or RNA using RT PCR. Results We have established a bacterialcontig flanked by markers D9S1841 and D9S197. This contig spans 1.6Mb. It consists of 112 clones (32 PACs and 80 BACs) and 51 markers. Wehave identified within this contig a total of 26 transcriptional units includingfour that are expressed in the DRG. Among these four three are novelgenes. We have determined the sequence of the full length transcripts determined the exon intron boundaries and analyzed the exons in ourHSN 1 patiens in these four genes. Our preliminary data suggest that onemay be defective in some HSN 1 families. Conclusions Using variousresources available through the human genome project and informativeHSN 1 families of various ethnic groups we were able to 1) map one HSN 1 gene to human chromosome 9q22 2) establish a physical and transcriptmap of the candidate region 3) precisely map 26 genes in this region including four expressed in the DRG. Preliminary screening analyses sug gest that one of these may be mutated in some HSN 1 families. ,2001
222,Patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) have two mutated copies of thegene ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and occur approximately 1 in40 000 births. In contrast heterozygous carriers for mutations in the ATMgene constitute about 1 2% of the general population. ATM protein plays akey role in cellular response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation(IR) and the maintenance of genomic integrity. Studies show AT carriersare more sensitive to IR and have increased risk for cancer compared tonormal controls. At present there is no diagnostic tool for identification ofAT carriers. Our goal is to determine a set of genes differentially expressedin normal and AT carrier cells. This molecular fingerprint could then beused to determine AT carrier status. We have used cDNA microarrays todetermine the mRNA expression level of several thousand genes in 12 ATcarrier and 12 normal lymphoblastoid cell lines. Expression profiles weregenerated for cells at baseline and after treatment with 3 Gy gamma radi ation. There were marked statistically significant differences in the expres sion level of genes at baseline and at subsequent timepoints post IR treat ment. We will present our work in determining a molecular fingerprint a setof differentially expressed genes from AT carriers and normal controls. ,2001
223,3509 SNPs were discovered and genotyped in 97 genes on Chromosome22 in 93 individuals from four broadly defined ethnic populations (African Americans Asians European Americans and Hispanic Latinos). Thesequences comprise exons and flanking intronic sequences on 22q. Theywere assigned unique locations on the chromosome by sequence com parison against the chromosome 22 reference sequence (1). The most common genotypes were defined for each gene from a set of SNPs select ed from the most variable SNPs accounting for 80% of the total SNP vari ability since these are the most informative of the major genotypes. Accordingly the number of SNPs used to define genotypes varies by geneand by population. An average of 11 distinct genotypes were observed foreach gene. The strength of association between the genotypes for eachpair of genes was evaluated primarily by the uncertainty coefficient U based on Information theory. The value of U ranges from 0 (no association)to 1 (complete association). Of the 18624 comparisons 27 were deter mined by Freeman Halton Fisher s exact test to be significant with p <0.001. Of these significant associations the average U is 0.71 indicatingthat knowledge of the genotype of one of the genes is highly informative ofthe genotype of the other gene. Possible functional mechanisms for thesestrong associations are discussed. The strength of association betweenthe different genes has also been compared with the known physical dis tances between them.

224,Completion of the draft human genomic sequence offered the best oppor tunity to date to compare genetic and physical maps. Using computersearches we identified BAC sequences which encompassed about 75% ofthe 8000 short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) on our most recentConcurrent Sessions 91comprehensive genetic maps (Broman et al. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 63 861 869 1998). Physical distances between STRPs were obtained from theGolden Path draft sequence assemblies Sept. 5 2000 version(http //genome.cse.ucsc.edu). Genetic distances were obtained from newmaps rebuilt using CEPH family genotyping data and marker order fromthe draft sequence assemblies. Recombination rates were found to varygreatly along each chromosome ranging from 0 to at least 9 cM/mb. Meanrecombination rates were 0.92 1.30 and 1.68 cM/mb for males sex aver age and females respectively. In general female and male recombinationrates varied independently of each other. Among several sequence andmarker parameters tested including G + C content density of SINEs andLINEs density of various STRs and marker heterozygosity only relativemarker position along the metacentric chromosomes in males correlatedstrongly with recombination rate. We identified several chromosomalregions up to 6 mb in length which were especially low (deserts) or high(jungles) in recombination rate. Because only 184 meioses (92 in eachsex) were used to construct the genetic maps confidence intervals for bothgenetic distances and recombination rates were relatively broad. Never theless linkage disequilibrium was much more common and extended togreater distances in the deserts compared to the jungles. Estimates ofrecombination rates for individual STRPs along with accession numbersfor overlapping BACs are available from the Marshfield web site(http //research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics). ,2001
225,Because of its highly compact genome the pufferfish has become animportant animal model in genome research. Although the small chromo some size renders chromosome analysis difficult we have establishedboth classical and molecular cytogenetics in the freshwater pufferfishTetraodon nigroviridis (TNI) which is relatively easy to obtain and to keepin aquaria. TNI as well as the Japanese pufferfish Fugu rubripes (FRU) serve as models for large scale genomic sequencing and other genomeprojects. The comparative mapping of 49 TNI specific BAC clones whichhave orthologous genes on human X chromosome and chromosome 9 onTNI chromosomes revealed remarkable differences in conservation ofchromosomal synteny in the pufferfish. 24 of 31 BACs derived from humanX chromosomal genes were distributed on only 4 different TNI chromo somes delineating 4 large segments of conserved chromosomal synteny. In contrast only 4 of 18 BACs isolated with genes from human chromo some 9 were linked in TNI. Therefore the extraordinary conservation of theX chromosome can now be extended to lower vertebrate species likepufferfish and hence seems not only due to mammalian X inactivation. Inaddition we have generated chromosome specific DNA libraries of puffer fish chromosomes by microdissection. Southern hybridization of theselibraries to gridded filters was used to identify chromosome specific genesand genomic clones to improve our first generation homology map. SinceTNI and FRU diverged only about 18 million years ago probes from onespecies can easily be hybridized on chromosomes or filters of the otherspecies. ,2001
226,Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) is caused by a deficiency of the lysosos mal enzyme ? L iduronidase. Recombinant human ? L iduronidase hasbeen studied as an enzyme replacement therapy with follow up data avail able for the first 2 years. Ten MPS I patients representing a spectrum ofseverity were treated weekly with intravenous infusions of ? L iduronidase. Liver volumes after 104 weeks of treatment were reduced 24.0% (p<0.001)from pretreatment with a range of 17.2 to 33.2%. Spleen volumes werereduced 22.1% (p<0.05) from pretreatment. At 104 weeks urinary gly cosaminoglycan excretion was decreased 72.1% (p<0.001) from pretreat ment levels compared with 62.8% (p<0.001) at 52 weeks. Modest further improvement in shoulder range of motion was observed relative to 52weeks of therapy. Improved NY Heart Association cardiac function scoreswere maintained at 104 weeks compared to 52 weeks and no significantchanges were observed on echocardiograms. In prepubertal patients height and weight increased 8.0% and 35.3% respectively over the 2years of treatment with similar growth rates at weeks 52 and 104. Hyper sensitivity reactions were the most common adverse events and urticariawas most frequent. Reactions were managed with increased premedica tions and slower infusion rates. Antibodies to the product declined with timeand clinical reactions resolved. One patient died just prior to the 104 weekevaluations due to an illness not directly related to therapy. The two yearfollow up data suggest that treatment of MPS I patients with recombinanthuman ? L iduronidase continues to be beneficial and appears safe. ,2001
227,Purpose Fabry Disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by defi ciency of the enzyme a galactosidase A. Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) theglycosphingolipid substrate of the enzyme accumulates within multiple celltypes. Deposition occurs within cardiac myocytes neurons and renalglomerular and tubular epithelial cells. Patients suffer from serious debili tating pain progressive cardiomyopathy and renal failure leading to pre mature mortality in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Methods and Materials Fifteen patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and classic Fabry Diseasewere randomised to receive 12 biweekly infusions of 0.2 mg/kg of Repla gal (human a galactosidase A) or placebo. Outcome measures focused onthe cardiomyopathy of Fabry Disease and Gb3 levels. Results There wasa statistically significant decrease in cardiac mass in the Replagal treatedpatients and an increase in cardiac mass in the placebo patients. Replagaleffected a 4.2% decrease in cardiac mass but placebo was associatedwith an 8.8% increase in cardiac mass (p=0.041). Replagal corrected themetabolic defect of Fabry Disease as measured by a 50% decrease in Gb3storage in plasma (p<0.001) and urine sediment (p=0.047). Enzyme infu sions were extremely well tolerated. Two of 7 patients (29%) developed alow titre IgG antibody response to Replagal and 1 of these patients devel oped immunological tolerance. Conclusion Therapy with Replagal wasdemonstrated to be extremely well tolerated. Therapy with Replagal hasbeen demonstrated to reverse the cardiomyopathy and correct the meta bolic defect of Fabry Disease. ,2001
228,"Gaucher disease is a rare inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzymeglucocerebrosidase which results in glucocerebroside storage in the liverand spleen haematological abnormalities and accompanying bone com plications.

We have used a tetra cycline controllable system to rescue the phenotype of the GAA ko mice byexpressing hGAAcDNA IRES EGFP either in their skeletal muscle (mck GAA/ / ) or liver (albGAA/ / ). In the two mck lines the levels of GAA activ ity in muscle were increased ~5 fold (low) and ~100 fold (high) comparedto the GAA+/ controls. These levels were sufficient to provide phenotypiccorrection locally Ã¢\x80\x94 no glycogen accumulation was observed in muscle. However systemic correction was observed only in the high expresserline. Northern RT PCR and immunoblot with anti EGFP antibody demon strated that the GAA activity detected in distant organs reflects the uptakeof the enzyme. Although the levels of GAA expression in the low express er line exceeded the levels in the wt mice the secreted protein was notdetected in circulation and glycogen accumulation in the heart was similarto that in the ko mice. No enzyme was detected in the brain in either of thetwo lines. The data indicate that intramuscular gene transfer as a treatmentfor GSDII is doubtful because of the high level of expression required forcross correction. GAA expression in liver (~100 fold increase) resulted in asignificant amount of secreted GAA and a metabolic correction of muscleand heart. Doxycycline abolished GAA expression in all the lines. Turningthe gene on at different stages of the disease will reveal if and when the disease is reversible. ",2001
229,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited X linked disordercharacterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. The disease is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene which encodes a427 kDa protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. We have been exploring the feasibility of gene therapy for DMD by devel oping viral shuttle vectors that can deliver dystrophin expression cassettesto muscle. Two key limitations to this strategy have been the size of thedystrophin cDNA (14 kb) and the immune response elicited against manyviral vectors with large cloning capacities. As a result we have developeda gutted adenoviral vector system that has a 30 kb cloning capacity and asignificantly diminished propensity to trigger a host immune response. Wehave also developed a series of mini and micro dystrophin clones that weshow display a surprisingly high functional capacity. The gutted Ad vectorhave no viral genes and are grown in packaging cell lines that express theAd proteins DNA polymerase and terminal protein. This cell line (C7) sup ports robust growth of gutted Ad vectors using helper viruses deleted forthe POL and TP genes further minimizing the immunogenicity of this sys tem. We show that gutted Ad vectors that express human dystrophin stillelicit a detectable CTL response but one that does not lead to an obviousdiminution of dystrophin expression. Vectors expressing mouse dys trophin in contrast do not display adverse consequences. Injection of themouse dystrophin gutted virus leads to a significant reduction and reversalof dystrophic pathology in dystrophic mdx mice even those more than oneyear old. We have also developed a series of small dystrophins by com bining deletions in the C terminal domain of dystrophin with deletions of therod domain. Removal of the dystrophin C terminal domain or 16 of 24spectrin like repeats has no detectable functional deficit in transgenicmice. Furthermore expression cassettes made by removal of 20 of 24repeats lead to near normal functional capacity in some clones but not inothers suggesting that not all the spectrin repeats function in a similarmanner. These microdystrophin clones are approximately 4 kb in size enabling their delivery with other genes and regulatory cassettes in guttedAd vectors or by themselves in adeno associated viral (AAV) vectors. ,2001
230, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle disease usuallycaused by frame shifting mutations in the DMD gene. A milder allelic form Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) exists in which despite a deletion orduplication of one or more exons the translational reading frame is main tained and a largely functional dystrophin protein is generated. We haveexplored an alternative strategy towards DMD gene therapy based on cor rection of the reading frame through targeted modulation of dystrophinRNA splicing. Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) directed at puta tive splicing regulatory sequences we aim to induce the specific skippingof target exons from the transcript. Recently we were able to induce exon46 skipping in mouse and human myotubes in vitro confirmed through RT PCR and sequence analysis. In muscle cells from two unrelated DMDpatients carrying one of the most frequent DMD mutations i.e. a deletionof exon 45 exon 46 skipping would restore the reading frame and inducethe synthesis of a BMD like dystrophin lacking both exons 45 and 46. Toverify this we performed immunohistochemical analyses on transfectedpatient derived myotubes. Dystrophin expression was detected at almostnormal levels in at least 75% of cells and was sustained for several days. Moreover the dystrophin signals were found at the myotube membranes suggesting a functional role of the truncated protein. Our results under score the therapeutic potential of AONs to restore dystrophin production incells from DMD patients. This strategy may be applicable not only to a vari ety of DMD mutations but also many other genetic diseases. ,2001
231,About 10% of the Greek population are heterozygous for thalassemia orHbS and prevention programmes involving prenatal diagnosis (PND) arewell established. However couples with an unsuccessful reproductive his tory may prefer to avoid terminating an ongoing pregnancy. Preimplanta tion genetic diagnosis (PGD) allows selection of unaffected IVF embryosfor transfer. To accomplish PGD for the wide spectrum of thalassemiamajor genotypes in Greece we applied an accurate reliable strategyinvolving nested PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)analysis. DGGE is an advantageous method since it allows simultaneousdetection of both alleles that contribute to the genotype minimizing risk ofmidiagnosis. Thirty two couples were counselled of whom 26 initiated 36PGD cycles. PGD was discontinued in ten cycles with <4 IVF embryos. In26 completed PGD cycles 184 embryos developed to cleavage stage andwere biopsied 72 embryos were diagnosed as unaffected and 61 weretransferred (2.3Ã¢\x80\x931.0 per cycle). From the 26 complete cycles 13 pregnan cies were established (50% success per cycle) including 11 singletons 1twin and 1 triplet (26% implantation rate for embryos transferred). The mul tiple pregnancies await CVS PND. Of the singleton pregnancies 3 awaitCVS 2 were selectively terminated (1 ectopic and 1 misdiagnosis detect ed by CVS PND) 1 miscarried in the first trimester and 5 were confirmedas unaffected with CVS PND and have resulted in the birth of full termhealthy babies. For couples with an unsuccessful reproductive history andhigh risk of transmitting a (severe) genetic disease PGD is a valuable andhighly worthwhile procedure. ,2001
232,To improve the ratio of female to male embryos in PGD for the preventionof X linked disorders we have used flow cytometric sperm separation(MicroSort) to enrich samples for X bearing sperm. Embryos created byIVF are tested for the presence of X and Y chromosome specific DNA andonly embryos determined to be female are transferred to the mother suterus. We have performed 14 IVF cycles for 12 patients with 6 different X linked disorders. Enriched X bearing sperm fractions with an average purity of 85.5% asdetermined by dual color X and Y fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to fertilize oocytes from patients. Multiplex nested polymerasechain reaction (PCR) using multiple genetic markers was used to deter mine the sex of each embryo. Of 118 embryos biopsied 94 were deter mined to be female 7 were determined to be male and 17 were of unde Concurrent Sessions 93termined gender. Among embryos where a gender assignment was possible 93% (94/101)were female. Without sperm separation one would expect roughly 50% ofembryos to be female and available for transfer. MicroSort increases theproportion of X bearing sperm as reflected in the number of embryosdetermined to be female after blastomere biopsy. This method allows cou ples undergoing PGD for X linked disease significantly more femaleembryos available on the day of transfer and may also result in one ormore frozen transfer cycles without the need for additional IVF cycles. Webelieve this data demonstrates the advantage of the use of MicroSort inPGD for X linked disorders. ,2001
233,Reliable prenatal diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) byanalysis of the dystrophin gene in fetal DNA from amniotic or chorion villi can be currently proposed in only 2/3 of the cases. In the remaining help less cases a direct dystrophin analysis in fetal sample would be highlywarranted but this protein is supposed to be exclusively expressed in mus cle and nerve cells and early in utero fetal muscle sampling is not feasi ble. In 1993 Prigojin et al (FEBS Letters 1993 335 223 230) using a verysensitive method of immuno precipitation followed by western blot analy sis found that minute amounts of dystrophin are detected in cultured cellsfrom control amniotic fluid (AF) and chorionic villus samples (CVS) where as dystrophin is not found in DMD fetuses. Using this technique in a dou ble blind study we examined cultured CVS and AF cells obtained frompregnant women from high risk families in which the defect in the dys trophin gene was already known. All 16 DMD affected fetuses were dys trophin negative and 28 out of 31 control fetal samples were positive. Theproportion of false negatives (3 out of 31) complicates the use of thismethod for prenatal diagnosis. We currently investigate the molecular andcellular basis for the unexpected expression of dystrophin in non musclefetal cells and for the phenomenon of false negative cells in order to makethe method applicable to diagnosis. ,2001
234,The paper based on a multidisciplinary European study is aimed atanalysing differences in post predictive test reproductive decision makingof carriers and non carriers and uptake for prenatal testing for HD in thecarrier group in six European countries. The study group consisted of 451persons (40% carriers and 60% non carriers) at reproductive age when thepredictive test result was given (period 1993 1998) and counseled in oneof the participating genetic centers. The testees mean age at the commu nication of the test result was 31.5 years and half of the group had one ormore pregnancies before the predictive test. Overall significantly morenon carriers than carriers had subsequent pregnancies (p<0.001). In thecarrier group refraining from further pregnancies was the most frequentlychosen option prenatal testing occurred in about two thirds of the preg nancies. A more refined analysis in the subgroup who expressed repro ductive motives in the pretest period and for whom at least three yearselapsed between the communication of the predictive test result and thelast follow up contact 39% of the carriers had subsequent pregnanciesversus 69% of the non carriers. An analysis of covariance controlling forage and number of pretest pregnancies revealed a significant impact ofthe predictive test result upon subsequent pregnancies (p<0.01). The sexof the prospective parent did not play a significant role in the carrier group. It will be concisely discussed to what extent the considerable differencesbetween countries may be due to variability in counseling approach cul tural differences legislation and other factors. ,2001
235,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder (1/500lifetime risk) affecting Caucasian young adults. Females are affectedapproximately twice as often as males. The etiology of MS is still some what of a mystery but genetic factors are recognized to be important inboth susceptibility to and the familial aggregation of the disease. Thereis no cure for MS. Current treatments are categorized either as symptomspecific (e.g. high dose steroids) or disease modifying (e.g. interferons).The possible impact of MS treatments on a developing fetus is of concernto potential parents as well as to health care practitioners. Increasingly clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors are asked to provide geneticand reproductive counselling for women (and men) who have MS and wishto have children. The purpose of this presentation is to provide a paradigmfor such counselling based on the experience at the Vancouver MultipleSclerosis Clinic. Topics to be discussed include (i) MS risks to offspring (ii) Overall pregnancy outcome do women with MS have a higher risk ofstillbirths spontaneous abortions etc. compared to age matched womenwithout MS (iii) Teratogenetic concerns with special emphasis on MS ther apies (iv) The impact of gestation and delivery on maternal MS (v) Thelongterm implications of MS on parenting. There are many factors such asMS clinical course in the woman prior to pregnancy age of MS onset etc.which can alter the information provided during a counselling session. Theinformation presented will provide guidelines on the adaption of coun selling to specific family situations. ,2001
236,We have exploited the remarkable behaviour of the DNA mismatch repairprotein MLH1 to pinpoint recombination events along the length of chro mosomes to obtain a genome wide overview of meiotic recombination(crossing over) in human females. We determined the time of appearanceof the meiosis specific pairing structures the Synaptonemal Complexes(SCs) and MLH1 foci (which we have termed RFs for recombination foci)in fetal oocytes. It was evident that such RFs are not randomly distributedalong the length of individual SCs. In addition in SCs with more than oneRF the RFs were spaced out along chromosomes indicating positive inter ference. This pattern of RF distribution in oocytes differed from that previ ously described for human spermatocytes. In particular there is a moreregular near terminal positioning of RFs in spermatocytes. Counts of RFswere performed in 95 oocytes at the pachytene stage from one fetus. Themean per oocyte was 70.3 (n=95 stdev=10.5 range=42 105) = 3 5151cM while the value for spermatocytes is 50.9 (n=46 stdev=4.4 range=41 59) = 2 545 cM. RFs appeared to be more closely spaced at early94 Concurrent Sessionszygotene in comparison to pachytene. This suggests the occurrence of an editing machinery operating during the process of maturation of exchanges which precludes close spacing. In other words there is an idi cation that cross over interference is established during the progression ofoocytes from early zygotene to pachytene. Further detailed investigations including observation on in vitro maturing oocytes should help to elucidatethe still enigmatic mechanism underlying cross over interference. ,2001
237,Recurrent pregnancy loss as a consequence of sporadic aneuploidies maysimply be a consequence of the dramatic increase of trisomic conceptionswith maternal age. However it is also possible that some couples are atincreased risk of aneuploidy as a result of gonadal mosaicism factorsaffecting chromosome structure and segregation or increased sperm ane uploidy in the male partner. We report cytogenetic and molecular findingsfor 90 spontaneous abortions (SAs) from 40 couples ascertained as hav ing two or more documented aneuploid or polyploid SAs. The mean num ber of SAs was 4.1 per couple and mean maternal age at time of aneu ploid/polyploid loss was 38 years. Overall the distribution of abnormalitiesis similar to that expected for older women with 84% due to autosomaltrisomy. The most common abnormalities observed were trisomy15(N=17) trisomy 16 (N=9) triploidy (N=9) and double trisomy (N=8). Mole cular analysis to determine origin of trisomy is so far complete for 24 SAs all of which were attributable to an error at maternal meiosis except apaternal meiotic trisomy 7 and a maternal somatic trisomy 5. These pre liminary results exclude a major paternal contribution to recurrent aneu ploidy and confirm that most is related to age related changes in thematernal ovary. However further analysis and follow up is needed to deter mine if these women have an increased predisposition to trisomy as com pared to age matched controls and if some specific trisomies (e.g. trisomy15) are over represented. ,2001
238,Chromosome instability and loss or gain of chromosomes are changescharacteristic of many tumour cells and human disorders. However themechanism of these changes has not yet been fully determined. We haverecently shown that hamster cell lines deficient in homologous recombina tion repair genes XRCC2 and XRCC3 have an elevated frequency of ane uploidy compared with wild type cells and mutant cells transfected with thehuman genes. In addition XRCC2 and XRCC3 deficient hamster cell lineshave a high frequency of mitotic cells with abnormal centrosomes andspindle formation (1). We have now examined chromosomal changes inmouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Xrcc2 / knock out mice. Dis ruption of the Xrcc2 gene in mice gives early embryonic lethality with only29% survival by day 12.5 (2). Metaphases 2hrs after tissue dissociationshowed a high frequency of chromatid breaks and exchanges in Xrcc2MEFs compared with MEFs from heterozygote and wild type litter mates. Using 3 colour FISH chromosome type aberrations were observed inXrcc2 / MEFs and these included both simple and complex types. Aneu ploidy was not detected in early passage Xrcc2 / MEF cells but sponta neously transformed Xrcc2 / MEFs at low passage were found to have avery high frequency of aneuploidy. Abnormal fragmented centrosomes andmultiple spindles were seen at high frequency in mitotic cells from trans formed Xrcc2 / MEFs compared to transformed Xrcc2+/+ MEFs. This sug gests that disruption of the mitotic apparatus in Xrcc2 deficient cells leadsto cell death in p53 competent cells but in the presence of aberrant p53 thecells rapidly become polyploid. These results demonstrate the importanceof the XRCC2 gene in preventing chromosome rearrangements and chro mosome mis segregation and reinforce the possibility that XRCC2 is atumour suppressor gene. 1.C.

239,"Commercial probes currently exist for the most common translocations inhematopoietic malignancies. However these probes often do not permitanalysis of rare breakpoints or less common aneuploidies. We developeda technique that customizes and rapidly generates single copy probes forchromosomal in situ hybridization (denoted scFISH). The locations of sin gle copy sequences are inferred from sequence analysis of final or draftgenomic sequences in specific disease intervals. Target sequence inter vals are identified by comparing the genomic sequence with a compre hensive database of repetitive sequence families. DNA fragments suitableas hybridization probes are generated by long PCR amplification of theadjacent single copy sequences purified labeled and hybridized togenomic sequences. Suppression of repetitive DNA hybridization in theprobes was unnecessary due to their single copy composition. Single ormultiple fragments were developed from each region and utilized to detectsequences in either metaphase or interphase cells. Probes were designedto detect hemizygous deletions in DiGeorge/Velocardiofacial Prader Willi Angelman and monosomy 1p36 syndromes translocations in AML M2[8 21] ALL [12 21] CML [9 22] inversion in AML M4 [16] and aneuploidyfor chromosomes 5 and 7. Probes to detect other rearrangements arebeing developed. Currently a single 2.3 kb labeled fragment has beenadequately and reliably visualized by scFISH. Mixed combinations of DNAfragments from the same contig often had but more intense hybridizationsignals on metaphase chromosomes than the same fragments hybridizedindividually. To demonstrate the feasibility of using such probes in high res olution FISH studies we examined the distribution of 2.3 kb single copysequences on the completely sequenced chromosome 22. The minimumseparation between single copy intervals is 35 bp and the maximum is 284kb with an average spacing of 22 kb. Thus it will be feasible to developcustom probes covering most of the chromosome 22 euchromatic region. If single copy sequences are similarly distributed on other chromosomes scFISH will enable more precise delineation of common or rare chromo some rearrangement breakpoints distinction of multigene family members and identification of marker chromosomes.

240,Usher syndrome type 1 is a recessive neurosensory disorder character ized by congenital profound deafness vestibular dysfunction and earlyonset retinitis pigmentosa. The USH1D locus one of six known Usher syn drome type 1 loci was mapped to chromosome 10q21 q22 (Wayne S. etal. Hum Mol Genet 5 1689 1996). This genetic linkage interval overlappedthe previously mapped nonsyndromic recessive deafness locus DFNB12(Chaib H. et al. Hum Mol Genet 5 1061 1996). We have refined theDFNB12 locus by linkage analysis of seven consanguineous families seg regating non syndromic autosomal recessive deafness. MarkersD10S1694 and D10S1737 defined a critical interval of approximately 0.55cM in a single Pakistani family. Analysis of genomic sequence from thisinterval revealed a novel cadherin like gene. Mutations in this cadherin likegene CDH23 were found in families with USH1D and in families withDFNB12. We have shown CDH23 expression in the retina by northern blotanalysis and in the cochlea by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Families with USH1D had nonsense or frameshift mutations whereas fam ilies with DFNB12 had missense mutations suggesting a genotype/phe notype correlation. We have demonstrated that allelic mutations of theCDH23 gene cause both nonsyndromic hearing loss and Usher syndrometype 1D (Bork J. M. et al. Amer J Hum Genet in press). ,2001
241,We have identified the gene responsible for the autosomal dominant dis order lymphedema distichiasis (MIM 153400). Lymphedema distichiasissyndrome classically presents as lymphedema of the limbs with variableage of onset and distichiasis or double rows of eyelashes. Other compli cations exhibiting variable expressivity include cardiac defects and cleftpalate suggesting a defect in a developmental gene with pleiotrophiceffects. We had previously mapped a translocation breakpoint in a malewith congenital lymphedema to 16q24.3. Lymphedema distichiasis wassubsequently reported to map to this region by linkage studies. By analy sis of genes flanking our translocation breakpoint we identified nonsenseand frameshift mutations in the FOXC2 (MFH 1) gene in three of threefamilies studied with lymphedema distichiasis. The translocation lies 120kb distal to FOXC2 and is believed to inactivate it by position effect. Addi tional families are currently being studied for mutations and correlation tophenotypic features. FOXC2 is a member of the forkhead/winged helixfamily of transcription factors whose members are involved in diversedevelopmental pathways. FOXC2 knockout mice display cardiovascular craniofacial and vertebral abnormalities similar to those seen in lym phedema distichiasis syndrome. Our findings show that FOXC2 haploin sufficiency results in lymphedema distichiasis syndrome. FOXC2 is thesecond known gene along with VEGFR 3 to result in a form of hereditarylymphedema. Interestingly lymphedema distichiasis is only the secondhereditary disorder known to be caused by a mutation in the forkhead genefamily whose members play pivotal roles in mammalian development. Lit tle is known about development of the lymphatic system and our findingsprovide a novel insight into this process. ,2001
242,Purpose To compare the effects of missense mutations of PITX2 orFOXC1 with the phenotypes of Axenfeld Rieger (AR) patients. Methods Five missense mutations of FOXC1 found in AR patients were introducedinto the FOXC1 gene by site directed mutagenesis. Recombinant wildtype(wt) and mutant FOXC1 proteins were expressed in COS 7 cells andassayed for their abilities to localize to the cell nucleus by immunofloures cence. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to compare theDNA binding abilities of wt and mutant FOXC1 proteins. Activation of aluciferase reporter gene was used to test the transactivation abilities of wtand mutant FOXC1 proteins. Analogous studies had previously been com pleted for PITX2 (Kozlowski and Walter Hum Mol Genet 9 2131 9 2000).Results We had previously found that the amounts of residual PITX2 func tion (as determined by nuclear localization EMSA and reporter genetransactivation) correlated with the severity of the patient phenotype inwhich the PITX2 missense mutation was found. One FOXC1 missensemutation (I87M) reduced the stability of nan,2001
243,An extensive pedigree in North West England contains multiple individualsaffected by a dominant fully penetrant but highly variable late onset degen eration of the basal ganglia which can mimic Huntington s disease (HD) butis not asociated with significant dementia. Chorea athetosis spasticity rigidity and bulbar dysfunction are described in different individu als. There is late characteristic cavitation of the basal ganglia neuroaxon al spheroids and iron accumulation. Having linked the disorder to a 2cMregion on chromosome 19 we found in a candidate gene a single baseinsertion resulting in an out of frame extension predicting protein elonga tion. Immunohistochemistry confirms massive accumulation of the geneproduct. A search through other local query HD cases revealed 5 furtherapparently unrelated cases. We have traced the family back to the 18thcentury Fletchers a border clan. There was extensive emigration in thepast. One member of that family Fletcher Christian achieved fame asleader of the Mutiny on the Bounty and founded a settlement in the Pacif ic. Mutation searching this gene will be important in atypical neurodegen erative disorders. ,2001
244,The spondylocostal dysostoses (SD) are a heterogeneous group of disor ders characterised principally by vertebral malsegmentation andmalaligned ribs. We have identified mutations in the Delta like3 (DLL3)somitogenesis gene in 7 families all showing a consistent radiological phe notype of vertebral segmentation defects throughout the spinal columnwith rib fusions and deletions. In 5 consanguineous families there ishomozygosity for DLL3 mutations. In 4 of these premature protein trunca tion is predicted from frameshift mutations 593ins5 945delAT (2 families) and 1365del17 in exons 5 7 and 8 respectively. The two 945delAT muta tion families are of Pakistani origin but geographically separated within theUK. The other consanguineous family demonstrate the missense mutationG385D in exon 8 substituting a highly conserved glycine residue withinepidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat 5. The non consanguineous familiesdemonstrate 1) compound heterozygosity for mutations C207X and1418delC in exons 5 and 8 respectively 2) heterozygosity for 593ins5 withthe second mutation yet to be identified. The geographical origins of thetwo 593ins5 mutation families are distinct and they may be independentlyoccurring mutations since this lies within a repetitive tract. We have there fore identified 6 mutations in DLL3 including 3 novel mutations(1365del17 C207X and 1418delC). All 6 mutations are located within con served extracellular domains affecting the EGF repeats. The SD pheno type is very consistent but of interest is the presence of arthrogryposis andneurological abnormalities in the 1365del17 mutation family. It is not yetknown if this is a separate recessive disorder in this family. ,2001
245,High low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels are a major risk factorfor coronary heart diseases (CHD). Genetic factors contribute greatly tohigh blood cholesterol levels. Better understanding of the factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis can lead to new targets for therapy. Here wedescribe a Syrian Druze family in which three children have high LDL lev els of 515 474 and 332 /dl respectively. The other three siblings and theparents all have LDL < 175 mg/dl suggesting an autosomal recessivemode of inheritance. A locus (ARH1) has been described earlier. The largeextended pedigree permitted us to study 66 additional persons most ofwhom have normal LDL values. Linkage to the LDLR APOB APOE andARH1 was excluded. We performed a genome wide scan in the core fam ily and found linkage to chromosomes 15 and 1. The linkage on chromo some 15 was not significant however markers on chromosome 1 revealeda multipoint LOD score of 3.05 between 1p36.1 p35.3. We have as yetfound no obvious candidate gene in the region of interest. We suggest thatthis locus contains a second gene responsible for autosomal recessivehypercholesterolemia namely ARH2 . ,2001
246,Otosclerosis is a frequent cause of hearing loss in adults caused byabnormal bone homeostasis of the otic capsule. Usually the hearing lossis conductive due to a fixation of the stapes footplate thereby preventingnormal ossicular vibration in response to sound. An additional sen sorineural hearing loss may be caused by otosclerotic damage to thecochlea. The etiology of the disease is unknown and environmental as wellas genetic factors have been implicated. Autosomal dominant inheritancewith reduced penetrance has been put forward but large families areextremely rare. To elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease identificationof the responsible genes is essential. We completed linkage analysis overthe complete genome in a Belgian family in which otosclerosis segregatesas an autosomal dominant disease. We excluded linkage to a known locuson chromosome 15 ( OTSC1 ) and found linkage on chromosome 7q with a multipoint lod score of 3.54. Analysis of key recombinants maps this oto sclerosis locus ( OTSC2 ) to a 16 cM interval on chromosome 7q34 36 between markers D7S495 and D7S2426. To investigate the importance ofOTSC1 and OTSC2 in autosomal dominant otosclerosis we recruited and analyzed 9 additional families. These families were too small to individual ly reach a significant lod score of +3 but in 2 of them suggestive linkageto OTSC2 was obtained. In the 7 remaining families OTSC1 and OTSC2 were completely excluded providing evidence for one or more additional(currently unknown) otosclerosis loci. In parallel with sensorineural hered itary hearing impairment otosclerosis is a genetically heterogeneous con dition. ,2001
247,Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited motorand sensory peripheral neuropathy. The axonal form of CMT or CMT type2 (CMT2) is clinically and genetically heterogeneous with assigned auto somal dominant loci on chromosomes 1p35 p36 (CMT2A) 3q13 q22(CMT2B) 7p14 (CMT2D) 8p21 (CMT2E). CMT2C is characterised byvocal cord paralysis but the locus is unknown. Only in CMT2E diseasecausing mutations were identified in the neurofilament light gene (NEFL).We performed clinical electrophysiological and genetic linkage studies ina single large family with autosomal dominant CMT2 from Voronezhprovince of Russia. All patients in this family have similar clinical phenotypetypical for CMT. The electrophysiological findings are characteristic foraxonal neuropathy and support the diagnosis of nan,2001
248,Hemochromatosis is a common recessive disorder in populations of cau casian origin. The disease is characterised by iron accumulation through out the body leading to widespread pathology including diabetes cardio vascular diseases stroke and cancer. A locus for juvenile hemochromato sis on chromosome 1q mutations in HFE gene (6p22.1) and a locus on7q22 have been described. Still not all hemochromatosis patients carrythese mutations. This suggests that other genes are involved. To localiseother genes involved in hemochromatosis we performed a genome searchin an extended pedigree (96 subjects) with multiple affected individuals (12patients). Affected individuals in this family did not have a known mutation. In this pedigree hemochromatosis segragates as an autosomal dominant disease. 47 subjects (10 affected and 37 unaffected) were selected for agenome wide search and linkage analysis. Simulation studies were per formed as described by Ott J (1989) and Weeks et al (1990) yielding amaximum lod score of 3.24. A genome screen was performed using 400polymorphic markers. Two point linkage analysis was performed using dis ease frequency of 0.001 and an age dependent penetrance of 2% 60%and 80%. Evidence for linkage to chromosome 2q was found with a lodscore of 3.1 at theta = 0. Haplotype sharing showed that patients share a10 cM region which include several iron metabolism genes. Fine mappingand sequencing is in progress and will indubitably leads to other gene(s)involved in hemochromatosis. ,2001
249,Myopia is a common eye disease partly influenced by hereditary factors. Itmay occur as an isolated genetic anomaly or associated with other syn dromes. We have studied a large six generation Indian pedigree with iso lated non syndromic X linked recessive form of Myopia (OMIM 310460).The degree of myopia was variable ranging from 6 to 16.5D (mean 13.33D). Fundus examination revealed myopic degeneration of all theexamined affected patients the average anterior chamber depth was3.28mm. In order to study the responsible gene linkage analysis followedby candidate region mutation screening were performed on 26 individualsincluding 9 affected and 17 normals. We genotyped multiple microsatellitemarkers covering the entire X chromosome. Marker DXYS154 which islocated in the PAR in distal Xq28 showed no recombination with the phe notype with a maximum LOD score of 3.99 at theta=0 under an autosomalrecessive model. Other Xq28 markers outside of the PAR that showed norecombination with the phenotype included DXS1108 DXS8087 andF8i13. We have subsequently decided to follow a systematic candidategene approach in the linkage interval in order to identify the myopia caus ing gene. Four genes (HSPRY3 SYBL1 IL9R and CXYorf1) have beenidentified in the PAR (which spans <500kb). We have screened the SYBL1and HSPRY3 for mutations by amplification and sequencing of codingexons and flanking intronic sequences. No significant variants were foundin patients implying that these two genes are not associated with thesevere form of X linked myopia. Analysis of the remaining genes in the PAR region is in progress. ,2001
250,Asperger syndrome (AS) was first described in 1944 by a Viennese physi cian Hans Asperger who reported a group of boys with autistic psychopathy whose clinical features resembled autism with some modifications. Itis characterised by difficulties in social interaction and stereotyped behav iour but in contrast to infantile autism by normal intelligence and usuallynormal language skills. In the pediatric age group the prevalence ofAsperger syndrome is around 4 7/1000 whereas the corresponding figurefor the infantile autism is 4/10000. Etiopathogenesis is unknown but thereis evidence for a strong genetic component. Based on clinical observationsAS is inherited in the same families as infantile autism but also as a sepa rate entity often transmitted from male to male. We report the analysis of13 candidate gene loci associated with autism and schizophrenia in 17Finnish AS families with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Linkageto the previously reported predisposing loci for autism could not be repli cated with Finnish AS families. By contrast evidence for linkage wasobtained on 1q21 22 the region that has previously been linked to schizo phrenia (Brzustowicz et al. 2000) with the maximum two point lod score of2.70 with marker D1S484. Two families shared a common haplotype with in an 8.6 cM region between markers D1S2721 and D1S484. Our resultssuggest that AS and schizophrenia may have common genetic back ground. ,2001
251,"Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a MCA/MR syndrome due to muta tion of the 3ÃÂ§ hydroxysterol Ã\x98 7 reductase gene ( DHCR7 ) which causes impaired reduction of 7 dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to cholesterol. We pro duced a mouse model of SLOS by disruption of Dhcr7 in mouse embryon ic stem cells. Similar to infants with SLOS Dhcr / pups demonstrated growth failure dysmorphic craniofacial features decreased movement and feeding problems. Craniofacial anomalies included cleft palate (9%)and nasal plug retention (39%). Mutant pups also appear to havedecreased mineralization of bone. Mutant pups did not spontaneouslyfeed had an uncoordinated suck and aspirated formula when hand fed. Biochemically this mouse model is similar to the human syndrome. 3ÃÂ§ hydroxysterol Ã\x98 7 reductase activity in mutant fibroblasts was 0.3Ã¢\x80\x930.15% of control levels. Tissue sterol profiles showed decreased cholesterol andincreased 7DHC levels in Dhcr / pups. In brain tissue Dhcr / embryos also had decreased levels of desmosterol and increased levels of 7 dehy drodesmosterol (7DHD). Neurophysiological testing showed that corticalneurons from Dhcr / pups exhibited a normal sodium current were able to generate an action potential in response to a depolarizing current andresponded to GABA. In contrast Dhcr / cortical neurons showed minimal ( 4.9 pA) or no response to glutamate stimulation (0 pA 25% 11 pA 75%).The control glutamate response was 39 pA ( 21 pA 25% 67 pA 75% p<0.001). Both Western Blot and RT PCR analysis confirmed expressionof glutamate receptor subunits in cortex from Dhcr / pups. Thus we pos tulate that this impaired glutamate response is due to receptor dysfunctionas a consequence of the substitution of 7DHC and 7DHD for cholesteroland desmosterol in neuronal plasma membranes. Glutamate receptor dys function is associated with impaired suckling thus potentially explainingthis aspect of the mutant phenotype. Neurological dysfunction includinghypotonia mental retardation and behavioral problems are frequent clini cal findings in SLOS. Perturbation of neurotransmitter function may under lie these problems. This mouse model will be useful in determining the bio chemical and neurophysiological basis of the behavioral and learning prob lems seen in this MCA/MR syndrome as well as testing therapeutic inter ventions.98 Concurrent SessionsC104.

Sterol levels were lowbecause activity of the rate controlling enzyme for sterol biosynthesis microsomal 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) was reduced 10 fold in liver (10Ã¢\x80\x938 vs. 101Ã¢\x80\x9375 pmol/min/mg protein p<0.02) and 3 fold in brain (169Ã¢\x80\x9392 vs. 500Ã¢\x80\x93230 pmol/min/mg p<0.05) in / compared to +/+ mice. The reasons for low HMGR activity were two fold. High concentrations of 7DHC in microsomal membranes (1) preventedincreased expression of HMGR and other genes important for CH metab olism that is usually triggered by low CH levels and (2) increased the rateof HMGR protein degradation 3 fold. We propose that inhibition of totalsterol synthesis in SLOS may exacerbate developmental abnormalities especially in children with mutations which leave some DHCR7 activity and suggest that prenatal therapy which raises maternal plasma CH levelsmight be useful in such cases.

252," ', ' wuerzburg.deCathepsins B and L are ubiquitously expressed cysteine proteases impli cated in intracellular proteolysis and extracellular matrix remodeling by invitro studies. Gene targeting has not yet validated these functions in vivo. Cathepsin B null mice show no overt phenotype. Cathepsin L deficientmice present with mild abnormalities in the T cell compartment and recur rent hair loss. In striking contrast we here show that the combined defi ciency of cathepsins B and L leads to death at the end of the second weekof life. Only double mutant mice develop a dramatic brain pathology includ ing massive neuron death and brain atrophy thus far unprecedented inmice. This neurodegeneration is preceded by the occurrence of variousvariants of autophagic abnormalities in neuronal cell bodies dendrites andaxons. Biochemical analyses of the vacuolar system suggest a defect invesicle maturation in cathepsin B / L / mice. Since the role of theautophagosomal/endosomal lysosomal system in neurodegeneration andaging is not well understood cathepsin B / L / mice provide an excitingmodel to study the basic pathogenetic mechanisms.

253,Homocystinuria can be caused by deficiency of 5 10 methylenetetrahydro folate reductase (MTHFR) which is required for folate dependent homo cysteine remethylation. We recently generated MTHFR deficient mice(mthfr / ) which are a good model for homocystinuria. To address thera py we placed female mthfr +/ mice on oral betaine before mating to mthfr+/ males until weaning of offspring. Betaine is an alternate methyl donorfor homocysteine remethylation through betaine homocysteine methyl transferase (BHMT). Survival and growth of pups were monitored andcompared to a control group. We also performed studies in adult mice ofthe three mthfr genotypes. An unsupplemented diet or diets supplementedwith betaine or dimethylsulfoniumpropionate (DMSP a betaine analogue)were administered for 14 days. Plasma metabolites and liver BHMT activ ity were determined. Liver histology was evaluated in mthfr / mice. RESULTS Survival rate (14.9%) and weight gain of mthfr / pups fromuntreated mothers were significantly lower than those from betaine sup plemented mothers (70.2% survival). In the study of adult mice betaineand DMSP lowered homocysteine levels significantly by >50% in all geno type groups. Mthfr / mice on control and DMSP diets had fatty livers those with betaine did not. Plasma betaine levels increased with betaine but not DMSP supplementation. BHMT activity was unchanged. CON CLUSION In mthfr / mice betaine significantly improves survival growth and hepatic morphology. Betaine and DMSP reduce homocysteine in miceof all three genotypes but DMSP supplementation is associated withbetaine depletion and fatty liver. In summary betaine is a reasonablemethyl donor when folate dependent remethylation is compromised. ,2001
254, heidelberg.deHepatic production of ketone bodies during fasting periods requires mito chondrial 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl (HMG )CoA synthase. A genetic defi ciency of this enzyme has been previously reported in two children withhypoketotic hypoglycaemic coma but enzymatic confirmation was not pos sible and molecular studies were not performed. We report the clinical biochemical and molecular findings in two other children with HMG CoAsynthase deficiency. Both suffered from acute hypoketotic hypoglycaemiccoma during a febrile infection with prolonged fasting in infancy. There wasno other specific organ dysfunction. Urinary organic acids showed a char acteristic metabolite pattern reflecting a fasting state but without evidenceof ketogenesis. Acylcarnitines were consistently normal an important diag nostic feature that distinguishes the disorder from beta oxidation defects. Molecular studies in the first patient revealed compound heterozygosity formutations G212R and R500H in the HMGCS2 gene G212R was alsoidentified in the second patient. Neither mutation was detected on 200 con trol chromosomes. Further analyses including expression studies are inprogress. With avoidance of prolonged fasting periods the children aredeveloping normally. HMG CoA synthase deficiency is the only known dis order that exclusively affects mitochondrial ketogenesis explaining boththe clinical features as well as the characteristic biochemical findings. ,2001
255,We have observed that while many ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency(OTCD) females exhibit little dietary protein sensitivity they may be moresensitive to intercurrent stress including fasting trauma or infection. Ourprevious observation that OTCD females maintain a relatively normal rateof total urea synthesis but derive less of this urea from glutamine impliesthat other sources of nitrogen are more important to nitrogen homeostasisin these individuals (Lee et al 2000). We hypothesize that nitrogen con taining compounds generated from the intestinal catabolism of dietaryConcurrent Sessions 99amino acids are the most important source of ureagenesis in OTCD females. We have previously used stable isotopes to correlate in vivo urea cycle activity with clinical severity in null and partial activity urea cyclepatients and controls. Using these methods we have now tested whetherintestinally generated ammonia is a more effective precursor for urea syn thesis than peripherally generated glutamine. By administering 15N ammo nium chloride (15NH4Cl) either intravenously or enterally with a simultane ous I. V. infusion of 18O/13C urea we measured the efficiency of 15N trans fer from a nitrogen source into urea in 6 OTCD females and 6 controls. Interestingly the utilization of enteral 15NH4Cl was similar between OTCD and control subjects. In contrast OTCD females utilized peripheral 15NH4Cl less efficiently at a rate of 46% that of controls suggesting that OTCD females rely more on enteral precursors as the most improtantsource of ureagenesis. These approaches represent an important tool tooptimize the nutritional management of urea cycle patients especially dur ing critical illness or catabolic states. Posters ,2001
256, hamburg.deWe have discovered an unique intronless gene located at 17q21 in theregion of BRCA1 gene encompassing a protein of only 30 amino acids. Mutation analysis of this gene was preformed in blood and tumor tissue of50 patients with sporadic breast cancer by employing SSCP and directsequencing. No mutations were found. The expression of this gene waslooked at mRNA and protein level. The gene is normally not expressed orexpressed at a very low level in serum cultured fibroblasts and breast tis sue of normal females. A comparatively three to four times higher expres sion of mRNA was noted in the tumor tissue of the patient by northern andRTPCR techniques . ELISA tests were developed to monitor the expres sion of this protein and presence of an antibody to it in sera and other tis sues including fibroblast and tumor tissue cell cultures . An investigation ofa large sample of the patient sera has revealed that this protein isexpressed at considerable level in sera of patients and also antibodyagainst this protein can be traced in the sera of patients with breast can cer. In about 7% of normal controls the values in range of the affectedpatients were also observed. This assay promises a good potential hopeto develop a preclinical test and therapeutics for sporadic breast cancer. This protein contains a strong homology to BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene andcan be predicted to block the sulfatation of BRCA1 protein and glycosyla tion of BRCA2 protein and thus prevent their proper maturation and func tioning. ,2001
257,The ability of human endogenous retroviruses to retrotranspose has led tothe hypothesis that their expression may have a role in carcinogenesis 1person in 8 may carry an endogenous insertional mutation due to a newretrotransposition event. HERV expression has been identified in a num ber of malignancies including breast and colon cancer. Transcription ofHERV K the biologically most active HERV family can be up regulated bysteroid hormones in the breast cancer cell line T47D. Prostate cancer likebreast cancer is sensitive to its hormonal environment raising the possi bility of similar regulation of HERV K expression. RNA was extracted fromprostate cancer cell lines DU 145 PC3 and LNCaP 16 prostate cancerand 9 benign prostatic hyperplasia specimens and subjected to RT PCR. A modified RT PCR technique was developed to specifically amplifyexpressed HERV K without amplifying genomic HERV sequences. South ern hybridisation and DNA sequencing confirmed the results. HERV Kenvelope expression was identified in the cell lines. Statistically significantHERV K expression was detected in prostate cancer [10/16 (63%) cancerspecimens compared to 1/9 (11%) benign specimens (p=0.03 2 tailedFisher s exact test)]. These results suggest that HERV K expression isgenerally silenced in benign tissue but does occur in prostate cancer. Expressed HERVs may act as mobile genetic elements with the potentialto disrupt the function of tumour suppressor genes or enhance expressionof proto oncogenes via promoter activity in the Long Terminal Repeats(LTRs) of the viral sequence. Assessment of HERV K sequences expressed in the presence of testosterone is currently being investigated. ,2001

Suchgenetic instability arising from mutations in cell cycle checkpoint or DNArepair genes enables the cells uncontrolled proliferation. The past severalyears research has resulted in defining new agents participating in cell pro liferation and contributed to the fact that we have started to understand thecell cycle machinery. Molecules involves in basic pathway of cell divisionare cyclins the positive regulators of cell cycle which overexpression isassociated with uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. In our research weexamined the level of cyclin genes expression in bone marrow samplesfrom patients with acute leukemia before the therapy. For the detection ofcyclin mRNA we used The Multi Probe RNase Protection Assay System(RiboQuant). We analyzed the expression of cyclin of G0/G1 G1 G1/Scell cycle phases. The results we obtained shows the leukemic cells revealsignificantly high levels of cyclin D3 and cyclin I mRNA as well as slightlyhigher cyclin G1 gene expression than other cyclins.

260,Nm23 gene was originally identified by differential hybridisation of K 1735melanoma cell line clones of varying metastatic potential. A tumor metas tases suppressor function was implicated by the reduced expression ofnm23 in highly metastatic sublines compared with non metastatic sublinesderived from the same K 1735 clone. The purpose of this study was toevaluate whether the expression of the nm23 H1 protein or loss of het erozygosity (LOH) of the nm23 H1 gene is associated with tumor stageand grade of tumor differentiation. We also investigated the correlation ofnm23 H1 expression with 5 year survival. Paraffin tissue sections wereanalyzed immunohistochemically using monoclonal antibody NM301 tohuman nm23 H1 protein. DNAs (normal and tumor) isolated from microdis sections of parafin sections were used for LOH analysis. Of 102 adeno carcinomas that were examined 41% showed a weak positive immunos taining for nm23 H1 protein. The most nm23 H1 positive tumors were inDukes B (67%) and in the w ell differentiated tumors (65%). Statistical analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in sur vival between the patients with nm23 H1 positive tumors and patients withtumors that were not stained for nm23 H1 protein. To analyze LOH at thenm23 H1 gene we used VNTR marker located in untranslated 5 region ofthe nm23 H1 gene. At this nm23 H1 locus 60% of samples were informa tive and 33% of them demonstrated LOH. The nm23 H1 LOH was morefrequent in tumors that were larger than 5 cm than in smaller ones. Posi tive correlation was found between the nm23 H1 LOH and histologicalgrade as well as between the nm23 H1 LOH and Dukes stage of tumorsamples. ,2001
261,The promyelocytic leukemia protein PML was first identified in the break point region of the t(15q 17q) translocation in acute promyelocyticleukemia (APL). We and others have previously reported that PML couldfunction as a tumor suppressor. Its introduction into a number of cancercell lines including the breast and prostate resulted in the inhibition of theirgrowth in vitro and their tumorigenicity in nude mice. When brought to thepromoter by a DNA binding domain the PML protein was found to functionas transcription inhibitor. A number of natural promoters including the epi dermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) gene promoter and the dihydrofolatereuductase (DHFR) promoter which both are involved in cellular growth were found to respond to the PML s inhibitory effects. Here we haveanalysed the effects of PML on the EGFR gene promoter and expression. Our data show that PML s repression of the EGFR promoter is caused byinhibition of the Sp1 dependent activity of the promoter. On functionalanalysis the repressive effect of PML was mapped to a 150 bp element(relative to the ATG initiation site) of the EGFR promoter. In vitro and in vivoanylsis by means of the glutathione S transferase (GST) pull down assay coimmunoperecipitation and transient transfection assays demonstratedthat PML and Sp1 are associated. Furthermore overexpression of PML inA431 cells which express high level of EGFR protein resulted in signifi cant repression of EGFR expression. Together these data show that PMLinhibits the expression of the EGFR by affecting its promoter. Since EGFRis overexpressed in a number of malignancies such as the breast cancerand head and neck carcinomas PML could be considered as a potentialagent in gene therapy of these cancers. ,2001
262,Recent evidence points toward the involvement of genetic alterations suchas p16 or p53 in the switching on of angiogenic phenotypes in the tumortissue. This study examines the inhibitory effect of BAI1 and SMAD4 geneson the onset of angiogenesis and invasion in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Using adenoviral mediated transfer the expression of these genes wererestored in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover p53 transfection in thesecells induced BAI1 expression. While no significant in vitro antiproliferativeeffect could be achieved the in vivo growth of these cells in NK depletedSCID mice was strongly inhibited due to the antiangiogenic properties ofthese genes both subcutaneously and in dorsal skin chamber. It wasfound that the effect was related at least in part to the implication of thesegenes in the regulation of the proteolytic balance namely the matrix met alloproteinases expression. The expression of endothelial cell mitogensVEGF and bFGF was not significantly changed by restoring the presenceof these genes and is generally low in the pancreatic adenocarcinoma celllines that were used. It was rather the down regulation of ETS 1 a tran scription factor largely involved in angiogenesis by the SMAD4 gene thatappear to account for the reduced vascularity and invasiveness of thetransfected tumor cells. Gaining molecular understanding of the processesassociated with growth invasion and metastasis in pancreatic malignan cies is crucial as their poor prognosis emphasizes the need for newapproaches among which the antiangiogenic therapy is highly promising. ,2001
263,We have isolated a human and murine homolog of the Drosophila prunegene through dbEST searches 1 4. PRUNE protein retains the four char acteristic domains of DHH phosphoesterases 2. The homo or hemizygousprune mutant is lethal in the presence of just a single copy of a gain of function mutation in the abnormal wing disc gene (awd) dubbed Killer of Prune (awdK pn) which dies at the third larval instar stage developingmelanotic tumors. By using interaction mating and in vitro and in vivoco immunoprecipitation experiments we show the ability of humanPRUNE to interact with the human homolog of awd protein (nm23 H1) 3 4and nm23 H2 and demonstrated that it is impaired with nm 23 H1 S120Gmutant a gain of function mutation associated with advanced neuroblas toma. PRUNE is a new phospodiesterase (PDE) specific for cAMP sub strate and is amplified (3 6 copies) in 89% of Sarcoma tumors analysed. Furthermore we have found a dominant negative PRUNE mutation (with apartial loss of function) affecting mice skin hair follicle cellular proliferation. Our working hypothesis is that PRUNE is negative regulating the anti metastatic function of nm23 protein. Results will be presented. REFERENCES 1. Banfi S. et al.

264,Abstract In an attempt to determine the susceptibility of spermatocytes tomalignant transformation by simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen(TAg) transgenic mice harboring a chimeric gene composed of the SV40TAg gene fused to the 1.4 kb promoter sequence of the human phospho glycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) gene were generated. Previously it was shownthat this regulatory sequence is able to direct the expression of a CATreporter gene in male germ cells with the onset of expression in sperma tocytes of transgenic mice. Northern blot analysis of RNA from different tis sues indicated a specific transcription of TAg in testis of PGK2 TAg trans genic mice. RT PCR analysis on RNAs and Western blot analysis on pro teins isolated from testis at different stages of development revealed thattranscription and translation of the TAg gene starts in 12 day old testis which is in accordance with the onset of endogenous Pgk2 expression andcoincides with the appearance of preleptotene spermatocytes. PGK2 TAgtransgenic mice are fertile and show no tendency toward transformation. However prepubertal 18 day old transgenic male mice exhibited a signifi cant increase in spermatocyte number but no differences in number of Ser toli cells as compared to wildtype mice. With proceeding age the increasedamount of spermatocytes in prepubertal transgenic mice assimilates tothat of wildtype mice. Tunel assays revealed a higher rate of apoptosis intestis of prepubertal transgenic mice compared to that of wildtype mice. This indicates that the excessive spermatocytes in prepubertal transgenicmice undergo apoptosis during spermatogenesis. ,2001
265,The bombesin like peptides (BLP) have a variety of properties includingappetite suppression and growth promotion of respiratory epithelial cellsand lung cancer that are relevant to tobacco addiction and carcinogene sis. Several studies in humans and experimental animals have demon strated that tobacco smoking or nicotine treatment is correlated withincreases in levels of BLP. Furthermore tobacco smoking is associatedwith expression of one bombesin receptor subtype the gastrin releasingpeptide receptor especially in females. We have found that longtermsmokers with elevated urinary BLP levels are significantly more likely tohave either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer than arelongterm smokers with low urinary BLP levels. In addition there is a neg ative correlation between urinary BLP and body weight. However the largedegree of variation in urinary BLP levels that is found in either smokers ornonsmokers makes correlation with susceptibility to tobacco induced lung disease difficult. In order to determine whether variation in urinary BLP lev els is partly genetically determined we measured urinary BLP (expressedas fmol/mg creatinine) in a population selected for lack of environmentalfactors particularly tobacco smoke exposure that might influence levels. We studied 105 healthy individuals from 80 families taking no medica tions between 18 45 years of age with less than 100 cigarettes/lifetime and with no history of parental smoking or exposure to passive smoke athome or in the workplace. Data were analyzed using the S. A.G. E. REGCand NOCOM programs. A trimodal distribution is the best fit for the data with a bimodal distribution marginally less likely (p < 0.03) and a unimodaldistribution highly unlikley (p < 0.00001). Thus the data are most consis tent with genetic determination of variability in BLP excretion most likelyas a result of variation in a codominant fashion at a single locus. In this twoallele model three subtypes (LL mean 188 fm/mg creat HL mean 383fm/mg creat HH mean 635 fm/mg creat) would occur with gene frequen cies of 0.866 for L and 0.134 for H. Observed genotype frequencies agreewell with those predicted by the Hardy Weinberg equation. In 20 individu als multiple urinary BLP determinations were made subtype reproducibil ity was 95%. Analysis of 25 sib pairs demonstrated a heritability of approx imately 80% based on an intraclass correlation of 0.42. This suggests thatit should be feasible to map the locus responsible for variation in BLPexcretion in humans using standard linkage strategies. Elevated levels ofanother growth factor IGF1 have been associated with increased risk forbreast prostate and lung cancer however the contribution of genetic vari ation to IGF1 levels is not known. Genetic variation in urinary BLP excre tion may contribute to susceptibility to the tobacco induced lung diseaseschronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer and may affectalterations in body weight associated with tobacco smoking. ,2001
266,The SA Clinical Genetics Service provides a general genetic counsellingservice a Familial Cancer Service and hosts the Familial Cancer Registryand research studies. We need prompt access to the records of over30 000 clients and relatives. The overlapping roles within the Servicedemand that we have a single database but the diversity of roles dictatesthat one interface cannot meet the needs of all users. The core of our data base is the client server implementation of Progeny Enterprise a com bined database and pedigree drawing program. The flexible nature ofProgeny allowed us to develop and readily modify the database and thepedigree interface has been invaluable in reviewing families. However Progeny s flexibility means that the interface is not very user friendly andthe lack of a tight database structure limits the data export and reportingformats. We have developed a non graphical interface KinTrakDB thataccesses a standard sub set of the Progeny fields. This meets our require ments for clinic and record management. KinTrakDB also supports cancerregistry functions. Other database fields can be readily defined andaccessed using the Progeny interface. The combination of different clientinterfaces represents a cost effective means of providing tailored inter faces to the one database. The principle could be readily applied in otherclinical settings. ,2001
267,As the study of cancer genes DNA markers and molecular technologiesworked their way from the research laboratories to the clinic many geneti cists now find themselves attending tumor conferences. This brings theopportunity and challenges of offering new technologies to help solve long standing clinical dilemmas. Following are just two examples of many situ ations. A 40 year old male heavy smoker with tongue cancer diagnosedtwo years previously. The aggressive malignancy was seemingly treatedsuccessfully with extensive surgery. After two years of remission a med ical examination showed a lung lesion. If the lung lesion was a metastasis the prognosis would be poor. If the lung lesion was a new primary a sur gical cure would be possible. The geneticist present at the conference sug gested that molecular studies might assist this differential. FISH study ofHER 2/neu c myc cyclin D centromeres 8 11 and 17 showed completeconcurrence suggesting a metastasis. A 53 year old women was present ed regarding planned lumpectomy to remove a small breast lesion. Duringthe presentation the surgeon casually added that a sister had breast can cer at age 42 and that the patient was Ashkenazi Jewish. The geneticistsuggested gene predisposition testing citing that recent studies favor con sideration of less conservative surgery in the presence of BRCA1/2 muta tions. Molecular genetics is proving to be of great value in the basic under standing of the etiology progression and prognosis of certain cancers. Weare now finding that this technology will have an important use in assistingin the surgical and medical management decisions. ,2001
268,Patients with germ line mutations in cancer predisposition genes are atmarkedly increased risk of developing cancer. Furthermore having devel 102 Posters: Cancer Geneticsoped cancer once does not preclude the development of further primaries. The early symptoms of cancer may be subtle or masquerade as benign disease. It is essential for nurses caring for such patients to have an under standing of cancer in order to realise the significance of symptoms thatmay seem non threatening to the patient. This paper describes three dif ferent case scenarios of families where urgent referral was expedited fol lowing incidental reported symptoms during telephone follow up calls fromthe nurse counsellor. Currently with the changing knowledge related togene carriers and their risks of other primaries other health professionalsare not necessarily aware of the implications for such cases. At the RoyalMarsden Hospital in London UK an annual follow up gene carrier clinichas been set up and this clinic acts as a gate keeping clinic for such fam ilies. This is staffed by a multidisciplinary team and both the nursing andmedical staff have in depth oncological as well as genetic training. Theclinic has an open door policy via the clinical nurse specialist who is avail able by telephone to answer patient s queries. The clinic team liases close ly with other practice specialists tailoring these contacts to the patient sneeds. We propose that gene carriers are followed up in such Carrier Clin ics to provide up to date information and recommendations for manage ment of these high risk individuals. ,2001
269,The positive familial history is a major risk factor for common cancer. Wepresent preliminary results of the first clinical trial on familial cancer aimedat building a familial cancer register and introducing genetic testing andcounseling in the affected families. In 1999 the 2045 new patients withcancer regardless the localization received a questionnaire on family his tory. The family history was considered as positive for the patients with atleast one affected first degree relative. The overall prevalence of positivefamily history was 8.06% (165 patients). Family history was positive espe cially for the common types of cancers 12.98% for breast cancer 18.49%for colorectal cancer 19.04% for endometrial cancer and 10.76% for ovar ian cancer. We found families with clinical criteria suggestive for somehereditary cancer syndromes 6 families with HNPCC (Amsterdam II crite ria) 5 families suggestive for Li Fraumeni syndrome and 6 families withstrong arguments for breast ovarian cancer syndrome. Also we found 16families with strong history but without any pattern suggesting one specif ic entity. Moreover we have recorded 7.81% lung cancer patients with pos itive family history frequently nonsmokers and 7.98% positive history forcervical cancer patients. In conclusion the overall prevalence of positivefamily history we have found is similar with the data in the literature. Thesehigh prevalence underlines the necessity of the set up of genetic testing infamilial cancer in Romania. Future investigations are necessary for lungand cervical cancer due to the possibility of a special genetic risk factor. ,2001
270,Alterations in genes involved in cell cycle regulation are common in manytumor types. Abnormalities in the CDK4 and p53 genes which regulatetransition through G1 phase of the cell cycle have been implicated in theprogression of diverse types of cancer. The general goal of p53 appears tobe the prevention of cell propagation if mutations are present. The p53 pro tein acts as a transcription factor by binding to certain specific genes andregulating their expression. The function of p53 can be suppressed byanother gene MDM2 which is overexpressed in certain tumorigenic cellsand binds to p53 protein thus inhibiting its transcriptional activation func tion. Since in different tumours MDM2 amplification involves ampliconsencompassing flanking genes such as CDK4 this gene could act as analternative or additional gene involved in the transformation mechanism. Toevaluate the involvement of G1 G2/M alterations in the chemical tumori genesis the status of these genes or gene products and cell cycle phaseswere examined. The genetic alterations were analysed by mutation analy sis fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single cell gel elec trophoresis (comet assay). Analysis of flow cytometry showed changes inboth the G0/G1 phase and G2/M phase checkpoints. We detected G2/Marrest and apoptosis in Hep 2 cell line in response to the treatment withthe mycotoxin nan,2001
271,The present study reports for the first time natural mutations in Pyruvatekinase (PK) M2 isozymic form responsible for the regulation of theenzyme activity. The PK enzyme activity showed down regulation in the B lymphoblastoid cells established from two Bloom syndrome patients BS1 BS3 by 50% and 90% respectively and by 75% in the freshly obtainedPHA stimulated lymphocytes of a BS patient diagnosed for the first time inIndia. An analysis of the critical domains of the PK M gene in BS cells resulted in the observation of different mutations in exon 10 which codesfor the inter sub unit contact domain (ISCD) region of the PK M2 protein. Apart from these mutations few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)were observed in this region of the gene both in normal and BS cells whichdid not affect the enzyme activity. Modelling studies of each of the PK M2protein with a mutation was suggestive of a changed interaction betweentwo domains within a sub unit in BS1 a gross structural change in BS3 anda changed interaction between two sub units of the tetramer in the BSpatient. The presence of mutations in PK M2 ISCD region and its correla tion with the downregulated enzyme activity in the Bloom syndrome cellshas opened the possibility of looking at this gene in more details in futurein the background of a variety of pleiotropic phenotypic features observedin this syndrome. ,2001
272,The Receptor Tyrosine Protein Kinases (RTPK) have been shown to playa crucial role in radio induced signaling response in rat spleen lympho Posters: Cancer Genetics 103cytes. The 2 fold increase of its tyrosine kinase domain activity under the influence of X ray irradiation in dose of 1 Gy has been established. How ever we have also determined a partial reduction of cytokine stimulatingaction on RTPK activity in conditions of irradiation. To clarify a reason ofRTPK hyper activation we have carried out partial purification procedureswith using the antiphosphotyrosine antibodies and then valued theautophosphorylation rate of this enzyme by autoradiography and kineticanalysis. These data reveal the significant increase of RTPK autophos phorylation degree under the influence of X ray irradiation in dose of 1 Gy. Furthermore the studies performed by us earlier testify to disruptions onthe level of enzyme substrate association under the influence of X ray irra diation. Obviously the above mentioned disruptions could result in alter ation of downstream signaling pathways which include activation of dis tinct Protein kinases. As a result of examination of intracellular Proteinkinases activities (cAMP cGMP Ca2+/phoshpolipid and Calmodulin dependent Protein kinases) after spleenocytes stimulation by cytokine wehave observed a significant increase of cAMP dependent protein kinaseactivity in control conditions while it has been reduced under the influenceof X ray irradiation in 1 Gy. After performed researches we suggest thatcytosolic cAMP dependent Protein kinase participates in radio inducedsignal transduction pathways through RTPK in rat spleen lymphocytes andit is accompanied by tyrosine kinase domain hyperautophosphorylation. Thus RTPK are involved in radiation induced response of immune com petent spleen cells and mediate the effects of cytokines signal transductionin these cells in 12 hours after rat s irradiation in dose of 1 Gy. Ourresearches suggest that X ray induced disorders of RTPK functioning arecaused by qualitative alteration of this enzyme and in the future need to beproved by checking of RTPK expression level in spleen lymphocytes aswell as gene targeting which will show important clues about the functionof RTPKs. ,2001
273,Telomerase a ribonucleoprotein complex plays an important role in themaintenance of telomeres in eucaryotic cells. The telomerase is found innormal somatic cells during the entire embryogenesis but later on only instem cells germ cells and activated lymphocytes. An abnormal activationof the enzyme can result in an indefinite proliferation and immortalizationof the cell. In more than 80% of malignant tumours telomerase activity hasbeen shown. Till now the TRAP assay (Telomeric Repeat AmplificationProtocol) has been a common tool for activation analysis but it is not suit able for quantification. This problem can be overcome by quantification oftelomerase specific RNAs using real time PCR. Therefore we quantifiedthe functional RNA (human telomerase associated RNA hTR) and themRNA of the catalytic subunit (human telomerase reverse transkriptase hTERT) of telomerase using real time PCR. For wich a new primer systemfor the detection of both telomerase units was established. Isolated RNAwas used from tumour cell lines (COLO 230 SK MEL) normal cell line (G 292) and blood as control. By comparing hTR and hTERT it was possibleto detect differences in the expression between normal and tumour cells. In all the cell lines and the blood the functional RNA of telomerase wasconstitutively expressed at least on a low level. A high level of hTERT wasonly detected in COLO320 whereas in SK MEL and the normal cell linethe expression was low. In the blood sample we found no hTERT at all. Weconclude that this newly established system for differential quantification ofhTR and hTERT offers the opportunity to distinguish between expressionprofiles of normal and tumour cells and to define a cut off value for cellularmalignity. ,2001
274,Reactivation of telomerase is believed to play an important role in immor talization and carcinogenesis. Despite criticism on etiopathological signifi cance of telomerase in carcinogenesis evaluation of telomerase expres sion and activity may be considered to be a potentially useful diagnosticmarker. Telomerase expression has been studied by RT PCR using specif ic primers for telomerase reverse trancriptase. Telomerase repeat amplifi cation protocol TRAP (qualitative TRAPEZE telomerase detection kit Inter gen and quantitative TeloTAGGG telomerase PCR ELISA Roche) wasused for analysis telomerase activity. In a preliminary study high expressionof telomerase in gastric and colon cancer has been found. Lymphocytesstimulated by PHA also showed high telomerase expression. Low telom erase expression has been found only in some cases of non cancerousmucosa from corresponding patients with gastric and colorectal cancerand peripheral blood lymphocytes. Telomerase activity in 10 000 cells hasbeen observed in all studied samples. 300 cells lysate of all cancer cells as well as PHA stimulated lymphocytes showed telomerase activity in con trary to normal cells. On the basis of obtained results it can be concludedthat all cancer cells tested have higher telomerase expression as com pared to normal cells. Taking into account clear cut relationship of telom erase activity and cell number it can be postulated that quantitative orsemiquantitative evaluation of telomerase activity and expression shouldallow to distinguish cancer from normal tissue. ,2001
275,Defects in mismatch repair (MMR) genes result in an accumulation ofmutations in tumours reflected as microsatellite instability (MSI). Germlinemutations in MMR genes predispose to hereditary cancer and have beenfound first and in particular in families with (non polyposis) colorectal can cer (HNPCC). Occurrence of MSI is used as a criterion for mutation analy sis of MMR genes. The tighter the definition of familial CRC the higher theprobability to find mutations in particular in MSH2 and nan,2001
276,We report an analysis of two polymorphisms in the HPC2/ELAC2 gene inmultiplex prostate cancer (CaP) sibships and matched controls. Two mis sense variants have been reported to be associated with CaP S217L andA540T in a sample of 359 CaP cases and 266 matched controls (Rebbecket al. 2000). The association was due to a significant increase of the 540Tvariant in the CaP cases compared to controls. The 540T variant was incomplete linkage disequilibrium with the 217L variant. We genotyped these polymorphisms in 257 multiplex CaP sibships and355 matched controls. The control subjects have been followed for yearsas part of a large PSA study. All are free of CaP and none have ever reg istered a PSA level >2.5 ng/ml. All subjects in this study are of Europeanancestry. The frequency of the 540T allele in our CaP cases is significantly greaterthan in the control series (0.051 vs. 0.021 p < 0.01). We also observe com plete linkage disequilibrium between these two variants. Among the 281multiplex sibships 40 were found to contain at least one sibling carryingthe 540T allele. All were heterozygous. The Table reports a nonsignificantdifference in the observed and expected distribution of affected sib pairs(ASP) and affected trios with respect to 540T. Additionally the 540T carriers did not differ from noncarriers in their mean Gleason score (p=0.84) nor in their mean age of onset (p=0.45). ,2001
277, ulm.deProstate cancer is a complex disease with an estimated portion of 10 %familial cases caused by rarely mutated susceptibility genes. Recent link age analyses have revealed at least five loci expected to harbour high riskalleles. In a candidate gene approach concerning the susceptibility locusPCaP (1q42.2 43) which was identified in a French and German popula tion we focused on the PCTA 1 gene encoding a member of the tumorassociated galectin family. Selected on the base of cosegregation 36 Ger man and French prostate cancer sibships were examined by EnzymaticMutation Detection (EMD). In 77 affected men no mutations were foundwithin the coding sequence of the PCTA 1 gene while in three affectedbrothers an intronic insertion upstream exon 6 was observed. In vitroinvestigations have been worked out to address a putative influence onsplicing. In addition the detection of three amino acid alterations (19Y/F 36C/R and 184S/R) tempted us to evaluate frequent PCTA 1 alleles asputative low penetrance factors to predispose for prostate cancer. In anassociation analysis of 73 German sporadic cases versus 73 controls aheterozygous state with the haplotype 19F 36R 184S was found signifi cantly overrepresented in sporadics and became even more prominentafter stratification according Gleason scores higher than 6 (odds ratio =5.3 p=0.022). However in comparable French cases and controls thesephenomena have not been recovered. Since general implications of PCTA 1 in malignancy and metastasis have been suggested but not yet assessedin detail we started to search for interacting proteins using the two hybridsystem. ,2001
278,Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is a syndrome char acterised by familial predisposition to colorectal carcinoma and extra colonic cancers. This dominant disorder is caused by germline mutationsin one of at least five mismatch repair genes viz. hMLH1 hMSH2 hPMS1 hPMS2 and hMSH6. Mutations in the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes accountfor 80 90% of HNPCC cases. The frequency of HNPCC among SouthAfrican colorectal cancer subjects has not yet been determined. The pur pose of this report is to estimate the frequency of HNPCC amongst indi viduals diagnosed with generic colorectal cancer excluding FAP under thePosters: Cancer Genetics 105 Sibship configuration Observed Expected ASP T/A T/A 10 11.55 T/A A/A 23 21.45 Trios T/A T/A A/A 3 3.52 T/A A/A A/A 4 3.48age of 45 years. In this study the entire coding region of the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes were screened using single stranded conformational poly morphism analysis and DNA sequencing in 100 subjects. Ten biologicallysignificant mutations were detected. These mutations were not detected in50 unrelated unaffected control individuals tested. Genetic tests facilitatethe molecular diagnosis of the disorder in sporadic cases and this aids inthe identification of other asymptomatic family members. The resultsobtained in this study will allow us to determine the frequency of colorectalcancer due to HNPCC in South Africa. Ethically there is a commitment togenealogical tracings and investigation of familiality of HNPCC mutationcarriers. Ideally recruitment of family members for genetic testing andcounselling where appropriate amounts to commitment of vast humanand other resources for this purpose. The capacity to do this in a develop ing country on a sustainable basis may be used as an indicator for estab lishing other gene based diagnoses . ,2001
279,Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myleoproliferative disordercharacterized by increased proliferation of megakaryocytes and elevatedplatelet counts. While ET usually occurs sporadically we have identified arare family with at least 5 affected individuals in two generations. Sinceplatelet production is regulated by thrombopoetin (THPO) through itsreceptor MPL the respective genes were considered likely candidates forthe underlying genetic defect segregating in this family. The pedigree wasconsistent with linkage to THPO but MPL was excluded by linkage analy sis. Elevated levels of THPO in affected individuals strongly supported thepossibility of a mutation in the THPO gene that resulted in increasedexpression. Three similar families have been reported to have mutationsin the 5 untranslated region of the full length THPO mRNA that were asso ciated with loss of translational inhibition of THPO mRNA. Therefore weare sequencing the corresponding genomic region in affected family mem bers. ,2001
280,Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive disorderassociated with high susceptibility to lymphoid malignancies. More than90% of all patients known so far are of slavic origin and carry the samefounder mutation. Its population frequency was estimated at 1 130 in theCzech Republic. The aim of the present study was to calculate the poten tial cancer risk of NBS heterozygotes. In a cohort study histories weretaken of 181 persons from 18 pedigrees in a personal interview using astructured questionnaire covering reproductive history X ray history work ing place history and current and former health status as well as possibleconfounding factors of life style. For 176 participants the genotype hasbeen determined (85 heterozygotes and 91 normal homozygotes). Amongthe homozygous probands 2 cases of cancer were found while 8 carcino mas were detected in the heterozygous (all 8 were of different type aver age age of onset 62 years). This elevated risk of malignancies in the het erozygotes is also obvious in the pedigrees for those members for whichthe probability of heterozygosity has been estimated by conventional cal culations only. Already in 1990 an increased incidence of cancer amongstrelatives of NBS patients has been noted (E. Seemanova Mutat Res. 238 321). Here we present the first direct evidence for this assumption. ,2001
281,In our recent cancer registry based study the incidence of gastric carcino ma was increased up to 5 fold in male relatives of early onset prostate can cer patients. This association may reflect the influence of genetic factors predisposing to both tumor types. Germline mutations of the CDH1 geneat 16q have recently been associated with familial gastric cancer. Further more two genome wide linkage studies of prostate cancer recently report ed positivity at 16q. We therefore identified families and individual patientswith both gastric and prostate cancer and investigated whether the CDH1gene mutations would be involved in cancer predisposition in these cases. Fifteen of the 180 Finnish hereditary prostate cancer families (8.3%) hadone or more gastric cancer cases. No truncating or splice site CDH1 muta tions were identified by PCR SSCP in these families or in eight individualpatients who had both prostate and gastric cancer. However a novelS270A missense mutation in exon 6 of the CDH1 gene was seen in a sin gle family with 4 prostate and 2 gastric cancers. A large scale population based survey indicated a higher prevalence of S270A among both familialprostate cancer cases (3.3% n=120 p=0.01) as well as in unselectedprostate cancer patients (1.5% n=472 p=0.12) as compared with blooddonors serving as population controls (0.5% n=923). We conclude thatindividual rare mutations and polymorphisms in the CDH1 gene such asthe S270A may contribute to the onset of prostate cancer and warrant fur ther investigations in other populations. CDH1 gene does not however appear to explain the link between prostate and gastric cancer. ,2001
282,Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) is a syndrome character ized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pheochromocytoma sometimes combined with parathyroid adenomas. Penetrance is almostcomplete but gene expression is variable. We have available DNA from124 unselected consecutively patientes submitted to reject or confirm thefamilial character of the disease. These patients were divided in twogroups. The first included 105 patients with al least MTC with or withoutfamiliar history. In the second group we included 19 patients with onlyphaeochromocytoma. By sequencing analysis we studied in all patients the 6 mainly involved exons of the ret protooncogen independently of ageof onset. From 105 patients with at least MTC 30 had familial history of the disease and 93.3% of them presented germline mutations in ret. Amongthe 75 non familial cases only 7% showed germline mutations. In patientswith only pheochromocytoma 21% of cases presented germline mutationseither in ret or in vhl gene. We were looking in both groups for a correla tion between mutation the patient s age and the clinical variables. Withregard to patients who presented germline mutations in ret the most strik ing result was the wide age distribution of non symptomatic carriers of non 106 Posters: Cancer Genetics634 mutation versus the clustering noted within the 634 mutation carriers. On the other hand in patients with only pheochromocytoma there was noclear association between the presence or absence of germline mutationand the factors that we considered (bilateral or unilateral character andfamilial history of the disease). ,2001
283,Germline mutations in the p53 gene account for 70% of Li Fraumeni fami lies and 30% of families with Li Fraumeni like (LFL) cancer syndrome. Thecell cycle check point kinases Chk1 and Chk2 act upstream of p53 in DNAdamage responses. Recently a germline mutation in hCHK2 gene wasreported in a LFS family (Bell et al Science 286 2528 1999). We haveanalyzed p53 hCHK1 and hCHK2 genes for mutations in 45 Finnish fam ilies with LFS LFL or phenotypically suggestive of LFS with conformationsensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE). Genomic sequence comparisonswere carried out to ensure specificity in the analysis of hCHK2 exons 10 14 with multiple homologous sequencies in the genome. Five different dis ease causing mutations were observed in seven families (15.6%) five inthe p53 (11.1%) and two in the hCHK2 gene (4.4%). No mutations in thehCHK1 gene were identified. The p53 mutations (Pro151Thr Arg196Stop Arg 213Stop Arg248Gln in two families) were found in the conserved mutation rich exons 5 7. Two p53 families had a LFS phenotype (total 3LFS families) and two LFL phenotype and one was a family history nega tive patient with both childhood sarcoma and early onset breast cancer. Inthe hCHK2 gene a frameshift mutation in exon ten (1100delC) was foundin two families final analysis of two other sequence variants is currentlyunderway. The cancer phenotype in the1100delC families was not typical ly LFS or LFL and may indicate variable phenotypic expression in the rarefamilies with hCHK2 mutations. Still other genes may account for theremaining LFS/LFL families. ,2001
284,Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorderaffecting neural crest cell derivatives and resulting in cutaneous manifes tations of caf au lait patches and neurofibromas. It is characterised by awide variety of phenotypes even in the same family. In order to correlatethe genotypes with their phenotypes and to find the functions of neurofi bromin we have characterised a number of mutations from NF1 patientsby Southern blots and a protein truncation test. A new mutation consistingof a G to A transition at position +1 of the 5 splice site of exon 12a causesthe loss of both exons 11 and 12a without affecting the reading frame ofthe mutant mRNA. Transfection of HeLa cells with portion of the mutantand the wild type genes cloned in DUP4 1 vector derivatives and in vitrosplicing assays using chimeric mutant or wild type adenovirus/NF1 pre mRNAs indicate the mutation prevents the definition of exon 12a aprocess that is normally required to activate the weak 3 splice site of exon12a. Because the mutation affects exon 12a definition exon11/exon 12asplicing is also compromised leading to the exclusion of both exons 11 and12a. Thus these results provide strong support for the 1995 model of exondefinition as proposed by Berget and suggest an important role for exons11 and 12a in the activity of neurofibromin. ,2001
285,Peutz Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterizedby mucocunateous pigmentation hamartomatous polyps and an increasedrisk of associated malignancies. Colon and breast cancers are the mostfrequent malignancies but also genital and small intestine cancers arefound. The LKB1/STK11 serine/threonine kinase is mutated in Peutz Jeghers syndrome and functions as a tumour suppressor. There are how ever many families with PJS without mutations in LKB1 suggesting locusheterogeneity in this disorder. We have studied the molecular etiology in 20PJS families and identified 10 independent LKB1 mutations (a differentone in each family). The spectrum of mutation includes missense and non sense amino acid substitutions deletions insertions a complexdeletion/insertion and splice site mutations. Most of the LKB1 mutationsresult in truncated protein and/or disrupt the protein kinase catalyticdomain leading to inactivation or a dramatic decrease of the kinase activi ty. The clinical features of affected individuals (N=105) of the 10 PJS fam ilies without a LKB1 mutations do not differ from PJS patients (N=204) withsuch mutations. Affected individuals from 5 out of 10 families with LKB1mutations had developed cancers. Similarly affecteds from 4 out of 10 PJSfamilies without recognizable LKB1 mutations developed cancers. Finally there was no significant correlation between the different mutations inLKB1 and the presence or absence of cancer although the sample size issmall for meaningful conclusions. ,2001
286,STK11/LKB1 codifies for a ser thr kinase whose function is still unknown. Germline STK11/LKB1 mutations can be found in about 50% of Peutz Jeghers(PJ) patients. Somatic STK11/LKB1 mutations have be found in asmall number of sporadic tumors of lung ovary skin colon. The wild typeSTK11/LKB1 protein shows a nuclear as well as cytoplasmic localizationand an autocatalitic activity. Linkage studies in PJ families seem indicatethe existence of an other locus on the long arm of the chromosome 19. Inthe last three years we collected 18 cases of PJS. At least another affect ed member was present in the family of 6 patients the remaining 12 caseswere sporadic. Germline mutations of STK11/LKB1 gene were found in 4sporadic and 4 familial cases in addition several different exonic an intron ic polymorphisms were identified. Of relevant interest are amutation(IVS2+1A >G) involving the non canonic consensus sequencelying in the splicing junction of the exon 2 and a change (IVS5+5A >G) inthe intron 5 . The splicing effects of these two changes have been evalu ated in COS 7 cells transfected with a pSPL3 plasmid in which the exonicsequences and the flanking intronic regions were cloned. In addition wehave identified several mRNA isoforms products of alternative splicing. The sequencing of two of these isoforms revealed the presence of two dif ferent out of frame deletions from the exon 2 to 7. This work was partiallysupported by AIRC and MURST COFIN 98. ,2001
287,Peutz Jegher s syndrome (PJS OMIM 175200) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hamartomatous polyps and mucocutaneous pig mentation. There is an increased risk for developing various neoplasmswith predisposition to benign and malignant tumors of the gastrointestinaltract breast ovary uterine cervix and testis. Mutations in the serine/thre onine kinase STK11 / LKB1 cause Peutz Jeghers syndrome in most ofaffected individuals. However a number of PJS patients show no muta tions in STK11 / LKB1 suggesting genetic heterogeneity. One large PJS family has previously been described with significant evidence for linkageto a second potential PJS disease locus on 19q13.3 13.4. Mutation analy sis of STK11 / LKB1 in the affected members of this family revealed nomutations which supported the likelihood for the existence of a yet notidentified second PJS gene in this region. In the current study we used agene candidate approach in which we investigated the genomic regionPosters: Cancer Genetics 107between markers D19S180 and D19S254 for which multipoint linkage analysis yielded the maximal LOD score (3.9) in this particular family. Genemapping and mutation search analysis revealed no pathologic mutations inseveral genes mapped in this region including STK13 and NES1 even if anumber of polymorphic variants have been identified. Further analysis ofcandidate genes in this region is in progress. ,2001
288,Familial paraganglioma (PGL1 OMIM 168000) is a rare tumor predisposi tion syndrome that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion butexclusively through the male germ line. This pattern of inheritance is con sistent with genomic imprinting. Affected individuals develop slow growingtumors of the head and neck region that affect most commonly the carotidbody. Recently the responsible gene the succinate ubiquinone oxidore ductase subunit D (SDHD) was identified (Science 287 848 2000). Itencodes the small subunit of cytochrome b in mitochondrial complex II. Heterogeneous mutations were detected in five PGL1 families. Based onthese findings we studied two patients with hereditary paragangliomasand concomitant pheochromocytoma. Sequencing of the coding regionrevealed two novel mutations. In the first case a 36 year old man wefound a mutation in the start codon (ATG>AAG met>lys) together with a 3bp deletion in intron 1. Analyses of four siblings and two children revealedthat the start codon mutation segregated with individuals affected by para gangliomas whereas the deletion did not. This suggests that the lattermost likely represents a polymorphism on the second allele. This deletionwas not found in 100 normal control chromosomes. The second case a29 year old woman had a 12 bp deletions in exon 3 codons 91 94. Herpotentially affected relatives are currently under investigation. The identifi cation of asymptomatic gene carriers in PGL1 families is particularly rele vant because regular screening programs can be offered that allow theearly recognition and treatment of tumors even before they become clini cally apparent. ,2001
289, bonn.deA predominance of de novo mutations in the paternal germline has beenreported for several disorders (for review see Crow Nature Reviews Genetics 1 Oct. 2000). Parental origin of APC mutations in familial ade nomatous polyposis (FAP) has not been systematically examined so far. FAP is a precancerous condition characterized by the occurrence of hun dreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas and extracolonic manifesta tions. FAP is caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor geneAPC. We examined 680 unrelated FAP families for germline mutations. In53 out of 411 families with known family history (13%) both parents of theindex patient had not developed colorectal adenomas suggesting a denovo mutation. A germline mutation was detected in 41 of these 53patients in 27 cases the mutation was excluded in both parents. Overall the 5 bp deletion at codon 1309 was found in 47/680 patients (7%). Thismutation was overrepresented in the group of patients with de novo muta tions (17/53 = 32%) thus demonstrating that the high frequency of thismutation is not due to a founder effect but rather due to de novo mutationevents. Parental origin of de novo mutations could be traced in 8 families. Five mutations were of paternal and 3 of maternal origin. Interestingly the1309 de novo mutation was observed in the maternal germline only. Muta tions in the paternal germline included one large deletion of about 10Mb two base exchanges (R564X S1201X) and twice the 5bp deletion at codon1061. In the maternal germline the 5bp deletion at codon 1309 was foundtwice in addition to the mutation c.3556delGA at codon 1186. In conclu sion in our sample de novo APC germline mutations show a slightly high er frequency in the paternal germline. Further families have to be studiedto see whether the observed difference in parental origin and mutation spectrum are reproducible.

290,Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a heritable form of colon cancercaused by autosomal dominant inheritance of the mutated adenomatouspolyposis coli (APC) gene. We investigated the APC mutation and pheno typic spectrum of 180 members of 39 Singapore FAP families. The proteintruncation test (PTT) and DNA sequencing were used to screen the entireAPC coding region for germline mutations. APC mutations were found in31 families (79 %). 72 patients tested positive while 64 non affected mem bers tested negative. The correlation of PTT to clinical diagnosis is there fore 100% suggesting that PTT is a highly specific presymptomatic test forFAP. Twenty two different APC mutations including two genomic deletions were identified. Thirteen mutations were novel. All mutations except one resulted in the classical colonic phenotype. Nine families have the same(AAAGA) deletion at codon 1309 indicating that like the Western families codon 1309 is also the mutation hot spot for Singapore families. Interest ingly mutation at codon 332 resulted in attenuated FAP with left sided pre dominance of polyps rather than the right. For the eight families withoutAPC mutations we screened for beta catenin mutation which was shownto substitute for APC mutation in sporadic colorectal cancer. No germlinebeta catenin mutation was found. Further analysis reveals atypical clinicalfeatures such as the co existence of adenomatous and hyperplastic polypsand other non FAP associated cancers in these patients. Our results sug gest the involvement of other genes and possibly new variants for thepolyposis syndrome. ,2001
291,BACKGROUND This study was done at Donald Fraser hospital in ruralremote South Africa. There were 18 pedigree families descended from achief with 5 wives and 17 children. To date this family has ~465 pedigreemembers excluding ~135 spouses. Of this pedigree 15 persons died fromcolon cancer and 9 members have colorectal adenomatous polyps. Fourpersons in their late teens have had proctocolectomy. No colorectal can cer screening program exists for these families. So far no genetic studies108 Posters: Cancer Geneticshave been done. OBJECTIVE To screen pedigree members suspected with FAP for colorectal polyps by colonoscopy. METHODS Selectionswere based on risk of having colon polyps from family history and on sat isfying inclusion and exclusion criteria for colonoscopy. RESULTS Seven ty seven persons were selected. Thirty three (37%) persons respondedand had colonoscopy. A mother had four and her daughter had eight colonadenomatous polyps. In the latter polyps showed severe dysplasia with nomalignancy. Both declined further interventions despite counselling forpotential benefits of proctocolectomy. CONCLUSIONS The study estab lished a need for regular continuous colon cancer screening for the pedi gree and provides information of use in setting up a hereditary colon can cer registry. These families need education and counselling about FAP toimprove compliance to screening programmes and surgical treatment. Chemotherapy for inducing polyp regression may be considered as analternative treatment for objectors to colorectal surgery. Genetic testingidentifies persons with the genetic trait and further research in this respectis recommended. ,2001
292,Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP {MIM175100}) is an autosomal dom inantly inherited disease caused by germ line mutations in the APC gene. It predisposes to the development of hundreds to thousands of colorectalpolyps of which some will progress to cancer. Additionally FAP patientsoften develop extracolonic manifestation such as desmoids osteomasand retinal lesions. There is a high new mutation rate with estimates of upto 25% of all cases being sporadic. Sporadic FAP patients from theSwedish population are analysed with respect to APC gene mutations toinvestigate whether mutational mosaicism could account for some of thenew cases. We have to date found one case of low level mutationalmosaicism. The patient had an attenuated form of FAP (few polyps) butmutational screening with direct sequencing or protein truncation tests onblood derived DNA indicated a normal APC gene. However using single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) low level mutationalmosaicism was demonstrated. Sequencing of the corresponding DNA band excised from a silverstained polyacrylamide gel confirmed the pres ence of a mutation in the APC gene. Mutation screening of various tissuefrom the affected patient and from the parents will be used to investigatethe origin of the mutation. Our findings demonstrate the importance ofusing mutation detection methods which can detect mutated APC allelespresent at only low levels especially for sporadic cases of FAP. ,2001
293, erlangen.deFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorderwhich typically progresses from extensive adenomatous polyp formation ofthe colon to colorectal cancer in early adult life. FAP is associated withmutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) located on chr5q21 which acts as a tumor suppressor gene. The most frequent mutationin APC is a 5 bp deletion starting in codon 1309 which predicts a transla tional frame shift leading to a truncated gene product. In general the appli cation of MALDI MS (MALDI TOF MS matrix assisted laser desorptionionization time of flight mass spectrometry) to DNA analysis provides apowerful tool for an efficient analysis of genetic polymorphisms and muta tions. In comparison to gel based or chromatographic techniques MALDI TOF MS offers high accuracy and fast analysis in parallel allowing for high throughput qualities. Here we present a primer extension assay optimizedfor the analysis of the 5 bp APC deletion. The specific extension primer iselongated to different length depending on the presence or absence of thedeletion. This results in defined molecular masses of the products gener ated which are reliably distinguished by MALDI TOF MS. In addition amultiplex assay to screen for other known mutations associated with APCis currently being developed. ,2001
294,The purpose of our study was to determine the usefulness of primer exten sion preamplification (PEP) method in analysis of APC gene mutations infamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. We analysed polyps andperipheral blood from two patients with FAP. They had the germline 5 bpdeletion at the codon 1309 of the APC gene. We assumed that at leastsome parts of polyps in two patients had the second hit at APC gene andother early genetic changes. The inability to detect them in DNA isolatedfrom the whole polyp could be explained by presence of normal tissuewithin polyps or heterogenous genetic changes within the epithelium of apolyp. We analysed microdissections of deparaffinized tissue for mutationsand loss of heterozygosity at the APC gene. In order to increase the quan tity of target DNA available from small samples each microdissection wasfirst preamplifed by using PEP. Aliquouts of PEP reactions were thenamplifed by using three pairs of APC primers which could amplify three dif ferent parts of exon 15 of the APC gene. All samples were also analysedfor K ras mutation. PCR products were analysed by restriction fragmentlength polymorphism (RFLP) method and by electrophoresis on SpreadexEL 300 gels. By using microdissection and PEP PCR we were able toprove germline second hit mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) ofthe APC gene. In order to confirm the accuracy of PEP method three dif ferent pairs of primers for exon 15 of the APC gene were used the sameresults were obtained. Our study showed that PEP method provided moreaccurate insight into different genetic changes of FAP. ,2001
295,Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inher ited disorder caused by germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposiscoli (APC) gene. It is characterised by early onset of polyposis coli anddevelopment of colorectal carcinoma as a consequence of mutations in anumber of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. The APC gene muta tions were investigated in 46 Czech unrelated FAP families and 9 sus pected FAP families to cover the entire of exons 1 15 to the codon 1773.Molecular studies involve DGGE and sequence analysis. The 25 germlineAPC mutations were found in total of 55 cases. Of the identified mutationseleven mutations have not yet been described and are presumed to benovel 1)seven frameshift mutations 1225delC in exon 9 2733 2734insA 3049 3052delAATG 3332 3335delAAAC 3751 3752insT 3818 3822del GATGT and 3872 3873insA all in exon 15 2) two nonsense mutations 1297C>T in exon 9 and 1411G>T in exon 11. Both frameshift and non sense mutations resulted in the classical form of FAP but the deletion C inexon 9 caused attenuated FAP. 3) two splicing mutations IVS11+1G>Aand IVS11+1G>T in intron 11. Family with this type of mutation showedvariable individual phenotypes including an occurrence of CHRPE. Thestudy continues using the combination of PTT and DGGE methods.

296,Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominantly inherit ed colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome that is caused in the major ity of cases by germline mutation within the adenomatous polyposis coli(APC) gene. However based on the mouse model studies and a strongphenotypic variability observed both within and among affected families FAP has been considered as a complex condition where environmental aswell as genetic factors play a role in the disease expression. So far suchadditional genetic factors remain unknown. A large FAP kinderd which har bours an adenine deletion at codon 1982 of the APC gene has been pre viously reported by our group. Though carrying the same mutation theaffected subjects (45) present with variable colonic and extracolonic man ifestations which are in several branches transmitted through the genera Posters: Cancer Genetics 109tions. To evaluate its correlation with the occurrence of extracolonic dis ease we initially performed linkage analysis of the 1p35 36 region whichrevealed lod score of 2.08 for marker D1S211. Furthermore a detailedmutation analysis of the candidate sPLA2 NAT2 and COX2 genes exclud ed them as potential modifiers of FAP phenotype. Recent evaluation of thepotential of this pedigree to detect a modifier gene using simulation stud ies revealed very promising results that led us to continue the linkage map ping on the genome wide level. The results of simulation studies a conse quent linkage analysis of further candidate regions and eventually resultson the genome wide screening for a modifier gene in FAP condition will bepresented. ,2001
297,Analysis was performed on DNA isolated from 85 FAP patients 165 FAPfamily members and 50 healthy controls. From all FAP patients 8 5% hadfeatures of Gardner syndrome. In 4 other cases the attenuated adenoma tous polyposis of colon (AAPC) symptoms were observed. In analysis ofAPC gene in Polish population exons 10 11 12 13 14 and the 5 regionof exon 15 were scanned for mutations using PCR HD PCR SSCP andPTT. All differential SSCP patterns and heteroduplex bands were analyzedby direct sequencing of PCR product. Premature termination of translation(PTT) was found in 2 families (total 17 families were studied for segment 3of exon 15). Mutations of APC gene in Polish population are heterozygous but most of them (70%) were observed between codons 1040 1309. Thefrequency the common 5 bp deletions at codon 1309 are the same as thatreported by the other groups (9.5%). Results from scanning for mutationwere subsequently used for carrier detection in FAP families. In 9 familiescomprising 36 persons at mutation risk but without clinical symptoms wefound 11 persons with APC gene mutation. Thus our study excluded 25person from standard clinical treatment used for group at risk. Direct analy sis of mutation heredity was the most effective but indirect methods of car rier detection are also useful but genetic markers selected for this analy sis should be characterized by high PIC (polymorphic information content)and heterozygosity. For indirect detection of carrier status we used threehighly polymorphic (CA)n markers closely linked to APC gene. One hun dred chromosomes from unrelated individuals and 128 chromosomes fromunrelated FAP patients were subjected to analysis of allele frequencies atloci D5S299 D5S346 and D5S82. In our studies significantly higher fre quency of allele A4 of D5S299 was observed among FAP patients. We alsoobserved new alleles in locus D5S299 allele A 6.1 (158 bp) in locusD5S346 allele A14 (94 bp) and in locus D5S82 allele nan,2001
298,There is evidence for genetic predisposition to prostate cancer about 5 10% of patients have a family history of the disease. The CRC/BPG UKFamilial Prostate Cancer Study has a multifaceted approach to try to iden tify the genes involved. There is evidence for both highly penetrant andlower penetrance genes and so several different DNA collections havebeen targeted. These are a collection of blood DNA from 285 single youngcases with prostate cancer diagnosed at <55 years a systematic series ofover 1000 prostate cancer patients treated at one centre and for high riskgenes and an international collaboration (the ACTANE consortium) has194 families with three or more cases of prostate cancer to perform linkagestudies. Several linkage studies by other groups have suggested multiplelocations for high risk prostate cancer genes the first in 1996 at chromo some 1q24 (called HPC1) followed by other loci at 1q42 1p36 (associat ed particularly with primary brain tumour) and Xq. A recent locus has alsobeen suggested at 20q and other weaker suggestions of locations havebeen described. To date none of these have been cloned. In October agene located at 17p was cloned (HPC2) which has sequence variants that may be associated with a 2.7 fold prostate cancer risk. Within ACTANE wehave shown that HPC1 is more likely to contribute to larger families with >4cases and a meta analysis of 772 families from a worldwide internationalconsortium has shown that only about 6% of prostate cancer families arelikely to be due to nan,2001
299,The p53 is a tumour suppressor gene which codes for a nuclear phospho protein of 53KDa related to the regulation of cellular proliferation throughmechanisms of blockage of the celular cycle and apoptosis mainly afterdamage caused to DNA. Most mutations in the p53 gene result in a non functional protein which present an increase half life accumulating in thenucleus of tumoral cells. Generally this mutations are involved in thedevelopment or progression of a series of neoplasias including oesopha gus and cardic adenocarcinomas. Some reports demonstrate iots pres ence also in intestinal metaplasia and displasic lesions. Various polimor phisms were also described at the p53 gene and one of the most frequentis the R72P present in the exon 4 which can be related to an increasedsuscetibility to various cancers. Loss of heterozygosity its also a commonand early event in the majority of cancers and is used to describe loss ofchromossomic material which as a consequence leaves the cell with onlyan allele of a mutant gene. The aims of the present work were a)to analyse the frequency of the R72Ppolimorphism in controls individuals representing the population of PortoAlegre and in individuals with Barrett s Esophagous (a pre malignantepithelial alteration leading to adenocarcinoma in 10% of those subjects) b) to verify the presence of an association between the frequenciesobserved for controls and Barrett s and c) to verify loss of heterozygositywhen analysing DNA extracted from blood and affected tissue from indi viduals with Barrett s. The method used was PCR of exon 4 of the p53 gene followed by restric tion analysis with the enzyme AccII from 80 controls and 23 Barrett s. Our results showed that the proportion of homozygous for A72 homozy gous for P72 and heterozygous for the two alleles was 38.75% 15% and46 25% respectively for the control group and 39.1% 8.7% and 52.2% inBarrett s individuals. No statistically significant differences were foundregarding the genotype distribution amongst the two groups. We have found one LOH amongst the informative individuals (8.33%) andsurprisingly 4 cases of genomic instability (22 2%) suggesting an associ ation of these events and development of adenocarcinoma. ,2001
300,110 Posters: Cancer GeneticsGluathione S transferases (GSTs) are phase II enzymes which introduce a glutathione for conjugation of electrophilic metabolites. The polymor phisms of GSTs are demonstrated to be associated with bladder cancer insome populations. No data was available for the Turkish population. GSTM1 null GSTP1 105 Ile/Val and GSTT1 null genotype polymorphismswere determined in 100 age sex matched controls 98 random controls and 121 bladder cancer patients in the Turkish population. The relative riskof GSTM1 null genotype was 1.91 (95% CI 1.11 3.28). This risk is malespecific (OR 2.21 95 % CI 1.18 4.22). The combination of GSTM1 nullgenotype and GSTP1 105 Val allele results in a 3.66 fold risk (95% CI 1.68 7.84). GSTP1 105 Val allele could not be shown to be associated with theinvasiveness of tumor either alone (OR 2.06 95% 0.91 4.63) or in combi nation with GSTM1 null genotype (OR 3.42 95%CI 0.96 12.12). In thisstudy a slight male specific risk of bladder cancer due to GSTM1 null geno type and a substantial risk for combination of risky GSTM1 null andGSTP1 105 Val genotypes was observed in the Turkish population. ,2001
301,Retinoblastoma is a retinal neoplasm occuring in early childhood in bothheritable and sporadic forms. Current knowledge indicates that mutationsof both alleles of the RB 1 gene localized on chromosome 13 are prereq uisite for the development of this tumor. Previous investigations onretinoblastoma patient samples with abnormalities on chromosome 6phave suggested that some genes on 6p could be important for tumor pro gression. We suggested in a recent study on Y 79 retinoblastoma cell linethat the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) could be a probable can didate gene on chromosome 6p involved in the tumoral development orprogression pathway. In this present study focused on the molecular analy sis of the TNF alpha gene in 70 retinoblastoma patient samples wedescribed a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5 UTR regulatory regionof the TNF alpha gene. This single nucleotide change found in retinoblas toma patients could be associated with the disease susceptibility or sever ity. Further in this study the possible consequences of this mutation in theretinal tumor development or progression and the action of TNF alpha oncell cycle regulated proteins will be discussed. ,2001
302,N acetyltransferase (NAT) is one of the major liver enzymes that isinvolved in biotransformation of drugs and other exogenous substances. More than 20 different NAT1 and NAT2 allelic variants have been detectedso far most of which result from single nucleotide substitutions and/orsmall deletion/insertions. Mutant alleles of NAT genes are associated witheither a slow or a rapid acetylator phenotype. Recent studies have sug gested that the frequency of certain NAT2 allels is statistically different inlung cancer (LC) patients compared to that of normal control population which suggests that they are important genetic modifiers of individual sus ceptibility for LC development. The aim of this study was to determineallele frequency distribution of the most common NAT2 polymorphisms inLC patients and normal control population from Macedonia. The study wasperformed on DNA samples isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of50 LC patients and a matching number of newborns. The methodology forthe detection of NAT2 polymorphisms included the combination ofPCR/RLFP and allele specific PCR amplification. The frequencies of NAT2homozygous rapid heterozygous and homozygous slow genotypes were5% 42.5% and 52.5% in LC patients and 8% 32% and 60% in controlindividuals respectively (p>0.05). These data suggest that NAT2 acetyla tion polymorphisms are not LC sussceptibility factors among Macedonianpopulation. ,2001
303,The role of CYP1A1 and GSTM1 genotype in benign prostatic hyperplasiaand prostate cancer risk was investigated in Turkish populations through acase control study. Using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method the CYP1A1*3 polymorphism in exon 7 of the gene wasanalyzed in 46 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients 63 prostatecancer (PCa) patients and 155 control subjects. The CYP1A1 Ile/Val geno type was significantly increased the risk for patients with BPH (OR 2.8 95% CI 1.38 5.91). However there were no statistical differences in thedistribution of CYP1A1 Val/Val genotype among BPH individuals (OR 1.5 95% CI 0.29 8.05). In the PCa populations patients with CYP1A1 Val/Valrevealed a 10.4 fold higher risk of having prostate cancer than those with[Ile/Ile] (OR 10.47 95% CI 3.49 31.39). In other words the presence ofVal/Val genotype significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer. Fur thermore the frequency of Ile/Val genotype was found to be statistically dif ferent with an OR of 6.10 (95% CI 3.07 12.13) suggesting that patientscarrying this genotype were at increased risk for developing prostate can cer. We also analyzed the influence of GSTM1 polymorphism in patientsand 202 control individuals. The GSTM1 null genotype was observed in34.7% of the control subjects. No significant differences were observed inthe frequency of the nulled individuals in BPH and PCa patients when com pared with control populations. To determine if any combined associationof BPH and PCa development we analyzed the combined effect of theGSTM1 and CYP1A1 genoype. Among the BPH patients the combinationof GSTM1 null genotype and CYP1A1 Ile/Ile was found to be statisticallydifferent (OR 2.461 95%CI 1.028 5.850). Furthermore CYP1A1 Ile/Valgenotype when combined with GSTM1 +/+ and 0/0 genotypes were alsostatistically significant (OR 3.346 95%CI 1.293 8.658 and OR 5.086 95%CI 1.715 15.083 respectively). However BPH patients having Val/Valgenotype with GSTM1 +/+ or 0/0 was not different than those with Ile/Ileand GSTM +/+. Among the PCa populations patients with Val allelerevealed higher risk of having prostate cancer when combined GSTM1genotypes. ,2001
304,The acetylation polymorphism plays an important part in the detoxificationof numerous exogenous substances. The metabolism of aromatic aminesvia phase I enzymes (cytochrome P450 CYP1A2) and phase II enzymese.g. N acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) have been shown to be individually dif ferent. Therefore they can lead to a different predisposition of genotoxicand carcinogenic effects. In our study we analysed mutations of CYP1A2and NAT2 genes in 194 patients suffering from primary bladder cancer and209 control individuals. Slow acetylators of NAT2 have been said to bemore affected by bladder cancer in contrast to rapid acetylators whichdetoxify toxic metabolites in a faster way. We identified slow acetylators tobe significantly more prone to primary bladder cancer (odds ratio 1.88 confidence interval 1.25 2.82) especially male persons with the frequentgenotype NAT2*5/*6 (OR 2.68 CI 1.51 4.75). The CYP1A2 gene is char acterized by mutation within the promotor region. This mutation is associ ated with an increased transcription rate leading to an elevated level ofhighly reactive metabolites. We have identified this mutation significantlymore frequent in patients with bladder cancer (OR 1.54 CI 1.04 2.28). Inaddition for the combination of these NAT2 and CYP1A2 mutations wecalculated a significantly potentiated risk for the development of bladdercancer (OR 4.88 CI 2.08 11.42). These results indicate that polymorphicgenes of phase I and phase II enzymes contribute to an individual sus ceptibility for the development of cancer f.i. bladder cancer.

305,Transforming growth factor b (TGF b) is a tumor suppressor molecule thatPosters: Cancer Genetics 111acts by inhibition of cellular proliferation or by promotion of cellular differ entiation and apoptosis. Its effects are exerted through binding to threehigh affinity cell surface receptors. Type I TGFb receptor shows a commonpolymorphism which is a deletion of 3 out of 9 alanine stretch. In recentstudies homozygotes and higher frequency of heterozygotes for thispolymorphic allele TbRI(6A) were only found in cancer cases. It was sug gested that TbRI(6A) receptor has an impaired antiproliferative capacityand acts as a tumor susceptibility allele. Here we present our data on thefrequency of the TbRI(6A) allele in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and amatching number of normal controls (NC) from Macedonia. DNA was iso lated from 100 paraffin embedded tissue samples of CRC patients andfrom peripheral blood leukocytes of 100 newborns. The presence of theTbRI(6A) allele was evaluated by PAG electrophoresis of BssSI digested118 bp PCR fragment from exon 1 of the TbRI gene. Only one homozygotefor TbRI(6A) allele was present in CRC patients while in NC homozygosi ty for this allele was not detected. (p>0.05). Six and nine heterozygoteswere detected in CRC patients and in NC respectively (p>0.05). The allelefrequency of TbRI(6A) was 0.08 and 0.09 in CRC patients and in NC respectively (p>0.05). These data excludes the TbRI(6A) allele as a tumorsusceptibility allele for the development of CRC in our population. ,2001
306,We addressed the role of known and presumed genetic factors in coloncancer predisposition most particularly in the context of familial cancersthat are not recognized clinically as classical HNPCC which may repre sent up to 20% of the cases in the population. One study group (n=87) wasselected from a hospital based series of newly diagnosed colorectalpatients. It included patients diagnosed under the age of 50 (n=20) 31sporadic cases and 56 patients with a family cancer history. Among these twelve were HNPCC or suspected HNPCC patients 18 had one first degree relative affected with colon cancer and 26 had more distant rela tives affected with colon or other cancer types. Most tumors in this familialgroup were stable at microsatellite markers (41/56 73% MSS) while 13%were highly unstable (MSI). Another group of 82 individuals representing63 families were referred to the genetic clinics in Ottawa and were identi fied through the Ontario Familial Colon Cancer Registry. PCR SSCP andmore recently total DNA sequencing were applied to analyze the entirecoding regions of the MSH2 MLH1 and MSH6 genes. Pathogenic MSH2and MLH1 germline mutations were identified in a minority of newly diag nosed cases (1.1%) unselected for MSI family history or age of onset. Asimilar incidence was reported in population based studies from Finlandand Slovania. MSH2 and MLH1 mutations accounted for 10 % of all coloncancer families examined (n~100) unstratified by complexity or MSI sta tus. However MSH2/MLH1 mutations were more prevalent among familiesmeeting Amsterdam criteria I (6/21 29%) than among those meeting nei ther criteria I nor II (4/54 7%). The A(IVS5 +3)T splicing MSH2 mutationwas recurrent being present in 5% of all familial cases 19% of criteria I positive and 2% of criteria I II negative families. Thirty familial cases (4 MSIhigh 6 low 20 MSS) were selected for MSH6 analysis a study which isstill in progress. Exon 4 mutations were detected in 2 cases (7%). Aftersequencing the entire TGFBR2 gene (TGF beta type II receptor) a singlepathogenic mutation was identified among 25 MSS familial cases andnone in 8 MSI cases. No germline mutation nor deletions in exon 3 of thebeta catenin gene (CTNNB1) were detected among 40 MSS familialcases. A relatively important proportion of HNPCC (70%) and of suspect ed HNPCC families (>90%) and all cases of common familial colon can cer remain unaccounted for at the genetic level. The limited success of thecandidate gene approach suggests that linkage or affected sib pair analy ses have a greater potential to elucidate the mechanisms predisposing toMSS hereditary and familial cancers. ,2001
307,Inherited mutations in the BRCA genes are common in patients with famil ial breast and ovarian cancer. Ashkenazi Jewish population is character ized by three common mutations namely 185delAG and 5382insC inBRCA1 gene and 6174delT in BRCA2 gene. 5382insC BRCA1 mutationcontributes significantly to ovarian cancer in Moscow. All the mutationsincrease 8 10 fold risk of breast tumour development. We have performedscreening for the common BRCA mutations in the cohort of 26 Jewish and38 Slavic patients with familial or sporadic breast cancer and 38 Ashkenazicontrols. PCR followed by heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencingallowed us to find carriers of these mutations. We have found one carrierof 6174delT mutation among patients unselected in respect of breast can cer. It was the first report of BRCA2 gene mutation from Russia. No casesof 185delAG and 6174delT mutation in BRCA1 gene were found in ourpatient sample. However 3 unrelated cases of 5382insC mutations werefound in Slavic breast cancer patients and none in control group. Newmutation g71741ins12nt in BRCA1 gene was described. This mutation isdue to duplication of 12 nucleotides and results in formation of two directrepeats in intron 20 of BRCA1 gene. Our results suggest the importance ofscreening the St. Petersburg Slavic patients for 5382insC BRCA1 genemutation and the low impact of 185delAG BRCA1 mutation and 6174delTBRCA2 mutation on breast cancer development in St. Petersburg.

308,To determine the pattern and incidence of BRCA1/2 mutation in the Ger man population the Deutsche Kerbshilfe is funding 10 groups includingthe munich study group. 72 families were divided in riskgroups accordingto the number of affected patients and age of diseaseonset. Mutaionscreening of the BRCA1/2 gene by SSCP analysis PTT (Western blot) Southern blot and sequencing reveald 4 BRCA1 mutations and 4 BRCA2 mutation in 37 families with at least 2 3 familial cases of isolated breastcancer. At least 1 2 below 50 y.o.a 2 BRCA1 mutations in 15 families. Withbreast and ovarian cancer. One mutation in 27 pationts from families withles than three affected members or multitumor families. The 5382insC andthe 4650delCA mutations were found twice. Suggesting perscreening forthese mutations in the German population. Screening of 20 these families112 Posters: Cancer Geneticsfor BRCA2 mutation revealed 4 mutations. These results are in ocordance with recent findings (i) a high incidence of BRCA1 mutations in largebreast cancer families or families with breast and ovarial cancer (ii) lowincidence in families with less than three affected females (iii) preponder ance of putative founder mutations. ,2001
309,ABSTRACT Background Estimated 5 10% of all breast and ovarian can cers can be of hereditary origin. Germline mutations in highly penetrantsusceptibility BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes could cause predisposition tothese cancers. Material and Methods Molecular genetic testing of BRCA1and BRCA2 genes have been performed in 69 high risk breast andbreast/ovarian cancer families and in 16 early onset sporadic breast orovarian cancer in women diagnosed below 40 years at Masaryk MemorialCancer Institute in Brno Czech Republic. The mutation analysis was car ried out on genomic DNA isolated from blood samples of affected individ uals. Protein truncation test and heteroduplex analysis followed by directsequencing were used. The genetic counseling and preventive clinical fol low up of gene carriers is part of the genetic program. Results A germline disease causing mutation was found in 34 screened high risk families(49%) 21 mutations (7 different) in BRCA1 gene and 13 mutations (9 dif ferent) in BRCA2 gene. One frame shift mutation detected in BRCA1 andtwo frame shift mutations detected in BRCA2 gene were novel mutations. In the group of 16 woman diagnosed with sporadic early onset breast/ovar ian cancer no disease causing mutation was found. Conclusion A muta tion was identified in either gene in 49% of high risk families proving thatgermline mutations in these breast cancer susceptibility genes might beresponsible for an important fraction of inherited breast and ovarian cancercases in the Czech Republic. Spectrum of mutations found in both genesis variable. ,2001
310,The cloning of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes has led to the identification ofseveral hundreds germline mutations in families with a history of hereditarybreast cancer. Some of the mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are recur rently identified in distinct geographic and ethnic populations and are believed to have spread from a single ancestor. It is important to charac terize these founder mutations and determine their geographic distributionin order to be able to design efficient mutation screening. The most recur rent mutation in Sweden is the 3171ins5 mutation in nan,2001
311, kiel.deVery few individuals with a germline mutation in both breast/ovarian can cer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been described so far. The majority of them are of Ashkenazi Jewish descendent. We report thefirst German case with heterozygous germline mutation in both BRCA1and BRCA2 genes. The female patient was diagnosed with breast cancerat age 32. Her paternal family branch contained four relatives with breastcancer as well as cases of testicular prostate and pancreatic cancer. Themother of the propositus deceased from ovarian cancer and the maternalgrandmother from early onset breast cancer. Mutation screening of theindex patient revealed heterozygosity of the mutations 185delAG and5950delCT in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes respectively. A paternal sis ter with breast cancer and the unaffected father were found to carry theBRCA2 mutation 5950delCT but not the BRCA1 mutation 185delAG. As tothe family history segregation of this BRCA1 mutation from the maternalfamily branch seems likely. Nevertheless a novel mutation cannot be ruledout as no members of the maternal branch have been tested so far. Nei ther family history nor haplotype analyses of BRCA1 and BRCA2 linkedmarkers provided evidence for an Ashkenazi Jewish origin of the muta tions. To the best of our knowledge we present the first non AshkenazyEuropean case heterozygous for both breast cancer susceptibility genes. As to the implications of double heterozygosity on genetic counselling werecommend complete screening of both genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 in fam ilies suspicious for heredity of breast and/or ovarian cancer in both pater nal and maternal branch. This work was supported by the Deutsche Kreb shilfe. ,2001
312,Background & purpose Mutation analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2genes is expensive and frequently fails to identify any pathogenic abnor mality. We have reviewed the outcome of genetic testing of patients testedthrough the SA Familial Cancer Service and divided them into categorieswith a view of increasing the efficiency of mutation testing. Methods DNAsamples were collected from patients who fulfilled the Australian NationalBreast Cancer Centre (NBCC) high genetic risk criteria (ie three closerelatives with breast or ovarian cancer or two with high risk features) orhad breast cancer under the age of 30 or ovarian cancer under the age of40 or were males with breast cancer. Patients were divided into cate gorises according to the clinical setting. Both genes were fully screened byCCM/direct sequencing or PTT/DGGE/direct sequencing unless a patho genic mutation was found. Results Overall 30% of 244 affected individu als had a mutation in either gene this represented 26% of the familiestested. The frequency of mutations in each clinical category varied from0% to 80%. In most categories BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were equal ly likely. However early onset ovarian cancer was associated with BRCA1mutations and late onset breast cancer and male breast cancer wereassociated with BRCA2 mutations. Conclusions Clinical categories canprovide some clues regarding the chance of identifying a mutation inBRCA1 or BRCA2 but the overall detection rate remains low. Other selec tion criteria (perhaps histological indices or immuno histochemistry) arerequired to improve the efficiency of genetic testing in familial breast can cer. ,2001
313,The mutational spectrum of breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 andBRCA2 exhibits considerable ethnic and geographical diversity. Bothgenes have a broad spectrum of putative pathologic mutations and bothhave variant alleles found at high frequency in the population but not asso ciated with an apparent increase in cancer risk. We have screened formutations extensively the coding sequence and intron exon boundaries ofBRCA1 gene and in a less extend of BRCA2 gene in 100 Greek unrelatedpatients with a family history of at least one relative with breast cancerunder the age 50 yrs and ovarian cancer at any age. With respect to theknown founder mutations in the European population 185delAG C61Gand 5382insC only the third one was found in five patients (5%) and theiraffected relatives. Several other unique deleterious mutations were identi fied in exon 11 of nan,2001
314,Inherited mutation of BRCA1/2 gene results in breast or ovarian cancer. However genome peculiarities that have an influence on occurrence ofbreast or ovarian cancer in family are not clear for the present. In present study occurrence of breast or ovarian cancer among predis posed families was analyzed in connection with single nucleotide polymor phism (SNP) of BRCA1 gene. The entire coding region of BRCA1 gene in a sample of 44 patients and 13members of proband families was screened by conformation sensitive gelelectrophoresis (CSGE). All structural variants of amplified DNA fragmentsfound by CSGE were sequenced on both strands. BRCA1 mutations and a frequently occurred set of 8 SNPs were found. Mutations were predominantly identified in breast/ovarian families. Analy sis of more than one affected individual in available families was per formed. It was shown that the set of SNPs is inherited as a whole. Both themutation and SNP set were on the same chromosome when these genealterations were investigated in individual. Patients were classified in accordance with the BRCA1 alterations as hav 114 Posters: Cancer Geneticsing a mutation mutation and the SNP set SNP set only none alterations. It was found that the frequencies of breast and ovarian cancer are not uni formly distributed in this series. This phenomenon was revealed whenaffected individuals in families were analyzed (P<0.001). Under BRCA1mutation the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer in familieswas higher whenthe gene had SNP set also (P < 0 01).The presence of the SNP set among patients with and without mutationswas different (29% and 72% respectively P < 0 01). An inheritance ofbreast cancer was found in 68% of families if proband had the SNP setwhereas only 25% of probands had these variations if ovarian canceroccurred in families (P < 0 01). In summary the occurrence of ovarian or breast cancer under inheritedpredisposition is in dependence on the SNPs found. These findings mayhave predictive and diagnostics significance. ,2001
315,Distribution of BRCA1 gene mutations appears to be population specific. Extending information about sequence variations in different geographicalregions is essential for more understanding of mutation spreading and formedical diagnostics. In present study the entire coding region of BRCA1 gene in a sample of 44patients 13 members of proband families and 28 individuals of controlgroup (predominantly Moscow region) was screened by conformation sen sitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE). All structural variants of amplified DNAfragments found by CSGE were sequenced on both strands. There were 17 mutations among patients (38.6%). These include five dif ferent mutations with predominance of 5382insC (76 4% of all mutations).Such high frequency (the most of known one) may suggest on geograph ic region of the mutation origin. Germ line variations of the BRCA1 genewere found as a frequently occurred set of predominantly 8 polymorphismsthat is inherited as a whole. Three of these IVS1 103T/C IVS1 115T/Cand IVS14 63C/G are described for the first time. This set of polymor phisms was observed in approximately 50% of both patients and controlindividuals investigated. Frequency of the genes having single variationswas 7% only. Analysis of more than one affected individual in availablefamilies was performed and alterations found were confirmed in all cases. Haplotypes described by single nucleotide polymorphism of the BRCA1gene were determined for all patients. Detailed characterization of the BRCA1 gene permits investigation of phe notype/genotype correlation and is necessary for medical diagnostics. ,2001
316,Significant part of inherited breast/ovarian cancer is connected withBRCA2 gene mutation. Information about sequence variations of the geneis necessary for more understanding of mutation spreading genome poly morphism and medical diagnostics. In present study BRCA2 gene sequence variations among breast/ovariancancer families in Russia (Moscow region) were analyzed. The codingregion of BRCA2 gene in a sample of 25 patients was screened by con formation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE). All structural variants ofamplified DNA fragments found by CSGE were sequenced on bothstrands. There were 8 mutations (32% of 25) 2 of which and two single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) are revealed for the first time. Two mutations wererecurrent (in two families each). High frequency of some variances wasshown H372N (25%) and IVS11+80del4 (40%). The latter is seldom inother populations. Analysis of more than one affected individual in avail able families was performed and alterations were confirmed in all cases. SNP haplotypes were determined for all the patients. So frequent andextensive set of SNPs that was typical for BRCA1 gene in Russia was notfound for nan,2001
317,BRCA1 and 2 are susceptibility genes associated with familiar breast can cer. In these genes the first mutation is germinal while the most frequentsomatic inactivation is a loss of heterozygosity (LOH). We selected 30patients belonging to high risk families with variants in BRCA1 and 2genes ten cases presented with a truncated mutation eleven a polymor phism and 9 cases a variant with unknown significance. We analyzed LOHcomparing normal and tumoral tissue from paraphynes. a) In all cases witha truncated mutation LOH was found. b) We have not found LOH in the 11cases with polymorphisms. c) Six of the 9 cases presented differentunknown variants. In one case there was LOH an analysis of segregationin different affected members of the family was compatible with a mutation. Four cases presented with the same variation in the BRCA1 gene andabsence of LOH. In one of these cases we could demonstrate the exis tence of a true mutation in the other gene nan,2001
318,Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for a smaller propor tion of hereditary breast cancer cases than previously suspected. Lessthan 20% of Finnish families with 3 or more breast cancers showed BRCA1or BRCA2 mutations (Vehmanen et al. AJHG 60 1050 1997 Huusko et al. AJHG 62 1544 1998). We recently reported a possible third breast cancersusceptibility locus at 13q21 q22 by linkage analysis in 77 Finnish Swedish and Icelandic breast cancer families (Kainu et al. PNAS 97 9603).This new locus explains only a proportion (estimated at <30%) of theremaining families suggesting presence of additional susceptibility loci. Here we undertook an exploratory genome wide search focusing on asample of 14 linkage informative multiplex breast cancer families (93 DNAspecimens) from the genetically homogeneous Finnish population. Thesefamilies tested negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 and showed no linkage tothe distal 13q21 q22 region. Simulations generated by the FASTSLINKprogram assuming genetic homogeneity predicted an expected maximumLOD score of 1.25 (52% of replications with LOD>1 21%>2 and 3%>3).Genome wide linkage analysis was performed with 398 dinucleotiderepeat markers on ABI 377 DNA sequencers. Based on a modified CASHmodel which assumes dominant transmission and age dependent pene trances a peak two point LOD score of 2.04 (q=0.0) was seen at 2q. Inaddition one other chromosomal region showed a two point LOD score>1.0. Analysis of more markers from the chromosomal regions of interest more individuals from the same families as well as additional families is inprogress to follow up these leads ,2001
319,Mutations in cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 account forapproximately 3 10% of breast cancer in the general population and amuch higher proportion in those with strong family history of breast andovarian cancer. Germline mutations in these genes have been identified inindividuals of all races and ethnic backgrounds. As part of an ongoingbreast cancer screening program in Manitoba a novel mutation has beencharacterised in two unrelated women of Ojibway background. Both werediagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 42 and have a strong fam ily history of early onset breast and ovarian cancer. The protein truncationtest (PTT) is routinely used to screen for BRCA1 mutations in genomicDNA and RNA extracted from peripheral blood. By PTT the exon 11 wildtype protein fragment (amino acids 224 841) and truncated fragment weredetected at ~76.5kDa and ~35kDa respectively in both women. DNAsequence analysis revealed two alterations occurring on the same BRCA1allele a transition 1506A>G resulting in Lys463Glu and an insertion 1509 1510insG leading to a stop codon following residue 478. Althoughthe women studied share the same ethnic background they live in sepa rate Ojibway communities and their family history spanning two genera tions does not identify a common relative to suggest the families are close ly related. We believe that we have identified a new ethnic specific muta tion that may allow for better breast cancer screening in women of Aborig inal descent. Further studies will help to determine whether this particularmutation is unique to the Manitoba Ojibway population. ,2001
320,Our study was designed to estimate the frequency and penetrance ofmutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as the role of the demographichistory of the population in the origin and diffusion of these mutated allelesin high risk French Canadian breast/ovarian cancer families. 527 individu als from 96 families which included Ã¢\x80Â¡ 3 cases of breast/ovarian cancer were first tested for all BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations reportedamong French Canadians. Our analysis led to the detection of the R1443X(BRCA1) allele in 10 families the 8765delAG (BRCA2) allele in 16 familiesand the 2816insA (BRCA2) allele in one family. Thereafter the completesequence of all exons and splicing sites of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was donein 69 affected individuals or obligate carriers from 61 families leading tothe detection of 6 novel frameshift mutations and 15 sequence variants. Additional analyses were carried out to test for regulatory mutations and forthe presence of large duplication or deletion in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 in63 individuals. The proportion of BRCA1/2 positive families among thoseshowing <4 (n=8) 4 or 5 (n=50) and Ã¢\x80Â¡6 (n=31) breast cancer cases of firstor second degree was 0% 32% and 48% whereas a mutation was foundin 65% of families with at least one ovarian cancer case (n=20). The casefor pursuing the search for new susceptibility loci is compelling given thefact that approximately two thirds of high risk French Canadian familiesundergoing BRCA1/2 testing receive an inconclusive results. In this per spective this founder cohort will allow us to create subgroups of non BRCA1/2 families based on their genealogical characteristics and thuscontributing to sampling design in linkage disequilibrium mapping studies. ,2001
321, leipzig.deCarcinoma of the breast are one of the most common cancer in womenbefore menopause. Nearly 5% of breast cancer cases are hereditary. In1994 two cancer related genes were identified following linkage analysis infamilies with breast and ovarian cancer on chromosomes 13 and 17 respectively. In the following years a wide spectrum of mutations andsequence alterations in both genes were listed in the Breast InformationCore (BIC). Most studies show a strong correlation between typicalsequence variants and ethnical origin. Thus it appears important to delin eate mutation spectrums for specific regional areas. As one of the 12 Ger man Breast Cancer Consortium centers we have undertaken geneticcounselling in over 200 patients with breast and ovarian cancer during thelast 3 years. We perform mutation screening for the index patients inBRCA1 and BRCA2 Gene by complete direct sequencing of 90% of thecoding region including the exon intron boundaries. 40/55 index patientsagreed for molecular testing. In 18 patients we found 19 different muta tions 9 mutations in the BRCA1 gene 10 mutations in the BRCA2 gene. One patient showed a cancer related sequence alteration both in BRCA1as well as in nan,2001
322,Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women. Chileanstudies reveal that this cancer present the second mortality rate. A familyhistory of breast cancer is one of the main risk factor for the developmentof the disease. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major hereditary breastcancer susceptibility genes. Mutations in these genes are major causes ofinherited breast cancer 664 predisposing mutations have been described but in specific populations only some of them were found to be associatedwith susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to establish the frequen cy of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in 382 chilean healthywomen with two relatives affected with breast cancer. We have determinedthe frequency of 185delAG and 5382insC mutations in BRCA1 and6174delT mutation in BRCA2 using mismatch PCR assay. Only the PCRproduct of the normal allele acquired a restriction site this was confirmedby specific restriction endonucleases digestion. The frequency of the185delAG was 0.0026 (1/382). The other two mutations were not detectedin studied women group. This genetic study is part of a breast cancerscreening program that includes also annual mammography and clinicalbreast examination during five years. Strategies to reduce morbility andmortality associated with breast cancer lie in the early detection of womenwith genetic risk. Supported by CONAC Chile (National Corporation ofCancer) ,2001
323, bonn.deIntroduction In the german population 15 frequent BRCA1 mutations and8 frequent BRCA2 mutations represent 67% and 41% of all mutationsfound in families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (German breastcancer consortium). The aim of this study is the identification of foundermutations and hot spot mutations specific for the german population. Asso ciation analysis was performed for 19 different BRCA mutations (BRCA1 14 BRCA2 5) which were detected at least 3 times. Methods/Material Patients were genotyped for three intragenic markers D17S855 D17S1322 and D17S1323 in the BRCA1 gene and for closely flankingmarkers D13S1698 D13S171 and D13S267 in the BRCA2 gene. Allelefrequencies were established in a german control group. The observed fre quencies were compared to the frequencies expected from the controlallele frequences assuming Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Statistical analy sis was performed with an exact test of goodness of fit (M ller et al. 1991).Results BRCA1 For the 3 most frequent mutations (5382insC T300G and3819del5) we could demonstrate a statistical significant association with aspecific allele for all three markers. Other frequent mutations showed a sta tistical significance for at least one marker. Patients with the 3. most fre quent mutation 4184del4bp had no association with any markers. BRCA2 Statistical significant association with one or all analysed markers could bedemonstrated for patients with mutations 2034insA and 9317insA. In caseof mutation C5910G a common haplotype was defined which was not sig nificant because of high allele frequencies of the shared alleles. In patientswith mutation 3034del4 or 4702del4 we could not identify a common hap lotype. Conclusions The genotype data for the three markers analysedeach in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene are in concordance with the pres ence of specific haplotypes. Therefore most of the frequent mutationsdetected are likely to be founder mutations. Suprisingly four C to T transi tions in the BRCA1 gene which had been expected to result from inde pendent mutational events are probably also founder mutations. In con trast the 4bp deletion in the BRCA1 gene (4184del4bp) and the most fre quent mutation 3034delA in BRCA2 are recurrent mutations for which nosignificant associations with specific founder alleles could be shown. To define the specific haplotype further informative family members are col lected to confirm the data. ,2001
324, ulm.deCaveolin 1 (Cav 1) is an integral membran protein and the principal com ponent of small vesicular invaginations of the plasma membran the so called caveolae. A number of studies suggest that caveolin is involved incell signaling and could function as a tumor suppressor. It has also beenshown that Cav 1 is located in close proximity to the microsatellite markerD7S522 on chromosome 7q31 a region which frequently attracted atten tion in prostate cancer LOH studies. The absence of caveolin 1 mRNA andprotein expression in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and theobservation that a 400 bp fragment of the Cav 1 promotor is methylated atleast in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 prompted us to analyze themethylation status of the Cav 1 promotor in prostate cancer cell lines. Sequencing of bisulfite modified genomic DNA revealed frequent methyla tion of four out of seven CpGs in the region tested. In order to evaluate thefunctional relevance of this promotor methylation we prepared chimericluciferase reporter constructs bearing a SssI methylated as well as anunmethylated 356 bp Cav 1 promoter fragment. After transient expressionin a prostate cancer cells line we observed a significant decrease in pro moter activity of the SssI methylated construct compared to the reportergene driven by the unmethylated Cav 1 promotor fragment. These resultssuggest that regulation of caveolin 1 gene expression may be controlled at least in part by methylation of only a few CpG dinucleotids in the Cav 1 promotor region. ,2001
325,E cadherin belongs to the cadherin family of calcium dependent cell adhe sion molecules. The cadherins mediate cell adhesion differentiation migration and intercellular cell signalling. Given these essential roles it hasbeen postulated that changes in E cadherin expression may account forchanges in cell cell interaction concerning inflammatory dysplastic and finally neoplastic conditions. In long standing colitis ulcerosa a precan cerous inflammation likely predisposing to the development of colorectalcancer hypermethylation of the p16 promotor has been observed as anearly occuring event in neoplastic progression. Presently we analyzed thehypermethylation status of the E cadherin promotor ( 94 to 210) in a col lection of 70 ulcerative colitis samples and 70 controls. 80% of dysplasticsamples showed E cadherin hypermethylation while this status was notedin only 20% of the controls. This finding suggests that E cadherin consid ered a tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer may play a comparablerole in additional pre neoplastic stages of the digestive tract. ,2001
326,Aberrant CpG island hypermethylation has been shown to be associatedwith gene inactivation in cancer. Recent reports demonstrate that the pat terns of CpG island methylation in different neoplasias are non randomand tumour type specific. We have investigated the extent of DNA methy lation in neuroblastomas using methylation sensitive Restriction LandmarkGenome Scanning (RLGS). A novel NotI EcoRV fragment containing aCpG island was found to be methylated in neuroblastoma cell lines. Thisfragment was mapped to chromosome band 1p13 and the correspondinggene identified as the human orthologue of the murine homeobox gene Alx3. Extensive methylation sensitive sequencing analysis of the promoterregion of Alx3 in four neuroblastoma cell lines indicated methylation dependent reduced expression of the Alx3 gene in these cell lines. Fur thermore treatment with the methylation inhibitor 5 aza 2ÃÂ«deoxycytidineinduced expression of Alx3 in four neuroblastoma cell lines in which thePosters: Cancer Genetics 117Alx3 gene was hypermethylated and silenced. We have demonstrated using methylation sensitive PCR that hypermethylation of the putative pro moter region of the Alx3 gene occurred primarily in advanced stage butrarely in limited stage primary neuroblastoma tumours. Our data indicatethat in neuroblastoma tumours hypermethylation of the human homeoboxgene Alx3 correlated with disease progression and in neuroblastoma celllines hypermethylation of Alx3 correlated with reduced expression. Thus hypermethylation represents an epigenetic mechanism which may substi tute for deletion in altering expression of cancer related genes in neurob lastoma. ,2001
327, magdeburg.deDICE1 is located in a LOH critical region on chromosome 13q14 and is acandidate for a tumor suppressor gene. The gene DICE1 is expressed inhuman heart lung liver brain kidney and skeletal muscle. It has beenfound that DICE1 is downregulated in lung and prostate tumors underlin ing that this gene is a tumor suppressor gene. To explain this downregula tion the DICE1 upstream sequence was analysed for methylation in vari ous non small cell lung and prostate tumor cell lines. This sequence showsa high G/C level and is rich in CpG islands. Computational analysis indi cated two promoter like domains one of them with a TATA box. In thesepromoter regions various binding sites for transcription factors like SP1 AP1 NF 1 GATA ETF Oct and c Myc were found. An accumulation ofbinding sites is observed 100 400 bp upstream of the cDNA start. Bothpromoter regions show several restrictions sites for methylation sensitiveenzymes. By analysis of lung tumors with methylation sensitive enzymes amethylation pattern corresponding to the expression level was found. Thetumor cell line SW900 shows high expression and is hypomethylated incontrast to the low expressing Calu 3 and SK Mes1 which are hyperme thylated at all investigated restriction sites. No expression and hyperme thylation was found in prostate tumor cell lines LNCaP and Du145. Theseresults suggest that 1) DICE1 located in a LOH critical region on chro mosome 13q14 is downregulated in tumor cells 2) methylation may be the2nd event in tumor progression.

328,Prostate cancer is one of the most devastating male neoplastic diseasesin the developed countries. Digital rectal examination (DRE) and serumprostate specific antigen (PSA) levels are currently used for the detectionof prostate cancer. However the former relies on the examiner s subjectivejudgement and the sensitivity of the latter is still sub optimal. A novelmethod with higher detection ability is warranted. It has been reported thathypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoter region upstream ofGSTP1 gene is common in prostate cancer tissues and this genomic alter ation could be used as diagnostic index for diagnosis for prostate cancer. In this study we developed a protocol incorporating methylation sensitiverestriction enzyme digestion and the innovated real time PCR strategy toevaluate whether hypermethylation of this region could be used as amolecular diagnostic index for prostate cancer. Our data showed thathypermethylation of the promoter region of the GSTP1 gene was observedin all 21 prostate cancer tissues analyzed yet not in 24 of 25 (96%) sam ples from subjects with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Based on thecurrent results it was concluded that hypermethylation of the 5 promoterregion flanking the GSTP1 gene could be a candidate molecular index forprostate cancer diagnosis. ,2001
329,Literature suggests that in sporadic gastric carcinoma microsatellite insta bility (MSI) phenotype is strongly correlated with hMLH1 promoter hyper methylation. Fifty seven sporadic gastric carcinomas classified as MSI H(n=28) MSI L (n=12) and MSS (n=17) were analysed for hMLH1 promot er methylation status in order to verify this association. Also the presenceof mutations in the repetitive sequences of some target genes TGFb RII IGFII R BAX and TCF4 was analysed. Possible correlation betweenhypermethylation of hMHL1 and mutations in these target genes wereexamined. A statistically significant difference in hMLH1 methylation statuswas observed between MSI H cases (75% hypermethylated) and MSI Lcases (50% hypermethylated) in contrast to 0% hypermethylation in MSScases (P=0.0001). A significant association was also found between thepresence of mutations in target genes and hypermethylation of hMLH1(P=0.0001). Mutations in the target genes were found in 21 cases (TGFbRII) 11 cases (BAX) 8 cases (IGFII R) and 4 cases (TCF4). Methylationof hMLH1 in these tumours was seen in 86% 91% 88% and 75% respec tively. MSI H tumours had mutations in the repetitive sequences of targetgenes in 85% of the cases. MSI L tumours were indistinguishable regard less of the methylation status from MSS tumours concerning (absence of)target gene mutations. ,2001
330,Drug discovery and disease diagnostics is being transformed by the intro duction of new technologies such as microarrays and bioinformatic solu tions. Utilization of a microarray format for analyzing copy number changeswith a resolution dependent on the map position of the DNA within thegenome will allow for analysis of somatically acquired variations. The BACmicroarrays available from Spectral Genomics Inc. provide a set of uniqueclones giving a 3Mb coverage over the genome. Each of the BACs containa mapped sequence tag and most of them have been FISH mapped toconfirm the locations and uniqueness. The array provides a format for highsensitivity analysis where the variation between normal genomic DNAsamples is less than 5%. Further comparing the normal genomic DNAfrom a male and female sample provides a consistent 1 2 copy numberchange with a variation of less than 5%. Utility of the BAC microarrays asapplicable for genomic profiling in cancer will be shown based on resultsobtained from breast tumor samples. Known cytogenetic variations are118 Posters: Cancer Geneticsconfirmed based on an entire genome profile while identifying novel regions of amplifications and deletions. As little as 1ug of total genomicDNA labeled with distinct fluorochromes is used and hybridized with thearray for 4 hours. The sensitivity of the array will be shown through a seriesof titration experiments along with comparisons of experimental proce dures to reduce non specific binding and background noise. Automatedanalysis of the arrays based on SpectralWare software quantitativelydetermines the levels of amplifications and deletions affecting individualarrays elements. ,2001
331,DNA microarrays and oligonucleotide array Gene Chips offer new oppor tunities to monitor the effects of pharmaceutical compounds on humancells. Gene Chips permit the simultaneous monitoring of the activities ofthousands of human genes and this technology has been particularly use ful for analyzing gene expression profiles in cell and tissue cultures. Wehave applied Affymetrix Gene Chips to define the transcriptional responseof human epithelial T 24 cells to Ginkgo biloba extract. Ginkgo bilobaextract treated cells showed increased levels of reduced glutathione anddecreased synthesis of DNA. Quantitative analysis of hybridization signalsfrom Gene Chips revealed net induction of transcription in the T 24 cellsover a period of 72 hours in the presence of the extract. Functional classi fication of affected transcripts revealed changes in the expression of genesencoding antioxidant proteins vesicular membrane proteins and transport DNA synthesis repair cell cycle and transcription. The gene expressionprofile may define for the first time the effects of Ginkgo biloba extract ongene expression of a human cell line and may explain some of the phar macological properties of the extract. ,2001
332,Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in theUnited States. Development and progression of cancer is accompanied bycomplex changes in patterns of gene expression. The development of col orectal tumors is a multistep process that is known to depend on the dereg ulation or mutation of certain critical genes. Therefore colorectal tumorsprovide an excellent system for the research of different gene expressionpatterns because clinical and histopathological data suggest that mostmalignant colorectal tumors(carcinomas) arise from preexisting benigntumors (adenomas). Complementary DNA arrays provide a powerful toolfor studying these complex phenomena. To measure variations in geneexpression between different stages of colon carcinomas metastasis andnormal colon tissue we used cDNA arrays carrying a global human cDNAset of 75.000 non redundant genes. Poly (A)+ RNA from tumor metasta sis and normal colon tissue was reversed transcribed into radioactivelabelled first strand cDNA and hybridized to two filters each. Array expres sion data for colon or metastasis versus normal colon tissue confirmedoverexpression of several genes known to be upregulated e.g. lamr1 (laminin receptor 1 a 40s ribosomal protein ) and downregulated e.g. cea cam7 ( carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule ) in coloncarcinomas. Other known genes with interesting functions that have notpreviously been descriped to be implicated in colon cancer were found up or downregulated in the tumors and the metastasis. . In addition manyESTs with unknown names and functions have been found up and down regulated. Knowledge of gene expression patterns typical for certain typesand stages of tumors will give insight into tumorgenetics. Molecularchanges involved in tumor development and progression will providemolecular markers for tumor diagnosis and clinical prognosis. Finally dif ferently expressed gene products offer a promising stategy for testing newtargets in colon cancer therapy. ,2001
333,The elucidation of the genetic changes of cholangiocarcinoma is veryimportant for understanding the molecular mechanism of carcinogenesisand progression of cholangiocarcinoma. In order to identify the gains orlosses in the copy number of DNA sequence in cholangiocarcinoma weused comparative genomic hybridization to study 33 cases of cholangio carcinoma. The whole DNAs from each tumor tissue were labeled with dif ferent fluorochromes and then simultaneously hybridized to normalmetaphase spread chromosomes. An image acquisition system was usedto quantitate the signal intensities contributed by tumor and reference DNAalong the entire length of each chromosome. Regions of amplification anddeletion were demonstrated as quantitative alterations. The losses wereprevalent on chromosome regions 19p 19q and 22q and the gains fre quently occurred on 8q and 4q. The minimal regions of overlap for dele tions were assigned to 1p36(TNFR2) and 17p13.1(p53) and 9p13 22(p15 p16). Minimal overlapping amplified site could be seen at 13q14.1 q34(RB1 RAP2A) 12q12 q14(CDK2 CDK4 MDM2) and 4q21 q25(FGF5 EGF). This study has provided a detailed comparative genom ic hybridization map of cholangiocarcinoma documenting new geneticchange and also genetic divergence has been revealed in this poorlyunderstood group of cancer. ,2001
334,Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is the commonest human malig nancy . Although genetic studies have established that activation of thesonic hedgehog signalling pathway (SHH) plays a key role in BCC devel opment very little is known about the identity of SHH regulated targetgenes. Using cDNA array technology we have established mRNA expression pro files of BCC samples and in human keratinocytes in the presence andabsence of recombinant SHH. For the identification of SHH target genes two types of cDNA arrays wereused i) High density human UniGene cDNA arrays for global expressionprofiling from RZPD (www.rzpd.de). These filter arrays represent about 32000 different EST clones selected from the UniGene EST database . ii) Weproduced filter arrays containing about 100 selected candidate SHH targetgenes. Differential hybridisation of both filter array types with cDNA from BCC andnormal skin and SHH treated and untreated keratinocyte samples led tothe identification of a number of genes either responisve to SHH signallingor differentially expressed in BCC versus skin samples. Selected resultswere verified by Northern blots and/or real time PCR analysis. ,2001
335, erlangen.deSeven CCRF CEM cell lines selected by step wise drug exposure forresistance towards doxorubicin vincristine methotrexate or hydroxyurea resp. have been analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization(CGH). These cell lines were compared to parental drug sensitive CCRF CEM as well as to other 15 T ALL lines not selected for drug resistance. The resistant lines revealed distinct patterns of genomic imbalances. Lossof distal bands of chromosome 9p was shared by all sensitive and resist ant CCRF CEM lines as was gain of chromosome 20. Gain of distal bandsof 21q was seen in four resistant sublines. Other imbalances were com mon in two or three sublines or seen as single differences as compared toPosters: Cancer Genetics 119parental CCRF CEM. Among those were amplification of 5q12 q14 in methotrexate resistant cells and of 7q21 in vincristine resistant ones. These chromosomal regions harbor the drug resistance genes DHFR amdMDR1 resp. Other differences of resistant CCR CEM lines were also seenas compared to other T ALL lines. Our future efforts aim at those imbal ances with still unknown candidate genes conferring drug resistance.

336,Since the description of low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) in 1987 the histologic and cytologic features of this tumor type are now well estab lished and LGFMS has been accepted as its own entity. LGFMS is a raresoft tissue tumor histologically deceptively benign yet carrying a metasta tic potential. Knowledge of the molecular cytogenetic background ofLGFMS is restricted to one published case with a ring chromosome. Weapplied comparative genomic hybridization to evaluate DNA copy numberchanges in eleven LGFMS cases. Nine cases were found to exhibit DNAcopy number changes. The most prevalent change was loss of chromo some 13q21 q22 seen in six cases. Loss of 13q21 q22 although notpathognomonic of LGFMS indicates a tumor suppressor gene(s) in thisgenomic region to be involved in the pathogenesis of LGFMS. ,2001
337,Ninety seven primary renal tumors of different subtypes have beenanalysed applying Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH). Samplesincluded clear cell (n=47) papillary (n=15) chromophobic (n=13) andoncocytic subtype (n=16). In addition to known subtype specific changes new imbalances not reported yet in significant frequencies were found. Within the group of clear cell RCCs we found a high proportion of tumorsshowing gains of chromosome 1q (28%) and 8q (19%) loss of chromo some 9 (30%) and 4 (21%). Within the group of papillary RCCs we foundadditional gain of copy number of chromosome 3 (33%). The genetic find ings were correlated with pathological and clinical data (grading / staging /tumor size / survival / smoker/non smoker characteristics of the tumor andoccurence of metastasis). Breakpoint regions assessed by CGH that arepotentially involved in tumorigenesis or tumor progression will be dis cussed. ,2001
338,The genetic changes in ganglioneuroblastoma which represents an inter mediary stage between neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma are notknown precisely. We have defined the genomic gains and losses as wellas their chromosomal locations of the ganglioneuroblastoma samplesbelonging to 5 cases (3 male 2 female) in between ages of 3 4 by com parative genomic hybridization and two step degenerate oligonucleotideprimed polymerase chain reaction (DOP PCR). Gains in chromosomes2p5.1 pter 5p15.1 p15.3 +7 13q22 q31 +22 were detected in 3 of ourpatients as minimal common regions while gains in chromosomes 1p35 4p15.1 10q11.2 q21.2 12q24.32 qter +13 17p12 p13 ve 18p11.35 pterwere displayed in 2 of our patients. No oncogenes were reported to belocated in the chromosomal region of 13q21 q31 previously. This regionmay harbor a novel oncogene which contributes to the initiation and pro gression of ganglioneuroblastoma. Furthermore whole chromosomeamplification of chromosome 22 which was detected in 3 of our patients and which has not been reported in previous studies on neuronal tumors may play a spesific role in the progression of ganglioneuroblastoma withthe YESP SIS PDGB NRALS2 oncogenes it harbors. ,2001
339,Ionizing irradiation to the skull is a known risk factor for meningioma devel opment. Skull irradiation for treatment of tinea capitis was applied from1948 1960 in Israel to about 20 000 new immigrants mostly children anda subset of irradiated individuals subsequently developed meningiomas. To gain insight into the genetic factors that determine susceptibility todeveloping radiation induced meningiona (RIM) we characterized thesomatic genetic alterations in 16 RIMs by employing comparative genom ic hybridization (CGH) and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 spo radic occurring non radiation induced meningiomas (non RIM). Most ofthe tumors (29/33 87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alter ation and 11/33 (33%) revealed 4 or more changes. The mean number ofDNA copy number changes was 2.4+/ 1.9 in RIMs and 2.5+/ 1.9 in non RIMs a statistically insignificant difference. The most common deletionswere noted in chromosome 22 (9/16 Ã¢\x80\x94 56.2% in RIM and 8/17 47% in non RIM) and chromosome 1 (6/16 37.5% in RIM and 6/17 Ã¢\x80\x94 35.3% in non RIM) with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy a gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 were noted in RIMtumors only. In conclusion no significant differences were noted betweenradiation induced and non radiation induced meningiomas regarding themean number of genetic changes the extent and frequency of chromo somes 22 and 1 deletions. It seems that the tumorgeneic pathways ofmeningioma formation are similar regardless of previous skull irradiation. However the apparent preferential involvement of chromosomes 8 and 12in RIM is intri guing and requires further investigation. ,2001
340,Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the most commontype of familial CRC. Germline mutations in one of DNA mismatch repair(MMR) genes are known to be responsible for the HNPCC phenotype. Their mutations induce microsatelite instability (MSI). Approximately 12 17% of the unselected tumors also show MSI. The aim of this study was totest two possible methods for detecting the microsatelite instability in ourgroup of patients silver staining of denaturing polyacrylamide gels andautomated fluorescence detection (ALF Pharmacia). A total of 91 patientswith colorectal cancer have been included in the current study subgroupedinto six main categories HNPCC suspected HNPCC family cases juvenile cases sporadic cases and patients with Family Adenomatous Polyposis. Highly efficient set of five markers D2S123 BAT26 D5S346 BAT25 and D18S35 have been selected for detecting the MSI. The mark ers D2S123 (CA repeat) and BAT26 (polyA repeat) were chosen to be test ed in the current study. The repeat markers were amplified from both nor mal and tumor DNA samples and were resolved by denaturing polyacry lamide gel electrophoresis and detected by the two different methods. Wefound 10 microsatelite unstable tumors with markers D2S123 and nan,2001
341, jena.deIn order to select the optimum therapy for patients at risk for recurrent blad der cancer it is necessary to know the pathway of recurrence development. However the origin of recurrent bladder cancer is controversely discussed. Therefore the aim of our study is to define the clonal origin of recurrenttumors of the bladder using molecular genetic markers. Nineteen caseswith recurrent bladder cancer (1 4 recurrences per case) were investigat ed by microsatellite analysis using 4 markers for chromosome 9 D9S747 D9S162 D9S171 D9S1198. PCR was performed according to standardprotocols followed by gele electrophoresis and automated analysis usingan automated DNA Sequencer (LI QOR). In 14 out of 19 cases losses ofheterozygosity (LOH) occured at least in one tumor. Identical LOH wasdetected in 10 cases. In all these cases the same allele was affected. Dif ferent LOH pattern was found in 4 cases showing LOH only in one tumor. LOH of different alleles did not occured. In 5 cases no alterations weredetected using these markers. Our results show that the majority of blad der cancer recurrences is characterized by monoclonal origin. These dataindicate that recurrence is caused by cell dissemination from the originaltumor. For that reason an early therapy should be performed aftertransurethral resection. ,2001
342,Mutations of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes induce a generalizedinstability of DNA particularly evident at microsatellite loci. Because of theirrepetitive structure microsatellites are particularly prone to replicationerrors and microsatellite instability (MSI) is thus a sing of MMR deficiency. We studied 15 patients with rectum cancer and 14 patients with colon can cer. DNA was extracted from normal and cancerous tissue with using fenol chloroform extraction and proteinase K incubation. It was analyzed formicrosatellite instability (MSI) using 5 markers (BAT25 BAT26 BAT40 D2123 and D18S57) by radioactive method. Tumors showing MSI in atleast 3 of 5 microsatellite loci were defined as MSI(+). We determined MSIin 4 patients with colorectal cancer (13 8%). Three tumors are localized incolon and one tumor is localized in rectum. Furthermore we studied methi lation pattern of MLH1 promoter in four patients who are determined MSIpositive. We observed hypermethylation in two of them (50%). The presentreport supports the role of hypermethylation is major mechanism of MLH1gene inactivation in MSI positive colerectal tumors. Consequently hyper methylation mechanism is an alternative to mutational inactivation of MMRgenes. ,2001
343,Hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) describes a diversegroup of families that share a common predisposition to colorectal cancer in the absence of any premalignant phenotype. The genetic basis of this disease has been linked to mutations in genes associated with DNA mis match repair. A large proportion of families harbour changes in one of twogenes hMSH1 and hMSH2. Approximately 35% of families that adhere tothe Amsterdam Criteria do not appear to harbour mutations in these DNAmismatch repair genes. In this report we present data from a large seriesof HNPCC families and indicate that there are subtle differences and sim ilarities between families that harbour germline changes in hMSH2 com pared to those harbouring hMSH1 mutations. Furthermore there are dif ferences between the mutation positive group (hMSH2 and hMSH1 com bined) and the mutation negative group of families. The major findingsidentified in this study focused primarily on the extra colonic disease pro file observed between the mutation positive families and the mutation neg ative families. Breast cancer was not over represented in the mutationnegative groups. There was no difference in the age of the colorectal can cer diagnosis between the hMSH2 and hMSH1 mutation groups but therewas a significant difference between these two groups and the mutationnegative group. ,2001
344,Dominantly inherited mutations are identified in 5 10% of patients with col orectal cancers. Unlike in polyposis coli (APC) mutation search in mis match repair (MMR) genes in HNPCC (Hereditary non polyposic coloncancer Lynch syndrome) is time consuming and costly due to locus andallele diversity. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and immunohistochemicalanalysis (IHC) in patients meeting the Bethesda criteria facilitate the iden tification of constitutional MMR mutations which may have direct implica tions for treatment and prognosis. To evaluate MSI and IHC testing for theidentification of HNPCC we analysed 21 unrelated patients meeting theAmsterdam/Bethesda criteria. The MSI test identifies genomic instability bycomparing constitutional and tumor DNA with a standard battery of 5microsatellite markers. IHC determines presence/absence of expression ofthe hMLH1 and hMSH2 proteins in tumor. Seven individuals (33 %) hadabnormal results. In all four Amsterdam+ families both tests were patho logical and led to subsequent identification of mutations in hMLH1 (3) orhMSH2 (1). IHC and MSI results were concordant in all cases and com patible with the underlying molecular defect in the four Amsterdam+ fami lies. Three patients meeting only the Bethesda criteria were positive onMSI and IHC mutation identification has been initiated. MSI and IHC test ing allows more rapid para clinical diagnosis and renders molecular inves tigation time and budget efficient by targeting specific families for germlinemutation research. This multi step approach is well perceived by bothpatients and clinicians and fosters the pluridisciplinary approach neededin these families.

345,Microsatellite instability (MSI) is associated with defects in the DNA Mis match repair (MMR) system. MSI was detected in several forms of humancancer including haematological malignancies especially in therapy relat ed leukaemia. We have investigated the presence of MSI in 66 patientsincluding 57 AML and 9 MDS (18 therapy related 8 secondary 10 old and30 denovo). Twelve separate microsatellite loci including three mononu cleotide repeat markers (BAT 25 BAT 26 and BAT 40) were used. Tumours were considered as RER+ when they showed instability in atleast three loci or one of the mononucleotides. Buccal mucosa was usedto obtain the corresponding germline DNA for 53 patient. In 13 therapy related patients there was no normal DNA available and MSI was testedonly in the BAT markers. Microsatellite loci were amplified by PCR. Theproducts were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followedby silver staining. Genetic instability was detected in 24 (36.4%) patients 21 of the 57 AML (36.8%) and 3 of the 9 MDS (33.3%). The rate of RER+was significantly higher in the therapy related and secondary patients com pared with the de novo and old ones. Five out of 8 (62.5%) secondary and9 out of 18 (50%) therapy related showed RER+ in comparison with 3 outof 10 (30%) old and 7 out of 30 (23.3%) de novo. Our data suggest thatgenetic instability is an important event in the development of the AML andMDS especially therapy related and secondary malignancies. ,2001
346,Neurofibromatosis type1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disordercaused by mutations of the NF1 gene. It is characterized by multiple neu rofibromas pigmentation anomalies and a variety of other possible com plications including an increased risk of malignant neoplasias. The NF1gene product neurofibromin that is a large protein a member of the nega tive growth regulatory proteins called tumor supressors. Neurofibromin hasa GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain which has shown significanthomology between the catalytic region of mammalian Ras GAP. It is alsocalled GAP related domain (GRD) that interacts with the Ras protein to becrucial in regulating the mechanisms of signal transduction and cell prolif eration/differentiation. GRD is encoded from exons 21 27a on NF1 mRNA. To date most of the reported NF1 mutations are predicted to result in pro tein truncation but very few studies have correlated the causative NF1mutations with tumor formation in NF1 patients. Therefore we analyzed theexon 21 27a DNA from 10 NF1 tumours by using SSCP technology. Dur ing the analysis of NF1 GRD electrophoretically abnormal fragments weredetected. Direct sequencing of these fragments allowed us to identify thepresence of variations and we used these data for further search. We alsoplan to compare tumor and nontumor developed NF1 patient s DNAs forthe same exons in order to determine to extend of variability present intheir NF1 gene. ,2001
347,Previously we described a family with renal cell cancer and a constitution al balanced t(2 3)(q35 q21). Based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH) andVon Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene mutation analyses in five tumour biopsiesfrom three patients in this family we proposed a multistep model for RCC development in which (nondisjunctional) loss of the translocation derivedchromosome 3 (der(3)) may act as a primary oncogenic event and somat ic mutation of the VHL gene as a secondary event related to tumour pro gression. Here we describe the cytogenetic and molecular analysis ofthree novel tumours at early stages of development in two members of thisfamily. Again loss of the der(3) chromosome was found in two of thesetumours and a VHL mutation in one of them. In the third tumour however none of these abnormalities could be detected. These results suggest thatyet another (epi) genetic event may precede the observed der(3) loss andVHL gene mutation in the development of this type of familial renal cellcancer. ,2001
348,Constitutional hemizygous inactivation of PTCH the Shh/Ptch signalingpathway gene which moderates Shh signalling manifests itself as NevoidBasal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS) or Gorlin syndrome a conditionvariably characterized by a number of developmental disorders and mal formations and by predisposition to certain malignancies where the mostfrequent are basal cell carcinomas medulloblastomas and ovarian fibro mas. The PTCH gene a human homologue of the Drosophila segmentpolarity gene patched maps to chromosome 9q22.3 and loss of heterozy gosity (LOH) at this site in both sporadic and hereditary basal cell carcino mas and meduloblastomas suggests that it functions as a tumor suppres sor. Our studies of LOH in sporadic ovarian fibromas for the same regionand aberrant SSCP pattern in sporadic ovarian fibromas contribute to theptch role in their genesis as well. In our studies we used DNA from freshtissues and blood leukocytes which were typed for several short tandemrepeat polymorphism s spanning chromosome 9q21 q31 and by SSCPanalysis we have been analyzed variability in PTCH exons. LOH for thePTCH region has been found in odontogenic keratocysts the cyst typewith highly increased incidence in NBCCS. Suggestive temporal distribu tion of Shh signalling recently observed during tooth development lead usto investigate its association with dentigerous cysts the other major non inflammatory cyst of odontogenic origin. We report here that PTCH is inac tivated in dentigerous cysts the implication being the same gene for theirgenesis as well. More generally PTCH alterations may prove to be a nec essary and perhaps the initiating event in formation and growth of variousnoninflammatory cysts especially with our observations of incomplete het erozygosity which we interpreted as LOH in this region for ovarian dermoidcysts. This would be consistent with our view that local PTCH inactivationcan under predisposing circumstances lead to persistent though not byitself truly aggressive cell proliferation. ,2001
349,Background. TP53 gene mutations play a significant role in the develop ment and progression of astrocytomas. De novo glioblastomas often showoverexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein. Aprevious study of low grade pediatric astrocytomas showed a high fre quency of TP53 gene mutations but not in residual tumors that showedprogression. Material and methods. TP53 gene mutation analysis was per formed in 3 pediatric malignant astrocytomas (MA) and 4 glioblastomas(GBM) using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis mutation detectionassay. P53 protein expression and EGFR expression were assessedimmunohistologically using commercial antibodies. Results. TP 53 muta tions were observed in 2 GBMs which showed limited and extensive p53protein expression respectively. One of them also strongly expressedEGFR. One MA showed strong EGFR expression in combination withintermediate p53 protein expression without gene mutations. Intermediatep53 protein expression without gene mutations and without EGFR expres sion was found in 1 MA and 1 GBM. Discussion. Both TP53mutations thatwere found are possibly causative as they result in a non conservativeamino acid substitutions. In one case the mutation involves the replace ment of the last base at the 3 end of exon 5 probably affecting correctsplicing of the mRNA transcript. The mutation at codon 248 in the othercase is a known mutational hot spot in many tumors and codes for aregion of the p53 protein involved directly in contacting DNA. The samemutation has been reported several times in glioblastomas of adults. TP53mutations and p53 protein expression did not parallel each other. More over EGFR expression occurred together with p53 expression and a p53mutation. This suggests that the pathways in children may be different fromthose in adults. ,2001
350,We have been analyzing molecular genetic alterations of the Gorlin syn drome or Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS) region chro mosome 9q22.3 in ovarian fibromas the trird tumor by incidence in thesyndrome. Gorlin syndrome or Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome(NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes to basal cellcarcinomas of the skin medulloblastomas and ovarian fibromas and wide spread developmental defects. Syndrome related disorders have beenattributed to alterations of PTCH gene a human homologue of theDrosophila segment polarity gene patched which maps to chromosome9q22.3. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at this site in both sporadic andhereditary basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas suggests that itfunctions as a tumor suppressor. The aim is to confirm the tumor suppres sor role of the ptch in genesis of ovarian fibromas even when they are notsyndrome related. DNA was isolated from fresh tissues and blood leuko cytes. The DNA samples were typed for several short tandem repeat poly morphism s spanning chromosome 9q21 q31 in tumors (ovarian fibroma)and matched constitutional tissues. Polymorphic markers D9S127 D9S287 D9S180 and D9S196 and 20 PTCH exons were used. Wescreened for allelic loss and by SSCP analysis we have been analyzingvariability in PTCH exons. PCR reactions were performed and productswere fractionated on 6 12% polyacrilamide gel. We found LOH in 30% ofsporadic ovarian fibromas. In about 70% of ovarian fibromas variability inSSCP pattern was detected. LOH for the ptch region and aberrant SSCPpattern confirmed the expectations that the gene patched has a decisiverole in the genesis of ovarian fibromas when they are not syndrome relat ed. ,2001
351,Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations have recently been reported in Ampullary carcinoma indicating that the Wnt signaling pathway isinvolved in the development of this tumor. However b catenin and AXIN2 the two key players in this pathway have not been investigated in thistumor. Here we show that 4 of 40 carcinomas of the papilla of Vater har bor b catenin mutations and 4 others contain AXIN2 mutations. All the b catenin mutations affect the conserved GSK 3b phosphorylation sites inexon 3 while three out of the four AXIN2 mutations were frameshift muta tions resulting in deletion of the DIX domain. The remaining one was a 12bp deletion removing four amino acids in the PP2A binding domain ofAXIN2. Both AXIN2 and b catenin mutations were found not to co exist inthe same tumor indicating that either one of the mutations is sufficient fortumorigenesis in the papilla of Vater. Immunohistochemical staining of b catenin showed focal nuclear or cytoplastic accumulation of b catenin intumor tissues with b catenin or AXIN2 mutations. Taken together this is thefirst study to demonstrate that b catenin or AXIN2 is mutated in Ampullarycarcinoma and suggest that mutations int these two genes response fortumorigenesis in 20% Ampullary carcinomas through the elevation of b catenin in tumor cells. The biological impact and the mechanisms of thesemutations in the carcinogenesis of the papilla of Vater remain to be eluci dated. ,2001
352,The primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous groupof disorders characterized by a failure of the hematopoietic progenitors todifferentiate normally resulting in ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesisof one or more cell lines. MDS is considered to be preleukemic state andin this context it provides an opportunity to study molecular mechanismsthat precede the development of leukemia. Molecular lesions underlyingthe evolution of MDS are largely unknown. Mutations of RAS genes havebeen found in variety of human hematologic malignancies including 5 % to30% of patients with MDS. The Ras gene family consists of three genes H Ki and N Ras genes which encode p21 ras proteins. They function asGTP buinding proteins with intrinsic GTP ase activity. Usually oncogenicactivation of Ras arises through missense point mutations in codons12 13(exon 1) and 61(exon 2). It is yet not clear is the role of Ras genesmutations in childhood and adult MDS (leukemogenesis) is the same. Wehave studied the frequency of N Ras point mutations in 20 pediatricpatients with MDS. Archival bone marrow samples were screened by DNAamplification followed by single strand conformation polymorphism(SSCP) at both exon 1and exon 2 of N Ras. . One patient has showedabnormal band shift for exon 1 and two for exon 2 suggesting that role ofN Ras mutations in childhood MDS may be significant. ,2001
353,"Retinoblastoma is a chilhood tumor of the eye that affects about 1/13 500 1/25 000 newborns and occurs as sporadic or hereditary form. This cancerresult from succesive loss or inactivation of the RB1 gene located in13q14.1. This gene encodes for a 110Kd nuclear phosphoprotein (pRB) which plays a major role in cell proliferation control. Different types of muta tions in the RB1 gene have been reported but point mutations are themost common. Even though retinoblastoma is common disease in Mexico(about one case/per month there are not molecular studies about RB1gene mutations and expression in Mexican children. In this study we stud ied 19 patients with bilateral or unilateral retinoblastoma. Genetic and cyto genetic studies were carried out. In addition detection of RB1 gene and itsexpression were done. By using SSCP (single strand conformational poly morphism) assay several polymorphisms were identified in different exons. In all cases the sequence of the polymorphisms showed mutations thatproduced a frameshift on the open reading frame. In just one tumor we didno detect the pRB protein. This kind of work is important because the iden tification of mutations may contribute to basic knowledge of this neoplasiaand furthermorethepossibilityto offer genetic counseling to relatives in risk.

355, lj.siMultidrug resistance the main problem in efficient cancer chemotherapy is mainly caused by increased expression and acquired mutations in P gly coprotein (P gp) encoded by MDR1 gene. P gp is highly expressed on theapical surface of gastrointestinal epithelium suggesting its role in protec tion from xenobiotics. Additional physiological functions for P gp and itsrole in cancer beyond multidrug resistance in chemotherapy are poorlyunderstood. We have therefore analyzed tumor and corresponding normaltissue from 400 patients with previously non treated colorectal cancer forgermline and somatic alterations in MDR1 gene using PCR Conformation al analysis and direct sequencing. We have identified 12 different germlinealterations. There were 4 missense 3 samesense 4 intronic alterationsclose to exon/intron boundary and 1 alteration in promoter region. Weobserved significant correlation of at least two germline polymorphismswith increased lymphoid infiltration in tumors. Two unique germline alter ations identified in normal and corresponding tumor tissue and all somat ic mutations identified only in tumor tissue were associated with colorec tal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI H). There were mis sense frameshift and mutations in the promoter region. Interestedly wefound that in all MSI H tumors with MDR1 mutations both the coding andpromoter regions were mutated. To our best knowledge this is the firstreport of naturally occurring mutations in MDR1 gene. These results sug gest that MDR1 plays an important role in development of at least a pro portion of MSI H cancers and that P gp is involved in immune response incolorectal cancer suggesting its physiological function in immunology. ,2001
356,The aim of our study was to determine loss of heterozygosity (LOH) cod ing instability and single base sequence alterations specific for ovariancancer (OC). To accomplish this a combination of high resolution GeneS canTM software analysis followed by automated DNA sequencing wasused. After optimization the sensitivity of our GeneScanTM system wasbrought down to a single base level as always confirmed by sequencing. In case of long repeats a cloning step using the PCR Script TM Amp SK(+)system was required to precede sequencing in order to successfully readthrough them. Selected DNA repair sequences of ovarian tumor DNA weretested against the matched blood counterparts (DNA pairs). Negligiblecoding instability was found at hMSH3/ex7 (1/62 DNA pairs) and athMSH6/ex5 (0/32 DNA pairs). Unlike coding instability LOH confined tothe tumor was found in 41% (17/37 DNA pairs) of the informative OC casesat hMLH1/exon12. In addition preliminary evidence indicated that such atrend of frequent LOH in OC is likely to extend to other DNA repairsequences as well. Therefore our findings support a critical role for LOHas a mechanism involved in the development of ovarian cancer. On theother hand the occurrence of somatic changes in the coding region ofgenes presumably caused by DNA instability is not likely to account forgene inactivation in OC. ,2001
357,The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of DPC4 loss ofheterozygosity (LOH) in sporadic colorectal cancer. For this purpose weanalyzed 36 cases of human sporadic colon carcinoma and correspondingnormal tissue samples. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) vari able nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis and restriction fragmentpolymorphism (RFLP). Each sample was tested for LOH for each of threeVNTR flanking markers (D18S474 D18S363 D18S46) onto 10% non denaturing polyacrylamide gel LOH was defined by a visible change inallele allele ration in tumors compared with matching normal tissue. Wealso used BspHI MaeI and MnlI RFLP sites for detection mutation in exons8 10 and 11. Informativity (heterozygosity) was observed in 35 (97%) from36 analyzed samples. LOH at the DPC4 locus was detected in 18 (51%) ofinformative tumor DNAs 13 cases of LOH found by D18S474 9 cases ofLOH found by D18S363 and 4 cases found by D18S46 markers respec tively. At the DPC4 exon 11 locus only one patient had mutation in exons8 and 10 did not find mutation. Statistical analysis did not show correlationbetween DPC4 LOH and age or sex of patients with informative tumorsamples. The DPC4 LOH was more frequent in tumors smaller than 5 cmin diameter than in larger ones. Our results support the view that malignant124 Posters: Cancer Geneticsprogression is a consequence of more than one of genetic change and suggest that inactivation of DPC4 gene play a role in a multistep processof colon tumor progression. ,2001
358,Using an animal model for the study of T cell lymphomas frequent loss ofheterozygosity (LOH) was revealed in seven chromosomal regions locatedon mouse chromosomes 4 12 and 19. These regions named TLSR1 7 forThymic Lymphoma Suppressor Region 1 to 7 present their correspondingorthologous regions on human chromosomes 1 (TLSR2 3) 9 (TLSR1 4 5) 10 (TLSR6) and 14 (TLSR7). In order to know if the mouse LOH regionswere maintained in human lymphomas we analysed a set of 44 non Hodgkin lymphomas of the B and T cell lineage for loss of heterozygosityon the corresponding orthologous regions by using molecular microsatel lite markers mapped on each of these regions. All molecular markersanalysed showed LOH in a range between 2 and 11% of the cases thusconfirming all the LOH regions found in mouse thymic lymphomas. Wealso found instability at least in one marker of each region. Three of theregions 1p32 p36 9p21 p22 and 10q23 q24 contain candidate genesp73 p16INK4a and PTEN respectively which are known tumour suppres sors. Mutation analyses of p16INK4a and PTEN genes revealed onetumour with a mutation on p16INK4a whereas no cases with mutations onPTEN were found. This could indicate the existence of other/s suppres sor/s genes near PTEN. In addition the other LOH regions could containunknown novel tumour suppressor genes. ,2001
359, Several regions of LOH in Wilms tumor are known on chromosome 7 11and 16 but until recently no correlation analysis was done between loss atthese loci and tumor histology to characterize the genetic defects leadingto a specific histopathological subtype. For this reason we investigated 19cases of Wilms tumor (4 blastemal 9 stromal 3 triphasic one epithelialand 2 tumors of unspecified histology) with a series of markers and com pared the results to the histology of the studied tumors. We found LOH ofchromosome 11 and 16 only in stromal tumors with a rate of 30% and 18% respectively. LOH of chromosome 7 was found in one blastemal and onestromal tumor. No LOH was found in triphasic tumors possibly because ofthe variety of cell types found in that kind of tumor. There seems to be acorrelation between LOH of chromosome 11 and 16 and stromal tumors. The next step will be the microdissection of the different cell types to lookfor LOH in each of them to compare the results with the histology of thedifferent cell types. ,2001
360, jena.deHuman papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 or 18 are involved in the multistep process of cervical carcinogenesis. Transfection of human primary ker atinocytes (HPK) with HPV 16 or 18 DNA generally gives rise immortalcells. This may be explained by the loss of senescence genes as a con sequence of HPV induced genetic instability. Complementation of thesegene defects by the reintroduction of specific chromosomes results in thereversion of the immortal phenotype. Comparative genomic hybridization(CGH) has shown that chromosome 4 is consistently underrepresentedearly during the immortalising process. The aim of our study is to deter mine a region on chromosome 4 which is associated with senescence inHPV induced tumorigenesis. Microcell mediated chromosome transfers(MMCT) with an entire chromosome 4 and different derivated chromosome4 (der (4)) were performed. As recipients served two HPV positive cell lines(HeLa HPK II). Successful microcell fusion was confirmed by microsatel lite PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization using coatasome 4 probe. The introduction of a normal copy of chromosome 4 induced senescencein 80 100% of the resulting HPK II and HeLa hybrids. In order to localisepotential senescence genes on chromosome 4 we have established 10new donor cell lines with different derivated chromosome 4. We have nowstarted to examine these new donor cells with regard to their ability toinduce senescence in HPK II HeLa recipient cells. ,2001
361,"Oligodendroglioma is a tumour originating from oligodendrocytes themyelin forming cells in the central nervous system. This glioma preferen tially occurs in adults. It is mostly located in cerebral hemispheres with apredilection to the frontal lobe. This lesion accounts for 5 33% of allgliomas. The wide range reported for tumour occurrence reflects inter observer discordance in histological diagnosis. Genetic analysis of oligo dendroglioma has associated 1p/19q deletions to chemosensitivity. No his tological definition for this subgroup has been reported. In order to corre late 1p/19q deleted oligodendroglioma to a histological phenotype weunderwent a retrospective study of 59 formaline fixed and paraffin embed ded gliomas mostly reported as oligodendroglioma in the NeurologicalInstitute London and in the Cliniques Universitaires St Luc Brussels. Chromosomes 1 9 10 17 19 and 22 were studied by microsatellite analy sis in order to define regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). A total of 221p/19q deleted gliomas were identified. Twenty of them share commoncharacteristic histological criteria. This allows to diagnose 1p/19q deletedoligodendroglioma on histological criteria prior to any genetic analysis. Thus a better identification of glioma subtypes and evaluation of theirtreatment can be done even in centres without genetic diagnostics.(', ') Posters: Cancer Genetics 125P0129.

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or allel ic imbalance (AI) has been observed throughout chromosome 22q in dif ferent malignant tumour tissues e.g. breast ovary and colon. We studiedchromosome 22 to find further evidence for a breast cancer susceptibili ty/risk gene and screened it for AI using 13 polymorphic microsatellitemarkers spanning 6.7 Mb along the q arm with average distance from eachother of 0.5 Mb. We used 45 breast cancer patients who did not have evident family histo ry of cancer from the late settlement area of Eastern Finland.

AI was found in 37 of 45 tumours (82 %) and five microsatellite markersshowed AI over 30 % with one marker reaching 55 %. These results con firm the occurrence of a breast cancer tumour suppressor gene in a 1.1 Mbwide region in chromosome 22q13. The highest AI frequency was howev er found somewhat more centromeric than previously reported. ",2001
362,It is well known that cervical cancer is multigenetic disease. As the genet ic alterations are the cause of malignant transformation it is likely that spe cific genetic alterations lead to specific clinical behavior. The aim of thisstudy was to localize chromosome arms that harbor likely tumor sup pressor genes by analyzing loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Also we ana lyzed presence of microsatellite instability (MI) as a result of replicationerrors in malignant cells. To define the regions of interest we studied thepresence of LOH and MI at chromosomes 3p 6p 11p/q and 18q in a seriesof 20 cervical carcinomas. All the tumors were squamous cell carcinomaswith various degrees of differentiation. LOH was observed at regions 6p14 24 18q21.1 qter 3p13 26 11p12 15.2 and 11q13 23 with the frequencyof 50% 30% 25% 25% and 20% respectively. MI was detected in onlyone case on chromosome 3p (3p26) and in 3 cases on 6p (6p21.3 and6p23). Majority of the tumors with LOH and MI were histologic grade II buthad heterogeneous clinical stages. Losses of analyzed chromosomalregions in cervical carcinomas suggest that a tumor suppressor genes inthese regions may be important in the prognosis of the tumor. Low fre quency of MI in our study suggests that this type of genetic alteration benot very often in cervical carcinomas. ,2001
363,Human pancreatic cancer is one of the malignant diseases with the poor est prognosis mainly due to difficulty of diagnosis at the early stage for cur ative operation and lacking of curative therapies other than operations. Toinvent more effective methods for better diagnostic and treatment methodsfor pancreatic cancer patients it is necessary to understand its molecularmechanisms. We previously identified that LOH of 18q at the SMAD4locus along with LOHs on 17p and 12q positively associated with poorprognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. We also found that loss of 18q is an early genetic alteration in human pancreatic ductal carcinogenesis. However introduction of the SMAD4 gene did not suppress the growth ofpancreatic cancer cells that harbor homozygous deletion of this gene. IPMT (intraductal papillary mucinous tumor) is thought to be one of thepremalignant lesions of the pancreas which would transform into carcino mas. A total of 20 IPMTs were analyzed and we observed frequent LOH(7/14 50%) at the SMAD4 locus. However SMAD4 protein was observedin tumor cells immunohistochemically and no mutations of the SMAD4gene were observed in any of the tumors. Introduction of the normal copyof chromosome 18 into pancreatic cancer cells with and without defectiveSMAD4 gene is now under way and our preliminary results suggested theexistence of a gene(s) other than SMAD4 that suppresses cell growth. Identification and characterization of the gene(s) that is a candidate fortumor suppressor will also be discussed. ,2001
364,In our study the roles of two tumor suppressor genes (adenomatous poly posis coli APC and E cadherin CDH1) were investigated in renal cell car cinoma (RCC). Both gene products are components of adherens junction where E cadherin is bound to beta catenin which in turn binds to the cen tral part of the APC protein. Twenty eight human renal cell carcinomastogether with autologous peripheral blood samples were tested for geneinstability. Using specific oligonucleotide primers for exons 11 and 15 of theAPC gene instability was followed by polymerase chain reaction/loss ofheterozygosity (LOH) using RFLP method. E cadherin gene was analyzedby PCR amplification of tetranucleotide repeat polymorphic marker(D16S752) and the alleles were visualized by PAGE/silver staining. Ourresults demonstrate that from 28 tumor samples 15 (53 6 %) were inform ative for Rsa I/exon 11 polymorphic site. From the noninformative sample 2 were heterozygous for MspI/exon 15 polymorphism. The overall propor tion of LOH cases of the APC gene was 47 1 % (8/17). The polymorphicmarker for E cadherin gene was highly informative 26/28 (92 9 %) whileonly 2 of these (7 7 %) demonstrated LOH. Interestingly in another threeRCC samples we detected another type of genomic instability replicationerror (RER). Both samples showing LOH of the E cadherin had also LOHof the APC gene while only one RER+ sample of the E cadherin geneshowed LOH at the APC locus. Pathohistological diagnosis showed no cor relation with molecular data. However multivariate analysis indicatedstrong positive correlation of age and TNM stage with the presence of LOHof the APC gene. Our results suggest that alterations both in APC and E cadherin genes are responsible for evolution and progression of RCC. Genetic changes of the E cadherin gene are less frequent and are associ ated with the APC gene alterations. ,2001
365,"Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer death amongmen in the United States. Because PC is currently detected at an earlystage and only a portion of them will progress to become life threatening there is a great need for understanding the genetic basis for PC progres sion. Such an understanding will aid in the development of tests that canbe used to predict the clinical behavior of each tumor for which optimaltreatment strategies can be designed. For the purpose of identifying genet ic markers that distinguish low from high stage PC we analyzed 24 organ confined (T2NoMo) and 21 locally advanced (T3NoMo) tumors by the com parative genomic hybridization (CGH) method. Smears from fine needlebiopsies were used for study. Our results identified six chromosomalregions that were significantly different in organ confined and locallyadvanced tumors. Locally advanced tumors exhibited a significant gain of3p13 q13 and showed significant losses of 6p21 6q24 27 8cen p23 and10q25 26. In addition low stage tumors showed a significant loss of18q11 12. Our study confirmed the loss of 8p and 10q as the two most fre quent regions of loss in PC as seen in published LOH studies and identi fied several regions of gain or loss not previously reported. Further inves tigation of these regions may reveal genes that are important for the pro gression of PC.126 Posters: Cancer GeneticsP0134.

Rosen thalmetaGen Berlin G', 'Tumor development is characterized by chromosomal disorders whichmay lead to activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressor genes. Ingynecological tumors genetic information within chromosomal region11q12 q23 is often amplified or lost. Assuming that chromosomalrearrangements in tumors cause changes in gene expression four millionESTs available in public and proprietary EST databases were subjected toin silico expression analysis using assembled cDNA sequences (Schmitt etal. 1999). In this first approach 600 candidate genes were identified whichare associated with sporadic forms of gynecological tumors (Dahl et al. inpreparation). Chromosomal assignment of these 600 genes localized 15genes within 11q12 q23. To achieve an even higher coverage of tumor associated genes for this critical chromosomal region we analyzed 968STS markers between RH13699 (11q12) and RH27416 (11q23) forexpression analysis as aforementioned. Using this strategy we identified atotal of 69 genes which are significantly differentially expressed in gyne cological tumors. 47 of these genes have been described previously whereas 22 are novel.

366,Applying a Functional Positional approach we have identified a genomicclone that carries a cell senescence gene SEN6A for ovarian tumor cells. SEN6A locus was previously identified at 6q14 21. The introduction ofchromosome 6 or 6q into human (SKOV.3) and rat (ROSE199 and ROV12)ovarian tumor cell lines led to the restoration of normal cell growth pheno types and senescence. Analysis of spontaneous revertant clones whichoccurred due to deletions in the donor chromosome allowed us to map thelocation of SEN6A locus within a 1cM genetic interval at 6q16.3. Preciselocalization of the deletions allowed us to identify three overlapping YeastArtificial Chromosome (YAC) clones corresponding to the smallest dele tion shared among independent revertant clones. Functional testing ofcandidate YAC clones identified a YAC that restored normal cell growthand senescence in ovarian tumor cells. Following the library screen weassembled a contig of 17 BAC clones corresponding to the complement ing YAC. Candidate BAC clones were tested for function by introductioninto ovarian tumor cells. In these experiments two BAC clones were iden tified to carry SEN6A gene. To further define the smallest genomic region carrying SEN6A three overlapping BACs were subcloned to generate cos mid clones each carrying a 35 50 Kb segment. Cosmid clones have beenassembled in a contig across SEN6A locus. Experiments are currentlyunderway to test cosmid clones for senescence activity in tumor cell lines. These studies not only identify a genomic clone carrying the senescencegene but also demonstrate the utility of the functional approach to identifycell senescence and/ or tumor suppressor genes. ,2001

Two color FISH established the contig orientation and long range mapping verified that the contig faithfully represents theSRO2 region. 68 transcripts have been identified in the map based on ESTscreening and CpG island subcloning.

368, mainz.dePositional cloning strategies combined with comparative genome analysisof human chromosomal region 11p15.5 led to the isolation of a new geneof the transient receptor potential protein (TRP) gene family. Members ofthis family encode calcium channels that can be devided into three sub groups according to their structural features. Comparison of the new tran script with the known trp genes displayed highest homologies to humanTRPC7 and MLSN1 thus classifying it as a member of the l TRP sub group. The novel gene was therefore named MTR1 (= MLSN1 and TRPrelated gene). While activation of o TRPs and s TRPs results in currentsdue to ion influx into cells after agonist stimulation (e.g. via IGF1) little isknown about the function of l TRPs. However the expression of MLSN1correlates with the metastatic process in melanomas and initial studies inC.elegans (ced 11) point to an involvement of l TRPs in cell growth deathand differentiation. As MTR1 maps to a genomic region that is linked withBeckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and a variety of mostly embryonalneoplasias (e.g. Wilms tumors rhabdoid tumors) we currently study therole of the gene in tumorigenesis. We found that increased amounts ofMTR1 mRNA are present in a significant proportion of Wilms tumors. Weare currently looking for mutations in BWS and tumor DNA. Further func tional studies include the search for interacting proteins with a yeast two hybrid assay to elucidate the role of MTR1 in cellular physiology andpathogenetic processes. ,2001

370, kiel.deMature B cell malignancies are characterized by chromosomal transloca tions involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome14q32.3 resulting in deregulated expression of different oncogenes. Chro mosomal translocation t(2 14)(p13 q32.3) is a rare but recurrent event in B cell malignancies whereas gains and amplifications of chromosome 2p13are seen not only in mediastinal and about 20% of extranodal B cell non Hodgkin s lymphomas (B NHL) but also in up to 50% of Hodgkin s disease(HD). We have identified a zinc finger gene (BCL11A) through molecularanalysis of 4 cases of clinically aggressive CLL with t(2 14)(p13 q32.3)using long distance inverse PCR methods. This gene is also commonlytargeted in B NHL and HD with 2p13 amplifications. BCL11A was identicalwithin its zinc finger motifs to another gene (BCL11B) on chromosome14q32.1 and was highly conserved being 95% identical to mouse chick en and Xenopus homologues. BCL11A is the human homologue of mouseevi 9 which is deregulated in murine myeloid leukemias following proviral integration. Like evi 9 there were three major isoforms of BCL11A whichdiffered in the number of carboxy terminal zinc fingers. Two BCL11A iso forms interacted with BCL6 another highly conserved zinc finger geneimplicated in the formation of normal germinal centers and the pathogene sis of B NHL. All three isoforms of BCL11A like BCL6 repressed tran scription. Deregulated expression of BCL11A is thus commonly involved invarious lymphoid malignancies through either chromosomal translocationor amplification and may transform B cells through transcriptional repres sion of the same set of genes involved in the control of B cell differentia tion and proliferation as nan,2001
371, We have studied a balanced constitutional chromosome translocation t(2 3)(q33 q21) observed in lymphocytes of a Polish family in which multi focal clear cell renal carcinoma segregates with the translocation. YAC andBAC contigs were constructed for the 2q and 3q breakpoint regions and allknown STSs and ESTs in these regions were mapped relative to the con tigs. The two BACs crossing the breakpoints were partially sequenced anda consensus sequence assembled using our sequence data as well asHuman Genome Project submissions. The chromosome 2 assembledsequence contained an EST which was extended by 5 and 3 RACE. The resulting ~1.5 kb cDNA contains two exons that are separated by thetranslocation. By RTPCR low level expression was detected in ovary fetalkidney fetal thymus and fetal skeletal muscle. An ~11 kDa protein as pre dicted by the amino acid sequence was detected by in vitro transcriptionand translation. Bacterial and mammalian expression vectors have beenconstructed and transfections of mammalian cells will be described. ,2001

Detailed delineation of the minimally deleted regions (MDRs) in BCLLpatients were conducted by many research groups including our own. Noclear overlaps between MDRs found by different researchers were found although all deleteion are clustreed between D13S1168 and D13S25 STS markers. Two candidate genes DLEU1 and DLEU2 were cloned from the10 kb MDR found by us but no point mutations in them were detected inmore than 150 BCLL patients. We have build a 620 kb cosmid contig thatoverlaps D13S1168 D13S25 region map 8 STS markers on this contigand sequence 17 kb area encompassing 10 kb MDR. We have searchedGenBank with STS markers and revealed several BAC sequences that arepartially cover the region of interest. Sequence analysis reveal that Alu repeats and putative gene fragments are distributed unequally centromer ic flank is rich in Alu (24 8%) and in putative candidate genes (WI 9598 RFP2 DLEU1 DLEU2 and others) telomeric flank centered around STS marker GCT16C05 is extremely Alu poor (only 4 1%) and contains onlytwo expressed sequences. One of them consists of three exons divided byintrons 19366 and 96661 nt in legth. This exons can represent a putativeextremely large gene rearranged or interstitially deleted in BCLL. Anotherinteresting feature of the region is unusual abundance of the Alu subfami ly Y the youngest Alu that is still capable to propagation. ,2001

The chromosomal128 Posters: Cancer Geneticsregion containing this suppressor locus was narrowed down to a ~750kb interval delimited by D12S89 and D12S358. Since no known candidategene was found we initiated the construction of a detailed transcriptionmap focusing on a contig of 4 overlapping BACs. Towards this goal weapplied a strategy integrating several complementary approaches (1)Computer based data mining tools applied to the existing genomicsequence (750 kb) derived form the BAC contig (2) Exon amplification andEST resources to identify putative cDNAs (3) Determination of generalexpression pattern by RT PCR and Northern blotting (4) Comparativegenomic analysis with distant vertebrate species such as Fugu rubripesand Tetraodon nigroviridis. This transcript mapping strategy has identified42 potential transcription units including 2 known genes 5 new genes and35 Unigene entries. The region contains also 6 pseudogenes. This mapshould facilitate subsequent effort to characterize the candidate genes. This study is a good illustration of how the integration of genome basedapproaches facilitates the identification of genes in large interval. ,2001
374,Escape from senescence has been postulated to be a prerequisite for pro gressive tumor growth. Cells cultured from many tumors can proliferateindefinitely while normal diploid cells become senescent after definednumber of generations. Cellular senescence is expressed as a dominantphenotype over immortal cell growth. We have applied a functional posi tional approach to map and isolate human genes that induce senescencein immortal tumor cell lines. A cell senescence gene SEN16 identified onchromosome 16 by microcell mediated chromosome transfer into immortalmammary tumor cells has been mapped within a genetic interval of 3 7cMat 16q24.3 (Reddy et al.1999 Oncogene 18 5100 5107). Six yeast artifi cial clones corresponding to candidate locus were identified and tested forfunctional complementation of immortal phenotype by introducing intomammary tumor cells. These studies led to the identification of a 360 kbYAC (Reddy et al. 2000 Oncogene 19 217 222) In order to construct ahigh resolution map of the candidate region carrying the senescence gene a human BAC library was screened with DNA markers to obtain relevantBAC clones which were assembled in a contig based upon PCR analysis. Some selected BAC clones were retrofitted with a selectable marker andintroduced into human and rat mammary tumor cells for functional com plementation. These results identified a 85 kb BAC clone that carries thesenescence gene. In following experiments we isolated expressedsequences from the complementing BAC clone by exon trapping. Twelveexons were identified and their sequence comparison with databases hasidentified eight partial cDNA clones. Experiments are in progress to deter mine the expression of these clones in tumor cell lines. In conclusion wehave mapped a senescence gene to a 85kb genomic clone and identifiedexpressed sequences from this clone. ,2001
375,Amplification of 3q25 q26 is one of the most frequent chromosomal alter ations in human ovarian carcinoma. A chromosomemicrodissectionÃ¢\x80\x94hybrid selection method was applied to isolate transcribedsequences from a primary ovarian cancer containing high copy numberamplification of 3q25 q26 using 3q26 band specific DNAs generated bychromosome microdissection. Using this method we have isolated a novelcandidate oncogene eIF 5A2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2). EIF 5A2shares 82% identity of amino acid sequence with eIF 5A including the min imum domain needed for eIF 5A maturation by hypusine modification atlysine 50 residue. Amplification and overexpression of eIF 5A2 was fre quently detected in primary ovarian cancers and ovarian cancer cell lines. The proliferation related function of eIF 5A supports that eIF 5A2 is a can didate oncogene related to the development of ovarian cancer. ,2001
376,Deletions on chromosome 6 have been reported in different types of can cer. In gastric cancer two smallest regions of overlap (SRO) have beenidentified Ã¢\x80\x94 one interstitial (6q16.3 q23.1) and one distal (6q26 q27).Recently we delimited the interstitial SRO to a region of 2 cM. To facilitatea search for genes in this region we assembled a YAC contig that coveredthe SRO. We applied a new strategy to analyse the gene content of theregion based on the assumption that many of the human genes presenton the YACs may be expressed in the yeast strain. Thus in a cDNA sub traction protocol using two yeast strains containing different YACs it can beexpected that the resulting pool of differentially expressed cDNAs will beenriched for the genes encoded by the human inserts of the YACs. By sub tracting different YACs from the 2 cM region we isolated 12 human spe cific cDNA clones of which 8 could be confirmed to originate from 6q16.3 q23 based on sequence analysis. The remaining 4 clones specificallyhybridised to the YAC from which they originated. Northern analyses haveshown so far that 4 out of the 12 cDNA clones have expression in differ ent tissues including stomach. ,2001
377,Genotoxicity assay of a number of synthetic as well as natural products ofhuman use are increasingly being taken to screen their qualitative as wellas quantitative effect on various test systems. This has resulted intosearching antimutagenicity and anticarcinogenicity principles to be used asprotective measures against harmful effects of the essential chemicals. The list includes antioxidants scarvengers of free oxygen radicals andMRO species generated in the cellular metabolism. Recent genetic mod els for antimutagenicity assay include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic sys tems and cell lines especially with human tissue culture technique and useof recombinant DNA technology. Taking some steroidal pharmaceutics asmutagens we have studied synergistic as well as antagonistic action ofVitamins of B complex ascorbic acid super oxide dismutase and certainphenolics of plant origin. Metabolic activation system (S9 mix) was used toenhance mutagenicity. Clastogeny SEC and cell cycle kinetics profilessuggest amelioration of genotoxic damage in human lymphocytes and inmice bone marrow cells. Findings will be discussed. ,2001
378,In the framework of a larger research progect concering the Risck Factor sin Lung Cancer we obtained data about family history of thesubjects. There has been interviewed 132 patients with lung cancer and200 without cancer constituting the control group. We obtaind informationabout 905 relatives of probands and about 930 relatives from the controlsgroup. Using the Falconer s formula we calculated the heritability wich hasa value 14%+_ 1.98. This value indicated reduced implication of heredo familial factor s in lung cancer ethiopathogeny being in concordance withdata form the literature. The calculation of the heritability proves to be prop er instrument for quantification in genetic factor s in the common desease. ,2001
379,The mastopathy and breast cancer are disgormonal hyperplastic processin lactic gland. A defining reason of progressing of a mastopathy andbreast cancer are neuro humoral factor stipulated by a stress depression neurosis and environmental factors. As a rule mastopathy and breast can cer suffer the women of age from 25 till 45 years. A number of molecular genetic studies have been conducted to evaluate associations betweenGSTM1 polymorphism and diseases. Polymorphisms at the glutathione S transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene locus have attracted much interest becausethe homozygous condition on GSTM1 deletion (GSTM1 0/0) seems tomodify the risk for different types of cancer allergy and other diseases. ByPCR method polimorphism of GSTM1 gene in 15 patients with mastopa Posters: Cancer Genetics 129thy and 17 with breast cancer was carried out. As control group 45 healthy woman from Bashkortostan were analysed. It was established that the fre quency of GSTM1(0/0) genotype for mastopathy patients was 0 80 and0 58 for brest cancer patients whereas in control group it has constituted0 49. The differences between womans with mastopathy and control groupwere significant (X2 =20 99 p<0 001). ,2001
380,GST (glutathione S transferase) genes (GSTs) are defined as a genesuperfamily including four gene families ? p and ? namely. It is thoughtthat carcinogenesis is associated with the absence of functional GSTM1and GSTT1 which leads to a deficit in detoxification of carcinogens. In thisstudy the effect of GST polymorphism on leukemia was investigated. Patients diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) AcuteMyeloid Leukemia (AML) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) between18 70 years of age consisted of 52 males (55.3%) and 42 females(47.2%) were included in the study. In control group healty 42 males(47.2%) and 47 females (52.8%) at the same age were studied. PCRanalysis were performed with GSTT1 and GSTM1 specific primers ongenomic DNA obtained from peripheral blood samples from both patientand control group after obtaining their informed consent. GSTT1 andGSTM1 genotypes were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis ofPCR products. GSTM1 null genotype was seen in 13 cases of 38 AMLpatients (34.2%) 11 cases of 22 ALL patients (50%) 10 cases of 23 CMLpatients (42.5%) compared to 37 cases in control group. There was noassociation for GSTM1 null genotype between AML ALL CML and controlgroups. GSTT1 null genotype was seen in 11 cases of 38 AML patients(28.9%) 7 cases of 22 ALL patients (31.8%) 6 cases of 23 CML patients(26.1%) compared to control group in which no GSTT1 null genotype wasobserved. A significantly higher incidance of GSTT1 null genotype wasseen in both total patient group and ALL AML CML subgroups when com pared to control. On the other hand no significant correlation wereobserved in the incidence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotype with smok ing family history sex and age parameters in patient group. To our knowl edge this is the first study in which GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphismswere investigated in CML patients and we found an association betweenGSTT1 null genotype and leukemia whereas no association could beobtained for GSTM1 null genotype. ,2001
381,A study of hromatin regins in chromosome 1 9 and 16 was performed onperipheral blood and heteroc bone marrow frome 10 normal individualsand 16 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and actue nonlym phocytic leukemia (ANLL) was studied. The results showed that there wassignificant differences in chromosome 1 and 9 between the CML patientsp < 0.01 and the nomal individuals employed as controls . Analysis of theinversion in chromosomes 1 9 and 16 of CML patients and control groupsin the present study found significant increases in partial and total inver sions in CML patients . the results did not show increases in C Ã¢\x80\x94 band het erochromatin variants in chromosomes 1 9 and 16 ANLL patients com pared to controls. However frequency of complete inversion was noticedto be significantly higher p < 0.05 in ANLL patients compared with controls. ,2001
382,Early detection of hyperdiploid clones is of great significance in diagnosticand prognostic evaluation of children with ALL. However conventionalcytogenetic analyses are often hampered by a low yield of dividingleukemic cells and/or poor quality of chromosomal preparations. Therefore we use for assessment of hyperdiploidy double color interphase FISH (I FISH) with different satellite and/or locus specific probes (VYSIS) for 10chromosomes most commonly gained in hyperdiploid cells. According tomolecular cytogenetics results we divided patients into several subgroupswith different prognosis. During the last 3 years we examined by I FISHprospectively or retrospectively 69 children (46 boys 23 girls mean age8 4 years) with ALL. Among them we found 29 (42%) with high hyper diploidy (>50 chromosomes) 11 (16%) with low hyperdiploidy (47 50 chro mosomes) 2 (2 9%) with near triploidy/tetraploidy and 4 (5 8%) withunspecified hyperdiploidy. In 23 (33 3%) of patients hyperdiploidy was notascertained. In all patients we analysed at least 200 interphase nuclei andthe extent of hyperdiploid clones was 2 5 Ã¢\x80\x94 95%. (Cut off level 2 5% wastested on controls). Small clones under 10% were detected in 17 (24 6%)of patients. In 4 cases where the presence of chromosomal rearrange ments was suspected by G banding mFISH with probes and isis softwarefrom METASYSTEMS was performed. Significance of small side cloneswith hidden hyperdiploidy detected by I FISH and presence of chromoso mal rearrangements for patient s prognosis will be discussed.

383,Acute promyelogenous leukemia (APL) is a clinical subtype of acute myel ogenous leukemia (AML) characterized by a translocation involving theRARa gene on 17q12 21 and five other genes reported to date PML at15q21 RARa gene PML at 15q21 PMZL at 11q23 NuMA at 11q13 NPMat 5q35 and STAT5b. We report an unusual case of AML in a 48 year oldwoman who had ecchymoses a high white count (29.8 bil/L) with 55%myeloblasts anemia (Hb 8.9 gm/dL) and thrombocytopenia (65 bil/L).With no coagulopathy at presentation. Marrow examination revealedreplacement of normal marrow by leukemic blasts with reniform nuclei andcytoplasmic granulation Auer bodies but without increased hypergranularpromyelocytes. A variant APL (M3v) was suspected but interphase FISH using a PML/RARa probe failed to reveal the classic t(15 17). The patientreceived induction chemotherapy with Idarubicin and Ara C achieving acomplete remission after two courses. She was then treated with high dose Ara C for 4 cycles as consolidation followed by maintenance therapywith Daunorubicin and Ara C. She did well for 21 months then presentedwith neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. A repeat marrow showedrelapsed leukemia. She was reinduced with Mitoxantrone Ara C andEtoposide. Allogenic transplantation is planned after complete remission. At presentation and at relapse the patient had a unique t(11 17)(p15 q21).Further FISH studies using RARa dual color rearrangement probe docu mented that the entire RARa gene was translocated to 11p15 inmetaphases. This novel translocation t(11 17)(p15 q21) has not been pre viously reported in either classic or variant APL. ,2001
384,We report on two patients with MDS transforming to AML which after chro mosome analysis were found to have an interstitial deletion of the long armof one chromosome 15 with an extra copy of the deleted chromosome. Deletion of chromosome 15 is an unusual abnormality in haematologicalmalignancies and after a thorough search of the literature we were onlyable to find one other reported case. A search of the Chromosome Abnor mality Database Oxford UK (CAD) listed a second case. However both ofthese cases have only one copy of the deleted chromosome 15. This is therefore the first report of the duplication of a deleted chromosome 15.We compare our cases with the other two recorded cases in order to deter mine whether a trend exists which may associate this chromosome abnor mality with a particular disease type and prognosis. ,2001
385,A 3 yr old patient presented with a two week history of malaise fatigue intermittent low grade fever bruising and leg pain. He developed massivebilateral proptosis with chloromas of the frontal cranial bones (reminiscentof metastatic neuroblastoma) and gingival hyperplasia. The clinical andpathological diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia subtype 5a suggestedthe non random chromosome abnormality associated with AML M5a i.e.t(9 11)(p21 22 q23). Translocation (9 11) however was not observed. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a pseudodiploid karyotype involving twoinversions within one copy of chromosome 11. The clone comprising themajority of cells analyzed also showed duplication 1q21q32. The remain ing 7/20 cells showed a normal karyotype. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridiza tion (FISH) analyses using probe CCND1 for the 11q13 locus and the MLLprobe at 11q23 clearly demonstrated the double rearrangement confirmingthe GTG banding result of pericentric inv(11)(p13q13) and paracentricinv(11)(q13q25). To our knowledge the phenomenon of two inversionswithin one chromosome has not been previously described. The 11q dele tion or translocation typically associated with M5 clusters around twobreakpoint regions 11q23 24 and 11q13 14. Two of three breakpoints inthis case however are atypical. The 11q25 band is not specificallydescribed in leukemia while the 11p13 band is usually associated withAcute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). In summary although this patienthas chromosome 11 rearrangements the specific breakpoints and thedouble inversion have not been previously described. The significance ofthis complex karyotype is reviewed in the context of the complicated clini cal course. ,2001
386,Chromosome aberrations involving the MLL gene located in 11q23 are fre quently observed in acute leukemias. The aberrations mainly consist oftranslocations with a variety of partner chromosomes. The amplification ofMLL has been described recently only in a few patients. We report 17patients with MLL amplification suspected by G banding and confirmed byFISH analysis. Twelve patients had the diagnosis de novo acute myeloidleukemia (AML) one patient had a de novo myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS) one a secondary AML after MDS and three patients suffered fromsecondary AML/MDS after genotoxic treatment. Eight patients presentedMLL amplification on long uniformly stained regions 6 patients within ringchromosomes two patients on double minute chromosomes and onepatient in form of long uniformly stained regions as well as in ring chromo somes. In all patients FISH analysis with two colour probes for the 5region and the 3 region of MLL showed a cluster consisting of multiplehybridization spots of both probes. Southern blot analysis of four patientswith a probe spanning the breakpoint cluster region of MLL did not revealany rearrangements. To explore the expression of MLL we performedsemi quantitative RT PCR and real time RT PCR in 11 of our 17 patients. In comparsion to the relative levels of MLL expression of bone marrowcells from healthy volunteers and AML patients without 11q23 rearrange ment the 11 patients wih MLL amplification did not show an overexpressionof MLL. Our based on Southern bolt analysis using only a probe spanningthe breakpoint cluster region of MLL suggest that the amplification of 11q23does not involve a rearranged copy of the MLL gene. As our RT PCRresults did not show high level expression of MLL it could be speculatedthat the MLL promoter and enhancer sequences which have yet to beidentified and characterized may not be amplified with the codingsequence. ,2001
387, Chromosomal abnormalities are often difficult to characterize completely inhematologic neoplasia. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we find that 37%of the patients with clonal chromosome aberrations show an incompletekaryotype by G banding. As clonal chromosome aberrations are of inde pendent prognostic significance and karyotype analysis in AML is used asan up front investigation for treatment stratification in our institution it wasimportant to obtain a complete karyotype. By single or oligotarget FISH itwill be impossible to characterize but a few cases money and amount ofmaterial being the limiting factor. With a success rate (obtainment ofmitoses) of nearly 100% in AML multitarget FISH becomes an attractivesolution as an adjuvant diagnostic tool. From November 1 1997 tillNovember 1 2000 we investigated 95 cases of AML. M/F ratio 0.78 medi an age 66 years (16 88 years). By SKY the abnormal clones were detect ed in all cases but 4 (few abnormal G band mitoses). The SKY extendedor confirmed the G band findings in 96%. All marker chromosomes except3 were characterized. Cryptic translocations (translocations not suspectedfrom the G band karyotype) were found in 26 cases. The chromosomesmost often involved in G band and SKY aberrations respectively were #5 #21 #7 #8 #17 and #5 #8 #7 #17 #21 in descending order. We findSKY a powerful adjuvant diagnostic tool that in contrast to molecular bio logical techniques does not compromise one of the advantages of kary otyping techniques the analysis of the entire genome in one investigation. Data to be presented will be updated. ,2001
388, beThe AML10 protocol is a randomized study of induction and intensive con solidation followed by stem cell transplantation allogeneic or autologous. All FAB types except M3 were eligible. A total of 2 157 pts were included 915 by EORTC (E) and 1 242 by GIMEMA (G) members. Cytogenetics atdiagnosis was peer reviewed. Excluding unknowns (43 E 338 G) notdone (37 E 148 G) failure or insufficient mitoses (150 E 353 G) valid datawere obtained for 1088 patients (pts) (685 E (75%) and 403 G (32%)).1 038 pts were evaluable for response 402 (39%) had a normal karyotype(>= 20 mitoses) and 636 (61%) an abnormal one. Among abnormal cases the following changes were found t(8 21) (15 %) inv(16) (15%) translo cation 11q23/MLL (7%) t(9 11) (3%) +8 (15%) 7 (8%) 5 (4%) 7q (5%) 5q (4%) abnormalities of 3q (7%) t(9 22) (3%) del(12p) (2.5 %). A totalof 111 (17.5%) pts had a complex karyotypes (> 3 aberrations) half ofthem with aberrations of chromosomes 5 and 7. Overall survival (OS) rateat 3 yrs was 40%. The Cox s model showed that the cytogenetic findingswere the strongest independent prognostic factor followed by age andWBC. Pts with t(8 21) and inv(16) had the best outcome OS rate of 60%.The worst outcome was related to 7 5 12p and t(9 22) followed byt(11q23) and 7q . Additional analyses identified cytogenetic subgroups andallowed refined assessment of reason for treatment failure. In conclusion karyotype appears as the strongest independent prognostic factor for out come. ,2001
389,Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant disease which effects imma ture or undifferentiated myeloid cells and is characterised by their accu mulation in bone marrow and pheripherial blood. It has different geneticabnormalities involving numarical and structural anomalies of chromosome11. Recently a tumor suppressor gene the multiple endocrine neoplasiatype 1 gene (Men1) was cloned and mapped to chromosome 11q13. Muta tions of the Men1 tumor suppressor gene cause the multiple endocrineneoplasia type 1 (Men1) syndrome in humans and they are involved in aPosters: Cancer Cytogenetics 131variety of sporadic human tumors. To assess the potential involvement of this gene in the patogenesis of myloid leukemia we analysed the Men1deletions in myeloid leukemias. This was achieved by using fluorescencein situ hybridization with Men1 cosmid gene probe in interphasenuclei. With this technique reliably detected the Men1 gene in interphasenuclei of myeloid leukemias. *This study was supported by Selcuk Univer sity Research Fund ,2001
390,Rearrangements of the MLL gene on chromosome 11q23 account forapproximately 5 10% of acquired karyotype abnormalities encountered inchildren and adults with acute lymphoblastic acute myeloblastic poorlydifferentiated or biphenotypic leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. To date at least 40 different 11q23 translocations have been determinedcytogenetically and at least 25 MLL fusion partner genes have beencloned. Rapid detection of MLL gene translocations at diagnosis is of clin ical significance and can be easily accomplished by a recently developeddual color FISH method that allows the detection of MLL/11q23 rearrange ments in metaphase and interphase nuclei even in cases with 3ÃÂ« MLL dele tions. This assay is appropriate for the analysis of MLL involvement how ever detection of the involved fusion partner gene is limited to sampleswhere metaphases are available and impossible in cases with 3ÃÂ« MLLdeletions. We have adapted this FISH assay for the detection of specifictranslocations involving different MLL partners. Using various gene locus specific BAC clones in combination with the MLL probes we have alreadyestablished FISH assays for the detection of translocation partnersAF4(4q21) AF6(6q27) AF17(17q21) and MSF(17q25) and the develop ment of further assays for AF9(9p22) AF10(10p12) and other MLL part ners is under way. In general the FISH probes are set up in a way that spe cific translocations result in two fusion signals and in one fusion signal incase of a 3ÃÂ« MLL deletion in metaphase and interphase nuclei. Theseassays will facilitate studies of specific translocations by interphase FISH. ,2001
391,Chromosome aberrations affecting band 3q21 namely the inv(3)(q21q26) the t(3 3)(q21 q26) and the t(1 3)(p36 q21) are associated withmegakaryocytic dysplasia normal or elevated platelet counts and a par ticularly unfavourable prognosis for the affected patients due to poorresponsiveness to chemotherapy. Their diagnosis is therefore of great clin ical importance. This prompted us to develop a molecular assay that canbe used to confirm or exclude 3q aberrations suspected on the basis ofclassical cytogenetic analysis and to monitor disease progression. Sinceno fusion genes are consistently associated with any of the 3q21rearrangements and overexpression of the EVI 1 gene in 3q26 is also notstrictly correlated with the presence of the inv(3) or t(3 3) RT PCR assaysare not suitable to confirm and/or track these chromosome aberrations. Wetherefore developed an interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) assay in which separation of red and green fluorescent probes thatcolocalize in normal interphases indicates the presence of a 3q21rearrangement. This assay was validated on three cell lines and 25 primarysamples from different leukemias with and without 3q21 aberrations andwas shown to be highly sensitive and specific. ,2001
392,Deletions of the long arms of chromosome 5 are common findings inhematological malignancies in particular in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML). The size and position of delet ed segment vary among patients but band 5q31 is commonly deleted inmost of them. Although del(5q) sometimes occurs as a sole chromosomalabnormality more often it is present with additional chromosomal changes. On the contrary translocations of 5q were found to be rather sporadicevents in MDS. In our study we followed 39 patients (29 men 10 women average age 60 6 years) with MDS/AML with deletion 5q and complexchromosomal rearrangements by FISH methods. In the first group ofpatients (9) whole chromosomal painting probes (WCP) were used todetermine the chromosomal partners in translocations. In the secondgroup (30 patients) FISH with 5q31 locus specific probe confirmed deletionof this chromosomal region in all cases except one and we suspect 5q31as a primary cytogenetic lesion. We were able to detect chromosomalinstability of deleted chromosome 5q by FISH with WCP probes and mul ticolor FISH (mFISH) using multicolor probes specific for all chromosomes.mFISH revealed cryptic aberrations reciprocal and terminal translocationsand small insertions to various chromosomal partners (chromosome 7 asthe most frequent) fragmentations of deleted long arms of chromosome 5was also frequently found. In all patients complex rearrangements of 5qwere connected with poor clinical outcome. This work was supported bygrant GA CR 302/98/0071 and CEZ J 13 98 111100004 M? MT CR. ,2001
393,We report on a currently 59 year old male chronic myeloid leukemia patientwith a rare variant Philadelphia translocation t(9 10 22)(q34 q22 q11). Flu orescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome paints was used toconfirm the cytogenetic findings. With a BCR/ABL specific probe the knownrearrangement on the derivative chromosome 22 could be found. VariantPhiladelphia translocations may result from a two step process with pri mary formation of the classical rearrangement and a second aberrationevent or a one step complex chromosomal rearrangement based onsimultaneous chromosomal break events. Our results showed no evidencefor a second break event of one of the involved chromosomes but a twostep process can not be ruled out completely. Variant Philadelphia translo cations involving chromosome 10 are rare and the majority of chromosome10 breakpoints of variant Ph translocations cluster to chromosomal sub 132 Posters: Cancer Cytogeneticsband 10q22 and 10q26. The prognostic implications as well as the rele vance of the additional breakpoint region 10q22 are discussed. ,2001
394,The response of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to the treat ment with Interferon can be evaluated by cytogenetic analysis using thenumber of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph1+) and negative (Ph1 )cells to classify the cytogenetic response as complete (no Ph1+ cells) major (less than 35% Ph1+ cells) minor (equal or more than 35% Ph1+cells) or no response (equal or more than 95% Ph1+ cells). We have per formed a cytogenetic study in 24h non stimulated cultures of bone marrowcells from 18 patients with CML at diagnosis during and after treatmentwith Interferon. 9 patients presented cytogenetic response and 9 patientshad no response to treatment. In this study we evaluated the presence ofchromosome instability (CI) i. e. the presence of chromosome and chro matid breaks and rearrangements. For the 18 patients studied the resultsshowed that 1. CI is observed during and after treatment with Interferonand not at diagnosis 2. the presence of cells with CI was higher in thegroup of patients that had cytogenetic response (6/9) than in the group ofpatients that had no response (3/9) 3. considering all the studies together the presence of cells with CI was higher in occasions of complete cytoge netic response (7/8) than in occasions of minor (3/10) and no response(1/6) for major response we observe the presence of CI in 7 out of 14occasions. This results suggest that the presence of chromosome instabil ity in CML patients treated with Interferon may be related to good cytoge netic responses. ,2001
395,A case of an atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia in a Filipino child ispresented. At diagnosis the seven year old boy had mild anemia hyper leucocystosis with granulocytes in all stages of maturation eosinophil of16% and normal megakaryocytes. Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase waszero. Using the GTG banding technique the absence of Philadelphia chro mosome was noted in all cells analyzed. The involvement of 7q31 and9q34 was observed. Using the fluorescence in situ hybridization whole chromosome probes it was established that the segment of chromosome7(q22 qter) translocated to chromosome 9 at or near 9q34. No transloca tion of the broken segment of chromosome 9 has been observed to 7 or toany other chromosome. The involvement of 7q31 and 9q34 in this translo cation suggests a novel gene fusion in chronic leukemogenesis. ,2001
396,We used Vysis LSI bcr/abl extra signal (ES) translocation probe to studyFISH signal patterns in CML and ALL patients in Singapore General Hos pital. From 1999 to 2000 we studied 51 consecutive CML cases and found12 cases (23.5%) with deletion of ASS region giving 1R1G1F signal 1 ofwhich had small deletion of ASS region giving 1R1dimR1G1F signal. Twoother cases (3.9%) with 1R1G1F signal were found to have maskedPhiladelphia chromosomes due to insertion of BCR into ABL region. Theremaining 37 cases showed the usual 2R1G1F fusion with no deletion ofASS region. Deletion of ASS region in Philadelphia chromosomesappeared to confer a poorer prognosis for CML patients. In ALL patients using the similar ES FISH probe we found 4 cases of t(9 22) which gavedouble fusion signals 1R1G2F and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)study showed that these cases were due to minor bcr p190 e1a2/e1a3.Two ALL cases gave 2R1G1F signals and PCR showed that they hadmajor bcr p210 b2a2/b3a2. We concluded that using the ES FISH signalprobe in interphase nuclei and metaphase spreads the incidence of ASSdeletion in CML patients was found to be 23.5% in Singapore and its sig nal patterns could apparently differentiate the major bcr from minor bcr int(9 22) ALL. ,2001
397,Among 518 cytogenetic studies done in hematological malignancies wehad 52 failures (10%). Normal results represented 290 cases (56%) expected when controlling remissions or in uncertain diagnosis. Differentaberrations were found in 176 cases (34%). The total number of studiedpatients is 386 many of them have repeated controls the pediatric popu lation is 78 (20 2%). The most frequent reference diagnosis were acutemyeloid leukemia (15 2%) chronic myeloid leukemia (12 3%) acute lym phoid leukemia (11 6%) myelodysplasia (11 2%) and multiple myeloma(7 6%). The most common cytogenetic finding was t(9 22)(q34 q11) in 76studies (43%) either isolated or with additional aberrations. We also per formed FISH studies in 57 patients in 25 cases with X and Y probes forcontrol of grafting of bone marrow transplantation with a non sex matchedrelative in 15 cases in search of t(9 22)(q34 q11) with 13% positive results in 14 cases looking at del13q14 in multiple myeloma with 57% positiveresults and in 3 cases for t(15 17)(q22 q21) with 1 positive result. Weintend to clarify some complex cases with many marker chromosomes withmultiple FISH or comparative genomic hybridisation. ,2001
398,Leukemia in infants has been defined as a rare event arising in stem cellsof early hematopoietic differentiation up to their first year of life. We pres ent a series of eight patients with acute leukemia including three cases ofneonatal leukemia < a month of age. We excluded two Down Syndromewith somatic mosaisism of low proportion (12% in PB) associated casesdiagnosed as biphenotypic and lymphoblastic leukemia . These patientsshowed a 100% +21 in the bone marrow aspirate while the leukemoge neous reaction was present. Bone marrow aspirates and/or peripheralblood were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with fetal calf serum andwithout mitogen stimulation. Cases were GTG banding analyzed and kary otypes were established according to the ISCN. These were characterizedby a higher incidence of structural aberrations such as t(4 11)(three cases)and del(7)(q21 qter)(two cases) add(2q) (one case). The remaining twocases correspond to a normal karyotype and to a numerical alteration(+5 +22). Sex ratio was 5 3 showing a little preference of affected girls. Sixpatients were diagnosed as AML while the other two were ALL and Biphe notypic leukemia. We conclude that cytogenetic studies are very importantto differentiate those Down related cases with leukemogeneous reactionwhich will spontaneously remit from those acute leukemias with chromo some rearrangements of poor prognosis. Determination of the neoplasticcell genotype is a relevant parameter to establish the correct therapy. ,2001
399,The majority of B cell malignancies bear chromosomal translocationsbetween the immunoglobulin (IG) genes and oncogenes leading to dereg ulation of the latter. IGH at 14q32 is most frequently involved whereastranslocations of IG kappa (IGK) at 2p12 and IG lambda (IGL) at 22q11have been described in 5 10% of the cases. The most reliable method todetect translocations affecting a promiscuous locus is Fluorescence In SituHybridization (FISH) with differentially labeled probes flanking the break point. As no break apart probes have been available for IG light chain loci we designed two novel FISH assays to detect translocations involving IGKand IGL. BAC clones flanking each breakpoint were differentially labeled. False positive ratios were calculated from experiments on healthy donors being 0.3% for IGK and 1.4% for IGL. We tested twenty five cases of B cellmalignancies with cytogenetically detectable chromosomal abnormalitiesat 2p11 14 (n=13) and 22q11 12 (n=12). FISH revealed IGK involvementin six of 13 cases (46%) with cytogenetically detectable 2p11 14 break. Translocation partners were chromosome bands 7q21 8q24 (three cases) 10q24 and 16q24 containing the B cell associated oncogenes CDK6 c MYC NFKB2 and c MAF respectively. In 6 of 12 cases (50%) with cyto genetically detectable 22q11 12 alteration FISH indicated a breakpoint in the IGL locus. Translocation partners were 3q27 (BCL6) and 8q24 (c MYC)as well as chromosomal regions 2p13 2p16 4q13 and 16p12 (oncogenesunknown). The new FISH assays provide a flexible simple and reliable toolto detect IGK and IGL translocations providing an important means for theclinical management of lymphoma patients as well as for the identificationof new B cell associated oncogenes.

400, kiel.deBlastic peripheral B cell lymphoma (BBCL) is a biologically and clinicallyheterogenous group of lymphoid neoplasms. No reliable criteria for sub classification of BBCL for clinical practice are currently available. We thusinvestigated whether a subclassification of BBCL is possible on the basisof recurrent genetic aberrations detected by chromosome analysis andFISH. There was a significant difference in the frequency of changesaffecting the IgH locus in 14q32 in the morphologic variants of BBCL. Near ly half of the lymphomas of centroblastic (cb) subtype but only 25% of thelymphomas of immunoblastic (ib) subtype had a breakpoint in 14q32(p<0.04). The translocation t(11 14) occured in all blastoid mantle cell lym phomas (bmcl) and was restricted to this subtype. In ib lymphomas t(8 14) t(11 14) and t(14 18) were present significantly less frequently thanin Burkitt s lymphomas bmcl and cb lymphomas respectively. Moreover cytogenetic and FISH analyses revealed the IgH translocations in ib lym phomas to be predominantly those characteristic for B CLL liket(2 14)(p13 q32) affecting the BCL11A gene or t(14 19)(q32 p13) involvingthe BCL3 locus. There were also significant differences in the frequency ofchanges affecting other chromosomal regions ib lymphomas containedpredominantly deletions in 8q and 14q changes of 4q and losses of chro mosome 10 cb lymphomas showing gains of chromosoms X 7 and 18 losses of chromosomes 13 and 15 changes of 1p36 1q 3q27 8q and11q bmcl showing losses in 1p21~31 and 9p gains of 3q21~24 or com plete chromosome 3. Multivariate analysis revealed deletions in 1q42~qter duplications in 1q23~32 trisomy 5 and changes of 15q as independentprognostic factors in cb lymphomas. In ib lymphomas changes of 7q and8q showed an adverse effect with even stronger impact on survival thanthe International Index. These findings underline that genetic aberrationsmight help to define biologically and clinically distinct entities of BBCL.

401,"The occurrence of Robertsonian translocations is rarely encountered inhematopoietic malignancies. We identified five patients carrying a Robert sonian translocation suffering from persistent leukopenia with a low valueof vitamin B12 in their serum progressing to anemia and thrombocytope nia. The bone marrow and the trephine biospy specimene revealed amyelodysplastic syndrome not fitted to any type of FAB classification. Standard PHA stimulated cultures of peripheral blood showed the translo cation in 100% of metaphase cells with a modal number of 45 chromo somes including X and Y. Chromosomes were G banded and 40metaphases analysed. C banding was also performed. The three types ofRobertsonian translocation were t(13 14)(p11 q11) in three out of five (3/5)and t(14 21)(p11 q11) and t(13 13) (p11 p11) in the other two patients. We suggest that these patients had two oncogenic advantages 1. The Robertsonian translocation itself is associated with genetic insta bility.2. The low value of vitamin B12 since it is known that it can interfere todouble strand DNA break. In conclusion we suggest that carriers of Robertsonian translocation havean increased risk of aquiring a hematological malignancy. 134 Posters: Cancer CytogeneticsP0176. Molecular Cytogenetic Analysis of the Monoblastic Cell Line U937 J. Lee Y. Cho C. Lee S. Shim H. Seo J. Khym College of Medicine Hanyang University Seoul Republic of K', 'The cell line U937 was derived from the pleural fluid of a patient with dif fuse histocytic lymphoma and the cells phenotypically resemble blast cellsof the monocytic lineage.

402,At our department cytogenetic analysis of NHL patients has been done formore than one decade. Using the REAL classification system the cytoge netic data bank of patients with B NHL was searched for the most frequentchromosoal aberrations. The analysis was focused on the four largestdiagnosis groups of B NHL CLL DLBL follicular lymphoma (FOLL) andMCL. Klonal cytogenetic aberrations were found in 97 of 111 CLL 87 of109 DLBL 66 of 76 FOLL and 31 of 43 MCL. Only cases with chromosomechanges (281 in total) were taken into account for analysis. Frequencies ofprimary and secondary aberrations were determined for the different NHL subgroups and in addition the incidence of non random associationsbetween primary (f.e. t(11 14) t(14 18)) and secondary chromosomalchanges was looked for. According to the new WHO classification systemthere are now only 2 grading subgroups (based on morphological criteria)remaining in follicular lymphoma (1+2 and 3 of the REAL classification).Cytogenetic data seems to not entirely support this change. ,2001
403,Trisomy 3 was found to be a recurrent numerical chromosomal change inlymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Differentfrequencies however have been reported and the pathogenetic role of tri somy 3 remains unknown. In the present study we examined archivalparaffin embedded tissues from 26 well documented cases of surgicallyresected primary gastrointestinal MALT lymphomas for the occurrence oftrisomy 3 and 12 by bicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization on isolatedinterphase nuclei and tried to compare the results with the clinical out come. The collective includes 14 men and 12 women with a mean age of60 years (male 41 83 female 21 85). 12 cases were classical low grademarginal zone MALT lymphoma 1 case showed a low and high grade lym phoma component (mixed type) and 13 cases were diffuse large B celllymphoma of MALT type (high grade). The lymphoma were staged accord ing to the modified Ann Arbor system by Musshoff. Six patients presentedwith stage EI1 8 with EI2 10 with EII and one patient with stage III and IV. According to control experiments on nuclei from reactive tissues the cutofflevel for trisomies was set at 15% nuclei with three signals. No trisomy 12was found and trisomy 3 was detected only in 4 of 26 (15%) MALT lym phomas including 2 low grade and 2 high grade lymphoma. Two patientshad a lymphoma recurrence and died during the follow up period. We con clude that in our series trisomy 3 showed low occurrence and was found inboth low grade and high grade MALT lymphoma. We speculate that tri somy 3 might correlate with increased recurrence rate in patients with gas trointestinal MALT lymphomas but this needs further investigations. ,2001
404,Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal resessive chromosome instability disorder characterized by a variety of congenital anomalies and a high inci dence of bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia) as well as increased rateof malignancies including leukemias and solid tumors. FA patients areconsidered preleukemic and the disorder presents a model for the study ofthe etiology of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloidleukemia (AML). During bone marrow failure in FA patients clonal chro mosomal aberrations are detectable in bone marrow cells of the patients. Today the prognostic value of the variety of this genomic imbalances is notknown however it seems that they differ to these found in non FA patientswith aplastic anemia MDS and AML. In our institute more than 50 FA patients were diagnosed for FA. Most of these patients take part on a longterm follow up including yearly conventional cytogenetic (CC) analysis ofthe bone marrow. In most of the cases clonal numerical and structuralchromosomal aberrations could be detected. Chromosome aberrations arefurther characterized in detail by molecular cytogenetic techniques as flu orescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microdissection and comparativegenomic hybridization (CGH). Additionally for some patients we were ableto collect further data on karyotype evolution of different clones due to sev eral bone marrow analyses. Main objective of our study is to uncover theorigin of unknown additional chromosomal material and the detection ofpartial losses of chromosomal segments by different molecular cytogenet ic strategies. The data collected gives us the opportunity to find possiblelinks between chromosomal imbalances bone marrow failure andMDS/AML in FA patients. ,2001
405,Analysis of telomere length is performed in malignant cells in which telom eres usually gradually shorten and are stabilized only upon activation oftelomerase. In rare cases an extreme expansion or complete loss of indi vidual telomere occurs. These individual differences cannot be detectedusing the most common technique TRF (Southern hybridization of termi nal restriction fragments) which is able to show only an average size oftelomeres. Therefore an in situ labeling technique (dideoxy PRINS) wasused for detailed analysis of telomeres in childhood leukemia and multiplemyeloma samples. PRINS utilizes an unlabelled probe (in this case Telo2 (CCCTAA)7) which hybridizes to its target seguence and serves as aprimer for chain elongation using Tth DNA polymerase to incorporatelabeled nucleotides. Dideoxy PRINS is more specific for labelingsequences which lack one or more of the four bases of DNA the base(s)can be added in the form of dideoxynucleotide(s). For evaluation of telom ere dynamics samples were also assayed for telomerase activity usingTRAP assay (telomere repeat amplification protocol) and for expression oftelomerase reverse transcriptase and RNA subunits using RT PCR. In ourpresentation we show examples of our recent results e.g. observation ofa single telomere expansion (about 9 fold elongation with respect to theaverage length of all the other telomeres on a given metaphase) on chro mosome 4 arm q in one of childhood leukemia samples. Besides currentresults of telomere analysis of childhood leukemia and multiple myelomaare shown and discussed in relation to possible regulatory mechanisms oftelomere maintenance. ,2001
406,Telomeric region of the chromosomes are involved in the maintenance ofgenomic integrity. Telomeres compensate for the chromosomal shorteningas it happens after each round of cell division. Because of the dynamics oftelomeric DNA replication telomeres are thought to influence the progressof cellular senescence and cancer progression. Not unexpectedly it hasbeen reported that telomeres are shortened in acute leukemias where thecell turnover is high. B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a partic ularly interesting haematological malignancy in regard to telomere dynam ics because most of the malignant cells in CLL are mitotically inactive. Inthis study we aimed to evaluate the length of telomeric sequences inpatients in B cell CLL by the ddPRINS technique. Twenty patients with CLL(female/male 5/15 mean age 62.05Ã¢\x80\x938.48) and four healthy donorslyomphocytes as our control group (female/male 1/2 meanage 60.03Ã¢\x80\x9312.05) were included. We found short telomers and nodetectable telomeric repeats at the sites of chromosome fusion. In thepatient group we observed less intense telomeric signals than the controlgroup. We are in the opinion that reduced telomeres in CLL reflects thedominance of malignant cells with an abnormally long life span. Thesecells may have encountered many antigenic stimulants in the past andhence underwent multipl clonal expansions. Our findings imply that short ened telomeres in CLL may be reflecting the history of the disease andserve as an independent prognostic factor. ,2001
407,Background Intracellular Epstein Barr virus (EBV) exists as either stableintegrated into the genome or as covalently closed episome circularizedvia the terminal repeats (TR). The integration of DNA viruses into the hostgenome is frequently associated with immortalisation and malignant trans formation of human cells whereas episomal copies are not linked to tumordevelopment. Aim As the two forms of viral persistence are associated with different bio logical features we wanted to work out a simple technique to discriminateboth forms. We applied a DNA spreading technique to enable deeperinsights into the organization of the virus to be able to clearly discriminateboth forms. Methods DNA from the cell line Daudi was prepared according to the pro cedure of dynamic molecular combing. Double target FISH was appliedusing the W fragment and different cosmid probes (kindly provided by Dr. G. W. Bornkamm) covering the whole genome of the virus. The cosmidcovering both terminal repeats (TR) was double labeled with biotin anddigoxygenin thus allowing a simple identification among the rest of theviral genome. Results We constantly observed a non interrupted hybridis ation pattern of the double labeled cosmid spanning both TRs. In case ofan integration of the viral genome into the host we would expect to see aseparation of the hybridization signals. Thus we interpret this picture asfusion of the two TR as it is the case in the episomal form. Conclusion The method applied allows a visualization and unambiguousidentification of the episomal form of the EBV. ,2001
408,"The detection quantification as well as the genetic and functional charac terization of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) present in the bone marrow(BM) peripheral blood (PB) and apheresis products (AP) are becomingincreasingly significant in the treatment of patients with solid tumors bothat diagnosis and during the course of cytotoxic treatment (MRD detection).To overcome limitations due to the current techniques and to enable anexact quantification we have fully automated the screening and relocationprocedure of immunological stained samples (RCDetect MetaSystems).This device allows the simultaneous search for up to three fluorescencesignals. The automatic relocation of immunolabeled cells enable sequen tial genetic (FISH) and also functional analyses of positive cells. With thisapproach tumor typical genetic aberrations such as translocations geneamplifications or simple gains or losses can be identified allowing theunambiguous proof of the malignant nature of the questionable cell. Thesensitivity of the system is only limited by the number of cells available foranalysis. Data on quantitative and qualitative analysis of tumor cells car ried out in over 700 clinical samples (BM PB and AP) from neuroblastomaand breast carcinoma patients will be presented. In addition functionalanalyses e.g. proliferation capacity and apoptotic rate was monitored in alarge series of bone marrow samples with disseminated tumor cells. Withthe help of this computer assisted microscopic system the automaticsearch quantification as well as genetic and functional analysis of lowtumor cell infiltrates in routine bone marrow preparations can be carried outefficiently and reliably.136 Posters: Cancer CytogeneticsP0186.

409,Epidemiological studies of patients previously exposed to ionizing radiationsuggest an increased risk for developing meningiomas. Genetic eventsunderlying such tumorigenesis are unknown. Cytogenetic studies of radia tion induced meningiomas (RIMs) are rare and so far discordant one casewas reported without and one case with loss of chromosome 22 a changefrequently associated with spontaneous meningiomas (SMs). Moleculargenetic analysis using markers from chromosome 22q showed no LOH inthe 15 RIMs studied. There are no comparative genomic hybridization(CGH) studies of RIMs so far. We used CGH to investigate the geneticbasis of 7 RIMs. CGH analysis was done on paraffin embedded tissues ina blinded manner including SMs and normal brain tissue. CGH analysis ofthree RIMs identified common losses of 1p 7p and 18q. Losses of 2p 3p 6q 10q 11q and 11p were present in at least one of the RIMs. Interesting ly 7p loss is infrequently observed in SMs and yet it was present in all ofthe 3 RIMs studied so far(analysis of the other 4 RIMs is in progress). CGHanalysis of one SM demonstrated monosomy 22 loss of 1p 6q 14 18q andgain of 1q. These changes are in accordance with common geneticchanges previously identified by CGH in sporadic meningomas. The iden tification of RIM specific genetic changes is of clinical importance sincethey often show more aggressive behavior with a high recurrence rate fol lowing therapy. The observation of distinct genetic characteristics in RIMsmay also provide new insight into the mechanism of tumorigenesis. ,2001
410,Exposure to ionizing radiations is known to increase cancer risk. Radio therapy may also induce solid tumors. We report the cytogenetic study of7 cases of radiation induced meningiomas 2 cases following irradiation ofchildren with tinea capitis 1 case following radiotherapy of a glioma in a 6months old child 1 case after radiotherapy of an astrocytoma WHO gradeII at age 14 and finally 1 case of temporal angioma 1 case of cranialpharyngioma and 1 case of medulloblastoma irradiated during childhood. The cytogenetic findings included complex karyotypes with numerical andstructural abnormalities. All metaphases showed a der(1) and monosomy22. Molecular cytogenetics using CGH and SKY technique permitted us torefine the karyotype findings del(1)(p11 pter) and del(22)(q12 qter) usingCGH and translocation of a part of chromosome 22 on the 1p13 pcenregion of chromosome 1 using SKY technique der(1)(qter 1p11 22q12 >22pter). The existence of complex chromosomal abnormalities stresses the atypic aspect and the radio induced origin of these tumors. Deletion ofthe short arm of chromosome 1 is frequently observed in meningiomas butwith different breakpoints. The 1p11 region could be implicated in radiationinduced meningiomas in particular. Further molecular investigations of thisregion would be of great interest. ,2001
411,Medulloblastomas a primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum represents approximately 25% of all intracranial tumors in children. Sever al studies demonstrated numerous non randomly chromosomal abnormal ities. However the specific oncogenic events involved in the developmentand progression of this tumor remain unknow. In this study molecular cyto genetic approaches were performed to allow a more comprehensive cyto genetic evaluation of 5 new MB cell lines that we have previously estab lished. Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) we detectedchanges in copy number (gains and losses) in our cell lines. The mostrecurrent chromosomal abnormalities found were gains of 3q 4q 7q 8q 15q 17q and losses of 11q and 17p. Also karyotypes and fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH) were done and show multiple chromosomalrearrangements and polyploidy in accordance with the CGH results. Theseresults reveal many clonal imbalances that had previously been reportedand some novel changes such as 3q 4q and 15q. We also show that thesenew cell lines are cytogenetically representative of the PNET/MB tumorsand should be helpful for further understanding of the biology of thesetumors. This study confirms many of the previously reported cytogeneticdata such as losses of 11q and 17p and gains of 7q 8q and 17q and alsoreveals potentially important novel regions that could be implicated in thetumorigenic process of MBs. Additional studies are needed to furnish moreinsight on the roles played by the changes observed. This project is par tially supported by the Centre de recherche de l H pital Sainte Justine. ,2001
412,Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in chil dren occurring at a rate of about 1 in 10.000 live births. This tumor is char acterised by its unpredictable behavior some neuroblastomas mature andregress spontaneously whereas others progress rapidly and agressively. Genetic alterations found in NB cells beside clinical parameters and theage of patient has a great significance in development and clinical courseof the disease. Molecular and cytogenetic analyses of genetic determi nants in NB cells have an object of establishing precise and prompt diag nosis of NB. Double coloured FISH were performed on tumor imprints withthe probes for centromeric and telomeric region of chromosome 1. Also markers D1S80 and D1S76 were analysed using PCR. Routine cytoge netic analysis were done on G banded chromosomes. Simultaneous com bining of the molecular genetic methods such as FISH and PCR and clas sical cytogenetics will provide making quick precise and prompt diagnosisof neuroblastoma. ,2001
413,Objectives Established genetic factors of aggressive tumor growth in neu roblastomas are MYCN amplification (NMA) deletions at 1p36.3 and anear diploid or near tetraploid DNA content. Recently gain of 17q21 qterwas described to be the most frequent prognostic marker. Another study however suggests that gain of 1q21 23 define a subset of NB with adverseoutcome. We investigated all these prognostic markers in an attempt tocorrelate specific genetic changes and outcome. Patients and methods The tumor collection encompassed 14 primarytumors of all stages and three samples from patients under cytotoxic treat ment. We analyzed the status of 1p36.3 1q21 23 MYCN and 17qter byPosters: Cancer Cytogenetics 137FISH using D1Z1 D1Z2 955E11 (1q21) 910C8 (1q21) and 918H5 (1q23) (M. Rocchi Italy) MYCN D2Z TP53 and 17q25 (probe 946e12 T. Haaf MPIMG Berlin Germany). Results Among the 10 patients with localized/regional (stage 1 2A 2B and 3) or 4s disease all in complete remission we observed none of thechromosomal anomalies mentioned above except two cases exhibitinggain of 17q (totally or sub totally resected tumors). All stage 4 tumors (7patients) displayed at least one of the prognostic markers two tumors frompatients with fatal outcome exhibited gain of 17q as sole genetic aberra tion three tumors (patients in partial remission) displayed NMA 1p36 dele tion and 17q gain and two tumors from patients with fatal outcome werepositive for all analyzed prognostic markers. Conclusion Preliminary results suggest that the simultaneous presence ofall genetic aberrations define a subset of NB with extremely unfavorableprognosis. ,2001
414,Cytogenetic finding in 30 carcinoma eso pts. Carcinoma esphagus thecancer of food pipe forms an important class of cancers. It ranks sixth in tsncidence in the world and makes up about 10% of G. I.T. cancers. Besidesother clinical symptoms dysphagia and epigastric pain are two main symp toms that makes endoscopic study a must. A total of 40 pts complaining ofdysphagia with or without epigastric pain were subjected to endoscopy. 10patients were found to have normal esophagus while 30 patients showeda growth in their food pipe. Biopsis form of growths in all 30 cases werecollected for histopathology and cytogenetic study. Majority of thesegrowths were histopathologically confirned to have cancerous growth. Cytogenetic study carried out in the biopsis collected for this purpose con tained different kinds chromosomal changes. Centromere spreading cen tromere stretching fragmentation ring formation and sickness were themain structural changes. Most of the aneuploid cells contained a Markerchromosome. Polyploid cells had circular arrangement of the chromo somes with a hollow space in the centre. Attempts have been made to findthe etiology of cancerous esophagus by studying the socio economic con ditions and other related environmental factors. ,2001
415,Knowledge of the specific genetic changes in colorectal cancer could beimportant for prognosis and therapy. HT 29 and CX 1 are commonly usedcell lines for in vitro studies of colorectal cancer. In the present study thechromosomal alterations of HT 29 and CX 1 were analysed by spectralkaryotyping (SKY) in order to clarify the complex translocations that couldnot been detected by standard banding techniques. Spectral karyotyping(SKY) is a new sensitive method to detect chromosomal aberations byclassifying each chromosome in different colors. The application of SKYallowed detailed analysis of marker chromosomes in the colorectal cellslines HT 29 and CX 1. We identified common gains (chromosomes 7 11 15 and 20) that were amplified about four times or more in both cell lines. By comparing the two cell lines five similar structural alterations werefound del(4)(q31) i(8q) i(13q) der(17)t(17 19)(p10 q10) and del(18)(q21). Because of this similarity a fingerprint analysis was performedand revealed no differences in the banding pattern between both cell lines. Most of the structural and numerical aberration found in HT 29 and CX 1were identical. A fingerprint analysis revealed a common genetic origin. Obviously both cell lines were derived from the same patient. This resultshave important implications for past and present studies on these colorec tal cell lines because to date these cell lines were thought to be of differ ent genetic origin. ,2001
416,Drivers of public utility vehicles particularly jeepneys which are not air con ditioned are constantly exposed to the hazards of pollution. In this study jeepney drivers were chosen to provide preliminary data on the possibleeffects of this exposure on the sensitivity of chromosomes. Preliminarydata on the mutagen sensitivity of chromosomes from peripheral bloodlymphocytes of thirty five (35) Filipino jeepney drivers are presented. Theperipheral blood samples were cultured following the routine 72 hourmicroculture technique. Five hours before harvest the cells were exposedto bleomycin a radiomimetic agent. Responses to the clastogenic effectsof the mutagen expressed as average number of chromatid lesions orbreaks per cell (b/c) were noted. The mean b/c in the drivers group is 1.46while that of the control group is 0.75. Results also show that 77.14% ofthe drivers showed a b/c value higher than 1.0 which is established as theborderline for mutagen sensitivity. Higher than this value is taken as hyper sensitive to the effects of bleomycin. In the control group only 22.8 % havea b/c value higher than 1.0. If sensitivity to mutagens is considered an indi rect measure of DNA repair capacity these drivers of jeepneys are at highrisk of acquiring environment induced cancer. ,2001
417,Following a previous study of male breast cancer (MBC) (Hultborn et al 1997) performed on archival paraffin embedded tissue we started aninvestigation applying the high resolution comparative genomic hybridiza tion (CGH) technique on fresh material (lymphocytes) from MBC patients. Here we report results from the study of eight men being under current fol low up at the Department of Oncology Sahlgrenska University Hospital G teborg Sweden. The aim of the study was to disclose suspected minor genomic gains and losses specifically in X and Y chromosomes in male138 Posters: Cancer Cytogeneticsbreast cancer patients. One patient turned out to be a Klinefelter (47 XXY) male. Finding one XXY male among such a small group of MBC patientssupports our finding of a closer association between MBC and Klinefelter ssyndrome (Hultborn et al 1997). The aberrations in the Y chromosome ofpatients Nos 2 7 and 8 seemed to be deletions in the same Y q armregion. Further two patients (Nos 3 and 5) seemed to have amplificationsin this same Y q arm region as well as in the Y p arm. We hypothesise thatchanges in the Y chromosome may be a risk factor for male breast cancer. Result of CGH analysis of the X and Y chromosome arms in males withbreast cancer ,2001
418,Breast cancer is one of the carcinomas that the extensive chromosomeaberrations involve in tumor development. Analysis of chromosome abnor malities in solid tumors by the CGH has gained much importance since itis more sensitive than cytogenetics in respect to analysis of DNA gains andlosses. Purpose Screening of breast tumors for copy number changesand comparing them with pathologic grades for tumor progression. Materi als/Methods DNA samples from 11 ductal and 4 lobular carcinomas wereanalysed. The tumor and control DNAs were differentially labelled by thePCR labelling technique. Results Our preliminary results revealed a sub stantial degree of overlap with the previous published reports. However 2of 11 ductal carcinomas showed 5q13.3 q21 amplification and 2 of 4 lobu lar ones revealed 5p gains and 16q21 q23 deletion. Of 15 analysed sam ples 8 (53%) showed various copy number changes. The correlationbetween the genetic changes and pathologic grades were discussed. Con clusion Gains and losses found by CGH are especially valuable becauseof determination of mechanisms and the effective genes involved in breasttumor development and progression. ,2001
419, strasbg.frBy CGH analysis of 21 low grade node and metastasis negative HNSCC we showed a simple and specific pattern of aberrations for pT1 2 but notpT3 tumors with frequent gains on the long arm of chromosome 3 (foundin 67% of cases) involving systematically the 3q26 qter area but with twoalternative smallest region overlaps at 3q26 and 3q28 qter. First to evalu ate the relative contribution of two outstanding positional and functionalcandidate oncogenes PIK3CA at 3q26 and p63 at 3q28 in the pathogen esis of HNSCC displaying a 3q gain we measured their respective tran scription levels in tumors with previously determined gene copy number. DNp63 the predominant p63 transcript is overexpressed in tumors com pared to normal tissues but its expression level is independent to genecopy number. In contrast a significant PIK3CA overexpression is associ ated with increased gene dosage. These results indicate that PIK3CA contrary to DNp63 may participate to the progression of head and necktumors consequently to a low level 3q over representation Second weselected by CGH and FISH on interphase nuclei tumors exhibiting local ized gains or amplifications in the 3q26 qter region. Analysis of thesetumors by high resolution CGH on a BAC array dedicated to chromosome3 will refine the mapping of 3q gains in head and neck cancer. ,2001
420,Blandder transitional cell carcinomas are heterogenous groups of tumorsin biological and behavior terms. Most of them are diagnosed at the firstpresentation as low grade and superficial but about two thirds of patientspresent recurrences of which 10 25% will be of a higher stage. Karyotyp ing of tumors have been demonstrated to be an important prognostic indexof cancers. However accurate karyotype analysis of solid tumors is fre quently insuficient by few number of recognizable metaphases. The detec tion of numerical chromosomal aberrations on interphase nuclei by fluo resence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been evidence to be important toolfor bladder cancer. In this study we performed FISH analysis with chro mosome specific probes to detect numerical chromosome 8 and 11 aber ations on washing and bioptic samples of bladder transitional cell carcino ma. The result showed that chromosomes 8 and 11 aneuploidies wereincreased. The incidence of aneuploidy increased in the paralel of thetumour stage. ,2001
421,Cervix cancer is a very frequent cancer among women especially in devel oping countries while reduction in its incidence in the developed world hasbeen reported through various mass screening approaches because of thepossibility of treatment on its early detection. Urine samples of just diag nosed cervix cancer patients (n=25 age range 21 75 yr) and of those withother gynaecological problems (n=25 age range 21 70 yr) wereprocessed for the MN test . The patients had married at an early age (11 15 yr) and had more number of abortions (n=21 19 spontaneous and 2induced) as compared to those in the controls (n=16 5 spontaneous 11induced). The total number of pregnancies were 127 and 93 in the patientsand control groups respectively. The cancer patients had mostly (n=19)low socioeconomic status while there were more control individuals (n=14)belonging to middle socioeconomic status. An elevated frequency of cellswith micronuclei was observed in 72% of the cancer patients which withthe Student s t test was significantly high (0.359Ã¢\x80\x930.058) as compared tothat in control ones(16.7% 0.058Ã¢\x80\x930.066). There were 8 individuals each instages I and II and 9 in stage III with the highest frequency of MNd cellsbeing observed in stage III cancer patients though statistical significantresults were also observed when damage in stages I and II were comparedwith the control data. Highest frequency of cells with micronuclei wasobserved in patients married in the age range of 11 15 years though thePosters: Cancer Cytogenetics 139 Patient NoChromosome X (+ amplif del)Chromosome Y (+ amplif del) 1 2 p q 3 p+ q+ 4 5 p+ q+ 6 7 XX p+ q 8 p+ q+ q damage in the other age at marriage groups was also significant. Maxi mum damage was also observed in 51 60 yrs age group though data inthe different age groups when compared to their parallel and total agegroups was significantly elevated too. The incidence of MNd cells washighest in the group with 4 6 number of pregnancies in the cancer patientsbut was also significant as compared to that in the parallel control groups. Significant results were also obtained on comparing the frequency of MNdcells in both the low and middle SES groups with their parallel controls. The results of the present study for the MNT in urothelial cells haverevealed an elevated frequency of cytogenetic damage in cervix cancerpatients even in a tissue which is not the site where the cancer has devel oped. ,2001
422,A 30 year old man with azoospermia was routinely investigated in theDepartment of Clinical Genetics in our hospital. His karyotype wasanalysed after PHA stimulation of lymphocytes following short term culti vation of peripheral blood. Taking his history it was ascertained that inchildhood. Hodkgkin s disease had been confirmed histologically. Hebegan treatm ent at 7 years receiving several series of combined cytosta tic treatnents supplemented with X ray therapy. The patient s history issummarised in table l./on the poster/. For the last l4 years the patient hasfelt very well. He is not taking medication and he has no problems with theprimary disease. He is examined by an oncologist twice a year/includingscintigraphy/with negative findings. He has no complications except forazoospermia. The karyotype was analysed using standard methods andchromosomes were stained by Giemsa following G banding by the trypsinmethod. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in about 20% of theanalysed mitoses and inclited neuploidy monosomy and polysomy of theautosomes balanced and unbalanced translocations newly derived mark er chromosomes breaks dicentric chromosomes acentric fragments andother changes. Pictures of them are demonstrated on the poster.

423, ulm.deTransgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) in exocrine pancreas show a transdifferentiation of acinar cells toduct like cells. These cells form tubular structures express ductal markersand develop pancreatic cancer with long latency and low incidence. Asexpected the Ras/Erk pathway is activated in premalignant lesions inTGFalpha transgenic mice. To investigate the effect of p53 inactivation ontumor susceptibility TGFalpha transgenic mice were cross bred with hete rocygous p53 knock out mice to generate TGFalpha/p53+/ and TGFal pha/p53 / mice. By p53 inactivation tumor formation is accelerated. TGFalpha/p53+/+ mice develop pancreatic tumors on average by day 360 TGFalpha/p53+/ by day 265 and TGFalpha/p53 / by day 100 (TGFal pha/p53+/+ n=32 TGFalpha/p53+/ n=41 TGFalpha/p53 / n=11). To iden tify recurrent secondary chromosomal imbalances pancreatic carcinomaswere analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and by LOHusing different markers. Tumors in TGFalpha/p53+/ mice segregate thewildtype p53 allel and acquire homozygous deletion of the p16INK4a /p19INK4a/ARF locus. CGH screening of these tumors revealed severalgains and losses. The most common overrepresentations were observedon chromosome 11 proximal and on chromosome 15 distal and underrep resentations on chromosome 11 distal and on chromosome 14. In contrastto human pancreatic adenocarcinoma the total number of aberrations inthe mouse tumors is low. But distinct genomic loci become affected. The increased copy number of some candidate genes on chromosome 11 and15 was measured by quantitaive realtime PCR. We found a variabledegree of amplification on chromosome 11 for Egfr c Rel and Stk10 andon chromosome 15 for c myc. Further cell lines were established from dif ferent tumors. ,2001
424,It has been reported that upon reaching a certain level of cell damage theproduction of repair enzymes is triggered which decrease the chromosomeaberrations (Pohl Ruling 1990 1991). If so prolonged exposure to highlevels of natural radiation in areas with elevated levels of background radi ation could decrease the frequency of chromosome aberrations. There arereports indicating that increased levels of chromosome aberrations in lym phocytes can be used to predict cancer risk in humans (Hagmar2000 1998). One may conclude that a dose of ionizing radiation sufficientto produce a certain level of cell damage increases production of antioxi dants and repair enzymes that decrease either the frequency of chromo some aberrations or the cancer risk. People in some areas of Ramsar acity in northern Iran receive an annual radiation dose from backgroundradiation that is more than five times higher than the 20 mSv yr 1 that ispermitted for radiation workers. Inhabitants of Ramsar have lived for manygenerations in these high background areas. If an annual radiation dose ofa few hundred mSv is detrimental to health causing genetic abnormalitiesor an increased risk of cancer it should be evident in these people. Ourcytogenetic studies show no significant differences between people in thehigh background compared to people in normal background areas. Asthere was no increased levels of chromosome aberrations it may be pre dicted that the cancer incidence is not higher than the neighboring areaswith normal background radiation level. Although there is not yet solid epi demiological information most local physicians in Ramsar report anecdo tally there is no increase in the incidence rates of cancer or leukemia intheir area. There are no data to indicate a significant increase of cancerincidence in other high background radiation areas (HBRAs). Furthermore several studies show a significant decrease of cancer death rates in areaswith high backgrounds. To test for adaptive response an in vitro challengedose of 1.5 Gy of gamma rays was administered to the lymphocytes. Lym phocytes of Ramsar residents showed significantly reduced radiation sen sitivity for chromosome aberrations compared to those of residents in nor mal background areas. Specifically following this exposure inhabitants ofHBRAs had about 56% the average number of induced chromosomalabnormalities of those in normal background radiation area (NBRA). Thesefindings suggest that adaptive response can be induced by chronic expo sure to radiation at levels lower than have been used in the laboratory. Given the apparent lack of ill effects in the populations of these high doserate areas these data further suggest that current dose limits are overlyconservative. It can be concluded that prolonged exposure to high levelsof natural radiation possibly triggers processes such as the production ofantioxidants and repair enzymes which decreases the frequency of chro mosome aberrations and the cancer incidence rate. ,2001
425,Malignant urothelial neoplasms occupy the second place on frequency andon lethality among neoplasias of a bludder. The favourable location of thelatter allows to utillize in treatment a local chemotherapy and immunother apy however not always it is possible to reach desirable outcome. Thus basing on histological research it is impossible to predict behaviour of atumour whether this tumor will be invasive whether this invasive tumourwill metastasize. A reason is hidden in heterogeneity of a tumour. The lastresearches in the field of molecular genetics have allowed closely to beapproximated to solution of these problems. As is known the neoplasia isaccompanied by genom changes of malignant cells. Researches indicat ing link of a biological potential of tumours with particular violations DNAalready have appeared. So series of the authors bind development of acancer of the bludder to deletions in particular districts of chromosomes 9p 13q and 17p. Thus mapping here genes supressors such as p16140 Posters: Cancer Cytogenetics(encodes inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinase) Rb (gene of a susceptibil ity to a retinoblastoma) p53 so called Lthe genom watchdogÃÂ± areexposed to mutations. These genes participate in a regulation of cell cycle not admitting a cell with DNA damages to division. It was detected that thep16 deletion is a marker for a squamous metaplasia with greatest pro gressiveness. The mutations of p53 gene are correlated with a degree stage and presence of a vascular invasion. The violations in Rb gene areauthentically influence on a survival rate of the patients. And though the proteins products of pathological genes are well detectedby immunohistochemistry methods it does not allow to reveal hetero geneity of a neoplasia. We have concentrated the researches on attemptto prove genetic heterogeneity of non papillary cancer (primary carcino mas in situ) and secondary centers of carcinoma in situ at preexisting pap illary tumour as it is known that the prognosis of current non papillary can cer is much worse and it practically is not diagnosticated at cytoskopy. Knowledges about heterogeneity of these groups of urothelial tumours willgive possibilities of development various protocols of treatment for them. ,2001
426,Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic malignancythat progresses from a benign chronic phase to an ill defined acceleratedphase and subsequently blast crisis. Among the various drugs adminis tered to CML patients Interferon alpha(IFN) is gaining importance due toits ability to induce cytogenetic response unlike the other myelo suppres sive drugs like Busulphan (BU) Myleran Hydroxyurea (HU) etc. The pres ent study was conducted in our laboratory to assess the response to IFNtherapy in the Philadelphia (PhÃÂ«) positive CML patients by sequential cyto genetic analysis and to evaluate the importance of employing FISH as anadjunct procedure in evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD). Cyto genetic analysis using standard protocols was carried out in 210 patients(including 12 in blast crisis). Out of these 185 patients (167 Ph+ and 18Ph ) were studied following presentations with clinical features of CMLwhile 25 cases (MPDs acute leukemias and leukemoid reaction) wereanalysed to exclude the possibility of having Ph translocation t(9 22)(q34 q11). Further dual colour FISH using specific probes for bcrand abl genes was done in 28 patients and the results were compared withthose of conventional cytogenetics. Standard Ph translocation wasobserved in 167 cases (89 were 100% Ph+ and the rest were mosaicsranging from 50 90%). One of the mosaic cases revealed the presence ofdouble Ph translocation in 23% of metaphases. Thirty six Ph+ patients onInterferon (IFN) therapy were followed up at intervals of 4 months till 3years. Sequential cytogenetic analysis and FISH was done in these casesat every follow up. Twelve patients showed cytogenetic response after 12months 7 after 16 months 3 after 20 months 1 after 24 months and 1 after32 months of IFN therapy. In all varied degrees of cytogenetic responsewas observed complete response (0% Ph+ cells) in 2 cases partialresponse (1% to 35% Ph +cells) in 1 case minor response (35% to 90%Ph+ cells) in 21 patients and no response (Ph+ cells >90%) in 14 cases. These results show that IFN therapy can suppress the Ph+ clone andreverse the bone marrow karyotype to normal in a significant number ofpatients. On comparing the results of cases analysed by FISH in 25 casesthe results were same as those obtained by cytogenetics. However 3cases which were Ph negative on karyotyping showed positive bcr/ablfusion signals on metaphase spreads and interphase nuclei. The resultsindicates that FISH is a highly sensitive and efficient tool for detecting evenlow levels of abnormal cells that appear Ph negative by cytogenetics. Thestudy shows the importance of using FISH for detecting response at themolecular level in CML patients on therapy and demonstrates the efficien cy of FISH in detecting abnormal clone of small size. ,2001
427,In the recent years the basic role of the routine chromosomal examinationin the clinical evaluation of mental retardation/multiple congenital anom alies (MR/MCA) syndromes has progressively been completed by FISH. However even the time and labour consuming FISH techniques includingYAC/BAC clones may be insufficient to give precise answer to the clinicalgeneticists. Cases are presented in which microsatellite marker analysesusing dried blood spots on Guthrie cards resulted in significant additionalinformation and completed the clinical diagnostics. In the first (patient withan unusual phenotype and a ring chromosome 15) the karyotype/pheno type correlation analysis was supplemented by precise data in the second(a complex chromosomal rearrangement) the lost of significant parts ofchromosomal material could be excluded with more certainty in the third(an interstitial deletion of the X chromosome) the extent of the missing partcould be defined more precisely. On the base of these observations theauthors suggest that it is worth enrolling microsatellite analysis to the rou tine protocoll of MR/MCA diagnostics which may result in significant dataessential not only for uniparental disomy but also for otherwise unsolubleclinical problems. ,2001
428,Multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization (M FISH) analysis allows thevisualization of 22 human autosomes and two sex chromosomes in 24 dif ferent colors. We have used M FISH analysis in four patients with compli cated chromosomal aberrations determined preliminary by GTG bindingmethods one case with 46 XY t(8 16 11) one case with 45 X 14 +t(1 14) one case with 46 XY +12p and one case with 46 XX. der(5) t(5 7)(p15.1 p15.3). Furthermore region specific DNA probes were used toverify precise break points in abnormal chromosomes. Then karyotypeswereidentified as follows one was 46 XY t(8 16 11)(q21.2 p11.2 p11.2) one was 45 X 14 der(Y) t(Y 1)(q11.2 q25) t(Y 14)(p11.3 q13) ins(Y 3)(p11.3 q24 q25) one was 47 XY +dup(12) (pter q13.11) and one was 46 XX der(5) t(5 7)(p15.1 p15.3)mat. In all cases deleted and duplicatedportions were discertained by GTG binding methods. The M FIHS analysiswas able to identify easily chromosomal origins in marker chromosomes. The M FISH analysis in addition to the GTG binding method is providedwith the most cytogenetic information in complicated chromosomal aberra tions. ,2001
429,The recently described M FISH and SKY techniques are complementary tothe standard karyotypic analysis identifying the origin of rearranged chro mosomal fragments. However only the poor DAPI banding is usually usedto define the breakpoints. Here we report the analysis of 18 patients pre senting different constitutional chromosomal abnormalities with a new M FISH technique IPM FISH which combines IRS PCR painting probes andM FISH resulting in a simultaneous labeling and R banding. Method Patients presented constitutional abnormalities including numerical andstructural chromosomal rearrangements. These patients have been previ ously karyotyped by RHG banding. Ten to thirty metaphases were ana lyzed by IPM FISH. Painting probes were labeled with combinations ofFITC DEAC Cy3 Texas Red Cy5. Images were acquired and analyzedas already described (Aurich Costa et al. Genes Chromosomes and Can cer in press). Results All chromosomal abnormalities were detected andcompletely described using IPM FISH in a single experiment. There is aperfect correlation in the breakpoint definition between IPM FISH and RHGbanding. Only when the chromosomal abnormalities involved heterochro matic or repeat regions is IPM FISH unable to determine the chromosomalorigin. However in those cases whatever the technique used in the kary otypic analysis other FISH techniques are required to determine the ori gin. Conclusion Here we show that even for intrachromosomal rearrange ments IPM FISH is a sensitive precise and reliable technique. ,2001
430,The CXC or small inducible cytokine B subfamily (SCYB) includes the nonERL CXC T cell chemoattractants MIG (SCYB9) and IP 10 (SCYB10).These gamma interferon inducible chemokines were localized to humanchromosome 4q21 and have been shown to be organized in a mini clusterthat is distant from another tight cluster of other CXC chemokine genes at4q12. The physical separation together with data from phylogenetic analy sis of the CXC proteins suggest that MIG and IP 10 form a distinct evolu tionary lineage. We recently identified the human and mouse homologueof the closely related chemokine I TAC (SCYB11) and mapped this geneto the same mini cluster at 4q21 and the orthologous mouse locus 5E3 respectively by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Here using iso lated PAC and BAC probes and cloned sequences from SCYB9 SCYB10 and SCYB11 from man and mouse we applied two colour FISH onstretched DNA fiber preparations (Fiber FISH). On both human andmouse DNA fiber targets the three chemokines were found in an identicalarrangement as a cluster within a range of approximately 25 kilobases. Wehave determined the arrangement from centromer to telomere(SCYB11/SCYB10/SCYB9) and the distance separating the genes (5 kband 7 kb respectively). Sequence and FISH data strongly support thehypothesis that the three genes result from gene duplication which tookplace before emergence of muroid rodents. ,2001
431, bielefeld.de To date almost complete sequences of two human chromosomes areavailable and allow to search for chromosomal regions of interest if suit able computing programs are at hand. We have used the REPuter pro gram to view the distribution of exact and degenerate repeats with a mini mal length of 20 bp in the Down syndrome critical region and subtelomer ic region of 21q22.3. The program allowed us to select for large regionswithout repeats and high gene content. Moreover we have designed spe cific primers within these sequences and isolated several overlapping BACclones by screening a BAC library. By sequencing the ends of these BACclones the exact size and positions of the clones in the map of chromo some 21 were determined. These BAC clones are generich and are com posed of fewer repeats compared to other sequences known on chromo some 21 thus they are suitable for Fluorescence in situ hybridisation(FISH) analyses. These clones yield high intensity region specific FISHsignals on both metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei and rep resent a major source for the identification of trisomy and subtelomericdeletions for chromosome 21. Here we present a combined software andexperimental approach and show the application to extract specificsequences that are useful for the detection of human chromosomal disor ders. ,2001
432,The human genome is a mosaic of isochores long segments of DNA withdistinctive characteristics of gene richness and nucleotid composition(Bernardi et al.). The correlation between isochores and chromosomalbands has been extensively studied but the relation with viability of thesesegments in triple doses was poorly explored. Brewer et al have describeda map of partial trisomies and their correlation with different phenotypes. Over the last 25 years partial autosomal trisomies have been importanttools for gene mapping with the aim of locate genes in contiguous genesyndromes contributing towards the mapping of several loci. A systemati cal analysis of chromosomal segments not observed in partial trisomiescan provide information about triple dose lethal genes and on the otherhand those segments observed in tetradoses those vertically transmitedin triple doses and those appeared in triple doses with normal phenotypes can yield clues on the biological role of chromosomal organisation. We pro pose here a map of chromosomal duplications based on clinical informa tion from reports appeared in Medline about autosomal partial trisomies and analyse its correlations with different types of chromosomal bands. ,2001
433,Results from transfection and transgenesis experiments are usuallyassessed by PCR with primers for the sequence of the cDNA or thegenomic fragment under study. Sequences to be introduced either containa selectable marker themselves or are being co transfected with a plas mid carrying such a marker. We have used FISH analysis (i) to quicklyassess the proportion of cells into which a cosmid had been co transfect ed with a neomycin resistant plasmid and to check the clones resultingafter appropriate dilution to obtain monoclonal cultures for cosmid content (ii) to determine integration sites for PACs with a selectable marker and toselect those clones that had single copy or low copy integration (iii) to determine integration sites of human gene constructs in human gene expressing transgenic mice and rats. In all these applications FISH analy sis appeared to be an easy and excellent method of assessment of results. Where the latter occurs on the basis of many cells in culture or tissue thusobliterating differences between individual cells FISH analysis leads to avery precise picture on a cell by cell basis. Therefore we consider FISHanalysis a welcome if not necessary complement to assessment by PCR. ,2001
434, bonn.deA 5 year old boy presented with ASD II bilateral cleft palate strabism bilat eral optic nerve coloboma sensorineural hearing loss bilateral inguinalherniae micropenis seizures and a pronounced psychomotor develop mental retardation. Height weight and head circumference were wellbelow the 3rd centile. The family history was inconspicuous. Cytogeneticanalyses demonstrated a derivative chromosome 5 with additional materi al of unknown origin in the distal long arm. FISH with a whole chromosomepaint / WCP 5 indicated a heterologous insertion of material within 5q3. Itsbanding pattern was inconclusive and did not allow identification of theinserted material. COBRA multi colour FISH with 24 WCPs pointed out achromosome 3 origin of the inserted material which was confirmed by FISHwith a WCP 3. Even with this information the breakpoints of the aberrationcould not be determined upon re examination of GTG CBG and QFQ banded metaphases Although a pericentromeric origin of the insertedmaterial could be excluded after CBG banding its banding pattern fit nei ther the short nor the long arm of chromosome 3 exactly. To clarify the ori gin of the insertion studies by 48 colour COBRA FISH are in progress. Using only 5 fluorophores this novel technique achieves colour identifica tion of 48 different targets in our case the differential labeling of all humanp and q arms by PQ COBRA FISH (Genome Res. 10 861 865). Results ofthe additional studies as well as a genotype phenotype correlation will bepresented. Supported by the DFG / Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ,2001
435,From January 1 1995 to December 15 2000 we have performed 1375molecular cytogenetic studies in 167 amniotic fluids 5 CVS 63 bone mar rows 115 tissues and 996 cultures of peripheral blood. Microdeletion syn dromes rearrangements and marker chromosomes have been detected orcharacterized by these techniques. We used wcp alpha satellite and spe cific region probes for FISH. MFISH was performed with the MulticolorSpectra Vysion Assay from Vysis and the Applied Imaging CytoVision Soft ware. The subtelomeres were investigated with either the ChromoprobeMultiprobe T from Cytocell or the ToTelVysion Vysis probes. Examples ofchromosome markers identified by these techniques include two smallmarkers derived from chromosome 5 a small marker 7 in a case that alsohad a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome and a marker 13q32 qterwith neocentromere. Several cases with de novo translocations were rec ognized by these techniques. In two of these cases the translocated regionwas very small and included the subtelomeres. In these cases we used themultiple subtelomeric probes. We found that an add (18)(p11.2) was ader(18)t(18 14) with monosomy 18p and partial trisomy 14q and the othercase had a der(8)t(8 13) with monosomy 8p and partial trisomy 13q. MFISH studies in bone marrows and solid tumors characterized the originof multiple chromosome rearrangements and helped in the interpretation ofthe diagnoses and/or prognoses. We conclude that the availability of newprobes and the use of specialized techniques such as MFISH and sub telomereric probes have improved significantly the services offered by clin ical cytogenetic laboratories. ,2001
436,A 13 years old girl with typical clinical features of Turner phenotype (shortstature shield chest short neck) subjected to cytogenetic analysis. Cul tured lymphocytes studies identified the small supernumerary marker chro mosome in 49% of cells. The both parents had normal karyotype. Multiplestaining techniques were used for identification of the extra chromosome. With QFH banding the marker appeared as monocentric with two majorQFH positive bands and with satellites of variable size on its both ends with C banding two C positive regions indicated that chromosome pos sessed two centromeres. Silver staining demonstrated the presence ofNORs variety in size on both ends. NOR activity was estimated by the sizeof silver deposits using Arbitrary Scale Units of 0 3. The NOR activity ofeach acrocentric chromosome in patient karyotype was the same as inparental karyotypes except both chromosomes 14 and maternal chromo some 22. Comparisons of the total cellular NOR activity of cells with mark er and without it showed significant difference (P<0 05). This differencewas conditioned by marker chromosome NOR activity. NOR activity ofacrocentric chromosomes 13 14 15 21 22 was the same in both celllines. The existence of compensatory mechanisms regulating Ag NORactivity seemed to be rather improbable in that case. ,2001
437, giessen.deThe diagnosis of human malformation syndromes if not possible at aglance requires much subsequent work. In the case of an unrecognisedpattern of multiple congenital anomalies a chromosome karyotype is usu ally requested. Developmental delay growth retardation and abnormalitiesof three different organ systems strongly suggest a chromosomal aberra tion. Some commercially available computerised data bases like SYN DROC and the Human Cytogenetics Database provide information on thephenotypes of patients with cytogenetically ascertained chromosome aber rations. The diagnostic abilities of these programs were tested using theclinical findings of 101 patients with an established karyotype. Both pro grams are based on an algorithm which seeks and defines a diagnosis bya set of phenotypic components all having the same weight (descriptivealgorithm). A second (Bayesian) algorithm is applied by SYNDROC to rankcompeting diagnoses in order of probability. We used three levels of preci sion to evaluate the proposed diagnoses suggestion of the correct (1)chromosome (2) chromosome arm (3) aberration typ. The best resultswere yielded with the descriptive algorithm the respective chromosomewas diagnosed in nearly all cases the correct chromosomal arm in about60% of all tests and the aberration typ on the right chromosome arm wassuggested in about 25%. With the Bayesian algorithm the respective num bers were 52% 28% and 16%. The probabilities calculated with this algo rithm were far from being convincing with values of less than 0.25 for themajority of cases. Since all patients had a cytogenetically confirmed diag nosis it seems to be necessary to change some of the estimates that wentinto the Bayesian formula. ,2001
438,We studied segregation of Robertsonian translocation (RT) 14/21 in largefamily. Besides carriers of RT 14/21 we found exchange in chromosomalcomposition from RT 14/21 to 21/21 in one sibling. He has one child withtrisomy 21 and there was one spontaneous abortion. In the rest of familywe found another 2 cases of trisomy 21 and 5 spontaneous abortions. Weexamined another 7 families with various RTs in our database. Alltogether in 8 genealogies there were 40 carriers 4 cases of trisomy of acrocentricsand 18 spontaneous abortions. We did not find the same case of exchangeof acrocentrics in RTs in our database. The literature does also not refer tosuch identical unusual segregation in RTs. Chromosomes 13 14 and 21144 Posters: Cytogeneticsare preferentially engaged in RTs therefore carriers of 13/14 14/21 and 21/21 are most frequently found in the population of newborns as well asin groups of patients with various types of ascertainment. Preference ofchromosomes 13 14 and 21 in RTs explains Therman /1989/ in hypothe sis about crossing over in segment A B dealing with inversion of A B inchromosome 14 relative to chromosomes 13 and 21. We assume thatoccurence of exchange of chromosomes in RT from 14/21 to 21/21 isextremely seldom and may proceed via two mechanisms a/ meioticcrossing over with exchange in RT from 14/21 to 21/21 and subsequentloss of chromosome 21 after fertilisation in early trisomic zygota b/ mitoticcrossing over in early zygota releasing the chromosome 14 from RT 14/21and formation of RT 21/21. Risk of unbalanced offspring for male carrierRT 14/21 is about 2.5% while risk for carrier RT 21/21 is 100%. ,2001
439,Mr. & Mrs. A. F. an unrelated couple were referred to our center for chro mosomal study with history of three abortions. Mr. A. F. is 32 years old andMrs. A. F. a 27 years old female with G3 P0 Ab3. Twenty metaphsespreads of Mr. A. F. revealed normal male karyotype. 50 metaphasespreads were studied from PHA stimulated lymphocytes of Mrs. A. F. show ing four mosaic patterns with robertsonian translocation of chromosomes13. 45 XX der(13 13)9q10 q10)/ 45 cells (90%) showed 45 chromosomeswith one copy of the derivative chromosome 3 cells (6%) showed 46 chro mosomes with 2 copies of the derivative chromosome without normal 13s(tetrasomy 13) 1 cell (2%) showed one derivative chromosome and onenormal 13 (trisomy 13) 1 cell (2%) had one normal chromosome 13(monosomy 13). Unfortunately further medical work up and examinationwas not possible because of lack of cooperation on the patient s part. Webelieve that the various mosaic cell lines are a result of pre and post zygot ic nondisjunction???? ,2001
440," or ', 'Down Syndrome (DS) is usually the result of maternal meiotic non dis junction. DS with free trisomy 21 in more than two siblings of chromoso mally normal parents is due to gonadal mosaicism or premature cen tromere division (PCD). Here we report on a consanguineous arab familywith 10 children of whom three had free trisomy 21. The parental kary otypes were normal and did not exhibit PCDs. Based on 22 evenly distrib uted microsatellites it was shown that the extra chromosome was ofmaternal origin resulting from an error in meiosis I (2 cases) and meiosisII. The recombination rate (1 and 2 exchanges in the siblings) was normal. In addition we have analysed the rate of somatic malsegregation in inter phase nuclei of cytochalasin B blocked binucleated lymphocytes and lym phoblastoid cells (LCLs) in both parents their trisomic offspring the grand mother and greatgrandmother and three unrelated controls. Fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed using pericentricprobes for chromosome 21 and 22 to score 1000 binucleated cells per indi vidual. The frequency of non disjunction of chromosome 21 but not of 22 was significantly increased in the lymphocytes and LCLs of the mothercompared to the other family members and controls as well. To the best ofour knowledge this is the first report that a high rate of maternal meioticnon disjunction is paralleled by a specific increase in mitotic non disjunc tion. Further studies are in progress to elucidate the genetic basis of thisnew phenomenon. ",2001
441,Using multi colour fluorescence in situ hybridization we compared the fre quencies of disomy and diploidy of chromosomes 1 16 18 X and Ybetween spermatozoa of good motility with those of poor motility after sep aration by swim up glass wool and two layer discontinuous Percoll meth ods. Semen samples were collected from 7 normal males aged 26 31 years. A minimum of 6 000 sperm nuclei per sample for disomy and 12 000sperm nuclei per sample for diploidy were evaluated for each chromosome(618 335 sperm nuclei total). Hybridization efficiency was 99.61%. We didnot observe significant differences in disomy rates for any chromosomewhen comparing spermatozoa with good motility to those with poor motili ty. Diploidy rates in the discontinuous Percoll separated spermatozoa werenot significantly different between spermatozoa with good motility andthose with poor motility (p=0.31). However after separation by glass woolmethod the frequency of diploid sperm with good motility (mean=0.26% range=0.16% 0.37%) was significantly higher than those with poor motility(mean=0.22% range=0.12% 0.35%) (p=0.046). After separation by swim up method the frequency of diploid spermatozoa with good motility(mean=0.18% range 0.12% 0.30%) was significantly lower than thosewith poor motility (mean=0.25% range 0.17% 0.43%) (p=0.010). Eventhough significant differences were observed between motile and poorlymotile spermatozoa selected by swim up and Glass wool methods the dif ferences were so small that they could be ignored in clinical practice. Ourresults suggest that the separation of motile sperm by the methodsdescribed here does not have an effect on the selection of spermatozoa ofdisomy and diploidy. ,2001
442,The case 9 years of age the daughter of healthy parents (mother 43 yearsfather 44 years) was referred to our center because of the mental retarda tion. The pedigree was normal the two sibs of the proband were healthy. Her pysical examination revealed facial dysmorphism microchephaly hiperflexibility of the joints. The chromosome constitution of her was deter mined as 46 XX/47 XX +22 (98/2) (2%). Because of the mosaic karyotype skin biopsy was performed and then the FISH results were analysed. Themosaic trisomy was confirmed (46 XX/47 XX +22) (73/27) (27%). Thephysical features of the case were in consistent with her mosaic karyotype. This case was reported since mosaic trisomy 22 is the rarely seen abnor mality and it is a good example to show the importance of FISH in mosaickaryotypes. ,2001
443,Mental retardation affects 2 3% of the population and is etiologically veryheterogeneous. It has involved at least in 503 gene disorders and in mostchromosomal anomalies. Routine cytogenetic analysis indicates that chro mosomal anomalies are the cause at about 35% of cases of severe men tal retardation. Multiprobe FISH reveals submicroscopic subtelomericchromosome defects in 7% of unexplained cases of moderate and severemental retardation. We have performed cytogenetic analysis in 243patients with severe mental retardation. Using standard cytogenetic tech niques (Giemsa C R Q banding) 54 (22.2%) cases of chromosomalanomalies were identified 38 cases (15.6%) of aneuploidies and 16 cases(6.6%) of structural rearrangements. We have performed a pilot study ofMultiprobe FISH (Cytocell Chromoprobe Multiprobe T System) in 8patients with unexplained severe mental retardation and malformations/dysmorphisms and normal conventional 400 550 bands karyotype. Fromthem in one case a subtelomeric rearrangement was identified deletionXq. The girl (21 year old) has etiologically unclear severe mental retarda tion short stature (140cm 2.3SD) slight microcephaly (48cm 2.3SD) dysmorphic features as epicanthic folds short fingers V clinodactyly etc. These features coincide with previously published certain clinical diagnos tic criteria that improve the detection rate of subtelomeric rearrangements. Results suggest that banding analysis combined with M FISH increase thepossibility to detect causes of mental retardation. ,2001
444,Korean Cytogenetic Database Study Group was organized in 1997 toestablish Korean cytogenetic database. The Korean Cytogenetic DatabaseStudy Group consists of 23 contributing Cytogenetic Laboratories through Posters: Cytogenetics 145out South Korea. The Korean Cytognetic Database is critical 1) to study the epidemiololgy ofcytogenetic abnormalities among Koreans 2) to design clinical cytogenet ic services 3) to understand unique cytogenetic findings among Koreans 4) to determine urgent cytogenetic research questions. Between 1997 and1999 7147 cases of abnormal karyotypes were registered. The classifica tion based on tissue samples are follows 4495 cases of peripheral blood 235 of peripheral blood oncology 1060 of amniotic fluid 1098 of chorionicvilli 141 of fetal blood 394 of Product of conception 607 of bone marrowand 17 of other specimens. Among these the detailed analysis of 4401cases of peripheral blood and 979 of amniotic fluid will be presented. In numeric abnormalities trisomy 21 was the most common abnormalitesand followed by trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 among autosomes. Among sexchromosome XXY was the most common and followed by 45 X. In struc tural abnormalites reciprocal trnalocation and robertsonian translocationare two most common abnormalities. The t(13 14) t(14 21) and t(14 22)were the most common robertsonian translocation in descending ordersamong Koreans. In conclusion Korean cytogenetic database present the first comprehen sive epidemiologic data on cytogenetic abnormalities among Koreans. Ourdata are compatible with other datasets reported in other countries. ,2001
445,Three main mechanisms of aneuploidy formation are known meiotic biva lents nondisjunction equal number of hypo and hyperhaploid oocytes isresult of it anaphase lagging its outcome is hypohaploid oocytes and pre cocious division of centromeres of univalents at first meiotic division ane uploidy by single hromatids is result of this mechanism. But up to our daysreasons of aneuploidy formation by these mechanisms are still unknown. The aim of this work was to investigate the maternal age influence on thecontribution of each mechanism of aneuploidy formation in oocytesretrieval during IVF programs. Oocytes from 67 women (average age29.4Ã¢\x80\x933.2 years) undergoing IVF were the object of this study. Women weredivided into two groups group1 Ã¢\x80\x94 35 patients under 30 years old averageage Ã¢\x80\x94 26.4Ã¢\x80\x931.8 group2 Ã¢\x80\x94 32 patients from 30 years old average age33.5Ã¢\x80\x932.5. Such air drying methods as described by Tarkowski 1966 Mikamo and Kamiguchi 1983 Wramsby 1985 Almeida and Bolton 1993were used to prepare the oocytes for cytogenetic analysis. Our resultsshowed that 50% of oocytes were aneuploid. Increase of hypohaploidoocytes number in the first group (41.2Ã¢\x80\x934.9% versus 33.3Ã¢\x80\x934.7% in group2) was showed. The main mechanism of aneuploidy formation in the group1 was anaphase lagging (33.8%). In the group 2 two mechanisms of ane uploidy formation were predominate anaphase lagging and precociousdivision of centromeres of univalents at first meiotic division (both 14.3%).In such way increasing of female age can change contribution of differentmechanisms of aneuploidy formation. ,2001
446,Analysis of the spectrum of congenital disorders over the last ten yearsencountered in the Nehru Hospital a referral hospital catering to fourneighbouring states in north India is presented. Aneuploidy of the autoso mal chromosomes and the sex chromosomes are commonly encounteredproblems. The aneuploidies are a result of a non disjunction error in meio sis I or anaphase lag. Karyotyping of GTG banded metaphases fromperipheral blood lymphocytes for genetic disorders on 1400 samples wasperformed. We found 339 cases of Downs syndrome with trisomy 21.Translocations to chromosomes 21 13 and 14 were encountered in 6.99percent of cases and mosaicism was found in 2.43 percent. Sex chromo some aberrations like Turner s syndrome (TS) was found in 76 cases with29 percent patients having mosaicism. There were two cases with 45 XY/XO. In addition three cases of TS were mosaics for XXX or super female. There were 26 cases of Klinefelter s syndrome with four of themshowing mosaicism. Nineteen individuals were diagnosed to be malepseudohermaphrodites with female phenotypes and 9 cases were femalepseudohermaphrodites with male phenotypes. Of the 65 cases refered asambiguous genitalia where no sex could be ascribed phenotypically in 46cases male genotype and in 19 cases female genotype could be assigned. Mullerian agenesis confirmed on ultrasonography and a normal karyotypewas found in 40 cases. Two cases of Edward s syndrome (trisomy 18) and one case of Patau s syndrome (trisomy 13) was found. Sporadic cases ofvarious translocations and other abnormalities like 46 XY t(9 18) 46 XYt(3 4) 46 XY(18p ) 46 XY isochromosome 17 and five cases of markerchromosome were also encountered. This data gives an idea of the spectrum of cytogenetic disorders seen in Indians from our region. ,2001
447,Genetics findings in 100 infertile men referred to Uromia s Cytogeneticsand Molecular Medicine Unit Dr. M. D.Omrani* Dr. M. R.Fallah Mrs. F. AziziCytogenetics and Mol. Med. Unit Mottahary Hospital Uromia Iran Dept ofUrology Imam Hospital Uromia Iran Keywords infertility Azoospermia Klienfilter s syndrome From 100 men who presented at infertility clinics andwho had Azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia blood and semensamples were taken and cytogenetics and PCR studies were carried out. The chromosomal studies revealed the following results About 30% ofcases were classified as classic Klienfilter s syndrome 13.3% as MosaicKlienfilter s syndrome (46XY/46XXY) 10% Familial Hypospadiasis 6.6%Male with 46XX karyotype (SRY gene present azoospermia factor geneabsent) 3.3% Chromosomal deletion (Ypdel) 3.3% Hormonal problem(hyperprolactenemia) and 30% Idiopathic. In order to find out the causesof infertility in the idiopathic cases PCR reactions were carried out usingleukocyte DNA and sperm DNA. Y chromosomes deletions in leukocytesDNA but not in sperm DNA were detected. No Y chromosomes deletionswere detected in the fathers of these men. AZF deletions in these men(65% of idiopathic cases) are de novo mutations. The impact of these find ing in this small city which has habitants with different cultural and beliefbackgrounds were very important. In some part of this area still there is anold belief that all infertilities of a couple back to the female and man hasright for second marriage without paying any attention to his wife. There fore these results are a relief for women from the sense of guilt. It alsogives the opportunity to offer genetic testing and genetic counseling beforestarting assisted reproductive procedures. ,2001
448,Klinefelter Syndrome (KFS) is a numeric sex chromosomal aberrationcaused by meiotic nondisjunction. Approximately 15% KF patients aremosaics with variable phenotype. Available literature does not distinguishthe variant cases from KFS but since these cases have a distinct pheno type we analysed these cases in detail. Cytogenetic analysis was done in85 cases of male infertility. Of this 9 cases were diagnosed as KFS 6 weremosaic KF and 3 were variant cases. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization wasdone in variant cases to asses the percentage of different cell lines and thiswas compared with the cytogenetic results. In all variant cases detailedclinical examination was done. One Variant case with47 XXY(60%)/48 XXXYY(26%)/49 XXXYY(14%) was 5.8 feet tall withpoorly developed secondary sexual characters scant body hair gynaeco mastia bilateral soft testis high gonadotrophin levels and normal testos terone levels. He also had congenital heart disease (CHD) with MitralValve Prolapse and coarse facial features. Testicular Fine needle aspira tion cytology (FNAC) showed Sertoli Cell Only syndrome. The second vari ant with 46 XY(53%)/48 XXXY(40%)/49 XXXYY(7%) was 5.6 feet tall withpoorly developed secondary sexual characters euchnoid habitus and ele vated gonadotrophins and low Testosterone level. He had low IQ wasmentally retarded and had difficulty in speech which led to tempertantrums. He also had delayed milestones. FNAC showed few germ cellsin some semeniferous tubules but predominantly SCO type 11 syndromeThe third KF variant had 46 XY(50%)/47 XXY(30%)/48 XXYY(20%) chro mosome complement. MRI showed normal testis a nd gonadotrophin lev els were in the normal range. He was 5.8 feet tall and had low IQ. Themean FSH LH and Testosterone levels in these 3 KF variant was36.6mIu/ml 16.6mIu/ml and 1.8ng/ml respectively. The percentage ofmosaic cell lines identified cytogenetically was confirmed by FISH. Thesevariant cases had additional clinical features than KF patients and thusvariant cases should have a detailed clinical examination to look for CHD behavioral and speech problems and skeletal abnormalities. Those variantcases with normal cell line may show spermatogenesis in some semenif erous tubules on FNAC and thus these couples can be advised to go in for146 Posters: CytogeneticsAssisted Reproductive Technology (ART) after genetic counseling . FISH in adjunt to conventional cytogenetics helps in identifying in low levelmosaicism and enables us to calculate the accurate risk estimation incases going in for ART. ,2001
449,A total of 204 infertile men comprising of 186 married men referred forinfertility lasting between 3 and 14 years and 18 unmarried individualsaged between 11 and 28 years referred for congenital abnormalities ofexternal genitalia or absence of secondary sexual characters were inves tigated. Data on family history habits occupational hazards details of clin ical examination and laboratory findings including hormone levels ultra sound and X ray report semen analysis and infections and/or surgicaloperations were recorded using a questionnaire. Eighteen men were foundto possess chromosomal abnormalities upon analysis of GTG Ã¢\x80\x94 bandedmetaphases obtained from cultured lymphocytes from the married men(Azoospermia = 98 Oligozoospermia = 88). Seven showed 47 XXY kary otype 9 were Klinefelter mosaics one was a Klinefelter variant (48 XXYY)and one possessed an inherited translocation t (1 22). Meiotic studies andhistological evaluation were carried out in 38 cases employing testicularbiopsy. Desynapsis X Y dissociation a low number of chiasma univa lents stickiness spermatogenic arrest at various levels germ cell degen eration and aplasia (Sertoli cell only syndrome and mixed SCO) weresome of the abnormalities noted. Eleven unmarried men showed anabnormal karyotype Ã¢\x80\x94 4 had 47 XXY complement 6 were Klinefelter mosaics and one had an inherited translocation t(Y 15). These results sug gest that chromosomal aberrations play an important role in the causationof male infertility. A correlation was also observed between the abnormalkaryotype and the phenotypic characteristics. ,2001
450,The aim of our study was the evaluation of meiosis in 47 XXY or 46 XYgonia in azoospermic non mosaic Klinefelter patients by two ways inves tigation of the correlation between the sex chromosomes complements ofthe biopsied testicular cells and the efficiency of spermatogenesis evalu ation of the aneuploidy rate in post meiotic cells when found. Material andmethods Both karyotype and FISH analysis on lymphocytes of fiveazoospermic men were homogeneously 47 XXY. Testis biopsy was per formed for the 5 patients . In the IVF laboratory if any testicular spermato zoa were recovered all the biopsied tissue was frozen for a subsequentIntra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection attempt excepted one smear whichwas prepared for FISH analysis with three directly labelled probes for X Yand 18 chromosomes (ChromoprobeÃÂ¡Cytocell) Results A total of 280labelled testicular cells was observed. The only patient for whom no sper matozoa was recovered had only diploid 47 XXY testis cells (n=56). Thefour other patients displayed 46 XY and 47 XXYdiploid testis cells . Allpachytene figures were 46 XY (n=21). The post meiotic aneuploidy rate based on the observation of spermatids (n=66) and spermatozoa(n=26)was 6 5%.and involved mostly (4/6) Y meiosis II malsegregation and auto somal disomy. Our results support the hypothesis that only 46 XY goniacan achieve successfully meiosis in Klinefelter patients with a low aneu ploidy rate for sex chromosomes in resulting haploid cells. ,2001
451, freiburg.deComparative FISH mapping of human Y genes and gene families on chro mosomes of higher primates have shown that Y chromosomal rearrange ments are confined to the non recombining parts of the Y chromosomes ofhigher primates outside the pseudoautosomal and the sex determiningregion. In the course of our search for evolutionary breakpoints we per formed comparative FISH mapping of individual PAC clones from a human Y chromosomal PAC contig to chromosomes of humans great apes andOld World monkeys. The PAC contig spans approximately 2.8 Mb in prox imal Yq11.21 including the entire AZFa region. Interestingly our FISH results revealed that some DNA segments within the PAC clones are notexclusively restricted to their place of origin in Yq11.21 but are found atadditional Y chromosomal X chromosomal and as well as at autosomalsites within the human karyotype. Similar results were obtained for greatapes although certain human PAC clones were observed to generatealtered signal patterns on the Y chromosomes of great apes. These alteredpatterns indicate species specific rearrangements during primate evolutionand some of these are also of phylogenetic interest. ,2001
452,Infertility affects ~15 % of all couples. In about half of these cases the infer tility can be attributed to the male partner. One possible cause of maleinfertility is an increased proportion of aneuploid and polyploid spermato zoa. In our study sperm cells of eleven infertile patients aged 28 47 years and four healthy probands of proven fertility aged 33 36 years were inves tigated. Disomy rates of chromosomes 3 7 8 9 11 18 X and Y as wellas diploidy rates were analysed by single and triple colour fluorescence insitu hybridization. Semenograms of the patients showed oligoasthenotera to (OAT n=4) oligoastheno (OA n=2) terato (T n=3) asthenoterato (AT n=1) and oligoteratozoospermia (OT n=1). The mean disomy rate forall autosomes analysed was similar for infertility patients (0 11 %) and con trol subjects (0 09 %). In contrast significant differences between fertileand infertile males were observed for gonosome aneuploidies and diploidyrates. The average frequency of sex chromosome aneuploidy in infertilepatients was twice as high as in the controls. The frequency of XY sper matozoa caused by meiosis I failures was 0 05 % in fertile and 0 19% ininfertile males. In contrast XX and YY spermatozoa were demonstrated in0 11 % of both groups. Diploid spermatozoa were detected with a meanfrequency of 0 16 % in infertile males the controls showed a mean of 0 05%. A donor adapted protocol for spermhead decondensation ensuringmaximum probe penetration and hybridization efficiency will be presented. Furthermore we discuss the correlation of sperm aneuploidy / diploidy andmale infertility. ,2001
453,"Sex determination and development in humans is a very complex process. Many genetic or chromosomal disorders can alter the process and resultin sex reversal. For example XY females can result from an abnormalinterchange between the X and the Y chromosomes or from a mutation inthe SRY (Sex determining Region of the Y chromosome) or in the andro gen receptor genes. Some other aberrations such as mutations of SF1 SOX9 or WT1 deletions of 2q 9p or 10q and duplication of Xp21 havebeen reported. We present the case of a girl with dysmorphism anddelayed growth development associated with an abnormal male karyotype. FISH analysis with probes WCPY (Whole Chromosome Painting of the Y) WCPX (Whole Chromosome Painting of the X) DYZ3 (recognizing the Ycentromeric region) DYZ1 (recognizing Yq12) SRY (Yp11.3) DXS142(Xp21.1) and the co hybridization of TelVysion subtelomeric Xp/Yp andXq/Yq have shown a 46 X der(Y)t(X Y)(p11.3 q11.222~q11.23) karyotype. Probe SRY was positive. Thus the sex reversed patient has two copies ofall the genes within the Xp11.3 Xpter fragment including DSS (DosageSensitive Sex reversal). A review of the literature shows that the Xp dupli cation is associated with sex reversal when DSS is duplicated. This caseadds strength to the hypothesis that the double presence of active DSS inXY individuals even in the presence of active SRY might be sufficient tocause sex reversal.

454,We have demonstrated that infertile men who are candidates for intracyto plasmic sperm injection (ICSI) have an increased frequency of chromoso mal abnormalities in their sperm. Reports based on prenatal diagnosis ofICSI pregnancies have confirmed the increased frequency of chromoso mal abnormalities in offspring. Most studies to date have lumped varioustypes of infertility together. However it is quite likely that some subsets ofinfertility have an increased risk of sperm chromosomal abnormalitieswhereas others do not. We have studied 9 men with severe terato zoospermia (0 13% morphologically normal forms) by multicolour fluores cence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to determine if they have anincreased frequency of disomy for chromosomes 13 21 XX YY and XY as well as diploidy. Eight of the men also had asthenozoospermia (<20%forward progression) but none of the men had oligozoospermia (<20 X 106sperm/ml). The patients ranged in age from 20 to 49 years (mean 33.2years) in comparison to 18 normal control donors who were 23 58 years(mean 35.6 years). The control donors had normal semen parameters andno history of infertility. A total of 180 566 sperm were scored in the terato zoospermic men with a minimum of 10 000 sperm analyzed/donor/chro mosome probe. There was a significant increase in the frequency of dis omy in teratozoospermic men compared to controls for chromosomes 13(.23% vs .13%) XX (.13% vs .05%) and XY (.50% vs .30%) (p<.0001 2 tailed Z statistic). This study indicates that men with teratozoospermia andasthenozoospermia but with normal concentrations of sperm have a sig nificantly increased frequency of sperm chromosomal abnormalities. ,2001
455,Most of the Turner patients (UTS) are mosaics. The variability in cytoge netic findings explains some of the phenotypic differences. In patients withmosaic UTS clinical variability results from the unequal tissue distributionof the cell lines and from the type of chromosomal defect. We investigated299 patients because of short stature with or without Turner stigmata or pri mary amenorrhoea. Chromosome analysis was performed from lympho cyte cultures. The karyotype analysis proved X chromosome abnormali ties in 135 cases including 45 mosaics. The non mosaic karyotypes were45 X [62 cases] 46 X i(X) [ 14] 46 X del(Xp) [4] 46 X del(Xq) [6] 46 X r(X) [1] 46 X +mar [3]. The number of mosaic karyotypes investigat ed by GTG was 30 . In addition the 45 X cell line we detected 46 XX [5cases] 46 X i(X) [4] 46 XX/47 XXX [2] 46 X +mar [6] X deletion [4] andY chromosome containing cell line in 9 patients (45 X/46 XY [7] 45 X/46 X t(X Y)[1] 45 X/46 X r(Y) [1]. The karyotypes of 15 patients withTurner phenotype were normal. By reason of clinical symptoms we alsostudied the lymphocyte cultures of these patients by FISH using wcp X DXZ1 wcp Y and DYZ3 probes. FISH demonstrated the presence of asecond cell line with numerical gonosome aberration 45 X [ 7 cases outof 15 ] 47 XXX [1 case] 46 X +mar(X) [2 cases] and of Y containing DNA in 3 patients. In lymphocyte cultures of two patients with UTS phenotypewe detected 46 XX with both methods. We analysed interphase nuclei ofbuccal cells with Xcen in these patients. X monosomy was found in both atlower ( 17 % and 9 % ) frequency . The proportion of the mosaics in ourmaterial was thus 33 33%. The results of chromosome analysis in one cellsystem should be completed by investigation of a second one preferen tially originating from an other germ layer if phenotype karyotype discrep ancies are diagnosed. ,2001
456,The frequency of supernumerary marker chromosome is 0.3 1.0% ininfertile men. Extra marker chromosome might be the cause of meioticarrest and instability in spermatogenesis resulting in infertility of men. Cyto genetic analysis from peripheral blood culture of 9 infertile men (spermdensity <10M/mL) revealed two patients with mosaic supernumerary mark er chromosomes which were present in 93% (case 1) and 3% (case 2) ofcells (n=200). Both marker chromosomes were smaller than G group chro mosomes and C banding positive. In case one the AgNOR stainingshowed that the marker chromosome was bisatellited. There were alsoboth t(14q 21p) and trisomy 21 confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridi sation (FISH) in 3% and 2.5% of cells (n=400) respectively. But they wereabsent in skin fibroblasts. The karyotype was mos47 XY +mar/46 XY +t(14q 21p) +mar/48 XY +mar +21/46 XY. Case oneshowed that supernumerary marker chromosome might cause through theinteraction with other chromosomes major chromosomal anomalies as tri somy 21 and t(14 21) which are the real cause of sterility. In case two themarker chromosome was present only in 3% of metaphases and karyotypewas interpreted as mos 47 XY +mar/46 XY. This case indicates that in evenwith very low frequency the supernumerary marker chromosome might beassociated with infertility of men. ,2001
457,The study was performed to determine the specific chromosomal abnor malities of the azoospermic infertile men from the department of Urology ofOsmangazi University. The karyotypes of 30 cases were determined fromGTG and C banded metaphases of peripheral blood samples. Of 30analysed azoospermic infertile men 25 had normal karyotypes but theremaining 5 cases showed some chromosome abnormalities. One casehad mosaic 46 XY/47 XYY (80/20) karyotype one case had 46 XY isoYp two cases showed 47 XXY and the other showed 46 XY t(15 19). Thekaryotypes of two cases with structural chromosomal abnormality werealso confirmed by the FISH analysis. In the review of literature it has beendiscussed that autosomal translocations especially the ones of acro centrics could possibly be the reason of infertility since the abnormalities inNOR regions of the translocated chromosomes cause false X/Y recombi nations during the meiosis. The reported cases with autosomal transloca tions support this hypotesis. Our case is especially important because ofbeing another example supporting this mechanism. ,2001
458,Robertsonian translocations are the most common structural chromosomeanomalies in man. Carrier of the translocations may result in offspring withchromosomaly unbalanced which may cause spontaneous abortion orphenotypically abnormal individual although the carriers are phenotypical ly normal. Therefore analysis of the chromosomal constitution of theirsperm nuclei can be helpful in assesing this risk in individual situation. Wehave used dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on decon densed sperm heads from carrier of structural chromosome reorganiza tions t(21 21). In addition in sperm nuclei the behavior of the Robertson ian translocation pattern along with sex chromosome was determined. The148 Posters: Cytogeneticspresent study demonstrates that analysis of the segregation pattern of Robertsonian translocation in sperm nuclei gives further information aboutchromosomal abnormalities in sperm and offsprings. ,2001
459,Studies of aneuploidy frequencies in normal sperm by FISH have yieldedvariable results. Past inconsistency resulted in part from variable scoringof closely associated homologous signals. Spatially paired signals may beinterpreted as either disomy or as fragmented target sequences (a splitsignal ). Martin et al. (1995) proposed that two signals be scored as dis omy only if separated by one signal s diameter or more. This reduced datavariability but the criterion s appropriateness remains undetermined. Toaddress this we estimated disomy 9 frequency using two chromosome three color FISH. Alpha satellite centromeric sequence and adjacent hete rochromatic region probes were used concurrently. A probe for chromo some 18 was used to determine ploidy. We score essentially haploid cellsas disomic for chromosome 9 only if we observe two signals for both itscentromeric and heterochromatic targets regardless of the distancebetween them. A cell with three signals for 9 regardless of the distancebetween the two signals from the same target is interpreted as monosomy9 with a split signal. Based on 30 644 sperm from three normal donors weestimate the disomy frequency to be 0.11%. Centromeric and heterochro matic sequence split signals occurred at frequencies of 0.9% and 1.2%respectively. Disomic cells with signals separated by less than one diame ter were nearly three times as common as monosomic cells with greatersplit signal separation. With either chromosome 9 probe alone and the cri terion of Martin et al. the disomy frequency would have been 0.07% roughly a 50% underestimation. Chromosome 1 results will also be pre sented. ,2001
460,Recurrent pregnancy loss is a well known clinical manifestation of variousetiological factors. Convincing evidence on the causes of recurrent preg nancy loss is meager. Several factors are associated with recurrent preg nancy loss few of them included genetic/chromosomal environmental eti ologies infectious agents maternal congenital acquired anatomic abnor malities immunologic endocrinologic dysfunctions and some are partlyinfluenced by hereditary factors. During the period of past 2 years a totalof 96 couples were referred for cytogenetic analysis with a history of twoor more abortions without recognizable gynecological causes for the con firmation of possible chromosomal anomalies. After the detailed family his tory and pedigree analysis routine PHA stimulated peripheral blood cul tures were set up and karyotyping was done after GTG banding and otherbanding techniques were performed as required. A high incidence of12.5% (n=12) of chromosomal abnormalities was observed among 96 cou ples referred (i.e. both structural and numerical). Those included 4.2% withbalanced reciprocal translocations (N=4) 3.1% with pericentric inversions(n=3) and 5.2% with gonosomal aneuploidies/mosaicisms (n=5). In addi tion to these chromosomal heteromorphisms and single cell abnormalitieswere also found in 11.4% (n=11) and 2.1% (n=2) respectively. These datasuggests that couple with a history of two or more abortions should beinvestigated cytogenetically. DNA microsatellite and FISH analysis are inprogress in few patients found with rare chromosomal translocations. ,2001
461,In this survey 733 cases with abnormal menstruations have been investi gated. All cases were referred to our Center from 1979 till 1999 and cyto genetically have been studied by G banding method as routine and C andQ banding in some cases.554 of 733 cases (75.6%) had primary amenor rhea 122 cases (16.6%) had secondary amenorrhea and other 57 cases(7.8%) had oligomenorrhea. The mean age (+/ SD) was 21.8 (+/ 5.7) years. The most common cause for referring was primary amenorrhea(66.0%) followed by secondary amenorrhea (15.1%) and oligomenorrhea(5.9%). Other main complaints were infertility and short stature. 561 cases(76.5%) were cytogenetically normal (46 XX) and 172 cases (23.5%) hadabnormal karyotypes mostly 46 XY (59 cases 8.0%) and 45 X (30 cases 4.1%) followed by 45 X/46 X iso(Xq) and 46 X iso(Xq) (respectively 2.0%and 1.9%). Other abnormal karyotypes were structural abnormalities ofchromosome X consist of deletion of Xp and Xq and ring (X) trisomy X (a47 XXX cell line with or without 45 X and/or 46 XX cell lines) marker X Robertsonian and X autosome translocations. Also there were 14 cases ofpericenteric inversion of chromosome 9. This study revealed that the mostcommon cause of menstrual disorders among the patients reared aswoman is 46 XY followed by Turner syndrome and its variants. ,2001
462,Chromosomal anomalies usually invoked as one important etiology thatshould be considered when a couple has spontaneous abortions. In thiswork we present the results of 481 cytogenetic studies corresponding to481 trophoblasts of spontaneous abortions in a 10 years period. We had382 (79 4%) positive cultures and 162 (42%) had chromosomal alteration. The most frecuent structural alterations were desbalanced translocations(6 2%). We studied five pairs(50%) of parents of this group and we fondalways a balanced translocation in one of them. We believe that the highratio of translocations in the parents may be reflecting more frecuent chro mosomal rearrangements in the descendants of couples with balancedtranslocations as has been recently suggested in preimplantational stud ies. ,2001
463,Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is now widely acknowledged as themost effective therapeutic approach to severe male infertility. However one problem raised by ICSI is the potentially elevated genetic risk associ ated with this technique. Some of the genetic anomalies observed in chil dren born after ICSI arise de novo without a predisposing parental chro mosome aberration others may be derived from a predisposing abnor mality present in one of the parents. Moreover several studies have shownan increased frequency of constitutional chromosome aberrations in maleand female partners of couples examined prior to ICSI. Nevertheless many questions have not been broached such as the meaning of low levelsex chromosome mosaicism. When an abnormality is seen in a low per centage of cells sex chromosome mosaicism by banding is suspected tobe an artefact but can we be too categorical? Cytogenetic investigationswere performed in 379 patients (179 males and 200 females) prior to ICSItreatment. Control groups were obtained from 194 males and 227 femaleswho underwent a standard cytogenetic examination because of familychromosomal abnormalities (excluding the gonosomes). At least 16 cellswere karyotyped. The routine analysis was performed on R banded chro mosome preparations. Sex chromosome loss or gain was observed in atleast one cell from 24.5% of ICSI females against 22.03% of controlfemales (p=0.70). X chromosome loss was observed in at least one cellfrom 20.5% of ICSI females against 18.94% of control females (p=0.69).Nevertheless we found a significant difference between these two groups(p=0.01) if we considered X chromosome loss in at least two cells 8% forICSI females against 2.64% controls. No significant difference in X chro mosome gain (47 XXX or 48 XXXX) was found between ICSI females andcontrols. Sex chromosome loss or gain was observed in at least one cellfrom 10.61% of ICSI males against 9.79% of control males (p=0.79). Nosignificant difference was observed between male groups concerninggonosome loss (45 X) or gain (47 XYY and 47 XXY). These results sup ported previously published studies indicating that the loss of one X chro mosome in only one cell in females undergoing ICSI is probably an arte fact. Nevertheless these results suggest that when two 45 X cells arefound the patient could have true low level sex chromosome mosaicism. In this case we recommend confirmation of mosaicism by fluorescence inPosters: Cytogenetics 149situ hybridization (FISH) before discussing the expected risk of chromoso mal aberrations in the offspring of the infertile couple. ,2001
464,The phrase Bad Obstetric History has been used because it avoids thestigmas engendered by abortion and habitual . The term bad obstetrichistory includes not only couples with recurrent abortions but also with still births and offspring with multiple congenital anomalies. Abortion is themost common complication of pregnancy and is responsible for significantemotional distress to couples desiring children. Karyotyping of 104 coupleswith bad obstetric history was done after ruling out other etiological factors(anatomical infectious hormonal seminal). Using conventional as well asmolecular cytogenetic techniques (FISH) detection of the chromosomalabnormality and confirmation has been done. In this study cytogeneticanalysis revealed chromosomal abnormalities in 20 out of 104 couples(19.23%). Major chromosomal abnormalities have been found in 5 out of104 couples (4.80%) and minor chromosomal abnormalities (variants) in15 out of 104 couples (14.42%). The major chromosomal abnormalitieswere X mosaicism (45 X/46 XX) 3 cases of Reciprocaltranslocation{46 XX t(7 8)(q31 p22) 46 XY t(7 13)(q31 q32) 46 XY t(4 6)(4 15)(p12q21 q15q26)} and Robertsonian translocation{45 XY t(13 14)} During counseling the chromosomal cause of bad obstet ric history has been explained with a request for follow up including pre natal procedure. ,2001
465,The aim of this study was to detect numerical changes of sex chromo somes in dividing and non dividing nuclei of peripheral lymphocytes ofmales and females with previously diagnosed KlinefelterÃÂ«s and T urnerÃÂ«s syndrome using interfase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I FISH). Wecompared clinical findings with cytogenetic results determined the differ ences in sensitivity of classical and molecular cytogenetic methods andestimated control values for healthy males and females. 26 males withKlinefelterÃÂ«s syndrome and 18 females with TurnerÃÂ«s syndrome wereexamined. In males with KlinefelterÃÂ«s syndrome the mosaics with47 XXY/46 XY karyotype was found by I FISH in all patients small celllines with numerical sex chromosome changes were ascertained in 8cases (33%). In 7 females with TurnerÃÂ«s syndrome I FISH proved kary otype 45 X. Remaining 11 females had chromosome mosaics of two ormore clones. In all females I FISH confirmed the results of classical cyto genetic methods and in 6 females (30%) it revealed other clones previ ously not detected. As a control 10 healthy males and 10 healthy femaleswere examined and mosaics of gonosomes were not detected. The cutt offlevel for the VYSIS probes used was 2 5%. The examination of fibroblastscultures by I FISH would prove the existence of the sex chromosomemosaics in different tissue. This would be important finding specially inpatients with KlinefelterÃÂ«s syndrome. Study was supported by grants GAUK 30/96 and GACR 302/98/0071. ,2001
466,The SRY gene on the short arm of the X chromosome is necessary formale development. Without SRY patients with the 46 XY karyotype devel op as females fail to achieve normal puberty and have dysgenic gonadswith high incidence of gonadoblastoma. We report a female fetus abortedat 17 weeks of pregnancy with a non mosaic 46 X del(Y)(p11.2).ishdel(Y)(SRY ) karyotype diagnosed by classical cytogenetics and FISH. Ovarian tissue was full of oocytes and mitotic figures. FISH studies ofparaffin embedded ovarian tissues with the X and Y centromere probesrevealed extensive sex chromosome mosaicism manifested by loss of theY chromosome and replication of the X chromosome. We propose that theX chromosome replication is a post zygotic event that arises to facilitategonadal differentiation in the absence of all the factors necessary for nor mal gonadal development. ,2001
467,A childless couple was reffered for cytogenetic examination because oftheir reproductive problems after eight years period of sterility and twospontaneous abortions the last pregnancy ws interrupted following ultra sound examination. The anomalies detected at 11 weeks of gestation bythis early ultrasound evaluation suggested a fetal chromosomopathy. Lateron we performed cytogenetic analyses of both partners using convention al banding techniques. The husband had a normal karyotype but the wifewas found to be a carrier of a balanced reciprocal translocation t(13 18).The consequences of this gross structural chromosomal rearrangementsare discussed. Our results are important for the genetic counseling andrecommendation for prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies. ,2001
468,There are presented two phenotypically normal females of 21 and 23 yearsold respectively diagnosed as primary amenorrhea. First case S. M. wasreffered for cytogenetic investigation at 21 years age because of her men strual cycle began at 17 years and was intermittent. At the time she pre sented herself for karyotype exam she was under hormonal tretment. GTGbanded karyotypes revealed cellular mosaicism 45 XX 14 +18p/46 XX +18pter (20%/80%). The presence of supplementary frag ment on the short arm of 18 chromosome was found both in 45 and 46chromosome metaphases which could explain the failure of prescribedhormonal therapy meant to regulate her cycle. Hypodiploidy was associat ed with chromosome 14 monosomy and we cannot exclude that the sup plementary fragment on 18p might come possibly from 14. We considerthis feature which is peculiar to this case involved in the primary amenor rhea developed by our subject meanwhile we excluded X chromosomeinvolvement. The second case M. I. 23 years old with primary amenor rhea exhibited a mosaicism 45 XX t(20 21)/ 45 nan,2001
469,The paper presents the case of two marital couples with a large number ofmiscarriages in the first trimester of gravidity. The analysis of karyotype ofperipheral blood has indicated the presence of two very rare triple translo cations. In one case we had 46 xy t (5 8 15) (p13 p21 q13) and inanother 46 xx t (2 8 13) (p13 p23 q22). The paper also discusses thepossibility for having healthy offspring. ,2001
470,In this study FISH analysis has been carried out in the sperm samples of10 normal males and 13 fathers of children with trisomy 21 totally 23males. The purpose of our study is to detect the hybridization efficiencyand segregation frequencies by using locus spesific probes of chromo some 21 and 13. In our study 23 420 nuclei have been examined and thehybridization efficiency is determined as 97.9 %. 13 420 nuclei of our casegroup have been examined. As the control group a total of 10 000 nucleiwere analysed (Table1). In conclusion disomic spermatozooa can beeffective in the formation of aneuploidic embryo. However to increase thereliability of the method of aneuploidy screening on the fathers of childrenwith Down syndrome paternity test have to be performed and the number150 Posters: Cytogeneticsof donor series have to be increased. Table 1 ,2001
471,We report six cases in two families and a sporadic case with a dirdup(8)(p21.3p23.1). In one family the duplication started in the mother andwas transmitted to one son and one daughter. In the second family thefather was mosaic for the anomaly which was transmitted to his two daugh ters. In each case the cytogenetic anomaly was initially described as a8p+ with banding analysis. These were further studied with fluorescence insitu hybridization using whole 8 painting 8p specific painting and 8p sub telomeric probes. Deletion was not detected in the subtelomeric region ofthe short arm of the abnormal chromosome 8 examined in one family andin the sporadic case. The phenotypic picture varies from normal to moder ate mental reardation in the affected individuals. No obvious dysmorphismor congenital defects were consistently observed among these cases. Aftercomparing the chromosome region involved in our cases with those in oth ers having direct or inverted duplications of 8p it is thought that the seg ment 8p21.1 >21.3 might be the critical region for a 8p duplication syn drome. The parental origin of the duplication does not seem to impact onits clinical significance. ,2001
472,An increasing number of structural chromosomal aberrations is consideredto be a clinically recognizable condition mainly through a distinctive phys iognomy and malformation pattern. This holds true also for terminal dele tions of the long arm of chromosome 18 originally identified by Grouchy etal.1964. We report on a 19y old girl affected by a distal deletion of 18q and in addition pure monosomy X. We would like to discuss the impact of therespective aberrations on the clinical features. Interestingly there is a con siderable overlap of the features of both conditions mild mental retarda tion triangular face carp like mouth microcephaly unusual concave deepset nails and bilateral club foot refer mainly to the autosomal deletion some other facial features eg the deep hair line epicanthus ptosis thedown slanting palpebral fissures mirror the well known Turner syndromeaspect. No hearing impairment or cardiac failure was diagnosed. Growthretardation a common finding in both clinical pictures resulted in a finalheight of 143cm. Cytogenetic investigation let assume the breakpoint in18q22 but this remains to be proven by FISH to date. More complexrearrangements or only interstitial deletion were excluded by subtelomericFISH analysis. Multiplex PCR investigation for possible Y chromosomesequences was uneventful. Hormonal results revealed the exspectedhypergonadotrophic insufficiency of the ovary but could not detect anyabnormal response of GH to provocative agents. Self esteem and socialacceptance improved markedly by psychological and hormonal support. Toour knowledge this patient represents the first case of Turner syndromeinvolved in this particular autosomal anomaly. ,2001
473,We report a new case of intrachromosomal triplication of the proximal15q11 q13 region. At our knowledge it is a rare chromosomal disorder. Our propositus is a 22 year old boy with severe developmental delay andepilepsy. Cytogenetic R bands analysis suggested the presence of addi tional material on the proximal region of one chromosome 15. FISH analy ses with probes from the Prader Willi/Angelman region showed this regionis triplicated on the abnormal chromosome the middle segment beinginverted in orientation. Then the patient is tetrasomic for the 15q11 q13region. Molecular studies using microsatellite and RFLP analyses demon strated that the triplication is maternal in origin with two alleles beinginvolved. It is interesting to note that tetrasomies 15q11 q13 with intra chromosomal triplication as those associated with supernumerary inv dup(15) chromosome most often result from rearrangements occuring atmaternal meiosis. In both situations the dosage of maternal/paternalimprinted regions is identical and in the absence of mosaicism pheno types are expected to be similar. We compare the phenotype of our patientwith that of patients from these two classes of tetrasomy 15q11 q13. Final ly we propose a mechanism to explain the formation of intrachromosomaltriplication. ,2001
474, magdeburg.deDeletion and other abnormalities of human chromosome 15q11 q13 areassociated mainly with two developmental disorders Prader Willi syn drome and Angelman syndrome (AS). Despite the advanced analysis ofthis critical region and the identification of new genes the exact genotype/ phenotype correlation is still unclear especially in translocation patients. We report on a girl with an unbalanced translocation whose breakpoint fallswithin the 15q11 q13 region. The patient presented some features ofAngelman syndrome as mental retardation speech impairment develop mental delay microcephaly hypopigmented skin light hair and eye color. Other clinical features typical for AS such as ataxia are missing. GTG banding and FISH analysis of the patient detected a derivative chromo some 14 due to an unbalanced maternal inherited translocationt(14 15)(q13 q11.2). The der(14) resulted in a partial monosomy 15p13 q11.2 and a partial trisomy 14p13 q13. SNRPN is not deleted and AS hasbeen excluded by methylation analysis. YAC FISH was performed for thedetailed breakpoint characterization. The breakpoint on chromosome 15lies proximal from YAC 254b5 and very close to the centromere. Therefore it is unlikely that the partial monosomy 15 mainly af fects the patientÃÂ«s phe notype. The break point on chromosome 14 lies between YAC 855c06 andYAC 950b08 resulting in a trisomic segment of about 30 cM. However thepatientÃÂ«s phenotype is not similar to that of other patients with proximal tri somy 14q. But pure trisomies of chromosome 14 are rarely described anda correct genotype / phenotype correlation is difficult. Our data suggestthat a pure trisomy 14p13 q13 may generate an AS like phenotype. ,2001
475,We report 6 cases in which complex chromosome rearrangements(CCR s) w ere observed each with varying clinical manifestations from normal to severe congenital anomalies in a series of 5000 postnatal chro mosome studies. In all cases at least 3 breakpoints and 2 chromosomeswere involved. In cases 1 3 (see karyotypes below) an inversion of onechromosome was present with a translocation involving a second chromo some. In cases 4 5 CCR s involved 3 way reciprocal translocations. Case6 involved 2 chromosomes in which a portion of one chromosome wasinserted into the X chromosome. The G banded karyotypes are below Case 1 46 XX der(2)inv(2)(q14q23)t(2 3)(p15 q27)Case 2 46 XY der(12)inv(12)(q21.3q24.1)t(1 12)(q42.3 q24.3)Case 3 46 XX der(5)inv(5)(p13p15.1)t(5 8)(q23.2 q22.1)/46 XXCase 4 46 XY der(7)t(7 13)(p11.2 q14.3)t(7 21)(q11.2 q22.3)Case 5 46 XY t(1 7 14)(q32.3 p21.2 q21.2)Case 6 46 X ins(X 8)(p22.1 p23.1p23.3)All cases are apparently balanced rearrangements. Three of the CCR s(1 2 and 4) were phenotypically normal individuals with a history of repro ductive problems. Three of these CCR s (3 5 and 6) were studied for anindication of developmental delay or phenotypic anomalies. There are few reports of CCR s in the literature implying that these eventsare quite rare. However it is possible that CCR s occur more frequentlythan expected from the literature. Our data suggests that balanced formsof these events may even be fairly common in the population. It appearsthat genomic material itself and not the number of breaks and chromo somes involved may influence phenotype. Only balanced forms of CCR sPosters: Cytogenetics 151 HAPLOIDY (%)DISOMY 21(%)DISOMY 13(%)DIPLOIDY (%) CONTROL 95.28 0.49 0.3 1.26 CASES 92.57 1.6 0.6 1.3were observed in this study. Although CCR s have the potential to giving rise to unbalanced forms a high rate of gamete loss may explain theirscarcity. ,2001
476,The characteristic features of duplication 9p syndrome include severemental/growth retardation microcephaly deep set eyes carp mouth VSD umbilical hernia and 5th finger clinodactyly. Epilepsy may also be presentin some patients. We report on a female infant with typical features of the9p trisomy syndrome associated with multiplex hemangiomatosis and sen soneurinal deafness. High resolution analysis and fluorescent in situhybridisation using the chromosome 9 specific painting probe detected ade novo partial duplication of 9p [dup 9(p21 p23)] as part of a complexchromosome rearrangement. A balanced translocation [t(10 22)(q26 q12)]was found in the patient and in her symptomless father without any alter ation of the short arm of chromosome 9. Patients with balanced transloca tions involving chromosomes 10 and 22 are seldom described. The denovo duplication of a chromosome other then the chromosomes involvedin the rearrangement in an offspring of a translocation carrier has not beenreported yet. The new partial duplication of chromosome 9 in associationwith (10 22) translocation in our patient could be related to a possible insta bility of the balanced chromosomal rearrangement. ,2001
477,The San Luis Valley Syndrome (SLVS) is due to a recombinant chromo some 8 resulting from a recurrent pericentric inversion in a population ofHispanic ancestry originating from the San Luis Valley in Colorado(AJHG 2000 66 1138). We report on a 4 years old boy born to unrelatedSpanish parents. He presents with severe mental retardation right sidedspastic hemiplegia and brain malformations (agenesis of corpus callosum left frontal cortical dysplasia hydrocephaly). He shows facial dysmorphismwith large low set ears hypertelorism pterygium colli pectus excavatum but no cardiac defect. Prometaphase chromosome analysis reveals arecombinant chromosome 8 with a pericentric inversion (p23 q22) andduplication 8(p11 p22). This duplication is confirmed by CGH. The break points of the pericentric inversion 8(p23 q22) are similar to those reportedin the SLVS chromosome 8 variant. However whereas the rec(8) observedin the SLVS consists in dup(8)(q22 qter) and del(8)(p23 pter) in our casethe rec(8) includes dup(8)(p11 p22) and no detectable deletion by CGH. The clinical features in our patient are indeed compatible with the dup(8)syndrome. Molecular tools are now used in order to study the breakpointsregions and explore a possible link with the SLVS. ,2001
478,Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive condi tion characterised by progressive microcephaly early retardation ofgrowth chromosomal instability hypersensitivity to ionising radiation andimmunodeficiency predisposing to recurrent infections and malignancies inchildhood. We report a case of a newborn with some clinical features ofNBS and usefulness of combination of clinical examination classical cyto genetics FISH and molecular methods in establishing of correct diagnosis. The newborn is the 2nd child of young healthy and genetic unrelated par ents. He is hypotrophic with unspecific somatic stigmatization micro cephaly facial dysmorphism and heart abnormality (ASD). The karyotypeof the child was 46 XY add(4)(q35) de novo with chromosomal breaks in4% of metaphases. We revealed the origin of additive material on 4q asdup(4)(q31.1qter) using the whole chromosome painting probe 4 andtelomere probe 4q combined with G banding technique. The translocationt(14q 21q) was also in 4 metaphases by FISH detected. The suspiciousclinical diagnosis of NBS was excluded because the deletion 657del5 inNBS1 gene on 8q21 was not detected. We compare the similarity of clini cal picture of our patient with cases with duplication of distal part 4qdescribed in the literature. ,2001
479,During the past 20 years and among more than 25000 peripheral bloodkaryotypes we have detected 6 cases of add(10)(q25). All of these caseswere referred between 1 12 months of age with multiple congenital anom alies including severe growth retardation congenital dislocation of the hip bilateral club feet high bossing forehead narrow face with saggingcheeks broad nasal bridge harelip or cleft palate small round chin largeposteriorly rotated low set ears hyperflexed limbs hypoplastic genitaliaand severe hypotonia. In 5 of the cases their parents karyotypes werestudied and 3 of the fathers and 2 of the mothers had a pericentric inver sion in chromosome 10. The inversion involves the short and the long armwith breakpoints at p11 and q25 resulting in a long acrocentric chromo some 10. This identified the karyotype of the children asrec(10)dup(10p)inv(10)(p11q25). One of the families did not participate inthe study. Prenatal diagnosis has been performed for two of the families revealing a normal fetus in one and a trisomy 10p in the other. ,2001
480,152 Posters: Cytogenetics90 percent cases of DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) with variable clinical man ifestation conotruncal congenital heart diseases craniofacial dysmorphia hypocalcemia immunodeficiency psychiatric disorders are due to22q11.2 microdeletion. Estimated incidence of 1/4000 live births is rangingDGS among the most frequent microdeletion syndromes. Peripheral bloodof 86 patients suspect from DGS was investigated by FISH using LSIprobe (Vysis) between 1997 2000. At 24 patients the microdeletion wasfound. 23 from them had congenital heart defect. Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)Ã¢\x80\x9439 % and interrupted aortic arch (IAA) Ã¢\x80\x9435 % were the most frequentones. At one case the microdeletion was inherited from mother with formefruste of DGS. Epidemiological and clinical consequences of DGS are dis cussed. ,2001
481,The Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes are two distinctmental retardation syndromes that are caused by either microdeletions oruniparental disomy of the same chromosomal region. The deletionsresponsible for PWS and AS have been localized to band 15q11 q13 ofchromosome 15. PWS is characterized by infantile hypotonia with feedingproblems short stature small hands and feet almond shaped eyes hypogonadism psychomotor retardation hypopigmentation and develop ment of obesity. AS is characterized by severe mental retardation seizures inappropriate laughter ataxic gait puppet like upper limb move ments lack of speech large mandible hypopigmentation an open mouthwith protruding tonque and microcephaly. We report the results of molec ular cytogenetic and clinical studies on 29 patients suspected for PWS orAS. During the last 2 years we diagnosed 4 patients with deletion 15q11 q13 using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with D15 S10 andSNRPN DNA probes. In patients without a cytogenetic deletion molecularstudy of uniparental disomy for chromosome 15 was performed. Based onour results we analyzed the clinical criteria and typical phenotype featuresfor patients having deletion 15q11 q13 or uniparental disomy. ,2001
482, Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is characterized by severe growth andmental retardation typical facial appearance and seizures. It results fromthe partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 4 (4p16.3). In mostreported cases the deletion can be detected by conventional chromosomeanalysis while in some cases a microdeletion can only be detected bymolecular probes. This study presents a male patient with WHS who diedwith 37 years. He carried a karyotype 45 XY der(4)t(4 13)(p16 q11)mat 13. A balanced translocation could be observed in his mother and grand mother. His brother presents mild mental retardation minor phenotypicalterations and a karyotype 47 XY +der(13) t(4 13)(p16 q11). The sameextra derivative chromosome 13 was also present in one of his three chil dren a girl who has the same phenotype as her father. Fluorescent In SituHybridization (FISH) was performed using LIS WHS Microdeletion Probe(Vysis) revealing two signals in the balanced translocation one in the nor mal chromosome 4 and one in the derivative chromosome 13. Thus bothgirl and her father have partial trisomies for 4p16 pter and 13pter q11 while the WHS patient had monosomy for the same segments althoughthe unbalance for the chromosome 4 is the relevant one for the phenotype. It is an unusual balanced translocation as it results in two different unbal anced gametes from 3 1 disjunction both giving viable individuals. One ofthem could be fertile and transmit the extra derivative chromosome. Theunbalanced gametes arising from 2 2 disjunction in this translocationwould probably be less compatible to life.

483,12p trisomy phenotype is a subject that has been debated in the literature. Even though patients with pure 12p trisomy are rare there are severalreports on patients carrying it by translocation with other autosomes. Twobrothers have been recently referred to our service.

Both childrenwere males and aged 8 and 2 years when genetically and clinicallyassessed. Cytogenetic analyses of both patients revealed karyotypes 47 XY der (21)t(12 21)(12 pter > 12p11.21 21q 11.1 > 21p 11.1) analyzedby banding techniques GTG CBG high resolution and FISH.

Thepatients two sisters presented balanced translocation 12/21 an extrachromosome of the sexual pair and karyotype 47 XXY t (12 21) (Kline felter Syndrome associated with balanced translocation). The patientshave the 12p trisomy classical phenotype. The brother of the patient withKlinefelter Syndrome is likely to be another example of interchromosaleffect on maternal meiosis resulting in the chromosome X non disjunction.

Familial examinationgave the same pericentric inversion in the two oldest sibs of the proposita(Kaiser et al. 1984 Clin Genet 26 73 76). Examination of the younger sis ter had been refused by the parents. This younger sister had three con secutive miscarriages. Chromosomal analyses had not been carried out onthe fetuses. Only during the fourth pregnancy she was diagnosed to carrythe familial pericentric inversion. Chorionic villus sampling was performedwhich led to the loss of a chromosomal healthy fetus. In a fifth pregnancyno prenatal cytogenetic analysis was carried out and a boy was deliveredby caesarean section because of fetal distress at 35 weeks of gestation. Stenosis of the aortic isthmus was noted. At the age of 5 months he pre sented with developmental delay. He had minor facial anomalies includingeye abnormalities and a characteristic shape of the ears. The phenotypewas very similar to the proposita. Cytogenetic investigation showed thesame imbalanced karyotype (rec dup(14q)). We therefore propose a dis tinctive multiple congenital anomaly / mental retardation (MCA/MR) syn drome due to partial trisomy of distal chromosome 14q. We discuss therecombination risk of the given inversion and compare the clinical andcytogenetic data with previously reported cases on trisomy 14q. A longterm follow up of the proposita is given. ,2001
484, nancy.frThis report describes a new patient with unusual clinical signs which arerelated to a partial trisomy 6p and monosomy 6q. The patient born in 1983 is the first of a normal father born in 1956 and a normal mother born in1959. Pregnancy has been uneventful. She was born at the term of 38weeks with normal birth lenght and weight. Head circumference was slight ly decreased at Ã¢\x80\x942 5 SDS. During the first days of life biological evidencesof renal insufficiency lead to the diagnosis of a left renal dysplasia withbilateral ureteral reflux. Cytogenetic examination was reported as normal. Developmental milestones were delayed with the walk present after 18months of life. Language did not appear before 4 years of life with evidenceof nasal speech. At 13 years height and weight were in the 50th centile. Pubertal development was normal. The mean IQ was evaluated at 53 withmental progression around 7 years of age. The facial dysmorphism wasmild with microcornea strabism asymetrical right ptosis prominent nasalbridge low set ears and prognathism. Halluces and thumbs were broadand symetrical shortening of the 4th metacarpal and metatarsal boneswere also reported. The progression of renal insufficiency lead to kidneytransplantation in 1998. Her mother reported two early miscarriages at the6th week of gestation in 1998 and 1999. The cytogenetic reevaluation ofthe patient and her parents gave the following results mother 46 XX inv(6)(p23q27) patient 46 XX rec(6)dup(6p)inv(6)(p23q27)mat. The patient has a trisomy of the 6pter 6p23 and monosomy of the 6q27 6qterregions. Compared to the data of the literature the cytogenetic anomaliesare identical to the case reported in 1993 by Wauters. To the difference ofthat clinical report our patient did have neither short stature blepharophi mosis nor cardiac malformations . The shortening of metacarpal andmetatarsal bones have not been reported so far. ,2001
485, Unbalanced chromosomal anomalies can lend information on the positionof genes and on the understanding of pathologic mechanisms of common diseases. Thus one locus for asthma and allergic disease a multifactorialtrait has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5. We report on apatient with a partial trisomy of chromosome 5 and significant asthma andallergies. The patient presented at 6 years of age congenital heart disease (ASD VSD PDA) developmental delay severe eczema asthma numerous foodallergies and elevated serum IgE. The blood karyotype showed extramaterial on the short arm of chromosome 22. Spectral karyotyping (SKY)revealed that the extra material on chromosome 22 originated from chro mosome 5. FISH studies with BAC probes were undertaken to determinethe extent of chromosome 5 trisomy. BACs mapping to 5q34 and 5q35 allhybridized to the der(22). The child s karyotype is thus 46 XX der(22)t(? 22)(? p11.1). ish der(22)t(5 22)(q34 q11.1) (wcp5+ D22Z4+ D5S400+ D5S2006+). Parents karyotypes were normal. The patient illustrates a case of pure partial trisomy of 5q34 5qter as loss of 22p material is non significant. The distal 5q trisomy genotype has beenassociated with clinical signs that include growth and mental retardation eczema craniofacial anomalies and malformations of heart lungs andgenitalia many of which our patient presents. The trisomic region does notinclude the chromosome 5 interval (5q31) linked to asthma and allergic dis ease. However numerous genes potentially involved in heart development(hCsx MSX2) IgE levels (H2R) and asthma and allergic response (LCT4synthase LCP2 H12 3) have been mapped to this chromosomal region. ,2001
486,Dicentric structure having only one active centromere is called pseudodi centric. Such chromosome is able to overcome the cell divisions success fully and is a stable structure in constitutional karyotype. We report on twounrelated infants with the typical for Down syndrome phenotype features inboth. Their karyotypes had pseudodicentric chromosome constructed dueto two chromosomes 21q22 junction. No prenatal chromosome studies hasbeen done in both cases. Chromosome analyses were performed afterstandard preparation of PHA stimulated lymphocyte cultures with subse quent GTG and C banding respectively. Cytogenetic studies of GTG banded metaphases showed that proposita I a newborn female havekaryotype 46 XX psu dic (21 21)(21pter >21q22 21q22 >21pter) +21. Theanalysis of C banded chromosomes showed the presence of the secondcentromere region in pseudodicentric chromosome. The parental kary otypes were found normal. Proposita II was newborn male with typicalDown syndrome features his karyotype was 46 XY psu dic (21 21)(21pter >21q22 21q22 >21pter) +21. The parental karyotypes were normal too. Cytogenetic aspects of de novo pseudodicentric chromosomes are dis cussed. ,2001
487,"Robertsonian translocations that most commonly give rise to secondary tri somy 13 are rob(13q13q). Over 90% of rob(13q13q) are ascertained as denovo rearrangements in trisomy 13. Recent studies (Shaffer et al. 1994)demonstrated that 3 of 4 cases with homologous rearrangements of chro mosome 13 resulting in trisomy 13 were isochromosomes. We presentresults of molecular analyses in a case of de novo homologous chromo some 13 rearrangement [rea(13q13q)]detected in an abortus specimen. An abortus specimen was collected from a 37 year old G3 P0 SAB2woman following diagnosis of a missed abortion at 8 weeks gestationalage. Cytogenetic studies revealed the karyotype of the abortus to be46 XX 13 +rea(13q13q)de novo. Using 10 micro satellite markers fromchromosome 13 it was determined that this rea(13q13q) was a maternal ly derived isochromosome and that there was no recombination involved inthe rearrangement. This would suggest that the isochromosome formedpostzygotically. However a meiotic origin can not be excluded. These posi ble mechanisms of isochromosome formation will be discussed.154 Posters: CytogeneticsP0280.

Linkage analysis ofthis pedigree localized the critical region to an interval of 6 cM on chromo some 12p11. Interestingly chromosome rearrangements associated withsimilar phenotypes involving the same chromosomal segment were report ed (Nagai et al. 1995 Baehring et al. 1997). We have previously describeda translocation with breakpoint on 12p11 cosegregating with typical fea tures of brachydactyly E in four generations. Cytogenetic and molecularstudies revealed that the breakpoint is located 3 Mb proximal to the criticalinterval for brachydactyly E and hypertension. Breakpoint spanning YACand PAC clones were identified. Partial sequencing of clones provided acomplete sequence of 150 kb spanning the breakpoint. By Southern blotanalysis we could demonstrate that the open reading frame of the parathy roid hormone like hormone gene (PTHLH) which was supposed to be agood positional candidate for brachydactyly is not disrupted. Other candi date genes are now under investigation. The identification of the break point will enable us to discover genetic factors contributing to brachy dactyly E and might give insight into the etiology of brachydactyly E asso ciated with hypertension.

488,CHARGE Association is a non random occurrence of congenital malfor mations that has been described in clinical series inclusion criteria for theCHARGE Association are at least four of the major features (monolateralor bilateral coloboma of the eye heart defect atresia of the choanae retarded growth and development genital hypoplasia criptorchidism earanomalies and hearing defects). Cleft lip and palate or high arched palate velopharingeal insufficiency micrognathia facial palsy esophageal atre sia malakoplakia of the colon cerebral anomalies have been alsodescribed in the clinical spectrum. All of the features of CHARGE Associa tion occur more or less expressed in the series of patients who have dele tions within chromosome band 22q11 (Ryan et al. 1997). Viceversa not allcases of CHARGE Association show the 22q11 deletion. We report theobservations of a long follow up study of four children two females andtwo males with CHARGE Association in two of them FISH and molecu lar analysis revealed a deletion in the critical region 22q11. In the other twochildren who were negative for the 22q11 deletion we are now analysingthe PAX2 gene for deletion and nucleotidic variations of the codingsequence because the pattern of expression of PAX2 suggests that genesencoding downstream targets effectors could be candidate gene for theCHARGE Association (Tellier et al 2000). ,2001
489, bonn.deA 25 year old healthy G1P0 female underwent amniocentesis at 16 weeksof gestation because of abnormal triple test results. Ultrasound examina tion demonstrated isolated bilateral choroid plexus cysts. Karyotype analy sis from amniocytes revealed an unbalanced de novo Y/autosome translo cation [45 X t(Y 8)]. A molecular genetic investigation with 30 specificsequence tagged sites (STS) located between Yp11.32 and Yq11.23excluded partial deletions in Y euchromatin. At that time no subtelomericprobes for chromosome 8p were available and the parents were informedabout the remaining risk of a terminal deletion of 8p. At birth the boy pre sented with average body measurements and an unremarkable physicalexamination. FISH with a probe of the subtelomeric region 8p (LocusD8S2333) confirmed a monosomy 8pter to 8p23. The boy showed nodevelopmental peculiarities until a speech delay was diagnosed at the age of two years. On examination at 42 months he presented with very milddysmorphic features including a dolichocephalus supraorbital fullness ofsubcutaneous tissue and a bulbous nasal tip. The Denver DevelopmentalScreening Test revealed a psychomotor delay of almost 18 months. Termi nal deletions of the short arm of chromosome 8 reported previouslydemonstrated a common breakpoint 8p23 in the majority of patients. Ingeneral the children show mild to moderate mental retardation and onlyminor facial dysmorphisms. Physical abnormalities mainly include heartdefects seizures and behaviour difficulties. Although the factors responsi ble for a normal spermiogenesis (TDF AZF) are present in the boy infertil ity in adulthood due to disturbed XY pairing in meiosis I must be expected ,2001
490,More than 30 cases of interstitial deletion of chromosome 6q have beenreported in the literature with variable breakpoints and clinical features. Four of them displayed clinical features suggestive of Prader Willi syn drome. Here we report a fifth case of interstitial 6q deletion and Prader Willilike phenotype. The probant was described as floppy and with feedingproblems in early infancy. He sat at age 2 walk at age 3 ? and the speechwas very poor at age 5. His behaviour was hyperactive with short atten tion span and intolerance to frustration. Excessive weight began at age 3 with a big appetite and food seeking behaviour. At physical examination atage 5 weight was +5.5 SD height was 1 SD and OFC was + 2.5 SD. Hehad slight dysmorphic features including a square face large forehead small palpebral fissures mild strabismus thin nose and thin lips. Handsand feet were small external genitalia were normal. Investigations showedabsence of malformations a normal methylation assay in the SNRPNregion and normal FISH study with the SNRPN probe. However cytoge netic examination showed an interstitial deletion of chromosome 6q del(6)(q16.1q21). Karyotypes of the parents were normal. Parental originof the deletion is in progress. This observation confirmed that individualswith a Prader Willi phenotype and normal cytogenetic and molecular stud ies of the 15q11 q12 region should be examined for a deletion 6q. It isworth noting that the 6q16.2 band is common in 4 out of the 5 cases. ,2001
491,Partial deletions of the short arm of the X chromosome are known to bePosters: Cytogenetics 155compatible with fertility in some cases but they cause a significant ovarial insufficiency with Turners signs or gonadal dysgenesis in other cases. Wereport a family in which a mother (54 years old) and two daughters (27years old) with short stature but without other Turners stigmata had thesame chromosomal anomaly. The standard cytogenetic technique (QFH)and FISH with locus specific DNA probe (Xp21.1) revealed non mosaickaryotype 46 X del(X)(qter p21.1 ). As revealed by RBA technique theabnormal X was always late replicating in all the examined cells. One ofthe sisters has an eight month old daughter with normal karyotype 46 XX. The other sister has now 37 weeks pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis demon strated normal female karyotype in this fetus. Our investigation suggestthat plural genetic factors on both arms of human X chromosome areinvolved in ovarian development. ,2001
492,It is well known that unbalanced translocations are mostly familial andcytogenetic analysis of parents usually reveal the reciprocal exchange ofchromosome segments identified in a given unbalanced rearrangement. Inthis report we present an unexpected cytogenetic finding of chromosomerearrangement transmission. Our patient is 23 month old girl with shortstature failure to thrive moderate mental retardation deficiency if IgG mild facial dysmorphism no malformation or abnormalities of visceralorgans. Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood and fibroblast revealed akaryotype of 46 X der(X)t(X 6)(q22 p11). Cytogenetic investigation of thefather revealed normal karyotype (46 XY) while the mother presented46 XX/46 XX der(10)t(6 10)(p11 p11) in the peripheral blood and 46 XXwas observed in fibroblasts culture. We suggest that unusual mosaicism inthe mother is due to unstable 6p11 region leading to the jumping non homologous postzygotic recombination involving chromosome 10(observed) and X (not observed) at S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. The moth er transmitted to her daughter der(X)t(X 6) and normal chromosome 6. ,2001

495,We present a boy with some features suggestive of Beckwith Wiedemannsyndrome and additional congenital anomalies prenatal onset of over growth birth weight 3 710 g birth length 50 cm and head circumference35.4 cm at 33+4 (or possibly 35+5) weeks gestation (all above P97) dys morphic ears (but no clear earlobe crease) no evident macroglossia hypertelorism a right epicanthic fold deafness transient hypotonia withhypoventilation transient cardiac hypertrophia of ventricles internipple dis tance >P97 abdominal hypotonia with diastasis recti right dysplastic kid ney and left congenital hydronephrosis due to pelviureteric obstruction. The G banding pattern of lymphocyte metaphases was interpreted as46 X ?t(Y 11) (q11.2 q13.3). FISH using whole chromosome paints of chro mosomes Y and 11 confirmed the translocation. Despite a negative DA DAPI staining result presence of Y heterochromatin could be demonstrat ed with probe pY3.4. The der(11) chromosome showed a hybridisation sig nal on 11q13.4 with BAC 120P20. A subtelomeric probe specific for 11phybridised to both arms of the der(11) chromosome. A subtelomeric probespecific for 11q hybridised to the q arm of the der(Y) chromosome but notto the der(11) chromosome. Therefore the karyotype was eventuallydefined as 46 X ?t(Y 11)(q11.2 q13.3). ish der(Y)t(Y 11)(q12 q13.4) der(11)t(11 11)(q13.4 p15.5).This resulted in a duplication of 11p15.5. Thepossible mechanism of origin will be presented. Trisomy 11p15.5 of pater nal origin results in an overexpression of insulin like growth factor 2 (IgF2).This is probably responsible for the partial expression of features of theBeckwith Wiedemann syndrome in this case in particular the overgrowth. ,2001
496,156 Posters: CytogeneticsWe report on a newborn boy with a partial monosomy 13(q31.3 qter). After an uneventful pregnancy he was born at term birth weight was 3170 g length 50 cm head circumference 33 cm. Because of hypospadia in com bination with bifid scrotum blepharophimosis and anophthalmia cytoge netic analysis was performed. An unbalanced translocation46 XY der(13)t(9 13)(p24.3 31.3) was found. His mother shows a balancedtranslocation 46 XX t(9 13)(p24.3 q31.3) Therefore the patient has a partialmonosomy 13q31.3 qter combined with a partial trisomy of the telomericsegment of 9p. MRI of the brain showed hypoplasia of corpus callosum absence of optic nerves and chiasma opticum with only tiny hypointensestructures in both orbits. A critical region for major organ development hasbeen assigned to 13q32. Genes involved in various types of eye anomalieswere mapped to 13q but non for anophthalmia so far. By subsequent cyto genetic analysis of the family 4 carriers of the balanced familial transloca tion in three generations were identified. One 27 years old uncle of thepatient with mild mental retardation congenital heart defects micro cephaly and clinodactyly showed the corresponding unbalanced translo cation with partial trisomy 13q and partial monosomy for the very telomer ic segment of 9p. Detailed mapping of both chromosomal breakpoints willimprove our understanding on the molecular basis of malformationsobserved in cytogenetically unbalanced members of this family. ,2001
497,The syndrome of microdeletion 22 can includes cardiomyopathy aplasticor hypoplastic thymus and parathyroid glands cleft palate and a peculiardysmorphic facies. Heart malformations usually include interrupted aorticarch arteries truncus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot numerous associ ated abnormalities are observed. The disorder frequently progresses topsychomotor retardation with a 50% chance of mental retardation. Theaffection is due to a microdeletion on chromosome 22 in the q11.2 area. We describe here three cases of microdeletion 22.The first case is a Cayler syndrome. The patient is one year old boy. Hehas consanguineous healthy parents two brothers and one sister normal. The patient has asymmetrical crying facies Asymmetry of the mouth whencrying with drooping of the left corner Retrognathism high arched palate abnormal ears umbilical hernia bilateral cryptorchidism and congenitalheart disease ventricular septal defect associated to septal anevrism. Hehas a delayed psychomoteur developement. Cardiofacial syndrome is described by Cayler (Omim 125520) in 1967.This syndrome associates asymmetrical crying facies (ACF) due tohypoplasia or absence of the depresor muscle of the angle of the mouthand congenital heart disease. Incidence of ACF is estimated of 0.63% to0.82% per live birth 2.5% to 8% of these children have congenital cardiacdefects. The second case was a girl with psychomoteur retardation shehas speech defect retroverted ears bulbous nose micrognatia heart dis ease microcephaly arachnodactyly and ear anomaly. The third case was a girl with a malformative syndrome with tetralogy offallot ptosis of the reight eye epicanthus hypertelorism and deficit of cel lular immunity. In the three cases cytogenetic study by double FISH D22S75 (DGCR)localised in 22q11.2 and D22S39 (Control Probe) in 22q13.3 showed amicrodeletion of 22q11.2 region (D22S75).This deletion has been described in Cayler syndrome included in CATCH22 group. The other cases are member of CATCH 22 group with different clinicalsigns who push us to ask the question when we must search themicrodeletion 22 ? In most cases microdeletion is de novo but we have todetect it in parents for genetic counselling. ,2001
498,Charcot Marie Tooth 1A disease (CMT1A) is a peripheral neuropathyassociated with a submicroscopic tandem duplication on the short arm ofchromosome 17. The 17p11.2 region contains the peripheral myelin pro tein 22 gene (PMP 22) the dosage of which plays a crucial role in the aeti ology of the disease. The CMT1A duplication is not visible by standardcytogenetic analysis but is detectable by FISH analysis of interphasenuclei and extended chromatin fibers (ECFs FISH). We have analyzed 24 members of 7 families 9 patients with clinical symptoms of CMT1A dis ease and 15 normal individuals. The use of fibers FISH with thepVAW412R3 pVAW409R3 and 17 SpectrumOrange probes has resultedin the detection of a duplication in 8 patients. However 100% of duplica tion was only in 4 of them. In the next 4 patients the mosaicism for 17p11.2duplication was detected in 30 80% of analysed chromatin fibers. 6 normalindividuals were shown to have the mosaicism in 10 80% of analysed chro matin fibers. We conclude that mosaicism for the CMT1A duplication inpatients and members of their families could be successfully diagnosed bywell established ECFs FISH method. This work was supported by StateCommittee of Science Grant No 4.PO5A.081.13. The FISH results wereworked out owing to computer system (MetaSystems GmbH) purchasedby Foundation for Polish Science. ,2001
499,Mirror duplications of chromosome 21 are a rare cause of Down syndrome different from the usual i(21q) or homologous Robertsonian translocations. Theoretically they could arise as a result of telomeric fusion or subtelom eric translocation between two chromosome 21 homologues or as a resultof illegitimate exchange between sister chromatids. Pangalos et al. (1992)demonstrated by molecular methods in their three cases that they were infact reverse tandem duplications with a deletion of distal 21q22.3. As nomosaicism was observed they favoured prezygotic origin of the rearrangedchromosome. Our case concerns a prenatal diagnosis for Duchenne mus cular dystrophy. At CVS the short term culture demonstrated a 46 XX kary otype in 14 cells while in all 14 cells of the long term culture a 46 XX 21 +der(21)t(21 21)(q22.3 q22.3) karyotype was observed. The sameabnormality was found in all 31 amniocytes analysed and after terminationof the pregnancy in fetal skin kidney and liver. No evidence of mosaicismwas found. Both parents have normal karyotypes. Most likely therearranged chromosome has arisen after fertilisation. Other mechanismsare conceivable but would require an unlikely second event. Ultrasound at19 weeks showed no abnormalities suggestive of a Down phenotype. Aftertermination only minimal dysmorphic signs consistent with Down syndromeand no heart defect were found. The results of DNA analysis characteris ing this unusual chromosome rearrangement are presented. ,2001
500,"Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman AS) syndromes are multigenic disorderscharacterized by developmental and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Dif ferent underlying genetic defects cause loss of expression of genes locat ed either in paternal or maternal 15q11 q13. Approximately 70% of PWSand AS patients have a deletion in 15q11 q13 whereas uniparental disomy(UPD) accounts for 25% of PWS cases and 2 3% of AS. A small numberof patients have a mutation at the imprinting center. UBE3A gene is mutat ed in 20% of AS. To confirm the presumptive clinical diagnosis of PWS orAS in 62 Chilean patients we used a methylation specific PCR assay FISHanalysis and classical cytogenetics 23 out of 37 PWS patients had posi tive scores according to the HolmÃÂ«s consensus diagnostic criteria (PWS Agroup) the remaining 14 patients were not completely evaluated under thiscriteria (PWS B group). AS patients were evaluated with the consensus cri teria. In 17 out of 62 cases (27.4%) the molecular analysis confirmed theclinical diagnosis of PWS or AS 34.8% in the PWS A group 21.4% in thePWS B group and 24% in AS patients. Those cases with a positive methy lation test were analyzed by FISH. Classical cytogenetics showed struc tural rearrangements in 2 PWS cases 46 XY del(15)(q11 q13) 45 XX del(15)(q11 q13) der(13 14)mat and one with normal molecu lar analysis 46 XY t(5 7)(q12 q31). These results confirm that HolmÃÂ«s cri teria is of great assistance in PWS and suggest that definitive clinical diag nosis of PWS and AS must be confirmed by molecular and cytogeneticsanalysis.

It appears that the trisomy 9p syndrome in its variantforms including trisomies for more or less than just the short (p) arm isone of the most common clinical autosome anomalies in humans exceed ed only by trisomy 21 (Down s syndrome) and possibly trisomies of chro mosomes 13 and 18.

501,We report on the characterization of a de novo reciprocalt(X 15)(p11.3 q26) in a girl with multiple congenital malformations. Deliveryoccurred at term (39 weeks) with 2220 g birth weight .Head circumference(34 cm) and length (54cm) were normal. Several dysmorphic features wereobserved including facial stigmata hands with abnormal morphology andulnar deviation hypoplastic fifth toe and shortened fifth metatarsal. Radi ographically a hypoplastic corpus callosum and variant Dandy Walker cystwere observed. She had a poorly differentiated liver a neonatal muscularhypotonia and suffered from a not treatable epilepsy. At the age of 16months she died. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated an apparently bal anced reciprocal translocation with breakpoints in Xp11.3 and 15q26.Replication banding analysis from EBV transformed lymphocytes showedinactivation of the derivative X chromosome in 98%. FISH analysis result ed in the identification of a spanning YAC (ICRFy900C1228) for the Xp11.3breakpoint and BAC bA89K11 for the 15q26 breakpoint respectively. Nosmaller clone was identified for Xp breakpoint. Interestingly the serinethreonine protein kinase PCTK1 was mapped within a BAC that flanksthe region at the telomeric site and extends with its 5 end into the break point region. Thus we suggest that disruption of PCTK1 is not well tolerat ed and forces activation of the non rearranged X chromosome. This couldlead to functional disomy for most of Xp and functional monosomy of15q26. The hypothesis that these functional aneuploidies are responsiblefor the phenotype is supported by data from the literature where similarphenotypic abnormalities are described for patients with monosomy 15q26and functional disomy of Xp. ,2001
502,The patient a newborn boy born at term from healthy parents had a varietyof abnormalities. Initial examination immediately after birth showed anapparently normal boy. Eleven hours later the boy was transferred to theintensive care unit due to feeding difficulties. More detailed examinationrevealed a number of facial hand and nail heart and genital malforma tions. These included microopisthognathia low set ears bilateral mal formed elicosis of ears broaden nasal tip lycostoma ulnar deviation of the5th finger clinodactily of the 5th finger toe nail hypoplasia cardial anom alies abnormal external genitalia hypospadias muscle hypotonia hyper telorism craniosynostosis polysyndactily etc. The patient was referred to our center for cytogenetic analysis. Chromosome preparations wereobtained from PHA stimulated lymphocytes. Chromosomes were stainedusing G banding techniques. The karyotype revealed one structurallyabnormal chromosome 7 specifically a deletion of the short arm of chro mosome 7. The breakpoints were on the short arm of chromosome 7bands p21 to pter. The karyotype is 46 XY del(7)(p21?pter). Fluorescencein situ hybridation using a Cytocell Chromoprobe T 7ptel/qtel showed 7pteland qtel signal on one chromosome 7 but only 7qtel signal on its homo logue. No consistent 7ptel signal was detected elsewhere. FISH resultsconfirmed a deletion of a 7ptel sequence on one chromosome 7 that hasnot been translocated to another chromosome. In our case both parentshad normal karyotypes indicating a de novo partial deletion of the shortarm of chromosome 7. ,2001
503, hop paris.frShort stature in females is often caused by monosomy X or deletion Xp. We report on a mother and three of her 4 daughters with short stature assole phenotypic anomaly. Patients and methods The first and the thirddaughter of healthy unrelated parents were referred for retarded growth atages 5.5 and 3 years respectively. The father1s height was 170 cm andthe mother1s 156 cm. In both sisters growth had been delayed since birth below the 3 percentile. Except short stature physical examination provedentirely normal. Abdominal and cardiac ultrasound examinations were nor mal. Blood laboratory tests gave normal results for renal functions RBCand WBC counts thyroid hormones cortisol LH and FSH. Bone matura tion was delayed in both girls. The second daughter did not present anygrowth retardation whereas the fourth daughter was examined at the ageof 24 months while her growth was slowing down to the 5th percentile. Chromosomal analysis were performed in both parents and the four sis ters. The three affected girls were put on growth hormone therapy withgood initial results. A fifth pregnancy began a few weeks ago. Both con ventional and molecular cytogenetic analyses showed deletion of bandXp21.2 in affected patients. Conclusion Isolated Xp21.2 deletion resultedin this family in isolated retarded growth whereas all other physical abnor malities encountered in Turner syndrome were absent. Moreover the hem izygoty of the chromosomal region Xp21.2 is not associated with ovarianfunction anomalies. These results are useful for genetic counseling of indi viduals with partial monosomy X. ,2001
504,Williams and CATCH22 syndormes represent two clinical syndromes withmultiple involvmen with well recognized genetical varities. We present 14patients (7 with Williams and 7 with CATCH22 syndrome) in whom thediagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of deletions with fluorescent insytu hybridization (FISH). Williams syndrome is generally characterized bymental deficiency gregarious personality unusual elfin faces supravalvural aortic stenosis and idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia. Patiens with Williams syndrome show a hemizygous submicroscopic dele tion of 7q11.23 detectable by FISH. The deleted portion of the choromo some corresponds to the elastic gene. We report 7 patient (3 girls and 4boys) with characteristics of Williams syndrome and FISH varified dele tions of 7q11.23. These patients showed the characteristics faces and gre garoius personalities. Cardiac evaluation revealed in all 7 children pres ence of supravalvular aortic stenosis (2 underwent surgical procedure byDoty) and in all 4 patients peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Hypercalcaemiawas not documented in these patients. Learning difficulties are present inall patients. Chormosome analysis done on peripheral blood were found tobe normal in all patients. CATCH22 syndrome the acronym (Cardiacdefect Abnormal face Thymic hypoplasia Cleft palate and Hypocal caemia) as a concept that compromises DiGeorge syndrome velo car dio facial syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome is con nected with submicroscopic 22q11.2 deletion. We present 7 patients withCATCH22 syndrome with 22q11.2 microdeletion. Major cause of morbidityin those children was congential heart disease (CHD) (4 with tetralogy ofFallot 2 with persistent truncus arteriosus and 1 child with pulmonary atre sia). Other phenotypic characteristics included abnormal facies (hyper 158 Posters: Cytogeneticstelorism low set small ear lobes and micrognatia). Clinical findings of immunodeficiency were present in 4 and hypocalcaemia in 3 children respectively. One child has cleft of soft palate. All of the CHD s are suc cesfully corrected surgically. ,2001
505, net.ruRett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with theincidence of 2.5% in mentally retarded girls in Russia. We have performedcytogenetic studies of 70 patients (67 girls and 3 boys) with clinical pictureof RTT selected according to the criteria for diagnosis of RTT developedby B. Hagberg (Hagberg et al. 1996). Collection of DNA samples and fixedcell suspensions of RTT patients (37 girls and 2 boys) and theirs parents(27 patients) was established for molecular studies for example analysisof MECP2 mutations in Russian cohort of RTT patients. Among 70patients 67 girls with clinical picture of RTT were with normal female kary otype (46 XX) one boy was with normal male karyotype in cells of blood(46 XY) and two boys were with mosaic form of Kleinfelter s syndrome(47 XXY/46 XY) in blood and muscle cells. 24 mothers and parents of RTTgirls were with normal karyotype two mothers Ã¢\x80\x94 with mosaic forms of Turn er syndrome (45 X/46 XX) and one mosaic karyotype(47 XX +mar/48 XXX +mar). We analysed chromosome X in lymphocytesof 67 affected girls with clinical picture of RTT using BrdU + Gimsa stain ing technique (Vorsanova et al. 1996). Specific type of inactive chromo some X (so called type C ) with unusual staining of chromatin in long armof the chromosome X was found in 66 (from 67) girls with RTT. This tech nique was positively used for presymptomatic diagnosis of RTT in five girlsin affected families. We believe that the phenomenon of altered chromatinconformation in inactive chromosome X could be used as laboratory testfor preclinical diagnosis of the RTT.

506,Molecular cytogenetic studies of chromosomal micro anomalies at sub telomeric chromosomal regions have been conducted by two step fluores cence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 407 children with mental retardation. A large set of cosmid BAC and PAC clones containing simple telomericsequences (TTAGGG)n was identified by FISH mapping. These cloneswere located in the most telomeric and subtelomeric regions as well asnon telomeric regions of p and q arms of different chromosomes. Weused original simple two step FISH protocol. Availability of large insertionPAC probes which contain DNA sequences common for telomeric and partially subtelomeric regions of all human chromosomes including p andq arms allowed us to marl all telomeric regions in one FISH study. There fore first FISH study for each patient was performed with large insertionPAC probe specifically marking telomeric and subtelomeric regions of allhuman chromosomes. If some chromosome arm had absence of telomer ic hybridization signals or the intensity of hybridization signal was reducedin comparison to homologues chromosome arm we used second DNAprobe which is strongly specific to definite telomeric region of individualchromosome. Deletions of chromosomal material involving telomericregions were detected in 14 (3 4%) cases from 407 patients with severeand mild forms of mental retardation and apparently normal karyotypesrevealed by classical banding techniques. Microdeletions were detected infollowing chromosomal loci 4q35.2 5p15.33 9q34.3 10q26.3 (twocases) 11q25 13q34 16q24.3 18p11.32 (three cases) 18q23 21q22.2and 22q13.33. These data demonstrate that undifferentiated forms of men tal retardation could be associated with nonspecific telomeric micro aber rations of different chromosomes. FISH studies using specially developedpanel of telomeric DNA probes could be useful for identification of gener ally undetermined forms of mental retardation. This work was supported inparts by COPERNICUS 2000 grants. ,2001
507,Subtelomere FISH analysis was performed in two separate studies. Thefirst was performed on individuals with dysmorphic features and develop mental delay/mental retardation selected by clinical geneticists primarilyfrom two centers. The second group consists of individuals with DD/MRreferred to our clinical service laboratory. In both groups all individuals hadprevious G banded karyotype analysis with the first group at the 500 bandlevel or higher the banding level is unknown for most of the second group. Probes developed by Vysis Inc. were used in both studies. Seventy onepatients have been analyzed in the first group with only one abnormalitydetected (1.4%). An additional 35 patients from this group will be reportedat the meeting. The one rearrangement is a der(18)t(2 18)(pter qter). Areciprocal t(2 18) was detected in one of the parents. In the clinical refer ral population 5 abnormalities were detected in 124 patients (4.0%). Oneof these abnormalities i(Yp) does not explain the child s phenotype leav ing four abnormalities that are potentially clinically significant (4/124 =3.2%). The abnormalities detected are (1) der(18)t(10 18)(pter qter) (2)del(9)(qter)de novo (3) del(18)(q23) and (4) der(18)t(16 18) (pter pter). Incase (4) the 16p subtelomere probe is distal to the intact 18p subtelomereprobe. Parental studies have not been completed on this case. When kary otypes were re reviewed cases (1) (2) and (4) were cryptic rearrange ments and (3) had a cytogenetically visible deletion. A more detailed phe notypic analysis will be presented on a subset of these patients. Bothgroups show a lower hit rate than the largest published study (7.4% + 3% Knight et al. Lancet 354 1676 81 1999). In addition to the severity of MR studies may also show differences in the detection rate depending on thequality of previous karyotyping and on the number of polymorphismsencountered. No confirmed polymorphisms were seen with this probe setin either group reported here such as the common 2q variant as seen withother probes. Some cross hybridizations were noted with this probe set but these have not been bright enough to present problems. ,2001
508, erlangen.deDeletions within human chromosomal band 4p16.3 cause Wolf Hirschhorn/Pitt Rogers Danks syndrome (WHS/PRDS) which is charac terized by profound mental and developmental defects. Although a Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome critical region (WHSCR) of approximately 165 kbhas been defined based on two atypical interstitial deletions the genotype phenotype correlation remains controversial due to the large deletionsizes of usually several megabases. We report the first known patient witha small de novo interstitial deletion restricted to the WHSCR who present ed only with a partial WHS phenotype consisting of low body weight forheight and mild facial anomalies. Further hallmarks of WHS such as short ness of stature microcephaly seizures and major mental retardation weremissing. The deletion was initially demonstrated by FISH analysis andbreakpoints were narrowed down with a mini FISH technique with 3 5kbamplicons. A breakpoint spanning PCR assay allowed to define the distalbreakpoint as disrupting the WHSC1 gene within intron 5 exactly after anAluJb repeat. The proximal breakpoint was not found to be associated witha repeated sequence or a known gene. The deletion size encompasses191.5 kb and includes WHSC2 but not nan,2001
509,Earlier studies demonstrated a monoallelic mode of expression in somepre cancerous and invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix as well asin multiple myeloma . A high rate of asynchronic pattern has beendescribed in 1. lymphocytes of individuals with solid tumors as well as inother malignancies. 2. amniocytes of genotypes with an extra chromosome13 18 and 21. 3. lymphocytes of young mothers of a Down syndrome preg nancy. The asynchronic pattern was not locus specific and was found in allloci analyzed. These findings suggested that the mechanism controllingthe temporal order of replication could be altered in cells with a geneticpredisposition to cancer or aneuplody. In this study we found a higher rateof asynchronic pattern in genotypes carrying inversions 2 and 9 and in bal anced heritable translocations (p<0.01) and even higher rate in in caseswith a de novo balanced translocations (p<0.05). The process of tumorgenesis may begin with change in cell cycle regulation which includes theduplication replication and segregation of genetic information. However itremains unknown whether individuals with balanced chromosomerearrangement are at increased risk of developing cancer later in life. ,2001
510,The entry of mammalian cells into mitosis is regulated by the activation ofan evolutionary highly conserved protein complex (cyclinB/CDK1) leadingto nuclear envelope breakdown chromosome condensation and spindleassembly. Premature chromosome condensation can be induced experi mentally if the activated complex is introduced into an interphase cell. Here we report on two sibs of consanguineous parents born afteruneventful pregnancies in 1993 and 1995. At birth they presented withmicrocephaly cranial and body growth remain well below the 3rd centile. Neuromotor development was delayed and combined with profound men tal retardation. They had a normal karyotype with poor chromosome mor phology normal rate of sister chromatid exchanges and a slightly elevatedrate of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations. Most conspicious was the high frequency of prophase like cells with intact nuclear membrane ( 10%)in lymphocyte lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cultures. Already 1h after 3 H thymidine application a significant percentage of these cells waslabelled indicating that the length of the G 2 phase is drastically reduced. Flow cytometric analysis revealed no obvious disturbances in the cell cycleprogression. Thus all data are consistent with premature entry of the cellsinto mitosis. To the best of our knowledge this combination of cytogeneticand clinical findings has not been reported before. It is logical to assumethat a gene involved in cell cycle regulation is mutated in these patients. ,2001
511,Rett syndrome (RTT) is probably caused by mutations in the methyl CpGbinding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene on chromosome Xq28. In RTT patientsthe defective MeCP2 might fail to keep other genes silent . Mutations inMeCP2 as well in other genes encoding proteins that functionally inter acting with MeCP2 could be involved in pathogenesis of RTT. The dys regulated genes which are under control of MecP2 are still unknown. Therefore the identification of target genes whose expression is undercontrol of MeCP2 will help to fully explain the cause of RTT and developadequate treatment of RTT. FISH using chromosome X specific genomicDNA probes was applied to determine the loci with altered replication andtranscription at RTT. Randomly selected PAC clones for Xp Xce and Xqwere used. It was found that two clones from Xq28 (anonymous clone nan,2001
512,Using the G banding technique we examined lymphocytes from ninetyindividuals (43 males and 47 females median age 31) living in buildingsconstructed with radioactively contaminated rebar. Forty five non exposedcontrol subjects (22 males and 23 females median age 30) matched tothe radiation exposed individuals by sex and age were selected for com parison. At least 500 metaphases were checked for each individual. All rec ognizable structural aberrations of chromosomes or chromatids wererecorded. After adjusting for age and smoking status both the precentageof cells with aberrated chromosomes (PCAC) and the number of aberrat ed chromosomes per 100 cells (NAC) were found to be significantly high er in the radiation exposed females than in the control females (p<0.05 forPCAC and NAC). This difference however was not observed in the com parison of radiation exposed vs. control males. It suggests a possible inter action between sex and radiation exposure in their effects on chromosomeaberrations. Neither the duration of exposure nor the cumulative exposureshowed a significant correlation with PCAC or NAC. ,2001
513,The radioisotope 131 Iodine has a half life of 8.02 days and is used in160 Posters: CytogeneticsNuclear Medicine for scintigraphy of the thyroid with an average activity of 3.7 MBq. It is also used in other dosages for metastasis detection and incase of ablation. There are no conclusive results yet as to the effect of thedosage of 131 Iodine used in scintigraphy of the thyroid on patients. Theobjective of this study was to evaluate the effect of that dosage on chro mosomes from human lymphocytes. Cells from 21 patients from HospitalUniversit rio Clementino Fraga Filho were placed in enriched 1640 RPMImedium and incubated for 48 and 72h at 37oC. Blood was collected 24hours after administration of the radioisotope. Blood cells collected fromthe same patients prior to the administration of 131 Iodine were used ascontrol. Chromosomes were stained with Giemsa Gurr (2% pH=6.8) andanalyzed under optical microscope. Of 6300 metaphases analyzed fromthe 48h cultures 1146 gaps and 682 breaks were found in the test group. Of 6300 metaphases analyzed from the control group 291 gaps and 119breaks were found. These results are significant in a paired t test (p<0.05).In the 72h cultures of 6300 metaphases analyzed 216 gaps and 52breaks were found in the test group. Of 6300 metaphases analyzed fromthe control group 10 gaps and no breaks were found. These results arealso significant in a paired t test (p<0.05). Our results show that 131 Iodineis responsible for the chromosomal alterations observed. ,2001
514,We suggest an approach that allows to individualize the karyotype insta bility evaluation. This approach is based on simultaneous analysis of sev eral parameters of karyotype instability. Any person may reveal high (H) orlow (L) level of instability by each of parameters. A series of levels of insta bility (H or L) of all parameters is an individual characteristics of person sgenome instability. A number of individual variants is equal 2 n where n is a number of investigated parameters of genome instability and number 2is a number of groups (H or L) of instability. We have studied three parameters of karyotype instability (levels of chro mosomal aberrations polyploid mitoses and diplochromosomes) undertwo way cultivation of human lymphocytes. First way (52 hours cultivation)reveals immediate karyotype instability in first mitosis second way (144 hours cultivation) allows to detect delayed karyotype instability in fifth mito sis. The additional information obtained under two way cultivation allowedus to separate donors into four groups (instead of the two) of instability ( LL LH HH HL) according to their individual characters of karyotype instabili ty by each parameters. The number of individual variants that may be dis tinguished with this approach is 4 3=64. Some individual variants were sta tistically significantly more frequent and some less than it could be expect ed from distribution of the donors by every studied parameters. We mayexplain it by two reasons by common mechanisms that lead to differentmanifestations of genome instability and by selective elimination of per sons with certain individual characteristics of karyotype instability. ,2001
515,Nonsteroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) have wide use in medicalas well as surgical clinics for their analgesic antiinflammatory andantipyretic effects. In this study we investigated the in vitro effects of non selective (naproxen) and selective (etodolac and meloxicam) NSAIDs onthe frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in their maximum ther apeutic concentrations. SCE is a reliable test for the evaluation of DNAdamage caused by various physical and chemical agents. We found thatthe mean SCE frequencies in the naproxen (8 microgram/ml) etodolac (15microgram/ml) and meloxicam (2 microgram/ml) groups were 7.81 Ã¢\x80\x93 2.18 7.63 Ã¢\x80\x93 2.18 and 7.75 Ã¢\x80\x93 2.00 per metaphase respectively. The mean SCEfrequency in the control group was 6.89 Ã¢\x80\x93 1.82. There was no statisticallysignificant difference between the NSAIDs group and the control group inregard to SCE frequency (p >0.05). These findings imply that the anti inflammatory drugs used in this study do not have a genotoxic effect invitro. ,2001
516,The frequency and spectrum of chromosome aberrations in peripheralblood lymphocytes was evaluated in workers of the Siberian ChemicalPlant (SCP) with various integral doses of external gamma irradiation (Igroup 18 37 cGy II group 93 157 cGy) and in inhabitants living in thevicinity of SCP Seversk city (10 km zone) and in radiation safe Kargala set tlement (control group). The frequency of aberrant cells in Seversk citypopulation and two groups of SCP staff was significantly higher in com parison with the control (p< 0.05). High interindividual differences in the fre quency of cells with chromosome damages in I and II groups of SCP work ers were detected. 20% of the inspected workers belongs to a category ofhigh genetic risk having frequency of aberrant cells 4 fold more of sponta neous level. 8 5% of the inspected workers belongs to a category of thepersons with superhigh genetic risk. For them the frequency of cells withchromosome aberrations exceeds a spontaneous level in 10 times andmore. A level of chromosome exchange aberrations (biomarkers of radia tion effect) for the population of Seversk city and control group does not dif fer from a spontaneous level (about 0 1%). For the II group of SCP work ers it exceed at 3 times in comparison with a control level but significantdifferences were not detected. The significantly increase of the frequencyof chromatide aberrations in Seversk town inhabitants and both groups ofSCP workers was revealed (p< 0.05). It testifies for the effect of other thenradiation factors to somatic cells in investigated individuals. ,2001
517,The problem of bronchial asthma is considered to be the burning questionamong children s diseases. Available data suggest that destruction ofgenetic stability of the cells is a key component of bronchial asthma patho genesis. Measurement of clastogenic and anticlastogenic activity of asth matic and nonasthmatic children blood plasma were investigated usingCrepis capillaris seeds (chromosome aberrations assay). In our studies the plasma of 9 nonasthmatic and 13 asthmatic children aged 7 14 with dif ferent degree of the severity of disease were examined. The resultsobtained show that clastogenic effect of plasma of nonasthmatic patients(1.65 Ã¢\x80\x93 0.39) and asthmatic group (1.37 Ã¢\x80\x93 0.35) doesn t differ from the levelof spontaneous mutation 1.14 Ã¢\x80\x93 0.31 (p > 0.05). It is pointed out that theplasma of children with asthma has the low ability to decrease the level ofethylmethane sulphonate induced chromosome aberration compared tothe plasma of nonasthmatic children Ã¢\x80\x94 1.96 Ã¢\x80\x93 0.42 (p> 0.05). Thus in ourinvestigation the new approach for studying bronchial asthma is proposed. This method (chromosome aberrations assay) may be used for determi nation of severity of bronchial asthma manifestations. One may concludethat destruction of normal function of antimutagenic system of asthmaticpatients blood. Therefore for rise of genoprotection activity of blood is nec essary to use the drugs with antimutagenic activity. ,2001
518,According to literature data the rise of chromosomal aberration level wasrecorded in inflammatory processes. Since the asthma is related to chron ic inflammatory diseases therefore in our investigation chromosome aber ration level was studied using lymphocytes of peripheral blood of patientswith bronchial asthma. The first group of asthmatic patients received thetraditional treatment. In addition to that treatment the other group ofpatients received dimepfosphone (30 50 mg/kg per os exposed 7 days).In experimental study the genoprotection activity of dimephosphone wasdemonstrated. The mechanism of genoprotection activity of that drug wasmanifested by activation processes of excision repair and inhibition ofactive oxygen radical. In our studies asthmatic children with differentseverity of manifestation of disease aged 7 14 were examined. Chromo somal aberration level from asthma patients and nonasthmatic controlswas compared. According to the obtaining results level of chromosomalchanges from asthmatic tended to be higher than that from the nonasth matic group (p < 0 001). Reduction of level of chromosomal aberration inPosters: Cytogenetics 161lymphocytes of peripheral blood of patient with light form of asthma by dimephosphone treatment was observed (p< 0.001). At the same time decrease of the number of lymphocytes with chromosome aberration fromchildren with severe of manifestations of bronchial asthma was notobserved (p> 0.05). ,2001
519,Cadmium is a known carcinogenic metal but evidence concerning its geno toxic effects is conflicting. Human daily exposure to cadmium compoundsoccurs primarily through diet drinking water and cigarette smoke. Theobjective of this work was to study DNA damage in human peripheral bloodlymphocytes after a 2 hour in vitro cadmium chloride (CdCl2) exposure. The induction of genotoxic effects using both the electron microscopy insitu end labelling (EM ISEL) assay and the sister chromatid exchange(SCE) test was investigated. The inhibition of cell cycle kinetics due to cad mium(II) was also evaluated. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the TrypanBlue exclusion test in order to select the correct doses of CdCl2 for thegenotoxic assays. The values of labelling intensities obtained by EM ISELin cells treated with slightly cytotoxic (250 uM) or non cytotoxic (125uM 25uM) doses were superior to the values obtained in control cells. A sig nificant increase in single strand break frequencies was observed at bothchromosomal and nuclear chromatin level. In contrast there was no sig nificant difference between the SCE frequency in cells treated with cadmi um and the control cells. However both the proliferative and the mitoticindexes were significantly decreased. These results suggest that cadmi um(II) even at non cytotoxic doses remains an active clastogenic andmitotoxic agent but that the DNA lesions do not induce an increase in SCEfrequency neither at non cytotoxic nor at slightly cytotoxic doses. Thisproject was supported by a grant of Redicy Inc. ,2001
520,During about15 years the selective cytogenetic monitoring among the crit ical groups of Chernobyl accident victims in Ukraine have been fulfilled. Conventional G banding and molecular (FISH WCP) cytogenetic methodshave been used for the examination of the high priority groups. In thedelayed terms following the accident in all exposed groups (patients recov ered from acute radiation sickness ARS clean up workers Chernobylpower plant personnel persons evacuated from Pripyat in 1986 self set tlers from 30 km alienation zone children and adults from regions of oblig atory and voluntary evacuation) the frequency of chromosome aberrations(as integral as specific for radiation exposure) significantly elevated thecontrol levels. The increased number of radioinduced cytogenetic markers(mainly stable) have been discovered in some exposed groups (patientsrecovered from ARS liquidators with stable lymphopenia personnel ofSarkophagus children evacuated from Pripyat persons living and/or work ing in contaminated by radionuclides territories) even with the help of con ventional cytogenetics. Introduction in1996 of modern FISH techniqueessentially improved the possibilities of cytogenetic monitoring in terms ofthe discovery of stable chromosome aberrations (including clones) although under as traditional as molecular cytogenetics a wide interindi vidual variability of cytogenetic effects for the identical radiation exposurehad been revealed. Comparison of the results of the conventional and flu orescence chromosome analysis showed that the discovery of transloca tions under the conventional staining with group kariotyping consisted nomore than 29 % from the level of FISH translocations per whole genome. These data have been confirmed by the results of G banding analysis. Thecalculation of the biological doses on the frequency of reciprocal translo cations in comparison with the official dose records and results of EPR(tooth enamel) dosimetry showed that FISH technique can be used for ret rospective group dosimetry under the doses above 25 cGy and for theindividual dosimetry in dose range ~ 50 300 cGy (in view of aging factor). ,2001
521,The aim of this study was made to investigate effects of GnRHa which isa inhibitor agent of ovarian activity on the frequency of micronucleus some urine and blood parameters ovarian and uterus histology. In thisexperimental study 20 Sprague Dawley female cycling rats aged 2 5 3mounts were used. They were divided into 2 groups. Serum physiologicalsaline to the first group (Control) and 15 mg/day/rat GnRHa to the secondgroup were injected subcutaneously during the experimental period. Onthe 26 th day urine samples were collected for 24 hours from each of theanimals. The end of the experiment (27th day) rats were anaesthetisedwith either and blood samples were collected tissue samples wereremoved and fixed immediately. As a result of the experiment in the 2ndgroup micronucleus frequency SGOT and SGPT activities creatinineclearence urine creatinine urea nitrogen and uric acid increased. Histo logically GnRHa increased the number of corpus luteum and primer folli cles in the ovaries. In addition gland development in uterus tissue of the2nd group was decreased. ,2001
522,Behcet s disease (MIM#109650) is an immunogenetically based multisys tem disorder of unknown pathogenesis and mode of inheritance is notclear. Behcet s disease is characterized by uveitis arthritis orogenitalulcerations and pustular skin lesions. It is most frequently seen in Turkeyand Japan. HLA B5 and its subtypes HLA Bw51 has been found to pre dominate in cases. Recently a triplet repeat (GCT/AGC) microsatellitepolymorphism in the MICA gene was shown that its frequencies were sig nificantly higher in the Behcet s patients than they were in healthy controls. In this study we investigated the chromosomal abnormalities and analysedsister chromatid exchange in patients with Behcet s diseases. Thirty fivepatients with Behcet s diseases (15 patients with uveitis and 20 patientswithout uveitis) and 20 healthy subjects as control were analyzed. Thechromosomal abnormalities and sister chromatid exchange analysis hasbeen performed on lymphocytes. All patients were analysed prior to treat ment. We observed some chromosomal configurations that may indicatecentromer association in patients along with the increased rate of sisterchromatid exchange.

523,Ionizing radiation is an effective treatment for testicular cancer. Incidentalexposure to the healthy testis during radiotherapy (RT) has been shown toinduce deleterious effects on spermatogenesis and semen quality. In astudy of semen quality in 10 seminoma patients sperm concentrationswere significantly reduced at 60 days following RT with partial recoveryoccurring in some patients after 500 days. To investigate the long termgenetic effects on germ cells we applied the multicolor sperm ACM FISHmethod (Sloter et al. 2000) to semen samples from seminoma patients col lected before and after RT. The ACM assay detects (a) partial chromoso mal duplications and deletions which are the sperm products of premeiot ic or meiotic breakage events or rearrangements (b) chromosomal breakswithin 1cen 1q12 and (c) extra or missing copies of chromosome 1. In a162 Posters: Cytogeneticspilot study of six samples from two patients (estimated testicular dose 38 and 55 cGy) a significant 2 to 3 fold increase in the frequency of partialchromosomal duplications and deletions was detected 159 174 days fol lowing RT (P<0.01) which returned to pretreatment range 531 848 daysafter RT. This coincided with a transient 2 to 5 fold increase in numericalabnormalities (P<0.01). RT did not affect the frequency of sperm with chro mosomal breaks (i.e. postmeiotic damage) at the time points surveyed. This work is important for understanding the long term genetic effects ofRT on spermatogonial stem cells. [Work was conducted under the aus pices of the U. S.

524, wuerzburg.deWernerÃÂ«s syndrome (WS MIM #277700) is an uncommon autosomalrecessive condition characterized by many features usually associatedwith aging. Patients with WS also have an elevated risk of cancer. Skinfibroblast cell cultures from WS patients are usually composed of one orseveral clones each marked by a distinctive apparently balanced translo cations designated as ÃÂ«variegated translocation mosaicismÃÂ«. WS fibroblastcultures have a limited capacity to proliferate in vitro and a deletion muta tor phenotype. In the present study spectral karyotyping (SKY) was appliedto two WS fibroblast cell lines (WL and AA) to clarify if there are subtlechromosomal alterations despite the gross chromosomal alterations pub lished so far and to analyse if any chromosomal alterations are responsi ble for a growth advantage. Using the high resolution SKY techniques wediscovered a new type of cyclic rearrangements and could confirm that asubset of metaphases in WS fibroblast cultures appear to maintain a nor mal karyotype. Furthermore we succeeded in establishing a subclone of aWS fibroblast culture (WL) that achieved an unprecedented 43 populationdoublings in vitro. This long lived subclone has a pseudotetraploid kary otype with tetrasomy for all autosomes except chromosomes 4 and 6which are trisomic. Although it is too early to consider this unique subcloneimmortal or transformed the mechanism of polyploidization could havebeen a first step in that direction and explain the exceptional gain in growthpotential. ,2001
525,Genetic screening program for mentally retarded subjects routinely carriedout at our centre revealed the association of a variety of autosomal fragilesites such as 1p36 2q21 2q23 2q31 2q33 3p14 4q31 5q21 5q31 6p23 6q21 6q26 7q31 8q24 9q32 10q21 10q25 10q26 12q24 13q21 14q32 and 22q13 with a frequen cy of 2 20% of expression even in repeated blood cultures and some ofthem are new sites showing association with mental retardation as com pared with the available literature. The possible role of phenotype geno type correlations leading to establishing genetic implications is attemptedkeeping inview of the recent literature. ,2001
526,Traffic police are highly exposed to vehicular pollutants like carbon monox ide nitrogen oxides lead oxide particles suspended particulate matterand diesel exhaust particles as they are on duty for long periods. Peripher al blood lymphocytes were collected from fifty traffic police and analysedfor chromosomal aberrations. Their age ranged from 25 to 58 years.andduration of service ranged from 2 32years. For control data blood samplesfrom 30 men who are not exposed to any pollutants and belonged to thesame age and socio _ economic status were collected. A significantincrease in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations likedeletions breaks gaps dicentrics and fragments was observed in theexposed group when compared to the control group. ,2001
527,Radioactive iodine (131I) has been considered as a safe and effectivetreatment for thyroid diseases such as hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. However the side effects of this treatment were reported by differentauthors. In addition various forms of cytogenetic damages including highrate of micronucleus (MN) and chromosomal aberrations related to radia tion exposure were reported. The micronucleus assay is an effective andalternative method for evaluating genetic damages induced by chemicalsand physical agents. MN assay is a sensitive simple and fast technique todetect effects of clastogenic and genotoxic agents. In our study MN fre quency in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 131I treated patients wasanalysed to detect the possible chromosomal damages related to 1) 131Itreatment 2) in vitro culture statute and 3) the use of colchicine. It was alsodetermined the effects of 131I in the different period after the treatment. The results obtained before treatment were compared with those obtainedat different periods after treatment and other parameters. ,2001
528,DNA viruses that possess episomal genomes such as papillomaviruses must maintain their genomes as stable extrachromosomal elements inhost cells. Long term episomal maintainance of papillomaviruses is shownto be dependent on a chromatin attachment ability of viral genomes. Toaddress the mechanisms responsible for that we examined nuclear com partmentalization of plasmids containing the bovine papillomavirus type 1full length URR and URR deletion constructs in the Chinese hamster ovary(CHO) cell line based model system. From this study we concluded thatBPV1 URR dependent chromatin attachment is determined by viral E2protein in trans and its binding sites on plasmid DNA in cis . Now using E2 antibodies and immunofluorescence as well as FISH analysis we havestudied the determinants of the BPV1 E2 protein that are necessary forURR dependent chromatin attachment. The analysis of different E2 dele tion constructs confirmed the previous reports that both N terminal trans activation domain as well as DNA binding dimerization domains are need ed for E2 mediated linking of the BPV1 episomes to the chromatin. Ourdata suggest that the binding of the E2 protein to host chromosomes isachieved through the interaction of the specific determinants within N ter minal domain of E2 with chromatin. These interactions guarantee the prop er partitioning and nuclear retention of the viral genomes and are likely tobe separable at least partly from interactions involved in transactivationand viral replication supporting activities. ,2001
529,The proband an eight month old girl was born from the first pregnancy occurring against the background of hestosis and anemia. The proband sparents are healthy her mother is 17 Russian and her father is 22 Azer baijanian. The girl s weight at birth was 2750 gr. her length was 50 cm. the head was 33 cm in circumference. During the first days after her birththe syndrome of depression was dynamically substituted by the syndromeof the central nervous system excitement. During the neurosonographicalexamination there was found the lobar form of goloprozencephalia and thedisgenesis of the callous body. At the age of 8 months the girl s weight was4000gr. her length was 60 cm. the head was 36 cm in circumference thegreater fontanelle was almost closed (0 3 * 0 3 cm). The examination dis covered microcephalia the cranium asymmetry brachicephalia flat occip it low forehead hypertelorism apicant Mongoloid form of the eyes wideflat nose bridge long filter low placed dysplastic auricles short neck abrown spot ( 0 5 * 0 5 cm ) on the skin of the pubis. There are some symp toms of heavy disorders of the girl s neuropsychological and physicaldevelopment. The child can not carry her head properly she can not sit orstand does not respond to the surroundings. There were signs of convul sion syndrome and hypothrophy. The citogenic examination by the methodof G colouring discovered the proband having translocation between 5 and6 chromosomes karyotype 46 xx t ( 5 6 ). The mother s karyotype is nor mal 46 xx. The proband s father was not cytogenetically examined. ,2001
530,The DNA based high resolution multicolour banding (MCB) technique cov ers a whole chromosome with differently labelled microdissection probesand thereby allows to investigate the chromosome structure in detail in allstages of the cell cycle. It has been shown that normally prepared chro mosomes in lymphocyte interphase nuclei show a similar MCB pattern asmetaphase chromosomes. To analyse the structure and the shape ofhuman chromosomes 5 in interphase lymphocytes were routinely cultivat ed and harvested for chromosome analysis. Three dimensionally intactinterphase nuclei were obtained by drying of the suspension on the slideat relative humidity of less than 7%. The nuclei were then hybridised withthe MCB probe set for chromosome 5. With the help of a confocal laserscanning microscope (LSM 510 Zeiss) it was possible to deline the axesof both chromosomes to analyse their shapes and to localise the colouredchromosome sub regions. Human chromosomes 5 in interphase nuclei aresimilar to metaphase chromosomes. In many cases they are cylindricallyshaped almost as in three dimensionally intact metaphases. In contrast tometaphase chromosomes interphase chromosomes are always bent. Thecombination of both MCB and 3D analysis using confocal laser scanningmicroscopy seems to be a powerfully technical combination for functionalanalysis of the ultrastructure of interphase nuclei. ,2001
531,Psoriasis is a chronic disease of the skin characterized with silvery scalesdemercated and clear cut borders localized on ping red papuls or mac ules. Psoriasis affects about 2 percent of the population. The diseaseappears with the hyperproliferation of epidermal cells and inflammationresulting from infiltration of activated T helper cells and mononuclear cellsand release of pro inflamatory cytocines. In studies the psoriasis suscep tibility locus is restricted on a genomic sequence of 60 kb (6p21.3) on theHLA region. Recently genome wide scans have established the presenceof various gene localizations different from HLA and these are suggested to be responsible of psoriasis. But up to date only 1q 6p21 and 17q areconfirmed in various studies. In our study by using cytogenetic analysisand FISH with Cyclin D1 probe the 11q13 region that is one of the respon sible candidate regions is inspected to determine the possible chromoso mal disorders in peripheral blood samples of 31 patients. Additionally weevaluated the cases for the hereditary model of the disease. As the resultsof cytogenetic and FISH analyses the chromosomal structure and the11q13 region were determined to be normal in all of our patients. The pedi gree analysis of some cases suggested the mode of inheritance of the pso riasis as dominant as well. ,2001
532,Chromosome analyses have been performed in a sample of infertilitypatients. In the case reported a supernumerary marker chromosome wasfound by Q and G banding after lymphocyte culture. The male patientshowed no clinical abnormalities besides abnormal spermatogenesis/azoospermia/. The relatives in the ascending and collateral line of theindex patient were included in the cytogenetic investigation. Three of them all females were also carriers of the der(15). They showed neither anincreased abortion rate nor decreased fertility. Molecular analysis of theAZF gene in the index patient gave normal results. The marker chromo some was identified by FISH as a heterochromatic deviate of chromosome15. The role of heterochromatic marker chromosomes in male sterility willbe discussed.

533,Introduction Karyotyping involves a time consuming laborious process ofcell culture chromosomes preparation banding and staining. Documenta tion requires conventional photography based on 35 mm optical cameraand results are known only after development and printing. Commercialimaging karyotyping equipments are available which have simplified theanalysis but are beyond the reach of small laboratories. Here we would liketo share our experience of digital imaging using video camera. Aims Todemonstrate utility of digital imaging using simple video camera as ameans to document karyotype. Methods GTG banded metaphase chro mosomes prepared from peripheral blood of ten subjects were analyzedboth by conventional film photography and by images captured via CCDvideo camera. Multi frame analog videos of metaphases under simplemicroscope were recorded and digitized with the help of video capture cardusing PII computer. Individual frames were saved as BMP format and wereenhanced using MGI Photosuite software. Images were printed on pho toglossy paper using Canon inkjet printer. Karyotypes were prepared fromthe photographs of same metaphases. Results A total of 50 completemetaphases were examined. Average time consumption to printing andprint loss due to intermediate processes were 12 hours and 6% respec tively using conventional method as against 45 minutes and 2% respec tively using video digital method. The contrast between bands among indi vidual chromosomes was better with conventional method. However iden tification of chromosomes poses no problem with either modalities. Thecost involve in conventional printing was higher. Conclusion This innova tive video digital microphotography is less time consuming inexpensiveand reasonably cost effective and with some improvisation can producegood quality photographs. Further the technique makes storing andarchiving the images easier and can have wider applications in small labsin developing countries. ,2001
534,Objective To establish the existence of increasing risk for a chromosomeaberration in mothers with previous child with Down syndrome. From16604 prenatal cytogenetic investigations performed since 1978 until164 Posters: Cytogenetics1999 in our centre 831 pregnant women have had a previous fetus with Down syndrome. Routine chromosomal investigations in cultured amnioticfluid cells were performed according to well known standard procedures. Results 712 women were under the age of 35 and among them 5 (0.70%)had fetus with a chromosome aberration. Four cases (3.36%) of patholog ical karyotyp were found in a group of 119 patients over the age of 35. Con clusion The parents with a previous child with Down syndrome have anincreased risk for having a second affected child. Advanced maternal ageincrease the risk. ,2001
535,Chromosome heteromorphisms involving the pericentromeric region ofchromosome 9 have been associated to early recurrent abortions. Howev er results and opinions about the clinical significance of pericentric inver sions remain contradictory. We have performed cytogenetic analysis of120 unrelated couples who had presented two or more spontaneous abor tions due to indeterminate causes. The control group was made up of 384individuals. Chromosomal studies have included GTG CBG NOR andhigh resolution bandings. Ten couples (8.3%) presented a major chromo some aberration and 33 couples (27.5%) showed a polymorphic chromo some 9. Pericentric inversion involving the 9q region was detected in 9.1%of the couples and in 1.3% of the samples from the control group. This find ing was characterized by F. I.S. H. technique using CEP 9 alpha satellite(VYSIS) beta (D9Z5) and satellite III (D9Z1) DNA probes. In all cases thebreakpoints were located in euchromatic regions confirming the cytoge netic diagnosis. The origin was maternal in 80% of the cases. Frequenciesof individuals and of couples carrying inv(9) were compared to the fre quencies shown by the general population and to the frequencies reportedby 11 authors revealing a significant difference between observed andexpected ratios. Our results suggest a correlation between pericentricinversions of chromosome 9 and recurrent reproductive loss. ,2001
536,The present study included 2600 patients referred to our Department ofHuman Genetics National Research Center Giza through 8 years studyperiod. The main aim of the present study was to classify cases of birthdefects whether they are isolated or multiple to identify the genetic etiolo gy of cases and to evaluate the genetic versus environmental componentsof birth defects. Patients were subjected to complete clinical and geneicevaluation. Construction of special computer program for data registry andsearch was performed. Syndrome diagnosis and identification was carriedout by the use of special database programs. Our results showed that genetic syndromes were the most frequent group. Genetic etiologic classi fication of the studied cases showed that the monogenic group of disorderswas the most predominant group (53.1% of the studied cases) and auto somal recessive pattern of inheritance is the most frequent pattern of inher itance (34.2%). The effect of environment was detected in 3.7% of casesemphasizing a mild impact of environmental effect in our present study. Rate of consanguinity among the referred patients was 53.6% 71% werefirst cousins. Mental reardation represented 44.9% of all referred cases. Chromosomal breaks were the most predominant structural aberrations(26%) and were increased in the genetic syndromes indicating the use ofFISH to detect any cryptic aberrations. Our study supported the hypothe sis that consanguinty is an important risk factor in the causation of birthdefects environmental factors have a definite effect in the present studyand computer is an important tool in the diagnosis of genetic diseases. Weconcluded that the high incidence and recurrence risk of single genedefects in the present study indicates that there is a need to develop acomprehensive preventive program. This will form the basis of a commu nity based genetic service which is an integral part of preventive healthcare. ,2001
537,Queensland covers over 1.7 million square kilometres of the continent ofAustralia. The statewide genetics service Queensland Clinical GeneticsService (QCGS) is based in Brisbane where 44% of the state s populationlive. Outreach clinics are held in 9 other cities however for many ruralpatients attending these clinics often involves travelling large distances. Queensland Health has over 160 telemedicine sites to facilitate accessand support to rural patients and health practitioners. Mental health pae diatrics and intensive care are the main users of this technology howeverthe potential exists for expansion into other areas of medicine includinggenetics (telegenetics). In order to evaluate the effectiveness efficiencyand acceptability of telegenetics we have conducted a study comparingclinical telegenetics consultations with face to face consultations. Patientssuitable for inclusion in the study were invited to participate and sent infor mation a survey on pre clinic expectations and a consent form. Thosepatients consenting to participate were randomly allocated to either a tra ditional face to face clinic or to a telegenetics clinic. Post consultation thegeneticist and genetic counsellor involved completed a survey on their per ception on the clinical session. Four weeks after the consultation partici pants had telephone follow up by the project officer to complete a surveyexamining whether the patients needs were met by the consultation. At thetime of abstract submission 12 patients had entered the study. Early resultssuggest telegenetics has been a suitable method for service delivery froma patient and health professional perspective. ,2001

The total rate of abnormality amongst the mentally and devel opmentally delayed cases was 8% which is comparable to Similar studies. ,2001
540,A possible new immunodeficiency syndrome was reported in 1978. Themale patient had a transient block in the normal maturation of B cells andintractable diarrhoea and died at age 8 months. Three diseased brothersprobably had the same disorder. Their two sisters have since had two andone affected sons respectively. All seven affected boys were dystrophic atbirth. They were stillborn or died in early infancy except one boy who diedat age 5 years. This boy developed signs of hypohidrotic ectodermal dys plasia with thin hair small cone shaped teeth and oligodontia but with noperiorbital wrinkling. At age 8 months he started having serious pneumo coccal infections which were difficult to treat. He also developed an inflam matory bowel disease. All three obligate female carriers had small teethand reported lack of sweating. One carrier had a highly skewed X inacti vation whereas two carriers had a random X inactivation. Haplotype analy sis showed that both affected and unaffected family members sharedmarkers flanking the hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (ED1) gene. Affect ed members shared markers in the regions Xp21.1 p11.4 and Xq27 qtel. Anovel X linked disorder of immunodeficiency and hypohidrotic ectodermaldysplasia has been reported. This disorder is allelic to incontinentia pig menti and the patients had mutations in exon 10 of the IKK gamma(NEMO) gene. The findings in our family bear some similarity to this novelimmunodeficiency. However no mutations in exon 10 were found. Ourfamily may represent a mutation in other parts of the NEMO gene or yetanother X linked immunodeficiency syndrome. ,2001
541, luebeck.deCardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) leads to a systemicinflammatory response with cytokine secretion. Cytokine release meas urements during cardiac surgery with CPB showed a high inter individualvariability in cytokine secretion. We studied patients who underwent a car diac surgery with CPB. Previous results from our laboratory have showedthat the inter individual differences in IL 6 release were accompanied bydifferences in the release of other cytokines such as TNF A IL 1ÃÂ§ and sIL 2R. This phenomenon might in part be due to variations in individual genet ic true nature. Evidence for a relationship between genetic variations at theHLA and/or cytokine gene loci and the expression of cytokines have beenreported elsewhere. The regulation of the expression of some cytokines isin part genetically determined. To examine whether genetic backgroundmight play a role in affecting individual cytokine serum levels and influenc ing the degree of the inflammatory response during surgical trauma (e.g.cardiac surgery with CPB) we investigated the distribution of polymorphicelements within the promoter regions of the TNF A and IL 6 genes in oursamples and determined their genotype concerning the BAT2 geneinvolved in the HLA region. Our preliminary data suggest that the A alleleat 308 of the TNF A gene promoter region might be responsible for high er release of serum TNF A in patients undergoing cardiac surgery withCPB. Regulatory polymorphisms in or near the TNF locus i.e. allele set140/150 of the BAT2 microsatellite marker on the HLA region combinedwith the G allele at 308 of the TNF A gene might represent one con struction providing a genetic background for a less sensitive response tovarious stimuli. Further studies involving a larger sample size should bedone in order to confirm our preliminary results. ,2001
542,Carney complex is an autosomal dominant syndrome charecterized bylentigines myxomatous skin tumors and heart breast or endocrine tumors(primary nodular adrenocortical disease pituitary adenoma Sertoli celltumors). Myxomas are the main finding suggesting Carney complex how ever they can be mistaken as schwannomas and other bening or malignanttumors. Also the presence of lentigines and neurofibromas can be con fused with lesions of neurofibromatosis or LEOPARD. We report on a girlwith a lentiginous syndrome first evaluated at 6years/old due to the pres ence of pigmented spots on buttocks chin and legs. At age 9 years shedeveloped a mediastinal tumor which was surgically removed and diag nosed as lymphangio hemangio lipoma. On the clinical examination at thegenetic consultation she showed low nasal bridge hipertelorism hyper pigmented lip and sclera spots high arched palate low set ears. Her car diologic examination disclosed cardiomiopathy. At this moment she wasdiagnosed as having LEOPARD syndrome but later the cardiomiopathywas discarded. Four years later she had a neurilemoma on left hand anddeveloped hypothyroidism obesity an ovarian teratoma a pituitarymicroadenoma and tall stature. Theses features were all consistent withthe diagnosis of Carney complex. This case ilustrates the difficulties on theearly diagnosis of the disease mainly in casas without other affected fam ily members. In the present case the definitive diagnosis was reached onlyafter the apparition of important features such as the mediastinal lym phangio hemangio lipoma and the shwannoma of the hand. The histolog ic confirmation of the nature of these lesions proved to be an essentialdiagnostic tool. The genetic loci of carney complex were recently identifiedon chromosomes 2p16 and 17q2 therefore the molecular diagnosis canbe useful in cases like ours. ,2001
543,Pervasive development disorders (PDD) are a heterogeneous group ofneurobehavioral disorders of infancy. In order to identify etiologic factors ina sample of individuals with PDD a total of 103 subjects (84 males and 19females) referred for autistic behavior were submitted to a protocol includ ing clinical evaluation screening for inborn errors of metabolism karyotypein folic acid deficient medium and molecular test for the FRAXA mutation. Until now the following conditions were detected Down syndrome (n = 3) untreated phenylketonuria (n = 2) Rett syndrome (n = 2) tuberous sclero sis (n = 1) fragile X syndrome (n = 1) 5 other dysmorphic conditions 2non genetic etiologies and 2 individuals with chromosomal polymor phisms. Besides those 4 individuals presented no PDD and 3 individualshad infantile psychosis. These data suggest that in at least 15% of thissample a main etiologic factor could be identified. Although the diagnosisof a specific genetic condition do not modify the treatment of autistic indi viduals in most cases it is of significant importance to the genetic coun seling of their relatives. For this reason we reinforce the importance ofcareful dysmorphologic examination and complementary tests in any per son presenting with PDD besides neurologic and psychiatric evaluation. ,2001

545,Fetal Valproate syndrome (FVS) results from prenatal exposure to Valproicacid (VPA). It is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance a clusterof minor and major anomalies and central nervous system dysfunction. Inthis report two siblings who were exposed to monotherapy with VPA aredescribed with documentation of long term follow up. Both children hadcraniofacial findings multiple systemic and orthopedic abnormalities anovergrowth pattern and developmental deficits. In an effort to further delin eate the phenotypic features of FVS the literature from 1978 to 2000 isreviewed. A total of 70 cases that were solely exposed to VPA with ade quate phenotypic description were identified. Cases that did not have ade quate phenotypic description were excluded as well as cases that wereexposed to VPA and other anticonvulsant treatment The clinical manifes tations of FVS encompass a wide spectrum of abnormalities including con sistent facial phenotype multiple systemic and orthopedic involvement central nervous system dysfunction and altered physical growth. Thefacial appearance is characterized by a small broad nose small ears flatphiltrum a long upper lip with shallow philtrum and micro/retrognathia. Inthis review 62% of the patients had musculoskeletal abnormalities 30%had minor skin defects 26% had cardiovascular abnormalities 22% hadgenital abnormalities and 16% had pulmonary abnormalities. Less fre quently encountered abnormalities included brain eye kidney and hear ing defects. Neural tube defects were seen in 3% of the sample. Twelvepercent of affected children died in infancy and 30% of surviving patientshad developmental deficits/mental retardation. While 15% of patients hadgrowth retardation an overgrowth pattern was seen in 9%. The data fromthis comprehensive review especially the developmental outcome shouldbe added to the teratogenic risk which arises in association with the useof VPA during pregnancy. ,2001
546,The apparent declining rate of NTD affected births is being attributed toprenatal diagnosis and to folic acid (FA) use. The simultaneous initiation ofthese preventative programs makes it difficult to assess the impact ofeither intervention. We present results of a descriptive retrospective studyon the apparent incidence (stillbirths (SB) and livebirths (LB))of register able births (i.e. >20 weeks gestation) compared to the actual incidence(medical abortions (TAB) SB and LB) of NTD affected pregnancies. Weidentified 144 NTD affected fetuses/SB/LB born between 1997 and 1999.During this time period the apparent incidence of NTDs was 52/133 959 or0.39/1000. The actual incidence was 144/134 041 or 1.07/1000. FA sup plementation was used peri conceptionally in 38.7% (36/93) pregnancies. Affected pregnancies were prenatally diagnosed in 67% (96/144) with89% (85/96) of those diagnosed at <24 weeks and 84% (81/96) resultingin TAB. Severe associated anomalies were present in 31% (45/144) with9.5% (13/144) having chromosomal abnormalities and 15% (21/144) hav ing recognisable syndromes and MCA disorders. Family history of NTDswas reported in 12% (17/144). In conclusion TABs following routine pre natal diagnosis are a significant contributor to the declining incidence ofNTD affected births. FA use is rising and is contributing to the decline in theactual NTD incidence from 1/795 in 1958 84 to 1/930 in 1997 99 repre senting a 15% reduction. There may be a rising proportion of NTDs due to underlying chromosomal syndromic and genetic disorders unresponsiveto FA supplementation. ,2001
547,Background Male infertility is caused by many different exogenous andendogenous factors. Today screening for chromosomal aberrations anddeletions of Y chromosomal sequences belongs to the standard proce dures of andrology centers. We report on the largest cohort of infertilemales in Austria comparing clinical data with cytogenetic and molecularfindings. Methods Clinical examination seminal fluid and hormonal analy ses were carried out on 300 infertile males. Cytogenetic investigation wasperformed according standard methods (GTG banding). For fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH) we used Y alpha satellite (DYZ3) Y classicalsatellite (DYZ1) and Quint Essential Y probes. Molecular analysis we areroutinely screening for the presence of a total of 12Y chromosomal regions(centromer and AZF a c) by amplification using 3 multiplex PCR mixes andadditional Yq and/or Yp single PCR if necessary. Results Klinefelter Syn drome was the most frequent gonosomal anomaly (19 patients) followedby the mosaic karyotype 45 X/46 XY (15 patients). Structural aberrationsincluded 6 translocations (one involving the Y chromosome) 13 small dele tions and 9 larger deletions (AZFb and AZFc.). The most frequent smalldeletion concerned sY153 (8 patients) 4 larger deletions started withsY153. Discussion Klinefelter Syndrome 45 X/46 XY dysgenesis and XXmaleness are well known causes for infertility. Larger Y chromosome dele tions concerning AZFa AZFb and AZFc cause infertility with decreasingprobability. In small deletions the analysis of the paternal Y chromosomemay help to establish causal relationsship. Frequent polymorphisms maybe a reason for Y chromosome fragility as observed in our sY153 deletedpatients. ,2001
548,We report the cytogenetic and developmental findings in a 6 month oldAfrican American female infant who was evaluated for a stridorous cry anddysmorphic features at birth. The proposita was the product of a third preg nancy of an 18 year old woman and was delivered at 39 weeks gestationwith a birth weight of 2.29 kg. She presented with a stridorous hoarse cry poor suck tracheomalacia malrotation of the gut generalized hypotonia congenital heart disease and enlarged clitoris. She was at the 5th per centile for height and weight. Her head at the 50th percentile was dispro portionately large. Her anterior fontanelle was large full and extended tothe metopic suture which was gaping. The proposita had a prominent fore head and upward and outward slanting of the palpebral fissures. The nasalbridge was flattened and had a prominent crease. Her ears were slightlylow set large and prominent. Her fingers and toes were very elongated(arachnodactylic). Severe feeding difficulties required gavage feeding. G band chromosome studies showed an inverted duplication of most of theshort arm of chromosome 5 (46 XX inv dup (5)(p15.32p12). Maternal chro mosomes were normal the father was not available for study. Fluores cence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were performed to confirm thatthe extra material was derived from chromosome 5 and also to determineif the cri du chat critical region was deleted as a result of this structuralabnormality of 5p. Whole chromosome paint for chromosome 5 showedhybridization to the entire abnormal #5 confirming that the extra materialwas derived from 5. The EGR1 probe to the cri du chat critical region at5p15.2 showed one signal on the normal #5 as well as a double hybridiza tion signal in the middle of the short arm of the abnormal #5 chromosome indicating trisomy for this locus. The FISH result was consistent with the G band findings of an inverted duplication of 5p resulting in trisomy for mostof the short arm of chromosome 5. The cri du chat region was included inthe duplicated portion and therefore was trisomic not monosomic as inindividuals with cri du chat syndrome. Duplication of 5p is associated witha specific phenotype which is dependent upon the extent of the trisomicregion. Based on published reports we concluded that the proposita wason the severe end of the phenotypic spectrum for trisomy 5p syndromewhich is consistent with the cytogenetic finding that virtually all of her 5pwas trisomic. At followup it was evident that this infant had global devel opmental delays. Additional information on the natural history of this syn Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 167drome will be presented. ,2001
549,Ectrodactyly and its equivalents are relatively common in 4 deletion syn dromes del(2)(q31) del(4)(q33qter) del(6)(q21) and del (7)(q21.3). Mani festations of the defect may be different even in sibs with exactly the samedeletion. Nevertheless analysis of phenotypic picture may shed some lighton the hierarchy of the genes involved in the origin of ectrodactyly. Inthese patients defect of each extremity may be scored from 5 (maximaldefect with absence of the whole limb) to 1 (equivalent forms of ectro dactyly). Each person will be characterized by the sum of scores fordefects of both upper and (after colon) both lower limbs. In such a case itis possible to compare 1) severity of defects of the upper and lower limbsfor each type of deletion 2) general severity of limb defects in differentdeletions. The results of the analysis of the reported cases (after summa tion of all individual s scores) are shown in the Table. It can be seen that in persons with deletions of 2q31 upper and lower limbs are affected with the same severity. Deletion 6q21 affects mostly upperlimbs deletion of 7q21.3 affects mostly lower limbs. It can be presumed that a gene on 7q21.3 acts on later stages of embryogenesis than a geneon 6q21. Generally the most severe defects are found in del(2)(q31) thesmallest defects in del(6)(q21) and del (4)(q33qter). Therefore this formalanalysis can provide some information concerning hierarchy of the genes involved in development of ectrodactyly. ,2001
550,Phenotypic manifestations of structural autosomal imbalance (SAI) give aclue to the location of genes causing congenital malformations. Data onectrodactyly holoprosencephaly (HPE) and other defects confirmed thefruitfulness of this approach. A similar analysis was performed foresophageal atresia (EA) genes for which have not yet been mapped(except one gene on 2p23p24 [Celli et al. 2000]). EA is a rare manifesta tion of chromosomal defects. 27 cases of SAI with EA were found in the lit eratire. Deletions of 3 segments del(17)(q22q23) del(14)(q32.3qter) anddel(9)(p22pter) were associated with EA more than once. Most likely seg ments 17q22q23 and 14q32.3qter harbor genes responsible for EA. Therole of 9p22pter is questionable in both cases with EA monosomy 9p wasassociated with partial trisomies for another autosome but EA was notfound in any case of pure del(9p). Duplications of 3 other segments[dup(3)(p25p26) dup(5)(q34qter) and dup(18)(q12qter)] were associatedwith EA more than once. Minimal duplication 18q with EA was 18q12 qter that actually does not help to localize the gene responsible for this defect. Two of three persons with EA and dup(3)(p25p26) also had HPE. EA wasnot found in 16 other persons with dup(3p) and HPE and was found in oneof 76 persons with dup 3p without HPE. The most likely explanation in tri somy 3p HPE and EA may be different manifestations of the same tripli cated gene. 18 out 27 persons with EA and SAI also had congenital heartdefects 6 out 27 had anal atresia but not a single had diaphragmatic her nia. ,2001
551,During a period of 3 years from November 1997 to November 2000 a totalof 116 patients under the age of 25 with the diagnosis of aplastic anemiahave been referred to our center for chromosome breakage study to ruleout Fanconi anemia. Using Mitomycin C to induce chromosome breakage we found 57 positive cases this is indicative of a high frequency of thisdetrimental disease in Iran and we would directly attribute it to the high rateof consanguineous marriages in our country that is estimated to be as highas 30%. All patients but one were products of consanguineous marriages 5 had distant relative parents and all other parents were first cousins. On physical examination 2 patients (3.5%) were entirely normal 15 (26.3%)had only short stature and/or skin findings and other 40 patients (70.2%)showed at least one major abnormality. The breakage study in 3 patients(5.3%) revealed 2 cell populations one with normal and the other withincreased breakage rate. ,2001
552,Cases of ectrodactyly are usually sporadic but cases of autosomal inheri tance or demonstrating chromosomal rearrangements have also beendescribed. So far 4 different genes or regions for ectrodactyly have beenmapped on 7q21 Xq26 10q24 and 3q27. In addition deletions of 2q24 q31 and 6q16 q23 have been reported. We report a newborn girl demon strating ectrodactyly of hands and feet (aplasia or hypoplasia of II III fin gers and toes) heart defect hypoplasia of left ventricle interrupted aorta genital anomalies hypoplasia of labias and facial dysmorphic features down slanting palpebral fissures blepharophimosis upturned nose longphiltrum broad nasal tip retrognathia. Standard chromosome studies ofblood lymphocytes showed a pathological karyotype 46 XX add(21)(p11).Parental karyotypes were normal. Fluorescence in situ hybridization(FISH) revealed partial trisomy for 16q karyotype after FISH46 XX add(21).ish der(21)t(16 21)(q12 p11). There are some 20 casesabout the trisomy 16q reported so far but only one case with similar dupli cated region (trisomy 16q12.1 qter). To our knowledge the association ofectrodactyly and partial trisomy 16q has not been reported previously butsome cases demonstrated clinodactyly and flexion contractures. There fore our case suggests that possibly another gene(s) causing ectrodacty ly in a subset of patients maps on chromosome 16q12 qter. In contrast tothe other genes and regions for ectrodactyly identified so far this possiblegene(s) or region on 16q may be predicted to cause ectrodactyly by over expression (trisomy). ,2001
553,Background Male infertility is caused by many different exogenous andendogenous factors. Today screening for chromosomal aberrations anddeletions of Y chromosomal sequences belongs to the standard proce dures of andrology centers. We report on the largest cohort of infertilemales in Austria comparing clinical data with cytogenetic and molecularfindings. Methods Clinical examination seminal fluid and hormonal analy ses were carried out on 300 infertile males. Cytogenetic investigation wasperformed according standard methods (GTG banding).

So far 18 patientsfrom 9 families have been reported vast majority originating from theMediterranean region. Here we report on a Turkish family with four affect ed children. The proposita an 8 month old female was the eighth child ofsecond cousin parents. Physical examination showed oral cleft filiformand cutaneous bands between the jaws ankyloblefaron corneal ulcera tion syndactyly of fingers and toes popliteal pterygium and genital anom alies. Radiological studies revealed synostosis of phalanges of toes andfingers and mild pulmonary stenosis. Family history showed that threeprevious siblings were born with similar clinical features. Although the pre ceeding sibs had died in early days of life the index case survived until oneyear of age. ,2001
555, saude.ptBrachydactyly type B an autosomal dominant disorder is the most severeof the brachydactylies and is characterized by terminal reductions of thefingers and toes. We report the results of a clinical and radiological studyof a father and son affected with BDB. These two individuals demonstrat ed a severe phenotype Ã¢\x80\x94 bifid thumbs with split or rudimentary nails sev eral phalanges are entirely missing ( absence of medial and distal pha langes in digits 2 and 5 ) the 3rd L metacarpal is short with hypoplasia andsynostosis of medial and distal phalanges with camptodactyly and partialcutaneous syndactyly of digits 2 4 in the hands. The feet showed a broad1st metatarsus absent distal phalanges of digits 2 4 an additional trans verse phalanx forming an incomplete osseus bridge between digits 2 3 andcomplete cutaneous syndactyly of digits 2 4 in the feet. We designedprimers suitable for cDNA amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinasegene ROR2 and analysed the coding region by SSCP of restriction digest ed RT PCR products. Fragments showing SSCP changes were directlysequenced in the affected individuals which enabled us to find a het erozygous 1 bp delection (2249delG) which leads to a frameshift atGly750 with an arginine/ proline rich sequence of 23 novel amino acidsbefore the first stop codon. Allele specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridiza tion was used to confirm correct identification of the mutation and showedthat it arised de novo in the father as it was not present in either of his unaf fected parents. This report is the most severe hand phenotype associatedwith ROR2 mutation to date. ,2001
556,X linked Alport syndrome (ATS) is a semi dominant nephropathy due topoint mutation or less frequently to intragenic deletion of the COL4A5gene located in Xq22.3. We describe two families with ATS MR contiguousgene deletion syndrome in Xq22.3 characterized by Alport syndrome andmental retardation. The first family has a complex phenotype previouslyreported as AMME (Alport syndrome midface hypoplasia mental retarda tion and elliptocytosis) and a deletion extending about 2 Mb. The secondfamily was identified in the literature using nephropathy and mental retar dation as a query. This second family has a smaller deletion of about 1 Mb. A detailed characterization of both deletions and a comparison with a thirdlarge deletion causing only ATS identified the critical region for mentalretardation. Moreover detailed analysis of gene content has suggestedputative candidate genes for mental retardation as well as for additionalphenotypic features. The three carrier females belonging to the two fami lies showed ATS features only i.e. microhematuria suggesting that addi tional phenotypic features in affected males are X linked recessive. How ever X inactivation in the carrier females is completely skewed possiblydue to a selective mechanism. This peculiar finding opens the possibilitythat the mental retardation cardiopathy or elliptocytosis are caused bydominant mutations in one or more genes found in the ATS MR criticalregion. In conclusion we have demonstrated the existence of a new con tiguous gene syndrome in Xq22.3 which we propose to call ATS MR whichadds to the previously known ATS DL (Alport syndrome and diffuse leiomy omatosis). Both contiguous gene deletion syndromes involve COL4A5 butwhile ATS DL extends centromerically ATS MR extends telomerically withrespect to the collagen gene. Due to relative simplicity of identification ofthe second family just by screening the literature we suggest that this syn drome may be less rare than thought. Since ATS in children is confined tomicrohematuria this clinical sign may be missed or hidden by the moresevere phenotype such as mental retardation. We suggest that a relativesimple analysis such as urinalysis be used to screen males with MR ofunknown etiology. ,2001
557,Cleft palate without cleft lip is a causally heterogeneous condition. Thereare several reports in the literature of autosomal dominant inheritance ofcleft palate either in isolation or associated with other features. The com bination of cleft palate microstomia and micrognathia has been reportedpreviously by Bettex et al (1998) in association with oligodontia and normalintelligence. All the affected members of Bettex family who had karyotypesdone were demonstrated to have a fragile site at chromosome 16q22. Wereport a family in which four members in two generations have microsto mia micrognathia a partial or complete cleft of the hard palate and normalintelligence. All have been shown to have the fragile site at chromosome16q22 suggesting the possible presence of a closely linked gene in thisregion that is important in the development of the palate and lower face. ,2001
558,In 1964 Sotos et al described five children with large body size and earlyaccelerated growth acromegaloid features advanced bone age and anon progressive neurological disorder with mental retardation. Since thenmany cases have been reported of what is now known as the SOTOS syn drome or cerebral gigantism. Two case reports have suggested a possibleinvolvement of the region 3p21 one describing a 6 year old boy with clin ical features consistent with SOTOS syndrome and showing a balancedtranslocation t(3 6)(p21 p21) and one describing a nonsmoker female withSotos syndrome who at the age of 22 died of small cell lung cancer atumour characterized by deletions in 3p21. A precise determination of thebreakpoints of an EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell line from thepatient carrying the balanced translocation was obtained by fluorescent insitu hybridizations of YACs from the regions 3p21 3p25 and 6p21 p22 respectively. The chromosome 3 breakpoint appeared to be in band p22 and does not coincide with any of the regions of chromosome 3 suggest ed to be involved in tumour development. We established a PAC contig foreach of the breakpoint regions. Both contigs appear to contain expressedsequences. The precise position of these genes relative to the breakpoints in combination with expression studies in six SOTOS patient derived celllines may provide a first indication of a possible causative relationship withthe clinical features of the SOTOS syndrome in general.

559,Polymorphism at the glutatione S transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene locushave attracted much interest because the homozygous GSTM1 deletion(GSTM1 0/0) seems to modify the risk for severed types of diseases. Thefrequency of GSTM1 null genotype in 89 healthy individuals was 0 51. Forsearch of association between variants of clinical current of a surgicalinfection and GSTM1 polymorphism the study of frequencies of genotypesat the patients with sepsis (N = 31) septical shock (N = 46) and multipleorgan failure (N = 20) was carried out. The frequencies of GSTM1 nullgenotype in different groups varied from 37 76 % in septical patients toPosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 16965 29 % in septical shock patients and 54 23 % in patients with multiple organ failure. The data of this study demonstrate that observed differencesin distribution of GSTM1 allele frequencies between patients with multipleorgan failure and healthy individuals was not significantly (p>0 05). But thefrequency of the null genotype for GSTM1 was higher in septical shockpatients as compare to septical patients and healthy individuals. Ourresults demonstrate that the possibility of development of septical shock isincreased for individuals with GSTM1 null genotype. ,2001
560,Microcephaly and intracranial calcification with repeated normal TORCHconstitute the recognized diagnostic criteria of congenital intrauterineinfection like syndrome (Mckusick 251290) and Aicardi Gouti res syn drome (Mckusick 225750). It was reported that periventricular calcificationand abnormal EEG and / or seizures characterize the former while the lateris characterized by calcification of the basal ganglia dystonic movementsand chronic low grade CSF pleocytosis. The delineation between the twosyndromes is not clear because of the expanding phenotype spectrum andthe intrafamilial variability of Aicardi Gouti res syndrome and the lack ofdiagnostic test that could characterize the congenital intrauterine infection like syndrome. Here two Hungarian siblings with microcephaly encephalopathy hypotonia spastic tetraparesis generalized cerebraldemyelination and intracranial calcifications are described. The elder boyhad basal ganglia calcification while his younger brother had scatteredsupratentorial calcification and presented with abnormal eye movementsand dystonic movements in addition. The repeated TORCH and CSFexaminations showed normal results. The presented cases are more withthe diagnosis of Aicardi Gouti res syndrome however congenitalintrauterine infection like syndrome could not be excluded because of theabsence of the CSF pleocytosis and the clinical variability of the two cases. This report provides evidences that there is an overlap between the twosyndromes. Difficulties in making clear demarcation between the two syn dromes as well as wider differential diagnosis will be discussed. nan,2001
561, tours.fr3C syndrome is a rare MCA/MR syndrome considered as an autosomal recessive condition. It associates Dandy Walker malformation heartdefects and characteristic craniofacial features but ocular problems suchas coloboma and glaucoma are frequent. We report three foetuses fromthe same sibship two 27 weeks monozygotic twins and a 14 weeks foe tus who had malformations consistent with 3C syndrome. They all had aDandy Walker malformation. The twins had characteristic dysmorphic fea tures and unilateral microphthalmia with posterior coloboma. The first twinhad a very unusual atrial septal malformation and the third fÃ\x87tus had a pul monary valve anomaly. Chromosome analysis revealed a subtle balancedt(6 16) (p25.2 q23) translocation in the mother and showed that all threefoetuses had inherited the derivative 6 chromosome and were monosom ic for the 6p25.2 6pter region and trisomic for the 16q23 16qter region. Nochromosome abnormalities have been reported so far in 3C syndrome. However patients with terminal 6p deletion share many features with 3Csyndrome. They may have brain defects such as hydrocephaly Dandy Walker malformation or cerebellar hypoplasia cardiac malformations mostly septal defects and ocular abnormalities including glaucoma andcoloboma consistent with the effects of FKHL7 haploinsufficiency. More over the BMP6 gene is located in the 6p25 region and two 3C syndromepatients had anomalies of the sternum ossification a feature which is alsopresent in the BMP6 knock out mice. These observations suggest that 3Csyndrome could be caused in some cases by subtle chromosomal anom alies resulting in monosomy for the 6p terminal region. ,2001
562,Phenotype karyotype correlations in UTS are problematic prognosticcounseling may be difficult. Analysis of individuals with different X chromo some complements is confounded by overt or covert mosaicism. A propor tion (3 4%) of females with Turner syndrome are mosaic for a 47 XXX cellline either 45 X/47 XXX or 45 X/46 XX/47 XXX. 47 XXX alone is associat ed with a decrement in intellectual function normal stature and normalovarian function. The findings in 17/505 individuals in our UTS study clinicwho are mosaic for a 47 XXX cell line as well as 80 published case reportsare compared with those of 227 females in our clinic with 45 X alone. Shortstature is less common (48% compared with 73% in the 45 X group).Spontaneous menses (71% vs.10%) and fertility (40% vs. .05%) weremuch more likely in the mosaic women. A 46 XX cell line did not increasethe likelihood of menarche/fertility but did contribute to a greater likelihoodof normal stature compared with those with 45 X/47 XXX. Pregnancy out come was poor more than ? resulted in spontaneous loss. The risk forcardiac and renal malformations does not differ between the mosaic and45 X groups. Congenital edema found in 38% of 45 X individuals occurred in none with a 47 XXX cell line although nuchal webbing isequally prevalent in both. None of our 17 patients has intellectual dysfunc tion compared with 9% with 45 X. Although 21% of the women reported inthe literature are mentally retarded selection bias was present severalwere detected in screening of institutions or for a family history of MR. ,2001
563,The term pachygyria covers a heterogenous group of brain malformations. We report two siblings with a previously undescribed pattern of malforma tions including pachygyria seizures hypertrichosis dysmorphism micromelia hypoparathyroidism and early death. The proband is a onemonth old girl born to healthy unrelated Jewish parents. Before birth repet itive fetal mouth movements were noted indicating intrauterine fetalseizures and there was marked polyhydramnios. Head circumference atbirth was normal. Soon after birth she developed generalised convulsionsand apnea. Physical examination revealed multiple dysmorphic featuresincluding double eyebrows hypertrichosis short nose anteverted ears short neck micromelia left simian line bilateral clasp thumbs bilateralincreased distance between the first and the second toes edematous labiamajora and 11 pairs of ribs. Neurological examination revealed absence ofthe primitive reflexes. Metabolic studies were normal. The chromosomeswere normal as well as fluorescent in situ hybridization using a commer cially available probe for the Miller Dieker critical region at 17p13.3. MRIstudies revealed pachygyria and mild hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis.170 Posters: Clinical Genetics and DysmorphologyThe family s first child had the same clinical picture and was weaned off the respirator at the age of six weeks. At the age of three months she devel oped hypoparathyroidism. She died at the age of five months. CT revealedpachygyria with hypoplastic corpus callosum. The inheritance in this fami ly could be consistent with an autosomal recessive pattern. We suggestthat this combination of anomalies constitutes a unique syndrome. ,2001
564,Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by infantile hypotonia feed ing problems obesity small hands and feet hypogonadism and mentalretardation. Early diagnosis of PWS is important not only for the avoidanceof needless diagnostic procedures but also for the consideration of pre ventive and therapeutic options. However the presenting features of PWSevolve with time and are usually subtle in infancy making diagnosis diffi cult. In order to facilitate the diagnosis of PWS early in infancy we specif ically analyzed the clinical presentation of patients who were diagnosed atless than 1 year of age. From May 1 1999 to April 30 2000 71 cases ofsuspected PWS were collected. Methylation specific PCR was performedto amplify the CpG island of the SNRPN gene. Two sets of PCR primerswere used specifically for the methylated and unmethylated versions of theSNRPN gene. Of the 10 infants suspected of PWS 7 (70%) showed the174 bp maternal specific band only and proved to be PWS. The occur rence of the major consensus diagnostic criteria for PWS in the seveninfants were as follows neonatal and infantile hypotonia 7 patients(100%) feeding problems in infancy 6 patients (86%) excessive weightgain 0 patients (0%) characteristic facial features no less than 3 itemspresent in 2 patients (29%) hypogonadism 4 patients (57%) global devel opmental delay 3 patients (43%) hyperphagia 0 patients (0%). The aver age score according to major diagnostic criteria was 3. We conclude thatin infants with obscure characteristic features of PWS methylation specif ic PCR is a useful tool for the rapid screening of PWS. ,2001
565,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common autosomal dominant disorder of humans appearing in childhood. Features defining the diseaseare multiple cafe au lait spots multiple neurofibromas and Lisch nodules but other features such as short stature intellectual handicap central nervous tumors and other malignant diseases are also found. The geneNF1 was mapped to 17q11.2 and has been found to contain the mutationsin NF1 patients. The mutation rate in the NF1 gene is one of the highestknown for human genes with approximately 50% of all NF1 patients pre senting as sporadic cases. Molecular analysis and genetic counseling islimited to the identification of the specific mutation in each patient or fami ly or to the use of DNA polymorphisms and linkage analysis. We analyzed46 families with neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 was diagnosed clinicallyaccording to the NIH criteria. A positive family history was found in 47.8%(22 of 46) and 52.2% (24 of 46) of affected patients were considered to bethe result of a new mutation. DNA was obtained from peripheral blood ofpatients and related individuals. We used PCR RFLP and VNTR analysisfor linkage and LOH analysis in the affected families and individuals. Twen ty four families in the Croatia population with the de novo mutation werestudied using four intragenic markers. For VNTR analysis PCR productswere separated on polyacrylamide gels or were analyzed by submergedgel electrophoresis. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the affected individualrevealed a gross NF1 gene deletion in 3 (13.6%) families in 2 (67%) ofthem the deletion was maternally and in one (33%) paternally derived. ,2001
566,Jarcho Levin Syndrome (JLS Spondylothoracic dysplasia) is the severestform of vertebral malsegmentation syndromes with reduced stature result ing from axial skeleton. The main features are short immobile neck shortthorax with the patognomonic crab like rib cage associated with multiplevertebral defects and ribs that flare in a fan like pattern. The small size ofthe thorax in newborns frequently leads to respiratory problems and deathin infancy. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Carefully prenatal ultra sound examination during the second trimester should done for subse quent pregnancies. A clinically similar disorders is Spondylocostal dysos tosis (SCD). The main features are abnormalities of vertebral segmenta tion and of the ribs including multiple hemivertebrae vertebral clefting andfused hypoplastic vertebrae rib fusions and deletions with a non progres sive kyphoscoliosis. Survival is much better and neural tube defects onlyrarely occur. Both recessive and dominant autosomal inheritance has beenreported. Recently mutations in the recessive form were demonstrated inthe DLL3 gene mapped at 19q13. Segmental spinal dysgenesis is a rareanomaly where there is dysgenesis or agenesis of one or more vertebraeusually at or near the thoraco lumbar junction. We describe here fourcases of multiple vertebral segmentation defects two with the classicalfeatures of JLS and two other with SCD and a case with segmental spinaldysgenesis associated with tethered cord. Both young infants with JLS hadrespiratory problems with fan like deformities of the rib and one of thempresented also a thoracic meningomyelocele and club foot deformity. Theother two with the SCD both suffer from short neck and short trunk asso ciated with kyphoscoliosis without any significant respiratory restriction. Allpatients were sporadic and parental consanguinity were present only inone of them. We believe that appropriate classification of these similarphenotypes will improve molecular research and genetic counselling con cerning recurrence risk management prognosis and prenatal diagnosis. ,2001
567,We report on a male fetus with the lethal multiple pterygium syndrome(LMPS). The parents of the fetus were first cousins. Clinical features werehydrops a cystic hygroma colli facial dysmorphism cleft palate pterygia muscle hypoplasia joint contractures lung hypoplasia cardiac hypoplasiaand malrotation of the gut. LMPS is rare and although its pathogenesis isstill unknown the absence or important reduction of fetal movements andjugular lymphatic obstruction appear to play a major role in the develop ment of contractures webbing and facial features. LMPS was originallyclassified as an autosomal recessive trait. An excess of males in reportedcases with LMPS and families suggestive of X linked inheritance have ledto the conclusion that X linked recessive inheritance cannot be excludedin (isolated) male cases. Consanguinity between parents was reportedonly once in the literature. Our case is to our knowledge the second reportdescribing a fetus with LMPS and consanguineous parents and the firstreport of consanguineous caucasian parents. This finding supports auto somal recessive inheritance of LMPS. ,2001
568,Accurate information on the natural history of a clinical condition is of para mount importance to professionals the families and the patient. It is par ticularly so for WHS for which still little data are available in the literature. To help delineate more accurately the natural history of WHS and to obtainbetter information to answer parents questions in a clinical setting wewrote out an exaustive questionnaire dealing with all the possible clinicalmanifestations of the syndrome and with the psychosocial development. The questionnaires were sent to the families of children with WHS throughtheir national support groups in the USA and Italy nationwide. Of 200questionnaires sent out to USA families 28 came back filled out while ofthe 35 questionnaires sent out to Italian families 22 came back filled out. Overall there were data on 50 patients (34 females 16 males). 15 of thepatients had been followed up by us from 4 months to 17 years. 35 caseswere detected by standard cytogenetics other 14 required FISH while 1did not show a detectable molecular deletion within the WHSCR. Ourexperience with natural history greatly expands literature reports 48/50(96%) had a seizure disorder 21/50 (42%) underwent gastrostomy 26/50Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 171(52%) had heart lesions 18/50 (36%) had oral facial clefts 21/50 (42%) had hearing defects that were sensorineural in 5 (10%) 30/50 (60%) hadskeletal anomalies 27/50 (54%) had abnormal teething 13/50 (26%) hadgenitourinary tract defects. Of note only 32/50 (64%) had severe/profounddevelopmental retardation while retardation was moderate in 12/50 (24%) and mild in 6/50 (12%). This is different from the literature where it is con ventionally stated that severe mental deficiency is an hallmark of WHS. Moreover 9/50 (18%) patients were able to walk with support (betweenage 2 and 12 years) whereas 15/50 (30%) patients were able to walkunassisted (between age 15 months and 7 years). 6/50 (12%) patients alsoachieved sphincter control (by day). 11/50 (22%) patients were helpingwith food dressing and undressing themselves and doing householdtasks. 7/50 (14%) patients became self feeders between age 4 and 12years. The 34/50 (68%) patients receiving serial EEG studies showed fair ly distinctive abnormalities usually outlasting seizures. Although difficult tocontrol in early years seizures tend to disappear with age. No apparentcorrelation was found between size of deletion and phenotypic severity. Allthe patients have a characteristic facial appearance which is the mostimportant clinic diagnostic sign. A slow but constant progress in develop ment was observed in all cases during the follow up period. In conclusion our combined cases represent considerable experience providing newinformation on several aspects of this important deletion syndrome. ,2001
569, erlangen.deAblepharon macrostomia syndrome (AMS OMIM 200110) is a very rarecondition characterized by a distinctive pattern of facial anomalies mal formed genitalia webbed fingers and cutaneous abnormalities. Only 8case reports exist in the literature including one sib pair. AMS is listed asan autosomal recessive trait based on one report of apparent overlapbetween AMS and cryptophthalmos syndrome. A very recent report how ever suggested autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression. The gene locus is uncertain. We present a male newborn with typical fea tures of AMS severe deficiency of the anterior lamella of both eyelids anddefect of lashes fishlike mouth with shortened philtrum malformed nosewith hypoplastic alae and nares hypoplastic abnormal ears dry patchyskin webbed fingers and hypospadia. Additional findings not previouslymentioned in AMS were renal anomalies (unilateral hypoplasia and con tralateral pyelectasia) and cerebellar hypoplasia. By the age of one yeardevelopmental delay and microcephaly became evident. Karyotypingrevealed a de novo paracentric inversion in the long arm of chromosome4. Preliminary results of FISH analysis confirmed the inversion. Furtherinvestigations are under way. Our observation strongly suggests a local ization of the AMS gene within one of the breakpoint regions on 4q whichare currently under molecular cytogenetic investigation. The spectrum ofclinical features in AMS is extended to renal and cerebellar anomalies. However it cannot be excluded that more than a single gene is involved inour patient. The presumable causal relationship between AMS and the 4qinversion in our patient argues in favor of a dominant new mutation ratherthan a recessively inherited defect. ,2001
570,Analysis of VNTR polymorphism in intron 2 of the hSERT was analysed forallelic association in 160 patients in the age between 13 40 years with the2nd stage opiate drug addiction (ODA). The decreasing tendency (P=0 06)of the geterozygotes was determined in patients compare to the controlgroup first of all on the account of increasing of the fraction of the long (12 repeat) allele gomozygotes. The most frequent was genotype 12/12 (0 44) the second was geterozygotic genotype 10/12 (0 34) among all ODApatients. The opposite results were found in the control group thegeterozygotes 10/12 were in the prevalence (0 45) when 12/12 genotypefrequency was much lower (0 35). 10/10 9/10 9/12 genotypes frequencieswere practically equal in the both groups (for patients 0 21 0 00 0 01 forcontrol 0 17 0 01 0 02 accordingly). In the hSERT gene allelic allocationfrequencies any veracious differences were not found. The 12 repeatedallele in the patients and control samples (0 62 and 0 59 accordingly) wasthe most common. The shortest 9 repeated allele frequency was very lowin both patients (0 03) and control group (0 02). The 10 repeated allele in the patients and control samples (0 38 and 0 40 accordingly) was almostequal. Thus the results of analysis of VNTR in intron 2 of the hSERT showthat there is a 10/12 geterozygotes descent tendency in ODA patients com pare to the control group first of all on the account of the 12 repeat allelegomozygotes frequency rising. ,2001
571, heidelberg.deAlthough trisomy 16q was supposed to be mainly responsible for prenatallethality some liveborn patients with partial trisomy 16q of varying exten sion have been reported. The phenotype is characterized by facial dys morphism congenital heart defects urogenital abnormalities failure tothrive and early death. Houlston et al. (1994) suggested that duplication of16q22 qter is a critical region for the facial features seen in partial trisomy16q syndrome comprising a high forehead prominent metopic suture hypertelorism down slanting palpebral fissures small mandible and earanomalies. There is little information about phenotypic severity in patientswith small distal trisomic segments. To our best knowledge only threepatients have been reported with trisomy of 16q24 qter the most distalsegment in 16q. We present two brothers with partial trisomy 16q24 qterand partial monosomy 1q44 qter. The clinical phenotype varies but bothpatients exhibit facial features described in partial trisomy 16q syndrome. Because of clinical findings resembling Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (facialdysmorphism small stature hirsutism) in one of the two boys FISH inves tigation was performed. We used a probe corresponding to the 16p13.3region and a paint of 16q (reference). Therefor we happened to find thecryptic translocation of 16q on 1qter. The boys phenotypes show similari ties with partial trisomy 16q syndrome and less distinct symptoms of mono somy 1q44 qter and will be discussed in detail. We suggest that trisomy16q24 qter only may cause typical features of partial trisomy 16q syn drome. ,2001
572,A 15 year old man with severe mental retardation autism hyperactivityand language deficit was suspected to have X fragile syndrome. Thispatient and his family members were screened for FMR 1 gene mutationswith PCR technique and Southern blot hybridization using a FMR 1probe(pFxa1NHE ONCOR) . The PCR analysis failed to show any abnor mality of FMR 1 gene in all the subjects examined. The Southern Blotanalysis revealed the unusual presence of two alleles in a male patient anormal allele (2.8 Kb) and a methylated allele corresponding to the normalallele present in females. This methylated allele is 5.2 Kb in size due to thepresence of a methylated site resistant to EagI restriction. We thereforehypothesize that a mosaicism of FMR 1 normal/FMR 1 methylated genealleles may lead to the development of X Fragile syndrome in this malepatient. Examination of family members demonstrated the presence of twonormal alleles in the proband s mother and a mutated allele in his grand mother .These findings may represent an atypical predisposition to FMR 1methylation. Since the FMR 1 full mutated allele found in the grandmotherwas not transmitted to her daughter the proband s mother could inheritedthe normal X chromosome followed by a de novo methylation mutation ofFMR 1 in the proband. The Southern Blot hybridization analysis revealeda FMR 1 mosaicism in the presence of a negative PCR study. It is there fore mandatory to employ the hybridation technique in the setting of strongclinical suspicion of FRAXA alteration even when initial PCR screening isnegative. ,2001
573,The subtelomeric regions are often involved in chromosomal rearrange 172 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyments. They are gene rich and therefore rearrangements in these regions are more likely to have phenotypic consequences than rearrangements inother regions. The 41 subtelomeric regions were screened for rearrangements with fluo rescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Chromoprobe T Kit (Cytocell UK). Two groups of patients all with normal standard chromosome analysis were investigated One group consisted of 14 patients with autism andwith at least one other relative affected with autism. DNA analysis for frag ile X was normal in all and no subtelomeric rearrangements were found. The other group consisted of 41 patients with idiopathic MR and dysmor phic features or a family history of MR. In this group five subtelomericrearrangements were found A 1pter deletion resulting in a well characterized del(1)(p36.3) syndrome was found in a girl born 1999. She had MR growth retardation and dys morphism. In a girl born 1986 a deletion of 4p was found. Using the FISH probe forWolf syndrome confirmed del(4)(p16.3p16.3). The girl had MR epilepsy microcephaly and dysmorphism consistent with Wolf syndrome. A previously not described derivative chromosome 9 der(9)t(9 22)(q34.2q34.3 q13.2q13.3) was found in a girl born 1999. Shehad MR microcephaly an atrial septum defect and dysmorphism. Herfather had a cryptic balanced reciprocal t(9 22) translocation. A recently described polymorphism of 2q was found in two patients. In conclusion three out of 41 (7.3%) patients with idiopathic MR were foundto have subtelomeric rearrangements in concordance with the prevalence(5 10%) in previous studies. ,2001
574,Toriello Carey is a rare mutliple malformation/ mental retardation syndromecharacterised by dysmorphic features including telecanthus/hypertelorism short palpebral fissures small nose malformed ears and Pierre Robinsequence. Affected patients also show several midline field defects agen esis of the corpus callosum laringeal anomalies and congenital heartdefect. Brachydactyly hypotonia and developmental delay were present inmost reported cases . The autosomal recessive inheritance was proposed but recently X linked or sex influenced gene disorder was suspected. Wereport on three patients two of whom are sibs. Presented patients showclinical findings typical for this condition but also some additional traitsexpanding further the phenotypic spectrum. Affected brother and sister hadsevere clinical presentation with death in early infancy. The third patientwith milder phenotype also showed marked somatic and developmentaldelay. Specific malformation pattern observed in present patients and inthe previously reported cases suggests an early midline developmentalfiled disruption presumably caused by a developmental regulatory genemutation. ,2001
575,Isolated duplication of the proximal portion of chromosome 22q is extreme ly rare. A distinct phenotype has emerged for distal partial 22q trisomy ordistal 22q syndrome. However as very few cases of proximal duplication22q are reported there is no real consensus on the phenotype correlatedto this cytogenetic anomaly. We report a 13 year old boy referred with theclinical suspicion of Seckel syndrome. Pregnancy and delivery at 38 weeksof gestation were normal birth weight was 2 550 g (10th centile) lengthwas 50 cm (50th centile) and OFC was 33 cm (<10th centile). At birth ourpatient presented hypotonia respiratory distress cardiac murmur (smallVSD) microretrognathia and epicanthal folds. Initial routine chromosomeanalysis was reported as normal as did cerebral and abdominal US. Onradiograph of the chest the number of rib was normal. He sat at 14months crawled at 19 months and began walking at 2 ? years. Audiologi cal testing at 6 years was normal. At 13 years he presented with a historyof severe mental retardation absence of speech and lack of daily livingskills hyperactivity postnatal microcephaly (OFC 49.5 cm <3rd centile)and short stature (142 cm 3rd centile) and dysmorphism. The physicalfindings included short and narrow forehead low posterior hairline down slanting palpebral fissures epicanthic folds strabismus beaked nose microretrognathia high vaulted palate dental malpositions 5th finger clin odactyly and sandle gap between toes I and II. The patient didn t meet theclinical criteria for Seckel syndrome and a new cytogenetic study showedadditional material on 22q. FISH analysis revealed a de novo 22q11.23 q13.2 duplication. Phenocopy of Seckel syndrome could be due to 22qduplication and high quality cytogenetic work up is recommended. ,2001
576,ABSTRACT Since today more than 960 mutations and 200 polymor physms in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene(CFTR) have been reported. In the population of cystic fibrosis patientsfrom Croatia delF508 is the most common mutation (70%) followed byG542X (5.4%) N1303K (3.6%) R117H (1.8%) 1717 1G>A (1.8%) andR1162X (1.8%). In our regular diagnostic procedure we have recentlyfound for the first time the case of the 621+1G>T splice mutation placedin the intron 4. Its incidence is 0.5% for South European countries. Ourusual laboratory procedure for detection of 15 in Europe most common CF mutations includes PCR reaction followed by either heteroduplex orrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. In a case of621+1G>T mutation (RFLP MseI restriction enzyme) mutated alleleappeared as three bands sizes of 234 142 and 54 bp. Considering that of15 mutations for which we usually test the samples only 6 have beendetected so far the appearance of in Croatian population novel 621+1G>T mutation confirms our strategy and the necessity for testing thelarge number of mutations. ,2001
577,In this report we have described an affected sib in a large consanguineousTurkish family who appears to have a new distinct dominantly inheritedblindness scoliosis and arachnodactyly syndrome. The proband is a 16years old boy. The parents also had another 2 affected sibs with similarclinical features. The father also has blindness thoracic scoliosis andarachnodactyly. On admission the proband was 153 cm height with 76 cmupper segment and 156 cm length of two arms. There was arachnodacty ly at both fingers and toes. Forth and fifth toes bilaterally were situated inback position. He has been suffered from progressive vision lost and stra bismus since his 8 years age. Clinical examination of the eyes showedhypermetropia and microcornea bilateral lens luxation to the degeneratedvitreous. There were atrophy of retinal elements and hypertrophy of retinalpigment epithelium. In the family all affected individuals have blindnessand scoliosis with variable degree as well as arachnodactyly. Biochemicalanalysis of all family members were normal. All skeletal survey was con sistent with the clinical findings. Urine analysis of the family foraminoaciduria and other routines were normal. Our recent review of the lit erature the London Dysmorphology Database (Winter and Baraitser 1993) did not show up any other known syndrome equally or approximatelymatching the blindness scoliosis and arachnodactyly syndrome proposedby this report. ,2001
578,The incidence of DiGeorge syndrome is estimated as 1 4000. Most casesare sporadic only about 4 10% of all cases are familiar. We present afamiliar case of 22q11.2 microdeletion with fenotypic differences. We haveinvestigated monozygotic twins from the second pregnancy of 32 years oldmother. From the first pregnancy a girl was born and died at the age of 16days due to congenital heart (conotruncal) defect. A fenotypical stigmati sation and also anal atresia were present. Twin A despite of her sister Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 173stigmatisation for DiGeorge syndrome not so typical heart anomaly ( sub arterial ventricular septal defect FOA a.lusoria dx.) and thymic hypopla sia. 22q11.2 mocrodeletion was also confirmed. Twin B typical DiGeorgesyndrome fenotype conotruncal heart anomaly and 22q11.2 mikrodeletionwas confirmed. Mother of the babies had typical DiGeorge syndrome stig matisation and mental defect 22q11.2 microdeletion was confirmed too. There is a suspect that the first child had the same finding. ,2001
579,Introduction Symphalangism Brachydactyly S. (Multiple Synostoses withBrachydactyly WL S. Hermann s Deafness Symphalangism Facio Audio Symphalangism S. 186500 MIM) is a rare entity and diversenames reflect the uncertainty in the definition of the syndrome. Objective Correlation of 11 personally examined cases with data obtained fromreview. Material and method Our clinical genetic study comprises 11cases examined in a family where the disease has been present for thelast 5 generations. Results The cases offer a complete and well definedclinical picture of a rare syndrome that has as definitory elements brachy dactyly + symphalangism + progressive deafness + autosomal dominantmode of inheritance. They are surprisingly similar in what the extension offinger morpholesions is concerned but different in what the onset age andthe deafness degree are concerned. Conclusions As the largest and mostcomplete series communicated authors propose a definition of the syn drome as Brachydactyly Symphalangism Deafness syndrome (BSD Syn drome) in order to avoid confusion. ,2001
580,Proteus syndrome is a complex disorder with malformations and over growth of multiple tissues in a mosaic manner. Clinical findings are veryvariable and the presence of subcutaneous lipomas lymphangiomas orhemangiomas is common. However abdominal lipomatosis is very rare. We report one black 2 year old girl with abdominal lipomatosis and isolat ed macrodactily. She was born from unrelated parents with normal birth weight and length in good conditions. Since four months of age she pre sented failure to thrive with progressive abdominal protusion and severemal nutrition. Macrodactily of the right middle finger and left preauriculartag were noted. Plantar surfaces of the feet were normal. Mental develop ment was normal. Abdominal ultrasound and CT showed large lipomatosiswith displacement of the bowel to midline. Laparotomy at age 2y2modetected giant lipomatous mass involving greater omentum and meso colon. The large lipomatosis resected weighted 2950g and was constitutedby normal mature adipocytes. Abdominal pelvic and other visceral lipo matosis were reported in Proteus and Bannayan Zonana syndrome rais ing some diagnostic difficulties between them. As recurrent abdominallipomatosis is already reported after a surgical resection a follow up isrequired. ,2001
581,Bardet Biedl Syndrome is characterized with polydactyly pigmentaryretinopathy obesity mental retardation hypogenitalism and renal abnor malities. Herein we describe a patient with the classical findings of Bardet Biedl syndrome associated with pancytopenia. The patient a 43 year oldwoman had been referred to our hospital due to pancytopenia. Her histo ry included obesity beginning in early childhood blindness and polydacty ly which had been corrected surgically. Physical examination revealedtruncal obesity and small short hands and feet. Her height was 151 cm.and weight was 80kg . There were scars in the hands and feet due to the surgical operation performed in the past for the correction of polydactyly. An ophtalmological examination revealed pigmentary retinopathy and sub capsular cataracts. Abdominal ultrasonography showed fetal lobulation inthe kidneys. A complete blood count showed pancytopenia The leukocytecount was 3300/mm3 the haemotocrite was %33.5 and the platelet countwas 126000/mm3. Bone marrow biopsy revealed dysplastyc erythtroidcells. Further laboratory investigation in regard to the other causes of pan cytopenia (Anti ds DNA blood B12 and folate levels hemosiderinuria)gave negative results. In haemotological consultation it was recommend ed that the patient should be followed for a possible development ofmyelodysplastic syndrome. The clinical and laboratory features of thispatient are compatible with a diagnosis of Bardet Biedl. However to ourknowledge coexistance of pancytopenia associated with Bardet Biedl syn drome has not been reported before. ,2001
582,We present a case of a boy with small growth with the finding of chromo somal aberation. We have investigated 8 5 years old boy which was ref fered to our department by the endocrinologist with the suspection of Noo nan syndrome. Fenotype height before 3rd percentile disproporcionalstature stigmatisation typical for Noonan syndrome delayed bone age. The parents and the sister of the proband have also their height below 3rdpercentile but their stature is proporcional they all have normal fenotype. Cytogenetic investigation of the proband 46 XY t(2 12)(q37 q24). Thesame translocation was confirmed in the probandÃÂ«s father. A gene for Noo nan syndrome is located in the 12q22 qter region. The translocation is inthe critical region of the gene for Noonan syndrome. We assume that thetranslocation may be the cause of a mutation in the gene for the Noonansyndrome. DNA analysis of the critical region is further proceeding in col laboration with the Institute of Medical Genetics University Hospital Dres den (Dr. med. Bartsch). ,2001
583,Puberty is characterised by rapid growth of long bones opened epiphyses increased traction on muscles insertion sites. All these contribute to thefact that during this developmental stage an increase in the incidence oforthopaedic problems and of medical conduct is noticed. Osteochon drodysplasias are part of this context. The objective of this work is to iden tify particular aspects of osteochondral dysplasias during puberty. In orderto achieve this purpose we have been studying 40 cases of osteochon drodysplasias representing 1.45% of the 2749 cases of genetic diseasesand congenital malformations in the evidence of the Genetics Departmentof the Clinical Hospital for Children Oradea. The incidence is 2.84 in10000 new borns. Osteochondrodysplasias represent 47% of the totalnumber of children with growth retardation at the age of puberty. The studycomprises cases of Achondroplasia Cleido cranial Dysplasia Marfan Syn drome McCune Albright Fibrous Dysplasia Mucopolysaccharidoses Osteogenesis Imperfecta Multiple Exostoses Syndrome Multiple Sym phalangism Ellis van Creveld Syndrome. Diagnostic evolutive therapeu tic psychological and socio professional aspects were taken into account. Conclusions refer to the necessity of a particular attention that osteochon drodysplasias cases that reached the age of puberty need in an interdis ciplinary manner including the collaboration of paediatricians orthopaedists geneticians medical recovery services sociologists psy chologists and teachers. ,2001
584,174 Posters: Clinical Genetics and DysmorphologyDiagnosis of a dysmorphic syndrome depends both upon the ability to recognise an abnormal appearing face and to match that face to a knownpattern of abnormalities. This requires recognition skills and a good visualmemory often augmented by visual catalogues. Less than half of the dys morphic patients presenting to our clinic will receive a diagnosis We areinvestigating the possibility of using three dimensional information to assistwith diagnosis of dysmorphic features. Six cameras erected on a steelframe are calibrated using a surveyed calibration frame. Six overlappingimages of each face are obtained so that 30 previously marked facial land marks are visualised by at least two cameras. The x y and z coordinatesof each point can then be deduced by trigonometry. Images are translatedto a common origin and rotated to a common plane (to ensure similar ori entation). Measurements are expressed in units of standard deviationsform an age appropriate norm. Distances between the landmarks can becomputed and compared. We have imaged 160 faces including three twogeneration families and patients with the dysmorphic syndromes. Wefound that variation between landmark positions is less between siblings inthe same family irrespective of sex when compared with children of thesame age who were unrelated. Syndrome affected patients show less left right facial asymmetry compared to normal children. Patients with thesame syndrome (unrelated) showed no statistically significant difference inlandmark position compared to normal subjects however they show avariation in distances similar to siblings. This suggests that the resem blance between faces of patients with the same dysmorphic syndrome isas close as the resemblance between siblings. We are exploring moresophisticated shape analysis using three dimensional analysis models andobtaining more images of children affected with the same syndrome. ,2001
585,Aim Introduce international standards for monitoring diagnosis treatment prevention and coding of BD. Method USAID funds provided for the cre ation of BD Centers in two regions of Ukraine (Rivne and Volyn bothimpacted by the Chornobyl disaster). Both BD Centers were provided with Web Internet information resources. In January 2000 population based BD Surveillance applying international standards began. Digital cameraswere provided to neonatologists to enhance BD ascertainment and to med ical geneticists to enhance clinical diagnosis care prevention and coding. Illustrated clinical histories are shared on an on going basis with Ukrainianand international experts. Results Tele consultations and use of electron ic information have attracted contributions by national and internationalexperts toward the care and prevention of BD in relatively remote areas ofUkraine. BD Centers have attracted students interns neonatologists obstetricians other clinicians as well as parents and support groups seek ing Web Internet access to information resources. Conclusions Imple mentation of Web Internet strategies in rural areas of Ukraine are keyelements that upgrade BD diagnosis care and prevention. ,2001
586,The triphalangeal thumb brachyectrodactyly syndrome is a very uncom mon autosomal dominant limb malformation in which polydactyly andtriphalangeal thumb(duplication anomalies) coexist with ectrodactyly andsyndactyly (absence malformations). To our knowledge four familial andtwo sporadic cases have been described and interestingly three of thesefamilies were of Mexican origin reflecting a geographic distribution of the disease. To date no molecular defects have been identified as the causeof the disease. Induced disruption of the homeotic gene HOXD 13 gene inmice produce a malformative pattern characterized by reduction of thelegth of some bony elements loss of phalanges bone fusions and thepresence of an extra element (duplication and absence anomalies). As thisphenotype is strikingly similar to that seen in the triphalangeal thumb brachyectrodactyly syndrome we decided to carry out molecular analysisof the HOXD13 gene (located in 2q31) in three affected members of a Mex ican family with the triphalangeal thumb brachyectrodactyly malformation. We perform PCR amplification of the complete coding region of HOXD13and automated sequence analysis of PCR products. After sequencing thetwo exons and the intron/exon boundaries of HOXD13 we were not able todetect any deletereous mutation in these subjects. A previously unidenti fied silent polymorphism was observed at nucleotide position 291 in exon1(GCA to GCG) without changing the encoded alanine. Our data excludesthat mutations in the coding region of HOXD13 are the cause of the tripha langeal thumb brachyectrodactyly syndrome. ,2001
587,The majority of men with cystic fibrosis (CF) are infertile due to a bilateralcongenital absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). However clinicallyaffected CF patients present a spectrum of genital phenotypes rangingfrom normal fertility to severely impaired speramogenesis and CBAVD. Inmen with isolated CBAVD with none of the clinical symptoms of CF anincreased frequency of CFTR mutations was found. The present study wasundertaken to test whether CFTR gene may be involved in male infertilitycaused by reduced sperm quality. We analyzed 21 infertile men withoutsymptoms of CF for the presence of mutations and polymorphisms within17 exons (and flanking sequences) of CFTR gene. One of 11 men withinfertility due to oligospermia or non obstructive azoospermia and 5 of 10men with obstructive azoospermia had at least one mutation in CFTR gene deltaF508 (one male with obstructive azoospermia was a compound het erozygote deltaF508 / 711+3 A G). Three men with obstructive azoosper mia and 2 with oligospermia or non obstructive azoospermia had 5T allelein Tn polymorphic site on one chromosome. Haplotype analysis of(TG)m/Tn polymorphic loci reveald (TG)11/7T haplotype as the most fre quent one in both groups of patients. Because the frequency of mutationsin our sample of infertile males (16.7%) was significantly higher(P=0.00138) than the expected mutation frequency in general population(2%) it seems likely that CFTR gene is associated with infertility due toreduced sperm quality in some cases. In the group of men with obstructiveazoospermia the frequency of mutations was higher compaired to thegroup of men with oligospermia or non obstructive azoospermia suggest ing that involvement of CFTR gene is much stronger in aetiology ofobstructive azoospermia than its participation in the process of spermto genesis or sperm maturation. The results of this study are also relevantwith regard to genetic counseling of couples treated by artificial reproduc tive technology the high incidence of CFTR mutations in men withobstructive azoospermia implies that they bear an increased risk for CF off spring and molecular genetic analysis of the CFTR gene are indicated inthese couples. ,2001
588,USAID funding prompted the creation of two BD Centers with BD Monitor ing in two regions in Ukraine impacted by the Chornobyl disaster. Scarcityof Medical Geneticists prompted charging neonatologists with the task toascertain BD s while the geneticists categorize manage and formulateprevention strategies. In January 2000 eighty neonatologists began BDpopulation based surveillance in Rivne and Volyn regions. Clinical data isillustrated by digital images. The BD focused activities by neonatologistssoon prompted provincial health authorities to expand the BD registry toinclude all neonates. In addition the health authorities are sponsoring agrowing number of inter disciplinary activities to further integrate obstet rics perinatology neonatology pediatrics pathology and other disciplinesthat impact pregnancy outcomes and the prevention of birth defects. Con clusion One key element of Ukrainian US BD Centers and surveillance isthe role played by neonatologists who have introduced medical genetics teratology and BD prevention strategies to relatively remote areas ofUkraine. Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 175P0388. Sibs with Dyggve Melchior Clausen syndrome Clini cal presentation and review of the literature B. Lemcke M. Herrmann J. Horst I. Kennerknecht Institute of Human Genetics M nster Germanylemcke@uni muenster.deDyggve Melchior Clausen syndrome (DMC) is a rare genetic condition withshort trunk dwarfism skeletal dysplasia and in part of cases associatedwith mental retardation. During pregnancy and at birth there are no grossabnormalities. In infancy and by early adulthood the dysmorphic signsbecome evident. Diagnostic criteria are often hypoplasia of the odontoidprocess platyspondyly lace like appearance of the iliac crests dysplasticheads of the humeri and femora subluxation of shoulder and hip joints irregularities of carpal bones. Involvement of the limb bones is predomi nantly proximal. Clinically a waddling gait disproportionate dwarfism rhi zomelic shortening of limbs prominent jaw scoliosis sternal prominence genua valga and clawing of fingers can be observed. Cytogenetic anom alies were excluded. Here we report on two families of German and Lebanese origin respec tively with one son and one daughter both affected with DMC. All probandsdeveloped a disproportionate dwarfism severe mental retardation andspeech delay. The faces became a coarse expression. Severe scoliosisand genua valga occured. After exclusion of keratan sulfaturia the differential diagnosis ofmucopolysaccharidosis type IV (Morquio) could be rejected. In additionrestricted joint mobility and mental retardation of the probands is not com patible with the Morquio condition. A spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia is clin ically similar but could be dismissed by radiological examination. X ray withpredominantly proximal dysplasia of epiphyses and metaphyses is typicaland especially lace like appearance of the iliac crests is pathognomonic. Those patients with DMC and regular mental development are proposedby several authors to be classified as Smith McCort dysplasia suggestinga heterogeneity of DMC. Pictures of the affected individuals and a litera ture review are presented. ,2001
589,MODY represents a specific form of non insulin dependent diabetes melli tus. The disease is characterised by an early onset before the age of 25years and by autosomal dominant inheritance. Its classification into 5 sub types is based on gene mutation. Our patient is a young woman treated fordiabetes mellitus since her 15th year. She has no family history for dia betes mellitus. The chromosomal analysis revealed an apparently bal anced translocation between 7p and 19q. The break on 7p15 is consideredto be the locus for glucokinase gene. The both parents have a normal kary otype. Mutations in the glucokinase gene cause diabetes in kindreds withMODY 2. There are some hypotheses to explain why patient with appar ently balanced translocation have abnormal phenotype gene disruption position effect submicroscopic deletion. Each of them can cause the glu cokinase deficiency. The molecular genetic analysis is carried out to con firm the origin of MODY 2 in our patient. ,2001
590,Myotonic dystrophy (MD) is the most common type of muscular dystrophyin adults. It s inheritance is complex since the genetic defect causing it is aunstable mutation due to the expansion of the triplet CTG at the DMPKgene on chromosome 19. The objective of this work was to achieve molec ular diagnosis of the disease in order to improve the clinical managementand the genetic counseling offered to patients and their families. Two tech nical diagnostic procedures were used Southern blot (using the p5B1.4probe after DNA digestion with EcoRI and BgII enzymes) and PCR. Fiftyfamilies have been localized dispersed in the whole country 84 of theirmembers have been studied at the molecular level obtaining the followingresults 21 asyntomatic individuals without the mutation four asyntomaticmembers carriers of the mutation among the syntomatic ones 30 have themutation and the others 29 belong a patients and relatives with DM likesymptons and do not have the mutation. The size of the mutation is posi tively correlated with severity of the symptoms and is negatively correlatedwith the onset age. Considering the inter generational behavior of the mutation Costa Rica shows no difference compared to the rest of theworld. MD is a disease of importance at the national level. ,2001
591,We report a family with two girls identical twins living in Ufa (Bashkor tostan Russia). They were born from the first pregnancy in a young non consanguineous married couple (both 22 years old). The girls developednormally until 18 months when the parents noticed difficulties in walkingand both twins started to complain of fatigue. From the age of 2 years theywere unable to run. The disorder is progressing slowly. Contractures of theelbows were first noticed at the age of 4. The limbs deformities and apathognomonic posture with flexion of the elbows scapular winging mildequinovarus deformities at the ankles limitation of the neck flexion due tothe contracture of the posterior cervical muscles and slight lumbar hyper lordosis are seen in both twins. The girls have muscle weakness mainly ofhumeral and peroneal muscles with pelvic girdle involvement and tendonareflexia slight elevation of muscle enzymes (2.5 times for CK) and EMGevidence of myopathy. They present with waddling gait difficulty climbingstairs and in walking on toes and they can t walk on their heels. No facialweakness calf hypertrophy mental and cardiac disturbances werenoticed. We also observed slight difficulty in walking on her heels limita tion of dorsiflexion of feet and mild weakness of the limb girdle muscles inthe mother of these girls. This case is a presentation of a rare condition ofautosomal dominant form of Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. The DNAstudies for a mutation of the lamin A/C gene (1q11 q23) are in progress. ,2001
592,Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X linked lethal myopathywith an incidence of approximately 1 in 3500 male births. The primary bio chemical defect in DMD is dystrophin deficiency. The dystrophin gene which spans approximately 2.4Mb of Xp has a high mutation rate. About60% of DMD patients has a deletion mutation and 10% has duplicationmutation. Remaining one third of patients with DMD have no grossrearrangements in the dystrophin gene identifiable by Southern blot analy sis or multiplex PCR. These Southern negative cases presumably resultedfrom small mutations that cannot be detected by current diagnostic screen ing strategies. We sequenced dystrophin coding region for small mutationsin 50 Southern negative DMD patients by using reverse transcription PCRand direct sequencing and identified 40 nonsense mutations or small dele tions/insertions and 3 one exon skippings all of which were unique to sin gle patients. There was no clustering of small mutations similar to the dele tion/ duplication distribution and no characteristic phenotypes for smallmutations were observed. As a consequence of detecting small mutationsin the coding region of dystrophin in 86% of DMD patients without dele tions/duplications we believe that reverse transcription nested PCR anddirect sequencing is effective to screen for small mutations in dystrophingene. ,2001
593,Introduction Anorectal malformations include stenosis atresia and ecta sia. They occur with a frequency of approximate 1 5000 newborns. Theyoccur isolated or associated in different syndromes. At least 35 dysmorphicsyndromes that associate ano rectal malformations have already beendescribed. Etiology may be genetic (mendelian or chromosomal) or non genetic. Study group and methods The 11 cases of anorectal malforma tions that were admitted to the Clinical Children Hospital of Oradea duringthe last 20 years (1980 1999) have been studied clinically in a retrospec tive manner. Results The frequency of anorectal malformations for Bihorcounty is estimated at 1 10000 new borns. 60% of them were isolated176 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyanomalies whereas 40% of them were associated in syndromes or by chance. A rare case of Townes Brocks syndrome that associates analimperforation polydactyly and polyotia is discussed in detail. Particulargenetical and clinical characteristics of these anomalies are also dis cussed. Conclusions The relatively rare anorectal malformations give riseto particular problems of genetical and clinical diagnosis and of geneticcounselling. ,2001
594,Intrachromosomal triplications producing partial tetrasomies are rare. Atleast 13 patients have been reported so far. Most cases involved chromo some 15q but triplications of 2q 5p 7p and 13q have also been described. We report here the first case of an inverted triplication of 3q. The proposi ta was born at term birth weight 3175 g length 45 cm. Clinical examina tion on her 1st day of life showed disproportionate short stature with shortlimbs generalized hirsutism peculiar face synophrys small upturnednose micrognathia low set malformed ears short and webbed neck postaxial polydactyly of left hand and omphalocele. Additional findingsincluded hydrocephalus Dandy Walker malformation spina bifida cardiacanomaly (ventricular septal defect) and multiple renal cysts. Standardchromosome analysis from peripheral blood lymphocytes showed cytoge netic mosaicism with an abnormal chromosome 3 (45%) and normal cells(55%). The abnormal chromosome 3q was initially interpreted as a dupli cation of 3q21 q29 but fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealedan inverted triplication of distal 3q / karyotype 46 XX trip(3)(q25.3q29)[27]/46 XX [32]. Parental karyotypes were normal. Partial duplications of chro mosome 3q have been reported previously. Interestingly a form of theBrachmann de Lange syndrome has been described with duplicationsincluding the 3q26.3 q27 region in several cases. Our patient demon strates similar facial features and malformations and a triplication of3q25.3 q29 (mosaicism). Reddy and Logan (2000) recently concluded thattriplications can be mistaken for duplications and therefore in assessingduplications recommended confirmation by FISH. Our case supports theirsuggestion. ,2001
595,In any patient who presents with muscle wasting and weakness for noapparent cause and in whom there is no involvement of the central orperipheral nervous system the possibility of muscular dystrophy should beentertained. The Clinical Children Hospital Oradea serves the populationof Bihor county. Our study covers a period of 20 years (1977 1997). In thisperiod we recorded nine clinical observations of Duchenne muscular dys trophy which represent an incidence of 1 9700 live born male. Annual dis tribution of the incidence is unequal and there are no geographical partic ularities. However the study revealed two affected brothers descendentfrom parents living in a special social and cultural environment resemblinga genetic isolate. Among the clinical manifestations cardiomyopathy wasa constant feature in four cases which evolved with progressive and severeintractable congestive heart failure to death. The two brothers died at 10and 13 years respectively the interval between the two deaths being twomonths. It was obvious that the fatal outcome of the brother had a profoundemotional influence on the other child who had previous psychologicaldepression which accompanies the disease. ,2001
596, heidelberg.deThe generic term median facial dysplasia (MFD) describes a subgroup ofpatients with cleft lip and palate exhibiting characteristic craniofacialdefects (1) short prolabium (2) absence of frenulum labii (3) hypoplasiaof premaxilla (4) single upper central and lateral incisors of the cleft side and (5) deficient septal cartilage and nasal spine. Gross brain malforma tions are usually absent in MFD. The typical facial features of MFD are also present in patients with holoprosencephaly sequence (HPE S). This clini cal overlap can be explained by similar embryological origin of MFD andHPE S. We report on two male patients with bilateral cleft lip and palateshowing the facial findings of MFD or HPE S. Additional congenital malfor mations were anal atresia in one and severe cardiac defect in the otherpatient. Both patients showed single maxillary incisors but the diagnosis ofholoprosencephaly was excluded by brain MRI. Although uncommon brainanomalies were detected consisting of multiple white matter lesions in theone and unusual enlargement and tortuosity of intracerebral blood vesselsin both patients. Further vascular anomalies were multiple teleangiectasiasseen in the integument in both patients. In addition to facial anomalies thepatients also had psychiatric problems typically seen in velo cardio facialsyndrome (VCFS). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed a22q11.2 microdeletion in both. ,2001
597,Structural aberrations of separate chromosomes led to a wide range ofclinical effects in a man. The changes of phenotype of this pathology canbe characterized with multiple malformations in one cases and insignificantdeflection in physical somatic and sexual development in the others. Approximately 2 6% of all the cases of aberrations of somatic chromo somes in live birth children compose ring chromosomes. The discription of2 children with ring chromosomes from unrelated families are presentedhere. Proband 1. The boy of 12 years old with border line intellectual insuf ficiency has suffered with the loss of consciousness from 6 years old. Hehad multiple pigmentari spots of uncertain diameter placed diffusively onthe skin surface. Besides the child had short stature stretching face mon goloid palpebral fissures and spinal hypertrichosis. Karyotype is46 XY r(17)(p12q22) Parents karyotypes are normal. Proband 2. The boyof 14 months old was observed in connection with two sided cryp torchidism. Psychophysical development of this child corresponds to hisage. During examination acrocephaly synophrys depressed nasal bridge epicantic folds prominent mandible were discovered. Karyotype is 46 XY r(18)(p11q22). Parents karyotypes are normal. Unlike previouslydescribed cases cryptorchidism proved to be the only manifistation ofthese chromosome aberrations. ,2001
598,Nephronophthisis (NPH) is a chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis leading toterminal renal insufficiency. The main symptoms are polydipsia andpolyuria caused by decreased urinary concentrating ability and anemia. The disease is heterogeneous but usually the inheritance pattern is auto somal recessive. In 80% of cases the disease is caused by a homozygousdeletion in NPHP1 gene in chromosome 2q13. Tapetoretinal regeneration congenital hepatic fibrosis neurologic findings and skeletal changes mayoccur as extrarenal manifestations with NPH. Ulcerative colitis is an inflam matory bowel disease with chronic diarrhea rectal bleeding and charac teristic histological findings. Its etiology is suggested to be multifactorial consisting of genetic susceptibility and unknown exogenous factors. Wepresent two siblings with NPH and ulcerative colitis and describe their clin ical features and laboratory findings. ,2001
599,Brachydactyly Type B is a dominantly inherited limb malformation charac terised by short 2nd to 5th fingers and toes with hypoplastic or absentnails small or absent distal phalanges small middle phalanges and vari able symphalangism. Broad thumbs with bifid distal phalanges and centralPosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 177syndactyly may also occur. In 10 affected families mutations have recent ly been identified in ROR2 a gene encoding an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase essential for normal chondrocyte differentiation. These probablyexert a specific gain of function effect ( ROR2 loss of function mutations cause Robinow syndrome when homozygous but no phenotype when het erozygous). We have reviewed a 6 generation Welsh family with limbabnormalities first described by Schott in 1978 as a novel form of heredi tary brachydactyly with nail dysplasia . Affected individuals have typicalmoderately severe Brachydactyly Type B in their hands with variableinvolvement of the 2nd to 5th fingers but no thumb abnormalities or syn dactyly. Their feet however are completely normal both clinically and radi ologically. Sequencing of the entire coding region of ROR2 in the proband revealed a 2247G to A transition predicted to convert Trp749 to a stopcodon thereby truncating the protein after its intracellular tyrosine kinasedomain. Four similar mutations including a nonsense mutation in the samecodon have previously been reported to cause a severe amputation likephenotype in the hands and typical abnormalities in the feet. Our findingsextend the range of phenotypes resulting from ROR2 mutations to include involvement of the hands alone and suggest that the effects of individualmutations may be significantly modified by genetic background. ,2001
600,FRAXE mental retardation (Xq28) is rare condition that is caused byexpansion of the CGG repeat region in the FMR2 gene. Its much more fre quent form is known as FRAXA fragile X syndrome (Xq27.3). FRAXE men tal retardation is characterized with very mild mental handicap and moreatypical clinical picture compared to FRAXA. We report the first FRAXEfamily diagnosed in Croatia. A pregnant woman (age 26 16 weeks of ges tation) was genetically counseled since one of her two brothers attended aspecial school for children with learning difficulties. DNA analysis ofFRAXA and FRAXE form of the fragile X syndrome showed that she is afull mutation carrier of FRAXE mental retardation. Close clinical examina tion detected no phenotype characteristics associated with FRAXE fullmutation. The couple decided to perform prenatal diagnosis after 18 weeksof gestation. The sex of the fetus was determined to be male. DNA analy sis of primary culture of amniotic fluid detected mosaicism of full mutatedand normal alleles for FRAXE locus. Linkage analysis of DXS548 andDXS1691 markers also showed that the fetus has inherited the same alleleas its FRAXE affected uncle. After genetic counseling the couple decidedto retain the pregnancy. Our molecular and clinical data show that FRAXEmental retardation is phenotypically very nonspecific and mild and thatevery woman with any mentally retarded family member should beanalysed for FRAXA and FRAXE loci of the fragile X syndrome. ,2001
601, halle.deFGF2 is regarded as a specific promoter for proliferation and differentiationof endothelial and smooth muscle cells and as an important risk factor ofthe atherosclerosis. We determined the FGF2 mRNA expression in humannative monocytes a cell system srongly involved in the fundamental ath erosclerotic processes at the vessel wall and screened for mutations. 416patients with angiographically proven severe CAD were included (83%male mean 50.34y). All patients had associated risk factors like hyperten sion (47%) diabetes mellitus (22.7%) smokers (77%) cholesterol (5.8mmol/l). The gene expression was determined by use of a competitive RT PCR. The mutation screening was carried out by SSCP and sequencinganalysis. We identified four genomic variants all situated in exon 1 theC+242T polymorphism and the mutations C250T G+19A G+97C. Toreveal the possible effect of the polymorphic genetic variant C242T we cal culated the mRNA folding structure (mfold version 2.3 Zucker and Turner)and found a new loop in the region of the functional important first startcodon suggesting a direct influence on functional properties. In accor dance with the importance of FGF2 for the atherosclerosis developmentwe found significant differences dependent on the coronary risk we iden tified significantly less mutation carries in the high risk patient subgroupwho suffered from CAD before 45y (0.091 vs. 0.186 p<0.05) suggesting aprotective influence of this genetic constellation. Our functional studies ofthe FGF2 gene product supported this thesis mutation carriers had a pro tective significantly decreased gene expression compared with the wildtype carriers (0.45ag/U vs. 1.054ag/U p<0.04). ,2001
602,Friedreich s ataxia (FA) a neurodegenerative disorder is the most frequentform of hereditary ataxia with a prevalence of 1 50 000. We reported car diac aspects of 25 Brazilian patients with clinical diagnosis of FA related tothe frequency and size of expanded GAA repeats. The cardiac studyincluded physical examination with electrocardiogram and echocardiogramof all patients. Molecular analysis to detect (GAA)n repeat length was per formed by PCR according to Filla et al. (1996). Homozygous GAA expan sion repeats were detected in 17 cases (68%) all typical cases. In 8patients (32%) (6 atypical and 2 typical) none expansion was observed therefore they were not FA. All patients with GAA expansion (100%) pre sented electrocardiogram abnormalities but only 25% without GAAexpansion showed it. The main electrocardiogram abnormality was relatedto ventricular repolarization (50%). Only 6% of patients referred cardiacsignals and/or symptoms. The molecular analysis is essential to confirmthe diagnosis of FA however a complete clinical and cardiac evaluation specially an electrocardiogram may help us to better select the cases thatshould perform these tests. ,2001

Molecular cytogenetic investigations were performed in 3cases to improve the reliability of the cytogenetic analysis(Institut fuerMedizinische Genetik der Universitaet Zurich Zuerich Switzerland byU. Wiedemann and A. Baumer) The investigations revealed the high inci dence of genetic causes in patients with RSD. ,2001
604, erlangen.deWe report on a family in which mother and two daughters were affectedwith Osteopathia Striata with Cranial Sclerosis (OS CS). All patientsshowed striated bones and cranial sclerosis. One of the daughters gavebirth to a male with a dysmorphic syndrome with multiple malformationsincluding severe cranial sclerosis with frontal bossing cleft palate thoracicdysplasia skeletal malformations including bilateral syndactyly of 3. and 4.fingers bilateral polydactyly of the distal phalanx of both 2. fingers bilater al fibular aplasia and anal atresia. There were however no bony stria tions. Karyotype was normal. Linkage analysis with X chromosomal poly morphic markers is in progress. This is the 13. observation of a severelyaffected male from women with OS CS. These sons suffered from a char acteristic syndrome with cranial sclerosis cleft palate conductive or mixedhearing impairment thoracic dysplasia respiratory distress and variousvertebral and intestinal malformations. The majority of cases deceasedwithin the first year of live. Our patient is the first reported case with hyper trophic pylorus stenosis and anal atresia. OMIM quotes OS CS as an het erogeneous disorder with an autosomal dominant (*166500)and a rare X linked variant (311280). However in genetic diseases striated tissue affec tions are characteristic for genetic mosaicism either by X inactivation infemales or by early somatic mutation in males. Moreover among all report ed family observations there is no family with convincing autosomal domi nant segregation. Therefore we hypothesise that all cases of OS CS areX linked and there is no indication to assume genetic heterogeneity with anautosomal dominat variant. ,2001
605,Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder charac terized by growth retardation mental deficiency ptosis of eyelids antev erted nostrils limb anomalies genital abnormalities including hypospadias micro penis cryptorchidism. In this report we present a proband withSmith Lemli Opitz Syndrome showing a reciprocal translocation between7p14 and 9q21. The proband is 8 months old Turkish male who referred toClinical Genetics Department for ambiguous genitalia. He had been admit ted to the Pediatrics department for respiratory distress and genitallyabnormality. The parents are not consanguineous. On admission he was5700 gr weights 65 cm length and head circumference of 41 cm. All ofthese measurements were below the 3 percentile. Clinical examinationshowed wide forehead inner epicanthal folds blue iris strabismus shortnose anteverted nares low set and back turned malformed ears microg nathia short fingers with flexion contractures short phallus hypoplasticscrotum cryptorchidism and hypospadias. There was also motor develop mental delay and peripheral facial paralysis on the right side. Routineblood biochemical investigations were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography echocardiography cranial CT and MR were found to be normal. Chromo some analysis with G and C banding revealed a male karyotype with recip rocal translocation between 7p14 and 9q21. The parent s karyotypes werenormal. The explanation of the clinical feature of the patient should be lossof genetic material while recombination of the chromosomes during meio sis. ,2001
606,In the Netherlands the total number of people with mental retardation (MR)is estimated to be 120.000. About 45.000 of them live in institutions or insmall group homes (partially) integrated into normal neighbourhoods and75.000 live with their families or on their own. Knowledge of the etiology ofMR is known to have advantages with regard to prognostic therapeuticand reproductive counseling. The etiological work up of MR forms a cen tral part of the work of the 8 Dutch clinical genetics centers and is realizedon request of the family and/or general practitioner or as part of standard ized evaluation offered to the institutions. We present our approach to theevaluation of MR which follows an extensive protocol including pre andpostnatal history physical examination focussing on dysmorphism and thebehavioural phenotype laboratory testing and discussion in a multidiscipli nary expert team. The procedure and results are exemplified by present ing data of one of the institutions in South Netherland. ,2001
607,Mutations in HOXD13 are known to cause synpolydactyly but have not pre viously been identified in any other congenital limb malformation.

608,Craniosynostosis is a common congenital malformation occuring inapproximately 1in 2500 live births. Most of the cases are isolated forms. Only few cases represent well known craniosynostosis syndromes. Muta tions in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs)1 3 have been identifiedin several syndromic forms as well as in non syndromic craniosynostosis. We enrolled 74 consecutive unrelated Austrian (58) and South Tyrolean(16) patients with craniosynostosis in a clinical genetic and molecularinvestigation of exons of FGFR1 3 genes. So far we identified FGFR2(S252W P253R C278F C342S) and FGFR3 (P250R) mutations in 14patients (17%). The clinical diagnosis of Apert syndrome was confirmed inall 6 patients. In 3 out of 8 cases of Crouzon syndrome we identified amutation in nan,2001
609,Rett syndrome (RS) is a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder thataffects females(almost exclusively) with an incidence of 1 in 10.000 to15.000. After an apparently normal period of development acquired mile stones are lost at an age of 6Ã¢\x80\x9418 months and a specific neurological dis order evolves with stereotypic hand wringing or clapping and preservedvisual eyepointing as the most typical symptoms. Loss of speech and dys tonic movement disorder together with severe cognitive deficit and epilep sy are predominant in this complex and puzzeling disorder leading overdecades into severe multi impairment. In 1999 RS was shown to becaused by deletions in the MECP2 gene by Zoghbi et al.. MECP2 deletionsaccount for up to 75% of cases with classical RS. We present 8 cases ofadult females with a deletion in the MECP2 gene. Diagnosis of RS wasmade conform to the clinical criteria although it was not always easy toconfirm this diagnosis on the basis of retrospective clinical data alone. Theclinical neurological behavourial and habilitation data will be presentedand an attempt is made to phenotype genotype correlation. ,2001
610,Most cases of Kallmann syndrome are caused by mutations or deletions ofthe KALX gene on the Xp22.3. However Kallmann syndrome seems to beheterogeneous with at least one autosomal form. Syndrome has beenreported in several patients with unbalanced (Schinzel et al. 1995) or bal anced (Best et al. 1990 Cassamassima et al. 1993 Kroisel et al. 2000)autosomal rearrangements. We have observed the young man with Kall mann syndrome and apparently balanced translocation. The patient age22 has anosmia eunuchoid habitus hypogonadism and hypogenitalism absence of body hair underdevelopment of axillary and pubic hair short ening of the 4th metatarsal bones dry and flaccid skin. The results ofendocrinological investigations were compatible with hypogonadotropichypogonadism very low basal LH (0.5 IU/l) and FSH (0.8 IU/l) and prepu bertal testosterone (2.7 nmol/l). Cytogenetic study showed a balancedtranslocation t(3 14)(q29 q21). Therefore the segments 3q29 and 14q21should be added to the list of possible locations of autosomal gene of Kall mann syndrome. ,2001
611,Fragile X chromosome syndrome is the most frequent form of hereditarymental retardation. Costa Rica s health system does not offer molecularassessment as part of the diagnostic tools to the patients and families. Theobjectives of this project are 1. To investigate the presence of unstablemutations in the FMR1 gene to determine it s methylation status and thenumber of repetitions of the CGG triplet in affected individuals and theirfamilies. 2. To offer genetic counseling to the families. 3. To enhance theknowledge of this disorder among health personnel and special educationteachers. We have worked with children who had a previous cytogeneticdiagnosis of fra(X) syndrome (group one N=13) their near relatives (grouptwo N=30) and with children referred to us by teachers pediatricians andpsychologists (group three N=15). Southern blot and PCR have beenused to perform 58 molecular studies. Among the group one children ninehad a full mutation of the FMR1 gene and four were negative since both methods showed normal results. In group two there were two females withthe full mutation and 12 individuals with the pre mutation a normal trans mitting male and eleven female carriers. The rest of the relatives showednormal results. In group three only a girl was detected with the full muta tion the rest were normal both at the molecular as well as the cytogenet ic level. ,2001
612,In this presentation we emphasize the contribution of the behaviouralapproach in diagnosing Smith Magenis syndrome (SMS). SMS is a clini cally recognisable multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syn drome caused by an interstitial deletion of chromosomeregion 17p11.2. Inour clinical practice 11 subjects were diagnosed to have SMS. Data onpsychopathology and examination of cognitive and behavioural profiles inthese patients demonstrate that the behavioural phenotype serves as auseful diagnostic marker for SMS. After reviewing the published data onthe distinctive behavioural features recommendations are made for theindication of a diagnostic test by FISH with a probe specific for 17p11.2. ,2001
613,The Kabuki (Niikawa Kuroki) syndrome was reported in 1981 by Niikawaet al. and Kuroki et al. in a total of 10 unrelated Japanese children with acharacteristic array of multiple congenital anoma lies and mental retarda tion. The syn drome is characterized by a distinct face mild to mode ratemental retardati on postna tal growth retarda tion derma toglyp hic andskeletal abnor malities. In Japan the syndrome appears to have an inci dence of about 1 32 000 newborns. Outside of Japan a growing numberof patients has been recognized. In 2/3 of the non Japanese pa tients seri ous neurologic problems were pre sent most notably hypot onia and feed ing problems. Behavioural characteristics and neuropsychological profileare not wellknown with only a limited numbers of case reports in the liter ature. In close collaboration with the national Kabuki network a neuropsy chological research aimed at the cognitive and behavioural phenotype wasstated. The present paper reports the results of the neuropsychologicalevaluation in a series of 10 children with Kabuki syndrome ranging in agefrom 5 Ã¢\x80\x94 11 years. ,2001

615,The Kabuki (Niikawa Kuroki) syndrome (KS) first and independentlydescribed in Japan in 1981 by Niikawa et al. and Kuroki et al. is a multiplecongenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome characterized by a180 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologypeculiar facies which resembles the Kabuki theatre make up with long palpebral fissures and eversion of lower lids arched eyebrows depressednasal tip and prominent ears besides mild to moderate mental retardation postnatal growth retardation skeletal abnormalities and dermatoglyphicanomalies. The incidence in Japan was estimated around 1 32 000 new borns and the frequency of non Japanese patients is not available although the number of cases has been increasing each year. The etiolo gy remains undetermined and most cases have been sporadic. In Brazil there are few reports of the condition all of them corresponding to newcase descriptions and not the result of a systematic survey. Therefore wedecided to elaborate the present study. Between June 1998 and Decem ber 1999 18 patients were followed up by a specific clinical and laborato ry protocol based upon the main characteristics of KS. Ten individuals (3females and 7 males) were confirmed as having KS. Of the remaining 8 (4females and 4 males) 3 had Noonan syndrome 2 had Turner syndrome 1 had monosomy 18p and the other 2 did not complete their clinical eval uation. Among the KS patients 100% presented the peculiar facial aspect and mental retardation in different degrees 80% had dermatoglyphicabnormalities 60% had vertebral anomalies and 50% presented with shortstature. The present study was similar to several others in almost allaspects. Cases were sporadic sex ratio was not deviated and there wereno references to parental consanguinity or familial recurrence which sup ports the hypothesis of a mutation in a dominant inherited gene the sug gested etiology of KS. This protocol seemed useful by characterizing thestudied population and should be applied to patients with clinical featuresof KS. It deserves mention that the facial characteristics may occur indiverse conditions leading to a possible Kabuki phenotype determined byelongated palpebral fissures eversion of the lower lid and arched eyebrow. The high degree of overlapping clinical features concerning Noonan andTurner syndrome especially in patients with chromosome X rings rein forces the necessity of a through evaluation when one of these conditionsis considered present at initial diagnosis. More detailed studies concerningthese issues and involving several genetic centers might contribute to abetter characterization of KS. ,2001
616,Triopia (three eyes) is a very rare condition. It was first reported by Stel nicki et al. (1995). These authors interpreted the presence of two globes inthe left orbit as prosencephalon duplication. We have recently assessed amale patient second child of a young healthy non consanguineous cou ple. The patient presented a complex malformation involving the centralnervous system craniofacial structures and remarkedly the eyes. Mainclinical findings included broad and backward sloping forehead plagio brachycephaly wide skull sutures a large facial cleft extending upward tothe nose a Tessier number 9 bilaterally abnormally developed orbits withtwo hypoplastic and colobamatous globes at right and a hypoplastic andcolobamatous eye at left (triopia) and low set and posteriorly rotated ears. G banded chromosomes were normal. Molecular study of the gene PAX6showed no mutation. MRI revealed no duplication of prosencephalie struc tures. The gestation was uneventful without any known ingestion of terato gens by the mother. Up to now we have been seeking for an embryologicexplanation for the ocular malformation presented by the patient. Support ed by Funda o Lucentis ,2001
617,We describe a neonate with systemic Echovirus Type 11 infection whopresented with an acute hyperammonemia rapidly progressive multisys temic failure and fatal outcome. The patient presented at age 7 days withacute hyperammonemia lethargy and hypothermia. Despite an aggressivetherapy including inotropic support ammonia conjugating therapy andhemodialysis symptoms progressed and led to the fatal outcome at age 9days. A dominant symptom of hyperammonemia in an otherwise normalneonate without known risk factors was suggestive of a metabolic decom pensation. The patient underwent an extensive diagnostic evaluation. Afterexclusion of several metabolic disorders the diagnosis of the infectious eti ology was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in liver andspleen tissue. Increased awareness for a number of metabolic disordersand improved diagnostic capabilities for detection of rare inherited condi tions may bias toward neglecting other etiologies of neonatal liver failure. The possibility of perinatal infection as a cause of severe hyperammone mia and fulminant hepatic failure should be kept in mind when evaluatinga sick neonate. ,2001
618,Cranio osteoarthropathy is a rare AR disorder defined by hypertrophicosteoarthropathy clubbed fingers painful periarticular swelling chroniceffusion in large joints and eczematous skin lesions. We present a case inorder to illustrate this rare disorder and to present some particular featuresrecorded in this case. Our proband is the second child of a healthy young unrelated couple. Pregnancy and birth were uneventful. Postnatal devel opment was normal except the early tooth eruption and frequent chestinfections. We have examined the child when he was 5 years old. He pre sented tall stature astenic build with diminished muscle bulk increasedsweating delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle (still present!) matinalpain and swelling of large joints and clubbing of fingers and toes. Radi ographies showed mild bone resorbtion of distal phalanges and tubularcoarse long bones. Lab investigations showed anemia and oxalic cristalsin the urine. Based on the clinical and radiological features we have estab lished the diagnosis of cranio osteoarthropathy. We have done the differ ential diagnosis with infantile cortical hyperostosis and pachydermoperios tosis. In conclusion we present a child with cranio osteoarthropathy toillustrate this very rare disorder and to present the association of earlytooth eruption frequent chest infections anemia and presence of urinaryoxalic cristals features not cited in the literature until now. ,2001
619,Anal sphincter dysplasia (ASDP) has been described as anteriorly or ven trally displaced anus (OMIM 105563). Absent or incomplete fixation of thesphincter to the coccyx are demonstratable by computer tomography aswell as by intraoperative dissection of the sphincter muscles. The range ofsymptoms included chronic constipation severe straining at defecation encopresis and chronic paradoxical diarrhea with fecal incontinence. Thiscongenital malformation occurs often familial and an autosomal dominantmode of inheritance with reduced penetrance has been suggested. Recently mutations in the HLXB9 homeobox gene have been described inthe DNA of patients with Currarino syndrome an autosomal dominantinherited form of sacral agenesis. Because anorectal malformations are acomponent of the Currarino syndrome the HLXB9 gene was analyzed inthe DNA of 20 probands affected from ASDP with several affected familymembers. The three exons of the HLXB9 gene were amplified using ninedifferent primer pairs and the PCR products were analyzed by singlestrand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. There was no evi dence for mutations in this gene in the analyzed DNA samples. ,2001

Wepresent a case of achondrogenesis type IA in order to underline the possi bilities of prenatal diagnosis and also the importance of detailed radiologicand pathologic examination for the final diagnosis and genetic counselling. Our proband is the first child of a healthy young unrelated couple. Preg nancy evolved with threatened abortion at 28 weeks gestation fetal ultra sound scan recorded polyhidramnios very short limbs hypoplastic lungs hydronephrosis. Therapeutic termination of pregnancy was indicated. Physical examination of the fetus revealed dysmorphic face narrow chest very short limbs generalized edema. Radiologic investigation showed poorly ossified skull unossified vertebral bodies crenate ilia short squarelong bones. Pathologic examination also revealed hypoplastic lungs andhydronephrotic kidneys with dilated ureters. Histopathologic studiesdemonstrated hypercellular cartilage with clustered chondrocytes within adiffuse matrix and PAS positive diastase resistant granules inside thePosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 181chondrocytes. Based on the clinical and paraclinical data we have setab lished the diagnosis of achondrogenesis type IA AR. We have done dif ferential diagnosis with other lethal chondrodystrophies (homozygoteachondroplasia thanatoforic dysplasia) and the other forms of achondro genesis. In conclusion we present this case to show the importance ofprenatal and pathologic examination for the complete diagnosis and cor rect genetic counselling in lethat chondrodystrophies. ,2001
621,Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory deficit and is detected inabout 1/1000 children before 1 year of age. HL has a genetic origin in upto 60% of cases and is of an unparalleled heterogeneity. A clinical evalua tion and Cx26 mutation analysis were performed in 155 consecutivepatients with sensorineural hearing loss in order to delineate the spectrumof genetically caused hearing loss. The aetiology of HL was determined tobe hereditary in 47% of patients either due to Cx26 mutations (18.7%) togenetically caused congenital syndromes (11.6%) or to the presence of apositive family history (16.8%). Cx26 mutations were found in 21.2% ofpatients with non syndromic HL (31.5% of familial vs. 17% of sporadiccases). The mutation 35delG accounted for 46.6% of all presumed GJB2disease alleles. The second most frequent mutation was L90P (10.3%)having been reported with a prevalence of 0 7 3 5% in other populations. Of three novel mutations one (R143Q) was associated with dominanthigh frequency hearing loss. A dominant de novo mutation R75W wasobserved in a patient with profound HL. Pseudodominant transmission ofNSHL was seen in 4 families with Cx26 mutations. A mutation 35delG car rier rate of 0 9% was observed among 672 controls from Tirol (West Aus trian province). Cx26 mutations were found associated with mild to pro found and with asymmetric hearing impairment. ,2001
622,In this study we aimed to determine the role of genetic factors in our regionin the couples with habituel abortions and/or stillbirth to help couples withthis kind of situation. In our study we have a total of 419 people. Of thistwo hundred two couples (404 cases) are recurrent fetal losses and 5 arecordocentesis materials from pregnant women with fetal anomalies andfinally we have 10 death babies with multiple malformations of the perina tal period. The distribution of the couples with fetal losses is as followed 122 couples with habituel abortions whose abortion number vary for eachcase between 2 and 10 and 50 couples with up to 5 stillbirths and 30 cou ples with both abortion and stillbirth. While the women s ages were varyingbetween 18 and 42 men s ages were changing between 21 and 58 in allgroups. Consanguinity rate among the parents was 25 2%. This ratio was18 9% among the parents with habituel abortions 36% among the parentswith stillbirths and 33 3% among the parents with both habituel abortionand stillbirth. One hundred thirty five couples of 202 analysed for cytoge netics. While men did not show any chromosomal aberrations a total of 6women revealed various chromosomal aberration A total of 137 stillbirthcases or early death babies of perinatal period were recorded by 80 cou ples. Sixty eight of 137 cases have various anomalies (49 6%). Distributionof the etiology of malformations showed that mendelian disorders were27 7% multifactorial disorders were 16 1% and chromosomal disorderswere 5 8%. ,2001
623,Aims Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in its acute stages ischaracterised by neutrophil mediated inflammation and glomerular injury. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of mutations in exonV of the human neutrophil elastase (HNE) gene in South African paediatricrenal patients presenting with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS). Methods Forty three Black(27 boys 16 girls) and 15 White (13 boys 2 girls) paediatricnephrotic patients were recruited from the Paediatric Nephrology Unit Johannesburg Hospital South Africa. These included those presentingwith FSGS Minimal Change Disease (MCD) congenital NS and otherrenal conditions. HNE exon V was amplified from whole blood DNA. Ampli cons were sequenced and screening extended by ARMS PCR. Signifi cance was assessed using two sided Chi squared and Fisher s Exacttests. Results A novel GTC (Val190) to ATC (Ile190) transition was detect ed in HNE exon V in 4 of 18 (22%) Black patients with FSGS as comparedwith asymptomatic Black controls (0%)(p=0.008). The mutation wasabsent from Black patients with other renal diseases as well as from Whitepatients. Protein modelling revealed the position of the mutation to be in thesubstrate binding pocket of HNE where the residue plays a role in sub strate specificity. Conclusions A novel mutation in the substrate bindingpocket of HNE is associated with FSGS in Black paediatric nephrotics which may explain the increased prevalence of FSGS in this group. Alter ations in HNE substrate specificity may contribute to glomerular injury. ,2001
624,It is self evident that the prevention of birth defects (BD) is a complex taskand that the World Wide Web (web) is a major communicaiton tool. Manyweb information providers are organizations with missions that are nar rower than the full range of BD related issues. On the other hand manyinternational information consumers have limited access to and the need ed skills necessary to expeditiously find scattered reliable BD web infor mation sources. Furthermore not in English materials are limited andmany web sites offer incomplete outdated or even slanted information. Such considerations prompted the development of IBIS a web site forinternational information consumers and dedicated to the prevention andamelioration of BD. IBIS started by sharing resources of programs inAlabama Ukraine and Latin America. (http //ibis birthdefects.org/start/)IBIS offers access to carefully selected web sites and not in Englishsources. International contributors are urged to develop and post on IBIS BD information sheets that adhere to published quality standards. IBISversions in Ukrainian and Spanish are growing and versions in other lan guages are emerging. In a six month period and without promotion con sumers visited IBIS at a rate of 50000 per year. Some related satellite siteshave even a greater number of visitors. Organizations can contribute toIBIS by concentrating on web site contents related to their mission andlinking with IBIS regarding other matters relevant to the care prevention and amelioration of BD. ,2001
625,182 Posters: Clinical Genetics and DysmorphologyTerminal 22q13 deletions are rare. Although a few reported cases have had variable clinical findings it appears that a recognizable phenotypewhich includes mild facial dysmorphism pervasive developmental disorderand hypotonia is emerging. We present a 2 year old female referred dueto multiple congenital anomalies dysmorphic features and unexplainedhypotonia. After birth she was found to have an hypoplastic left pulmonaryartery with anomalous aorto pulmonary vessels that required surgical cor rection. A routine karyotype was initially reported as normal. A 22q13 dele tion was detected incidentally when the control probe for theDiGeorge/VCFS region (ARSA) was found deleted. Parental karyotypeshave been reported as normal. Interestingly in a recent review 3 out of 4patients previously thought to have an isolated 22q13 terminal deletionwere found to have a cryptic subtelomeric rearrangement instead. By pre senting this case and reviewing the literature we would like to emphasizethe need for further studies and investigation on patients presenting withthis phenotype. ,2001
626,Adults with TSC may develop renal and pulmonary complications. Approx imately 70% have renal cysts and/or angiomyolipomas (RAML) which canlead to renal failure or hemorrhage. 2 3% develop pulmonary cysts or lym phangiomyomatosis which can cause recurrent pneumothorax and/orprogressive respiratory insufficiency. Whether pregnancy exacerbatesthese risks is unknown. 113 of 420 questionnaires sent to NTSA membersfor information regarding pregnancy were returned. Seven lacked sufficientinformation to confirm TSC 3 were incomplete. 22 women had never beenpregnant (11 with renal disease and 6 with lung involvement) 3 had RAMLwithout TSC. 49 women with renal involvement had 122 pregnancies and29 without renal involvement had 58 pregnancies. Pregnancy complica tions included bleeding from RAML in two renal pain in one and kidneystones in two. One woman without kidney disease developed pregnancy associated renal stones. A fifth of both groups developed toxemia. Pneu mothorax occurred in 2 women. No maternal or fetal deaths occurred. Among women never pregnant renal/pulmonary complications developedin 36% and 33% respectively. Limitations of the study included inability todetermine if renal involvement predated pregnancy (in many diagnosis ofTSC was made after birth of an affected infant) and validity of self reports. While the literature reports a 21% incidence of renal hemorrhage duringpregnancy (7 out of 33 pregnancies) our results suggest it is much lower. We recommend that women with TSC receive renal and pulmonary evalu ation prior to pregnancy. Pregnancies should be closely monitored. Thepresence of either RAML or pulmonary cysts is not a contraindication topregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes in a survey of adult women with TSC ,2001
627, nancy.frThyroid abnormalities have been reported in association with the 22q11deletion syndrome. One case of congenital hypothyroidism linked to thy roid dysgenesis has been reported by Scuccimarri (). We previouslyreported in two patients with the syndrome of 22q11 deletion the onset ofHashimoto type of auto immune thyroiditis (ESHG Lisbon 1998). Recentlya case of Graves disease has been reported in a 18 year old woman withevidence of DiGeorge syndrome related to a 22q11 deletion (Kawamura T2000). Herewith we report on a patient with the 22q11 deletion syndrome in whom a Graves syndrome complicated the clinical evolution at the ageof 18 years. He was born in 1980 from a 28 years old father and 24 yearsold mother who had been previously treated for a Graves disease. At birththe diagnosis of cardiac malformation (aortic arch kinking retro oesophageal right subclavian artery) and a posterior palatine cleft lead tothe discussion of a mild form of DiGeorge syndrome. There was no evi dence for immune deficiency or hypocalcemia. Later on developmentalmilestones were delayed and his school progression was delayed. Hisdiagnosis was not reevaluated before 1998 at which time he developedevidence for Graces disease with high levels of antiTSH receptor andantithyroperoxydase antibodies. 22q11 deletion was demonstrated byFISH. His hematological and immunological evaluation show mild throm bopenia with increased mean volume low level of IgM decreasedresponse to polysaccharide vaccination antigenes mild lymphopenia anddecreased T lymphocyte response. Compared to our two cases withHashimoto thyroiditis and other 22q11 deleted patients the immunologicalprofile is similar. Thyroid dysfunction in 22q11 deleted patient is thereforequite frequent and requires regular evaluation of both the antibody profileand thyroid function during follow up especially if there is a familial pre disposition for auto immune disease. ,2001
628,A female child was diagnosed with Weaver syndrome based on typicaldysmorphic features and growth pattern. She had developmental delayand overgrowth. She was hypotonic with delay in motor and other mile stones obvious by 12 months. By 4 months height and weight >90th per centile and head large. By 7 months ht wt >97th. Bone age was advanced 18/12 at 11/12 and 3 yrs 6 mths at 1 yr 11mnths. At 3 years a Stage 1 leftWilms tumour was diagnosed and successfully treated with radiotherapyand chemotherapy. There was a history of mental retardation. Her brotherwas mild/mod delayed in development without dysmorphism. The motherhad two normal looking brothers with moderate intellectual handicap. Kary otypes on all retarded individuals and parents normal. Fragile X testing ofboth children and uncles normal. 3 rdchild (female) born with very similar dysmorphic features to proband but without significant overgrowth. Repeatkaryotypes and careful review showed mother has a balanced transloca tion (12 22) and both female offspring have unbalanced karyotype Der 12and male has Der 22. These results confirmed by FISH. Further familystudies showed that both mother s brothers uncle and cousin carry theDer 22 chromosome. This case illustrates that in retardation without dys morphism malformation or poor growth (non specific mental retardation)can be due to crytpic aneuploidy. It also shows that in a suspicious case acareful cytogenetic review can direct FISH studies appropriately. The ques tion of whether some or all of the features of Weaver syndrome are due tomonosomy of genes at 12q and/or trisomy of telomeric genes at 22q israised. ,2001
629,Smith Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a MCA/MR syndrome caused by amicrodeletion of chromosome 17p11.2. Individuals with SMS are typicallycharacterized by minor craniofacial anomalies short stature brachydacty ly visual and auditory impairment behaviour problems sleep disturbance and cardiac and renal malformations. The exact incidence of this conditionis unknown but it is believed that this condition is underdiagnosedbecause of its recent description and the lack of a pathognomonic pheno type. To estimate the frequency of SMS among patients with mental retar dation/ developmental delay (MR/DD) we screened over 1600 DNA sam ples from patients with undiagnosed (MR/DD). Our molecular screeningprotocol included Southern blotting and co hybridization with a SMS dele tion specific probe and a control probe for dosages comparison. Samplessuspected to have SMS deletion based on this screening were test furtherby either FISH if fresh blood samples were obtained or by GeneScan onthe DNA samples.

630,Background In cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcorticalinfarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) multiple lacunar infarcts leadto cognitive decline and finally subcortical dementia. It is caused by differ ent missense mutations in Notch3 gene which encodes a transmembranereceptor protein Notch3. We describe the first homozygous CADASILpatient in comparison with nine age matched (Ã¢\x80\x93 2 years) patients het erozygous for the same R133C mutation. Clinical details and pathology A52 year old male whose deceased father and two paternal uncles had ahistory of similar cerebrovascular disease. His mother had died at the ageof 31 of tuberculosis without known neurological disease. His grandfatherand one maternal aunt had died of stroke. The patient has not hadmigraine. He had his first stroke at 28 and a recurrence at 37 years of age. CT revealed periventricular white matter hypodensities. Neurologicaldeficits and psychiatric symptoms progressed and cognitive declinebecame manifest around the age of 45. Eight years later the patient wasmoderately demented scoring 19 in MMSE. CADASIL diagnosis at the ageof 52 was based on characteristic MRI changes granular osmiophilicmaterial around the degenerative smooth muscle cells in dermal arteriesand identification of the R133C mutation. Genetic analysis Exon 4 of theNotch 3 gene was amplified by PCR. PCR product was digested withMspA1I restriction endonuclease to detect the C475T transversion muta tion which leads to replacement of arginine 133 with cysteine (R133C). To rule out the possibility that a primer binding site polymorphism preventedthe amplification of a normal allele internal primers were also used. Therestriction pattern of this patient was consistent with a homozygous muta tion which was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The gene defect was alsodemonstrated in one living paternal relative. On the basis of the patientÃÂ«sfamily history supported by the fact that R133C is a common mutation inFinnish CADASIL families the patientÃÂ«s both parents must have been het erozygous carriers of the mutation. In comparison with nine age matched(Ã¢\x80\x93 2 years) heterozygous CADASIL R133C patients our homozygouspatient has the earliest onset (stroke) most prominent MRI changes andsecond most advanced cognitive decline (alcohol abuse possibly con tributing to the rapid decline of the most severe affected heterozygote).The course of the homozygous patientÃÂ«s disease was exceptionally pro tracted. Conclusion In dominant diseases heterozygous and homozygouspatients should in principle be equally affected but this rule has severalexceptions. Our patientÃÂ«s disease represents the severe end of the clinical spectrum among the age matched CADASIL patients. However becauseit is not an order of magnitude more severe it indicates that the doubledose of defective Notch3 gene causes at most a minor aggravation of thesymptoms. ,2001
631,Metatropic dysplasia is a rare but well delineated skeletal dysplasia. Basedon morphological criteria as well as life expectancy and rare familial recur rence the disorder is subdivided into several categories with a differentmode of inheritance. We report here on three additional male patients rep resenting this entity. Radiologically patient 1 and 2 represent with a simi lar severity of skeletal changes whereas the clinical course differs. Patient3 shows relatively mild skeletal findings. The rarity of affected sibs and ofconsanguinity in the published pedigrees raises doubt about the assumedautosomal recessive mode of inheritance. A single clinical entity with awide variability ranging from mild to perinatal lethal phenotypes and auto somal dominant transmission is to favor. ,2001
632,"Mesomelic limb shortening can be accompanied by malformations of oth ers organs. Dyschondrosteosisi is the most frequent form of this skeletonanomaly. Reduction of stature Madelung s deformity mesomelia of limbsare clinically apparent. Bony exostosis deformation of femoral andbrachial bones and deafness are also possible. The combinations withmalformations of genitalia are not described according to this patology. Five children (4 girls and 1 boy) from four unrelated families wereobserved. All these children had the signs of dyschondrosteosisi andhypoplasia of genitalia resulted in delayed puberty in females. All the chil dren had short stature mesomelic limb shortening Madelung s deformity. Hypoplasia of genitalia in girls was demonstrated by hypoplastic uteruscombined with gonadal dysgenesis in one case and with hypoplasticovaries in another one. Two sided cryptorchidism has been diagnosticatedin a boy since birth. Karyotypes of children were normal. In four casesshort stature mesomelia and Madelung s deformity were inherited frommothers and in one case from father. Heredity of mesomelia andMadelung s deformity were corresponded to autosomal dominant type. The other types of malformation of genitalia were not observed in thesefamilies. These parents had healthy sibs 2 girls and 2 boys didn t showany skeleton anomalies and malformations of genitalia. However we can texclude an accidental combination of dyschondrosteosisi and malforma tion of genitalia. This finding shows the importance of detailed evaluationof genitalia in patients with dyschondrosteosisi in order to prevent disodersof sexual development.184 Posters: Clinical Genetics and DysmorphologyP0436.

633,Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) is the most common lethal skeletal dyspla sia with an incidence of 1 in 20.000. Typical features are micromelic short ening of limbs trident hands platyspondyly macrocephaly short ribs withnarrow thoracic cavity resulting in respiratory failure and characteristic X ray findings with cupped spur like irregular flaring of metaphyses. TD hasbeen subdivided into two different subtypes. TD1 is characterized bybowed long bones with telephone receiver appearance of femurs and usu ally without craniosynostosis whereas TD2 shows straight femurs and aclover leaf skull. In both types mutations in the FGFR3 gene were identi fied. We present our radiological morphological and molecular geneticfindings in three fetuses with TD of 22 27 and 24 gestational weeks. Twoof them either showed typical TD1 or TD2 symptoms .

634,We present a 24 year old girl with multiple hamartomateous lesions whomhad been first admitted to the genetic department as an 18 months oldchild. The prominent features of the case were a macrodactylic left thumband index finger multiple cranial and facial osteomas macrocephaly anda caf au lait spot of 1 cm on the neck. The left tonsil was found to beenlarged. Radiological examination revealed osteomas of the skull as wellas advanced bone age of the left hand enlargement of the left 11th rib increased corpus hight on the left part of the 12th dorsal vertebra whichcaused scoliosis. Computerised tomography displayed dilated ventricleson the left side. The case had been followed up for 22years and during thisperiod she underwent tonsillectomy excisional biopsy of an osteoma andamputation of the index finger. Histopathologic examination of the left ton sil was consistent with hamartomateous hyperplasia osteomas displayedroughened lamellae of bone and bone marrow which was rich in fat cells. The chromosome analysis from peripheral blood was 46 XX. This casehad been previously presented in 1982 Firenze Italy Identification ofGenetic Syndrome in Pediatrics International postgraduate course as a new entity entitled Multiple exostoses in the skull facial ear and thoracalasymmetry unilateral macrodactyly. Is it a new entity? . We believe thatthis case is different from the previously described patients of Proteus syn drome and other related syndromes. She displayed fully penetrant expres sion of congenital hamartomateous pathologies. Molecular studies of sim ilar cases will clarify either the presented case is a separate entity or agenetic heterogeneity. ,2001
635,Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in 7.4 100 000 males and 1.2 100 000females and predominantly affects young males. In addition to being spo radic spontaneous pneumothorax is known to occur in patients with Mar fan and Ehlers Danlos syndrome type IV. However there is also an inher ited form of spontaneous pneumothorax without any other symptoms orsigns of connective tissue disorder. This autosomal dominant form of spon taneous pneumothorax has a low penetrance both in males and females. It has been estimated that only 50% of male and 20 35% of female genecarriers actually develop pneumothorax. We have identified a large Finnishpedigree in which spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in three successivegenerations with several obligatory gene carriers who have not had anysymptoms of lung disease. To study whether they actually have bullouslung lesions we have studied several family members with high resolutioncomputerized tomography (HRCT). Of the 7 people studied so far only one(a male aged 27 yrs) seems to be unaffected. All others (family memberswho have experienced pneumothorax or are obligatory carriers) have bul lous lung lesions. These bullae are located anywhere in the lung and notparticularly in the apical areas. We propose that the risk of having sponta neous pneumothorax is at least partly dependent on the location that is ifthe bullous lesions are inside the lung the risk of rupture and pneumotho rax is low. If however the bullae are on the surface of the lung the risk ishigher. So far the HRCT findings in this family are 100% penetrant. Weconclude that spontaneous pneumothorax in some families is inherited asan autosomal dominant trait. Although the penetrance of actual sponta neous pneumothorax is low particularly in women the penetrance of bul lous lung disease studied with HRCT is high perhaps 100%. ,2001
636,A wide spectrum of usually severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes hasbeen observed in patients with mutations in the methyl CpG binding pro tein 2 (MECP2) gene located in Xq28 typical and milder/atypical Rett syn drome (in females and males) Angelman like neurodevelopmental pheno type and severe non specific mental retardation affecting male patients. We found an Arg to Trp substitution (R167W) in 4 retarded males of a 4generation XLMR pedigree. The substituted residue located 4 amino acidsdownstream to the methyl CpG binding domain is conserved acrossspecies. The mutation occurred in a region where only nonsense muta tions (leading most likely to a drastic loss of function) have been described leading to a Rett phenotype. The four studied males present the same neu rodevelopmental features mild mental delay (IQ > 50 3/4 can read andwrite albeit with difficulties) talkative friendly personality (3/4) obesity(3/4) non progressive neurological anomalies consisting of brisk reflexesin the lower limbs (4/4) and essential tremor (3/4). One of the boys hadsevere behavioral problems. Among obligate carrier women at least 2present with essential tremor and normal intelligence. The phenotype inthis family probably represents the mildest expression of MECP2 mutationrecorded in man. It clearly raises the hypothesis that MECP2 could play amajor role in non specific MR and could become the second gene (withFRAXA) that would be necessary to screen systematically in patients withunexplained non syndromic MR. ,2001
637,Hypomelanosis of Ito (HI) was first described by Ito in 1952 in a patient withPosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 185hypopigmented lesions in a zig zag pattern on the trunk and linear pat tern along the arms. Since then many cases are reported mostly present ing extracutaneous anomalies. High variable clinical manifestations spo radic occorence and the frequent finding of chromossomal mosaicismsuggested that HI is a cutaneous marker of genetic mosaicism. We reportthe clinical evolution of 12 HI sporadic patients seen in the last 17 years inour Clinics. Diagnosis done between 3 months and 17 years. All present ed extracutaneous manifestations including (2 cases) exuberant fibromason accidental scars. The typical hypopigmented lesions were present in allthe patients but they faded with the age in the older. Chromossomalmosaicism was found on fibroblasts in 3 of 11 patients analysed. Compar ing groups with and without mosaicism we found that all the mosaicpatients present an evident and constant asymmetry but the mental devel opment is not worst namely 2 of these 3 adults patients having a normalintelligence are attending the university. The importance of more clinicaland cytogenetic data in the genetic counselling of patients with HI must beemphasized. ,2001
638,FRAXE full mutations are rare and appear to be associated with mild men tal retardation and with a fragile site in Xq28. This is due to an abnormalexpanded GCC repeat adjacent to a methylated CpG island proximal tothe FMR2 gene. As part of a routine diagnosis all individuals referred to usfor Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) study and tested FRAXA negative werestudied for FRAXE mutation. Among 485 index case patients 2 were iden tified with the FRAXE full mutation both with cytogenetic expression of thefragile site (29 and 23% respectively) and with no history of mental retar dation. One of them has an autistic disorder with severe MR an a dysmor phic face similar to FXS. The second one is a nearly normal man with nor mal phenotype but who had learning difficulties at school when he was achild. Their families were also studied with a total of 16 members at risktested. We found 6 of them normal (3 men and 3 women) and 10 carrierwomen (4 premutated and 6 fully mutated). None of these women presentany type of mental impairment. The last sample studied was a fully mutat ed female foetus that was spontaneously aborted after obtaining chorionicvilli for prenatal diagnosis. Although the GCC expansion was greater than0.8 kb it was unmethylated in the majority of the tissues studied by us. So even though molecular study of FRAXE mutation is now available furtherstudies are nedeed for the purpose of genetic counselling and prenataldiagnosis. ,2001
639,Since the identification of the specific gene defect in 1992 direct moleculartesting for the Myotonic dystrophy mutation has developed as a wide spread service in clinical practice. Between 1992 and 2000 the MolecularDiagnostic laboratory of the Institute of Medical Genetics Cardiff has per formed a total of 526 tests 292 of these have been for the population ofWales (population 2 9 million). 213 of the samples from Wales werereferred by clinical geneticists and 79 by other medical specialists mainlypaediatricians and neurologists. Data on the reason of referral the pedi gree and clinical status as well as the outcome of testing were available for282. As no test result showed an equivocal repeat size direct mutationanalysis for myotonic dystrophy can be considered as a very accurate andspecific test to differentiate normal and disease associated alleles. Therewere 200 diagnostic investigations on symptomatic patients (103 abnor mal) 78 presymptomatic tests (16 abnormal 62 normal) and 4 prenataldiagnosis (2 abnormal 2 normal). In 117 symptomatic patients with a neg ative family history only 33 proved to have the mutation reflecting the lackof specificity of clinical symptoms in myotonic dystrophy. A normal resultwas also found in 9 out of 77 symptomatic patients with a positive familyhistory. Only 7 of the 16 individuals with an abnormal presymptomatic testresult showed no clinical abnormality on examination supporting the highpenetrance of the myotonic dystrophy mutation by adult life and indicating the importance of careful clinical assessment in relation to presymptomatictesting. ,2001
640,We report on a 3 year old female patient with a de novo inverted duplica tion of the distal segment of the short arm of chromosome 4 correspondingto the following karyotype 46 XX dup(4)(p15.3 16.3). This leads to a par tial trisomy 4p(15.3 16.3). Most striking clinical findings are microcephaly deep set eyes short pug nose full cheeks low set hairline bilateral simi an crease as well as clinodactyly of upper and lower limbs and a psy chomotor retardation (being able to sit with 12 months and to walk with 24186 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologymonths) with no speech development so far. Facial appearance is some what coarse as was already described for 4p duplications. The propositadescribed here shows some similarities to MPS I patients resulting in astorage disease like facial expression. It is interesting in this context thatthe IDUA (alpha L iduronidase) gene is mapped to this duplicated regionand could be responsible for some of those facial abnormalities. Thedevelopment of this facial appearance will have to be documented for along time evaluation and also biochemical studies of enzyme activity willbe achieved. A precise breakpoint characterization by high resolution chro mosome banding whole chromosome painting as well as by using sitespecific YAC probes was performed. No deletion but a duplication of thevery distal Wolf Hirschhorn critical region was demonstrated. A phenotype genotype correlation analysis in combination with an extensive literaturereview was undertaken to allow a further delineation of partial trisomy 4p. ,2001
641,A case is presented with the clinical picture of the Mercedes Benz syn drome characterised by premature closure of the lambdoid sutures andthe posterior part of the sagital suture. As far as we know no patients withMercedes Benz syndrome are reported in the literature with a mutation inone of the fibroblast growth factor receptor genes causing craniosynosto sis. Mutation analysis in our patient revealed a mutation in the FGFR2gene previously described in 2 Crouzon families. The clinical phenotype ofthose patients was not described however the Crouzon syndrome is knownto have a very variable expression. Our hypothesis is that the MercedesBenz syndrome is a variant of Crouzon syndrome. Mutation analysis inother patients diagnosed as having the Mercedes Benz Syndrome is pend ing. ,2001
642,Excepting in the cases of hematologic diseases (e.g. leukemia) transloca tions involving chromosomes of the groups A and C are relatively uncom mon especially among the chromosomes 2 and 12. Turner syndrome(TS) not rarely can be associated to others aberrations involving autoso mal chromosomes or even situations of reciprocal translocation betweenthe chromosome X and other autosomal. However until moment no caseof TS was reported associated to a translocation 2 12. We report the caseof a seven years old girl with severe mental retardation short stature microcephaly up slanting palpebral fissures epicanthal folds low set andposteriorly rotated ears with mild microtia anteverted nares short and flatphiltrum narrow palate pectus excavatum hypoplastic nipples shortbroad neck with low hairline brachydactyly with short four to fivemetacarpals bilaterally palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis increased skinpigmentation in all lower part of the body anteriorly placed anus andhypoplasia of genitals. Among others clinical and laboratorial investiga tions we detach the normal hematologic evaluation and the karyotype45 X inv(9)(p11q12)t(2 12)(q23 q24). Parent s karyotypes were normal. Asnor all the features observed in the patient can be referred to TS a revi sion of the clinical picture and of the chromosomal aberrations involvedwas done and discussed. ,2001
643,Proteus syndrome (PS MIM 176920) is a rare congenital hamartomatoussyndrome comprising hemihypertrophy asymmetrical overgrowth of differ ent parts of the body in association with various cutaneous abnormalities and subcutaneous masses. We report the clinical data of three unrelatedpatients with normal intelligence. All parents were healthy and unrelated. Patient 1 a 28 year old pregnant women third child of 36 years old par ents at birth showed hypertrophy of right leg. Examination demonstratedrightsided hemihypertrophy face asymmetry gigantic right 2nd finger andleft 2nd toe broad foot with deep creases on the soles soft tissue tumor on the right knee varicose veins cutis marmorata. Ultrasound examinationat 26 weeks of gestation was normal. Patient 2 was first seen as infantbecause of macrocephaly hemihypertrophy and cutaneous hemangiomas. At 9 years of age she showed macrocephaly (OFC 60.5) hyperostosis ofthe skull severe asymmetry of the face broad depressed nasal bridge hypertrophy of the right half of the tongue cutaneous hemangiomas hepatosplenomegaly rightsided hemihypertrophy right arm and leg werelonger than the left. Patient 3 at birth demonstrated hemihypertrophy.

644,CMTX is an X linked dominant hereditary motor sensory neuropathy withslow nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Affected males exhibit a moderateto severe phenotype whereas females usually have a mild neuropathy. The course of the disease is progressive over many years but does notdecrease lifespan. CMTX is associated with Cx32 mutations in mostcases. Cx32 maps to Chromosome Xq13 and codes for a Gap junctionbeta 1 protein which is found in central and peripheral myelin. Wesequenced the whole Cx32 coding region contained in one single exon ofa female index patient. Thereby we identified a novel deletion of 14 bp comprising nucleotides 829 to 843. Family history revealed X linked dom inant inheritance in the three generation family with 5 affected males and5 obligate carriers. Onset of clinical symptoms in affected persons waswithin the second decade of life with gradual progression. The mutation829 del 14 bp is associated with a highly variable degree of clinical involve ment in female carriers. ,2001
645,Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is a disorder of chromosome 15. The cardi nal features are neonatal and infantile central hypotonia improving withage feeding problems in infancy excessive weight gain between 1 and 6years of age generalised obesity hypogonadism hyperphagia develop mental delay. The most common serious complication is NIDDM. We pres ent a patient with PWS where diagnosis is confirmed by FISH techniquefirst in Latvia. The proband is the second child in the family born at 36weeks of gestation (weight 2900g height 50 cm). Till 3rd months of life hewas tube fed had hypotonia and poor weight gain was till 1 5 years after wards rapid gain with excessive weight. At the age 11 appeared fatty liversymptoms. At the examination proband (13 years old) had many clinicalfindings characteristic for PWS general obesity (106 kg) height 154 cm hypogonadism small hands and foot strabismus myopia speech articu lation defects thick saliva. He had moderate mental retardation and sleepdisturbances. Standard chromosome analysis on cultured lymphocytes(GTG banding) revealed changes of 15(q11q13) after with FISH techniquethe microdeletion was confirmed. It was the first time in Latvia when FISHis used to find out microdeletion. ,2001
646," ', 'To Frau Dorothea Buchberger and Dr. Robert Buchberger St. Petersburg isa city of about 4.5m of citizens. The number of babies with congenitalanomalies was 123 150 per 10 000 births (1986 1997). To identify allcases of malformed infants and fetuses is complex intricate long termprocess. Data observed are very responsible and BDM must be done cor rectly. Are our physicians well educated in this field? This question is theaim of this study. Materials methods. 194 of the physicians (gynecologists obstetricians 50% micropediatricians 12% pediatricians 32% differentspecialists 6%) were interviewed with the help of 3 questionnaires. Thefirst questionnaire contains 4 positions focused on monitoring. There arePosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 18712 specific terms for phenotype description in the second. The third ques tionnaire includes 50 questions associated closely with medical geneticsand dysmorphology. Results. The first and the second questionnairesdemonstrate unsatisfactory knowledge of human genetics and dysmor phology. The mean marks of the both tests were below 50 %. 4 out of 12terms are absolutely unknown. All doctors think that BDM is very importantproject and deals with medical genetics. Nobody says that he (she) is welleducated in these medical fields. All doctors consider that it is necessaryto have special short training course before their participation in BDM. Thegenetic basis of BDM the intensive free fortnight s course has beenorganized by our Department but only 19 doctors decided to use this luckychance. The main conclusion of this investigation consists in the fact thatBDM has weak basis for successful realization in St. Petersburg. ",2001
647,We report a newborn baby with Down syndrome caused by partial isochro mosome of chromosome 21q. The chromosomes of the baby were studiedbased on clinical findings such as low nasal bridge palmar simian creas es upslanting palpebral fissures loose skin of the neck and muscularhypotonia typical for Down syndrome. The karyotype of the baby turnedout to include a normal chromosome number but a partial isochromosome21q the karyotype was 46 XY i(21)(q22). FISH procedure using locus spe cific probe for band region 21q22.13 22.2 revealed one signal in the nor mal chromosome 21 and two signals in the isochromosome 21. Therefore the so far known critical region for Down syndrome was trisomic in thegenome of this baby. The chromosome analysis of the parents showed anormal karyotype for the father but an abnormal karyotype for the mothercontaining an inverted chromosome 21 the karyotype was46 XX inv(21)(p11.2q21). FISH procedure with the same locus specificprobe as mentioned above revealed only one specific signal in each chro mosome 21. The partial isochromosome 21q of this baby must have result ed through crossing over in the meiosis during gamete formation. Thiscase shows an elevated risk for Down syndrome for a carrier of an invert ed chromosome 21. In the near future the specific genes causing the phe notype of Down syndrome will be revealed and gene tests will help to con firm diagnosis also in these rare cases. ,2001
648,Goldberg Shprintzen syndrome (OMIM 235730) is a very rare genetic dis order an Autosomal Recessive mode of inheritance was suggested basedupon two sibs in one pedigree with unaffected parents and two consan guineous pedigrees. Common clinical features in reported subjects weresevere mental retardation microcephaly distinctive face and Hirschprung disease (HSCR). Coloboma of the iris and neurological abnormalities werenot always present submucous cleft palate was only reported by Goldbergand Shprintzen in the first description. We report the clinical data observedin three children (two females and one male) of consanguineous parents. The similarity of some clinical aspect to the phenotype of the Cornelia deLange syndrome seems very interesting. One further child is presentlybeing studied a young girl born to non consanguineous parents of unre lated families referred to our Centre for the molecular analysis of MECP2gene on the basis of a natural history apparently suggestive for Rett syn drome in this patient we didn t find mutations of the MECP2 coding region. We recently started a wide molecular genome screening in the first family for the identification of a Goldberg Shprintzen locus and we will presentthe preliminary results. ,2001
649,We report on a female newborn with a severe acute form of SMA con genital bone fractures camptodactyly of fingers and toes bilateral hip dis location and congenital heart defect with early lethal outcome. DNA stud ies showed the absence of homozygosity for a deletion of exons 7 and 8of the SMNt gene. A new lethal syndrome consisting of infantile spinalmuscular atrophy (SMA) and multiple congenital bone fractures in 2 sibshas been suggested in 1991. Recently another infant with a form of SMAand congenital fractures was reported thus validating the suggestion of adistinct and rare form of SMA associated with congenital bone fractures. Autosomal recessive inheritance was suggested in the original report butno history of consanguinity was noted in the second. X linked inheritancecould however not be excluded since those three affected infants weremale. Since our case is a female an X linked inheritance can be exclud ed. Since she was furthermore born to first cousin parents it suggests anautosomal recessive inheritance in this rare variant of SMA type 1 with con genital fractures. We further conclude that this SMA variant with earlylethal outcome is probably not linked to 5q. ,2001
650, freiburg.deIntroduction Robinow syndrome is a short stature syndrome with charac teristic facies mesomelic limb shortening and hypoplastic genitalia. Bothautosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have beenreported. The autosomal recessive cases seem to have more severebrachymelia and in addition digital anomalies and costovertebral segmen tation defect. The gene mutated in the autosomal recessive form has beenmapped to chromosome 9q22 a region that overlaps the locus for autoso mal dominant brachydactyly type B. Recently the ROR2 gene has beingidentified as mutated in brachydactylia type B and is regarded as a candi date gene for recessive Robinow syndrome. Reported mutations suggestthat a loss of activity of ROR2 causes recessive Robinow syndrome. Casereport We report on a 15 month old girl with classical Robinow Syndrome. The girl is the first child of healthy non consanguineous parents. The fam ily history is inconspicuous. Clinical examination of the father revealed a188 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologynotched tongue dental anomalies a preauricular tag on the left side clin odactyly II and V and a double mammilla on both sides. Clinical symptomsin the child include short arms and legs characteristic face with hyper telorism frontal bossing triangular mouth midface hypoplasia dentalabnormalities notched maxilla micrognathia and macrocephalus. In addi tion the girl had bilateral postaxial hexadactyly a symptom which has notbeen described in Robinow syndrome before. An X ray excluded a cos tovertebral segmentation defect. A chromosomal analysis showed a nor mal female karyotype. Mutation analysis of the ROR2 gene is in progress. Conclusions A literature review shows that this is the first case of RobinowSyndrome with hexadactyly. Microsymptoms of this syndrome in firstdegree relatives have not yet been described. Therefore we cannot decidewhether the polydactyly is indicative of dominant or recessive inheritance. It is not clear whether the symptoms in the father can be interpreted asmicrosymptoms of autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome. The lack ofcostovertebral segmentation defects in the child argues against autosomalrecessive inheritance. These questions will only be resolved by furthermolecular analysis of this syndrome. ,2001
651,TS is a sex chromosome aneuploidy with its incidence of about 1 3000 livefemale births in St. Petersburg. All of them are registered by Municipal Cen ter of Medical Genetics (MCMG) but they have constant health service attheir district out patient Department. The objectives of this study were (1)to summarize our patients data and (2) to determine their necessities. Weused self report survey methodology. The questionnaire was designed tosolicit information about the proband parents health and lifestyle habits. There are 69000 children aged from some days to 16 years under obser vation of policlinic endocrinologist. Eight of persons aged from 6 to 16years have TS. It is only the one case of TS recognized at the maternityhospital. The rest were not diagnosed till 6 13 years old. The parents of ourprobands are young in years (at the moment to conceive the mothers were22 25 years old and the fathers were 23 27). 50% of the couples reportedthat they had been exposed to environmental hazards. Data of the Cyto genetic Laboratory of MCMG are following 45 ?{4} 45 ?(30)/46 ??(8) 9ph 47 ???(60)/45 ?(40) 46 X del (X)(p11) 46 X del(X)(q10).The main prob lems of our respondents are financial difficulties problems of social reha bilitation and interpersonal communication. Sometimes they feel them selves like children neglected and forgotten. We suppose that it is neces sary to join hands with these families and organize special center for them. The best health service and social support of TS patients and their familiesmust become the principal purpose of this center ,2001
652,Modern medical genetics has begun to make a significant contribution tothe diagnosis of ophthalmology. This study accentuates the great impor tance of cooperation between an ophthalmologist and a medical geneticistto diagnose hereditary diseases. Four families with different rare hereditary diseases are under our observation. Goldmann Favre disorder (MIM268100) was diagnosed in 2 sisters aged 10 and 11 years and their moth er aged 32.This disorder is characterized by hyaloideoretinal degenerationwith retinoschisis and early hemeralopia. Stargardt disease juvenile mac ular degeneration (MIM 2482000) was observed in 2 unrelated families. There are 2 affected brothers with onset of this disease at 7 and 8 years inthe first family. We revealed a brother and a sister suffered from the same disorder in another family. All parents aren t affected. Crouzon disease craniofacial dysostosis (MIM123500) was diagnosed in a father aged 30years and his daughter aged 3 years. The disease is characterized bycranial synostosis hypertelorism bilateral exophthalmos external strabis mus and some other facial dysmorphic features. Both father and hisdaughter suffer from partial optic atrophy. To make a diagnosis and genet ic prognosis and to use an adequate treatment we apply special methodsof investigation suitable for ophthalmology and medical genetics. Now wecontinue to work on the pedigrees of our clients to reveal new cases or mildfeatures of the diseases among their relatives. Our cooperation improvesquality of health service and enriches our experience and erudition. ,2001

Growth failure mental retardation malformations clinical course vital prognosis are vari able. We present clinical data of two new patients with normal intelligenceand progeroid pictures. Patient 1 a 43 year old female looked healthy tillthe age of 38 years. She was married had a healthy son. Examinationshowed scoliosis reduction of subcutaneous tissue marked wrinkling skinof face and neck thinning greying hair heart failure. No cataracts diabetesmellitus were found. Decreased replicative life span of cultured skin fibrob lasts were revealed. Werner syndrome was suspected. Patient 2 a 18 year old girl (W=42kg H=155cm OFC=54cm) was born at term (G2 P2)with BW 3500g BL 52cm to unrelated healthy young parents. Her elderbrother was healthy. She looked normal at birth till the age of 6 years. Senility signs were noted in early childhood showing progressing but notHutchinson Gilford syndrome appearance. Short stature failure to thrive hypotrichosis bird face protruding eyes beaked nose progressive lossof subcutaneous tissue atrophic changes of skin and muscles thin limbswith scleroderma like lesions prominent joints flexion contractures hyper keratosis on the soles heart failure large abdomen hepatosplenomegaly diabetes mellitus diminished sexual development were observed at followup examinations.

654,Williams Beuren syndrome (WS) is a developmental disorder caused by ahemizygous microdeletion of ~1.5Mb at chromosomal location 7q11.23.Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare inherited condition disor der characterised by chronic and recurrent infection. In CGD the failure ofphagocytic cells to produce superoxide upon the ingestion of microorgan isms due to a lesion in a membrane associated NADPH oxidase leads toan enhanced susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections. Althoughdefects in the X chromosome linked cytochrome account for the majorityof CGD patients up to 35% are due to an autosomal recessive disease. Ofthese greater than 90% have been shown to be defective in the synthesisof a 47 kDa cytosolic component of the oxidase (p47 phox/NCF1 gene)mapping to the WS critical region at 7q11.23. We have identified a patientwith WS and CGD who has a molecular lesion in both copies of the NCF1gene. Molecular analysis of somatic hybrids from this patient showed thatthe NCF1 gene is encompassed within the WS deletion on one chromo some 7 homologue. PCR analysis of the genomic DNA using ARMSprimers specific for a common dinucleotide deletion (detected in ~90% ofp47 phox deficient CGD cases) at a GTGT tandem repeat in exon 2 iden tified this mutation in the NCF1 gene on the other chromosome 7 homo logue. The resulting frameshift leads to a premature stop codon furtherdownstream. This study describes the first case of a WS patient with CGDand provides an easy method for the rapid detection of CGD patientshomozygous for this common NCF1 mutation. ,2001
655,"The Meier Gorlin Syndrome (MGS) or Ear Patella Short stature syndrome(EPS MIM 224690) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterizedby the association of bilateral microtia a/hypoplasia of the patellae andsevere pre and postnatal growth retardation. Twenty one cases havebeen reported in literature thus far. Here we report on eight patients andcompare them with previously described cases. One of the present caseshad previously undescribed genital anomalies. There is a difference infacial characteristics between patients reported in early infancy and thosedescribed at older age follow up of patients is needed to substantiate thischanging facial phenotype. We recommend radiographic survey of thepatellae in patients at older age to investigate the weight of absent orhypoplastic patellae in the diagnosis of the syndrome. Based on the strik ing similarities of specific morphological skeletal findings Lacombe et al.(Ann Genet 1994 37 184 191) suggested that the MGS might be a humanequivalent to the short ear (se) murine disorder. The murine se phenotypeis caused by homozygous mutations in Bone Morphogenetic Protein 5(BMP 5). Molecular genetic studies including testing of candidate genes inMGS are presently being performed.

657,Septo optic dysplasia (SOD) is defined by a variable combination ofabsence of the septum pellucidum optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitaryanomalies. SOD is extremely rare in syndromes. Interestingly SOD hasbeen reported three times with digital anomalies suggesting amnioticbands. We report on another case with SOD similar digital anomalies and multiple angiomas. This girl was the first child of young healthy parents. Clinical examination at birth at 37 weeks of pregnancy (length 46 cm weight 2740g OFC 32 cm) revealed multiple angiomas plagiocephaly high forehead strabismus and horizontal nystagmus. Hands abnormali ties included bilateral hypoplasia of the fifth finger affecting the second andthird phalanx bilateral syndactyly of the fourth and fifth finger and a con striction on the first phalanx of the second left finger. She sat at 9 monthsof age and could not walk at 17 months of age. Height and weight were Ã¢\x80\x942 standard deviations. Investigations revealed SOD optic nerve hypopla sia normal chromosomes and isolated growth hormone deficiency. Thepathogenesis of SOD with digital anomalies is unknown. It is unlikely thatrandom phenomena could produce similar defects in all 4 patients. Allcases were sporadic and no parental consanguinity was known. Furtherreports will help delineating this association as a new entity. ,2001

They can be detected in a non mosaic state by conventional cytogenetic analysis in cells of different tis sues confirmation is carried out by FISH. The majority of i(18p)s originatesfrom maternal meiosis II followed by a postzygotic transverse centromeremisdivision. Children with tetrasomy 18p show consistent features sug gesting a characteristic phenotype. However the aberration is rare and theclinical picture remains unprecise and not well known. Published reportsmention psychomotor and mental retardation muscular hypertonia micro cephaly facial asymmetry high arched eyebrows epicanthus strabism short palpebral fissures small pinched nose prominent upper lip micro genia low set/malformed ears scoliosis/kyphosis long fingers with con tractures and feet malformations. To define the tetrasomy 18p phenotypemore precisely we collected data of 6 children with supernumerary i(18p)investigated in our institutions as well as 34 literature cases for which clin ical data were available. A frequency based spectrum of clinical andanthropological features is elaborated. Regarding the developmental andbehavioural phenotype the results of video analyses performed in three ofthe 6 children will be given. ,2001

660,Proteus Syndrome (PS) is a rare and complex hamartomatous condition characterized by overgrowth of multiple tissues with partial gigantism andasymmetry of the limbs and viscera connective tissue nevi hemangioma ta lipomata lymphangiomata epidermal nevi and hyperostoses. It is high ly variable and appears to affect patients in a mosaic manner. This couldexplain the significative variability and misdiagnosis. Usually it is confusedwith the Klippel Trenaunay syndrome hemihyperplasia with multiple lipo mas and other conditions. Herein we describe 3 girls all sporadic cases with the initial diagnosis of PS which were reviewed taking into accountthe diagnostic criteria proposed by Biesecker et al.[Am J Med Genet84 389 1999]. A routine clinical evaluation including dermatologic assess ment imaging studies with ultrasound plain skeletal radiographs and com puted tomography were performed. The first case was characterized by renal and lower limbs asymmetry which became worse with the evolution a lipoma and hyperchromic lesions appeared. Although she had not filledthe main diagnostic criteria and had lost the follow up the hypothesis ofPS was kept. The second case presented progressive overgrowth of thefeet hemangioma lipoma skin thickness and hyperpigmentation withcerebriform appearance of the soles confirming the diagnosis of PS feetamputation was required. The third patient presented overgrowth of thefoot comprising metatarsal region no other lesions were observed duringa 5 years follow up PS diagnosis was disregarded and the hypothesis ofisolated gigantism of the foot was considered. This report reinforces theneed of a multidisciplinary approach criterious evaluation and follow up onpatients with the initial diagnosis of PS. ,2001
661,.Birth Defects (BD) Prevention Alliances at regional (Alabama) National(Ukraine) and International levels (World Alliance of Non GovernmentalOrganizations for the Prevention of Birth Defects or WANGOPBD) providea basis for two generalizations and a recommendation. A broad definitionof BD as any structural or functional anomaly caused by genetic or envi ronmental factors that impact embryonal fetal and child developmentfacilitates communications with healthcare planners and providers. InUkraine such risk factors as chronic low dose ionizing radiation from theChornobyl disaster iodine poor soils low consumption of folic acid andhigh consumption of alcohol are then perceived as causes of BD. Empha sizing that mental retardation malformations congenital syphilis andchildhood cancers ofter are BD stresses the crucial role genetics and ter atology in public health. The idea that every child has the right to be bornfree from preventable BD generates strong empathy. This goal helped toforge BD Prevention Alliances linking a variety of parental support groupswith a variety of professionals and opinion makers. An Alliance confers aPosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 191stronger voice to what my have been a number of small advocacy groups. BD Alliances are strengthened by resource centers we call OmniBD Centers . The Centers offer a common ground shared by lay and pro fessional members. The main components are information materials tech nical and staff assistance conference facilities and access to the Web. ,2001
662,A pair of 16 years old monozygotic twins (MZ) with beta thalasemia wasstudied. The male twins were discordant for several dental anomalies ofpermanent dentition and concordant for a few genetic traits ABo bloodgroup system Rh blood group HLA haplotype and beta thalasemia. Onetwin showed a supernumerary tooth known as paramolar on the right max illary molar region and delayed eruption of permanent teeth the co twin hasnormal number of permanent teeth and timing of eruption. In their familythe anomalies of permanent teeth have been established only in theproband. Comparison between monozygotic twins have provided strongsupport for the idea that MZ do not share all their alleles they are geneti cally similar but not identical. Discordance of anomalies may reflect differ ences in developmental timing differences in susceptibility to one or moreteratogens or random events occuring within very complex programs ofteeth development. ,2001
663,Here we report on a 20 year old male patient with an complex combinationof phenotypic anomalies. He was born at term as the first child of a healthyunrelated couple following an uneventfull pregnancy by caesarian sectionbecause of macrocephaly OFC 37.5 cm (> 90 centile) birth weight 3.6 kgand length 52 cm. Facial dysmorphic findings as macrocephaly hyper telorism antimongoloid slant malformed protruding ears of normal size ashort nose with broad nasal bridge and full lips were noticed. He showsseveral additional anomalies like mental and growth retardation andanaemia. He currently is 156 cm tall (<< 3 centile) weight 52 kg (< 3 cen tile) and OFD of 62.5 cm (>> 97 centile). Cytogenetic analysis revealed aY 22 translocation with breakpoints on the short arm of both chromosomeswith no further anomalies. The karyotype 46 X (Y 22) (p11.2 p11.2) denovo was also confirmed by FISH analysis using whole chromosome paint ing and locus specific probes. Parental karyotypes are normal and pater nity was confirmed by microsatellite analysis. He does not show anomaliesof inner organs except a moderate hepatomegaly. Most of the standardlaboratory parameters are normal but anaemia is treated with EPO sincea few month successfully. Because no gene related to the phenotype ismapped to the chromosomal breakpoint at Yp11.2 and involvement of agenein22p11.2ishighlyunlikely we are now focussing on cloning the break point in Yp11.2 in an effort to approach the complex phenotype of the patientthat well may represent a new syndrome. ,2001
664,Williams syndrome is a well recognized but not fully understood neurode velopmental disorder involving both connective and central nervous sys tems. The distinctive cognitive profile may represent a prototype to unrav el the relationship between the genes and the behavior. In the present study we collected blood from 25 W. S children aged from 4months to 21 years. All cases were non familial while two patients weremonozygotic twins. All children underwent detailed clinical developmental cardiological neurological and laboratory investigation. Diagnosis wasconfirmed by FISH. Their follow up continued for five years. Molecularanalysis for the detection and the origin of deletions in all children and theirparents was performed using the intragenic polymorphic markers D7S613 D7S489B and D7S1870 .Our results showed a higher incidence of pul monary stenosis than what appears in the literature. Severe hypertensionwas noticed in more than half of our cases and caused selective abortionin a first trimester pregnancy. Another patient had severe hypertension dueto renal artery stenosis which led to brain hemorrhage and death. Hypera cousis was a consistent finding in our series of patients. According to the molecular analysis the pair of twins and 6 other cases had maternal dele tion and 2 cases had paternal deletion while the rest were either normal ornon informative. We could not demonstrate any relationship between thesize of the deletion and the phenotype. The absence of genes other thanelastin which probably contribute to the variability of the phenotyperemains to be determined. ,2001
665,Colobomatous Microphtalmia is a common malformation is anatomically clinically and etiologically a heterogenous disorder. Microphtalmia hasbeen reported in more than 150 syndromes with overlapping clinical find ings in association with chromosomal and monogenic traits. We report fivegirls from consanguinous Omani family with variable expression of multi ple congenital anomaly syndrome of Microcephaly ColobomatousMicrophtalmia Short Stature Severe Psychomotor Retardation Congeni tal Heart Defects and 46 XX karyotype. Molecular analysis is currently inprogress for better understanding this Syndrome. Detailed clinical findingsand literature review will be presented. ,2001
666,Congenital generalized myofibromatosis (CGF) is a rare condition charac terized by widespread firm nodules in the skin muscles bones and inter nal organs. Histologically the lesions consist of cells which have both mus cle and fibroblast characteristics. Etiology of CGF is unknown. Most casesare sporadic and are not associated with other malformations and/or men tal retardation. Exceptional familial cases compatible with autosomalrecessive or dominant inheritance have been reported. Only two patientshave been described with CGF and associated birth defects (Spraker etal. J Am Acad Dermatol 1984 10 365 371 Michel et al. Eur J Pediatr1990 149 251 252). We report a third patient with CGF and congenitalmalformations. The newborn female was the only child of non consan guineous parents. The mother had congenital unilateral cataract. Deliveryoccurred at 41 weeks of gestation after an uneventful pregnancy. Birthmeasurements were in the normal range. Examination in the neonatal peri od revealed facial dysmorphism (coarse face epicanthic folds longphiltrum macrostomia) a posterior cleft palate and a malplaced anus. Inaddition numerous (approx. 50) subcutaneous firm nodules varying indiameter from 0.2 4 centimeters were found scattered over the wholebody. Histopathological examination of one nodule allowed the diagnosisof CGF. Echocardiography showed multiple intramyocardial round struc tures as well as a small perimembranous ventricular septal defect. Xraysrevealed a clavicular pseudarthrosis and multiple lytic lesions of longbones. Blood and skin karyotypes were 46 XX. Despite treatment withinterferon vincristine and actinomycine the child died at the age of 3months of respiratory failure. Autopsy confirmed the widespread involve ment of muscles bones and internal organs. Given the probably non ran dom recurring association of CGF with various congenital malformationsand the familial occurence of some cases one can postulate that this con dition is most likely caused by a mutation in a (yet unknown) gene actingvery early in development and cell differentiation. ,2001
667,Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva FOP) is a condition described cen turies ago but exact pathogenetic mechanism is still not well understood. FOP is characterized by ectopic soft tissue calcification that progressesalways in the same direction from cranial o caudal. Neck spine and shoul 192 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyders are described as most common sites for this heterotopic ossification. The second feature of FOP is malformed great toe which leads to properdiagnosis early after appearance of the first swellings. Most of the casesare sporadic but in some families autosomal dominant inheritance isdescribed. Some authors suggest that mutations in the bone morpho genetic protein 4 gene or it s promotor are responsible for ossification inthe abnormal tissues. The first case is a girl which is the first child of unre lated parents. Swellings 4 at a time appeared at the age of 2 months atthe dorsal occipital region and neck. The size of these swellings was dif ferent 1 3cm. The child had typical short and malformed great toes alsominor coxal congenital dysplasia. Biopsy of the tissue was performed toexclude malignancy and the presence of normal fibroblasts fibrocytes andcollagen fibers were found. These swellings started to resolve severalmonths later with just a slight reminiscence of them. The time will showwhether it is a phase of remissions or a different condition. The secondpatient is a 7 year old boy with ectopic calcifications first found in theshoulders and consequently the disease proceeded along the spine andthe arms. The appearances of the swellings were painful and the childdeveloped restricted mobility of the arms and spine in a period of a fewyears. Additional malformations were present one phalangeal short greatthumb and fused cervical vertebrae. Both of the children had no positivefamily history. None of the family members in the two families had abnor mal or short thumbs. We can conclude that two of the cases were sporadic representing a fresh mutation of the disease. ,2001
668,Chromosome 22q11 deletion causes DiGeorge syndrome velocardiofacialsyndrome (VCFS) and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. Cardiac out flow malformations are frequently main findings of these syndromes. Theaim of this study was to determine the incidence of 22q11 deletion in chil dren with conotruncal heart defects and to evaluate additional dysmorphicfindings in these patients. Cardiac catheterization had been performed in30 patients (age 3 days 9 years) with conotruncal heart defects. Thepatients were also examined by a pediatrician and clinical geneticist. Theirblood samples were obtained for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)analysis with LSI DiGeorge/VCFS region probe. Cardiologic diagnosis ofthem were as follows tetralogy of Fallot 7 cases double outlet right ven tricle 8 cases transposition of the great arteries 8 cases truncus arterio sus 3 cases other conotruncal defects with malalignment ventricular sep tal defect 4 cases. Twenty children were found to be dysmorphic. FISHanalysis of these 20 patients demonstrated 22q11 deletion in 7 cases. Onlytwo patients without dysmorphic features had 22q11 deletion. In this study the details of conotruncal heart defects and dysmorphic findings of ourpatients were presented. ,2001
669,XXY occurs 1 500 & the facets of the neurodevelopmental(ND)profile ofthe young child with XXY have not been well desribed in a large sample. There were 52 subjects with XXY prenatally diagnosed. ComprehensiveND assessments were completed using standardized tools to determinethe level of functioning in the five areas of development. The mean agewas 13m(r=2 48m). Parents were well educated with 25% having post graduate degrees. Data was segregated and analyzed using Hottellings t test at p<.05 level. Speech(EL=85.7[sd=12.8] p<.001)& motor(PDI=88.46[sd=12.39] p<.001)delays were significant with normalcognition(MDI= 97.6[sd=12.8]). 50% of the boys had abnormal muscletonus in the trunk & extremeties. This profile is highly suggestive of aninfantile presentation of developmental dyspraxia(IDD) a motor planning disorder with speech motor and attention conmpromised. This large studyon XXY who were prenatally diagnosed reveals an infantile presentation ofa learning disorder which may be an predictive of an increased risk for edu cational difficulties. Further follow up will determine the incidence of learn ing disablilties and the predictive factors from these early findings. Prena tal counseling with families should discuus the possibility IDD normal cog nition and need for EI evaluation that are focused on specific weaknesses. This study further defines the natural history of a sex chromosome disor der in early childhood years. Further studies are warranted to investigate ifthere are any correlations between ND performance and parental origin ofthe additional X. Studies investigating the relationship between skewed X inactivation and the ND profile of boys with XXY may further clarify the vari ability of function in boys with XXY. ,2001
670,Congenital absence of the vas deferens is an uncommon anomaly thatmay effect male fertility. About 1 5% of infertile men have bilateral congen ital absence of vas deferens. Advances in genetics and the advent ofreproductive techniques have revolutionized the aspect of the reproductivepotential of these men. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications ofgenomic DNA was used to amplify each of the CFTR exons and their flank ing regions. Four common CFTR gene mutations were assayed (Ã\x98F508 1677 D TA Poly T M470V). To elucidate other urogenital anomalies andCFTR mutations that accompany the absent of vas deferens we report 60azoospermic men and 1 asthenoteratospermic man with unilateral or bilat eral absence of vas deferens. Sixty one patients with unilateral or bilateralabsence of vas deferens applied to our IVF clinic due to male factor infer tility between 1996 1999. Mean age of the patients were 34.4Ã¢\x80\x935 8 (S. D.) and mean infertility time was 8.5Ã¢\x80\x935.3 years. Major urogenital anomalies ofvas deferens seminal vesicle and epididiymal anomalies were detected. No DTA nad Poly T mutations were detected in our patient population.Ã\x98F508 mutation was detected in 4% and M470V mutation was detected in13% of patients. Twenty four patients underwent sperm retrieval procedurefor intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 7 MESA 12 PESA 3 TESA and2 TESE procedure were carried out. The number of sperm retrieved withthese procedures were between 20.000/mL and 15million/mL differentiat ing according to the type of procedure. Thirty four patients have a historyof previous scrotal exploration and testicular biopsy. Reevaluation of thesepreparations revealed 14 normospermatogenesis 7 hipospermatogenezis 9 complete or incomplete maturation arrest and 1 tubular hyalinization. Other urogenital anomalies are common for men with unilateral or bilater al absence of vas deferens. CFTR gene mutations which are known to befrequent among these patients could not be detected in our patient group. Vasal agenezis can occur without evidence of CFTR defects. Spermretrieval from these patients is almost always possible for assisted repro ductive techniques. ,2001
671,"The diagnosis of Rett Syndrome prior to the availability of mutation analy sis by sequencing the MECP2 gene was based on rigid clinical criteria females who had normal development until 6 18 months of age with sub sequent regression characterized by loss of speech and loss of purposefuluse of hands microcephaly seizures autistic behavior ataxia hyperven tilation and stereotypic hand movements. 4 patients (16 4 3.5 3 yearsold) who were found to have a MECP2 mutation exhibited an inconstantphenotype with incomplete clinical criteria all (4/4) had regression follow ing normal initial development with loss of speech and stereotypic handmovements (2/4) seizures (2/4) loss of walking (0/4) microcephaly (2/4)autistic behavior (2/4) ataxia and (1/4) hyperventilation. The absence ofmicrocephaly resulted in delay of diagnosis in 3/4 of the patients becausea number of physicians felt that microcephaly was a requisite criterion. While additional patients will be necessary to fully appreciate the changingphenotype of Rett Syndrome the diagnosis should be considered andMECP2 gene sequencing for mutation analysis done when a developmen tally delayed female had normal early development followed by regressionwith the loss of speech especially in the presence of stereotypic handmovements.

672,Goldenhar syndrome is an entity classified into the facio auriculo vertebral(FAV) spectrum. Although the inherited pattern is uncertain there are sev eral reports with dominant and recessive autosomal traits. X linkedichthyosis (XLI) is an entity characterized by dark regular adherent scalesof skin on abdomen neck back and extremities. XLI is due to the defi ciency of the steroid sulfatase enzyme (STS). The STS gene is located onXp22.3. Most XLI patients present large deletions of the STS gene andflanking sequences. We report a 25 year female with clinical characteris tics of the FAV spectrum and her son of 7 years of age with XLI. To estab lish XLI diagnosis STS activity was determined in leukocytes using 7 [3H] dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate as a substrate. It was also performedamplification of both extremes of the STS gene by PCR and FISH analysisof the STS gene. STS activity was undetectable in the patient (0.00pmol/mg protein/h) and very low in the mother (0.35 pmol/mg protein/h vs0.79 pmol/mg protein/h of the normal control). No amplification of the 5and 3 ends of the STS gene were observed in the patient. FISH analysis was positive for XLI in the patient and for XLI carrier in the mother. FAVspectrum has been associated with several entities but this is the firstreport in the literature in which FAV spectrum and XLI are present in thesame family ,2001
673,Several progeroid disorders of childhood onset have been reported. Among them a specific type presenting as an old man appearance sincebirth was named as neonatal progeroid syndrome(NPS). Since the firstcase of NPS(Am J Med Genet 1995 69 195 6) another 4 neonates withsimilar features were found in Taiwan. They all have progeroidface( pinched appearance with hypoplasia of the lower half of the face) prominent scalp veins frontal bossing small beaked nose and severegrowth retardation. Thorough endocrinological and metabolic investiga tions were performed in those patients and the results disclosed hypothy roidism or hyperthyrotrophinemia(4/5) very low level of insulin like growthfactor I(3/5) hypolipidemia(4/5) and a specific organic aciduria(2/5). Theassociated anomalies included laryngomalacia(4/5) cardiac defects(2/5) neonatal teeth(2/5) congenital glaucoma and achondroplasia(1/5) andcontractural arachnodactyly in all patients. The karyotyes wre all normal. However chromosomal breakage test showed markedly increased break age rates in 3 patients suggesting the role of DNA repair defects in such premature ageing disorders. More than one disease may account for the clinical variability of neonatal progeroid disorders. ,2001
674,"Auditory pigmentary syndromes are caused by the absence ofmelanocytes from the skin hair eyes or stria vascularis of the cochlea. Examples with patchy depigmentation are Waardenburg syndromes (WS)which are usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Type 1Waardenburg syndrome (WS I) is caused by heterozygous loss of functionmutations in the PAX3 gene. Klein Waardenburg syndrome (WS III) is avery rare condition and represents an extreme presentation of WS 1 withadditional extremity abnormalities. We present a 4 year old Turkish childwith typical features of Klein Waardenburg syndrome including dystopiacanthorum partial albinism hearing impairment and upper limb defects. The child was born to a consanguineous marriage and both parents wereaffected with WS I. We screened the entire coding region of the PAX3gene for mutations and identified a novel missense mutation Y90H inexon 2 of PAX3 gene within the paired box domain. Both parents with WS I were heterozygous for the mutation and the child with WS III washomozygous. This is the second report of a homozygous PAX3 mutationcausing the WS III phenotype. Homozygous PAX3 mutations in theSplotch mouse a mouse model of Waardenburg syndrome have lethalneural tubes defects but we could not observe any neural tube abnormal ity in our patient. Clinical and molecular analysis in 4 additional Turkishfamilies with WS 1 showed the clinical variability of the WS I phenotypeamong and within WS I families. Further we have identified 4 novel muta tions in the PAX3 gene in these families.194 Posters: Clinical Genetics and DysmorphologyP0489. Clinical description of a new patient with de novo par tial trisomy 7q identified by SKY A. B. Caliebe1 M. Kautza1 J. I. Martin Sobero1 A. Holthausen2 R. Siebert1 W. Grote1 1Department of Human Genetics Kiel Germany 2Neuropediatric Hospital Kiel G', ' kiel.deThe male proband was first seen at the age of six months because ofdevelopmental delay and facial dysmorphism. He had progressive macro cephaly dysplastic deep set ears depressed nasal root and antevertednares. There were genital anomalies (undescended right testis hypoplas tic scrotum hypospadia glandis and a micropenis). The boy exhibited cen tral strabism. Head control had not been achieved at that time he smiledsince the eighth week and had just learned to transfer objects from onehand to the other. The propositus is the second child of healthy non con sanguineous parents born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. Chromosome analysis on peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed addition al chromosome material on the distal part of the long arm of one chromo some 11 in 20 metaphases analysed. The parentsÃ¢\x80\x98 karyotypes were nor mal. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) suggested the material of unknown originattached to chromosome 11 to be derived from chromosome 7. FISH withwhole chromosome painting probes for chromosomes 7 and 11 confirmedaddition of chromosome 7 material to chromosome 11 due to an unbal anced translocation t(7 11). According to the G banding pattern the frag ment of chromosome 7 translocated to chromosome 11 comprised the dis tal part of the long arm from 7q34 to 7qter. Pure partial trisomy 7q has sofar rarely been described. Macrocephaly dysplastic pinnae micropenis and undescended testis in boys and moderate till profound retardationseem to be features of this syndrome. When re evaluated at the age of thir teen months head control had been achieved and the propositus could rollover. ",2001
675,A 35 year old male was referred for fertility treatment. Semen analysisrevealed a teratozoospermia. Apart from the wish for fertility treatment thepatient wanted to be informed on the risk of transmitting his hand and footabnormalities to his possible progeny. The abnormalities consisted of splithand/split foot on the left side a hypoplastic 5th ray of the right hand anda hypoplastic 1st ray of the right foot with a small cleft between the first andsecond ray. His medical record further revealed several surgical correc tions of a glandular hypospadias and eye abnormalities which consisted ofa complete iriscoloboma of the left eye in an atypical position (cranio tem poral) and a coloboma of the papilla in the right eye. So the hand foot andeye abnormalities appear to be more severe on the left side. Family histo ry revealed no abnormalities which could be related to the findings in ourpatient. The symptoms appear different from those described in Hand Foot Genital Syndrome moreover an iriscoloboma would not fit in thisdiagnosis. Since split hand/split foot can be caused by mutations in the p63gene mutation analysis of this gene was performed. However sequencingof the majority of the exons did not reveal a mutation. So far we do nothave a diagnosis or an explanation for this malformation complex. In coun selling this patient we felt we could not exclude a recurrence risk of 50%for his progeny. ,2001

We performed medical genetic examination in 54 children sfamilies with congenital stridor in the Clinic of Reconstruction Surgery ofLarynx and Trachea for Children of Sechenov s Moscow Medical Academywith the aim of specification of hereditary background and its influence onthe clinical picture and on the results of the treatment. The age of the chil dren at the moment of entering to the clinic was from 21 days to 3years. We performed to every child the examination of larynx during direct micro laryngoscopy and tracheoscopy. The diagnosis of laryngomalacia wasdetermined in 30 patients the paralysis of vocal folds in 10 laryngeal cyst in 5 congenital laryngeal membrane in 3 tracheomalacia Ã¢\x80\x94 in 6. Syn dromological diagnosis (Aarskog Ehlers Danlos Pierre Robin Noonan Weaver and Down syndromes) was found in 7 (13.0 %) patients. The iso lated defect of larynx without manifestation from other organs and systemswere found in 12 (22.2 %) patients. The rest 35 patients (64.8 %) had thecombination of development organ s defects in several systems notinducted by one another which are possible to mark as multitude congen ital defects of development. So the medical genetic examination is maybe necessary part of the preoperative preparation of children with congen ital stridor. ,2001
678,Only few cases of associations of esophageal atresia with anophtalmiahave been observed since Rogers in 1988. We report on the seventh case. At birth this girl presented with these two malformations. Her face lookeddysmorphic pear shaped with a large forehead and a small chin. In pro file her nasal root was not very well marked and her nucha was smooth. The ears seemed to be low implanted and her front fontanel was verysmall with overlapping sutures. Her chromosome testing on leukocytesand fibroblasts was normal. On the fourth day of her life she died of gen eral failure. Post mortem necropsy confirmed complete bilateral anoph talmia and type III esophageal. There were no other malformations. To ourknowledge this observation is the 7th case of anophtalmia andesophageal atresia association. Moreover among males external genitalsabnormalities are described. SHAH proposed to call this associationAnophtalmia Esophageal Genital syndrome (AEG syndrome). All of thecases whose pictures has been published presented a similar dysmorphicface. As regards embryology those two malformations appear at the samemoment of embryonic life. There are as in hypospadias a midline abnor mality. The homogeneous character of those seven reported cases and thefact that they are midline abnormalities plead in favor of a genetic origin. Some genes are known to be responsible for anophtalmia in animals Eye less 1 and 2 in the mouse and ANOP 1 and 2 in the rat. In our patient nomutation of SIX 3 gene (the human equivalent of the animal Eyeless) wasfound. ,2001
679,Adams Oliver Syndrome (OMIM 100300) also reported as CongenitalScalp Defects with distal limb reduction anomalies is a rare genetic disor der transmitted as Autosomal Dominant Trait. We report two new unrelat ed cases both males a newborn and a young boy aged 8 years referredto our Centre for a genetic evaluation. Two major features suggested usthe diagnosis scalp and limbs defects. Scalp defect represented byPosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 195extensive aplasia cutis of the scalp affecting the cranial vault without an underlying defect of skull bone was present at birth in both patients withprogressive spontaneous healing. The degree of limbs anomalies is differ ent in the two childrens. Duplication of first finger with very short phalangesand small or absence of fingers and toes nails were obvious in the new born short distal phalanges and small toenails represent the limb defectsin the young boy. Other clinical features characteristic of Adams Oiliversyndrome were also present in both patients mild mental retardationincluded in the eight years old boy. We consider important to report thesenew cases of Adams Oliver Syndrome because it is a rare genetic disor der with variable clinical expression but well distinct from other syn dromes sharing some of the clinical features first of all scalp and limbsdefects associated with chromosomal abnormalities transmitted asMendelian traits or apparently caused by non genetic factors. ,2001
680,Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are clinically charac terised by progressive cerebellar ataxia with an onset usually after child hood. Based on additional clinical characteristics and age of onset Hard ing suggested a classification of ADCAs in type I II and III. Genetic map ping studies in ADCA families have detected fourteen genetic loci (SCA 1 8 and SCA 10 15) and nine of the corresponding genes have already beencloned. ADCA type II is characterised by progressive pigmentary maculardegeneration in association with cerebellar ataxia and is caused by pato logical repeat expansions (37 to 306 repeats) in the SCA7 gene. The rarelydocumented infantile SCA7 phenotype characterised by additional extra neurological manifestations and a rapid progressive course is due toenormous repeat expansions on paternal disease transmission. We reportupon a family in which the onset of ataxia and subsequent detection of theSCA7 muation in the proband retrospectively explained the fatal illnessresulting in early death in two children. Post mortem analysis of the SCA7gene in the offspring revealed repeat expansions of 325 and 460 repeats the largest ever reported. We discuss the infantile SCA7 phenotype andcomment on the problems encoutered in differential diagnosis and geneticcounseling. ,2001
681,The goal of our study was to follow the prevalence of the heart diseases the type of heart malformations in genetic diseases and their influence onthe infantile morbidity and mortality in Bihor County Romania. Material andMethod The study included 361 patients with an average age of 8.80+( )5.30 with limits 1 day 20 years presenting genetic disorders with possibleheart involvement. Results Heart involvement of the genetic diseases wasfound in 134 (37.11%) patients from which 44 (32.84%) cases survivedand 90(67.16%) cases died 123(91.7%) patients presented congenitalheart diseases with left right shunt in 10 (2.77%) patients progressiveheart involvement being present. Heart abnormalities with left right shuntwere more frequent and severe in chromosomal abnormalities (104 cases 76.61%). They represented determinant cause for decease in 36 (26.86%)cases by irreducible heart failure and favoring cause for decease in 30(23.38%) cases. Conclusions The vital prognosis of the chromosomalgenetic diseases is influenced by the presence of congenital heart dis eases especially by the lesions on left right shunt type. They representdeterminant and favoring cause of the infantsÃ¢\x80\x98 decease. ,2001
682,Recently a dysmorphogenetic syndrome featuring adducted thumbs clubfeet and distinctive facial dysmorphism was first distinguished in twocousins of a large consanguineous Turkish family. We report two male sibswith the same condition the product of a fourth cousin marriage of an Aus trian family. The patients presented with facial dysmorphism comprisingbroad and bossed forehead widely patent anterior fontanel telecanthus downslanting palpebral fissures deep set ears arachnodactyly severelyadducted thumbs and clubfeet. Our observations confirm that the adduct ed thumb clubfoot syndrome most likely represents a distinct autosomalrecessively inherited phenotype. ,2001
683,Although autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested as the ori gin of caudal regression most cases are sporadic or associated with196 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologymaternal diabetes. Classically the spectrum includes imperforate anus sacral agenesis and sirenomelia. To the best of our knowledge the asso ciation of holoprosencephaly and caudal dysgenesis in a child who doesnot have a well known syndrome has been described only in two unrelat ed children. In this work we describe a family in which holoprosencephalyassociated with caudal dysgenesis in the first child is recurring in the fetusof the present gestation. The propositus a male infant was born of young healthy and non consanguineous parents with no family history of similarbirth defects. The pregnancy was complicated by influenza in the firsttrimester. The baby weighed 1050 g and died after 15 minutes. He pre sented alobar holoprosencephaly severe ocular hypotelorism proboscide microstomia solitary left renal cyst anus imperforate hemivertebra in L2 hypoplasia of iliac irregularities in all middle phalanges of the fingers andsacral agenesis. His karyotype was normal (46 XY). Six months afterpropositus s birth the mother became pregnant. A 20 weeks prenatal ecog raphy also showed holoprosencephaly and sacral agenesis. The recur rence of the same pattern in sibs in the present family suggests a syn dromic picture probably from autosomal recessive origin. ,2001
684,During the past few years in several forms of behavioral phenotypes suchas Prader Willi Williams and Smith Magenis syndrome (S M sy) chro mosomal microdeletion has been confirmed by FISH method in our depart ment. Only one of them Smith Magenis syndrome (deletion 17p11.2 ) hasbeen shown to be associated with self injurious behavior mild dysmor phism and various neurologic signs. According to this characteristics in ourpatient the first investigation was aimed to metabolic disease exlusion. Themale child aged 2 was reffered to geneticist because of psychomotoricretardation and stereotypy in behaviour of unclear etiology. Hypotonia fail ure to thrive sleeping problems and delopmental delay was evident fromthe beginning. The self injurious behaviour was manifested at the age of20 months. Other features included plagiocephaly cerebral cortex atrophy coloboma of optic disk telecanthus protruding tongue poor dentition thinmarmorate skin with ligament laxity and decreased sensitivity to pain. Therecognition patterns of behavioral phenotypes in different age categoriesenabled us to confirm the diagnosis in early infancy. ,2001
685,We report a girl with congenital skeletal changes severe neurologicaldeficit and dysmorphic features. At birth she was noted to be hypotonic andhave dysmorphic features (midface hypoplasia hypertelorism long palpe bral fissures and low posteriorly rotated ears among others). Her radiolog ical findings were characteristically metaphyseal widening cupping flaringand splaying rhizomelic shortening of both upper and lower limbs andabnormally shaped talus and calcaneous. These features were consistentwith spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Ã¢\x80\x94 Sedaghatian type. Spondylometa physeal dysplasia Ã¢\x80\x94 Sedaghatian type is a lethal skeletal dysplasia andthere are no cases reported in the literature that have survived beyond theage of 160 days. Our patient survived to the age of four years. During herlifetime she was severely developmentally delayed and over time devel oped seizures and other neurological sequelae. We believe this case is ofinterest as it charts the natural history of this rare disorder. ,2001
686,We present an undescribed reccurent lethal chondrodysplasia associatedwith microcephaly distal arthrogryposis biliary anomalies and midlinedefects in four patients belonging to two unrelated kindred. The four casespresented short limbs with hands and feet malposition narrow thorax microcephaly retrognathism and similar visceral anomalies. Skeletal radi ological anomalies were similar shortness of long bones with wide meta physes skull ischio pubic rami and vertebrae s lack of ossification round ed aspect of iliac wings flare clavicles costal anomalies and short first metacarpal. In family 1 they were two girls of non consanguineous par ents. Case one was diagnosed as a unclassified chondrodysplasia punc tata because of carpal and tarsal punctuations and died at 2 days of life ofheart failure. For case 2 the pregnancy was interrupted at 25 gestationalweeks in front of prenatal findings suggesting a recurrence. Autopsyrevealed corpus callosum agenesis pulmonary malsegmentation inter ventricular septal defect biliary fibroadenomatous and didelphis uterus. Standard karyotype were normal. In family 2 they were two female fÃ\x87tus es for whom pregnancy was interrupted at 26 and 25 gestational weeks. Parents were consanguineous. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed shortlimbs malposition of hands and feet narrow thorax microcephaly and cor pus callosum anomalies. Autopsy confirm these findings and revealed liverand biliary anomalies for both. To our knowledge this type of lethal chon drodysplasia had never been described and we suggest that thesepatients present a new lethal polymalformative chondrodysplasia withautosomal recessive inheritance according to familial genealogy. ,2001

Poland Ã¢\x80\x94 Moebius syn drome is an overlapping disruption spectrum of inborn defects affecting theface and extremities. Five selected case records with this disease and thesequence of the Poland Ã¢\x80\x94 Moebius are presented.

688,"Mutations in the MECP2 gene (Methyl CpG binding protein) have recentlybeen reported causing Rett syndrome an X linked dominant neurodevel opmental disease. We investigated 302 sporadic cases of Rett syndromeby direct sequencing. 55 different mutations were found in 201 patients. We provide evidence for the existence of several hot spot regions and of adeletion prone region located at the 3ÃÂ« most region of the gene. Nine of 10recurrent mutations were located in either the methyl CpG binding domain(MBD) or in the transcriptional repression domain (TRD) and all missensemutations were located in one of these functionally important domains. With more than 60% there was a high frequency of truncating mutations(nonsense mutations along with frame shift mutations). We are comparingthe genotype to the phenotype of our collective. First results seem to showthat truncating mutations cause a more severe phenotype than the mis sense ones which on turn are more severe than deletion mutations. Com paring the mutation rate in the group of children until the age of 4 years there is a predominance of children without mutations (36 out of 101) ver sus children carrying a mutation (31 out of 201) (p < 0.01). These findingsmirror most probably the difficulties of an early correct diagnosis. Thedetection rate in our collective was 66 6%. However in classical cases thedetection rate is > 80%. Our findings show that the majority of German Rettpatients carry mutations in the MECP2 gene confirming the suggestedlocus homogeneity for the disease.

689,Presence of alfa/beta and gamma/delta T lymphocytes in demyelinatinglesions in multiple sclerosis (MS)suggests that they are responsible forlocal destruction of nervous tissue. This T cells may have autoimmunepotential and are thought to play important role in progression of MS. Lim ited junctional diversity of TCR gamma gene may indicate on in vivo clon al expansion of selected gamma/delta T lymhocytes which can be consid ered as antigen driven (auto)immune response. Our previous work showedrestricted TCR delta chain gene repertoire on the DNA and RNA level inperipheral blood of MS patients. The aim of this study was to analyze theTCR gamma chain gene rearrangement on the RNA level and to compareto that on the DNA. TCR gamma gene rearrangement has been analyzedin MS patients and healthy individuals using primers specific for V gamma1 4 subfamilies and J gamma 1/2 genes(DNA level)and specific for Vgamma 1 4 and C gamma genes (RNA level). In almost all MS patientsand healthy individuals poli or oligoclonal V1 V2 V3 and V4 J gammagene rearrangements have been observed. Comparison of TCR gammachain gene rearrangements on DNA and RNA level showed that themajority of TCR gamma rearrangements are not expressed. The V2 Cgamma gene rearrangement was predominantly observed in MS as well inhealthy individuals. The rearrangements of V1 V3 and V4 C gammahave been seen only in individual cases. Contrary to normal individuals inMS patients the TCR gamma rearrangements on the RNA level were most ly oligoclonal. It could be concluded tha oligoclonal pattern of TCR V2 Cgamma gene rearrangement at the RNA level along with increase of acti vated gamma/delta T cells i.e. expressing HLA DR and CD25 stronglyargue for significant role of gamma/delta lymphocytes in the pathogenesisof MS. ,2001
690,Chromosomal breakages are caused by inborn insufficiency of enzymaticsystems repairing mutations of chromosomal DNA. These diseases repre sent a serious precancerous state and in patients (and also in carriers) ofthese genetically determined diseases there is a greater incidence of onco logical cases. Following immunodeficiencies are associated with chromo somal instability Ataxia teleangiectatica Bloom syndrome xeroderma pig mentosum incontinentia pigmenti Nijmegen breakage syndrome Jadas sohn Ã¢\x80\x94 Lewandowski syndrome etc.. This group of pathological conditions could be already described as chromosomal breakage diseases. Theauthors are describing two cases where chromosomal instability wereaccompanied either by bizzare odontodysplasias and incontinentia pig menti or by severe oligodontia dyskeratosis congenita and ony chogryphoses. The acquired chromosomal abberations were caused in our patients probably by essential exposures to environmental influences. Themost important tasks in patients with chromosomal breakages are earlydiagnosis and special oncological preventive program. ,2001
691, regensburg.deCleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare autosomal dominant generalizedbone dysplasia characterized by high penetrance and variable expressivi ty. Mutations in the alpha 1 subunit of the core binding factor (CBFA1 now RUNX2) have been correlated with this disorder. Each of our CCD patientswas examined genetically and phenotypically in order to perform geno type phenotype correlations. We identified two heterozygous mutations intwo index cases R190Q and G146R with the latter shown to segregate ina family with variable expressivity. While the father showed all classicalsymptoms the son exhibited a less severe manifestation of the phenotypethat was exemplified by dental anomalies only. The R190Q mutation wasfound in a patient previously misdiagnosed based on clinical evidence ashaving Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome (RTS). However clinical reevaluationshowed a phenotypical variety of CCD. Zhou et al. ( Hum Mol Genet 8 2311 2316 1999) originally correlated the mutations R190Q and G146Xwith the classical phenotype due to haploinsufficiency. Both mutationsaffected the runt domain of the protein and both were shown to complete ly abolish DNA binding. Our cases show that due to the variable expres sivity of certain mutations of the CBFA1 gene CCD cannot be explainedby haploinsufficiency alone as exemplified by the T200A mutation reportedby Zhou et al. This mutation was correlated with variable expressivity butin contrast to our findings the manifestation of CCD was intensified inpassing from father to son. In our patient cohort the mutations R190Q andG146R were both correlated with non classical phenotypes and/or variableexpressivity. Therefore we agree with Zhou et al. that the clinical expres sivity of these mutations is altered due to hypomorphic effects or geneticmodifiers. ,2001
692," regensburg.deCleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare autosomal dominant generalizedbone dysplasia characterized by a widely variable expressivity. Anomaliesof the membranous and enchondral bone as well as dental characteristicshave been reported. Homozygous mice mutants show a complete lack ofbone development. Mutations in CBFA1 (now RUNX2) a master gene ofthe runt domain family were identified as the etiological factor of this dis order. While the dental system shows an almost constant affection in allCCD cases major skeletal symptoms like clavicular hypoplasia are notalways expressed. The reason for dental affection cannot be explained bymutations in the CBFA1 gene. Based on 15 CCD Patients treated in ourclinic and over 200 reviewed publications we describe our treatmentapproaches for various dentofacial symptoms. These include supernumer ary teeth persistence of deciduous teeth retained tooth germs leading toa reduced chewing ability cysts and the risk of pathological mandible frac ture. The craniofacial expressions are according to the patient s point ofview the main cause for the reduction in quality of life. By interdisciplinarytreatment involving an orthodontist dentist and maxillofacial surgeon awell functioning permanent dentition as well as an aesthetically satisfyingfacial appearance can be achieved. Due to the rareness of the disease general treatment guidelines are difficult to define. Most of the reports pub lished in the literature are single case reports not allowing statistically sig nificant conclusions. Therefore CCD patients should be advised as soonas possible by a qualified orthodontist to determine the optimal startingtime to achieve the best individual treatment. 198 Posters: Clinical Genetics and DysmorphologyP0511.

693,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized bycognitive and adaptive regression with autistic features loss of acquiredskills like speech and hand usage stereotypic hand movements epilepsy ataxia and deceleration of head growth that almost exclusively affectsfemales. Even before the causative gene for this syndrome was identified pedigree studies indicated that it was likely to be an X linked dominant disorder with presumed lethality in males. Nonetheless there were a fewdescriptions of males suspected of having Rett syndrome. These includesporadic cases meeting the clinical inclusion criteria sporadic males withKlinefelter syndrome (47 XXY) and males with severe neonatalencephalopathy in known Rett syndrome families. With the recent discov ery that the MECP2 gene on Xq28 is the gene responsible for most casesof Rett syndrome it is possible to molecularly assess cases suspected ofhaving male Rett syndrome by direct sequencing analysis. We describethe first 4 cases of molecularly confirmed cases of Rett syndrome in Israel. One of the families presented here consists of a female having classicalRett syndrome and a male sibling with severe neonatal encephalopathy. Molecular analysis revealed that both sister and brother have the sameMECP2 gene mutation however their mother does not suggestinggermline mosaicism. The case emphasizes the point that maternalgermline mosaicism may lead to affected female or male offspring whichshould be taken into consideration during genetic counseling regardingrecurrence risks and suggests that prenatal diagnosis may be warrantedin siblings of apparently sporadic cases of Rett syndrome. It also highlightsthe importance of molecular diagnosis in every case of idiopathic neonatalencephalopathy in males. ,2001
694,Otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 (OPD2) is an X linked dominant condi tion characterized by campomelia cleft palate craniofacial dysmorphismand variable combinations of solid organ malformations. Carrier femalescan have skeletal anomalies cleft palate and deafness. OPD2 is hypothe sised to be allelic to OPD1 based on clinical similarities and segregationpattern. The gene for OPD1 has been linked to a >10cM region withinXq28 but no linkage analysis of OPD2 has previously been reported. Wehave performed a linkage study on three generation Maori family segre gating OPD2 in an effort to localize a candidate interval for the responsiblegene. The distal Xq28 markers DXS1073 and DXS1108 showed perfectsegregation with the disease allele with two point lod scores of 2.41 and2.71 respectively and a multipoint lod score of 3.31. Studies of X inactiva tion in this family showed that the degree of skewing of the inactivation pat tern correlated with carriage of the disease allele and also the severity ofthe phenotype in carrier females (1 moderately skewed and 4 extremelyskewed patterns in carriers 2 random patterns in non carriers 4 uninfor mative results). An unaffected male was also shown to be recombinant atthe BGN locus narrowing the candidate interval to a 3.1 cM region withinXq28. This region contains in excess of 60 described genes. Identificationof the disease gene will allow direct examination of the hypothesis ofallelism not only with regard to OPD1 but also other phenotypically relat ed syndromes such as Melnick Needles syndrome and frontometaphysealdysplasia. ,2001

696,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) of von Recklinghausen is a common auto somal dominant disorder characterized by peripheral neurofibromas cafeau lait spots and Lish nodules of the iris. The high mutation rate at the NF1locus results in a wide range of molecular abnormalities. We have scaned7 different exons of the NF1 gene using DNA single strand conformationpolymorphism (DNA SSCP) and denaturing/temperature gradient gel elec trophoresis (DGGE/TGGE) methods (Gasparini P. et al. 1996) in series 60NF1 patients. Six different mutations have been detected (one in the exons6 12b 31 37 and two in the exon 29). To date majority of the reportedNF1 mutations are predicted to resulted in protein truncation but very fewstudies have correlated the causative NF1 mutation with the effect at themRNA level. We have applied a whole NF1 cDNA screening methodologyin our study and we have used a rapid and efficient strategy to screen theentire NF1 coding region by cDNA SSCP analysis followed by DNAsequencing. The identification of mutations in our NF1 patients using thecDNA SSCP method indicates that this approach is very powerful in thesearch for mutations in the NF1 gene and is extremly useful for the molec ular diagnosis of NF1 especially for sporadic cases as have been predict ed by Ars et al. 2000.

At the age of 8 month she developed an oli goepilepsy. Speech development was severely retarded. There was nomalformation of inner organs. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealeda terminal deletion of chromosome 8p 46 XX del(8)(p22) or a putativederivative translocation chromosome 46 XX der(8 ?)(p22 ?) respectively.24 colour multiplex FISH analysis demonstrated the loss of chromosome8p material without any hint of interchromosomal exchanges. FISH withsubtelomeric probes a microdissected subtelomere probe (generouslyprovided by Dr. J. Trent NIH) a subtelomeric PAC and cosmid probe revealed the loss of telomeric material for chromosome 8p and confirmeda terminal deletion in this child. The parents had normal karyotypes 46 XXand 46 XY. Thus in contrast to earlier reports this case does not give evi dence of genes in 8p23.1 responsible for heart defects. ,2001

We report on 5 families with a severe phenotype however 3 patients had a milder disease course with first symptoms around the firstbirthday. In 3 families linkage with 5q markers could be excluded noneshowed the typical deletion of the SMN1 gene. Diaphragmatic SMA Thisentity is usually characterized by initial respiratory insufficiency due todiaphragmatic palsy often followed by a distally pronounced weakness andwasting. We report 10 families without SMN1 deletion. One responsiblegene (SMARD) could recently be localized on chromosome 11. SMA andneurogenic arthogryposis This is a heterogeneous group including nonprogressive and non hereditary forms while in other patients congenitalcontractures are a consequence of anterior horn cell loss leading to pro gressive weakness. We report on at least 15 cases of different phenotypeswithout SMN1 deletion. With the exception of a severe X linked type thegenetic localization is still unknown. The definition of distinct clinical phe notypes is a prerequisite for the disclosure of the underlying geneticdefects. Knowledge of further genes causing neurogenic muscular atrophyis of great interest for elucidating the complex pathogenesis of anteriorhorn cell disease. Therefore we are interested in DNA studies of furtherfamilies with different SMA variants. ,2001

There was more alleles 677T among lower NTD than upper NTD (c2(1)=4.84 p=0.02) and controls (c2(1)=4.57 p=0.03). Combined heterozygosity 677CT/1298AC was not found as a risk factor in the present study. How ever combined homozygosity 677TT/1298CC was closely inexistent. These results suggest that the polimorphism 677TT in the MTHFR geneseems to be associated only with lower NTD. ",2001
700, bonn.deWe report on a 31 year old male patient with multiple anomalies and anincreased susceptibility to infections. Malformations include right upperlimb defect (peromelia) congenital heart defect (ventricular septal defect) imperforate anus short stature (1.55 m) strabismus divergens and hear ing impairment (neurosensory). Minor anomalies are hypospadia glandis cryptorchidism scoliosis and inguinal hernia. There was mild developmen tal delay and mild mental retardation. No similar anomalies were reportedin the patient s family except for one brother who had an atrial septaldefect that had been corrected in childhood. Cellular anomalies includefunctional impairment and deficiency of T helper cells low serum IgM leveland mild thrombocytopenia. Specific laboratory investigations showed noevidence of Fanconi anemia DiGeorge Syndrome Townes Brocks Syn drome and Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome. Some of the manifestations seen inour patient are part of the VACTERL association and the Oculo Oto Radi al (IVIC )Syndrome. However none of these syndromes can explain the spectrum of anomalies seen in our patient suggesting a new syndrome. ,2001
701,Nearly 30 years ago (1969) Opitz et al. reported on 2 sibs with a new pre viously apparently undescribed syndrome of multiple congenital anom alies. These sibs had a characteristic appearance with trigonocephaly flatnose strabismus epicanthal folds multiple bucco labial frenula shortstature postaxial hexadactyly joint contracture/dislocation/crepitation andloose skin. The syndrome was named the C syndrome. To date about 40published and about 30 unpublished cases are known to us for consulta tion. A gene causing C syndrome is not known. Defining syndromes on thebasis of propositi is fraught with many problems and frequently leads totruncation of the phenotype to its severest form. Moreover more than 70conditions are described with trigonocephaly of which the C syndrome isonly one phenotypes overlap widely. Thus we reviewed all of these cases of (presumed) C syndrome to reevaluate their nosological standing. Pay ing tribute to causes and symptoms we present a decision tree of how tomake the diagnosis which may help to distinguish between the C syn drome and other entities with trigonocephaly. In the remaining cases of theso called C phenotype (Reynolds 1989) further heterogeneity is sug gested on the basis of several sets of individuals sufficiently similar to eachother and sufficiently different from the C propositi. Thus for clinical andmethodological reasons it makes sense to create several C syndrome like groups to test the hypothesis of heterogeneity. The recently publishedsevere cases (Bohring et al. 1999) which may turn out now as a 3p sub telomeric duplication (McGaughran et al. 2000) are a striking but not theonly example. ,2001
702,The androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that binds ligands andregulates expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation and main tenance of the male phenotype. Different mutations in the AR gene areresponsible for a wide spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities in 46XY indi viduals resulting in a. clinical condition called androgen insensitivity syn drome (AIS). We studied the AR gene in two 46XY phenotypic females. One exhibited typical symptoms of complete form of AIS (CAIS) while thesymptoms in the second girl were milder. Direct sequencing of the amplifi cation products in first patient revealed C2718T transition in exon 6 creat ing a stop codon in position 786 in place of Arg codon. It has been previ ously established that this mutation results in complete loss of ligand bind ing ability and is responsible for clinical symptoms of CAIS. The examina tion of exon 6 in the second girl revealed G2754C transversion causingGln798Glu substitution and might trigger partial form of AIS (PAIS). It wasfound that mutation in the AR gene localised less than 40 nt downstreamfrom nt 2718 might affect ligand binding to a lesser extent and causechange in the patient s phenotype from CAIS to PAIS.

703,EDS IV or the vascular type of Ehlers Danlos syndrome is a connectivetissue disease predominated by vascular phenomena the most seriouscomplications being rupture of large arteries or bowels. Congenital anom alies are rare in EDS IV. Mutations in the COL3A gene resulting in anabnormal structure of collagen III are the cause of EDS IV. We describe a mother and son with EDS IV. The mother was born withhypoplasia of digiti II V with amniotic band like circular constrictions on theright hand a clubfoot on the right and macrocephaly according to the neu rologist as a result of normal pressure hydrocephaly. After the delivery ofher son she had severe spontaneous haemorhage from a ruptured leftsubclavial artery. She died two months later of massive dissection of thethoracic and abdominal aorta. Her son was born with a esophageal atre sia and macrocephaly due to communicating hydrocephaly. Protein analysis in fibroblast of the mother for collagen III abnormalitieswas normal. However DNA analysis of the COL3A gene revealed a pathogenic muta tion (388G T Gly130Arg) in the mother that was also found in the son. We will discuss the possible relationship between the congenital anomalies inour patients and EDS IV. Besides we want to stress that normal collagenIII protein analysis does not exclude EDS IV. ,2001
704,Netherton syndrome (NS MIM 256500) is a rare autosomal recessive dis order characterized by congenital ichthyosis a specific hair shaft defect(trichorrhexis invaginata) and atopic manifestations. Infants with this syn drome often fail to thrive. The clinical features may be variable and theychange gradually from birth on. As a results diagnosis of this disorder inPosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 201early childhood is difficult and the first tentative diagnosis may mistake it for other congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. We report on a 2 yearsold Taiwanese girl who was diagnosed with NS at age of 15 months. Shehad generalized erythroderma with desquamation and intermittent oozingsince birth and it changed to ichthyosis linearis circumflexa in late infancy. Atopic manifestations are present including eczema like rashes allergicconjunctivitis urticaria allergic rhinitis high serum Ig E (422 IU/mL) leveland hypereosinophilia (1080/cmm). Skin biopsy showed parakeratosis ofthe epidermis and a dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis. Her scalp hair is sparse and brittle and showed characteristic bamboohair picture by microscopy. Her body weight gain is poor (< 3 rd %ile).Medical treatment only alleviates her clinical symptoms slightly. Since NSgene was mapped to 5q32 by Chavanas et al. recently linkage analysis isperformed on the family. We will show our preliminary data at the confer ence. ,2001

706, heidelberg.deOtocephaly ( agnathia ) is a rare developmental field complex with struc tural defects limited to the craniofacial region. It can occur alone or inassociation with a variety of malformations most frequently holoprosen cephaly and situs inversus. We report of a fetus with otocephaly and a pre viously undescribed malformation pattern lacking both holoprosencephalyand situs inversus. The parents were non consanguineous and there wereno evidence of infection or exposure to teratogenic factors during preg nancy. Ultrasound examination at 30 weeks gestation revealed polyhy dramnion and fetal malformations. Amniocentesis was performed sponta neous fetal death occurred five days later. Subsequent examination (length34 cm 3rd centile weight 810 g 3 10th centile) showed otocephaly withvery deep set dysmorphic ears nearly complete absence of the mandible microstomia hypoplasia of the tongue and blind ends of nasal and oralcavities. There was no holoprosencephaly or situs inversus. Both kidneysand ureters were absent and there was anal atresia. Skeletal malforma tions included bilateral club feet multiple rib fusions with dysgenesis of thethoracic spine and os sacrum. The umbilical cord contained one artery andone vein. Laboratory investigations showed normal chromosomes andexcluded microdeletion 22q11.2. The pathogenesis of otocephaly and theassociated malformation pattern is as yet unknown but is thought to repre sent a developmental field defect involving the first branchial arch. Evi dence indicates that it may be due to a range of chromosomal monogenicand teratogenic factors. ,2001
707,Since Allanson et al. (1) described four individuals with the co occurrenceof the Noonan syndrome and manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1(NF1) more than 30 patients are reported in the literature. As discussedfrom Carey (2) it is still debated if the Neurofibromatosis Noonan syndrom(NFNS) represents a true syndrome or simply a variable manifestation ofNF1. We want to present two patients with the Neurofibromatosis Noonanphenotype. The first patient is a 22 year old woman with fully expressedNF1 and with the additional features pulmonary stenosis ptosis of theeyelids short stature and mental retardation. The underlying mutation inthe NF1 gene is identified a stop mutation in exon 13 C2041T. The sec ond patient is a 18 year old woman. She has multiple caf au lait spots202 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyand a pulmonary stenosis a short stature and facial features typical of Noonan syndrome. She has neither Lisch nodules nor neurofibroma. How ever in the MRI there was a lesion indicative of a glioma of the medullaoblongata. Her mental development is normal. A mutation in the NF1 geneis not yet identified but the analyses are still in progress. A FISH analysiscould exclude a large deletion of the NF1 gene. In both cases there is nofamily history of NF1 or Noonan syndrome. We want to discuss the clinicaland molecular findings in these patients.

708,Cytogenetic studies on idiopathic infertile men have shown structuraldefects on Y chromosome. These findings suggest that Y chromosomecontains the genes regulating spermatogenesis. Recently the genesresponsible for spermatogenesis which are located at intervals V and VI ofYq.11.23 regions have been cloned and named as Azoospermia FactorLokus (AZF) by the use of molecular techniques. In this study we studied38 infertile men. The infertility etiology of twenty three of these patients hadbeen defined as idiopathic while varicocele infection obstruction andtoxic agent exposure was given as the reason for infertility in seven three four and one patients respectively. Twenty six patients had azoospermiaand twelve had oligospermia. SY84 and SY86 primers of AZFa zone SY127 and SY134 primers of AZFb zone SY255 and SY254 primers ofAZFc zone and SY14 primers of SRY gene were used as internal controlsand target DNA samples were amplified by multiplex PCR method to deter mine the presence of microdeletions in q11.23 region of Y chromosome of38 infertile men whose karyotypes were cytogenetically normal (46 XY).Amplification by SY254 and SY127 has not revealed any visible bands inone of the cases (2.6%) indicating deletions in AZFb and AZFc (DAZgene) regions. ,2001
709,Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism is a heterogeneousgroup of very rare skeletal dysplasias determining severe growth retarda tion of prenatal onset. It may be associated with brain dysgenesis such asneuronal heterotopias. Perisylvian dysgenesis is a rare cortical dysplasiawith variable neurological dysfunction. We describe a 3 yr old female childborn to unrelated Caucasian parents. Severe intrauterine growth retarda tion was detected by ultrasound during the pregnancy. Birthweight was1 645 g ( 4 SD) with a length of 41 cm ( 4 SD) and head circumferenceof 28 cm ( 8 SD). Placental infarcts and fibrosis were observed. Propor tionate severe global short stature microcephaly and mild dysmorphicsigns were noted. There was left arm hemiparesis. Karyotype was 46 XX. Clinical course was relatively mild with respect to severe ( 8 SD) micro cephaly but there was major failure to thrive and delayed milestones (satat 12 months walked at 24 months said a few words at 20 months).Growth parameters are still at 6 SD for weight and length. A skeletal sur vey indicated several of the signs described by Majewski in the so calledprimordial osteodyplastic dwarfism type II such as plastyspondyly and mildvertebral clefting narrow pelvis with dysplastic iliac wings short humeriand femora with metaphyseal flairing. MRI showed asymetric perisylvianpolymicrogyria involving most of the right hemisphere which was mostsevere in the right perisylvian region and sparing the right mesial occipitallobe. We suggest the patient has a hitherto undescribed association ofosteodysplastic primordial dwarfism and perisylvian polymicrogyria. ,2001
710,Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of hereditary dermatoses in which mildmechanical trauma or other causes lead to blistering of the skin. FirstCockayne (1938) described the type with bullose eruption of the feet andReadett (1961) reported a family in which 14 members in 5 generationswere known to have localized epidermolysis bullosa similar to thoseobserved by Cockayne. Cartledge and Myers (1943) reported an affectedfamily from West Virginia where blistering occured only on the hands andfeet and mainly in warm weather after continuous walking or labor withhand tools. The clinical findings varied widely in severity from severe gen eralized blistering from birth to temporary blistering of feet in summer. Bouwes Bavinck et al. (1987) reviewed the clinical features of the Cock ayne Touraine form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The clinical fea tures showed considerable interfamilial variation. They described an exten sively affected family with autosomal dominant dystrophic EB at least 4members of the family also had congenital localized absence of skin asseen in Bart syndrome. The autors describe an affected family with dys trophic epidermolysis bullosa on the hands and feet in 4 generations. Twomembers of the family father and son have been investigated personally. The blistering started immediately after birth and progressed slowly to aphase of dystrophic scars and areas of atrophy. The bullae were localizedon hands and feet showing worsening in summer. In addition to the skinlesions the nails were dystrophic too. Cytogenetic analysis showedtranslocation (5 13) (q13 q3.34) in affected persons. Clinical and geneticheterogeneity of the disease will be discussed. ,2001
711,Recent studies have shown that the risk of many solid tumors is decreasedamong people with Down syndrome. We used Multiple Cause MortalityFiles compiled from U. S. death certificates for 1983 to 1997 to examine theoccurrence of major categories of malignant neoplasms among more than17 800 Down syndrome associated deaths. Proportionate mortality ratios which measure whether a specific medical condition is more or less likelyto be listed on death certificates on which Down syndrome is also listedthan in all deaths was used to test for associations. We found that personswith Down syndrome were 1.5 times (95% CI 1.4 1.7) more likely to haveleukemia listed on their death certificates than persons without Down syn drome confirming this well recognized association. However death certifi cates from persons with Down syndrome were much less likely to listmalignant neoplasms other than leukemia (PMR = 0.09 95% CI 0.08 0.10). PMRs for almost all major classes of malignant neoplasms were sig nificantly lower than expected. For example the PMRs for prostate cancer ovarian cancer breast cancer in females cancers of the lung and airways and cervical cancer were all less than 0.1. Strikingly low PMRs for malig nancy were associated with Down syndrome at all ages and in both gen ders. Possible explanations for the paucity of cancers among Down syn drome associated deaths include decreased susceptibility of cells frompeople with Down syndrome to tumorigenesis and/or reduced exposure toenvironmental risk factors such as tobacco and certain occupational expo sures. ,2001
712,Stickler syndrome (MIM108300) is a autosomal dominant disorder withcharacteristic ophthalmological and orofacial features deafness and arthri tis. Very similar features are also found in Marshall syndrome (MIM154780) but these patients more often have short stature and abnormali ties in cranial ossification and retinal detachment occurs less frequently. High myopia retinal detachment and abnormalities of vitreous gel archi tecture are a pathgnomonic feature of the Stickler syndrome. The majorityof families with This syndrome have mutations in the COL2A1 gene. Onemutation causing Stickler syndrome and one causing Marshall syndromePosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 203have been detected in the COL11A1. A null allele mutation in the COL2A1 gene led to a typical phenotype of Stickler syndrome. Clinical details of ourpatients (11) and families are discussed with emphasis on differential diag nosis. ,2001

714,Mitochondrial diabetes encompasses the previously described spectrum of3243 and 1555 mutations of the Mt tRNA genes. Recently a Japanesestudy identified an additional tRNALeu mutation at position 3298 in a sub set of diabetic patients. We describe a patient with a combination of insulindependent diabetes mellitus late onset deafness epilepsy a poren cephalic cyst and mental retardation. He also exhibited some widespread bluish skin lesions. A history of neonatal asphyxia was recorded. Sincethere was an association of diabetes and deafness a search for tRNAmutations was performed. A heteroplasmic 3298 A > G transition wasidentified in more than 80 % of DNA extracted from peripheral lympho cytes. This result confirms that mutation 3298 determines mitochondrialdiabetes. However if we assume that mental retardation and porencephal ic cyst are not only due to perinatal brain insult this report may alsoexpand the spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms associated with thismutation. This would be similar to the 3243 mutation which can determinemitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke likeepisodes in some cases deafness only or deafness and diabetes in oth ers. This finding indicates that the 3298 mutation may represent anotherexample of mitochondrial unpredictable clinical expression. ,2001
715,Here we report on a 6 month old male patient with a rare variant of Prad er Willi Syndrome (PWS). Birth weight 3 2 kg length 50 cm were within thenormal range but due to his head circumference (OFC) of 37 cm a cae sarian section was performed. In most cases PWS is caused by an inter stitial deletion of the proximal segment of chromosome 15q a maternaldisomy 15q11 13 or more rarely due to an imprinting centre mutation. Inaddition structural chromosome aberrations like translocations inver sions isochromosomes or rarely ring chromosomes that lead to a deletionor a duplication of the PWS critical region were described in PWS patients. An unbalanced translocation 3 15 was found by high resolution bandingand FISH analysis leading to the following karyotype 45 XY 15 der(3)t(3 15)(q28 q12) de novo. Since this findings suggested the pres ence of PWS in the patient molecular analysis was performed. Diagnosiswas confirmed by methylation specific PCR Southern Blot and FISHanalysis using the D15S10 probe. The patient thus represents a rare caseof PWS combined with an additional deletion of the terminal segment ofchromosome 3. This certainly is an unique observation but is of generalinterest to study combinatorial effects of PWS with autosomal deletionsothers than of chromosome 15. The most striking phenotypic findings ofthe patient at an age of 6 month were hypotonia macrocephaly (>90 cen tile) with frontal bossing retrognatia preauricular tags strabismus diver gens flexions anomalies of the upper limbs and bilateral club feet how ever a more detailed description will be presented. ,2001
716, link.comCongenital duodenal membrane (CDM) has been classified as a type ofduodenal atresia. It occurred mainly sporadically and several cases in fam ily have been observed. Here we describe a membranous type of duode nal atresia in two sibs a sister and a brother following third and fourthpregnancy of consanguineous parents. The first pregnancy in the familyended with a spontaneous abortion in a first trimester and the secondresulted in a healthy girl. Both affected children showed isolated duodenalatresia having normal karyotype. They were successfully operated usingduodenojejunostomy. An autosomal recessive type of inheritance was sug gested. ,2001

Although SHFM implies the existence of a cleft in an affectedlimb numerous other abnormalities are considered under this term. Ourobjective was to describe the phenotypic spectrum of SHFM for a moreaccurate delineation of this condition. Subjects Methods We reviewed 31limb radiographs of 17 individuals with non syndromic SHFM. Totally 12/17individuals had some sort of kinship and 6 of them were members of theWadoma tribe in which high frequency of SHFM has been reported. Results Eleven individuals displayed SHFM anomalies in 20 affectedhands with bilateral involvement in 9 cases. Hand abnormalities included hypoplastic dysplastic absent phalanges (#11) or metacarpals (#10) triphalangeal thumb (#5) articulation between metacarpal heads (#4) abnormal growth plates (#4) bone or soft tissue syndactyly (#3) clin odactyly (#2) transversely grown bones (#2). Twelve individuals hadSHFM in 22 affected feet with bilateral involvement in 10 cases.

718,Microdeletion of chromosome 22q11.2 has a wide phenotypic spectrumwith variable associated anomalies. Familial transmission of this deletionin two generations has been reported previously. To our knowledge wereport the first three generation transmission of del(22q11.2) in one familywho had unique findings of congenital laryngotracheal webs (CLW) andearly onset colorectal carcinoma. The proband a 53 year old white female presented with psychiatric illness and mild mental retardation. As a new born she was diagnosed with a ventriculoseptal defect and severe respi ratory problems secondary to a CLW. She was diagnosed with adenocar cinoma of the sigmoid colon at 41 years. Her daughter presented withapparent hypertelorism while her grandson had a CLW hoarse voice hypertelorism ventriculoseptal defect and anal stenosis. All three individ uals had del(22q11.2). CLW are rare defects that may occur alone or inassociation with other anomalies. Two families with CLW congenital heart disease and short stature have been reported. However analysis fordel(22q11.2) was not performed. These findings suggest that CLW may becaused by the deletion. The early onset of colorectal malignancy in ourcase is of interest. Recently an unidentified putative tumor suppressorgene involved in colorectal carcinoma has been localized to 22q. The lossof heterozygosity for alleles on certain chromosomes including 22q hasbeen identified in nealy 50% of colorectal tumors. Further studies areneeded to assess whether individuals with del(22q11.2) are at increasedrisk for developing this malignancy. ,2001
719,Background Trisomy 13 is in 90% a lethal condition in the first year of life. The clinical outcome associated with mosaic trisomy 13 is less clear andcan range from severe mental retardation and birth defects to normalinteligence. Chromosomal mosaicisms with two autosomal trisomies areexceedingly rare. Double non disjunction or anaphase lag or non disjunc tion and anaphase lag during early embryonic mitotic division could be thecause. Case report We present a 3 year old girl the second child of healthy non consanguinal parents. At birth physical examination showeddysmorphic features low set dysplastic ears microphthalmia slightlyupsalnted palpebral fissures bulbous nose small mouth and microg nathia. Cardiac ultrasound scan showed atrial septal defect ventricularseptal defect and open ductus Botally. Motor development was slightlyretarded. At the age of 3 years her Denver developmental screening testresult approached the developmental level deemed appropriate for herchronological age. GTG banded preparations of the patient obtained fromcultures of peripheral blood samples showed 47 chromosomes in all thespreads. The patient s karyotype was 47 XX +13/47 XX +21. A total of 75metaphase spreads was analysed out of which 65 cells were 47 XX +21and 10 were 47 XX +13. Conclusions A girl child with facial dysmorphism congenital heart disease and mosaicism of two trisomic cell lines trisomy13(13%) and trisomy 21(87%) is reported. To our knowledge trisomy13/trisomy 21 mosaicism has not been previously reported. ,2001
720,BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common recessive disor der caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conduc tance Regulator Gene (CFTR). The distribution of over 800 different CFTRmutations depends on the ethnic and geographic origin. OBJECTIVE Todetermine genotype phenotype correlation in Croatian CF patients in orderto establish weather patients with different genotypes showed differencesof phenotypic expression in pancreatic and pulmonary disease. METH ODS The clinical diagnosis od CF was made according to the high sweatchloride values chronic pulmonary disease pancreatic insufficiency andPseudomoans colonisation. The molecular analysis of the 16 most com mon CFTR mutations (according to the data from Cystic Fibrosis GeneticAnalysis Consortium) was performed. RESULTS The analysis of 98 chro mosomes revealed the frequency of deltaF508 in 59% of Croatian patients. R117H was present in 4% G542X in 3% 1717 1G A (3%) N1303K (2%) G85E (1%) and R1162X (1%). Further analysis of remaining CF alleles isplanned. All deltaF508 homozygous patients had a severe phenotype anearly age at diagnosis high sweat chloride values pancreatic insufficien cy similar severity of lung disease. Severity of the clinical course indeltaF508 heterozygous patients depended on another mutation present inCFTR gene heterozygotes with N1303K G542X 17171G A R1162X andG85E had severe CF phenotype with pancreas insufficiency but variablepulmonary disease. The heterozygous patients with R117H mutationrevealed mild or severe clinical course with variable pancreatic phenotypebut consistent mild pulmonary disease. ,2001
721,"Sumary A study of 2620 pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortionrevealed a CNS defect in 3.6% of embryos an fetuses and 3% of all com plete conceptuses. The type of malformation observed varied with the ges tational age at expulsion encephaloceles being predominant in earlierspecimens while more typical anencephalus and spina bifida were morecommon among later abortions. Chromosome abnormalities were found in40% of abortuses with CNS defects but were almost entirely confined tothose which were still at the embryonic stage of development. 53 % of thelater were chromosomally abnormal which is the same as the proportionfound among embryos without a CNC malformation. Using published life tables of recognised pregnancies it was estimated that the prevalence ofanencephalus spina bifida or related malformation (other than hydro cephalus) without a chromosome anomaly is 5.3 per thousand concep tuses at the begining of the eight week of gestation. By comparing this withthe prevalence in total births it was further estimated that only 24% ofthese are born alive with 54% aborting spontaneously and 22% being still born.

722,Background Woodhouse Sakati syndrome is an autosomal recessive dis order characterized by hypogonadism alopecia diabetes mellitus mentalretardation and electrocardiographic abnormalities. The combination ofendocrine and neuroectodermal abnormalities has been reported as dis tinctive familial syndromes. The number of variants of the alopecia mentalretardation hypogonadism syndromes represent a clinical problem in dif ferential diagnosis. Case report In a 52 year old woman from a consan guine pedigree we observed mental retardation short stature alopeciawith absence of eyebrows hypogonadism primary amenorrhea and dia betes mellitus. Other manifestations include problems of limited mobility ofupper extremities. A deceased cousin also had a similar phenotype. Thediagnosis of Turner syndrome and congenital myotonic dystrophy weresuggested by referring physicians however clinical neurophysiological cytogenetic analysis and molecular genetic testing for myotonic dystrophyexcluded the two syndromes. Conclusion Comparing the phenotype of ourpatient to similar cases in the literature the features suggest that she hasWoodhouse Sakati syndrome. Other manifestations such as problems oflimited mobility of upper extremities are previously undescribed as symp tomatic of the syndrome. The report of this patient with Woodhouse Sakatisyndrome a rare but distinctive disorder is to our knowledge the thirddescribed in the literature. ,2001
723,Since 1993 the Malignant Hyperthermia Center of the Department of Phar macology has received 121 patients to perform the caffeine/halothane testaccording to the American Protocol (Larach 1994). 11 patients were sentto evaluation for having clinical/genetic conditions associated to a greaterrisk for developing malignant hyperthermia (MH). Among the other 110patients 32 had presented a suspected MH crisis themselves and 78 hada positive familial history. The familial cases were arranged in 25 families. Among the 66 positive patients there were 2 with Noonan phenotype 9with palpebral ptosis 1 central core disease 1 enchondromatosis 2 with high CPK and 1 had Kabuki Make up Syndrome a previously undescribedassociation. Upon a thorough clinical review by a clinical geneticist includ ing complete pedigrees from all families we found among the non syn dromic patients on admission the Kabuki patient a Noonan family and aprobable myotonic dystrophy patient mother of two affected siblings. Westate that clinical geneticists working together with pharmacologists can beof great help to diagnose previously unnoticed genetic conditions in fami lies with known pharmacogenetic diseases like MH and also to select with in those families the best subjects for further mutation studies on the RYR1gene and others involved on the malignant hyperthermia phenotype. ,2001
724,Hypomelanosis of Ito (HI) is a pigmentary dysplasia characterized by lin ear streaks and swirls of depigmented skin. In many cases of HI skindepigmentation is the only abnormality but in 70% of reported HI casesthere are other associated anomalies. These include mental retardation neural skeletal and ocular anomalies. The status of orodental abnormali ties in the syndromic cases of HI has not been adequately described. A29 year old male followed since he was 10 years of age is presented. Heshows a constellation of abnormalities some of them have not been pre viously reported. The clinical findings include short stature asymmetricface and body right microcornea bilateral juvenile cataracts hearing loss localized alopecia hypodontia hypoplastic teeth retention of primaryteeth migratory glossitis mal occlusion prognathism prominent chin andlinear streaks and swirls of depigmented skin involving the arms trunk andface. Recently he developed glaucoma of the left eye and his vision hasdeteriorated rapidly. At 27 years of age he has developed seizures and theMRI shows structural brain anomalies. He is of normal intelligence. Inde pendent chromosome studies of 20 and 100 cells from peripheral bloodand of 30 and 100 cells from biopsies of hypomelanotic and normal skinshowed a normal 46 XY male karyotype. Cytogentic analysis of culturedcorneal cells showed significant karyotypic mosaicism 45 X[7/30]/46 X Y +mar[3/30]/47 XY +20[4/30]/47 XY +5[2/30]/46 XY[14/30]. It is no clear if this corneal mosaicism is associated with the observed clin ical findings or if it is a coincidental finding as it has been reported by Pet tenati MJ et al. 1996. It should be noted that the lack of mosaicism in theskin biopsy has been reported in about 25% of HI cases. The presence ofdepigmentation of the skin and the lack of hair follicles in the depigmentedskin of the chin sugguests that this is due to genetic alterations expressedin the dermal cells. To our knowledge this is a new finding that supportsthe hypothesis of dermal changes for HI. Although a specific syndrome hasnot yet been recognized for MCA associated with HI the severity and wide spectrum of the findings in our case suggest the existence of such a syn drome. The natural history of this case demonstrates the late onset of sev eral clinical manifestations such as seizures glaucoma loss of vision brain anomalies and the progressive nature of the disorder. ,2001
725,Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterizedby development of hamartomata in a variety of tissues and organs. Intel lectual handicap epilepsy and abnormal behavioral phenotypes derivefrom hamartomatous brain involvement. Other involved organs are skin kidneys and heart. The disease is caused by a mutation in either TSC1(9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3). The two gene products probably interact astumor suppressors. One third of TS cases are familial equally representedbetween TSC1 and nan,2001
726,Schinzel Giedion Syndrome (SGS) is a rare presumed autosomal reces sive condition characterized by midface hypoplasia coarse features aswell as multiple skeletal cardiac and genitourinary abnormalities. Thosesurviving beyond the newborn period develop seizures spasticity and areseverely developmentally delayed. An underlying metabolic condition hasbeen hypothesized given the clinical features in combination with thedemonstration by serial magnetic resonance brain imaging of a progres sive neurodegenerative process in one patient. Investigations to date havenot detected an inborn error of metabolism. We report a male patient witha pattern of malformations consistent with SGS. Features included micro cephaly large anterior fontanelle splayed sutures midface hypoplasia depressed nasal bridge prominent ear lobules short neck with redundant nuchal fold deep set hyperconvex nails rocker bottom feet small penisand generalized hirsutism. Pelvicaliectasis was present with vesico ureter al reflux. Skeletal radiographs showed broad ribs and scoliosis. CranialMRI demonstrated agenesis of the corpus callosum enlarged ventriclesand loss of convolutions. Along with coarsening features he developedspasticity progressive contractures and global delay. Seizures developedat 6 weeks with a markedly abnormal EEG. A metabolic work up was per formed including skin bone marrow and liver biopsies. The latter demon strated a dilatation of the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum withno evidence of storage material. Isoelectric focusing of transferrins wassuggestive of an abnormal glycosylation pattern however the proportionswere not typical of that seen in Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation(CDG). Further investigations are underway to elucidate the significance ofthese results. ,2001
727,The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac disorder characterized by aprolonged QT interval and life threatening tachyarrhythmias which maygive rise to recurrent syncope or sudden cardiac death. The long QT syn drome is a heterogenic clinical and genetic entity. Five genes have beenidentified for cardiac potassium (KCNQ1 LQT1 HERG LQT2 KCNE1 LQT5 KCNE2 LQT6) and sodium (SCN5A LQT3). Sixty unrelated Russ ian families (122 patients with Romano Ward syndrome and 3 patientswith Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome) were clinically evaluated usingmedical histories ECGs Holter recordings with the heart rate variability(HRV). An exercise test (treadmill) was performed in 52 long QT syndromepatients. We have tested all the patients for mutation in 4 genes KCNQ1(exons 2 6 7) HERG (exons 6 7) KCNE1 and KCNE2 using PCR SSCPanalysis. A single mutation was found in KCNQ1 in 6 families (R174H inone family 2 patients G314S in two families 7 patients and A341V in threefamilies 7 patients). Clinical and ECG Characteristic in 6 families with LQTS LCTS = left cervico thoracic sympathectomy propr. propranolol n QTc = QTc <440 ms The phenotype was less severe in G314S mutation thanA341V. The phenotype probably varies by specific mutation. Phenotypicheterogeneity is also caused by variable penetrance and expressivity. ,2001
728,An increasing number of malformation syndromes makes it difficult for theclinician to reach a diagnosis. OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance inMan) was tested as a decision support system for the diagnostic processof patients with malformations. We used the data of 99 patients with differ ent clinically confirmed syndromes and searched in OMIM for differentialdiagnoses by using the signs of the respective patient in all possible com binations in the search string. Two different search strategies were tested (1) utilisation of all signs of the patient (2) usage of those signs that a clin ical expert considered to be important for diagnosis. All 99 syndromes weredescribed in and presented by OMIM. With one sign used for a search thenumber of differential diagnoses varied from no diagnosis at all to 1512.With strategy (1) 29% of all signs were not used for the description of therespective syndrome in OMIM while this was 7% with strategy (2). Thenumber of differential diagnosis decreased with the number of signs usedin combinations using the AND junction. By utilising combinations of twoPosters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 207 R174H 2 ptsG314S 3 ptsG314S 4 ptsA341V 1ptA341V 2 ptsA341V 4 pts Age yrs 25ÃÂ±21 24ÃÂ±13 24ÃÂ±14 16 24ÃÂ±13 17ÃÂ±16 Sex (M/F) n 0/2 2/1 2/2 0/1 0/2 3/1 Pts withsyncope2 (100%) 2 (67%) 3 (75%) 0 2 (100%) 3 (75%) sudden death pts0 0 0 0 0 1 (25%) Pts with LCTS 0 0 0 0 1 (50%) 1 (25%) QTc ms(lead II)555ÃÂ±18 4 482ÃÂ±40 0 448ÃÂ±38 2 547 540ÃÂ±11 3 497ÃÂ±23 9 Pts with n QTc 0 1 (33%) 2 (50%) 0 0 0 Pts with syncopeon propr.0 0 0 0 2(100%) 2 (50%)signs the list of differential diagnoses was reduced to an average of 10 for the 1st strategy.

OMIM was an acceptable tool in both strategies althoughit has not been developed as a decision support system in the realm ofmalformation syndromes. Our results show that the application of OMIM issometimes tedious a consultation of OMIM seems to be useful in the diag nostic process of malformation syndromes however. ,2001
729,A study was conducted to gather information about the physical mentaland social health of patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) and about theirinfluence on the family life focussing on social aspects. Personal or tele phone interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. 203parents of 127 children (60 girls 67 boys) with AS were contacted with thehelp of the Angelman e. V and participated in the study. Average age of thepatients was 9 years (range 3 to 25). The parents of 93 patients reporteda variation of the reaction to pain in their children for 96 children espe cially the older ones a good local orientation was described which proofedto be much better than had been anticipated due to the mental retardationof the children. More than 90% of the families disclosed a high impact ofthe AS children on the family life. In about 70% of all cases at least one ofthe parents had to stop working or could not work as much as they hadliked to do because of the caring for the diseased child. In about half of allcases friendships were lost. 25% of the families were not satisfied with thefinancial situation nearly 40% reported problems with the health insur ance about half of all interviewees informed about problems with theadministration. All had to change furnishing of their homes to build up asafe environment for their AS child. The care for a chronically ill childdeserves high efforts on part of the parents therefore an urgent demandexists for a better social support of the families caring for an AS child. ,2001
730, link.comThree unrelated cases with 5 alpha reductase deficiency a very rare formof male pseudohermaphroditism are reported. By the time of their pubertythey appeared girls although their genitalia showed clitoromegaly and theirbehaviour were estimated as masculine by their parents. All three wereidentified during puberty when their sexual development evolved in a maledirection. Male body structure and skin hair pattern as well as voicechanges and male like genitalia were formed. Hormonal tests revealed avery low level of dihydrotestosterone with abnormaly high level of follicle stimulating hormone whereas serum testosterone and luteinizing hormonelevels were in a normal male range. Both of the patients have chosen tochange their formal gender whereas the third decided not to. ,2001
731,Two individuals with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) due to deletion of15q11 q13 died after a short period of minor symptoms of gastroenteritis. The first case is a 26 year old female who experienced loss of appetite andfeelings of discomfort prior to an episode of unexpected vomiting and sub sequent collapse. Laparatomy revealed gastric necrosis and rupture. Thesecond case is a 32 year old male who complained of feeling unwell withloss of appetite for a period of 48 hours. He suffered diarrhoea and vomit ing and subsequently collapsed. A dilated stomach with necrotic patcheswere noted at post mortem. Four other cases of PWS (all female) havebeen reported with symptoms of gastroenteritis associated with gastricrupture and/or gastric necrosis. A diagnosis of PWS was made at themolecular level in each case (Wharton RH et al. Am J Med Genet (1997)73 437 41). Two of these individuals survived after a subtotal gastrectomy the other two died. These findings illustrate that minor abdominal symp toms and/or slightly altered behaviour may be indicative of a life threaten ing disease in PWS individuals. On this basis we suggest that parents andhealth professionals inform the Hospital staff nearby about the features ofreduced pain perception and of lack of vomiting in PWS. Post morteminvestigation and molecular confirmation of diagnosis should be provided. Future work to investigate the physiology of pain perception and gastricfunction in PWS is recommended. ,2001
732,Cri du chat (CDC) is a genetic disorder caused by the lost of genetic mate rial of chromosome s 5 short arm (5p ). The syndrome affects 1 50.000children born and takes place at the moment of conception. The objectiveof this work is to relate the experience of a group of parents and profes sionals who joined themselves to create a national association whose goalis to find as much CDC patients as possible. In three months since thefoundation we have promising results. We have already a home page(www.criduchat.com.br) that has been working as a reference to familiesand professionals interested in CDC. We have localized 30 patients withinBrazil with different ages. All these people are registered and their charac teristics filed. Empirically we can already ascertain that there are too manydifferences between those older and the younger due to the investmentmade in early stimulation. Indeed among the younger the informationplays a special role in the search of the best therapy. We also couldobserve that the association with its role of centralizing and propagatinginformation has been contributing to the recovery in the treatment of theolder. As a conclusion we can say that the formation of such associationis crucial to aid the parents to increase CDC people s quality of life andrepresents a concrete option to change the history of CDC patients inBrazil. ,2001
733,About 15% of children with mental retardation (MR) have pathologicalchanges in chromosomes associated with expressive dysmorphic signs intheir phenotype. The aim of study was to assess the frequency of chromo some abnormalities in children with MR and expressive dysmorphic sings. The cytogenetic analyses were done for children with MR and high dys morphic score (equal or > 7). The Waldrop protocol for the assessment ofdysmorphology was used. A sample of 217 children with MR was exam ined. Chromosome abnormalities were found in 59 5% of children withexpressive dysmorphic signs and MR predominantly in those from thegroup with severe and deep MR. Only 4 3% of the group with easier formsof MR had chromosome abnormalities (autosome and gonosome abnos rmalities were found in equal number). In the group with severe and deepMR all pathological changes were found on autosomal chromosomes(16 5% children from this group). Leading chromosome abnormality wastrisomy of 21 chromosome present in 6 9% children with MR with refer ence to 15 2% of children with severe and deep MR. Ethiologic basis ofMR in children with expressive dysmorphic signs are mostly chromosomalabnormalities specialy in the group with severe and deep MR. Assess ment of dysmorphic score by Waldrop protocol is simple quick and aplica tive method useful as a criteria for cytogenetic analyses and revealing ofMR ethiology. ,2001
734,The diagnosis in dysmorphology is to a large extent not in the realm ofmolecular genetics or cytogenetics. The clinical practice requires experi ence and observation competence by the practitioners. They are confront ed with quantitative morphological variation and clinical signs whichtogether result in a complex phenotype. There are no simple (mechanical)relations between signs and diagnosis. We examined the components ofthe visual diagnostic act choosing hypertelorism as an example. The eyedistances in the portraits of 20 adults were manipulated with the help of208 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologycomputer programs. For each face we produced a series of 20 pictures with a systematically increasing eye distance. The variant pictures of allfaces were arranged in a randomised order into 4 catalogues. 70 students 10 advanced students in paediatrics and 12 clinical geneticists had todecide for seven traits whether these seemed to be normal or not. Thejudgements on traits which were not modified vary for each face unspeci ficly and to a small degree. Those on the eye distance show an overallcharacteristic relation to the degree of the modification of the individualface whereas the judgements on the identical eye distance in differentfaces are diverse. Additionally we found only a small concurrence betweenthe judgements of the probands and the objective measurements of theeye distance which are used in anthropometrics. By multivariate analysiswe showed that different parts of the individual faces influence the judge ments to different degrees. In particular the form of the midface is strong ly related to the process of making up someones mind about the eye dis tance. Finally there are no striking differences between the judgements ofthe different groups of probands. Diagnosis of hypertelorism is a processof pattern recognition. Nevertheless (or just therefore) the clinical judge ment of the practitioner works well. All attempts to make diagnosis moreintersubjective will have to take these results into account. ,2001
735,In present time neurology recognized more than 300 neuromuscular disor ders. Their fenotypical manifestation is extremly variable and clinical fea tures may overlap among them. So there are a strong interest for devel opping molecular methods which facilitate unequivocal differentional diag nostics. Recently we have focused on myotonic dystrophy (MD) one of themost frequent neuromuscular disease of adult age. The molecular base ofMD is the expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeat in dystrophia myotonicaprotein kinase gene (DMPK) which is located on the 19q13.3. Clinical pic ture of MD is very variable including all the spectra of forms from the verymild old age form to the very serious and often fatal congenital one. Toimprove the diagnostics we have introduced and modified PCR methodsfor precise measurement of fyziological and premutation range allels andfor rapid detection of expanded pathological alleles [1]. Reliability andfidelity of three PCR methods were demonstrated on the group of MD pos itive control samples provided us by reference laboratories. Using sug gested PCR protocols we have shown the allelic frequency of the CTGrepeats on the group of MD patients in correlation with control one. In MDpatients amplified alleles range from about 100 CTG to more (unlimited)CTG repeats. The 5 CTG allele was presented only in 5% still much lowerthan for control individuals (about 40%). Clinically affected subjects werecorrectly identified by introduced PCR methods and confirmed by South ern blot analysis as recommended [2]. [1] Falk M. et al. J. Biomol.

736, muenchen.deSupernumerary marker chromosomes are small extra chromosomes(ESACS) that are unidentifiable by cytogenetic banding analyses alonedue to their small size and lack of distinct banding pattern. The incidenceof marker chromosomes has been estimated in different studies to rangebetween 0.4/1000 and 1.5/1000. Precise identification leads to a betterunderstanding of the origin of these chromosomes and their effect on thephenotype. However a detailed characterization of ESACs is a diagnosticchallenge. The majority of marker chromosomes is derived from acrocen tric chromosomes and consists merely of heterochromatin. In these cases 24 color karyotyping techniques such as M FISH are not helpful ashybridisation to ESACs composed of only heterochromatin would beexpected to be completely suppressed because of the addition of Cot1 DNA. However a diagnosis based on a missing signal is problematic incases of a poor hybridization efficiency. Thus we generated a specialhybridization mix termed acro mix . We developed a strategy for thesimultaneous hybridization of whole chromosome painting probes andrepetitive DNA probes. The acro mix consists of painting probes for chro mosomes 13 14 15 21 and 22 of centromere probes for chromosomes13/21 14/22 and 15 and a probe for rDNA all labelled in different color combinations. Until now we analyzed eight marker chromosomes with theacro mix. Half of them were unidentifiable with M FISH because there wasno staining with whole chromosome painting probes. The advantage of thisnew hybridization mix is a very rapid and precise identification of ESACSeven if the metaphase quality is poor. For a rapid work up in prenatal diag nosis we propose to use a combination of both M FISH and the acro mix to decipher the composition of an ESAC. ,2001
737,We have initiated studies on incidence rate and clinical heterogeneity ofthe syndrome in 5 million population of St. Petersburg. CT MRT EEG andchromosome analysis have been used. The most frequent form was Reck linghausen neurofibromatosis 94 patients from 71 families. CT with sub sequent histology revealed optical nerve gliomas (2 cases) astrocytomas(2 cases) epindimoma of CNS (1 case) acoustic nerve neurinoma (1case) and some another tumours. Ataxia teleangiectasia (Louis Bar) wasin 10 patients without family traits of the disease. One of them had a chro mosomal aberration (48 XX +6 +8 t(7 14)(q36 q11). Klippel Trenaunay Weber syndrome was revealed in 7 patients (3 of them were from one fam ily). Typical encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis (Sturge Weber syndrome)was in 22 patients ( from 19 families). We observed a family with 5 femalepatients of pigment incontinence (Bloch Sulzberger syndrome). The cuta neous changes were localized on lateral surfaces of the trunk and extrem ities. The disease had X linked dominant type with lethal effect for the malefetuses. The analysis of the main clinical symptoms showed early mani festations of different forms of phacomatoses high frequency of familycases increased risk of the neoplastic processes. The early diagnosis pro vides an opportune medical genetic family counseling improves recog naizing of tumours and follow up of patients. Proposals of joint investiga tions of clinical heterogeneity and clinico molecular correlation in the syn drome are warmly welcome. ,2001
738,In 1962 Dyggve Melchior and Clausen published 3 mentally retarded sibswith a peculiar bone dysplasia resembling Morquio s disease. Smith andMcCort in 1958 were the first to describe patients with this pattern of bonechanges and normal intelligence. Both conditions share identical radiolog ical signs Spinal cord compression due to atlantoaxial instability is a seri ous and preventable complication of both disorders. We provide the firstreport of a Turkish patient with the rare skeletal dysplasia Smith McCortDysplasia (SMC) and the first report of a Georgian (Russia) sibpair withthe related Dyggve Melchior Clausen disease (DMC). Early detection in a14 month old Lebanese girl of DMC with mild skeletal findings is demon strated. We found some further features in this condition such as delayedpuberty in a 15 year old patient. Anal prolapse observed for the third time in one of our patients seems to be a feature associated with the condition. Different degrees of mental retardation within one family were noted. Hyperactive behavior in one patient with DMC is reported here for the sec ond time. Morphological criteria such as phenotype radiological and elec tron microscopical findings do not allow differentiation of DMC from SMC. The presence of mental retardation in all cases of DMC sometimesaccompanied by microcephaly and its absence in all cases of SMC is adiscriminating factor. There is no overlap of both conditions in any family ofthe literature nor in our familial patients. This finding together with the geo graphic distribution the uniform autosomal recessive mode of inheritancein DMC and the heterogeneous situation in SMC leads us to assume thatthese conditions are separate entities.

Mutation carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer sus ceptibility genes) have a life time risk of 80 90% to develop breast cancerand of 20 40% to develop ovarian cancer. The last 3? years we counseled615 women from 453 families with a family history of breast and ovariancancer in our breast cancer clinic. Material and Method We analyzed theBRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 119 families by direct sequencing andDHPLC. All individuals were counseled by an gynecologist psychologistand geneticist. All women were offered a intensive breast and ovarian can cer screening program (self examination clinical examination mammog raphy MRI ultrasound of breast vaginal ultrasound and serum CA125starting at age 25). Prophylactic surgery was discussed as an optiondepending on the individual situation. Results 569 women participated inthe screening program (compliance 92%). We detected 30 breast cancerscases. All incident cases were diagnosed in an early stage of cancerbefore spread (pTis or pT1 pN0 M0). Four women requested prophylac tic bilateral mastectomy and 20 prophylactic oophorectomy. We identifiedBRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in 39 families (19 of them being unclassifiedvariants). A predictive genetic testing was performed in 34 unaffectedwomen 28 women were tested negative (proven noncarriers) and could bereassured. Six women were tested positive (proven carriers). In 80 familiesBRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were excluded. Conclusions Our preliminaryresults indicate that women from high risk families may benefit fromincreased surveillance and prophylactic therapy. A special screening pro gram helps to identify early stages of breast cancer. Further studies areneeded to prove a reduction of mortality rates.

739,Computer programs which can be used as an aid to diagnose multiple con genital malformation syndromes have been used for many years. Theseprograms are based either on algorithms which define a diagnosis by a setof phenotypic components all having the same weight or on algorithmsbased on a concept of Bayesian statistics. A third and new approach forthis field are artificial neuronal networks (ANNs) which are popular as clas sification mechanisms in medical decision support systems. As a softwaretool we took the commercially available shell ORKA which is suitable forbuilding up feedforeward ANNs trained using backpropagation of errors. We used data from 234 patients representing individual examples of 21 dif ferent established syndromes. For the description of the cases the num bers of symptoms were limited to 55. After the export of the patient data toORKA the data of 161 patients were used for the training of the ANN theremaining 73 patient data sets were used to test the diagnostic abilities ofthe different ANNs. A diagnosis was yielded in 96% of all tests. The per centage of correct diagnoses suggested by the ANNs without concurrentdifferential diagnoses was 23% taking all tests during which the correctdiagnosis was produced among other diagnoses amounted to 68% onlyin 11% of all tests the correct diagnosis was calculated with a small prob ability. The application of ANNs during the diagnostic process of malfor mation syndromes is promising also one shortcoming is that different setsof training data produce models with different generalisation accuracies. The value of a ANN is to a great extent influenced by luck instinct andexperience of the developer. ,2001
740,Many beta globin gene defects leading to hemoglobinopathies are known. Most of these hemoglobin variants have been identifies at the protein levelby alkaline electrophoresis but the underlying molecular defect has notbeen determined for many hemoglobinopathies. Advanced moleculargenetic techniques offer the possibility of identifying the under lying muta tions in these variants. Hemoglobin D Los Angeles is the most commonD hemoglobin. We have analyzed A family with a beta thalassemia sus pect and founded a hemoglobin variant similar to hemoglobin S at alkalineelectrophoresis. In the analyses by HPLC on the Bio Rad variant auto mated analyzer we found a sample whit retention time similar to hemoglo bin D Los Angeles confirmed by DNA analysis. ,2001

742,Background Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome is a syndrome of multiple con genital malformations with growth retardation severe mental retardation microcephalia genital anomaly and unfavorable life outcome. Biochemicalbasis of the syndrome is deficient cholesterol synthesis caused by mal function of 7 dehydrocholesterol reductase which was mapped to thechromosome 11q12 q13. This leads to accumulation of a toxic metabolite7 dehydrocholesterol which subsequently associates with the family ofsonic hedgehogs signaling proteins important during embyogenesis. Case report the index case described was a full term boy of physiologicalpregnancy. Because of perinatal asphyxia he was one week in incubator. Hypotonia and degenerative sings were observed early after birth and hispsychomotorical development soon became delayed. A clinical diagnosisof SLO syndrome was made. Methods HPTLC was developed for identification of 7 DHC. Serum wasdeproteinized with acetone 25 l put of Merck Kieselgel 60 plate and chro matographed twice in hexane+ethylacetate 10+1.5. A blue fluorescentproduct visible at 360nm of 7 DHC was developed after derivatization withsulphuric acid. Subsequent DNA analysis of mutations in 7 DHCR gene(W151X V326L IVS8nt1g c L109P and R446Q) was done. Results and Conclusions Diagnosis of SLO was established by identifica tion of 7 DHC in serum of the index case by a new HPTLC method andconfirmed by DNA analysis with following results proband V326L/V326L father V326L mother V326L At the age of 6 years patient clinical condi tions appear stable. Currently high cholesterol therapy is being adminis tered. ,2001
743, marburg.deCHILD syndrome (Congenital Hemidysplasia with Ichthyosiform nevus andLimb Defects) is an X linked dominant male lethal trait characterized by aninflammatory nevus affecting usually one side of the body with strict mid line demarcation associated with ipsilateral hypoplasia of the brain lung kidney heart limbs and skeletal structures. Recently we found CHILDsyndrome to be caused by mutations in the gene NSDHL [NAD(P)H steroiddehydrogenase like protein] encoding a putative 3ÃÂ§ hydroxysteroid dehy drogenase that functions in a late step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Thishuman gene maps to Xq28. Two murine X linked dominant male lethaltraits bare patches (Bpa) and striated (Str) are associated with mutationsin the homologous mouse gene Nsdhl. We describe NSDHL mutants observed in 16 CHILD patients from 12 families (15 females and onemale). None of the changes in NSDHL was detected in 100 control per sons. Thus CHILD syndrome is added to the list of developmental defectscaused by an enzymatic deficiency in cholesterol biosynthesis. In spite ofthe fact that the murine Nsdhl mutations affect similar protein regions asthe human ones one mutation is even completely identical the striking lat eralization of the skin defect occurs in humans only. The lateralizedhypoplasia might result from the absence of NSDHL function in organizercells determining one side of the body. We conclude that CHILD syndromeidentifies a gene that plays a pivotal role at an early stage of human devel opment when the formation of the primitive streak confers bilateral sym metry on the embryonic disk and left right asymmetry is determined. ,2001
744,Mutations in the gene for connexin 26 (CX26) GJB2 are a major cause ofautosomal recessive inherited and apparently sporadic non syndromiccongenital hearing loss (locus DNFB1). The frameshift mutation 35delG isthe most represented in Caucasoid populations with a variable relative fre quency. We have analyzed 88 unrelated patients affected by sensorineur al deafness with various degrees of hearing loss. Audiological characteris tics were investigated and the entire coding region of GJB2 wassequenced. GJB2 mutations were present in 37 (56%) of 66 cases ofsevere/profound deafness while three GJB2 mutations were found in 22patients with moderate deafness (13%). The most common mutation is35delG accounting for 66% of all deafness alleles. The mutation V95Mand E47X were detected four and two times with a relative frequency of 5and 2.5% respectively. Other mutations (L90P 290 291 insA 334 delAA W24X E119del) were detected once. We also found six allele variants ofunknown significance (V37I F83L R127H V153I and the novel allelesQ80P and M162V) all in heterozygosity in deaf patients but also in normal hearing subjects. While the search of mutations in CX26 is fundamental forgenetic counselling the goal is now to clarify the role of the missensemutations of unknown significance in the pathogenesis of hearing loss. This will allow to appropriate genetic counselling with valuable prognosticand therapeutic informations. ,2001
745,The diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies is of growing importance particularybecause of an increasing requirement for antenatal diagnosis of significant disorders of globin chain synthesis. The identification of hemoglobins isoften presumptive based on a characteristic electrophoretic mobility orother characteristics in an individual of appropriate ethnic origin. Brazil is acountry with a special ethnic characteristic. The hemoglobinopathies diag nosis has a considerable importance and reflects racial composition andgeographic origin. Scientific sanitary social and cultural factors explain aquantitative and qualitative subestimation of the structural variants ofhemoglobin. The cellulose acetate electrophoresis is an easy fast andreproductible method to identify abnormal hemoglobins. We have analyzedblood samples with mobility as hemoglobin S detected on celluloseacetate by HPLC on the Bio Rad variant automated analyzer methodolo gy and Isoelectric focusing. Applications of these methods greatly aided indefining the different hemoglobinopathies. like hemoglobin Korle Bu G Philadelphia and D Los Angeles. Accurate identification of hemoglobinvariants is important not only to understand the clinical course but also insome cases for proper clinical management especially in those casesinvolving hemoglobin S. The determination of rare variants may also assistin family studies or genetic counseling. ,2001
746,Fetal hemoglobin is produced in a sub population of erythrocytes termed F Cells and is the predominant hemoglobin in fetal life and early infancy. Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 211During the first year of life fetal hemoglobin is gradually replaced by hemo globin A and only small amounts of fetal hemoglobin can be found in adultlife fetal hemoglobins levels were shown to be increasing in some subjectswith hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin and beta thalassemia. Wefound blood donors whit high levels of fetal hemoglobin on celluloseacetate electrophoresis screening and confirmed by the alkali denaturationmethod and HPLC on the Bio Rad variant automated analyzer. The fami ly studies and DNA analysis will be made to evaluate which molecularmechanism are envolved in these cases. ,2001
747,Our collaborative study with the Centre of Assistant Reproduction startingfrom the 1998 year was focused on the group of 159 infertile men as can didates for ICSI and IVF programme. Cytogenetic examinations havedetected chromosomal abnormalities in 16 infertile men. Chromosomalabnormalities have represented 10% of pathological cytogenetic findings. Recently the number of reports documented the prevalence of Yqmicrodeletions in infertile men. We have examined the group of 143 infer tile men with karyotype 46 XY on the microdeletion DNA test in locusYq11 23 for DAZ (deleted in azoospermia) gene and found microdeletionsin specific fragments sY277 sY283 (AZFc region) with prevalence of 18%in 44 azoospermic or severe oligospermic series patients from our testedgroup. Recently DNA analyse of 12 cystic fibrosis transmembrane con ductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations in group 159 of infertile mendemonstrated genotype Ã\x98F508/nonÃ\x98F508 in 6 patients (4 were included inthe azoospermic series). Also it was analysed a DNA variant (the 5T alele)in a noncoding region of intron 8 CFTR gene that caused reduced levels ofthe normal CFTR protein. It has detected the 13 men carrying 5T allelicvariant one man was homozygote for genotype 5T/5T two men with geno type Ã\x98F508/5T in relation to the congenital absence of the vas deferens. Our results of the complex screening programme in infertile men from theMoravia region demonstrate in 27% causes that chromosomal and gene disorders make a significant contribution to spermatogenic imparment. ,2001
748,Eighty five families of haemophiliac patients of India (Haemophilia A=75 Haemophilia B=10) were examined to assess the carrier status of thefemales in this pedigree dataset. The probability values of the females forbeing carrier were calculated by the Bayesian method. It was observedthat 45 mothers were proven carriers and 40 probable .The transmissionwas of familial nature in 45 families with 37 families having well establishedhistory of the disorder whereas in the remaining 8 the trait showed up inpropositus and his brothers i.e. only in one generation. The remaining 40were categorised as isolated cases where the propositus was the onlyhaemophiliac affected. On the basis of type of mutation 22 cases wereobserved to be due to de novo mutations in haemophiliac and the rest 18were the cases where there was an equal chance of mutation taking placeeither in the mother or in the propositus itself. The probability values of 425females in 37 familial cases were calculated and a wide range of probabil ity values fluctuating from 0.0295 to 1 was observed. ,2001
749,Late diagnostics of hereditary diseases of a skeleton results in delayed andwrong treatment and is the reason for invalidized complications. The roentgenograms of the lower extremities of 22 children 2 and 3 yearsold are examined with the purpose of revealing early radiology differentialattributes of the metaphysaric chondrodysplasia of the Shmid type. Roentgenogrammetric parameters of were offered for the objectivization ofthe research data a cervicodiaphysial index (the relation of a neck diame ter of a femoral bone to of a diaphysis diameter of a bone) a metaphysar ic index (relation of width distal metaphysis of a femoral bone to a diame ter of its diaphysis). The cervicodiaphysial index on the average wasequaled to 1 38Ã¢\x80\x930 035 and authentically was not differed from that param eter of a control group. The metaphysaric index was on the average3 37Ã¢\x80\x930 079 and was authentically differed from a control group (3 15Ã¢\x80\x930 019 t 5 23 p<0 01). The height of a distalsprout zone of a femoralbone from the internal and outside parties was accordingly 6 62Ã¢\x80\x930 38 and3 32Ã¢\x80\x930 21. The varus deformation of the lower extremities changed from150 up to 162 degrees. 12 men had the structure of necks changed and17 patients had the structure of internal departments of distal metaphysesof a femoral bone changed. Thus the characteristic picture of the metaphysaric chondrodysplasia ofthe Shmid type was characterized with the varus deformation of the lowerextremities change of structure of necks and distal metaphyses of afemoral bone presence of the metaphysaric index of a femoral bone with in the limits of 3 37Ã¢\x80\x930 079 and almost double excess of height of a sproutzone from the inside in the area of the distal end of a femoral bone. ,2001
750,Machado Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegerative disorder associatedwith a CAG repeat expansion in a gene or chromosome 14q32.1. A recentsurvey of MJD in the 9 islands of the Azores (Portugal) identified 103cases which represents a prevalence of 1 in 2309 individuals. In theAzorean island of Flores the disease has its highest world wide preva lence (1 in 103 people affected). To evaluate the clinical characteristics onset and disease duration with reference to CAG repeat length we per formed a detailed clinical analysis of 20 Azorean patients. The age of onsetwas inversely correlated with the repeat length confirming previous find ings. Repeat length in the expanded allele did not overlap that of normalallele. The relationship between the number of CAG repeat units and sev eral clinical finding was extensively studied. The influence of the normalallele on disease presentation was also analysed. The results obtained fur ther document the importance of the repeat length in the phenotypic vari ation of MJD. ,2001
751,The most common variant of ectodermal dysplasia is its anhydrotic form(EDA) mostly caused by mutations in two genes EDA gene localised onthe X chromosome and EDAR gene localised on chromosome 2. Theaffected individuals exhibit symptoms of anodontia or oligodontia deficien cy of sweat glands and hypotrichosis. EDA is caused by improper interac tions between the cells of ectodermal and mesenchymal origin duringembryogenesis. This interaction depends on protein products of EDA andEDAR genes belonging to TNF family of ligands and receptors respec tively. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 16 individu als. Fragments of DNA corresponding to exons 1 through 9 of EDA geneand exons 1 through 12 of EDAR gene were amplified by PCR using spe cific primers. The fragments that exhibited aberrant banding patterns inSSCP analysis were sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer. In 5patients mutations in the EDA gene were detected. In one of the remain ing patients sequence analysis demonstrated a novel T1109C transition inexon 12 of EDAR gene resulting in Val370Ala substitution in the deathdomain of EDAR protein. However in 10 affected individuals sequenceanalysis demonstrated no mutations in both EDA and EDAR genes. It waspostulated that about 30% of the cases of anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasiaresults form mutations in the gene encoding the ligand (ectodysplasin A) and the receptor (EDAR). The remaining 70% of the cases were probablydue to mutations of the other recently described genes XEDAR and NFkBessential modulator (NEMO). Supported by KBN grant 4PO5A05417 ,2001
752,The dominant autosomal ataxias are a group of neurodegenerative disor ders caused by expanssion of a CAG triplet repeates in different genes. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7(SCA7) is a degenerative disorder whichaffects the retina. The trinucleotide repeates in normal individual ranges212 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologyfrom 7 to 16 in affected persons the repeats can exceed over three hun dred. Here we are reporting the first family of SCA7 in Iran. Their motherhas mild syptoms including mild ataxia with bilateral macular degenerativechanges and abnormal cerebellar atrophy in MRI. Her three children areaffected one of them is a 39 year old man who has PMD (pigmentary mac ular dystrophy) with cerebellar ataxia and his children died due to rapidfatal course of early onset disease. Another is a 37 year old man who hascerebellar ataxia and bilateral optic atrophy with blindness. The last one isa 25 year old woman who has PMD and cerebellar ataxia. The others arenormal. Eight members of the family were analysed for the repeats. 6 out8 had the expanded repeats ranges from 40 to 50 in one of the alleles. 2members of the family had normal range of repeats for both alleles. ,2001
753,In families with gonosomal recessive disorders a reliable detection of car riers is crucial. Mutation analysis is widely accepted to be a most effectivediagnostic approach for identification of heterozygotes. We have set upmethods for mutation analysis of X ALD and OTC deficiency. As the muta tions are usually private we start the analysis by direct sequencing of PCRor RT/PCR products amplified from probands gDNA or cDNA. Subse quently family members are genotyped by specific PCR RFLP assays. X ALD is characterized by impaired peroxisomal very long chain fatty acidsbeta oxidation. We have analysed 12 X ALD patients from 11 unrelatedfamilies and found eight novel mutations in ALD gene. In one family muta tion analysiswas used for prenatal diagnosis. OTC deficiency is the mostcommon inborn disorder of the urea cycle. In three patients with neonatalform of OTC deficiency we have identified two novel nonsense mutationsand one published missense mutation. Mutation R277W which wasreported previously was found in four unrelated patients with late onsetform of OTC deficiency. We screened 55 family members for the mutationsfound in probands and identified three presymptomatic boys and 24 het erozygotes. In three cases the mutations found in probands were notdetected in DNA isolated from leukocytes of their mothers obligatory het erozygotes. In the case of these mothers we strongly recommend geneticcounseling and prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies as the discrepan cies observed cannot be explained only by mutation de novo but morelikely by gonadal mosaicism . ,2001
754,Mitochondrion is one of the intracytoplasmic organells that it is called ascell energy generator. Mitochondrion contains circular double strandedDNA (mtDNA) with 16 569 bp in length. mtDNA is very condense and itcontains 37 genes (2 genes for mt rRNA and 22 genes for mt tRNA and 13genes encoding oxidative phosphorylation proteins that need for mostimportant biochemical role of mitochondrion). Every mitochondrion approx imatly has 2 10 copies of mtDNA. There is 100 to 1000 mitochondria inevery cell depending on to cell function. Sperm contains between 70 to100 mitochondria which take plase in midpiece region. Mitochondria aremajor source of energy production for mobility of sperm. By reason of mito chondrial sensitivity role for ATP production and extremely mobility and fer tility of sperm every defect on mtDNA can cause diseases such as Neu rospermia and Asthenozoospermia. To date has recognized different dele tions in the mtDNA such as 7599 bp and 7345 bp and 4977 bp deletionsthat later deletion indicate most frequencies in the low mobility and immo bility of sperm and infertility in men. The purpose of this study are detec tion of deletions in the mtDNA of sperm and correlation between deletionsand infertility in man. Sperm semens was used for DNA and Multiple PCRmethod was used to extraction detect deletions in infertile men as well ashealthy controls. 5 Kb deletion was found in one infertile man. 5 Kb dele tion (common deletion) was reported in aging age of patients is importantto detect this deletion. ,2001
755,Familial cases of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) were first described inthe article by Donohue et al. (Pediatrics 24 (1959) 786 813). They sug gested that there was a genetic basis to familial IPF and proposed an auto somal dominant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance. We haveidentified three descendants with pulmonary disease from one of the orig inal IPF families reported by Donohue et al. (1959). The proband is a 3 year old female who presented at age 17 months with failure to thrive chronic respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia. A lung biopsy revealed apicture of cellular/desquamative interstitial pneumonitis. Her youngerbrother also presented in infancy with persistent respiratory distress. A lungbiopsy taken from him showed similar histological findings to his sister. Thechildren have a 45 year old maternal great uncle with chronic interstitiallung disease secondary to presumed IPF. This individual has recentlyundergone a lung transplant and the pathological findings are pending. The family history was extensively reviewed and has uncovered 8 addi tional confirmed or presumed cases of IPF affecting descendants in fourdifferent generations. The pattern of inheritance is consistent with autoso mal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity. A second autosomaldominant IPF family has been identified through a search of the hospitalrecords. The pedigrees on these two families will be presented and thepathological findings will be reviewed and compared. ,2001
756,As many as 60% of the children with cerebral palsy (CP) do not have adocumented pre . peri or neonatal cause. We report a three generationfamily with CP (see pedigree). The proband III 3 was born by uneventfulvertex delivery with a birth weight of 3010g length 51 cm and head cir cumference 32 cm. Episodes of apnea and reduced right extremitiesmovements led to brain CT and MRI. They showed asymmetric lateral ven tricles due to porencephaly of the left periatrial area. EEG was normal. III 1 was diagnosed as having right spastic hemiparesis at age three months. CT showed similar porencephaly. Subsequently mild microcephaly devel Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 213oped and at age 5 years she has limited speech. Her chromosomes were normal 46 XX. I 1 had right spastic hemiparesis diagnosed during infancy. He is of normal intelligence and his MRI showed left porencephaly com promising the frontoparietal white matter. This pedigree suggests a hered itary developmental porencephaly due to faulty neuron migration and lead ing to CP. The trait appears to be autosomal dominant with reduced pene trance II 1 and II 2 are asymptomatic with pending MRI. There are a fewreports of similar families. Seizures and bilateral porencephaly were addi tional manifestations in some of the affected individuals. By adding thisfamily to the reports a trait of proencephaly with CP is established. ,2001
757,The analysis of an X ray research of bones of 152 children aged from 2 to16 years with rachitislike diseases a phosphatic diabetes (84 men) a renaltubular acidosis (36) an illness of DeTony Debre Franckony (25) a vita min D dependent rachitis (7) was done. All patients were divided into three groups depending on the hardness of disease display. There were 101 (66 4 %) child with moderately expresseddisplays in the first group 4 patients (27 %) with the average hardness ofdisplay in the second group and 10 men (16 6 %) with serious changeswere referred to the third group. The varus deformation of the lower extremities osteoporosis of the hyper trophic type advancing of an osteal age on 2 3 years were defined in thefirst and second groups of the patients with the phosphatic diabetes. Patients from all three groups with the renal tubular acidosis were distin guished by valgus deformation of the lower extremities lagging of theosteal age and atrophic osteoporosis. The first and the second groups of children with the illness of DeTony Debre Franckony were characterised with valgus deformation of the lowerextremities atrophic osteoporosis and moderate lagging of the osteal age. The resorption of a cortical layer of a diaphysis of tubular bones wasdetermined in the third group side by side the expressed osteoporosis. In the first and the second groups of patients with the vitamin D dependentrachitis were defined varus deformations hypertrophic osteoporosis con forming of osteal age to Passport age and there was a tendency to lag ging of the osteal age in the third group. Thus the realization of differential diagnostics is possible at mild and aver age hardness of displays of rachitislike diseases. At a serious degree of disease authentic differential radiologic attributes of various forms of rachi tislike diseases are absent. ,2001
758,A total of 3244 children of age group 0 15 yrs presenting severe visualimpairment or blindness were registered at Aravind Eye Hospital S. Indiaduring November 1995 through July 1996. Of these Bilateral ChildhoodCataracts (BCCs) accounted for 19% (611/3244) representing nonsyn dromic (N=468) and syndromic (N=143) cases. Of the eleven phenotypesregistered lamellar total and nuclear were the most frequently encoun tered clinical entities. Age at appearance amongst non syndromic BCCswere mostly developmental betweeen the age group 1 15 yrs while it wascongenital/infantile (0 1 yr) in phenotypes such as total nuclear and ante rior polar BCCs. Lamellar and posterior polar were most often develop mental. About 70% (426/611) of the BCCs reveal a probable genetic basisand in 28% (171/611) the aetiology was undetermined. Fifty two percent ofthe syndromic BCCs were associated with ocular anomalies with micro cornea being the most frequent anomaly followed by microphthalmos andbuphthalmos/glaucoma. Among nonocular associations delayed mile stones/mental retardation was most common. Both ocular and nonocularmalformations were present in about 26% of the BCC probands. Few ofthe syndromal cases include those of Marfan (N=6) Down (N=1) Haller mann Strieff (N=1) and Bardet Biedl (N=1) syndromes. Thus the clinicalprofile of the BCC phenotypes documents clinical variation and the underlying genetic heterogeneity in this ethnic group. ,2001
759,Several mutations in the human mitochondrial genome result in non syn dromic sensorineural hearing loss. Among them the A1555G mutation inthe gene encoding the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA confers suscep tibility to the ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics but it also causesnon syndromic hearing impairment in absence of exposure to these antibi otics. In this work we have found the A1555G mutation in 64 out of 345families with non syndromic hearing loss so confirming the high frequen cy of this mutation in the Spanish population. In most of the cases themutation was found in homoplasmy but in five families heteroplasmy wasdetected. The percentage of mutant copies was determined in a total of 16heteroplasmic individuals and it ranges from 4% to 97%. In 14 of theseindividuals the hearing level was normal for middle frequencies (500 to2000 Hz) but a significant loss in high frequencies (4000 and 8000 Hz)was observed in individuals with a percentage of mutant copies higher than70%. In some but not all of the families the percentage of mutant copiescorrelates with the severity of the hearing loss. Our results indicate thatother factors (age and genetic background i.e. putative nuclear modifiergenes) may also modulate the phenotype associated to the A1555G muta tion. ,2001
760,A 58 year old female comes to our attention for focal cryptogenic epilepsy. She was treated with valproic acid and during this therapy she developedmental slowing and stroke like episodes characterized by ataxia nystag mus and cephalea an increase of rest lactacidemia was recorded. Shewas addressed to the molecular analysis with the clinical hypothesis of aMelas syndrome. We identify a novel heteroplasmic mutation C8393T inND5 gene (CCC >TCC Pro >Ser). Heteroplasmia was assessed withRFLP Ava II enzyme on DNA from blood and skeletal muscle the quanti tative densitometric evaluation showed 85% and 95% mutant in blood andmuscle DNA respectively. Three unaffected siblings carried the mutation tested in blood DNA. The mutation was absent in 150 consecutive normalcontrols and present in one of 160 patients screened for dilated cardiomy opathy. One homoplasmic polymorphism (G1719A in 16s rRNA) was alsoidentified in the same patient. Given that the mutation is heteroplasmic absent from normal controls only found in 1 disease control and theamount of mutant segregates with affected tissue we suspected that thismutation is likely to play some pathogenetic role in the disease. After theidentification of the mutation the patient withdrew valproic acid with animmediate and persistent (6 months) clinical benefit. ,2001
761,Leber optic atrophy is due to atrophy of the retinal ganglion cell and nervefiber layers as well as of the optic nerve. The penetrance of the disease isestimated to be 20% for men and 4% for women. Many characteristic fea tures of LHON such as the long latency to onset the acute nature of thevission loss and clinical involment confined to the optic nerve are notexplained adequately. The effect of common mutation (677 C to T) of themethylenetetahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have been studied infive unrelated leber patients live in different regions in IRAN. The patho genicity of any mtDNA mutaions have been fairly known but a definitivecause and effect relationship between an mtDNA mutation and a clinicalphenotype can be difficult to establish. Different mutations can be associ ated with the same phenotype the same mutation can be associated with214 Posters: Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphologydifferent phenotypes. Both LHON disease and folic acid methabolism prob lem can be involved in common neurodegenrative symptomes such asAlzhimer disease but the relationship of mtDNA disease such as LHONand MTHFR mutation has not been studied before. This study is uniqe instuding this mutation amoung LHON patients and showing the pervalenceof 100% of heterozyous mutation of 677 C to T substitution in five studiedLHON patients. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in thesepatients are at the present time not very well known. However theseobservations may be useful for study of LHON pathogenesis. ,2001
762,Anti ? hemoglobin chain antibody has been used to detect fetal nucleatedred blood cells (NRBCs) entering maternal circulation during pregnancy. Ina previous study we demonstrated however that women carriers of ? tha lassemia produce themselves during pregnancy an increased number of?+ NRBC making it difficult to distinguish between fetal and maternalNRBCs. Use of Ab against embryonic hemoglobin ? may increase speci ficity for fetal NRBCs. In the present study NRBCs were isolated by MACSfrom 20ml peripheral blood of 50 pregnant women carriers of ? tha lassemia trait 27 in the first and 23 in the second trimester of pregnancy. NRBCs were next identified immunocytochemically using anti ? or anti ?monoclonal antibodies (MoAb). FISH was performed in 22 cases known tocarry male fetuses with X/Y chromosome specific probes. The mean num ber of NRBCs isolated with anti ? was 51 (range 14 158) in the 1 sttrimester and 52 (range 22 153) in the 2nd. Using anti ? an average of 12 (range 3 23) NRBC were identfied in the 1stand 5 (range 3 10) in the 2ndtrimester of pregnancy. When anti ? was used all cells identified were XY. In contrastwhen anti ? was used FISH identified both XX and XY NRBCs. Our resultsdemonstrate that since anti ?MoAb shows increased specificity for fetalNRBC it should be preferentially used in the first trimester of pregnancy toimrove prenatal diagnosis from fetal cells isolated from maternal circulationand facilitate distinction between fetal and maternal NRBCs especially inwomen carriers of ? thalassemia. ,2001
763,In a previous study we demonstrated that apoptosis increased accordingto gestational age accounting partly for the presence of free fetal DNA inmaternal plasma and serum. Using simultaneously TUNEL assay andFISH analysis we identified the fetal origin of part of the apoptotic cell pop ulation but very few TUNEL+ cells showed hybridization signals since theywere in a late apoptosis stage and nuclei were distorted. In the presentstudy apoptotic cell population was identified immunocytochemically usingAnnexin V a marker of cells in an early stage of apoptosis. Apoptosis wasdetermined in mononuclear cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 29pregnant women in the 16th 19th week of pregnancy. The mean apoptosisrate using Annexin V was 6.8Ã¢\x80\x930.5% (range 4.2 8.1%) vs 6.14Ã¢\x80\x930.5%(range 3.7 6.9) obtained using the ethidium bromide staining. FISH usingX and Y chromosome specific probes was applied in 17 cases known tocarry male fetuses. The proportion of apoptotic cells showing X/Y signalswas 7.8% (range 5 12%) while 75% of Annexin V + cells showedhybridization signals. In 12 samples from women with female fetuses noX/Y cells were recorded. Although our results are still preliminary it seemsthat use of Annexin V antibody to detect apoptotic cell population improvesFISH analysis and allows a more accurate determination of the proportionof fetal cells among the apptotic cell population. ,2001
764,Porencephaly is a rare central nervous system abnormality and is rarelyassociated with syndromes. Here we report on a prenatal diagnosis ofcomplex central nervous system abnormalities including agenesis of thecorpus callosum agenesis of the cerebellar vermis bilateral hydrocephaly and multiple cystic porencephaly in a 33 WG foetus. Termination of preg nancy was proposed after genetic counselling. Autopsy showed a femalefoetus with macrocephaly (W 1615g L 43cm and OFC 32cm) unilateralpostaxial polydactyly on the hand and unilateral preaxial polydactyly onfeet. Facial dysmorphism included hypertelorism epicanthus hypoplasticnasal alae left choanal atresia midline pseudocleft of upper lip multilobu lated tongue with oral hamartoma and multiple gingival frenulae. Clinicalexamination of the family revealed that the mother sister and maternalgrandmother of the proband were affected and family history argued infavor of an X linked dominant inheritance pattern. This is the fourth reportof porencephaly in association with orofaciodigital syndrome type I and isanother example of a large intrafamilial variability. This report raise twoissues i) the difficulties in genetic counselling of orofaciodigital syndrometype I families due to the great variability of the disease and ii) the impor tance of a detailed ultrasound examination after a prenatal diagnosis ofporencephaly. ,2001
765,Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) is the most common type of lethal skeletaldysplasia (LSD). Most of the prenatally diagnosed cases show abnormalultrasound findings in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Thereare reports of cases of TD diagnosed during the early second trimester aswell as cases of normal sonograms at 12 13 weeks of fetuses subse quently shown to be affected. Moreover while a general diagnosis of LSDcan be reliably made by ultrasound a specific disease diagnosis remainsoften difficult. We observed a case of TD type I suspected at 18 weeks ofgestation during a routine ultrasound scan. The main findings were abnor mally short and bowed long bones extremely small thoracic circumferenceand a typical telephone receiver appearance of the femurs. We were ableto analyse genomic DNA obtained by chorionic villus sampling identifyinga C to G substitution at position 746 in the fibroblast growth factor recep tor (FGFR) 3 gene resulting in a Ser249Cys substitution already known tobe associated with TD type I disease. While ultrasound scans remain themost important clue to suspect the disease genetic molecular analysis ofTD associated mutations on CVS samples can be of great help in earlydefinition of the diagnosis and in genetic counselling. ,2001
766,The analysis of Doppler waveforms of fetal ductus venosus flow has beenproposed as a second level screening test for Down s syndrome in fetus es with increased nuchal translucency thickness. Limiting invasive kary otyping to fetuses with abnormal flow could dramatically reduce the num ber of procedures minimally affecting the detection rate. However sinceno data are available on the reproducibility of this technique we assessedthe intra and inter observer repeatability of fetal ductus venosus Dopplermeasurements at 11 14 weeks of gestation. Waveforms were recordedtransabdominally. Intra observer repeatability was studied in 22 fetuses inwhom four repeated measurements were performed by the same observ er. Inter observer repeatability was assessed in 54 fetuses in each of whom two observers performed two repeated measurements. The pul satility index for veins (PIV) peak systolic velocity (S wave) peak velocityduring atrial contraction (A wave) and time averaged maximum velocity(TAMV) were recorded. The coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass cor relation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. Cohen s k coefficient was usedfor categorical data. Both intra observer and inter observer variations werelow (intra observer CV of 10 13 22 and 13% and ICC of 0.85 0.94 0.94and 0.95 inter observer CV of 8.8 14 22 and 13% and an ICC of 0.86 0.84 0.87 and 0.84 respectively for PIV S wave A wave and TAMV).There was 100% agreement for the detection of normal/abnormal bloodflow. In summary intra and inter observer repeatability of all parameterswas acceptable suggesting that the test could be reliably employed in clin ical practice after further validation in larger series. ,2001
767,Most fetuses with cytogenetic abnormalities have structural anomalies which can be recognized by detailed ultrasound examination. Objective During 1978 1999 amniocentesis was performed on 16 604 pregnantwomen. Retrospective study of routine ultrasound was performed to estab lish correlation between cytogenetic karyotyping and ultrasound in thedetection of chromosomal abnormalities. The main indications for kary otyping are ultrasound suspection of fetal malformations ultrasound sus pection of growth retardation hydramnios and olygohydramnios. Results 360 medical record charts of women with ultrasound as a major indicationfor prenatal diagnosis were reviewed. Karyotypes were available in allcases. Of the 360 documented karyotypes 27 chromosomal abnormalitieswere discovered (7.5%). Detected chromosomal abnormalities includedone triploidy 69 XXX one triploidy 69 XXY ten trisomy 18 seven trisomy21 one trisomy 9 six monosomy 45X and one balanced translocation46 XX t(10 11) (q24 q13). Conclusion A ultrasound detectable fetal defectis a useful marker for detection of chromosomal abnormality. ,2001

769, saude.ptHoloprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common developmental defect ofthe forebrain and midface in humans occurs with a frequency of about 1in 16 000 live births and about 1 in 200 spontaneous abortion. Although themajority cases of HPE exhibit normal karyotypes chromosomal disordersare not uncommon. At least 12 different loci have been associated withHPE and now several distinct human genes for holoprosencephaly havebeen localized (21q22.3 on 2p21 on 7q36 on 13q32 and on 18p). Wereport a case of a 30 year old pregnant woman with an abnormal scan at19 weeks of gestation. She had a normal obstetric history with a phe notipically normal son. In the present pregnancy the fetus presented holo prosencephaly. Amniocentesis for cytogenetic evaluation was performed. Chromosome analysis of cultured amniocytes with GTG banding showeda apparently balance reciprocal translocation 46 XX t(1q15q)(q32q26.1).Karyotype of parents were referred and demonstrated to be normal. To ourknowledge this is the first case of holoprosencephaly and a chromosomeanomaly involving these chromosomes. A bibliographic review is present ed where association of holoprosencephaly and chromosome anomaliesare discussed. ,2001
770,A case of Desbuquiois syndrome diagnosed prenatally is reported. A 32 year old Asian Indian gravida 3 and para 2 was referred for evaluationafter a routine ultrasound examination at 22 weeks of gestation. The ultra sound revealed skeletal dysplasia with bilateral clubbed feet. The consan guinity was involved and the husband is patient s first cousin. There wasno history of skeletal dysplasia or any other genetic disease in the family. The cytogenetic analysis was 46 XX karyotype. All long bones measure<10%ile. The ribs measure at the 45%ile for 22 weeks of gestation. Thechest circumference was at 15th 30th%ile. Bilateral syndactyly of second third digits of right hand and third fourth and fifth digits of left hand wasnoted. The toes of both feet seemed unusually long. After gentic counsel ing the couple chose for the termination of pregnancy. Autopsy findingsshowed the long bones of lower and upper extremities were short narrowface with high forehead arched confluent eyebrows posteriorly rotatedprominent and dysplastic ears proximal syndactyly of toes 2 and 3 micrognathia. X ray examination revealed supernumerary ossification cen ters between proximal phalanx and second metacarpal of the index andring fingers. The diagnostic patterns based on the supernumerary ossifi cation and extreme shortening of the long bones in this autosomal reces sive skeletal dysplasia are discussed. ,2001
771,Prenatal Genetic Diagnostics / PGD / was practised in seven ClinicalGenetic Departements of Slovakia in 1991. Nowadays twelve ClinicalGenetic Departments perform PGD in Slovakia two of which provide DNAanalysis. Fetal sonographic examinations are routinely performed threetimes during gravidity of every mother in 10th 20th and 30th week of ges tation. Sonographic identification of fetal aneuploidy markers is currentlynot regularly used. Standard procedure of obstetric care provides screen ing test of maternal serum alpha fetoprotein which we offer to all pregnantwomen between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation. We also offer the triple marker screening for aneuploidy (including software analysis) only to partof population of pregnant women. In Slovakia 16 051 of prenatal geneticanalyses were done between 1991 1999. There were following indicationsfor PGD 44.7% maternal age of 35 and higher 29.8% positive maternalserum screening 11.2% high genetic risk 2.5 % sonographic identificationof fetal anomaly or positive sonographic markers for aneuploidy. Therewere found 319 /i.e. 2%/ of chromosomal anomalies. We determinedpathological mutations in 27 fetuses from 116 prenatal DNA analyses per formed. Statistics of the birth defects in newborns did not reveal adecrease of birth defects frequency calculated per 10 000 newborns. Thisfrequency fluctuated around 230 240 per 10 000 newborns in period from1991 to 1999. However frequency of newborns with central nervous sys tem anomalies substantially decreased. Annual number of newborns withDown syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies did not decreasethough. From sum of prenatal and postnatal cases of chromosomal anom alies we were able to find 44.9 % by prenatal chromosomal analysis. ,2001
772,A major birth defect is defined as an abnormality of prenatal origin that ifuncorrected or uncorrectable significantly impairs normal physical orsocial function or reduces normal life expectancy. Whilst the infant mortal ity rate in Malaysia has decreased the past 30 years as a result of betterobstetric and neonatal services the percentage of all medically certifiedinfant deaths related to birth defects had risen steadily from 6.2% (1970)to 20.8% (1990). Information on risk factors associated with birth defectsare not well studied in developing countries. We postulated that a hospital based birth defect registry might be able to provide some information onthe magnitude of the problem and identify at risk factors for birth defects inour population. We ascertained these risk factors associated with majorbirth defects in Malaysian births of 24 weeks gestation and above using acase controlled study from a hospital based birth defect registry over a 12 month period. The results showed the incidence of major birth defects tobe 1.8% amongst all births above 24 weeks of gestation and establishedthe baseline incidence of major birth defects in the University of Malaya218 Posters: Prenatal and Perinatal GeneticsMedical Centre in Kuala Lumpur. The majority of major birth defects in Malaysian newborns are potentially detectable antenatally by ultrasonog raphy and karyotyping studies during the first and second trimesters. At risk factors identified for major birth defects were family history of birthdefects adverse past obstetric events low intake of folate / haematinics maternal diabetes poly or oligohydramnios and late or unavailability ofultrasonography in pregnancy. We concluded that the application of appro priate preconceptional care genetic counselling and other preventivestrategies might reduce the incidence of major birth defects and infant mor tality in Malaysia. Larger population based study for birth defects may beable to confirm these observations. ,2001
773,The identification of fetal abnormal chromosomes in high risk pregnancies allows proper pediatric and obstetric management of the cases as well asgenetic counseling. The results of 842 genetic amniocentesis from 1986 to1999 are reported. All procedures were performed transabdominally andunder ultrasound guidance in hospitals of the social security system andin private facilities. There were two main reasons for referral abnormalultrasound assessment (48% of cases) and advanced maternal age (35%).Most procedures (66%) were performed during the second trimester ofpregnancy and 34% during the third trimester. Fetal cells were closed cul tured and suspension harvested. Turn around time was 14 days median. In 217 amniotic fluid samples no diagnosis could be obtained mainly dueto absence of cell growth in late gestation samples and in blood contami nated ones. In 625 fetal karyotypes obtained 55 (9%) were abnormal dueto 33 trisomies (including a robertsonian translocation trisomy 13) eightcases of monosomy X three mosaics (including a mosaic trisomy 22) bal anced and unbalanced translocations extra structurally abnormal chromo somes and other defects. Pseudomosaicism was detected in five cases. Taking into account the reason for referral cases studied as a result ofabnormal ultrasound assessment exhibited 17% abnormal karyotypes incontrast to 2.5% cytogenetic defects in pregnancies of women 35 years orolder. Prenatal cytogenetic and sonographic findings correlated with thephenotype of the newborn in 211 cases available for follow up. Prenataldiagnosis of fetal defects allowed genetic counseling as well as betterobstetric management and pediatric care. Normal results of both tests pro vided reassurance to prospective parents. ,2001
774,Choleostasis of pregnancy is a disease that occurs during the second halfof pregnancy and regresses in puerperium characterised by pruritus andelevated serum bile acid levels. Its etiology remains unknown but proba bly involves the interaction of abnormalities in the metabolism of estrogensand progesterone. Its incidence varies according to geographical area. I. Ch. P. is associated with substantially increased mother morbidity andfetal morbidity and mortality. We report here a detailed clinical history pedi gree and examination obtained from 22 pregnant woman with choleosta sis. In all the cases maternal serum transaminase and bile acid levels weredone and viral and drug induced hepatitis and gallbladder disease wereruled. Ten pedigrees contained two or more cases of I. Ch. P. and six sug gested autosomal recessive inheritance. The incidence of spontaneousabortion and fetal death in the 22 pedigrees was high. The mean maternalage was 32 5 years and the mean gestacional age at the moment of thediagnosis was 32 3 weeks. To reduce the risk of this pathological condition it should be very important that patients have genetic counselling beforeconception in order to plan the pregnancy. ,2001
775,In Estonia (pop. 1.46 million birth rate 13185) prenatal diagnosis of genet ic disorders was introduced into clinical practice in 1990 and is to a greatextent (95%) performed in one center Medical Genetics Center (MGC) ofthe Clinicum of Tartu University . The uptake of invasive prenatal studies isnot high in Estonia. In 1999only 5.5% of pregnancies were monitored byAC or CVS The funding arrangement for PND is the national health insur ance system. Sources of information. Exact records about prenatal inva sive testing in Estonia are kept at the MGC of the Clinicum of Tartu Uni versity . Invasive PND (amniocentesis CVS cordocentesis). Altogether2767 procedures have been done. Abnormalities were detected in 87 (3.1%) cases. For fetal chromosomal analyses we mostly use amniocentesis(97 %). Alltogether 2700 amniocenteses have been done. The main indi cation (69%) has been maternal age. Chromosomal disorder was diag nosed in 71 (2.7%) cases. Chromosome anomalies have been screenedfor advanced maternal age since 1993. In 1999 35 % of women >35 hadfetal karyotypes. Transabdominal CVS we have used only in highrisk preg nancies in 44 cases. Abnormalities were detected in 13 cases (30%). Cor docentesis has been done in highrisk pregnancies in 23 cases. Chromo somal abnormalties were detected in 3 cases (13%) . Maternal serumscreening has been routinely offered since 1998 only in W omen s Clinic of Tartu and since 2000 in Southern Estonia. The impact of PND of chromo somal is increasing every year. During the 1999 year 50% of the trisomy21 cases were detected prenatally . ,2001
776,The causes of the loss of considerable proportion of human embryos withnormal karyotype remains obscure. Kiaris et al. (1996)reported high levelof somatic microsatellite instability in spontaneous abortions 40%revealed discrepancy of PCR alleles between tissue sections from differ ent parts of embryos. To clarify the frequency of somatic microsatellitemutations in spontaneous abortions we have analyzed 55 missed abor tions and anembryonic pregnancies with normal karyotype. DNA wasextracted from fetal membranes or chorionic villi which originated from twodifferent embryo determinants extra embryonic mesoderm and cytotro phoblast. These tissues differentiates during the first several days of onto genesis and such approach allows to reveal mutations which took place atearly stages of embryonic development. We used polyacrylamide gel elec trophoresis following PCR amplification for 21 tetranucleotide high poly morphous loci located on seven autosomes. The isolated STR mismatch es were evaluated in parent/abortus allelic transfers. An undetected twindemise (chimerizm) and non paternity were excluded with high probability(more then 99.9%) by using of the other loci. We found four cases of thirdPosters: Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 219allele appearance. In two cases all three alleles were analogous with par ent s ones what is a result of cytogenetically unrecognized mosaic trisomy. The presence of somatic mutation was detected by appearing in gel analy sis a new (third) allele which can be distinguished from the parents ones. We observed two (3.6%) unambiguous events of somatic microsatellitemutations only that is by order of magnitude smaller than was found byKiaris et al. (1996). A comprehensive analysis is in progress to confirmthese results. ,2001
777,Amniocentesis is the most commonly performed during the midsecondtrimester (16 18 week). We have reported the results of our groups ofpatients who had early amniocentesis (EA) before 16th week of gestation. This paper presents the results of amniocentesis performed between 13 15th week of gestation and its complications. We have also followed theoffspring at birth and again by the first year of life. ,2001
778,In current amniocentesis practice 20 ml amniotic fluid (AF) is drawn forprenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. When as is often the case in a not negli gible proportion of cases only a smaller volume is obtained repeatedamniocentesis is recommended. This prompted us to investigate the mini mal volume of AF required for a reliable cytogenetic diagnosis (14 clones).Based upon the number of clones per Ã¯Â¬\x8235 mm petri dish in which amnio cytes were cultured the first possible day for in situ cytogenetic analyseswas determined for 12 samples taken at 14 16 weeks of gestation. Cul tures were started from a range of small volumes of AF. It appeared thatvolumes smaller than 0.8ml yielded too few clones for a reliable diagnosis. The 12 cultures which started from 0.8 ml AF yielded 14Ã¢\x80\x937 clones at day12. Controls started with approximately 5 ml AF 18 Ã¢\x80\x93 5 clones at day 9. Afurther series of 40 samples yielded 13Ã¢\x80\x936 clones at day 11 for 0.8 ml AFand for controls 16Ã¢\x80\x935 clones at day 9. Thus by using 4 petridishes perdiagnosis repeated amniocentesis will not be necessary as long as morethan 3.2 ml of AF is available. Since the number of clones obtained from0.8 ml AF is comparable to the number obtained in protocols for earlyamniocentesis1 it might be worthwhile to investigate the feasibility to alsoperform early diagnosis with smaller volumes of AF. 1Kennerknecht I Baur Auberle S Grab D and Terinde R (1992) First trimester amniocente sis between the seventh and 13th weeks evaluation of the earliest possi ble genetic diagnosis Prenat Diagn12 595 601 ,2001
779,Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an inci dence of 1 in 5000 live births. Symptoms are variable from skeletal over growth cutaneous striae to ectopia lentis and aortic dilatation leading todissection. Since the disease causing mutations are dispersed throughoutthe fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) prenatal diagnosis was until recently usuallyperformed by linkage analysis in familial cases. However mutation detec tion has become feasible with thorough screening methods. The pheno typic variability of the MFS makes reproductive options difficult as molec ular diagnosis cannot predict clinical severity of the disease. We presentdata on 14 prenatal and/or pre implantation diagnoses (PGD) in eight fam ilies originating from Belgium the Netherlands Spain and France. In fourfamilies prenatal diagnosis was carried out using linkage analysis where as in four other families the causative FBN1 mutation was characterised. Four PGD cycles in two couples lead to one ongoing pregnancy and inaddition two amniocenteses and eight chorion villus samplings were per formed. In four pregnancies an affected foetus was diagnosed. In one ofthem the couple chose to continue the pregnancy and an affected childwas born whereas the 3 other couples decided to terminate the pregnan cy. We expect that the availability of molecular tests will increase requestsfor prenatal diagnosis. PGD represents an acceptable alternative in cou ples facing ethical reproductive dilemmas. ,2001
780,Cytogenetic assessment of high risk pregnancies during the second andthird trimesters has primarily been achieved by amniocentesis despite thereported efficacy and safety of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for secondand third trimester cytogenetic analyses. Indeed the concomitant use offluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to obtain rapid cytogenetic informa tion from amniotic fluid samples is gaining popularity in the United Statesand Europe. However FISH analysis of amniotic fluid cells is frought withdiagnostic limitations and additional expense. We seek to compare the useof five color FISH analysis to CVS for the assessment of late gestation(>14.0 weeks gestation) pregnancies at increased risk for fetal chromo some abnormalities. Materials/Methods Late gestation CVS was per formed on 97 women at increased risk for fetal chromosome abnormalitiesfrom January 1995 through November 2000 seventy nine women for pos itive maternal serum screen outcomes (and nonelevated AFP) and 18 forfetal structural abnormalities (without evidence of neural tube defects).Results Cytogenetic results were obtained from all samples. Five of the 79samples obtained from pregnancies identified by maternal serum screen ing were characterized by chromosome abnormalities (3 cases of trisomy21 and single cases of 45 X and trisomy 18). Nine of the 17 samplesobtained from women carrying fetuses with structural defects were char acterized by karyotypic abnormalities (3 cases of trisomy 18 and singlecases of trisomy 21 trisomy 13 45 X 47 XX +mar partial trisomy 8 andder17). Of the 14 cases of karyotypic abnormalities 3 (21.4%) would nothave been detected by FISH analyses for chromosomes X Y 13 18 and21. In addition FISH analyses added $75 to $240 to the cytogenetic costof each case. Conclusion Late gestation CVS provides the opportunity toobtain rapid and comprehensive cytogenetic information in a time framesimilar to that required for FISH analyses. FISH also adds additional costwhile providing less cytogenetic information than that obtainable by CVS. CVS should thus be considered when a prengnacy at high risk for fetalchromosome abnormalities (without a concomitant increased risk for AFP related abnormalities) is detected after 14 weeks gestation. ,2001
781,As the knowledge on dysmorphic traits distinctive for children with geneticsyndromes is essential in the diagnostic process a support of appropriatephotographic documentation is indispensable. Moreover the clinical traitevaluation may be ensured by certain measurements made on those pho tographs. However data elicited from a normal population are needed forconcluding on the findings of children being diagnosed. They are neededin particular for newborns due to the principal concern of early diagnosing. The aim of our study was to determine the index values of selected anthro pologically defined facial traits in a group of healthy newborns. 85 ran domly selected healthy newborns (51 females and 34 males) aged from 1to 14 days born at term spontaneously or by Caesarean section werestudied. The photoanthropometric analysis was made according to Sten gel Rutkowski. A range between the 3rd and 97th percentiles was delin eated for discrimination of the values considered as dysmorphic. No sig nificant differences related to age sex or delivery passage were found. We suggest that the obtained database may be useful as an approach ofthe normal population for comparing with the respective data elicited fromnewborns with genetic syndromes. ,2001
782,In 1996 we reported the use of dried maternal blood samples for ONTD Down syndrome Trisomy 18 screening (Macri et.al.) We present anexpanded comparison of our second trimester screen positive rates. Driedblood samples provide significant advantages over liquid samples byreducing biohazard and eliminating broken tubes centrifugation and sam ple degradation. The biggest advantage is the smaller standard deviationsof analyte levels observed with dried blood compared to liquid serum. Inboth second trimester and first trimester screening we observed smallerthan previously reported SD. NR = Not reported. *This number based on results after second specimen collected. Cut off Risks ONTD 1/400 Down s 1/ 380 t18 1/500. Recent studies indicate first trimester screening using nuchal translucency free B hCG and PAPP A is effective. We have prospectively evaluatedover 25 000 first trimester patients exclusively with dried blood specimens. In summary the data indicate the screen positive rate in our expandeddried blood screening is similar to the initial report showing significantlydecreased screen positive rates. ,2001
783,In selected patients prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities could beperformed between 7 to 9 weeks of pregnancy via the coelocentesis pro cedure (Jurkovic 1993 Pandya 1995). PCR and FISH based genetic stud ies have been performed in extra celomic fluid (ECF) obtained from womenprior to a termination of pregnancy. However only one author has been able to obtain a conventional karyotype in ECF ( Gruger 1996). Our objec tive was to gain further insight into the previously described technical vari ables that may determine a successful culture on a small ECF sample. Weperformed 7 ultrasound guided coelocentesis (2 4 mL) in 7 time pregnantbaboons at 36 40 days post conception. The initial 0.5mL was discarded. ECF samples were ramdomly assigned to 2 groups in which the only dif ferences were the container and the type of medium. TABLE shows Ani mal# ECF mL Type of Container Type of Medium Culture Days Kary otype results and Pregnancy outcome.

Con tainer (A) Small Petri dish keeping medium+ ECF on the small cover slip (B) Plastic flaskettes which allows the medium+ECF to spread on the larg er cover slip. CONCLUSIONS We confirm that standard cytogenetic stud ies can be done in very small samples of ECF. This preliminary data alsosuggests that it is keeping the cells together what may determine a suc cesful ECF culture. ,2001
784,It is known that the sentinel anomalies (SA) and Down s syndrome (DS)make a considerable contribution into infant morbidity and mortality. Thesedefects are diagnosed well and can provide important clues in the detec tion of teratogenic agents. An anencephalia spina bifida limb reduction oesophageal atresia and traheo oesophageal fistula ano rectal atresia cleft of a labium with / or without cleft of a palate multiple congenitalsanomalies and Down syndrome were taken into account. Objective. To estimate the relative risk (RR) of the live borns with SA andDS in different Ukrainian regions. Methods. Data on live borns only were received from the annual reports ofseven medical genetic centres of Ukraine (Southern Western North Northern Eastern Central South Eastern South Western). Period of theobservation from 1993 to 1999. The precise data about still borns withbirth defects are unknown in Ukraine. RR was calculated according to EpiPosters: Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 221 Macri et al 1996Current Experience Total Screened 7 497 102 487 Initial Positive Rate ONTD 4.4% 3.4% Down syndrome 3.6% 3.4% Trisomy 18 NR 0.6% False Positive Rate afte r revision ONTD* 2.7% 2.0% Down syndrome 2.8% 2.4% Trisomy 18 NR 0.5% Macri et al 1996Current Experience Total Screened 7 497 102 487 Initial Positive Rate ONTD 4.4% 3.4% Down syndrome 3.6% 3.4% Trisomy 18 NR 0.6% False Positive Rate afte r revision ONTD* 2.7% 2.0% Down syndrome 2.8% 2.4% Trisomy 18 NR 0.5%Info program for each selected defects. Results. It was established that RR evenly disseminated among the new borns of the country. RR for sentinel anomalies is demonstrated in theTable. RR was lower in the Northern and the South Eastern regions (0 86at the 0.81 0.90 confidence interval 0.88 CI 0.84 0.93). RR was the high est in the Southern (1.10 CI 1.02 1.19) and the Northern Eastern regions(1.19 CI 1.14 1.25)(Table). Conclusion. The distinctions in the rates of observed defects can reflect not only the difference of incidence in population but mainly the difference inthe levels and the quality of medical care and other socio economic fac tors. ,2001
785,Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most frequent human chromosomal disorder occurring in approximately 1 in 700 newborns. Prenatal diagno sis is offered because of advansed maternal age abnormal maternalserum screening or ultrasound examination suggesting fetal abnormalities. It is usually performed by cytogenetic analysis of fetal cells but this proce dure is long lasting expensive requires high technical experience andexists some risk of culture or cytogenetic analysis failure. Here we reportthe results from our initial experience of introducing a quantitative fluores cent PCR based analysis for rapid determination of trisomy 21 status. Atotal of 38 fetus DNA samples were extracted from amniotic cells chorion ic villi and cultivated fibroblasts all samples were analysed in blind. Fluo rescent labeled primers were used to amplify 2 STRs on chromosome 21and PCR products were analyzed on an automatic DNA sequencer to iden tify the presence of two or three copies of chromosome 21. In this studyD21S11 microsatellite gave an informative results by QF PCR for a groupof 32 samples while marker D21S1270 for another 32 samples. All sam ples were informative for at least one marker 35 fetuses were identified ashaving two copies of chromosome 21 and 3 fetuses as having trisomy21. Our results indicate that QF PCR could be used as an alternative rapidand accurate method for prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome espes sially when ultrasound or biochemical analyses already suggest fetal chro mosome disorders. Rapid results will allow a termination of pregnancy atan early stage of gestation. ,2001
786,Duchenne and Becker Muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) are X linked dis orders affecting 1 3500 and 1 in 18000 live male birth respectively. BothDMD and BMD result from heterogeneous mutations in the dystrophingene and in about 65% of the cases the gene has one or more deletedexons and the remaining cases are revealed as point mutation. One thirdof cases arise from new mutation and two thirds are familial. In order todetermine the range of the deletion in Iranian patients and prenatal diag nosis a deletion screening and linkage analysis were preformed in a groupof 30 unrelated DMD/BMD patients. Three sets of multiplex PCR wereused to screen for twenty of the most frequent deletions of dystrophingene. Three intragenic RFLPs (pERT87 15/Bam HI pERT 87 8/Taq I pERT87 15/XmnI) and Two CA repeats (3 Dys and 5 Dys MSA) whichhave the most hetrozygostiy frequency were used to carrier detection andlinkage analysis. Deletions were detected in 53% of the patients and mostof the deletions were in exons 46(13.5%) 47 50 (11.8% each) and the number of deleted exons varied from one to nine. So far 8 prenatal diag nosis have been performed. ,2001
787,Platelet activating factor (PAF) a phospholipid with a multiple actions thatinclude thrombosis and inflammation is immediately inactivated by a plas ma enzyme PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF AH). Deficiency of this enzyme inplasma is caused by a missense mutation in the gene (Val279Phe). Sur prisingly 4% of the Japanese population lacks the extra cellular isoform ofthis enzyme plasma PAF AH due to this mutation. However the role of adeficiency of this enzyme caused by this mutation in the etiology of severpreeclampsia has not been determined. In this study we investigated apossible association of this mutation with the risk of sever preeclampsia inthe Japanese population. The allele frequency of Val279Phe mutation was18.9% in 111 patients with sever preeclampsia and 21.0% in 188 healthypregnant controls women (P = 0.60). The frequency of the homozygotesfor the 279Phe allele was not significantly different between the patientsand the control pregnant women (P = 0.75). These findings indicate thatplasma PAF AH deficiency due to Val279Phe mutation has no major effecton the etiology of sever preeclampsia in the Japanese population. ,2001
788,Since the cloning of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene a great deal of informa tion has been contributed by various centres worldwide. More then 800mutations together with their distributions and frequencies have beenidentified in various populations. In order to determine the heterogeneity ofmutations in Yugoslavian (YU) CF patients we analyzed 244 CF chromo somes by PAGE DGGE and direct sequencing of PCR amplified genomicDNA. The major mutation deltaF508 accounts for 68 44% of CF chromo somes (167 CF alleles) whereas another 18 mutations account for 13 12%(32 CF alleles). Finally 18 44% of YU CF chromosomes (45 CF alleles)remain uncharacterized. At present we have identified 15 mutations thathave frequency of less then 1%. That indicates the high degree of muta tional heterogeneity in Yugoslavia. In this work authors will discuss theirresults comparing them with datas from other European populations. ,2001
789,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and the milder allelic Becker Mus cular Dystrophy (BMD) are X linked disorders affecting 1 out of 3500 & 1out of 18000 live male birth respectively. Both DMD & BMD result fromheterogeneous mutation in the dystrophin gene and in about 65% of thecases one or more exons of the gene are deleted or duplicated. One thirdof cases arise from new mutations & two third are familial. To analyze theprevalence of deletion in Iranian patients a deletion screening was per formed on a group of 88 unrelated DMD/BMD patients. Three set of multi plex PCRs were used to screen 18 exons of dystrophin gene. Deletionswere detected in 56.8% of patients. Seventy four percent of deleted exonswere located in the major hot spot region whereas 26% were in the minorhot spot region. The most frequently deleted exons were exons 50 48 &47 (16.2% 16.2% & 12% respectively). No deletion was detected in exon43).

790,All three types of autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy map tochromosome 5q12 and are associated with deletions or mutations of theSMNt gene. The availability of a test to distinguish between the SMNt geneand its nearly identical centromeric copy SMNc allows molecular diagno sis. We have analysed patients from 25 Iranian families for the presenceor absence of a deletion in the SMNt gene. To compare the telomeric withcentromeric portion we have enployed method by ( Chang et al ). Ourresults show that in 23 family (92%)of SMA patients exon 7 of SMNt hasbeen deleted and in about 1 family (4%) of SMA patients exon 8 of SMNthas been deleted. For the remained patients the probability of mutations inSMNt gene exists. Prenatal diagnosis for 6 family was done and 2 affect ed 4 carrier 4 carrier and 2 normal were identified. ,2001
791,To initiate the complete charcterization of mutations in the dystrophin genein Yugoslav Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy patients we screened140 patients for the presence of deletions in the dystrophin gene usingmultiplex PCR reaction for the simultaneous amplification of 17 deletion prone exons and muscular promoter. Intragenic deletions were found in 75of 121 patient with DMD (62%) and in 7 of 19 patients with BMD (36 8%).The majority of deletions were clustered in the 3 region of the gene(76 8%) while deletions in the 5 region were less abundant (18 3%). Lossof muscular promoter region was found in one patient and large dele tions(more than 25 exons) were detected in 3 probands. This results willbe further discussed and compared with the results from other populations. ,2001
792,Ten years of widespread testing for beta thalassemia mutations in Iranusing amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and ReverseHybridization focused on 25 beta thalassemia mutations which havebeen assigned to cover the majority of mutations in the Iranian population. However depending on the geographical location beta thalassemia muta tions of 15% to 30% of the patients remained unidentified indicating thepresence of additional beta globin mutations in Iran. The aim of this studywas the characterization of the molecular defect in a group of patients withunknown mutations. Over a 3 years period a total of 70 DNA samples fromunidentified beta thalassemia cases representing different geographicalareas and ethnical groups were collected from various prenatal diagnosislaboratories in Iran. DNA was subjected to sequence analysis and so farsequencing of 30 of these samples has been performed. Sequence analy sis has reveald 2 new mutations not previously reported. These include amutation in cd 67 T G leading to a hemoglobin variant with a Val Gly sub stitution and a possible beta thalassemia mutation (T C substitution atIVS2.840). Furthermore 8 known mutations (cd 42/43 +T cd 24/25 GGTdel cd 82/83 G del 88 C A 87 C G cd 15 T cd 39 +G and IVS 1/130G C) were identified which can be added to the list of rare b thalassemiamutations in Iran. These results further characterize the heterogenous spectrum of b thalassemia mutations in Iran and will improve the abilitiesin prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection for b thalassemia in order to prevent this prevalent disease in this country. ,2001
793,In Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) experiments the hybridisationefficiency is generally less than satisfactory when total yeast genomic DNAisolated from pulsed field gels is used as probes. to overcome these prob lems Alu PCR products of a chromosome 21 specific YAC 831B9 wasused to detectd the number of chromosome 21 copies on uncultured lym phocytes and amniocytes by FISH. In all of the experiments carried outusing the 831B9 YAC clone strong signals were produced. signal intensi ties were comparable to those observed using chromosome specificalphoid DNA probes. Ninety percent or more of the randomly elevatednuclei from uncultured blood cells and 86% or more of the unculturedamniocytes showed two distinct signals levels which compare favourablywith similar studies in this field. Our results obtained from application of thetechnique on 1000 peipheral blood samples and more than 550 amnioticfluid samples suggests that this approach can be reliably used for prena tal and postnatal detection of chromosome 21 aneuploidy. ,2001
794,FragileX syndrome is considered as the most common form of inheritedmental retardation that is dominantly inherited in males as an x linkeddominant trait. This syndrome is known to be the result of a dynamic muta tion at the 5 UTR (Untranslated Region) of the FMR1(FragileX MentalRetardation 1) gene. The number of CGG repeats in this area is amplifiedto more than 200 repeats resulting methylation of CpG islands anddecrease or absent of FMR1 expression in affected individuals. The resultof this methylation is the absense of FMRP (FragileX Mental RetardationProtein) that plays an important role in development of brain neurons. Theclinical phenotypes in males consist of mental retardation special somaticfeatures and macroorchidism. For the first time in Iran we used PCR (Poly merase Chain Reaction) and southern blot analysis for detection of thefragileX mutation. DIG labeled probes were used for the detection of bandsin the southern blot analysis(No radioactive materials were used in thisstudy). 180 individuals from 127 families with at least one mentally retard ed child were examined 79 cases had a full mutation(FM) 10 with a pre mutation(PM) and 91 were normal(N). In prenetal diagnosis that was per formed for 8 fetuses from these families 2 normal males 1 normal females 3 fullmutation males and 2 fullmutation females were detected ,2001
795,ÃÂ§ Thalassemia is the most frequent single gene defect in the world (1).Nearly 25000 indivdual with b Thalassemia major living in Iran. Over 150mutations have been reported sofar. Mutation detection in b globin gene: The mutation spectrum of ÃÂ§ Tha lassemia in Iran is very heterogenously because of different ecological ethnical and geographical feature of the population therfore the mutationanalysis was carried out in five main provinces north south west eastand central. During the last nine years 720 individuals with b Thalassemia have beendiagnosed in the Genetic Clinic in Tehran. 85 % of the patients have been screened for 21 common ÃÂ§ globin genemutations in Iran by directed PCR ARMS methods (2 3) and 12 % ofPosters: Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 223other patients by nine RFLP systems (4). For 3 % of the patients it was not possible to determine the mutations of both alleles.43.3 % of the total marriages have been first or second cousin out ofthese consanguineous marriages 74.35% had the same mutations. Prenatal diagnosis: Out of 305 CVS and amniotic fluid from 610 patients(84.7%) used for prenatal diagnosis (5) 26.1 % were normal for ÃÂ§ globingene 48 9 % trait (Heterozygote) and 25 % major ÃÂ§ Thalassemia. A comparision between frequency of ÃÂ§ globin gene mutations: Resultshave shown that IVSII 1 mutation is the most frequent type in Iran (49%) 52.6 % of which is distributed in northern provinces specially on the Caspi an Sea (4) as the first most frequent mutation in ÃÂ§ globin gene. The low est in centeral provinces (14.0 %) and again higher in the southernprovinces (28 %).IVSI 1 and C39 are most frequent mutations in southern provinces spe cially on the persian golf region. Other frequent mutation in Iran are as follows IVSI 5 (9 %) Fr 8 9 (6 %) C30 (5 %) IVSI 25 (5 %) IVSI 1 10 (5 %). C44(4 %) IVSI 1(4 %) C39 (4 %) IVSI 745 (3%) FR 36 37 (3 %) C8 (2 %) IVSI 6 (1 %) Fr41 42 Fr16 88 C15 IVSI 130 (1 %). b Thalassemia gene flow: The mutation spectrum of the b Thalassemia inIran should be compared with the mutations of the neighbouring countries. Therefore it was necessary to study in a north south west east ÃÂ§ globingene flow in Iran. It shows the following results The frequencis of IVSII 1 is decreased from north to south while the fre quencies of Fr 36 37 C39 and IVSI 1 Show an opposite direction. The frequency of C44 and C30 decreased from west to east and the fre quency of the IVSI 1 increase from west to east. IVSI 1 as a splice junction mutation (C >T) is a prevalent mutation ofAsian Indian and Chinese (South east countries) (7).The frequency of the Fr 36 37 from the west to east of Iran is the same. ,2001
796,Haemophilia A is an X linked recessive genetic disorder affecting 1/5 000 10 000 males resulting from mutations in factor VIII gene. Mutational het erogeneity causes difficulties in identification of mutations. Carrier analysisand prenatal diagnosis is possible by DNA linkage analysis using intra genic factor VIII gene linked DNA markers. In order to find out informative ness of STR markers (intron 13 and 22) in Indian population DNA samplesfrom 50 normal females were amplified by PCR followed by separation indenaturing sequencing gel. Allele sizing was carried out by comparing thebands with pUC sequencing ladder in the same gel. Heterozygosity ofRFLP marker was studied in 60 normal females each for Hind III and Bcl Iby PCR followed by restrction digestion analysis. Observed heterozygosi ty for intron 13 STR was 60% (29/50) and for intron 22 STR was 40%(21/50) respectively. Number of alleles seen for intron 13 and 22 were 5and 4 respectively. Observed heterozygosity for RFLP markers for Hind IIIand Bcl I were 63% (38/60) and 60% (36/60) respectively. Both STR andRFLP markers were used in carrier analysis for 35 haemophilia A familiesand 3 prenatal diagnosis were performed. In order to cover 100 percentfamilies direct detection of intron 22 inversion mutation is under progress. ,2001
797,Neonatal stroke (NS) accounts for about 25% of all childhood stroke andis an incompletely ascertained cause of childhood death mental retarda tion seizures and cerebral palsy. Factor V Leiden (FVL) and other throm bophilic factors in the child have been implicated in causation but maternalfactors have not been systematically evaluated. Between 1998 2000 weevaluated 32 patients with NS looking at thrombophilic factors in the moth er and child as well as multiple clinical characteristics. Patients were ascer tained in clinical settings and ranged in age from newborns to 10 years. NSwas defined on the basis of history and cranial imaging CT(20) MRI(3) both(8) and autopsy(1). Global ischemic injury and watershed infarctswere excluded. Mutations studied included FVL Prothrombin 20210(PRO) methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 (MTHFR) and in mostcases Protein C S and Antithrombin III activities anticardiolipin antibod ies (ACA) and lupus anticoagulant(LAC). Testing was performed on 27mother/child pairs 4 child only and one mother only. Overall 17/32 (53%) of NS were found to have one or more abnormalities in mother child orboth with a total of 25 abnormalities detected. In 6/31 children (19%) wefound 2 with FVL heterozygosity(H) 2 with MTHFR homozygosity(HZ) 3with PRO(H) and one with ACA. In 13/28 mothers (46%) we found 3 withFVL(H) 4 with MTHFR(HZ) one with PRO(H) 6 with ACL one with LACand 2 with confirmed type III Protein S deficiency. Four mothers and onechild had combination defects. Only one mother/child pair were concordantfor the same defect. Our data suggest that maternal thrombophilia may beat least as important as these defects in the fetus. Mechanisms to explainthe apparent role of maternal thrombophilia may include chronic fetalhypoxemia from placental dysfunction for which we have some anecdotalevidence functional breakdown of the placental barrier via thrombosis andinfarction and other undoubtably complex maternal fetal interactions. Acomplete evaluation for thrombophilia in both child and mother is indicatedin NS. Identification of maternal factors is critically important for implemen tation of prevention strategies. Additional studies including the availabilityof population based controls and placental evaluations are needed to con firm and better understand our observations. ,2001
798,Purpose To further characterize the prenatal findings in Beckwith Wiede mann Syndrome (BWS). Methods Two patients had prenatal ultrasonicanomalies suggestive for BWS. Cytogenetic analysis and PCR amplifica tion of polymorphic loci mapping to 11p15.5 region were used. Results Ini tial amniotic karyotype was normal in both. Postnatal evaluation revealedpartial trisomy of 11p15.5 due to paternal translocation in one and paternaluniparental disomy (UPD) in the second patient. Conclusions Thedescribed ultrasonic findings should suggest the syndrome. Prenatal PCRanalysis for 11p15.5 region in addition to conventional cytogenetic analy sis is suggested to detect potential paternal UPD or allelic duplication. ,2001
799,We suggested that p53 is a good candidate gene to be associated withspontaneous abortions due to the fact that p53 inactivation could lead toaccumulation of genome imbalances and miscarriages. For the first timemutation screening of exons 4 to 9 of p53 gene was carried out in 31 spon taneous and 30 voluntary abortions. SSCP shift was detected in exons 6and 9 only in the spontaneous abortions analyzed (23.3%). The DNAsequencing in 1 out of the 7 samples with changed SSCP mobility revealedmisscence mutation GAC to GGC in codon 260 leading to Asp >Gln sub stitution near to the so could hot spot region (third domain) caracterizedby high mutability rate. In two patients the sequencing of exon 6 revealedneutral polymorphism g13399 A>G in two polymorphism in intron 9IVS9nt+12T>C and in two normal sequence. Our results of the p53mutation screening are the first data supporting the hypothesis of possiblerole of p53 mutation in spontaneous abortions in human. ,2001
800, saude.ptWe report the results of a study using fluorescent polymerase chain reac tion (F PCR) of polymorphic tandem repeat markers for rapid foetal sex ing detection of common aneuploidies and determination of zygosity in atotal of 203 pregnancies. Indications included X linked disorders anom alies detected by ultrasound scanning advanced maternal age combinedwith other risk factors and twinning. Testing was carried out directly on 1.5ml amniotic fluid (n=199). Three analyses were done on chorionic villi andone on a failed amniocyte culture. Whenever possible samples from bothparents were collected on filter paper. A previously described combinationof markers for chromosomes 21 13 18 and X was used in addition to oth ers for chromosomes 18 21 Y and the X linked dystrophin gene. Duringthe initial pilot study cultured amniocytes from 10 Down syndrome caseswere used as controls. Nineteen foetuses were correctly diagnosed withaneuploidies involving chromosomes 21 (n=12) 13 (n=2) 18 (n=2) and X(n=3). Markers were uninformative in 4 positive cases (as confirmed bycytogenetic analysis). Five in a total of 16 sets of twins were monozygot ic. A case of Down syndrome was detected in one twin of a dizygotic preg nancy. In the total of samples studied 98% were informative thus allowingthe exclusion of common aneuploidies in 175 foetuses within 24 48 hours. This test also allowed rapid foetal sexing whenever necessary and rapiddetermination of zygosity which is advantageous essentially in like sextwins with uncertain chorionicity.

Najmabadi2 1Karimi Nejad Pathology and Genetic center Tehran Islamic Republic of Iran 2GeneticsResearch Center Welfare Sciences and Rehabilitation Uni versity Tehran Islamic Republic of Iransahebjam@MAILANDNEWS. COMBeta thalassemia is the most common genetic disorder in Iran. It is esti mated that at least 25 000 affected patients and 2 million carriers live inIran. Therefore prenatal diagnosis is at present a primary goal for preven tion. As a first center 10 years ago we started mutation screening and pre natal diagnosis of ÃÂ§ thalassemia in Iranian families. During 10 year periodwe have made prenatal diagnosis for 314 cases (178 amnion samples and136 CVS samples). We used a 23 primers based panel for diagnosing themutations of the parents and samples. Using this panel along with RFLFwe were able to provide a reliable prenatal diagnosis for over 95% of preg nancies. Out of these 314 cases 81 (26%) cases were normal 147 (47%)cases were heterozygotes for a single Beta thalassemia mutation and 72(24%) cases were either homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. In 9samples we could not detect the mutations. Our data showed a very closeMendelian distribution as expected for a Mendelian type mode of inheri tance. The frequency of detected mutations also will be discussed. ,2001
801,Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) is a common autosomal dominant disor der characterized by multiple neurofibromas caf au lait spots and Lischnodules of iris. NF1 gene is located at chromosome 17q11.2 and encodesan mRNA containing 60 exons. The NF1 gene product neurofibromin is alarge protein of 2818 amino acids. The protein acts as a negative regula tor in the ras signal transduction pathway. Diagnosis of NF1 is based onestablished clinical criteria. The disease has a high mutation rate and widerange of expression most patients are expected to have different muta tions so molecular analysis and genetic counselling is limited to the iden tification of the specific mutation in each patient or family. This situtationmeans that genetic counselling has to rely mainly on indirect diagnosisusing linked markers. We have analysed 10 Turkish families for a total of27 affected individuals and 34 non affected relatives with the use of poly morphic sequences 4 intragenic and 5 flanking markers. We have starteddiagnosis by using extragenic RFLPs ( pHHH 202 p11.3C4.2 pEW206 pEW207 p2F9.8 ). Then the use of intragenic microsatellit markers (EVI20 CA repeat Alu AAAT repeat IVS38GT53.0 CA/GT repeat IVS27AC28.4 AC/TG repeat ) has increased the informativity in our seriesof NF1 families. As a result we can provide the prenatal and the presym tomatic diagnosis to these families. ,2001
802,This poster will describe the experience of 6 countries participating in amultidisciplinary study of prenatal tests in pregnancies at risk of Hunting ton s disease. Additional data will also be presented from 7 centres withinthe 6 countries. A total of 305 tests were performed. The average age ofthe prospective parent at risk of Huntington s disease (HD) was 30.8 years and 53.9% of this group were female. 57.4% of the prospective parentswere known to have the gene for HD whereas the others had not under gone predictive or diagnostic testing. 65.2% of the pregnancies wereinvestigated using mutation analysis the remainder by exclusion testing. Exclusion testing allows the at risk prospective parent to have children atnegligible risk of HD without defining accurately their own risk as it showswhether the fetus has inherited the at risk chromosome 4 from the affect ed grandparent. If so then the fetus shares the 50% risk of the prospec tive parent if not then the fetus is at negligible risk. 43% of the total testsgave an unfavourable result. 8 of these high risk pregnancies were contin ued. Data from the 7 participating centres will be given which describe inmore detail 202 of the 305 tests. These data also describe 114 pregnan cies in 41 couples who had 2 or more prenatal tests (range 2 5 tests).Although prenatal testing is used by the minority of those at risk of HD itis clear from this study that both direct testing for the HD mutation andexclusion testing are valuable tools in preventing transmission of HD forindividuals who belong to an HD family. ,2001
803, u.ac.jpWe investigated whether the amount of circulating cell free fetal DNA inmaternal serum is influenced by fetal karyotype using real time quantita tive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Serum samples wereobtained from pregnant women at week 15 to 17 of gestation prior toundergoing amniocentesis. We examined 70 samples in total consisting of55 pregnant women with 46 XY 5 cases with 47 XY +21 3 cases with47 XY +18 a single case with 46 XY dup(1) and 2 cases with twins of46 XY and 4 cases with 46 XX which were used as negative controls. Wemeasured the concentration of the SRY sequence as a molecular markerfor fetal DNA. The SRY sequence was detectable and measurable whenthe fetuses were male except for one case with 47 XY +18. This caseshowed fetal growth retardation and bradycardia. No amplification signalsof the SRY sequence were detected when the fetuses were female. Themean concentration of fetal DNA in maternal serum was 31.5 copies/ml inthe pregnancies with 46 XY 23.5 copies/ml in the pregnancies with47 XY +21 and 21.5 copies/ml in the pregnancies with 46 XY +18. No sig nificant difference in the concentration of fetal DNA was observed+between pregnancies with fetuses of normal karyotype and those withfetuses of abnormal karyotype. ,2001
804,Our group has previously shown that fetal erythroblasts can be enrichedfor from maternal blood using magnetic cell separation (MACS) by whichmeans we were able to identify fetal aneuploidies before an invasive pro cedure. This aspect is currently being investigated in the large scale NIHfunded NIFTY study in which our group is participating. We have recentlyextended upon these early observations by examining the possibility ofdetermining fetal genetic loci by single cell PCR in individual erythroblastsisolated by micromanipulation. This study which for convenience focusedon the fetal rhesus D and SRY loci indicated that it is possible to determinemultiple fetal loci with a high degree of accuracy by these means. This226 Posters: Prenatal and Perinatal Geneticsaspect has been confimred in a further collaborative study in which we examined for fetal hemoglobinopathies. We have also intensely pursuedthe recent finding of free fetal DNA in maternal plasma. By using the samesensitive PCR assay that we have established for the analysis of singlefetal cells we have shown that multiple fetal loci can be reliably determinedusing free fetal DNA. In order to optimise this assay for a possible clinicalsetting we have recently developed a multiplex realtime PCR assay asthis methodology is more amenable to automation. By the use of such real time quantitative PCR assays we have also made the interesting findingthat free fetal DNA levels are elevated in pregnancies with trisomy 21fetuses but not in those with trisomy 18 fetuses. This result which con firms and extends upon a report made by Lo and Bianchi could form thebasis of a new additional screening assay for the detection of fetal aneu ploidies. ,2001
805,Low HCG in the triple test is ussually associated with low uE3 and togeth er indicate higher risk for Edwards or Patau syndrome triploidy or preg nancy with Turner syndrome without hydrops. hCG can be also lowered insome cases of Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome ( estriol is low more often) andin pregnancy with bad course (i.e. missed abortion). We present five casesof low hCG associated with chromosomal abnormalities. In the fist therewas low hCG (0 35 MoM) and high AFP (2 41 MoM) in the karyotype was5 45 %mosaicism for trisomy 8. In the second case hCG was 0 31 MoM uE3 0 42 MoM risk for M. Edwards 1 19 karyotype 46 XY. Immediatelyafter birth critical defect led to the defect of this newborn baby FISH analy sis confirmed 22 q 11.2 microdeletion. In the third case hCG was 0 35MoM there was evaluated duodenal obstruction by US investigation in the32nd week of pregnancy karyotype was 47 XXY. In the forth case hCGwas 0 23 MoM karyotype was 47 XYY. In the last case hCG was 0 23MoM echokardiogram showed cardiac failure fetal ultrasound investiga tion described ren arcuatum karyotype was 46 XX. By the method QFPCRwe proved partial trisomy of the 18 th chromosome TOP was provided. Conclusions We recommend better control of pregnancies with low hCG detailed ultrasound and echocardiography investigation of the fetus kary otyping of amniocentesis eventually. There is about 8% pregnant womanwith hCG bellow 0 5 MoM therefore we stress the necessity of each eval uation individiually. ,2001
806,Objectives To examine the assumption that AFAFP levels are different infemale and male fetuses. To look for a possible difference in the levels ofAFAFP between monozygous and heterozygous twins. Since the produc tion of AFAFP is similar in monozygous twins the levels of AFAFP shouldreflect these changes as well. Design Comparison of the levels of AFAFPbetween pregnancies with female and male fetuses in gender concordantand gender disconcordant twin. In addition AF levels of AFP in monozy gotic and heterozygotic twins were compared. A t test of P< 0.05 was con sidered significant. Material and Methods Between 1995 1999 we per formed 201 amniocenteses on twin pregnancies at Meir Hospital KfarSaba Israel. One hundred and nine of them were concordant for gender(62 females and 47 males) while 92 had a different sex. Amniotic fluid AFPlevels of each sac were measured using fluorescent immunoassay meth ods. Results There was no significant difference in the levels of AFAFP infemale compared to male twins. Average AFAFP was lower in female twinscompared to their male counterpart (p=0.07). Nevertheless there was nodifference between AFAFP of male versus female fetuses in gender dis cordant fetuses. AFAFP did not differ significantly in cases of identical twinfrom non identical or unknown zygosity twins Conclusions We could notdetect a significant difference between AFAFP levels in monozygous ver sus heterozygous twin. However the levels of AFAFP were higher in maletwins concordant for gender in comparison to female. No such difference was found between female versus male fetuses of disconcordant twins forgender. ,2001
807,Recently a new screening method for Down s syndrome based on the inte gration of sequential measurements of first and second trimester markersinto a single test was described. This integrated test is supposed to detectmore cases of trisomy 21 with a lower false positive rate than currentlyavailable first trimester combined test (nuchal translucency free beta hCG PAPP A) and (hCG unconjugated estriol alpha fetoprotein). The esti mates of its performance are based on there being little or no correlationbetween the first and second trimester markers used. We verified thisassumption in an unselected pregnant population. We studied 927 con secutive singleton. All the women had both first trimester combined testand second trimester triple test. All the maternal serum marker levels wereassayed by immunoradiometric measurements. Nuchal translucency (NT)and biochemical marker measurements were transformed as gestation specific multiples of the median (MoM). The correlation between each pairof markers was analysed by Pearson s r regression coefficient. No markershowed a significant correlation with any other one with the exception offree beta hCG subunit versus total hCG (* p<0.001). Thus the informa tions supplied by first and second trimester screening markers are differ ent with the obvious exception of free beta hCG and total hCG. Then it iscorrect to integrate first and second trimester markers levels. ,2001
808,A case of aplasia cutis congenita with elevated maternal serum and amni otic fluid alphafetoprotein and a positive acetylcholinesterase is described. The patient was 29 year old Asian woman gravida 3 para 2. The mater nal serum drawn at 18 weeks revealed a high level of alphafetopro tein 392ng/ml(8.4 multiples of the median). Amniotic fluid alphafetoproteinwas also elevated at 49.6ug/ml(8.2 multiples of the median). Acetyl cholinesterase was positive and amniotic fluid culture revealed a normal46 XX karyotype. At 28 weeks the patient presented with ruptured mem branes chorioamnionitis. Following cesarean delivery the neonate wasfound to have lacked >85% of its skin and died. Autopsy revealed aplasiacutis congenita involving >85% of the body with absent scalp hair and eye lashes. The other noted dysmorphic features were a flat facial profile adown turned mouth an abnormally curled right ear and the left ear fusedto the scalp. The plausible theories for the pathogenesis were discussed. Furthermore it was discussed whether the acetylcholinesterase to pseudocholinesterase ratio is diagnostic tool in differentiating neural tubedefects from other anomalies. It was advocated that aplasia cutis congeni ta must be considered in the differential diagnosis in a pregnancy evi denced with elevated levels of serum and amniotic fluid alphafetoprotein positive acetylcholinesterase and normal ultrasonography outcome. ,2001

810,Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is associated with Down syndrome(DS) and is therefore used in most second trimester maternal serum DSscreening programs. Elevated hCG is also known to be associated withadverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia miscarriage and fetalgrowth restriction (FGR). This has been attributed to placental abnormali ties. Recently first trimester DS screening has been introduced usingnuchal translucency (NT) and maternal serum biochemical markers (freebeta hCG and PAPP A). The purpose of this study was to evaluatewhether first trimester maternal serum free beta hCG is also associatedwith adverse outcomes. The study included 1269 patients with singletonpregnancies who underwent first trimester DS screening. The rates of var ious pregnancy outcomes were evaluated according maternal serum freebeta hCG levels. A cut off value of 3.0 multiples of the median (MoM) wasemployed. 92 patients (7%) had elevated free beta hCG however no sig nificant increase was found in these patients for any of the outcomes eval uated No other statistically significant cut off values for free beta hCG were detected. We conclude that unlike second trimester beta hCG firsttrimester free beta hCG is not a predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes. ,2001
811,In order to evaluate serum PAPP A as a risk marker for fetal trisomiesPAPP A concentrations were assayed in 33 serum samples of pregnanciesaffected by fetal trisomy 18 (13 cases) and trisomy 21 (20 cases) and in593 controls between 9th and 13th week of gestation. The median PAPP A MoM values were 0.22 MoM for trisomy 18 and 0.38 MoM for trisomy 21 thus significantly lower than the median of the controls (1 MoM). A riskalgorithm was modelled on the basis of the found PAPP A distributions andadditionally on hCG and AFP distributions of 98 pregnancies affected byfetal trisomy 21 and those of 588 matched controls of the second trimester. Compared with the Triple test the new algorithm results both in a highersensitivity and in a higher specificity as to risk assessment for trisomy 21.Subsequently 644 prospective examinations were carried out by combin ing the serum markers PAPP A (first trimester) and hCG/AFP (secondtrimester) and by applying the new risk algorithm. In this cohort two caseswith fetal trisomy 21 were detected because of high risk (>1 380) and onecase with fetal trisomy 18 was found solely by an extremely low PAPP Aconcentration (0 2 MoM). The false positive rate was 5 5% and there wereno false negative results. ,2001
812,Aim to examine the predictive value of maternal serum Placental GrowthHormone (hPGH) in prenatal diagnosis of fetuses affected by congenitalanomalies. Material Methods Serum samples were obtained at 16th 17thweek from 122 high risk pregnancies of an abnormal fetus. The increasedrisk was identified by advanced maternal age (#48) pathological biochem ical markers (#31) ultrasound scanning (USS) (#19) positive family histo ry (#10) increased nuchal translucency (#9) and diabetes mellitus (#5).Amniocentesis was performed in 76 pregnancies and high quality USS at20th 22nd week in the remaining 46 cases. Maternal serum hPGH wasmeasured by a solid phase immunoradiometric assay using specific mon oclonal antibodies for two different epitopes of hPGH. T test and Post Hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Results Karyotype analysisrevealed 7 fetuses with chromosomal aberration and USS detected 19fetuses with minor or major malformation. The mean value of hPGH serumconcentration of the 26 pathological fetuses was 6.28 ng/ml (SD Ã¢\x80\x934.32)that was significantly higher than the mean value (2.79 ng/ml Ã¢\x80\x931.68 SD) innormal fetuses (p<0 05). The hPGH determination in the detection ofabnormal fetuses had 42% sensitivity 75% specificity 41% positive and80% negative predictive value. Conclusion our results show that hPGH is228 Posters: Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics Adverse Pregnancy OutcomeFree beta hCG >= 3.0 MOM (n=92)Free beta hCG < 3.0 MOM (n=1177) FGR 2.2 % 2.3 % Oligohydramnios 1.1 % 0.2 % Preeclampsia 2.2 % 2.8 % Preterm delivery 3.3 % 3.3 % Miscarriage 0 % 0.8 % Chromosome aberration1.1 % 1.5 % Fetal anomaly 1.1 % 1.3 % Abruptio placentae 0 % 0.1 %a specific marker for prenatal detection of fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities and congenital malformations.

813,Most studies regarding the risk for Trisomy 18 when a choroid plexus cyst(CPC) is found on prenatal ultrasound employ an average risk of approxi mately 1/150. The major difficulty in interpreting most of the previous stud ies has been the failure to consider other variables that impact the risk ofaneuploidy such as maternal age or serum screening results. Gupta et al.(1997) analyzed prospective studies of unselected populations and sug gested a relative risk of 9 when the CPC is isolated and a relative risk of1800 when the CPC is associated with other ultrasound abnormalities. Wepresent a study of more than 300 CPCs detected in the 2nd trimester afterthe advent of triple marker screening. The results are presented using boththe average risk method most commonly employed in the clinical literature as well as using the likelihood ratios suggested by Gupta et al. to modifyindividual risk assessment. Two hundred eighty patients had isolatedCPCs and 43 patients had complicated CPCs. Of the 43 complicatedCPCs there were 9 karyotypic abnormalities (8 trisomy 18 and one inher ited chromosome 9 inversion). Of the 280 isolated CPCs there were 3karyotypic abnormalities (one trisomy 18 one 45 X/46 X iso(Xq) and onede novo chromosome 16 inversion). The incidence of finding a significantchromosomal anomaly in fetuses with isolated CPCs is thus 1/93 in ourreferral population if an average risk method is employed. If trisomy 18 riskhad been modified according to the likelihood ratios established by Guptaet al. 97 women would have had a midtrimester risk greater than or equalto 1/100 and would have been offered amniocentesis. This level of risk(1/100) was chosen because it is at this risk for trisomy 18 that amniocen tesis is funded by the state prenatal diagnosis program. All 9 cases of tri somy 18 would have been ascertained using this method as well as thede novo chromosome 16 inversion and the familial chromosome 9 inver sion. The only chromosomal abnormality that would not have been ascer tained is the case with 45 X/46 X iso(Xq). However because of her age this patient was eligible for amniocentesis irrespective of the trisomy 18risk. With individualized risk assessment that included triple markerscreening results 65 amniocenteses would have been performed insteadof 218 that were performed using the average risk method of counseling. There would have been no reduction in sensitivity for trisomy 18 andspecificity would have increased greatly. In addition to fiscal savings thetheoretical loss of one fetus due to a procedure related loss would havebeen avoided. We conclude that the individualized risk assessment usingthe method advocating by Gupta et al. is preferable to an average risk incounseling patients with CPC about the risk for Trisomy 18. ,2001
814,First trimester risk screening was introduced in late 1997 using the sono graphic measurement of the fetal nuchal translucency (NT) and participat ing in the quality control scheme of the Fetal Medicine Foundation Lon don. Later maternal serum markers (free ÃÂ§ hCG PAPP A) were included. Patients were ascertained at the University W omen s Hospital Basel from the outpatient clinic and those refered for specialized ultrasound services. Risk screening was offered to all patients with a fetal crown rump lengthbetween 38 and 84 mm (i.e. gestational age 10+3 to 13+6 weeks) afterextensive counseling. A total of 2339 consecutive pregnancies will havereached term by the end of April 2001 following risk screening. So far atotal of 38 unbalanced chromosomal anomalies (including 13 trisomies 21 11 trisomies 18 7 Turner syndromes) were diagnosed mainly by CVS oramniocentesis. A preliminary analysis based on NT measurements aloneand a risk cut off of 1 400 revealed a detection rate of 36 out of 38 unbal anced chromosome anomalies (95 %) with a false positive rate of 10 %.Risk screening in the first trimester appears to have clear advantages ascompared to second trimester screening using maternal serum markers. ,2001
815,Objective To investigate the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 syndromeusing chromosome 13/21?satellite probe Fluorecence in situ hybridizationPosters: Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 229(FISH) on uncultured interphase cells from amnic fluid. Methods The interphase amniocytes of 10 fetus who were detected normaland 3 fetus who were detected trisomy by prenatal cytogenetic diagnosiswere selected. We did FISH which used chromosome 13/21 ? satelliteprobe directly on the uncultured amniocytes of these 13 samples. Results The total rate of the hybridization were 36.7% and 38.6% in con trols group and observation group respectively which showed no signifi cantly difference. In controls group there are 36.5% of the cells which havefour signals in the nucleus and 4.0% of the cells which have five signals inthe nucleus. In observation group there are 3.9% of the cells which havefour signals in the nucleus and 36.1% of the cells which have five signalsin the nucleus. The controls group and observation group showed signifi cant difference by the statistical X 2values (P<0.01). Trisomy 21 syndrome was diagnosed when cells which have five signals in nucleus were morethan 36.1%. Conclusion Chromosome 13/21? satellite probe is a very reliable and valu able method for the prenatal diagnosis on trisomy 21 syndrome. ,2001
816,We present 27 cases of prenatal marker chromosomes (mar) identifiedafter amniocentesis chorionic villus sampling or cordocentesis. Investiga tions included conventional cytogenetics (GTG CBG NOR banding) andFISH using locus and centromere specific probes and whole chromosomepaints. Eleven mar were present in mosaic status with normal cells and 16were present in all cells. Twenty mar were found to have arisen de novoand 7 were found to be familial (3 mat 4 pat). Markers originated fromchromosomes 1 8 11 22 12 13 or 21 (4x) 15 (5x) 15 21 or 13 15 16 18 (2x) 19 21 and 22 (8x). Outcomes One woman had an abortion. Seven pregnancies were terminated 6 of them after abnormal ultrasoundfindings indicated a high risk for a handicapped child. One woman with amoderately increased risk for a handicapped child chose to terminate thepregnancy without ultrasonografic abnormalities after being counselled . Atotal of 19 children were born of which seventeen are healthy (range 0 5years 6 females and 11 males) One male twin karyotype47 XY +mar(11 22) with severe malformations (enterothorax diaphrag matic hernia hydrocephalus atrioventricular septal defect renal malfor mations) died one hour after birth the other twin is healthy (balanced11 22 translocation). One other male child demonstrates congenital abnor malities (cat eye syndrome preauricular pit renal dysfunction and moder ate growth and motor retardation). A subset of the healthy children hadhigh risk marker chromosomes. Aspects of genetic counselling will be dis cussed. ,2001
817,The incidence of microdeletion 22q11 in fetal populations is not known butis probably lower than in liveborns given the greater role that aneuploidyplays in fetuses. All cardiac anomalies diagnosed in the Fetal PathologyLaboratory at C&W Hospital in a 2 year period were collected. Method ofascertainment presence of other anomalies cytogenetic results andresults of del22q11 FISH testing were noted. Chromosomally normal casesin which del22q11FISH testing had not been performed were tested mole cularly. Cardiac anomalies were present in 102 of 484 fetal autopsies. 32cases were terminated after prenatal diagnosis of chromosome abnormal ity 17 were spontaneously aborted and the rest were terminated after pre natal diagnosis of fetal anomalies including 14 cases diagnosed with car diac anomaly. Most (90/102) cases had other anomalies ( complex ) only12 had isolated cardiac lesions. 5 of the isolated cases and 64 of the com plex group were chromosomally abnormal. Excluding those 32 cases ter minated on the basis of chromosome abnormality (4 isolated 28 complex) 1/8 (12.5%) isolated cardiac lesions and 37/62 (59.7%)complex caseswere abnormal. The most common abnormality was VSD. Tetralogy of Fal lot was present in 7 cases and there were 2 cases of truncus arteriosusand 3 of pulmonary atresia. Eight chromosomally normal cases tested byFISH showed no del22q11 including TOF (2) and PA (2). The remainingcytogenetically normal cases were tested by molecular markers andshowed no evidence of deletions. These results suggest that del22q11does not play a major role in fetal cardiac pathology and that aneuploidy isa more significant factor than del22q11 in this population even when excluding cases ascertained through abnormal chromosomes. ,2001
818,The proband is a 1 y. o. female infant the first child of an unrelated 31 y.o. mother and 33 y. o. father. Two previous pregnancies ended in regress. Chromosome studies showed that the father had a balanced reciprocaltranslocation t(3 14) (p24 q23). The family refused from the prenatal exam ination for this pregnancy. The proband was delivered by C section. Thebaby s weight was 2700 g. and his length was 46 cm. On the 4th day after the birth the baby s status got poorer. The proband was transferred to theintensive care with encephalitis and ulceronecrosic gastritis diagnosis. Thestomach s perforation was operated successfully. At 2 months the babysuffered from sepsis of mixed etiology (Klebsiella and Proteus) at 8months from broncopneumonia. And what s more upper respiratory tractinfection. At 2 and 9 months the proband was tested immunologically decreased serum IgA IgG decreased E rosette formation decreasedactivity of phagocytes were revealed. At the age of 1 the child s height was71 5 cm and weight 9000 g. Dysmorphic features of the face were obvi uos a broad and flat nasal bridge full cheeks a short nose. Chromosomestudies confirmed partial trisomy 3p paternal. In 6 cases previously pub lished children were diagnosed with frequent infections and in 3 cases thedecrease of immunological indexes was established. So we can speakabout immunological disfunction as one of the clinico laboratory charac teristics of the syndrome. ,2001
819,Unbalanced translocation was identified in a fetus with cardiac anomaly at21 weeks of gestation 46 XX der(9)t(7 9)(p21 p23). Parental karyotypeswere normal indicating a de novo origin of the unbalanced translocation inthe fetus. By comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH) we defined the composition of an unbalancedde novo translocation. CGH revealed the DNA amplification at distal 7p(7p21` pter) and the deletion at 9p (9p23` pter). FISH with chromosome7 and 9 painting probes confirmed the partial trisomic status of the shortarm in chromosome 7 and the partial monosomy of the short arm in chro mosome 9. Resampling for special banding to confirm the precise break point was declined and the parents opted for termination at 23 weeks ofgestation. Therapeutic termination of the pregnancy was done. Autopsyshowed cardiac anomalies of right ventricle hypoplasia pulmonary atresiaand left heart enlargement with prominent aorta and urogenital anomaliesof hypoplasia of internal genital organs with cystocele. This case demon strates that FISH and CGH are useful for the identification of chromosomalmaterial of unknown origin. ,2001
820,De novo balanced reciprocal translocations incidentally found at prenataldiagnosis raises serious prognostic dilemmas. In our series of 5 541 pre natal diagnoses during the past 5 years there were 5 cases of de novo bal anced reciprocal translocations. High resolution banding and molecularcytogenetic study (FISH and CGH) were performed as an adjunct to G banding for characterization of the abnormal chromosomes. In two cases there were fetal anomalies found using ultrasound one had thickened fetalmyocardium another had a markedly enlarged right atrium and ventricle. The parents decided to terminate the pregnancy and the autopsy showedconsistent results with the prenatal ultrasound. In the third case a prena tal diagnosis indicated due to thickened nuchal folds at second trimester of230 Posters: Prenatal and Perinatal Geneticspregnancy. Pregnancy was continued and a 3500gm healthy baby was delivered with no anomalies except simian creases on both hands andcryptochidism. At present he is a healthy at the age of 6. In the last twocases there were no fetal anomalies found on the ultrasound. The coupleswere counseled that the risk of phenotypic abnormality from a de novoreciprocal translocation has been estimated at approximately 6.1% [War burton 1991]. Both couples decided to continue pregnancy and deliveredhealthy babies. The children showed normal development during follow upexaminations up to the age of 5 and 2 years respectively. In our series detailed fetal ultrasound including fetal echocardiogram played an impor tant role for predictions of fetal prognosis. ,2001
821,The paper discusses the case of a patient who after the ultrasound find ing was referred to prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis. The analysis of amni otic fluid cells indicated the presence of the following karyotype in thefetus 46 xx / 46 xy. The conformation of this mosaic karyotype was madeby classic cytogenetic analysis and FISH of the cells of peripheral bloodand fibroblast of fetus s skin. Once again this case has indicated that theproblem of mosaic is one of the most difficult problems in prenatal diagno sis. ,2001
822,Since 1993 it has repeatedly been shown that rapid and accurate diagno sis of selected chromosome aneuploidies can be achieved by QuantitativeFluorescent Polymerase Chain Reaction (QF PCR) amplification ofgenomic repeated sequences known as Small Tandem Repeats (STR). Inthe last few years this approach has been successfully used in largeexperimental and clinical trials on hundreds of amniotic fluids and CVSsamples. Due to the early shortage of highly polymorphic STR markers onthe X and Y chromosomes the great majority of studies focused on thedetection of aneuploidies involving chromosomes 21 13 18 and the fetalsex. Recently it has been shown that the newly identified pentanucleotiderepeat X22 which maps in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR 2) of the Xand Y chromosomes together with a modified sequence of the amelogeninregion allows accurate detection of sex chromosome copy number. Wedeveloped a multiplex QF PCR assay including these sequences togetherwith highly informative autosomal STRs for the rapid prenatal detection ofaneuploidies involving chromosomes X Y 13 18 and 21. The test wasused in clinical trial on 551 uncultured amniotic fluids allowing the assess ment of sex chromosome copy number in 100% of samples including onecase of Klinefelter and two of Turner syndrome. In the course of this trial17 autosomal trisomies were also correctly diagnosed. The assay provedto be efficient and reliable allowing the detection of all numerical variationsof the examined chromosomes within 24 hours from collection of the sam ple. ,2001
823,Trisomy 2 mosaicism is very rare in prenatal diagnosis. Published datafrom eleven cases showed a risk >60% for an abnormal outcome. Wepresent a case of mosaic trisomy 2 detected at amniocentesis in a 35 year old G3P2 woman. Amniocentesis was performed at the 16th gestationalweek because of advanced maternal age. There was no family history ofcongenital abnormalities or genetic diseases. The culture of amniocytesand the use of GTG banding revealed a 47 XY +2(4)/46 XY(21) karyotypein two different cultures. At the time of amniocentesis there were no patho logical ultrasonographic findings and the fetus weight was normal for ges tational age. The use of serial high resolution ultrasound examination ofthe fetus for detecting major abnormalities was offered as an alternative option to the couple during genetic counseling. They decided terminationof pregnancy. Fetal autopsy did not reveal malformations. There was nocytogenetic examination for confirmation of the trisomy neither in fetal norin placental tissues. Trisomy 2 mosaicism is related with no specific type ofabnormalities IUGR and fetal demise or stillbirth. The only reported casewith normal outcome had only 4% trisomy 2 cells in amniocytes. Cytoge netic studies have shown confirmation rates about 81 88% in cases withabnormal outcome. Confined placental mosaicism may also be consideredin differential diagnosis while some of the fetuses with trisomy 2 placentalmosaicism may have uniparental disomy. In conclusion the rarity of tri somy 2 mosaicism in prenatal diagnosis makes the diagnostic approach the management and the genetic counseling difficult. ,2001
824, saude.ptCornelia de Lange and Cri du Chat syndromes are well known entitiesdescribed for the first time in 1933 and 1963 respectively. The main fea tures of Cornelia de Lange are bushy eyebrows hirsutism synophrys thindownturning upper lip micromelia and mental retardation in some casesit is associated with 3q26.1 duplication. On the other hand Cri du Chatfeatures are much less obvious and include microcephaly downward slantof the palpebral fissures and mental retardation and it is caused by a dele tion of 5p15. Chromosome studies were performed on amniotic fluid cellsof a 21 years old woman referred for ultrasound abnormalities andrevealed an abnormal karyotype with a derivative of a 3 5 translocationinherited from the mother. The authors describe the ultrasound cytogenet ic and post mortem findings in the foetus terminated at 20 weeks with char acteristics suggesting both Cornelia de Lange and Cri du Chat syndromes. As far as we know this is the first case where both syndromes have beenfound in the same foetus. ,2001
825,Proximal or interstitial 12q deletions are very rare and only six patientswere described previously (Funderbunk et al. 1984 Meinecke and Mei necke 1987 Watson et al. 1989 Tonoki et al. 1998 Rauen et al. 2000 Zollino et al. 2000). All of the reported cases were diagnosed postnataly. The couple were referred to our department because of the advancedmaternal age and the amniocentesis was applied in 18th weeks of gesta tion. The fetal karyotype was revealed as 46 XY/46 XY del(12)(21.32q22)(87/13). This mosaic karyotype was also confirmed by the cordocentesis(86/14) and the pregnancy was terminated at 24th weeks of gestation. Thepostmortem physical examination of the fetus showed minor facial dys morphism. This case is especially important because of the chromosomalabnormality (interstitial 12q deletion) is the first prenataly diagnosed. ,2001
826,As it is known the majority of chromosome abnormalities in newborn relat ed aneuploidies of chromosomes 13 18 21 X and Y are nearly 95 per cent of all the chromosome abnormalities diagnosed prenatally. Full kary otype analysis from amniocentesis and/or CVS have been performed tothe pregnancies at risk for chromosomal syndromes. However it is timeconsuming and labour instensive. Comparative Genomic Hybridization(CGH) employed to uncultured cells has a new to investigate chromosomeaneuploidies. In this study we report the results of the first study evaluat ed the DNA of these samples for CGH analysis of uncultured amnio cytes/CVS. The results of 40 amniotic fluid samples/CVS were analysed byCGH and the results were compared with the ones from standart cytoge netics. CGH allowed accurate sex and chromosome enumeration in 38uncultured amniocytes/ trophoblasts (95%) consistent with the resultPosters: Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 231obtained by traditional cytogenetic analysis. Neither false positive nor false negative results were obtained. Morever the signals/nucleus for eachprobe was also evaluated. This experience demonstrates that CGH canprovide a rapid and accurate clinical method for prenatal idendification ofchromosome aneuploidies and sexes. ,2001
827,Holoprosencephaly and cyclopia is very often result of unbalanced kary otype and influences at early death. We observed partial monosomy 7qwith trisomy 13q as result of familial translocation t(7 13)(q34 q13). Fromliterature data we know that both involved chromosome 7 and 13 areresponsible for holoprosencephaly. Pedigree analysis show sixty memberswith 5 carriers and ten early died children with similar malformations. It wasenough to estimate probability of recurence of unbalanced progeny. Genetic risk was estimated according to the method of Stene and Stengel Rutkowski. Figure 8/29 i.e. 27.6% +/ 8.3% was obtained after ascertain ment corretion. It could be useful for genetic counselling. ,2001
828,Partial hydatidiform moles have triploid chromosome constitution exceptfor few cases where they are diploid. We describe a case of partial hyda tidiform mole with unusual chromosomal findings. A 32 year old womanwhose pregnancy history was remarkable for two previous early fetal loss es presented at 14 weeks gestational age with intrauterine fetal demise. Products of conception after a dilatation and curettage procedure consist ed of two populations of villi one was small and sclerotic and the otherlarge hydropic with trophoblastic proliferation. Some of these hydropic villihad scalloping borders and trophoblastic inclusions. Occasional villi hadblood vessels with nucleated red blood cells. Some sections revealedseverely macerated embryonic fragments. These findings were consistentwith a partial hydatidiform mole. Although almost all partial hydatidiformmoles are triploid a DNA flow cytometric analysis revealed a diploid peak. Chromosomal analysis of the villi as well as the fetal tissue using Fluores cent Suppression In situ Hybridization (FISH) studies using chromosomeenumeration DNA probes revealed trisomy for chromosomes 18 and 21.Products of conception with morphological changes consistent with partialhydatidiform mole but diploid DNA flow analysis should probably be eval uated with FISH to rule out unexpected chromosomal abnormalities. Although hydropic villi have been associated with aneuploid pregnancies chromosomal abnormalities as identified in this case showing typical par tial hydatidiform mole morphology have not been previously described. ,2001
829,We have routinely performed prenatal diagnosis of the most common ane uploidies of chromosomes 13 18 21 X and Y using multiplex quantitativefluorescence PCR on more than 700 amniotic fluid samples. Our resultswere all confirmed by cytogenetics analysis. In most cases results werebased in two informative markers for each chromosome in some cases wehad to use at least three or four markers to obtain a result and occasion ally due to lack of heterozygosity results were based on a single marker fora specific chromosome. We have found that the markers we have usedwere informative in the Greek population also with a heterozygosity fre quency ranging within 0.75 0.90 similar to the frequencies reported in theliterature. There was accordance between the quantitative fluorescencePCR and cytogenetic results in all but 2 cases. We had one false negativeresult of a trisomy 18 and an ambiguous result for which no result wasreported for chromosome 18 (cytogenetic analysis showed a trisomy 18). We detected 21 abnormal cases (trisomy 21 18 13 69XXX and a mosa ic (46 XX(15)/45 X(15)). Additionally more then 30 blood stained amnioticfluids were studied. Only 4 gave ambiguous results (triallelic pattern formost markers or abnormal ratios). The results of this study clearly supportthat quantitative fluorescence PCR for common aneuploidies is an accu rate and rapid adjunct to conventional cytogenetic prenatal diagnosis andcan be used as part of the diagnostic routine in a prenatal unit. ,2001
830,Prenatal diagnosis of chromosome aneuploidies currently involves the cul ture and karyotype analysis of chorionic villus or amniotic fluid samples. The average UK reporting time using this approach is 13.8 days and thereis increasing pressure to develop techniques that provide a more rapidresult. Quantitative fluorescence PCR uses dosage analysis at polymor phic loci and is suited to high throughput. We have set up and assessedQF PCR as a diagnostic test for trisomy 13 18 and 21. Trisomic sampleswere characterised by 3 allele peaks or 1 2 or 2 1 dosage differencesbetween 2 allele peaks. One multiplex PCR was designed to include 10tetranucleotide repeat markers (3 4 and 3 for chromosomes 13 18 and 21respectively). The use of three fluorescent labels enabled all chromosomesto be analysed in a single injection on a capillary based fluorescenceanalyser. DNA was prepared from uncultured amniotic fluid or chorionic villiusing a rapid resin based approach. The strategy was evaluated with blindand pilot studies and QF PCR has now been successfully integrated intoour cytogenetic service. All amniotic fluid and chorionic villus samples aretested and results issued within 3 working days (mean reporting time 1.58working days median reporting time 1 working day). Abnormal results areconfirmed by rapid FISH and all samples have follow up karyotype analy sis. To date 631 diagnoses have been made with no false positive or neg ative results. Our experience of QF PCR as a clinical service over a 12month period (estimated to include 1 200 samples) will be presented. ,2001
831,Prevention of beta globin gene mutations is presently based on prospec tive carrier screening prenatal diagnosis and termination of affected preg nancies. We introduced preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to pre select unaffected embryo and establish healthy pregnancies avoidingpregnancy termination. Using a standard IVF setup the oocytes orembryos were biopsied and tested for the presence of beta globin genemutations by multiplex nested PCR involving simultaneous mutation andlinked marker analysis in single blasromeres for paternal or first and sec ond polar bodies for maternal mutations. Overall 40 PGD cycles were per formed from 26 couples at risk for having children with sickle cell disease(7 cycles) or different thalassemia mutations including IVS1 110 IVSII 745 IVSI 1 IVSI 6 codon 39 619 bp deletion and IVSI 5 (33 cycles). Ofthe 265 resulting embryos with DNA results 101 unaffected embryos werepre selected for transfer back to patients in 40 clinical cycles resulting in14 clinical pregnancies and 7 healthy children born by the present time. The remaining embryos were avoided from transfer either because theywere predicted to contain an abnormal gene or had not available confir matory marker analysis. Of 116 embryos from this group available for fol low up confirmation analysis the genotype was correctly predicted in 114(98.2%) demonstrating a high accuracy of PGD for beta globin genemutations using multiplex nested PCR analysis in single blastomeres orpolar bodies. ,2001
832,Selection of embryos for transfer in IVF is currently based on morphologi cal parameters which do not correlate with chromosomal make up lead ing to incidental transfer of aneuploid embryos. We introduced preimplan tation aneuploidy testing of oocytes to improve the clinical outcome in theIVF patients of advanced maternal age. Using standard IVF procedure the232 Posters: Prenatal and Perinatal Geneticsfirst and second polar bodies were removed following maturation and fer tilization of oocytes in 87 clinical cycles from patients of 39 years and older. Polar bodies were tested for aneuploidies by five color FISH probes spe cific for chromosomes 13 16 18 21 & 22 (Vysis). Overall 56% of oocyteswere aneuploid resulting from errors in the first (40.8%) and second(42.1%) meiotic divisions and were not transferred. The embryos resultingfrom aneuploidy free oocytes were transferred back to uterus and thepregnancy and implantation rates yielded in this group were compared tothat in the control group involving 77 clinical cycles from routine IVFpatients of the same age. On the average 1.8 aneuploidy free embryosper cycle were pre selected and transferred in the test group compared to2.8 in the control. Despite this difference 8% implantation and 14.5% preg nancy rates were observed in the test group compared to 3.4 and 7.9% respectively in the control demonstrating a two fold improvement of theclinical outcome of IVF following pre selection of aneuploidy free embryos. ,2001
833,Preimplantation diagnosis provides an option for avoiding an affectedpregnancy together with pre selection of an HLA compatible donor for anaffected sibling. We performed preimplantation HLA testing for leukemia Fanconi anemia (IVS 4+4 A T mutation) and thalassemia (619bp deletion) the latter two combined with mutation analysis. Haplotype analysis for fam ily members (including father mother and affected child) was performed toidentify different polymorphic STR alleles corresponding to specific mark ers in HLA genes. Linked STRs scattered through HLA genes were appliedto increase accuracy of analysis and detect potential crossover betweenHLA A HLA B HLA C HLA E and HLA DQB genes. Single blastomereswere biopsied in a standard IVF setting and tested by multiplex nestedPCR analysis to analyze simultaneously for mutations linked markers andHLA genes. Genotyping for Fanconi anemia (four cycles) and thalassemia(one cycle) mutations was possible in 33 and 8 embryos respectively 6and 3 of which were affected and 24 and 5 unaffected. HLA testing ofthese unaffected embryos and 28 embryos obtained in clinical cycles forleukemia revealed 13 HLA matched embryos overall including 5 for Fan coni anemia 3 for thalassemia and 5 for leukemia. These embryos weretransferred back to patients resulting in a clinical pregnancy and birth ofan unaffected child in case of Fanconi anemia whose cord blood stemcells have been transplanted to the affected sibling. ,2001
834,Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) combines in vitro fertilisationtechnology with molecular and cytogenetic analysis. PGD is an alternativereproductive option for couples at risk of having a child with a genetic dis order. Huntington s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegen erative adult onset disorder. Individuals at risk can have a gene test priorto the onset of symptoms. Prenatal diagnosis is available but the uptakeis low. PGD for Huntington s disease (HD) has been considered by TheGuy s & St. Thomas Centre For Preimplantation Diagnosis. Coupleswhere one partner has received an HD gene positive test result will be con sidered for PGD treatment. In accordance with the 1990 Human Fertilisa tion & Embryology Act a licence to practise PGD is required from theHuman Fertilisation & Embryology Authority. Unlike other single gene dis orders for which we offer PGD treatment there are several issues relatingto PGD for HD which require special attention. Ã\x86 To ensure accuracy in a PGD cycle HD allele sizes are needed from the non gene carrying partner.Ã\x86 If confirmatory prenatal testing is not undertaken following a successfulPGD cycle no confirmation of diagnosis can be obtained at birth. Ã\x86 Thewelfare of children born into a family where one parent will become symp tomatic of HD. In order to address these issues it has been necessary tocreate a detailed working protocol for the management of PGD for HD. Webelieve that this is the first such document and the details will be discussedin this paper. ,2001
835,Chromosomes involved in reciprocal translocations form quadrivalents atmeiosis. These complexes segregate by alternate adjacent 1 adjacent 2 3 1 or 4 0 modes to give gametes with different balanced or unbalancedchromosome complements. The lack of direct access to female gameteshas meant that until recently data concerning frequency of segregationmode in female carriers has not been easily available. With the develop ment of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for chromosomerearrangements these data are now emerging. We have carried out PGDcycles for 15 couples with translocations of these data were obtained forsix female carriers of reciprocal translocations and three female carriers ofRobertsonian translocations. Following PGD and transfer of embryos witha normal/balanced PGD result the remaining embryos from each cyclewere spread and tested for confirmation of diagnosis and segregationmode. Not all embryos gave informative results as arrested embryos gavenuclear fragments and multinucleated cells made interpretation difficult. Ofthose which gave an informative result 66% (range 60% to 75%) ofembryos (n=48) from female reciprocal translocation carriers were consis tent with alternate segregation compared with 77% (range 60% to 100%)(n=27) for Robertsonian translocations. Interestingly in the reciprocaltranslocation cycles only 16% of embryos were consistent with adjacent 1 segregation the mode that gives rise to the most common unbalancedproducts seen at prenatal diagnosis. Six of the couples established a suc cessful pregnancy following PGD. These results together with further datacurrently being collected will be presented and discussed. ,2001
836,OBJECTIVE Preimplantation genetic diagnosis requests highly sensitivemethods that are very sensitive for contamination to detect genetic alter ations in single blastomeres. Fluorescence polymerase reaction (F PCR)is a reliable method for single cell PCR. This study summarizes our expe rience in the detection X and Y chromosomes for sex determination and inthe detection of delta F508 mutation in single blastomeres. METHODS We analysed 108 blastomeres. 46 blastomeres (23 preembryos) for Ã\x98F508mutation and 62 blastomeres (31 preembryios) for X and Y chromosomes. The amplification of the delta F508 region was performed with CF1a andCF2 primers for the identification of X and Y chromosomes we used theAmelA and AmelB primers. RESULTS 54 preebryos were biopsied suc cessfully (2 intact blastomeres). Amplification of the delta F508 region wassuccessful in 42 blastomeres we accepted results only in cases when thetwo blastomeres from the same preembryo showed the same results. Thiswas the case in 40 preembryos (87%). Detection of X/Y chromosomes wassuccessful in 58 blastomeres (29 preembryos) We could accept the resultsin 28 preembryos (90%). CONCLUSION In our study F PCR appears tobe a reliable method for the preimplantation genetic diagnosis of the deltaF508 mutation and gender determination in X linked recessive disorders. ,2001
837,"To assess the chromosome status of individual blastomeres from humanembryos sequential FISH screen was performed using PB probe (VysisMultiVysion PB 5 color mix of DNA probes for chromosomes 13 16 18 21and 22) followed by X/Y probe (CEP X /CEP Y (alpha satellite) (Vysis Inc.).For both hybridization results were obtained on 100% of the nuclei [42/42]tested. Six nuclei were subject to a third hybridization. In 3 cases the thirdhybridization was to backtrack and complete the screen using PB probewhen a nuclei was detected only on the second sequential X/Y hybridiza tion. In 3 cases a third hybridization confirmed one large signal consistedof two overlapping signals by using single copy probes DGS for 22 CBFBfor 16 and KAL for X chromosome. The technical aspects of this study thatrequire caution in interpretation are in the PB hybridization the aqua andblue fluorescence signals bleed through and hence interpreting the probeslabeled with these fluorophores requires cross checking to see if they areoverlapped or are in different location. Secondly short (4 hour) sequentialhybridization also resulted in the bleed through of the PB green and redsignals from the first hybridization but the carry over of the signals wereeliminated in a longer sequential hybridization (overnight). Conclusion Two sequential hybridizations worked on a consistent basis. In those nucleithat were subject to the third hybridization 100% gave results. This studyshows that our FISH protocol to screen blastomeres is robust and thatthere is a potential for expanding this FISH test to screen ploidy status ofmore chromosomes in sequential hybridizations by populating the screen with more probes per hybridization.

838,The aim of this research was to study women s attitude towards PD thepossibilities of abortion due to medico genetic reasons the birth of defec tive child. Investigation carried out by annonymous questionnaire in 4Maternal Houses of Tbilisi among 922 women with different age and edu cational level. 102 Women refuse to complete a questionnaire. The mostof interviewed women ( 90 2%)prefer the early methods of PD in firsttrimester of pregnancy and in the case of defective fetus they checked anabortion as a right conclusion. Approximately the half of inquiredwomen(48%)considered an abortion as non ethical in the late stages ofpregnancy even of abnormal fetus. There is a relatively large number ofwomen (37%) who suppose doctor s preferance toward their defectivechild s future(Children s home Family). A great majority of all inquired women would like to avoid the problems concerning to defective child sfuture they prefer stillborn defective child rather then living one(40%). Cor relation between age educational level pregnancies and ethical and psy chological attitudes were find out. Conclusion 1. 90 2% of all women pre fer the early methods of Pd 2.Women before the age 25 suppose to carefor defective child in Children s Home the most women aged 25 35 would n t wish to look at their children in Children s Home 3. 47 5% women withhigh education and 10% with secondary education considered that defec tive child must grow up in the family 4. In all groups as early appearsMaternal feeling in women they prefer to care for defective child in thefamily. ,2001
839,Couples are facing with a very difficult decision when a fetal sex chrom some abnormality is identified. The decision is more complicated when theresult of prenatal investigation presents mosaic karyotypes. Postnatalstudies show that even in cases of apparently pure 45 X result there is ahigh possibility of tissue specific discrepancies. Since Turner syndrome isbasically a lethal abnormality it has been proposed that liveborn patientsshould have a mosaic chromosome complement. However it is extremelyproblematic to predict by prenatal investigations that the foetus will havegonadal dysgenesis mixed gonadal dysgenesis with ambiguous genitaliaor normal male with or without infertility. We report eight cases with prena tally diagnosed sex chromosomal anomalies. Studies were carried outboth by conventional cytogenetic methods and FISH from chorionic villiand amniotic fluid. Based on the literature and our results we aim to pres ent a strategy to establish correct diagnosis counselling and management. ,2001
840,CMT disease is a typical example of a dominant non lethal disease with awide spectrum of severity ranging from asymptomatism to severe motorand sensory disability. Since molecular diagnosis is available prenataldiagnosis is required by many at risk families. Our laboratory has to facefrequent requests for CMT prenatal diagnosis. Here we present our expe rience in developping molecular procedures as well as genetic counsellingand psychological issues for at risk parents. Oppositely from adult testing results delay severity s prediction and the elements of the final decisionregarding a possible pregnancy termination are crucial. We thus devel opped a multidisciplinary approach including clinical and molecular geneti cists obstetricians psychiatrists neurologists and patients associations. Inorder to optimize the safety as well as the delay of the results we designed234 Posters: Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 2 spontaneous abortions 5 deliveries 1 ongoing pregnancytechnical molecular procedures potentially allowing a very short result s delay. The ability to use these approaches will be compared to classicalmethods. We insist on the heavyness of the process engaged for the par ents when considering the very high risk pregnancy compared to the ques tions and doubts regarding the phenotype s severity in case of positivediagnosis. Paradoxically the unpredictable degree of severity is also thereason why prenatal diagnosis is required and must be ethically adressed. Ethical questions raised by prenatal diagnosis in CMT evidence thatmolecular diagnosis in non lethal genetic diseases can not be standard ized and should be actively and multidisciplinary considered. Eventually the accessibility of preimplantation embryo diagnosis that our approachshould make feasible will also be discussed. ,2001
841,About 65% of women with an age of 35+ years decide to make use of inva sive prenatal diagnosis during pregnancy in Berlin (Germany). Several fac tors have an influence on this decision. Subject of this study was theimpact of their partners and an evaluation of their knowledge about thediagnostic procedure. Personal interviews with 200 women (35+ years old)who just gave birth to a healthy child and with 117 of their partners arereported. Interviews were conducted on maternity wards of 11 hospitals inBerlin. Males were less well informed about prenatal diagnosis (PD) thantheir female counterparts. The male s level of knowledge depends on thatof their partners. It differs significantly regarding the men s intention tohave a child the size of the family whether or not the woman took advan tage of the invasive PD and which diagnostic procedure she chose (amnio centesis or chorion villi sampling). Males knowledge about PD is depend ing neither on their religion nor on their age. The male s influence on thefemale decision whether or not to undergo invasive PD is small. It does notdepend on the male s knowledge and the magnitude of its impact is esti mated differently by both partners in 25% ,2001
842,Molecular biology approaches has led to new orientation in the fields ofPathobiology Sciences. The consequences of this changes are getting theresult sooner increasing the specifity and sensitivity of the assay and morereliability on the test result. Generally maternal teratogenic infections aredetected by the seroconversion of mother and fetus against the microor ganism Invivo and Invitro culture of microbe from body secretions of fetus amnion fluid and autopsy samples. For this purpose the sensitivity of sero logical assays isolation and culture of pathogen may be insufficient andare time consuming. PCR a very sensitive specific and rapid assay helpsus to detect the teratogen genome in the amnion fluid and plays an impor tant role in prenatal diagnosis of teratogenic infections. In order to extendour Amnion synthesis pannel in this center we have decided to include the infectious teratogen detection ( CMV HSV) by PCR method. So far wehave analysed 40 samples. From these eight HSV positive and two CMVpositve cases were detected. This study is now in progress on more num ber of samples. ,2001
843,Mental retardation provides a basis for the identification of genes involvedin the development of cognitive functions. Here we report on the identifi cation of a gene that is interrupted by an inv(X)(p21.1 q22) in a malepatient with a syndromic form of MR. The Xp breakpoint is positioned in thegene contig Xpter CYBB TCTE1L breakpoint SRPX RPGR OTC Xcen .However a male with normal mental development with a microdeletion onXp21 extending from CYBB to RPGR was reported. Molecular analysis ofthe Xq breakpoint region identified a novel gene called Nuclear eXportFactor 5 (NXF5) that is split by the breakpoint leading to its functional nulli somy. The predicted protein likely is a novel member of the nuclear RNAeXport Factor family since it shows 78% similarity with TAP/ nan,2001
844,A three level ultrasonic screening of pregnant women is held in theMedico Genetic Consulting Centre in Astrakhan. Analysing results ofscreening of 10 14 week pregnancy discovered that > 3 mm nuchaltranslucency of a fetus makes it possible to find out 9% of its chromosomeanomalies. The growing level of the nuchal translucency increases the fre quency of chromosome anomalies in the following proportion when thenuchal translucency is >3mm chromosome anomalies make 9 4 % whenthe nuchal translucency is >4mm chromosome anomalies make 27 % thenuchal translucency >4 mm corresponds to 100 % chromosome anom alies as well as the nuchal translucency of 10 mm.

845,The laboratory of the prenatal diagnostics of the Astrakhan Medico Genet ic Consulting Centre holds prenatal karyotyping of pregnant women of therisk group. The groups are formed when the women turn to the Centre tobe genetically examined. Ultrasonic screening is held at the term of 10 14and 20 24 week pregnancy. Special attention is paid to early diagnosing ofchromosome anomalies at the term of 10 14 weeks. The principal ultra sonic marker of chromosome anomalies is found to be nuchal translucen cy of the fetus > 3 mm. The prenatal karyotyping is held at the term of 10 14 week pregnancy bythe method of transabdominal biopsy of the koryon in the following riskgroups the presence of nuchal translucency 22 cases ( 24 7 % ) the ageof the pregnant woman above 36 years 3 cases ( 3 4 % ) nuchal translu cency in combination with the mentioned age 5 cases ( 5 6 % ) one of thespouses having chromosome reconstruction 6 cases ( 6 7 % ) birth of achild with congenital or hereditary diseases 2 cases ( 2 3 % ) othercases 51 ( 57 3 % ). The total of 89 pregnant women have been exam ined. There were found 8 cases ( 9 % ) of digital chromosome anomalies trisomy 18 2 cases trisomy 21 2 cases monosomy according to sexu al chromosomes 2 cases monosomy according to autosomes 1 case tetraploidia 1 case. The majority of chromosome anomalies was found tobelong to the first risk group. The results of the investigation held made it possible to come to the fol lowing conclusions it is reasonable to hold the first ultrasonic prenatalscreening of pregnant women at the term of 10 14 week pregnancy form ing groups of women with a high degree of the risk of giving birth to chil dren with congenital and hereditary pathology it is necessary to considernot only conventional medico genetic recommendations but the discoveryin the fetus of ultrasonic markers of hereditary and congenital diseases such as nuchal translucency. ,2001
846,Aneuploidy is a leading cause of reproductive wastage. About 50% ofspontaneous abortions have abnormal chromosomal complement. Chro mosomal analysis of the aborted conceptus provides valuable information regarding recurrence risk and possible therapies for the couple. Conven tional karyotyping depends on tissue culture and analysis of metaphasepreparations which is time consuming with high rate of culture failure andfalse results due to maternal cell contamination. Interphase FISH is a pow erful molecular cytogenetic technique which has been used for severalapplications in cytogenetic diagnosis. The objective of our study was tocompare the results of multicolor interphase FISH with conventional chro mosomal analysis for he detection of the most common aneuploidies inspontaneous abortions and to test whether interphase FISH can eliminatethe need for culture in these samples. For this we have used the chromo some specific probes for 13 15 16 18 21 22 X and Y for interphaseFISH analysis on the products of conception from 52 women with recurrentspontaneous abortions. Aneuploidies were detected in 26 samples usingthese probes. Conventional karyotyping in all these samples confirmed theresults of FISH analysis except in 2 cases where the probe for 15 wascohybridizing with polymorphic region on chromosome 14 (thereby show ing false trisomy 15 on the interphase cells) and 2 cases where aneuploidyof chromosome 7 and 17 (for which the probes were not used) weredetected. The results suggest that multicolor interphase FISH overcomesthe limitations of conventional karyotyping and readily identify commonaneuploidies associated with spontaneous abortions eliminating the needfor tissue culture in a substantial number of samples. ,2001
847,The pentasomy 49 XXXXY is one of the rarest sex chromosome defects occurring with an estimated incidence of 1 in 85 000 male births. This con dition is associated with pre and postnatal growth deficiency severe men tal retardation hypogenitalism and other skeletal facial and cardio vas cular anomalies. We report on the prenatal diagnosis genetic analysis ofa 49 XXXXY fetus. A 33 year old primigravida woman was referred for amniocenthesis andquantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF PCR) with smalltandem repeat (STR) markers specific for chromosome 13 18 21 X andY at 16 weeks gestation for positive second trimester triple test (1 16) andincreased nuchal translucency. Quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF PCR) with smalltandem repeat (STR) markers specific for chromosome X and a pentanu cleotide marker X22 for the Xq/Yq pseudoautosomal region PAR2 rapidlydetected the X chromosome polysomy from amniotic fluid cells. Cytoge netic analysis revealed a karyotype of 49 XXXXY. Our case also shows that QF PCR assays with sex chromosome specificSTR markers provide rapid prenatal diagnosis of numerical sex chromo some aneuploidies. ,2001
848,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease charac terized by diverse clinical manifestations and the presence of multipleautoantibodies. SLE affects approximately 1 in 2000 individuals and ismore prevalent in women particularly their reproductive years. There aremultiple etiological factors involved in this pathogenesis. Recent studiesindicate that fetal cells can survive in the maternal circulation for manyyears post partum. This finding suggests that fetal microchimerism couldbe involved in the autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis Sj grens syndrome and scleroderma. We used the polymerase chain reac tion (PCR) to identify Y chromosome sequences in DNA extracted fromperipheral blood cells and renal biopsy from women with SLE and healthwomen both had had male children. We describe the presence of the y chromosome specific sequence in DNA extracted from the peripheral blood and biopsy of women with SLE. These observations provide supportfor the hypothesis that a fetal antimaternal graft versus host reaction maybe an immunopathogenic mechanism in the development of SLE in somewomen.

849,Reported associations between fragile X (FX) mutations and adjacentpolymorphic markers may reflect founder effects as well as microsatelliteinstability (MI). To better understand the bases of mutational processes inthe FX populations we analyzed allele frequencies and mode of inheri tance of DXS584 FRAXAC1 FRAXAC2 DXS1691 DXS1123 andDXS1113 microsatellites in normal and FX individuals in Russia. The studyof inheritance mode for DXS584 FRAXAC1 FRAXAC2 DXS1691 DXS1123 and DXS1113 revealed 3 DXS548 4 FRAXAC1 and 2 DXS1123unstable FX maternally derived meioses among 54 tested thus showingthat not only an FMR1 (CGG)n repeat is unstable on FX chromosomes butother microsatellites as well. The proximal bounder of the region of FX associated microsatellite instability is no closer than 150 kb to FRAXA(DXS548 being unstable) and the distal bounder is no farther than 1.8 Mb(DXS1123 being unstable and DXS1113 being stable). The boundaries ofthis region coincide with the boundaries of delayed replication zonedetected on X(q27.3 q28) in the cell lines from the FX patients. Spreadingof late replication zone changes the replication timing leading to the inabil ity of mismatch repare system to correct the replication mistakes naturallyoccurring in repetitive sequences and in trinucleotide repeats particularly. It means that FX mutations arise not on a specific haplotype background but are themselves results of specific occurrences of MI thus dependingnot solely on the internal properties of FMR1 (CGG)n repeat but on thechromosomal background as well representing an example of positioneffect on human X chromosomes. ,2001
850,The P2X7 receptor is a ligand gated cation selective channel which medi ates ATP induced apoptosis of cells of the immune system. We and othershave shown that P2X7 is non functional both in lymphocytes and mono cytes from some subjects. To study a possible genetic basis wesequenced genomic DNA coding for the carboxy terminal tail of P2X7. In 9of 45 normal subjects a heterozygous nucleotide substitution (A1513C)was found while 1 subject carried the homozygous substitution whichcodes for glutamic acid to alanine at amino acid position 496. Surfaceexpression of P2X7 on lymphocytes was not affected by this A1513C poly morphism demonstrated both by confocal microscopy and immunofluores cent staining. Monocytes and lymphocytes from the A1513C homozygoussubject expressed non functional receptor while heterozygotes showedP2X7 function which was half that of germline P2X7. Results of transfec tion experiments showed the mutant P2X7 receptor was non functionalwhen expressed at low receptor density but regained function at a highreceptor density. This density dependence mutant P2X7 function was alsoseen on differentiation of fresh monocytes to macrophages with interferon gamma which upregulated mutant P2X7 and partially restored its function. P2X7 mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes was impaired in homozygousmutant P2X7 compared with germline (8.6% versus 35.2%). The data sug gest that the glutamic acid at position 496 is required for optimal assemblyof the P2X7 receptor. nan,2001
851,Methods were developed using long range amplification to sequence allthe 89 exons of the LRP1 gene and the entire LDLR gene (exons 2 18 andintrons) on individual DNA samples. Analysis of 3 test groups of 22 healthyindividuals 29 Alzheimer patients and 18 individuals with different clinicaland molecularly uncharacterized lipid metabolism problems revealed 5coding polymorphisms in de LRP1 gene i.e. A217V A775P D2080N D2632E and G4379S. No genetic defect was evident in the LRP1 gene ofany of the AD patients further excluding LRP1 as a major genetic problemin AD. LRP A217V (exon 6) was present in the 3 groups as a normal poly morphism while D2632E was observed only once in a healthy volunteer. On the other hand LRP1 alleles A775P D2080N and G4379 wereencountered only in patients with FH or with undefined problems of lipidmetabolism. This finding forced us to analyze their LDLR gene entirelyfrom exons 2 to 18. This yielded a sequence contig of 33 567 nucleotides and thereby finally an exact physical map of the LDLR gene. This cor rects the published and web posted maps in many positions and includenot only the exact size but also their content of about 250 Alu relatedrepeat sequences distributed all over the gene. In addition 4 novel LDLRmutations that cause FH were defined i.e. del e7 10 exon 9 mutationN407T a 20 bp insertion in exon 4 and a double mutation C292W/K290Rin exon 6. No evidence for pathology connected to the LRP1 mutationswas obtained by subsequent screening for the 5 LRP1 variants in largergroups of 110 FH patients and 118 patients with molecularly undefined clinical problems of cholesterol and/or lipid metabolism. In three individu als with a mutant LDLR gene also a variant LRP1 allele was present butwithout direct obvious clinical compound effects indicating that the variantLRP1 alleles must at this moment be considered polymorphisms. ,2001
852,Four different putative splicing mutations in the CFTR gene have beenstudied by analysing mRNA extracted from nasal epithelial cells harvestedfrom patients with cystic fibrosis and one heterozygote with reccurentepisodes of pneumonia. Four patients carried the 621+3A>G mutation (2with F508del 1 with 1898+1G>T and 1 with W1282X) 1 carried the2751+2T>A ( with F508del) another the 296+1G>C ( with 3130+1G>A)and 1 heterozygote 1717 9T>C (with D565G and R668C in cis). For eachcase two non CF control subjects were also studied for the appropriatecDNA fragment. The 621+3A>G mutation resulted in activation of an alter native splice site within exon 4 (28.3Ã¢\x80\x935.9% of total cDNA) and skipping ofexon 4 (6.75Ã¢\x80\x931.35% of total cDNA). The 2751+2T>A mutation resulted inskipping of exon 14a (52.6% of total cDNA) the 296+1G>C mutationresulted in skipping of exon 2 (56% of total cDNA). The patients carryingthe above mutations presented with PI and all except the patient carryingthe 296+1G>C mutation were diagnosed between birth and 8mos. Muta tion 1717 9T>C resulted in skipping of exon 11 as a minor product andskipping of exons 9 and 11 as a major product.

853,Mitochondrial NAD+ dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase(SSADH OMIM 271980) deficiency is a defect in the GABA degradativepathway that results in 4 hydroxybutyric aciduria a rare inborn error ofmetabolism inherited in an autosomal recessive manner [1]. We hadalready identified and physically mapped the SSADH gene in 6p22 [2].Analysis of cDNA clones encompassing the entire coding sequenceallowed to predict a 535 residues amino acid sequence (accession n. Y11192). We used this information to detect the first two mutations thataffect SSADH expression by causing exon skipping during mRNA matura tion [3]. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of two SSADHmRNAs (about 4 and 2 Kb) whose relative abundance seems to vary indifferent tissues. These data suggest that although having a central role inthe cellular metabolism a tissue specific expression of the SSADH genecould exist. The different length of the two trascripts could be partially dueto the alternative usage of two polyadenilation signals that we identifiedand localized 78 bp and 2 Kb downstream the ORF. In order to investigatethe qualitative and quantitative difference between the two mRNAs we firstdecided to identify putative promoter region(s) through transfection ofreporter gene constructs cloning different portions of 5 Kb region upstreamthe ATG start codon. The results show that a 180 bp region immediatelyupstream the ATG is able to drive considerable activity of the luciferasereporter gene as contrasted with more distal DNA portions.

854,PTCH1 gene is a human tumor suppressor frequently gene mutated inbasal cell carcinoma (BCC) and several other tumor types. It encodes areceptor for soluble factors of the hedgehog family. Binding of hedgehog tothe receptor relieves its inhibitory action on the transmembrane co recep tor SMOH. In this study we described alternative first exons of the PTCH1tumor suppressor gene and shown that they are differentially regulated innormal tissues exon 1B being expressed at very low levels and the majormRNA species containing exon 1 or 1A. Exon 1B transcripts were found tobe specifically upregulated in nodular BCCs. All PTCH1 alternativelyspliced isoforms encode proteins that colocalize and interact with SMOH indoubly transfected cells. Furthermore functional assays demonstrated thatwhereas all PTCH1 isoforms can inhibit the activity of SHH only thePTCH1B isoform is capable of fully inhibiting SMOH activity. These resultsindicate that in tumor cells the PTCH1B promoter is specifically activatedand importantly that the N terminal part of PTCH1 including exon 1B isrequired for full inhibition of SMOH signaling but not for physical interactionwith SMOH. ,2001
855,Stage specific interactions between Sertoli cells and germ cells are centralin the regulation of spermatogenesis but their molecular mechanisms arestill poorly understood. In the present study a differentially expressedgene named THEG which is specifically expressed in spermatids is char acterised. Its expression is up regulated by some unknown factor/s fromSertoli cells. The gene is approximately 10 kb pairs in size and contains 8exons. The ORF of 376 amino acids encodes for a 42.7 kDa putativenuclear protein. To elucidate the potential role of the THEG we deleted thegene in mice through homologous recombination. Both male and femalemice heterozygous for THEG mutation appeared normal and fertile. Homozygous male and female mice also exhibits normal phenotype how ever THEG / male mice are infertile. Further molecular histological andphysiological analyses are in progress which will give us insights into thecritical role of THEG protein in male germ cell development. The cellulartype and subcellular localization of the THEG protein in the testicular sec tions of adult mice were determined by immunostaining with a polyclonalantibody against THEG protein. A predominant signal was detected in thenucleus of round spermatids whereas no specific staining was observedin other germ cell stages and in somatic cells. A human homologue ofTHEG (hTHEG) was cloned. The complete genomic structure was charac terised from sequence analysis of a genomic hTHEG PAC clone and fromthe release of the working draft sequence of the human genome in theGenBank. ,2001
856,This study focused on the influence of dietary L carnitine supplementationon the transcription rate of carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT 1A andCPT 1B) which are key enzymes of fatty acid metabolism. The expressionof these enzymes is related to the metabolic availability of L carnitinewhich is decreased in aging subjects and in metabolic disorders such ashyperlipidemia. mRNA of all samples was determined by the LightCyclerSYBR green technique (RT LC PCR). In animal experiments 100mg/kg/bw/d L carnitine was administered orally to old (21months) maleSpraque Dawley rats for a period of 3 months. Old (21 months) and adult(7 months) control animals received tap water exclusively. Livers from car nitine treated old rats showed an 8 12 fold higher transcription rate regard ing ratios both of CPT/ÃÂ§ actin and CPT/G6PDH. Further PBMC (peripher al blood mononuclear cells) from 10 healthy humans and 5 patients withhyperlipidaemia type IV were analyzed. In cases with hyperlipidaemia typeIV we observed an up to 100 fold increase in CPT transcripts relative to ÃÂ§ actin or G6PDH (glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) after at least 4weeks of L carnitine supplementation (1g/d) but no further rise when in acomparable range to controls. To our knowledge this is the first report todate providing direct evidence for a stimulatory effect of dietary L carnitineon the transcription rate of CPT in PBMC. This appears to reflect a meta bolic situation comparable to that in liver. Thus this study provides a non invasive approach for monitoring the effect of L carnitine deficiency and L carnitine supplementation on oxidative metabolism. ,2001

The main aims of this work were an isolation of new GC rich human minisatellite andthe search for its homologs in animals. The computer analysis of the cos mid with a 34175 bp clone of human DNA performed by Dr G. Vergnaud revealed the presence of gene containing a minisatellite sequence in oneof its intrones and named nan,2001
859,Nucleoporins (NUPs) are the main components of nuclear pore complex(NPC) which are involved in the regulation of bi directional trafficking ofmolecules especially mRNAs and proteins through the nucleoporesbetween nucleus and cytoplasm. We have obtained the completesequence and genomic organization of the gene for human NUP155 oneof the most abundant nucleoporins in the NPC by sequencing and anno tating a 165.6 kb human BAC clone. The human NUP155 gene is estimat ed to be 90 kb in length and contains 36 exons. It is expressed in all thetissues tested with two major alternatively spliced transcripts resulted fromthe alternative usage of a 5 cryptic splice donor in Intron 1 and twopolyadenylation signals. We have also cloned a full length cDNA of themouse Nup155 gene as well as the Nup153 a Nup155 orthologue fromthe pufferfish (Fugu) genome which is only 9 kb in length with similargenomic organization but much smaller introns. Comparative analyses ofthe NUP155 orthologues in human mouse rat Fugu Arabidopsis Drosophila and yeast reveal a loss of one of the two paralogues increased numbers of introns in higher organisms and highly conservedamino acid sequences in eukaryote evolution. The regions harboring theNUP155 orthologues in the human and Fugu genomes have different geneorders advocating cautious interpretation of synteny in comparativegenomics analysis even in the vertebrate lineage. ,2001
860,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous mutations of thesurvival motor neuron gene 1 (SMN1). SMN located on chromosome5q13 is part of an 800 kDa protein complex with a crucial role in snRNPbiogenesis pre mRNA splicing and a presumable function in neural trans port. In rare cases sibs with identical 5q13 homologs and identical SMN1mutations can show variable phenotypes suggesting that SMA is modifiedby other yet unknown factors. Recently we excluded SIP1 and Htra2 beta1 two SMN interacting proteins as putative SMA modifying genes. Here we report the analysis of Gemin3 and Profilin II two further SMN interacting proteins as putative SMN modifiers and searched for muta tions/polymorphisms using DHPLC. We studied the complete codingregion in 36 sibs belonging to 15 SMA families displaying identical 5q13haplotypes and SMN1 mutations but variable phenotypes. Two differentpolymorphisms were detected in Gemin3 exon 11 but with no significantassociation to the phenotype. To look for quantitative differences betweentranscription isoforms and the total amount of RNA we performed quanti tative analysis of RT PCR products from 26 sibs of 11 families with identi cal genotypes without identifying any significant difference between phe notypically discordant sibs. Based on these data we suggest that theintrafamilial phenotypic variability in SMA families is not caused by poly morphic variants or transcription differences within Gemin3 or Profilin II. ,2001
861, magdeburg.deThe candidate tumor suppressor gene DICE1 is located within a previous ly reported LOH critical region telomeric to the RB1 gene in chromosomalregion 13q14.3. Intron/exon mapping of the DICE1 gene revealed 18exons that are preceded by a GC rich promoter. The DICE1 mRNA isexpressed in a variety of normal tissues and it is downregulated in tumorcells suggesting tumor specific inactivation of DICE1 by gene silencing. Inadult brain an alternatively spliced DICE1 transcript (ASP1) has been iden tified that appears to be differentially expressed. In the variant DICE1 tran script ASP1 exon 3 is spliced out which results in a DICE1 protein lackinga potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site. In order to determineexpression of the DICE1 mRNAs in different brain regions RT PCR basedexpression profiling of a regional brain panel was performed. Expressionof DICE1 was observed in frontal and temporal lobe cerebellum substan tia nigra caudate nucleus thalamus hypothalamus pons medulla andspinal cord but not in hippocampus and amygdala. The ASP1 transcriptappears to be expressed predominantly in substantia nigra. From theseresults we conclude that in the brain alternative splicing and expression ofthe DICE1 mRNA is regulated in a region specific manner. ,2001
862,During spermatogenesis spermatogonia undergo extensive mitotic divi sions forming primary spermatocytes which then remain in an extendedpremeiotic G2 phase bevor entry into two meiotic divisions and producehaploid spermatids. Several genes that regulate the meiotic division inDrosophila have recently been identified. In the male homozygous for amutation in pelota gene the germline mitotic divisions are normal but thecell cycle arrests prior to the first meiotic division. The resulting 4N germcells in testis of pelota mutants develop to spermatids with head and tail. The continued differentiation of 4N spermatids after meiotic failure sug gested that the pelota gene is required only for transition of the germ cellsfrom premeiotic G2 phase to the meiotic phase. To understand the functionof pelota gene in mammals we have isolated the murine and human geneand determined its chromosomal localization. The predicted murine andhuman proteins share a 65 % sequence identity with the Drosophila pelotaprotein. Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analy sis reveal that the pelota gene is present as a single copy gene in murineand human genome and is localized on murine chromosome 13 and onhuman chromosome 5q11.2. Northern blot analysis indicates that thehuman gene is expressed in two alternative spliced mRNAs ( 1.6 and 2.1kb ). The 1.6 kb mRNA is found in all tissuse studied while the 2.1 kb tran script is detected predominantly in testis. To determine the function of thepelota gene in mammalian spermatogenesis we have generated thePelota mutant mice and analysed the phenotype of homozygous mutant. In contrast to normal development of the Drosophila pelota mutant thepelota deficient mice die in theearly embryonic development. ,2001
863,Several recent observations suggest that LINE1 mobile elements may notonly represent junk DNA. The finding that they can co mobilise 3 tails which may be relevant both for exon shuffling and other regulatory func tions raises the question of whether and how these elements may functionin the genome. We carried on functional as well as phylogenetic studies onan atypical LINE1 element LIPMA2 which contains an unusual 3720 bptail at its 5 end. A truncated (but preserving the 3 end 800 bp of the tail)LIPMA2 element is normally present in the dystrophin gene intron 11 andis involved in a deletion causing a dystrophinopathy. We have defined thisrearrangement finding out that it brought the LIPMA2 tail close to a crypticsplice site and caused a splicing pathology. This observation suggests thatPosters: Gene Structure and Function 239the LIPMA2 5 tail might play a role in the splicing process. In order to func tionally and phylogenetically investigate this novel element of L1 class wefirstly tested by Zoo blot and PCR/sequencing the presence of the 3 end800 bp of the LIPMA2 5 tail in genomic DNA of several species. Resultsshowed that this sequence is a primate specific repeat element thatappeared firstly in lemur at least 25 45 million years ago when the line age of the common ancestor of old world monkeys and hominoidsemerged. Comparative analysis also showed that The LIPMA2 5 tail con tains several regulatory motifs particularly in its 3 end (last 800 bp) thatare adjacent to the LINE1 consensus and at least 7 tail regions are wellconserved among primates as well as human chromosomes. In order tofunctionally test this tail we used a reporter construct containing the beta globin exon 2 intron 2 splicing borders and beta globin exon 3 under theT7 promoter control for in vitro transcription. We inserted in this constructthe entire 3 end 800 bp of the tail. We also made a control construct sim ilar in length and containing the full beta globin intron 2. From these twoconstructs together the control construct DNA templates have beenobtained by PCR and have been in vitro transcribed. A splicing assay wasthan carried out using HeLa cell extracts as splicing substrate. The exper iments showed that the construct containing the LIPAM2 tail is affecting thebeta globin splicing. The presence of several regulatory motifs including atleast one purine rich SR binding site and other transcription controllers inthe conserved regions together with the splicing capacity of this tail sug gests that it may represent a conserved non coding sequence (CNS). Thisobservation might have several implications in the general role(s) retropo son related sequences may have in genome plasticity.

864,Electrophoretically pure ceruloplasmin receptor (CpR) which is the proteinof metabolic copper system (MCS) in mammalian was isolated fromhuman erythrocyte membranes using the affinity chromatography. Theclone containing the insert of CpR cDNA was isolated from the expressioncDNA library from human placenta. The comparative BLAST analysis ofthe two sequencing clone fragments in the GenBank database showsthese sequences are homologous to human Cp cDNA. The 638 b.p.sequence (NAF211154) contains fragments that are homologous to Cpexons 4 7 (81% identity). The deduced amino acid sequence has 83% ofidentity to E216 Ã¢\x80\x94 E427 segment of Cp. One of the two glycosylated sitesof the compared Cp region remains unchanged in CpR. All ligands formononuclear copper type 1 site of Cp are conservative in CpR. The 257b.p. sequence (NAF211153) has 76% sequence identity with Cp cDNAexon 16. This deduced amino acid has no homologies to any a.a.sequences in the Genbank database. According to the analysis with thePC/GENE system it contains a putative transmembrane domain. Thus wecan relate CpR to the family of transmembrane CP like proteins. The com puter analysis of 20 proteins participating in MCS of various organismsusing CLUSTAL W and PHYLIP programmes found out CpR sequenceNAF211154 is the most similar to Cp Heph and Fet3. CpR sequenceNAF211153 is the most similar to Aso and Ccc2. This data make us thinkthat Cp CpR and Heph have a common ancestral gene with Fet3 from S.cerevisiae. ,2001
865, u.ac.jpCED (MIM *131300) or progressive diaphyseal dysplasia (DPD1) is anautosomal dominant disorder characterized by hyperosteosis and sclero sis of the diaphyses of the long bones. We identified in 10 CED families (8Japanese and 2 Caucasians) four different missense mutations (R218H R218C C223R and C225R) in the TGFB1 gene at a domain correspon ding to the C terminus of LAP of latent TGF beta1. TGF beta1 is translat ed as a precursor protein with 390 amino acids and dimerized by a disul fide bond at the cysteine residues. The TGF beta1 precursor protein con sists of signal peptide LAP and mature TGF beta1. LAP associates with mature TGF beta1 by noncovalent binding and represses the activation aslatent form. To know how these mutations cause CED we performed func tional analysis of mutated TGF beta1. Pulse chase analysis and ELISArevealed that all mutations cause instability of the TGF beta1 and LAPcomplex and the increase of free TGF beta1. This instability is inhibited byin vitro administration of dexamethasone. The results gave an insight intonot only the pathogenesis of CED but also the function of TGF beta1 inbone remodeling. ,2001
866,Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an autosomal recessive disease inwhich the absorption of cationic amino acids is defective in small intestineand renal tubules. This leads to excretion of cationic amino acids in urine. The symptoms associated with LPI are caused by defective amino aciduptake leading to protein malnutrition which causes growth failure andosteoporosis. The absorption defect also causes vomiting and sometimeshyperammonemia after protein feeding and children with LPI often devel op protein aversion. LPI belongs to the Finnish disease heritage butappears globally. All together there are more than 100 LPI cases world wide of which half of the cases are reported in Finland. LPI is caused bymutations in SLC7A7 (solute carrier family 7 member 7) gene encodingy+LAT 1 amino acid transporter polypeptide. The SLC7A7 gene comprisesof 11 exons and 10 introns spanning about 48 kb of genomic DNA. AllFinnish patients have the same founder mutation 1181 2 A T or LPIFin asplice site mutation leading to a 10 base pair deletion in the cDNA level which is absent elsewhere. The patients outside Finland have a variety ofdifferent mutations. y+LAT 1 (y+L amino acid transporter 1) has 12hydrophobic transmembrane domains 6 extracellular and 5 intracellularloops. Both the carboxy and amino termini are cytoplasmic. The y+LAT 1protein forms a heterodimeric structure with the 4F2 cell surface antigenreceptor heavy chain (4F2hc). The heterodimer is responsible of thecationic amino acid transport activity on the basolateral membrane of thepolar epithelium cells in the small intestine and renal tubules. In this study the cellular localization of the wild type and mutant y+LAT 1 is studied byusing GFP reporter protein fusions in different cultured cells. Also the het erodimeric interactions of y+LAT 1 with the 4F2 heavy chain are studied byusing fluorescent microscopy and fluorescent fusion proteins of both of thesubunits of the active transport system. ,2001
867, kiel.deNitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of many cellular processes including inflammation necrotic and apoptotic cell death. NO is producedby the enzyme nitric oxide synthase which is competitively inhibited byendogenously produced asymmetrically methylated arginine residues. Theenzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) specificallyhydrolyzes these methylated arginines to citrulline and methylamines andthereby regulates NOS activity and thus the NO level in vivo. During theidentification and characterization of a new apoptosis inducing gene BCL10 mapping to the human chromosomal region 1p22 we identified thehuman DDAH1 gene. This gene is highly conserved during evolution. It isalmost identical to the rat DDAH gene and shows considerable homologyto genes encoding arginine deiminases from B. burgdorferi P. aeruginosa S. pyogenes and C. elegans. The gene structure of the human DDAH1implies 6 exons of 627bp 102bp 73bp 119bp 143bp and 572bp (includ ing 5 and 3 UTR) interspaced by five introns of 31kb 7169bp 971bp 8491bp 25.5kb und 3171bp. Electronic expression analysis of DDAH1revealed wide expression of the DDAH1 gene. Remarkably in renal tumortissue DDAH1 was significantly downregulated as compared to normalrenal tissue implying a role of DDAH1 in the pathogenesis of renal cell car cinomas. To identify mechanisms leading to downregulation of theDDAH1gene in renal tumors we screened the six exons of DDAH1 formutations of the coding region by PCR SSCP and partial sequencing. In20 renal cell carcinomas analysed no inactivating mutations wereobserved. Subsequently monoclonal antibodies were raised against the240 Posters: Gene Structure and Functionrecombinant DDAH1 protein. Current immunhistochemical experiments with these antibodies address for other mechanisms like mutations in reg ulatory elements which could result in decreased expression or mRNAinstability.

868,Cerebral capillary malformations (CCM) also known as cerebral caver nomas are vascular malformations of the brain. These malformations areusually multiple and consist of dilated capillary venous channels whichtend to grow in size. The average age of clinical presentation is 33 yearsand the most common symptoms include headache seizures and cerebralhaemorrhage. CCMs often show familial aggregation and genetic linkagehas been established to three chromosomal loci 7q21 22 (CCM1) 7p13 15 (CCM2) and 3q25.2 27 (CCM3). Identification of mutations in the CCM1gene encoding KRIT1 (Krev 1 Interaction Trapped 1) has provided the firstclue to the molecular mechanisms causing CCM. In addition we showedthat vascular defects caused by CCM1 mutations are not restricted to cere bral vasculature but can also cause cutaneous lesions defined as hyperk eratotic capillary venous malformations. However CCM1 mutations havenot been identified in all the families linked to nan,2001
869,The ADAM (a disintegrin and a metalloprotease)protein family consists ofat least 31 members wich are all characterized by the presence of metal loprotease and disintegrin like domains. The latter has been suggested tomediate cell cell and cell matrix interactions by binding to appropriatereceptors of the integrin type. In this poster we present data concerningfour ADAMs genes that are only expressed in testis testase 1 testase2 testase 3 and ADAM 27. Testase 1 2 and 3 show high homology to eachother and to ADAM 20 human orthologous gene to the mouse fertilin a The three testases probably function as active metalloproteases. ADAM 27is more related to cyritestine a putative adhesion protein which was foundto be necessery for mouse fertility. All of these proteins are precisely regu lated during postnatal testis development. Testase 1 expression was foundto start at day 5 testase 2 at day 20 testase 3 at day 5 ADAM 27 at dayday 15 of the postnatal testis development. Two of these genes testase2and ADAM 27 are expressed exclusively in male germ cells. RT PCRanalyse revealed that testase 2 was haploid and the other three ADAMswere diploid expressed. In order to investigate the function of these genes knock out mice are generated. The results of these functional analysesare reported. ,2001
870,Cooperative binding of ligands to DNA lattice may arise in result of twotypes of interaction between ligands bound to DNA. Firstly there are directcontact interactions or any other kind of short range interactions betweenligands that occupy adjacent base pairs. An example of contact interac tions is glue ends of subunits of lac repressor that govern their assem bling on DNA. Secondly there are long range interactions that areoccurred due to alteration of DNA structure or/and DNA charge densityaround bound ligands or of the whole DNA molecule. Various antibioticsand drugs metal ions and many other compounds give rise to such inter actions. In our recent work (1) we showed that some types of long range(but not short range) interactions may give rise to ligand binding to DNAwith the character of phase transition. Such sharp transition may becaused by changes in DNA topology or by DNA condensation. Here westudy influence of energetics and stoicheometry of binding on the charac ter of phase transition. Physical meaning of these transitions is discussed.1. Lando D. Y. Teif V. B.

871,Mutations in the BIGH3 gene are responsible for autosomal dominantcorneal dystrophies (CD) linked to 5q. CD lattice type I is associated withamyloid deposits and an R124C mutation while the Groenouw type I pro duces non amyloid deposits and is due to an R555W sequence variation. We investigated the mechanisms leading to deposits in 5q31 linkedcorneal dystrophies. Although these 2 mutations represent hot spots othersequence variations have been reported in lattice type I like phenotypes. Methods The full length BIGH3 sequence without stop codon was ampli fied from plasmids pGEM BigWT pGEM BigR124C and pGEM R555Wand subcloned in pEGFP N2 to give pEGFP BigWT pEGFP BigR124Cand pEGFP BigR555W. The non classical mutations N622K G623D H626R and V631D were introduced using oligonucleotides directed muta genesis to give pEGFP BigN622K pEGFP BigG623D pEGFP BigH626Rand pEGFP BigV631D. Apoptosis was measured in transiently transfectedHeLa and HCE a human corneal epithelial cell line by Hoechst /PI nuclearstaining after 24 or 48 hrs of culture. Results The following rates of apop tosis were observed in HeLa (and in HCE) pEGFP 3% (4.1%) pEGFP BigWT 2.5% (2.8%) pEGFP BigR124C 12% (16%) pEGFP BigR555W 14.7% (9%) pEGFP BigG623D 8% (8%) pEGFP BigH626R 6%(7.6%) pEGFP BigV631D 13.5% (8.7%). Measurement of LDH activityshowed similar differences between the constructs. Conclusion Transientoverexpression of mutated BIGH3 in HeLa and HCE cells induces apopto Posters: Gene Structure and Function 241sis. These results indicate that apoptosis plays an essential role in cornea dystrophies and amyloid formation.

872,Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is soluble copper contained glycoprotein which func tions as an universal transporter of the copper (Cu) ions. We were shownthat specific molecular form Cp is synthesised by mammary gland cellsand its is secreted to milk. 7 fold decrease of Cp concentration in samplesof breast milk during 20 days of lactation period was demonstrated and Cpmolecule contains 5 7 Cu atoms. So the level of Cu (10 (g/kg body weight)is constant at the breastfeeding. Therefore in the newborns Cu balance iscontrolled at the transcriptional level in mammary grand cells. By comput er analysis of the 5 flanking region of rat CP gene we found a potentialsites for nuclear hormone receptor RORalpha1 for estrogen and proges teron and specific cis elements liver expression genes (HNF 1) and genesexpressed in mammary grand (WAP). This region of CP gene (1700nucleotides) was amplificated. Gel shift analysis shown that PCR productcontain the specific sites for 9 cis retinoic acids and thyroid hormonereceptors. Also PCR product bound TF from liver and mammary glandwere different. A fragment (2.3 kb) chromosome Cp gene was cloned inpTZ19. The fragment hybridized with Cp cDNA containing from 520 to2620 nucleotides of the Cp mRNA. Antibodies to TF YY1 are detected YY1protein in the 2 3 kb DNA\\TF complex. The data were approved by gel shiftanalysis. The YY1 protein was identified by western blot hybridizationmanly in TF fraction from liver of adult rats. It is possible this data indicateexistence of the tissue specific regulation of CP gene expression on thetranscriptional level. ,2001
873,Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinasesplay critical roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferationof diverse cell types (1). Molecular cloning and biochemical studies identi fied PKC enzymes as members of a distinct family that constitutes at thegene level nine mammalian members i.e. alpha beta gamma delta epsilon zeta eta theta & iota. In this study we have performed fine chro mosomal mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization employing cosmid BAC & PAC probes of all 9 PKC isoforms. As result the human PKC genesare not clustered and found at single loci. Additionally employing HUGOand bioinformatic tools genomic organization analysis of the PKC genes as well as the search of neighboring polymorphic markers (useful forgenetic linkage analysis) has been initiated. Comparison of chromosomallocation of these fine mapped PKC gene loci with human disease gene loci(and known orthologous regions within the mouse map) is currently per formed. Along with tissue specific and restricted spatial pattern PKCisoenzyme expression information from biochemical signal transductionwork and the phenotype of the established mouse PKC KO lines (loss of function) will permit genetic studies in defined groups of patients in searchfor PKC associated genetic defects/abnormalities.

874, freiburg.deMembers of the gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) gene family are onchromosome 22q11 a region prone to rearrangements and deletions thatcause human congenital anomaly disorders including Cat Eye (CES) Velo Cardio Facial/Di George (VCFS/DGS) and derivative 22 (der(22))syndromes. Low copy repeats (LCR) in 22q11 containing sets of repeatedgenes of which GGT is one seem to mediate deletions or duplications. GGT is a major enzyme of glutathione (GSH) homeostasis and the induc tion of GGT in response to oxidative stress is an essential element of thecellular response to oxidative injury. In order to determine whether any ofthe GGT genes may be involved in disorders assigned to 22q11 it wasessential to clarify their exact chromosomal localisation and organisation. We have identified GGT gene specific DNA sequences by sequencingYACs and PACs containing different GGT genes. Using these sequences we have localised six GGT genes to a 6 Mb region of 22q11 via Blastsearches in human chromosome 22 DNA sequence. We have named themost proximal gene GGT 13a to distinguish it from a nearly identical genewhich lies more distal GGT 13b. Previously named GGT genes 3 and 11 occur on different YACs which map to the identical chromosome 22q sequence location so are most likely allelic. Genes 1 and 2 consist only ofexons 8 to 12 which represent the functional domain of the protein. Gene6 is the most distal gene and is adjacent to gene 2. Sequence comparisonsof the different genes indicate two groups of nearly identical genes withineach group GGT 13 like comprising genes 3/11 13a and 13b and GGT6 like comprising genes 1 2 and 6. The exact localisation of these geneson chromosome 22q has allowed us to highlight polymorphic markerswhich can be used in genetic studies to test the possible involvement ofthese genes in the above mentioned disorders. ,2001

876,The connexin (Cx) gene family codes for protein subunits of gap junctionchannels which permit the rapid exchange of ions and metabolitesbetween neighbouring cells. Mutations in genes encoding connexins havebeen identified in various human inherited diseases especially skin dis eases and hearing loss. We have recently shown that mutations in theGJB6 gene encoding Cx30 are responsible for Hidrotic Ectoderma Dys plasia (Clouston syndrome) a rare genodermatosis. Another mutation ofGJB6 was also identified in non syndromic autosomal dominant deafness. The control of GJB6 expression in various human tissues appears as a keypoint to understand the molecular basis of these two diseases. In order tolocalise the promoter region of GJB6 we reconstructed the genomic struc ture of the gene. A complete GJB6 cDNA was cloned by 5 RACE from ahuman brain cDNA library. The sequence of this full length cDNA was com pared with genomic sequences obtained from BAC clones previouslymapped in this region. We found that GJB6 is composed of 4 exons span ning more than 10 kb of genomic sequence. The coding sequence isentirely contained in exon 4. The identification of the transcription initiationsite allowed us to localise the promoter and start to study it. By analysingthe genomic sequence around GJB6 we were able to position two othergenes encoding connexins GJB2 encoding Cx26 and GJA3 encodingCx46. These 3 connexin genes are clustered in a region of 60 kb. This con nexin region on chromosome 13q11 could be the result of duplicationevents of an ancestral common gene. ,2001
877,Hfb1 brain specific sequence (Acc. No. Y15167) was obtained from thehuman cDNA forebrain cortex library. The genomic clone from the humanchromosome 5 cosmid library hybridizing with Hfb1 was investigated. Thenucleotide sequence more than 4 kb in length (Ghfb Acc. No. AF318943)was determined for the part of this genomic clone.100% identity betweenthe 5 end of Ghfb sequence and 3 untranslated region of the human com plexin 2 mRNA was revealed by the comparison of Ghfb with thesequences from the GenBank database. Long transcripts with their 5 endscoinciding with the human complexin 2 sequence and 3 ends coincidingwith Ghfb sequence were revealed by RT PCR. These data make us pos sible to suppose that Hfb1sequence is the part of yet not described humancomplexin 2 gene exon which is coding for one of the possible ends of thecorresponding mRNA. PCR screening of the GeneBridge 4 RH panelusing Ghfb specific primers allowed to map Ghfb sequence within the 5q35chromosomal region. The localization site for Ghfb appeared to be near thesame with that determined for human complexin 2 gene thus confirmingthe close vicinity of these two sequences. ,2001

Thisnew gene spans more than 40kb of genomic sequence on 21q22.1(between SYNJ1 and C21ORF49 genes) and is split in 20 exons. C21orf66is expressed in all 20 adult and foetal tissues tested except colon andstomach. Alternative splicing permits the synthesis of 4 mRNAs encodingproteins of 469 511 835 and 917 amino acids that contain several NuclearLocalisation Sequences an S1 RNA binding domain and a PfamB 3456domain of unknown function. The occurrence of these domains suggeststhat this protein is localised in the nucleus and binds RNA. C21orf66 pro tein is strongly homologous to a putative C.elegans peptide (F43G9.12 27% identity over 758 residues). Double stranded RNA interference ofF43G9.12 leads to 90% or more embryonic lethality as well as low post embryonic growth (Nature vol 408 2000). Almost the full length mousehomologue cDNA has been cloned and showed 90 % amino acid identitywith the human protein. C21orf66 overexpression might consequently dis turb pre mRNA splicing general cellular translation and lead to some phe notype causing C21orf66 to emerge as a good candidate for some of theDown syndrome phenotypes.

Antisenseinhibition of endogenous TDP43 expression increased inclusion of exon 9.Paradoxically SR proteins inhibit exon 9 splicing through the interactionwith sequences located both in the coding region and in intron 9 where wehave mapped an Intronic Splicing Silencer. Interestingly some missensemutations such as G424S I444S and A455E previously considered tocause CF only by altering protein function showed an aberrant splicingpattern in transient transfection assay indicating that the nucleotidechanges affect exonic splicing enhancers. Therefore mutations in theexons and the composition of the (TG)m(T)n polymorphic repeats affectalternative splicing and can lead to phenotypes of variable severity accord ing to the individual concentration of splicing factors. In addition antisenseinhibition of TDP43 may provide a new therapeutic target to correct exon 9skipping. ",2001
880,The SALL1 gene encodes a putative zinc finger transcription factor (1324aa) which is mutated in Townes Brocks syndrome.

881,A common 7q11.23 heterozygous deletion of ~1.6 Mb that arises as a con sequence of unequal crossing over between highly homologous repeatblocks has been defined in the great majority of Williams Beuren syndrome(WBS) patients. Up to 17 18 genes located in the deleted interval havebeen reported to date. A map of the ortologous region showed that theorder of the intradeletion genes is fully conserved in mouse. Based on thephysical maps and high throughput genome sequences from both speciesreleased by the Genome Projects we have identified seven novel geneslocated between WBSCR14 and ELN by comparative analysis using theintegrated NIX service (http //www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). On Northern blots the novel genes (provisionally named WBSCR16 22) are expressed assingle transcripts with sizes ranging from 1.2 to 4.5 kb and with variableintensities in the different tissues. We have characterised the completecDNA and genomic structure of 5/7 genes while two genes are still incom plete at the 5 end. Homology searches and prediction of putative proteindomains suggest these new genes code for 1 a DNAJ family member 2 an alpha/beta hydrolase 3 a new claudin family member 4 two differentmethyltransferases and 5 two novel proteins with no predicted domains. Idenfication of all genes in the WBS critical region is required to definethose whose haploinsufficiency may contribute to the clinical phenotypeand to establish precise clinical molecular correlations in patients with par tial deletions. ,2001
882, hamburg.deClC 2 is a member of the large family of voltage gated chloride channelswhich includes at least nine different members in mammals. Expression ofClC 2 mRNA correlates with the presence of a hyperpolarization activated244 Posters: Gene Structure and Functionchloride current with similar voltage dependence and kinetics as ClC 2. ClC 2 is almost ubiquitously expressed. Though ClC 2 is largely closedunder resting conditions it can be slowly activated by strong hyperpolar ization. In the Xenopus oocyte expression system ClC 2 can be activatedby osmotic cell swelling suggesting a role in the regulation of cell volume and by acidic extracellular pH which was postulated to be important forgastric acid secretion. It has been proposed that expression of ClC 2 incertain neurons ensures an inhibitory response to GABA by preventingintracellular chloride from rising above its electrochemical equilibrium. Immunocytochemistry has revealed that ClC 2 is expressed in apicalmembranes of respiratory epithelial cells the same site where CFTR isnormally expressed. To investigate the physiological role of ClC 2 we gen erated ClC 2 null (ClC 2 / ) mice. ClC 2 / mice developed at the expectedMendelian ratio and appeared normal at gross morphological evaluation. Life expectancy was not altered. Lung development was normal and res piratory related symptoms were absent. We did not observe spontaneousepileptic seizures nor did we find an altered response to the seizure induc ing agent flurothyl. Secretion of gastric acid was not reduced in Clc 2 / mice. Though female Clc 2 / mice were fertile we observed a progressivedegeneration of the testes in Clc 2 / mice leading to male infertility. ,2001
883,As functional genomics becomes proteomics researches will look for eas ier less time intensive ways in which to express isolate and detect pro teins. Epitope tagging is a recombinant DNA technique by which a proteinis made immunoreactive to a pre existing antibody. A short amino acidsequence (epitope tag) is incorporated into the primary sequence of arecombinantly expressed protein the tagged protein is expressed and canbe detected and purified with antibodies directed against the epitope tag. Epitope tags are small and they have minimal if any effects on the biolog ical function of the tagged protein. Epitope tagging eliminates the time con suming work of producing a new antibody every time a different protein isstudied. So epitope tagging is a technology which simplifies the detection characterization and purification of proteins. Here we describe the use ofthe bovine papillomavirus type 1 E2 protein sequence SSTSSDFRDR asan epitope tag. The new tag E2Tag can be fused to the N or C terminusor in the middle of the protein and the activities of the tagged proteins havebeen tested in different assays including Western blot assay immunofluo recsence staining of cells immunoprecipitation as well as the DNA bindingand DNaseI footprinting assays. The anti E2Tag antibody interaction withits respective epitope tolerates high salt concentrations up to 2 M NaCl this permits immunoprecipitation and immunopurification of the taggedproteins in high salt buffers and reduction of the nonspecific binding of thecontaminating proteins. We suggest that the E2Tag is a useful tool fordetection and purification of proteins. ,2001
884,Alterations of the cardiac action potential due to dysfunction of heart spe cific ion channels are known to cause cardiac arrhythmias. Recently muta tions in different ion channel genes have been identified in families withlong QT syndrome a cardiac repolarization abnormality leading to ventric ular tachycardias and sudden cardiac death. However nothing is knownyet about the molecular basis of various other common rhythm abnormali ties of the heart. The KCND3 gene encodes the Kv4.3 A type potassiumchannel a molecular correlate of the cardiac transient outward current Ito. In the present study we cloned the Kv channel interacting protein 2(KChIP2) cDNA from human heart and identified two functional splice vari ants of the gene. The human KChIP2 cDNA encodes a 252 amino acid pro tein and is expressed in heart and brain. Using functional expression of theKv4.3 and KChIP2 proteins in Xenopus oocytes we show that KChIP2interacts with Kv4.3 and modifies its biophysical properties. The resultingcurrent resembles the native cardiac transient outward current suggestingthat KChIP2 contributes to the heterogeneity of Ito in human heart. The Itocurrent is important for the initial fast repolarisation of the cardiac actionpotential and dysfunction of this current may lead to an abnormal action potential duration and thereby may cause cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore we further analyzed the genomic organization of the KChIP2 gene whichconsists of 9 exons and determined its chromosomal localization usingFISH analysis. Subsequently a mutation screening test was establishedfor both the KCND3 and the KChIP2 gene which will allow targetedscreening for mutations in patients with various forms of arrhythmias. ,2001
885, halle.deThe mouse chromosome 2 segment (MMU2) corresponding to humanchromosome 20 (HSA20) is known to be involved in both maternal as wellas paternal noncomplementation (genomic imprinting). Uniparental dis omies for distinct regions of MMU2 result in different neonatal lethalitieswith opposite anomalous phenotypes strongly suggesting the presence ofimprinted genes in this region. These chromosomal regions show a con served synteny of gene loci to human 20q13 segment predicting the pres ence of imprinted genes in this syntenic human chromosomal region. Twomouse models have been generated carrying reciprocal translocationswhich served to define chromosomal segments of the parental sourceeffect. We have identified a new gene in this region of interest which islocated on a BAC RPCIB753L051096 proximal to GNAS1 on HSA 20q13.Cloning and sequencing the full length cDNA revealed a novel isoform ofthe human RAB22 subfamily of small GTP binding proteins playing animportant role in the regulation of vesicular trafficking. Based on the ESTWI 12997 this new isoform was isolated containing 2242 nucleotides andis designated RAB22A. Structurally the RAB22A encodes a polypeptide of194 amino acids which has 97% identity to the canine rab22a. Northernblot analysis revealed ubiquitous expression slightly increased in heart. The genomic structure was solved by database analysis and sequencingof the isolated BAC clone. The gene consists of 7 exons spanning about50 kb of genomic sequence.

886,With the completion of the human genome project a huge amount ofsequence data is available for genomic analysis and the challenge is toPosters: Gene Structure and Function 245understand the roles of gene products. Although functional clues are obtained by database comparisons a significant number of predictedgenes remains unclassified. We here describe one such a case a newgene family with at least three members in human and orthologous genesin mouse yeast Arabidopsis and Drosophila. The first human memberwas found while searching candidate genes for Retinitis Pigmentosa andadditional members were identified on the basis of sequence homology. Toapproach function Northern analysis and GFP fusion proteins are beingperformed for the human members. Additionally yeast knockouts havebeen constructed and their phenotypes are being characterised. ,2001
887,The mutations of the Hfe gene which are most commonly associated withhemochromatosis are H63D and C282Y. They are easily tested for by PCRamplification of exons 2 and 4 of the Hfe gene followed by diagnosticrestriction enzyme digestion. To date our laboratory has performed testingon more than 3500 individuals. In one individual we observed altered PCRfragments which suggested the presence of a deletion of exon 2 of the Hfegene. The affected individual is a 32 year old female of Celtic descent. Thepatient who is described as being very thin presented with malabsorption nonspecific abdominal pain and swollen arthritic fingers. Increased ferritinlevels were present while a liver biopsy did not reveal evidence of abnor mal iron stores. She has had one normal pregnancy. Treatment by phle botomy resulted in reduction of ferritin levels to below normal after theremoval of six units of blood. Further investigation of this individualrevealed that she is a compound heterozygote for the C282Y mutation aswell as a deletion of exon 2. A 22bp deletion of the Hfe gene beginning atresidue 369 (Accession # NM_00410) was confirmed by sequence analy sis. The deletion results in the addition of 30 nonspecific amino acidsbeyond the alanine residue at codon 48. This to our knowledge is the firstreport of a truncating mutation in the coding region of the Hfe gene that isassociated in humans with iron overload. ,2001
888,The transcription factor like nuclear regulator (TFNR) is a novel humangene that maps on 5q13 distally to the duplicated region which includesSMN1 the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) determining gene and allowedus to design an evolutionary model of the SMA region. TFNR showshomology to yeast BÃÂ«ÃÂ« protein which is required for transcription of bothTATA less and snRNA type RNA polymerase III promotors and thus is anessential factor of the basal RNA polymerase III transcription machinery. Northern blot and transcription start point analysis allowed us to determinea transcript length of ~ 10 kb. The TFNR transcript is highly expressed incerebellum and weakly in all tissues tested. TFNR encodes a 2254 aminoacids (aa) protein. The protein contains a SANT domain and ssDNA anddsDNA protein interactions were shown. Immunocytological studiesshowed that the TFNR protein is highly expressed in the granule cell layerof the cerebellar cortex. Based on its proximity to SMN1 and its expressionin the cerebellum we investigated several SMA patients with large dele tions in the SMA region. Quantitativ analysis of an SMA patient with cere bral atrophy showed a heterozygous deletion of TFNR and no mutation inthe remaining copy. Therefore we speculate that the cerebral atrophy isdue to a hemizygous effect of TFNR. Human and mouse antibodies fromthe N and C terminus were established and will allow ontogenetic andfunctional analysis of TFNR. The construction of a TFNR knock out mouseis in progress. ,2001
889,We have isolated and characterised a novel murine gene Gtf2ird2 whichappears to be a member of the TFII I transcription factor family of genescontaining a unique helix loop helix domain (HLH). These genes are clus tered together in a region of conserved mouse human synteny on chro mosome 5G. The two members of this family TFII I (Gtf2i) and BEN(Gtf2ird1) contain large multiple HLH domains unlike other basic HLH pro teins suggesting more complex multiple roles. In fact TFII I has beenshown to be a multifunctional phosphoprotein with roles in transcriptionand signal transduction and BEN is thought to be involved in transcription al regulation. The primary sequence of Gtf2ird2 contains two HLH domainswith homology to the HLH domains present in six copies in both TFII I andBEN. Although the role of Gtf2ird2 is unknown this motif homology sug gests that it belongs to this unique family of HLH transcription factors. Gtf2ird2 is expressed as a 3.5kb transcript in most adult tissues tested buta smaller transcript (~3kb) is found in testis. The ORF encodes a protein of936 amino acids with a molecular weight of 104578Da that is predicted tobe slightly acidic. Structurally Gtf2ird2 comprises 16 exons and spans agenomic region of 33.940kb. We have also isolated the human orthologue(GTF2IRD2) located on 7q11.23 within the duplicated region flanking theWilliams syndrome (WS) critical region. WS is a developmental disorderwith characteristic physical cognitive and behavioural traits caused by amicrodeletion of ~1.5Mb. Of all the deleted genes only haploinsufficiencyfor elastin has been associated with a WS phenotype (the heart abnor mality SVAS). Functional and mouse studies will be required to determineif hemizygosity for GTF2IRD2 contributes to the aetiology of the syndrome. ,2001
890, erlangen.deRecent data prove that the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is alter natively transcribed from promotors A B and C. Promotor A is active inmyelinating Schwann cells and contains elements important for peripher al nerve specific expression. Promoter B is predominantly activated in non neuronal tissues and transcript C appears in relatively high amounts intumor cell lines carrying a 7 to 11 fold PMP22 amplification. The tumor celllines used were SF763 (glioblastoma) and RH30 (osteosarcoma).Tran script C has also been identified in human fetal lung and albeit at lowerlevels in sciatic nerve tissue. With the gene racer method gaining full length cDNA clones we discovered that transcript A always starts from adistinct nucleotide. However transcript B and C revealed multiple startingpoints in several distinct regions and furthermore from neighbouringnucleotides. Additionally we studied the effect of CpG island methylationin the PMP22 promotors B and C by methylation specific PCR performedwith DNA from sciatic nerve leucocytes and tumor cell lines. In leucocytesand sciatic nerve the two promotors did not contain methylated CpGs. However hypermethylation of promotor B was discovered in SF763 whichindicates a silencing effect. In RH30 most copies of promotors B and Cwere methylated but the few remaining hypomethylated copies were obvi ously sufficient for strong expression of nan,2001
891,Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are strongly associated with cancer cellinvasion and metastasis tumor neovascularization and other pathologiessuch as inflammation arthritis cardiovascular and neurodegenerative dis eases. Increasing understanding of the role for MMPs in complex regula tory and extracellular matrix remodeling processes has stimulated thesearch for novel genes encoding proteinases with unique functions regu lation and expression patterns. To date about 20 human MMP genes havebeen cloned and partially characterized. In our strategy for identification ofnovel genes we combined subtraction of the known MMP genes fromgene libraries and enrichment of the pool of unknown MMP genes usingthe magnetic bead technology followed by PCR with degenerate primersand RACE. This facilitated identification and cloning of three novel genesMMP 21 MMP 26 and MMP 28 with relatively low representation inhuman cDNA libraries.

Catalytic domains of the novel pro teins were expressed in E. coli and partially characterized in terms of sub strate specificity and inhibition by natural and synthetic inhibitors of MMPs.246 Posters: Gene Structure and FunctionThe unique amino acid sequence and transcription regulation of these genes by transcription factors such as AP1 AP2 AP4 Sp1 RORA suggesta critical function of these enzymes in malignancy. ,2001
892,Cytoplasmic Ca2+ level is an evolutionarily old signal used throughout thelife cycle of an organism in an universal yet versatile manner providing aregulatory crosstalk between different signaling pathways. Restoring theresting state and avoiding lethally high Ca2+ concentrations expellingCa2+ through ATP driven pumps and Na/Ca exchangers is essential forcell survival and function. The exchangers characterized as having lowaffinity yet high capacity for intracellular calcium fall into two classes (NCXand NCKX) according to their K+ dependence and stoichiometry of action. All the NCKX genes analyzed here perform 4Na+ exchange for 1Ca2+ plus1K+. We have determined full genomic structures for three distinct humangenes encoding K+ dependent Na/Ca exchangers NCKX1 (stretches>40kb in 15q22 has 4 alternative transcripts of 10 9 8 and 6 exons) NCKX2 (encompasses 272kb in 9p22 has 2 alternative transcripts of 10and 9 exons) and NCKX3 (covers 150kb in 20p12 encodes 2 alternativetranscripts of 17 and 16 exons). Analysis of their promoter regions and cis regulatory elements as well as functional domains reveals highly con served motifs important for transcriptional regulation and function. Com plete mRNA sequences have been refined based on 5 and 3 RT PCRand underlying genomic clone sequencing results (additional sequencetracks are added to those available in public databases). We also presentcomparative expression patterns of the alternative transcripts of the threegenes. Additional data from this study specific expression of NCKX1 andNCKX2 in retinal photoreceptors and their involvement in light adaptationbrings all the three genes forth as good candidate disease genes for inher ited retinopathias. ,2001
893, magdeburg.deIn a search for candidate genes for X linked mental retardation (XLMR) wehave cloned from Xp11 the human gene 11B6 (meanwhile known asMAGE D) containing 13 exons and covering 8.3 kb of genomic DNA. Theopen reading frame for 606 amino acids contains several nuclear localiza tion signals. The deduced protein sequence shows about 30% similarity tothe MAGE proteins and necdin with highest similarity in the central part(aa286 480) of the protein. The 2.2kb mRNA is expressed in brain skele tal muscle heart placenta and pancreas and in lower amounts in kidneyand lung. Northern analysis in various rat tissues revealed highest expres sion in a brain subfraction (brain stem striatum thalamus and hypothala mus) and in skeletal muscle. In situ hybridization studies in rat brainrevealed prominent labelling in the hippocampal formation nucleussupraopticus cerebellar purkinje cells and plexus choroideus. In situhybridization in rat testis revealed high expression in Leydig cells in con trast to the expression data of other MAGE genes mainly expressed inspermatogenic (mouse Mage a Mage b) or Sertoli cells (rat MAGE D1/SNERG 1). By sequencing the exons as well as the exon/intron bound aries in 6 independent XLMR patients with linkage in this critical region nocausative mutation could be detected. Five single nucleotide polymor phisms (SNPs) encoding synonymous amino acids have been identified inthe protein coding sequence. The allele frequencies of these SNPs havebeen determined in different ethnic populations. ,2001
894,Friedreich ataxia is the most common autosomal recessive ataxia. Almostall cases are caused by a homozygous (GAA)n expansion in intron 1 resulting in decreased levels of frataxin a highly conserved mitochondrialprotein that is thought to prevent toxic iron accumulation in mitochondria. With the aim to better understand the function of frataxin we have gener ated transgenic mice expressing different levels of human frataxin. The fulllength human frataxin cDNA was inserted into a pCI neo vector under thecontrol of the CMV promoter. Three independent lines were established with copy number ranging from 1 to 6. Overexpression was confirmed atRNA and protein levels and high levels were found in several tissues butparticularly in heart and pancreas. However because of the inactivation ofthe CMV promoter during early embryonic development these transgenicscould not rescue the early embryonic lethality of the homozygous frdaknock out. Transgenic mice up to one year of age did not show any obvi ous abnormality. Detailed studies of iron metabolism mitochondrial func tion and resistance to oxidative stress are in progress. Preleminary resultsshow that plasma iron and total serum iron binding capacity are in the nor mal range and resistance to the cardiotoxicity of adriamicin which isthought to be mediated by an oxidative stress mechanism is notincreased. ,2001
895, heidelberg.deOne of the strongest candidates for the azoospermia factor (AZF) is theDAZ (Deleted in Azoospermia) gene family exclusively expressed in malegerm cells and mapped to the AZFc male fertility locus located in distalYq11 (Vogt et al. 1996). AZFc deletions are a major cause for the occur rence of male infertility as they were found in men with idiopathicazoospermia or severe oligozoospermia with a frequency between 4 20 %(Vogt 1998). Recent analysis of the DAZ gene cluster by restriction map ping Fiber FISH and sequence analysis in different men identified a vari able number of DAZ gene copies in AZFc (3 DAZ genes Yen 1997 4 DAZgenes Saxena et al. 2000 7 DAZ genes Gl ser et al. 1998) suggestingthe presence of DAZ pseudogenes. We therefore set out to identify thoseDAZ gene copies which are essential for human male fertility by DAZ copyspecific transcription and translation analyses and by a molecular screenfor partial DAZ deletions in men with severe oligozoospermia. For the iden tification of partial DAZ deletions the structure of each DAZ gene copy wasmarked by a set of single nucleotide variants (DAZ SNVs) and DAZ copyspecific restriction maps. In this way a series of copy specific DAZ haplo types were established and screened for their presence in the AZFc locusof patients with severe oligozoospermia. Up to now 3 individuals with par tial DAZ deletions were identified and confirmed by Southern blottingexperiments (Fernandes S. et al. in prep). Our results identify DAZ1 as thefirst DAZ gene copy essential for human male fertility.

896,UFD1L gene encodes for the human homologue of the yeast ubiquitinPosters: Gene Structure and Function 247fusion degradation 1 protein an essential component of the ubiquitin dependent proteolytic turnover and mRNA processing. Although UFD1Lgene has been mapped in the region commonly deleted in patients withDiGeorge syndrome (DGS) it is not clear the link between its haploinsuffi ciency and some specific features of the DGS phenotype. Since aUfd1l/Npl4 protein complex has been recently described in rat we havecloned and characterised the human counterpart of the Npl4 gene. HumanNpl4 gene encodes for a protein showing 96% 44% 34% homology withNpl4 from rat C. elegans S. cerevisiae respectively and similarly to the C.elegans and rat orthologs contains a single C terminal RanBP2 zinc fingermotif. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) experiments on humanmetaphases localised the Npl4 gene on the most telomeric region of chro mosome 17q. Northern blots analysis on fetal and adult human tissuesrevealed a ~ 4.5 Kb transcript most abundant in heart brain skeletal mus cle and kidney. Given the involvement of the yeast Npl4p in the nuclear tar geted protein transport the identification of the Ufd1l/Npl4 complex inmammals reveals a potential relationship between nuclear transportdefects and the DGS phenotype. Npl4 gene could therefore be considereda good candidate to perform mutations screening in patients with DGS andno detectable 22q11 deletion. Work supported by Telethon grant 364/biand nan,2001

898,To understand the role of histone acetylation in genomic imprinting wehave investigated the status of histone acetylation of imprinted loci inhuman 15q11 q13 which is associated with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS)and Angelman syndrome (AS) and the syntenic region in mouse 7C. Weperformed Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using anti acety lated histone H3 and H4 antibodies to assess histone acetylation. Lym phoblastoid cells from PWS and AS patients and controls as well asfibroblasts from PWS and AS model mice carrying a 4 Mb deletion andcontrol mice were used. We have previously identified parent of origin spe cific histone acetylation confined to the CpG island of SNURF SNRPN. Inthis study we extended the study to 6 human loci including 5 paternally expressed loci (MKRN3 MAGEL2 NDN SNURF SNRPN and IPW) and1 maternally expressed (UBE3A) as well as 4 mouse paternally expressed loci (Mkrn3 Magel2 Ndn and Snurf Snrpn). Although the CpGisland of SNURF SNRPN demonstrated a clear difference of histoneacetylation other human loci did not demonstrate such parent of originspecific differences even in the CpG island of those genes where parent of origin specific DNA methylation has been demonstrated. In contrast inmouse fibroblasts the maternally derived inactive allele is less acetylatedthan the paternally derived active allele at all tested loci with the moststriking difference detected at the CpG island of Snurf Snrpn. These find ings suggest that 1) histone acetylation may not strictly correlate with the DNA methylation status at each imprinted locus and 2) chromatin structureof the imprinted domain may vary between mouse fibroblasts and humanlymphoblasts. ,2001
899,It has been known that some infertile men with azoospermia andoligospermia have microdeletions in the Y chromosome. However the fre quency of such microdeletions among the infertile men is unknown. Wehave studied 14 men with azoospermia and oligospermia. Our study con sist of 18 primer pairs that are homologous to previously identified andmapped sequence tagged sites. These primers amplify nonpolymorphicshort DNA segments from Sthe Y chromosome when used in polymerasechain reactions. Primers have been combined into four sets for using inmultiplex PCR. Molecular deletion analyses of azoospermic and oligosper mic males have suggested existence of Azoospermia Factor(AZF) residingin deletion intervals 5 and 6 of the human Y chromosome and coincidingwith three functional regions associated with spermatogenic failure. Addi tionaly it was investigated fourth AZF region called AZFd which is locatedbetween AZFb and AZFc. Of 14 patients we found microdeletions lying indifferent regions of in three (21.4%) cases. ,2001

This insert termedexon 10a 2 qualifies as an exon as it is surrounded by splice sites with suf ficiently high splice site scores contains no in frame stop codon and doesnot alter the reading frame of the following in frame exon 10b. This addi tional splice product was expressed in HeLa cells at a level of 10% of thewildtype allele.

Sequence comparison between exon 10a 2and the NF1 sequences of fugu rubripes and drosophila melanogastershowed no high homology. Investigation of the putative 10a 2 proteinsequence suggests that its predisposes to transmembrane helices. To testthis fusion proteins of EGFP and NF1 exon 9 to 10b were expressed inHeLa and brown melanoma cells. Fusion protein without exon 10a 2showed only a cytoplasmic localization.

Because the protein is incomplete and deleterious its mRNAis often rapidly degraded by a mechanism termed nonsense mediateddecay (NMD).A CD15 nonsense mutation was found in portuguese beta thalassemia carriers (Ribeiro et al. Brit. J. Hematol. 1992) and cloned. Surprisingly the corresponding mRNA was expressed at levels similar towild type in vivo as well as in vitro (Romao et al. Blood 2000). Since theCD15 mRNA is not subject of NMD there is a therapeutic interest in study ing if this mutation may be suppressed. It is known that some aminoglyco side antibiotics may suppress nonsense mutations during translation bycompeting with protein factors that promote the release of the polypeptidefrom the ribosome. In order to test this hypothesis murine erythroleukemic(MEL) cells were cotransfected with the CD15 nonsense mutated gene or as a positive control with the wild type gene and the puromycin resist ance gene (selection marker). The pools of transfected cells were inducedto erythroid differentiation i.e. to transgene expression and the aminogly coside G418 was added in varying concentrations. Cytoplasmic extracts ofMEL cell pools expressing either transgene in the presence or absence ofG418 were prepared and protein expression analysis was performed byimmunoblotting. Preliminary results indicate that the amount of beta globinresulting from suppression of CD15 is low. For a quantification transfect ed MEL cell lines are currently being subcloned from the pool. ,2001
903, erlangen.deP0 is a well characterized cell adhesion molecule playing a crucial role dur ing myelination in peripheral nervous system. GFP is a helpful tool toobserve cellular events in vivo and is multiple used for this purpose in var ious cells or even organisms. P0 mutations cause Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1B (CMT1B) Dejerine Sottas Syndrome (DSS) and congen ital hypomyelination (CH) diseases of different severity even if the sameposition is substituted by different amino acids. We used two insect celllines S2 and HighFive in order to develop an adhesion test system todetermine effects of P0 mutations. We analyzed 3 pathogenic mutationsfor their effect on adhesion capability in a S2 cell system and found a directcorrelation of adhesion capability and severity of the disease phenotype. We constructed fusion proteins with GFP for P0wt and one mutation tovisualize the effect in vivo both on the intracellular localization and on thechanges in the adhesion capability. The GFP P0wt fusion revealed theexpected adhesion capability and moreover the membrane insertion of thefusion protein was clearly visible in a fluorescent microscope. The GFP P0mutation showed expression but no membrane insertion and mayexplaine the lack of its adhesion capability. Hence this system is suitableto predict the severity of the phenotype based on expression of in vitromutated P0 and visualize the effect of mutations in vivo. ,2001
904, ulm.deMutations at splice sites or surrounding sequences have been reported tocause aberrant splicing. Splicing errors however can also occur withoutsequence alterations. We investigated three tumor suppressor genes foraberrant splicing in tumors. At a low frequency per exon it was found for 5of 7 investigated in frame exons of the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)gene for 2 of 3 exons of the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene and for1 of 3 exons of the tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2) gene. It was detectable inall human tumor tissues tested (NF1 neurofibroma sporadic intramedullar neurinoma sporadic meningiomas NF2 schwannoma NF2 meningioma basalioma and naevus) as well as in cultured tumor cell lines and culturedprimary cells. Hence our data show that aberrant splicing is a very com mon process. According to simulations of the secondary structures of thepre mRNA we suggest that it is due to the rare occurrence of alternativestructures at the splice donor site not recognised by the splice machinery. In HeLa cells aberrant splicing is increased at elevated temperature andlow pH in vitro conditions often found in tumor tissues. We suggest thatincreased aberrant splicing due to environmental factors represents anadditional mechanism for reduction of the amount of tumor suppressormRNA in the absence of relevant mutations in the tumor. nan,2001
905,Our work performed in beta thalassemia and HbLepore heterozygotes withvariable levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) has shown that one importantcontribution to the observed HbF elevation comes from cis actingsequences located in the betaglobin gene cluster. The genetic markersconsist of two polymorphic microsatelites lying in the Agamma globin IVS2gene [(TG)n] and 5 to beta globin gene [(AT)xTy]. We observed a statisti cally significant correlation between the presence of allele (TG)13 in Agam ma IVS2 in linkage disequilibrium with the C to T transition at 158 ofGgamma gene and HbF elevation. The AgammaIVS2 has been previous ly identified as a region required for the inducible expression of gammaglobin gene by hemin. To further characterize this region we have foot printed two introns with different (TG)n alleles and have analysed regionsof interest by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Through these studies weidentified two binding sites for the erythroid regulatory factor GATA 1 andfive sites bound by general transcription factors (Sp1 NF1 YY1 BP1 andOct 1). Additionally we have found in the two alleles studied [(TG)13 and(TG)9(CG)5(TG)8] that the microsatelite region interacts with different pro teins. These proteins not yet identified are present in adult erythroidnuclear extracts. All these data suggests that AgammaIVS2 contains DNAelements functionally relevant for gamma to beta globin gene regulation. We started to test the functional importance of the Oct 1 binding site by aPCR based method of site directed mutagenesis in the (TG)13 allele. Thenormal and mutated introns were inserted into a plasmid p2gÃÂ§301 (a giftfrom Dr. Swee Lay Thein) able to express the gamma and the beta genesunder the control of HS2 site. We are currently performing stable transfec tion assays with the normal and the mutated constructs into MEL cells toinvestigate if the Oct 1 site is functionally relevant for the gamma globingene expression.

Den Dunnen G. B. Van OmmenLUMC Leiden The NetherlandsJ. C.Dorsman@LUMC. NLSeveral neurological disorders are caused by the expansion of a trinu cleotide repeat. The largest group of these diseases including Hunting ton s disease (HD) and several spinocerebellar ataxia s (SCAs) are asso ciated with an expansion of a (CAG)n repeat in the coding region of thegene. Since the instability of the (CAG)n repeat lies at the DNA level thereis no a priory reason why the sequence (CAG)n or its complement (CTG)nwould not occasionally be translated as (Gln)n (Leu)n (Ser)n (Ala)n or(Cys)n depending on reading frame and translated strand. Yet in the neu rodegenerative disorders only Gln repeat expansions are found while theoccurrence of repeats encoding (very) long stretches of other amino acidshas not been documented. To understand this observation and to deter mine the potential effect of other repeats we transformed mammalian cellswith constructs expressing different single amino acid stretches. To over come the inherent instability of long homogeneous trinucleotide repeats weemployed the redundancy of the genetic code to express homogeneoussingle amino acid stretches from mixed sequence DNA oligomers. Thesesequences replicate stably in pro and eukaryotes and facilitated theexpression of proteins containing up to 300 glutamines or leucines. Trans fections of cultured mammalian cells show that proteins containing(Gln)300 and (Leu)300 repeats are toxic and display a high propensity foraggregation with Leu repeats producing a significantly increased toxicitycompared to Gln repeats. In addition various cellular transcription factorsco aggregate in these aggregates including the transcriptional co activa tors CBP and p300. We are currently studying the effects of the expressionof proteins containing single amino acid repeats in mammalian cells usingDNA chip and micro array technology. These studies should provideinsight in the cellular changes and the toxic effects of these aggregation prone proteins. ,2001

Recently we identified missense mutations ina novel fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) as the cause for ADHR. Patientswith ADHR display many clinical and laboratory characteristics that areobserved in patients with oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia(OHO). OHO is thought to arise by the secretion of a phosphate wastingfactor. We therefore investigated whether FGF23 is a secreted factor.

907, erlangen.dePrimary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glau coma and between 1 and 2 % of the population over age 40 is affected by this disease. Recently mutations in the trabecular meshwork inducible glu cocorticoid response (TIGR) gene also known as myocilin (MYOC) wereidentified for juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG). TIGR/MYOC is locat ed on human chromosome 1q23 24 and his function remains unknown. Asprerequisite for TIGR expression analysis three different green fluorescentproteins have been transfected into S2 insect cells. First the GFP codingregion was cleaved from pQBI25 and subcloned into the expression/selec tion plasmid. The assay uses the expression/selection vector pIB/V5 His. The highest concentrations of blasticidin (10g/ml) resulted in good andcontamination free growth of the cell culture. In this analysis the GFPderived from the pQBI25 vector revealed the highest transfection efficien cy accompanied by bright fluorescence. Analysis of BFP proteins howev er was hampered by the blue fluorescence of S2 cells themselves. In anal ogy to experiments performed with Myelin Protein Zero GFP Fusions inthis system we perform currently expression analysis of TIGR GFP fusionproteins. This will allow to determine the correct ATG codon as well asintracellular localization and a postulated secretion of the protein. ,2001
908,The spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) region on chromosome 5q13 containsan inverted 500 kb duplication and deleterious mutations in one of the sur vival motor neuron (SMN) genes namely SMN1 cause this common lethalchildhood neuropathy. The major difference between SMN1 and SMN2 isa single nucleotide that in SMN2 favors the exclusion of exon 7. SMAseverity parallels the amount of available full length SMN. We havedemonstrated that SMN gene duplication occurred >5 Mya in a commonancestor of humans and chimpanzees however SMN2 first appeared inHomo sapiens indicating that SMN1 is the ancestral gene. RNA and pro tein data suggest both temporal and spatial regulation of SMN production. We have used two approaches to identify potential cis elements involvedin SMN gene regulation. First we performed an interspecies sequencecomparison to generate a percent identity plot. PipMaker detected 3 majorclusters of highly conserved (60 70%) DNA stretches between the mouseand human SMN genes. These segments also harbored a number of puta tive binding sites for known transcription factors. In addition the region sur rounding exon 7 shared 77% identity. Second functional assays ofenhancer/silencer activity of the entire 14 kb mouse Smn gene revealedtwo DNA segments that affected the promoter activity of a CAT reportergene. One of these mapped to a region of 70% interspecies sequenceidentity. This high degree of sequence conservation was lacking in the sec ond element. In conclusion we have identified two elements potentiallyinvolved in transcriptional regulation of SMN gene expression. This workcould provide some clues towards manipulating SMN2 gene expression topotentially treat SMA. Funded by HSCF and MRC. ,2001
909,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a commonhereditary disease characterized by the progressive development of fluid filled cysts in renal tubuli leading to chronic renal failure. To date two pro teins have been identified to be involved in ADPKD polycystin 1 and poly cystin 2. These proteins are thought to function in signal transduction cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell adhesion and probably act in a com mon cellular pathway as well as independently of eachother. Antibodiesgenerated against both proteins have been used to study expression in tis sues and in cultured epithelial cells. We also analyzed MDCK cells a renalepithelial cell line transfected with a full length Polycystin 2 enhancedgreen fluorescent protein (Pol2 EGFP) fusion protein construct. Pol2 EGFP overexpressing cells showed mainly diffuse cytoplasmic expression consistent with endoplasmic reticulum/pre middle Golgi localization report ed by Cai et al. (JBC Oct 1999). Expression of Pol2 EGFP in the plasmamembrane was detected only in a small subset of cells. Staining with poly clonal antibodies raised against polycystin 2 overlapped with Pol2 EGFPexpression which indicates that these antibodies recognize polycystin 2.Staining with antibodies raised against polycystin 1 partially overlapped inthe cytoplasm which generally paralleled intensity of Pol2 EGFP expres sion. In the plasma membrane polycystin 1 co localizes with desmosomesand possible colocalization with polycystin 2 was observed in the subset of250 Posters: Gene Structure and Functioncells in which Pol2 EGFP was expressed at the plasma membrane. These results suggest cotransport of these proteins from the cytoplasm to theplasma membrane and that Polycystin 1 and 2 may interact and stabilizeeachother in a cell cycle or transcription/translation dependent manner. ,2001
910,The human TSPY (testis specific protein Y encoded) is organized as arepetitive gene family of 30 to 60 copies with ist bulk mapping to yp. TSPYcodes for a testis specific expressed m RNA transkripts and could also bedetected on Western blots as a 33/38kD protein depending on its degreeof phosphorylation. By immunohistostaining TSPY was detected in sper matogonia and to a lesser extent in primary spermatocytes suggesting arole in spermatogenesis. Nevertheless the precise function of TSPYremains unknown. In contrast to human TSPY mouse tspy appears to bea single copy pseudogene. To better understanding of TSPY regulation wedetermined whether human TSPY can be correctly transcribed and splicedin a mouse spermatogonia cell line (GC 1).After transfection of these cellswith a construct including the entire gene and the putative promoter ofhuman TSPY we could show that the hTSPY cDNA is spliced according tothe major pattern known from in vivo studies. This cellular model enabledus to investigate the human TSPY promoter region more precisely. Wehave cloned different reduced promoter fragments into a luciferase vector(pGL3) (Promega) and tested their transcriptional activities in the GC 1spermatogonia cell line. The distinct promoter regions showed differenttranscriptional activities enabling us to determine length and functionaldomains of the TSPY promoter. ,2001
911, ulm.deNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disor ders in human with a prevalence of about 1 in 3500 individuals. The 8.5 kbcoding sequence of the NF1 gene is followed by an unusually long 3ÃÂ« untranslated region (3.5 kb) which is highly conserved between mouse andhuman. 3ÃÂ«UTRs are known to influence the fate of mRNAs in several ways including intracellular localisation control of its stability and regulation oftranslation efficiency. These functions are often mediated by proteins bind ing to regulatory sequences within the 3ÃÂ«UTRs. Our group searched forprotein binding sites within the NF1 3ÃÂ«UTR and defines the interacting pro teins. Up to now we were able to identify five protein binding regionstermed PBR1 5 in the NF1 3ÃÂ«UTR. Two of them were studied in moredetail. PBR1 binds three different proteins with estimated molecularweights of 40 kDa 68 kDa and 96 kDa. Cross link reactions demonstratedthat the protein interacting with NF1 PBR5 has an approximate molecularweight of 48 kDa. In order to identify the respective proteins we establisheda new screening method using high density protein expression filters fromthe RZPD (Resource Center German Human Genome Project). The filterscontain 37200 clones expressing high levels of the protein repertoire ofhuman fetal brain. After incubation of the filters with radiolabelled PBR1 or5 RNA we obtained 8 positive clones interacting specifically with one of thetwo PBRs. The identification and verification of the putative RNA bindingproteins are on the way. ,2001
912," mainz.deThe human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) plays a key role in thesecretion of many clinically important drugs (e.g.antiviral drugs) in theproximal tubule cells of the kidney. In a PCR based approach we isolateda genomic hOAT1 PAC clone and determined the exon intron structure ofthe gene. hOAT1 consists of 10 exons ranging from 104 to 369 bp. RT PCR analysis on human kidney samples led to the detection of two newsplice variants (hOAT1 3 and hOAT1 4) showing a 132 bp inframe dele tion of the ORF as part of exon 9. Using Fluorescence in situ hybridizationand radiation hybrid panels we mapped the hOAT1 gene to chromosome11q13.1 q13.2. In order to further elucidate its function and involvement inregulatory processes expression experiments were performed with thehuman and the rabbit orthologue (rbOAT1). Transcription of the gene wasnot only observed in kidney and liver but also in non secreting tissues likemuscle and eye. In situ hybridization of the rabbit retina with the renalrbOAT1 as a probe revealed positive signals in the endothelium of innerblood vessels the ganglion cells and several neurons in the bipolar celllayer. Since this is the first description of an organic anion transporter inneuron cells it is tempting to speculate about hOAT1 playing a role intransport processes of neurotransmitter metabolites in the visual system.

913, ulm.deThe Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene is located on chromosome17q11.2 in a 1.5 Mb region which is flanked by two copies of a long rangerepeated sequences. Approximately 10% of NF1 patients carry a deletionof the entire region between the repeats. Most of these patients are moreseverely affected and suffer from learning disabilities as well as mentalretardation besides other symptoms the hallmarks of the NF1 phenotype. In order to identify the genes responsible for this specific phenotype westarted a search for genes located in the deleted region which areexpressed in brain. RT PCR experiments showed that nine of twelve ESTslocated in the critical region are expressed in human brain. We character ized the gene flanking the NF1 gene in 3 direction in more detail termedFHN3 (flanking the human NF1 gene in 3 direction). The FHN3 gene spans105 kb and comprises 18 exons. Alternative splicing and usage of multiplepolyA sites were found by analysing a panel of fetal tissue specific cDNAsby RT PCR. Northern Blot hybridisation experiments with different humanadult tissues revealed the occurrence of a brain specific 9.5 kb mRNA inaddition to the 3.5 kb transcript which was also found in other tissues. Thededuced amino acid sequence of the FHN3 gene shows no homology toother known proteins or functional domains. The brain specific isoformresults from the usage of a downstream alternative polyA site while theprotein coding part of the transcript is not altered. ,2001
914, hamburg.deWe initiated a project which is aimed at the systematic identification andcharacterization of novel genes and regulatory pathways involved in thecomplex processes of cartilage/bone formation growth differentiation andhomeostasis. The goal is to generate a number of positional and function al candidate genes for inherited monogenic (skeletal dysplasias) as well asmultigenic disorders (osteoarthritis/osteoarthrosis and osteoporosis).Starting point of the project is a unique human fetal cartilage cDNA library. Sequencing of 400 randomly selected clones revealed that 62% of theclones showed sequence similarity to known genes (including collagentype II and osteonectin) 13% matched to known genomic sequences and15% to other ESTs in the databases. The remaining 4 5% of clonesshowed no match to known sequences and were considered as putativenovel cDNAs most likely representing cartilage specific transcripts. Thegeneration of 10.000 human ESTs is now in progress. So far 2000 ESTshave been generated and fifteen cDNAs that do not show any significantsimilarities to known genes are currently analysed in more detail. ThesecDNAs represent genes encoding transcription factors (one with a KRABdomain) putative transmembrane proteins as well as a protein with PHDdomains. For novel or very rare transcripts the chromosomal localisationas well as the expression pattern will be determined and full length cDNAwill be sequenced for a subset of transcripts (80 100). All sequences willbe subject to comprehensive bioinformatic analysis stored in a specialdatabase and will be used to generate DNA microarrays for expressionprofiling with a focus on human disorders. ,2001
915, hamburg.deWolf Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) is a complex and variable malformation252 Posters: Gene Structure and Functionsyndrome resulting from the absence of the distal segment of one chro mosome 4 short arm (4p16.3). Clinical and cytogenetic data indicate thatWHS is a contiguous gene syndrome with an undefined number of genescontributing to the phenotype. The WHS critical region (WHSCR) has beenconfined to a 165 kb gene rich region on chromosomal subband 4p16.3.Our studies aim at the identification of all genes and regulatory regions inthe WHSCR (including flanking regions) as well as the functional charac terization of the gene products in order to identify those genes that areinvolved in the phenotype. We and others have previously identified novel genes in the WHSCR andflanking region using exon trapping and computer based analysis of thisregion. Here we report the reinvestigation of the WHSCR using compara tive sequencing of the corresponding chromosomal region in the mousegenome (chromosome 5) and interspecies sequence comparison to iden tify evolutionary conserved and therefore functionally importantsequences. Besides the known genes LETM1 WHSC1 WHSC2 POL4P we identified additional putative transcribed sequences which may repre sent alternatively spliced exons or additional genes. One of these tran scripts shows specific expression in several adult and fetal organs affect ed in WHS patients. Further activities will concentrate on the functionalanalysis of the transcribed sequences and on conserved non codingregions. On the basis of these data we present a novel complete transcriptmap of these region which is complemented by functional studies on someof the putative gene products. ,2001

PLXNB3 the gene encoding plexin B3 maps to Xq28 and may be considered as candidate gene for X linked neurological disorders including mental retardation. We isolated andcharacterized full length (6142 bp ) PLXNB3 cDNA by screening fetal brain cDNA library and performing 5 RACE PCR. Computer analysis predictedan ORF for a 1910 amino acid transmembrane protein containing alldomains characteristic for plexins with closest homology to plexin B1/SEP. The transcribed region spans more then 15 kb and contains a 5 noncod ing and 35 coding exons. Multiple tissue northern blot analysis revealed6.7 and 8.6 kb transcripts and suggested a predominant expression inhuman brain. In situ hybridization showed complex and changing expres sion patterns during mouse embryonic development. In adult human CNSneuronal expression was observed in cortex mesencephalon pons medulla oblongata and spinal cord. Plexin B3 was also highly expressedin adult mouse ovary and testis. Two different specific rabbit anti humanplexin B3 antisera were obtained by immunization of animals witholigopeptides derived from extracellular plexin B3 domains. By using theseantisera and a phosphotyrosine specific antibody western blot analysis ofvarious protein fractions of COS7 cells transfected with human cDNA con taining the complete ORF showed that plexin B3 is a tyrosine phosphory lated transmembrane monomeric ~230 kDa glycoprotein. Western blottingalso revealed a plexin B3 immunoreactive aberrant band in human glioma suggesting tumor associated expression of PLXNB3 with reduced glyco sylation of its protein.

917,Detection of cytoplasmic mRNAs by in situ hybridization has been difficultin a number of instances on single cell level particularly because of the dif fuse distribution of transcripts and thus the low density of signals. Wehave therefore examined the possibility of detecting RNA transcripts in thenucleus where a higher concentration of target molecules and thus high er signal intensity might be expected. In search of a model system provid ing optimum controls we have selected the Ewing tumor cell line SK N MCin which transcription of a p53 inducible gene is controlled by a recombi nant p53 protein. This system offers a very good control for the specificityof hybridization reactions because the same cell line can be used under identical experimental conditions as positive and negative control depend ing upon the presence or absence of p53 induction. Northern blot analysiswas used to confirm the presence of the target RNA in nuclear samplesderived from induced cells. For mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization(RNA FISH) PCR generated digoxigenin labeled probes were used. Thismethod permitted detection of the expected RNA transcripts in the nucle us as distinct spots and track like structures depending on the time ofinduction which were absent in the negative controls. Accumulation of thetranscripts at site of transcription was visualized by combined DNA andRNA FISH. Specific detection of RNA transcripts in the nucleus may there fore provide a possible alternative to cytoplasmic hybridization in someinstances. We are currently testing the possibility of the detection of otherexpressed genes. ,2001
918,Mutation in the mitochondrial DNA occurs at a high rate and mtDNA muta tions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Sequence polymorphismsin the mtDNA have been also suggested to be associated with either thegeneration or the expression of other mtDNA or nDNA mutations. Notablein this context are those in the D loop control region in particular the T toC sequence variant (T16189C) between nt16184 and 16193 which havebeen implicated as a predisposing factor for several diseases includingdiabetes mellitus. Elucidation of factors responsible for errors in mtDNAreplication is important in our understanding of the generation of mtDNAmutations (pathological and normal variants). The mtDNA genome con tains several homopolymeric tracts ranging from five to twelve cytosines. Above the length of six the tracts started to show unstability as reflected bythe presence of length heteroplasmy indicating slip replication. ThemtDNA T16189C variant is associated with the formation of poly C of var ious lengths ranging from five to 12 and thus providing an excellent sys tem to study the generation of the length heteroplasmy and its determiningfactor(s). We have thus studied the genetic characteristics of this mtDNAregion taking advantage of our extensive collection of cell lines and vari ous tissue samples obtained at autopsies. In this communication we pres ent evidence to show that 1. The pattern of length heteroplasmy is gener ated de novo during mitochondrial biogenesis as shown (a) after severemtDNA copy number reduction by exposing cultured fibroblast cells toethidium bromide and repopulation of the cells following its removal (b) insingle cell pick up experiment regardless of random segregation of othermtDNA mutation marker and (c) by the fact that the pattern is maintainedin different tissues of an individual obtained at autopsy. 2. The pattern oflength heteroplasmy is determined by both mitochondrial and nucleargenetic factors in that (a) for homopolymeric tracts of more than ninecytosines the pattern is maternally inherited and (b) for homopolymerictract of eight cytosines or less nuclear influence is dominant as demon strated in experiments involving the generation of cybrids. ,2001
919,Maturation at the primary RNA transcript of eukaryotic gene often involvesthe removal of unwanted internal segments and rejoining the remainingsegments. The fidelity of RNA splicing is dependent on the identity of thenucleotide sequences at exon/intron boundaries. It has been known thatdinucleotides of GT started and AG ended in an intron have a considerabledegree of conservation and to be functionally important in the splicingevent. Substitution of GT to any other nucleotide eventually leads to a mal function in RNA splicing processing. In this report we used transient trans fection of cloned CYP21 genome which contained the intron 2 mutation atthe splicing site from GT to AT into COS 1 cells and analyzed the RNA tran script by RT PCR. The results showed that skip at exon 3 occurred duringRNA processing when the splicing donor site changed from GT to AT. Theprominent splicing product was the transcript with whole exon 3 regionPosters: Gene Structure and Function 253skipped. Other minor RNA processing products appeared to contain some additional intron 2 sequences. Similar results were obtained when thesplicing donor site sequences were changed from GT to AT in human beta globin gene further emphasizing general consequence of the splicingdonor site mutation for RNA processing. ,2001
920,UBE4A is a novel ubiquitination factor actively involved in the multiubiqui tination chain assembly of target proteins in the proteasomal degradationprocess. E4 binds to the ubiquitin moieties of these conjugates and together with E1 E2 and E3 enzymes drives the multiubiquitin chainassembly yielding long chains. E4A is the human homologue of the yeastUFD2 also involved in the stress tolerance. Recently a chimeric proteinUfd2/D4Cole1e was identified in mouse and found associated to slow Wal lerian degeneration (Wlds) a disease characterised by axon death atperipheral and central level. We characterised a full length cDNA of 6060bps of the human UFD2/UBE4A corresponding to the KIAA0126 cDNAdeposited in GenBank. UFD2/UBE4A was mapped by FISH experimentson the human chromosome region 11q23.3. Northern blots analysis usingadult tissues showed that this gene is expressed at high levels as a singleband of 7.5 Kb in the heart skeletal muscle kidney and to discrete levelsin the brain liver and placenta. A faint band was evident in colon thymus spleen small intestine lung and peripheral blood leukocytes. A Northernblot containing fetal tissues confirmed the adult results. Because of theimportance in ubiquitin pathway and its involvement in neuronal degener ation of this protein we suggest that UBE4A can be considered a candi date for neurodegenerative diseases mapping on chromosome 11q. ,2001
921,Beta globin locus control region (LCR) is the first identified examples of adominant control region located at a distance of many kilobases from thestructural genes. It has very strong enhancer activity extending over theentire locus. b LCR consists of four strong erythroid specific DNase hyper sensitive sites (5 HS 1 2 3 and 4). Most of the LCR activity is associat ed with 5 HS 2 3 and 4. Hypersensitive site 3 (HS 3) of the b LCR hasbeen implicated as an important regulator of the b like globin genes. Toinvestigate the polymorphisms at HS 3 of the human b LCR both b tha lassemia patients and control group were initially amplified by PCR andthen amplified products were screened for changes at HS 3 using directDNA sequencing technique. According to our results guanine deletion of7415 position at the HS 3 was observed in a b thalassemia major patient. This segment including deletion of 7415 position is the core region of HS 3 which consists of binding sites for ubiquitous and erythroid specific reg ulatory factors such as GATA 1 YY1 and CSBP 2 transcription factors. These transcription factors play an important role in b globin gene switch ing. To investigate whether there is any transcription factors bound thisregion we will aim to determine the interaction between these trans actingfactors and DNA using bandshift assay in the future studies. ,2001
922,TNF produced by fat cells in obese animals induces resistance to insulinthrough mechanisms that have not been completely identified. In NIH 3T3cells TNF inhibits insulin promoted phosphorylation of IRS 1 an adaptorprotein that links the insulin receptor to signaling pathways that promoteinsulin action and activates the Akt serine threonine kinase through theintermediacy of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI 3 kinase). Exposure toTNF was not required to induce insulin resitance in NIH 3T3 cells stablyexpressing constitutively active Akt. In insulin sensitive myotubes TNFactivated Akt and inhibited insulin promoted phosphorylation of IRS 1. Thiseffect and the capacity of TNF to impair insulin induced glucose uptakeinto myotubes was reversed by rapamycin an inhibitor of the mammaliantarget of rapamycin (mTOR) a downstream target of Akt which immuno precipitated with and phosphorylated IRS 1. TNF also inhibited insulin induced glucose transport in myotubes and rapamycin reversed this effect. Treatment of embryonic kidney 293 cells with TNF also impaired insulin promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1 and this was blocked by tran sitent expression of kinase that Akt. Transient expression of PTEN atumour suppressor which can dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol(3 4 5) triphosphate and activator of PI 3 kinase also blocked the abilityof TNF to inhibit insulin induced phosphation of IRS 1 in 293 cells. ThusTNF can promote insulin resistance by activation of a PI 3 kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway and this capacity is antagonized by PTEN. ,2001
923,Ubiquitin specific processes are essential in regulation of some apoptoticpathways. Spontaneous apoptosis observed in T cells from DiGeorgepatients may be at least in part responsible for T cell deficiency in DiGe orge syndrome. UFD1L a gene mapping in the typically deleted region forDiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes encodes for the human homo logue of yeast Ufd1 protein an ubiquitin dependent enzyme that takes partin a degradation pathway of ubiquitin fused substrates. Although the bio chemical role of UFD1L in mammals is still unknown it is presumable anactive role in degradation processes mediated by ubiquitin also in humancells. We have analysed the in vivo cellular localization of UFD1L bymeans its cloning in an eukaryotic GFP expression vector and then weused this chimaeric vector to analize the possible role of UFD1L protein inthe regulation of programmed cell death triggered from Fas receptor(CD95/APO 1). NIH3T3 and Cos 1 cell lines were transfected with theUFD1L GFP fusion construct and with the GFP vector alone as a control. Both cell lines expressed UFD1L in the cytoplasm with a particular con centration around the nuclear envelope. UFD1L overexpression was per formed in human T lymphoma HuT78 cells. In this condition no anti apop totic effect was observed upon Fas and ceramide stimulation thus exclud ing a role in the specific pathway of this death receptor. Our results indi cate that UFD1L is a cytoplasmatic protein particularly abundant aroundthe nucleus and that it is not involved in the Fas and ceramide specificapoptosis pathways. Nevertheless further overexpression analysis involv ing other apoptotic stimuli and accumulation/degradation of key signalingproteins may provide elucidation of the possible pathways regulated byUFD1L.

924,"In order to assess the copy number of a simple viral promoter/GFP cDNAexpression cassette required for visible transient expression we microin jected pEGFP plasmid into the nucleus of the human immortalized epithe lial cell line 16HBE the tumor cell line HT1080 and primary human fibrob lasts. pEGFP plasmid was diluted down from approximately 100 000copies to 1 copy per injection volume (1 pl) in a DNA solution containingconstant amounts of non expressing plasmid DNA. Independently of thecell line used at least 100 1000 copies were required to detect green cellsunder the microscope. Between 100 and 10 000 copies the intensity wassubstantially increased. Above 10 000 copies no additional increase wasdetected. With higher copy numbers only the intensity was increased andnot the number of expressing cells since all dilutions from 100 to 100 000copies led to approximately 60 80% surviving and expressing cells. Withina copy number group most cells were found to show relatively equal inten sity however a 5 10 % fraction of cells showed extremely high intensityindependent of the injected copy number indicating the existence of occa sional circumstances activating expression in the order of 1000 fold inthose cells. We conclude that single copies of simple gene markers mightnot be suitable to readily detect the presence of transfected DNA. Data willbe presented narrowing down the circumstances leading to the dramaticexpression increase. 254 Posters: Gene Structure and FunctionP0796.

So far separation based applications have been introduced addressingDNA RNA and proteins. The compact benchtop system is capable oftwo color fluorescence detection and runs disposable microfluidic glasschips. The novel applications presented here are based on the controlledmovement of cells by pressure driven flow inside networks of microchan nels. Cells are hydrodynamically focussed before passing the fluorescencedetector in single file. Each chip accommodates several samples. Dataacquisition is automated while analysis allows for user specific settings. Specific advantages of the instrument are the low number of cells requiredfor analysis and the ease of use. So far the technology has been used incell transfection and apoptosis detection. Transfection data were obtainedfrom cells expressing green fluorescent protein and from antibody stainedcells. Counterstaining cells by a DNA specific dye facilitated the accuratedetermination of transfection efficiency. For an apoptosis related parame ter exposition of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer cell membrane leafletwas studied. Biotinylated AnnexinV was bound to externalized PS in camp tothecin treated cells and labeled by Cy5 avidin. Calcein staining was usedto differentiate live and apoptotic cells from dead cells. Results obtainedwith the microfluidic chips showed good correlation with data obtainedusing a standard flow cytometer. The simple use and the low cell con sumption of the microfluidic approach make the technique an ideal add onfor all cell based procedures. Further applications of this simple cell analy sis approach are under development. ",2001
925,LHON is a maternally inherited disorder resulting in subacute visual loss. It is associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). About 15%of the families are heteroplasmic. Molecular diagnosis of LHON is usuallymade by means of mtDNA analysis in blood DNA since the actual targettissues (optic nerve retina) are not available for examination. According togenealogical data the general risk for optic atrophy in homoplasmic indi viduals is about 30 50% in males and 5 15% in females. However genet ic counseling in LHON is extremely difficult. We cannot detect the personsat risk for optic atrophy even in homoplasmic families since all individualswith homoplasmic mutations do not express the disease. In heteroplasmicfamilies the situation is even more complex. The offspring of a heteroplas mic mother can have dramatically different levels of heteroplasmy. Fur thermore the amount of mutant mtDNA may considerably vary betweenthe tissues of the same individual and therefore blood is not necessarilyindicative of the mutation load in other tissues. We describe a family wherethe mother has less than 1% of mutant mtDNA and yet she has transmit ted a considerable amount of mutant mtDNA to her son. In his tissues theproportion of mutant mtDNA varies from 50% in blood up to 86% in othertissues. Affected heteroplasmic individuals usually have more than 70% ofmutant mtDNA in blood. However the son with only 50% of mutant mtDNAin blood is severely affected. His sister has 0% of mutant mtDNA in herblood and no risk for optic atrophy. However we cannot exclude a theo retical risk that she may transmit the disease to her offspring. ,2001
926,Having no effective treatment as yet Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy(DMD) can be fought only by means of prevention. The aim of the presentstudy was to assess the impact of genetic counseling in Romanian familiesaffected by DMD. A total of 37 families having 47 offsprings diagnosed withDMD between 1996 and 1999 were interviewed and asked to fill out aquestionnaire consisting of multiple choice and open ended questions. Thedata we recorded was structured into several categories general under standing of the disease and of its hereditary nature awareness of risk infamily planning genetic counseling history family pedigree. Some resultswere then compared with each patient s hospital records. Twenty two fam ilies (59%) perceived their offspring s malady as an accident with little riskof reoccurrence. Only two (5.4%) admitted a family history of DMD sug gesting either an unusually high frequency of de novo mutations or morelikely a poor knowlege of the disease. After the diagnosis was settled 16families (43%) planned to (and nine did) conceive another baby. Althoughsome acknowledged it the risk was seriously underestimated and gener ally not linked to the mother s serum creatine kinase levels. Our data sug gests that the beliefs projects and decisions of the families affected byDMD suffered little scientifically based influence. We consider the low levelof medical education in the general population together with the lack of aspecific genetic counseling program as being the leading causes for thissituation as well as the main issues that have to be corrected. ,2001
927,Despite advances in the field of genetics avoidance of many conditionsstill relies on screening prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy incase of an affected fetus. Attitudes towards such prevention techniquesare influenced by many variables including at least to a certain extent theattitudes of health professionals. Most of the studies have been conductedin the Western world. Therefore to assess attitudes in a Middle Easternsociety we have sent questionnaires concerning different genetic condi tions to geneticists family doctors pediatricians and obstetricians affiliat ed to one of the major medical centers in Lebanon. The questionnaireswere based on similar published questionnaires and responses measuredaccording to a similar scoring system. A total of 43 questionnaires weresent so far and responses received from 31 (72%). Generally speaking obstetricians seemed to be most favorable towards prenatal diagnosis andtermination of pregnancy both for medical and social conditions. Theywere followed by geneticists then family physicians while the least favor able were pediatricians. A wide range of responses were noticed withineach group and there was noted variability for particular questions. Therewas no clear correlation between response and sex age or religious affili ation. ,2001
928,We have studied various psychosocial aspects of genetic counseling inIndian milieu by analyzing questionaires filled by consultands and parentsof patients with genetic disorders one on the first visit to genetic clinic andanother after genetic counseling session. Multiple questions were used tojudge the expectations anxiety level change of decision and satisfactionafter genetic counseling. The analysis showed that most of the patientsand parents came with the expectation of diagnosis and treatment. Only 30out of 83 came primarily for diagnosis and information about risk of recur rence and other aspects of the disease. There was no change in the repro ductive decision in 74 of 83 consultands after genetic counseling while itchanged in 5 and 4 remained undecided even after genetic counseling. Presence or absence of normal live children and availability of prenataldiagnosis were the major factors affecting reproductive decision. 91% ofthose who decided against having more children had previous one or morenormal children while 67% of those who decided to plan for next child didnot have any live normal child. Perceived severity of risk of recurrence didnot appear to affect the reproductive decision. Though most of the consul tands were satisfied with the genetic counseling there was decrease in theanxiety in 35 of 83 persons while anxiety increased in 22 of 83. The genet ic counseling was nondirective in all cases but all of the parents thoughthat the counsellor should have advised them about the decision to betaken. ,2001
929,Now that the precise genetic basis of some diseases has been determined new diagnostic possibilities (tests) have emerged. While the psychosocialproblems related to genetic testing are being explored little attention hasbeen paid to date to the underlying linguistic aspects of these psychoso cial issues. Indeed information is given in language and the processing ofinformation occurs in language. The analysis of this linguistic level is fun damental to the understanding of the psychosocial problems arising fromtesting. In a qualitative pilot study 10 counselling sessions (with 4 differentcounsellors) on genetic testing considerations in breast cancer patientswere audiotaped transcribed to the standards of discourse analysis andsubsequently analysed linguistically. Testing for breast ovarian cancer sus ceptibility was chosen as an example of problematic testing concerning itsbenefits. Results In the problem presentation at the beginning of thecounselling sessions counsellees tended to have clear cut expectationsabout clear cut benefits of testing. The linguistic analysis reveals how new chunks of knowledge and their assessment by professionals are gradu ally processed and integrated (or not) in the counsellees knowledge struc tures. By the end of counselling in most cases the benefits of testing wereseen by the counsellees as more problematic than at the beginning ofcounselling thus making decision taking extremely difficult. The nature ofthe dilemma concerning BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing are revealed and dif ferentiated by the linguistic analysis. Conclusions for the practice of genet ic counselling are drawn. ,2001
930, u.ac.jpAlthough genetic counseling is fundamental before and after the genetictesting there is no official system for genetic counseling in Japan. We pro pose the team approach to genetic counseling. Shinshu University Hospi tal established a division of clinical and molecular genetics as one of itscentral service departments in 1996. It was officially approved by Ministryof Education in 2000. Our division is composed of several MDs from thedepartments of neurology endocrinology pediatrics oncology laboratorymedicine and medical genetics a clinical psychologist and a geneticnurse. Persons who seek genetic counseling or genetic testing visit ourclinic usually twice or more. At the first visit a staff member collects com plete information including family history correct diagnosis and examina tion results and he clarifies the client s request. We have a staff meetingonce a week to discuss each case for providing the next suitable counsel ing and we discuss the ethical legal and social issues (ELSI). At the sec ond visit genetic counseling is provided by an MD specialist and a clinicalpsychologist or a genetic nurse. Information of genetics or genetic testingis explained by an MD specialist and psychological support is offered by aclinical psychologist or genetic nurse. Three hundred and eleven clientsvisited the clinic from May 1996 to March 2000 170 for birth defects 37 forobstetric problems 47 for familial cancers 29 for neurological disordersand 28 for other reasons. Regarding familial cancer we performed genet ic testing in 44 cases including familial adenomatous polyposis multipleendocrine neoplasia type 1 and 2 familial breast cancer von Hippel Lin dau disease and Li Fraumeni syndrome. We hope our approach willbecome familiar to other hospitals and genetic services in Japan will con sequently be improved. ,2001
931,Genetic counselling and presymptomatic genetic testing in myotonic dys trophy have to take into consideration the extreme variability in range ofseverity and age at onset due to the instability of the mutation. So far thereis no specific model for presymptomatic testing in Myotonic dystrophy asfor Huntington s disease or familial cancers. In this survey we retrospec tively analysed the practice at the Institute of Medical Genetics Cardiff. Since the availability of direct mutation analysis for myotonic dystrophy in1992 clinical geneticists in Wales have undertaken 72 presymptomaticinvestigations. Six different approaches were found. The most commonone (n=46) was to take the blood sample at the first counselling session. Atwo step approach as proposed for Huntington s disease was practiced inonly 7 cases it was offered but rejected by the applicants in two furthercases. Factors which influenced on the choice of the counselling approachwere mainly age clinical assessment at the time of testing familiarity withthe disorder family dynamic the proband s perception of symptoms andtime pressure. This survey illustrated by specific cases should provide thestarting point for further more systematic study as well as giving a generalframework that may be useful for those involved with presymptomatic test ing for this important and exceptionally variable condition. ,2001
932,A specialised questionnaire containing 88 multiple choice questions onmedical and psychosocial aspects was sent to patients with Marfan Syn drome (MFS) from 7 European countries. The results were statisticallyanalysed with SPSS (9.0 for Windows). We present data from 857 individ uals on the quality of life and the psychosocial well being as experiencedby persons affected by MFS. A scoring system was established to assessthe objective severity of the condition in each individual. The subjectiveseverity that stands for the patients own perception of their condition wasalso questioned. We compared the results with an objective coping scorebased on questions relating to the psychosocial adjustment. The datashow that MFS represents a significant burden on many aspects of dailylife but that most individuals are coping effectively with the disorder. Thelevel of coping and the quality of life is determined by the subjective ratherthan by the objective severity. This is illustrated by the fact that the sub jective attitude towards the condition significantly influences the attitudetowards professional activities relationships and reproductive options. Many individuals have difficulties discussing problems associated with theMFS. It remains important to stimulate the support of family friends andpatient support groups since social isolation negatively correlates withdepression and anxiety. Professional support must pay extra attention tothe threat of social isolation. We conclude that creating a positive frame ofreference is a very important element for their psychosocial well being. ,2001
933,To evaluate the genetic service in antenatal care and counseling providedin Taiwan we conducted a nationwide study among women having chil dren with chromosomal abnormalities. Interviewing with semi structuredquestionnaire were conducted by trained counselors. Patient informationwas recruited from registrations of cytogenetic laboratories located in dif ferent regions of the island. In order to obtain the most recent data and pro vided counseling for most needed population only live births born fromJanuary 1 1998 till October 31 1999 were included in this study. A amonga total of 328 cases with chromosomal abnormalities obtained from 17cytogenetic laboratories 134 agreed to participate in the interview. 98% ofmothers received antenatal care and 69% of them received maternalserum screening with triple markers and with results within low risk range. Although in Taiwan over 60% of mothers with advanced age receivedamniocentesis there were 72% of them in this study group that did notreceive prenatal diagnosis. In addition we found that although maternalserum screening is performed popularly in antenatal care in Taiwan genet ic information is not provided adequately. These inadequacy in counseling raise confusion and unnecessary arguments when a child with chromoso mal abnormalities was born.

ES allows to perform more precise analysis and prognosis for each individualpatient according to his peculiarities lifestyle factors anamnestic and clin ical data. Genetic program includes HLA typing and predictive genetic test ing where 54 main metabolic and predisposition genes are included up todate. Special goal of ES genetic program is education and presentation ofgenetically based individual approach in modern medicine. Interpretationand all explanations in genetics are written in flexible and interactive man ner with the other chapters of ES. Moreover so called Ã\x99 3 dimentional prin ciple ÃÂ¨ is applied for all parts of ES including genetics first brief resultinterpretation is followed by the second detailed explanation confirmed bythe references (3d step). Other major goals of ES are 1) ES structure which allows to add regularly new information and methodologies accord ing to the latest achievements 2) applied research and possibility to per form epidemiological studies based on the ES data bank. In conclusion ESprovides a physician with explanations clinicobiological interpretations andadvice which helps to obtain a global vision of the patient s status. It alsoopens new opportunities for statistical analyses and mathematic modellingfor investigation of possible new trends in different populations due to envi ronment gene interactions. ,2001
935,In Hereditary Breast/Ovarian and Colon cancer families the probability topass on mutated genes to offspring is a relevant knowledge issue to helppatients to understand the reason for family disclosure of genetic risk. Thisfactor could be considered as one indicator of informed choice. The objec tive of this study was to investigate the baseline level of knowledge according to the type of cancer and the gender of the gene carrier. Anongoing prospective cohort survey (2000 2001) includes all patientsattending at one cancer genetic clinics in France following the analysis ofa first DNA sample (BRCA1/2 MLH1/MSH2). Face to face interviews werecarried out before a 2nd genetic consultation aiming to confirm both thedecision to be tested and the results on a 2nd DNA sample. Preliminaryresults were analysed in December 2000 (N=67 mean age 47 SD=12 94% women 72% cancer affected). Knowledge of the transmission of abreast/ovarian cancer gene to children when the mother is gene carrier was correct in 34% and when the father is carrier in only 10% (p<0.001).In contrast in the case of a colon cancer gene the answers were correctin 25% and did not vary whether mother or father were considered as car riers (NS). These results suggest that for sex related diseases inherited asan autosomal dominant trait such as breast/ovarian cancer understand ing of risk transmission is particularly confusing. In this respect geneticistsshould be aware of the possible impact of this mis representation in thescreening of male and their offspring. ,2001
936,Posters: Genetic Counseling and Genetic Education 257Thrombophilia is a common inherited/multifactorial predisposition for venous thromboembolic incidents (estimated 10 15% in the Greek popula tion) caused by inborn hypercoagulation of the blood. When a person sgenetic predispodition is known preventive anticoagulant therapy mayprevent life threatening incidents. In the present study we assessedwhether genetic counseling combined with molecular testing for the twomost common thrombophilia mutations may increase prevention in healthyindex cases with a family history of idiopathic thrombosis. Two groups ofunrelated Greek individuals were tested. Group A consisted of 48 individu als (26 55 years old) who asked for genetic counseling for various rea sons and they had at least one first degree and one second degree rela tive with thromboembolic incidents (in brain heart lungs deep veins pla centa etc.).Group B consisted of 50 individuals (23 61 years old) whowere tested in frame of routine prognostic check up. Molecular investiga tion of blood cell DNA samples was performed with a combination of PCRand TaqI digestion analysis for thrombophilia mutations Leiden (G1691A)and G20210A in the genes of coagulation factors V and II(prothrombin) which display frequencies of 5% and 4.5% in Greek population respec tively.23 individuals of group A (48%) and only 5 individuals of group B(10%) were found to have at least one mutation. The observed frequenciescorrespond well to the expected respective risks of individuals with a par ent with an autosomal dominant disorder (group A) and individuals of thegeneral population(group B). We conclude that genetic counseling mayincrease five fold the prevention of thrombotic incidents in individuals witha family history of thrombophilia. ,2001
937,As we expand our knowledge of genetic disease through the HumanGenome Project and its potential benefit to prenatal diagnosis it is imper ative to explore the use of this information by all ethnic groups. Previousstudies have shown that African American (AA) women are less likely thanwomen of other ethnic groups to utilize prenatal diagnosis. We sought toexplore whether or not there is a difference in the uptake of prenatal test ing when access to genetic counseling services is equal. A 20 month ret rospective study was performed to address these differences. During thistime there were 486 AA and 977 non AA women referred due to anincreased risk of fetal aneuploidy based on maternal age ( >= 35) or a pos itive maternal serum screen (MSS). Demographic comparisons noted a dif ference in Metropolitan Detroit residency (86% AA vs. 28% non AA p<0.0001) and private insurance policy holders (27% AA vs. 61% non AA p<0.0001). AA women were significantly less likely than non AA women tochose prenatal testing following genetic counseling (36% AA vs. 62% non AA p<0.0001). This was consistent in both maternal age patients (38% AAvs. 54% non AA p<0.001) and MSS patients (35% AA vs. 47% non AA p=0.001). Further analyses will determine if certain demographic or cultur al variables influence the utilization of prenatal diagnostic procedures with in our study population. Preliminary findings from our study demonstrate aneed for additional investigations to uncover the inherent biases regardingprenatal diagnosis among specific ethnic groups. ,2001
938,Most counselling settings Ã¢\x80\x94 in education divorce mediation dispute reso lution etc Ã¢\x80\x94 are characterised by a climate of uncertainty management. Both professionals and clients see these encounters as Ã¢\x80\x98information andÃ¢\x80\x98advice exchange systems as they draw upon the descriptive and evalua tive functions of language. In the context of genetic counselling generally and for predictive testing in particular the issue of uncertainty assumesparticular significance in relation to delivery of genetic (risk) information. Almost everything that is said by the clinician has the potential to be inter preted by the client as being Ã¢\x80\x98suggestive . In this paper we approach thenotion of uncertainty (as separate from ambiguity vagueness and non directiveness) from a qualitative communication/discourse perspective. Based on detailed analysis of audio recorded transcribed data from Hunt ington s Disease and Breast Cancer clinics we focus on the nature androle of various discourse strategies such as use of hedging and dis claimers contrastive formulations display of mutually shared knowledgeetc. We argue that the interactional tensions are most evident when clientsorient towards resolving uncertainty in personal and categorical terms whereas the clinicians restrict themselves to their existing medical knowl edge base and their professional experience of families with similar genet ic disorders. The paper is based on an on going project titled Ã¢\x80\x98Communicative Framesin Counselling for Predictive Genetic Testing funded by The WellcomeTrust. ,2001

940,As this new century begins headlines about DNA catch our attentioneveryday and as the Human Genome Project approaches completion it iscritically important to bring science closer to society to have educationalprojects that focus on DNA and to stimulate discussions of the issuesinherent to the genetic era . Clearly fundamental concepts as citizenshipas well as important principles of ethics will be reshaped according to anew social order dictated by the introduction of this new technology in oursociety. In this sense the young person s education should open horizonsand prepare the young person for life considering all of the transformingstages that our society is already facing. Because a free democratic soci ety is not just a matter of having choices but of preparing the citizens to beable to understand these choices. For this reason we have developedDNA goes to school a pioneer educational project launched in 1999 in Riode Janeiro Brazil. The project was developed in order to provide an oppor tunity for high school students to have closer contact with DNA science. Itcombines hands on DNA experiments with a variety of open discussionsregarding different themes such as genetically modified food cloning TheHuman Genome Project and other activities dealing with DNA and the genetic era . During the first year of establishment more than 400 stu dents have attended the course. The complete course is a 12 hours classdivided into 4 different sections of 3 hours and is limited to a group of 16students. We have evaluated the course and 98% of the students pointedout that the course is adequate for their level of knowledge it has clarifiedimportant concepts and it has been a unique opportunity to have discus sions about different issues concerning the new genetic era. ,2001
941,A random sample survey of 3600 health professionals who are membersof 6 national professional organizations in the US showed that the majori ty of allied and counseling health professionals are providing genetic serv ices to at least some of their clients even though they have minimal edu cation in genetics. The study was carried out as part of the HumanGenome Education Model (HuGEM) Project of Georgetown UniversityMedical Center and the Genetic Alliance and funded by the National Insti tutes of Health National Human Genome Research Institute. The collabo rating associations in the 1998 study included the American Dietetic Asso ciation American Occupational Therapy Association American PhysicalTherapy Association American Psychological Association and NationalAssociation of Social Workers. At the time of the survey the membershipsof the six organizations totaled 570 000 with 330 909 members identifiedas direct service providers. Of the 1 958 (57%)responses received 70%have discussed the genetic component of presenting problems with atleast a few clients 29% have provided counseling about genetic concernswhile only 19% made referrals for genetic counseling and 15% havereferred for genetic testing. While the majority of respondents are provid ing genetic services few have high confidence in what they are doing. Nearly two thirds take family histories however only 1 in 4 is confidentabout eliciting genetic information as part of the history. Most social work ers (87%) and psychologists (79%) in the study provide counseling how ever only 26% and 29% respectively have high confidence in counselingclients making decisions about genetic testing. Although two thirds of thehealth professional s hold graduate degrees less than 21% have had oneor more courses in genetics 44% have had genetic content in course workand 33% have had no formal education in genetics. High confidence isrelated to amount of genetics education independent of overall education. For example 98% of psychologists have doctorates however their confi dence in providing genetic services is correlated with amount of geneticseducation on eight measures (p<.05). Nearly two thirds of respondentswant continuing education in genetics. Priority topics identified were 1)Role of genetics in common disorders such as stroke heart disease andcancers 2) Overview of human genetics 3) Identifying genetic resourcesfor clients 4) Helping clients cope with new genetic diagnoses 5) Geneticinformation and racial/ethnic concerns 6) New treatments 7) Privacy andconfidentaility issues and 8) Communicating genetic information to clients. The survey supports the need for incorporating genetics into the practiceand teaching of all health professionals. It will take a coordinated effortamong genetics professionals professional associations academic insti tutions and funding agencies to assure that health professionals receivethe genetics education needed to meet the increasing needs of clients withgenetic concerns. Questionnaires survey results and model curricula willbe available to participants. ,2001

943,The teaching of human genetics at this dawn of the twenty first centurymust include consideration of the ethical and moral implications of theinformation being presented. Advances in medical technology and under standing are rapidly communicated and assimilated so there no longerexists the luxury of detached dispassionate reflection upon what was oncethe incremental but slow progress of science. Geneticists and philosopher ethicians need to work more closely to understand the impact of geneticknowledge on the society and culture into which it is incorporated. The rev olution in the speed and trajectory of medical technology brought about bythe advent of molecular biology techniques necessitates a revolution in themanner in which discoveries are taught in the classroom. Medical geneticsmust be presented in concert with the ethical and moral implications of thatinformation because all students are conditioned by the ethical and moralculture in which they live and philosophical presuppositions must bebrought to light so that the effects of the rapidly changing scientific knowl edge base on people may be foreseen and rendered beneficial. We havedeveloped a course for upper level undergraduates entitled MedicalGenetics and Its Implications which presents a challenging curriculum ofadvanced scientific information along with a consideration of ethical theo ries by which to evaluate the impact of this knowledge on individuals fam ilies and societies. We believe that our course materials can be adaptedeasily and fruitfully for use in other undergraduate graduate and profes sional school courses. ,2001
944,The development of molecular genetics has created new possibilities forclinical applications sometimes for whole populations. Simultaneously human genetics has become a popular subject in the media which hasincreased public interest. In clinical practice it appears however that pub Posters: Genetic Counseling and Genetic Education 259lic understanding of these issues has not increased and misconceptions are common. In Finland after 9 years of basic education more than half ofthe students continue to upper secondary schools (gymnasiums). In thegymnasium curriculum there are two compulsory courses on biology andvoluntary extra courses among which a course on genetics is very popu lar. However the textbook used for this course is very theoretical and main ly concentrates on molecular genetics. To complement this book we cre ated material for a course of 12 lectures on clinical/practical aspects ofhuman genetics. The team consisted of a clinical geneticist (HK) a genet ic nurse (MS) three teachers of biology and two groups of students. Thematerial consisted of texts and exercises for students instructions forteachers and solutions for the excercises. Many of the exercises wereproblems on many levels mendelian calculations personal dilemmas andethical problems on the level of the community. We have also organizedtraining for teachers based on this material. The response of both teachersand students has been enthusiastic but the real impact of such anapproach to understanding of genetics will be difficult to assess. ,2001
945,Attitudes are determinant of educational process quality hence they mustbe included in its objectives. This proposal is a true change in Science Didactics paradigm. The scientific technological and social (STS)approach emphasizes the importance of the ethical aspects as well as thedevelopment of conscious opinion in the educational processes. Conse quently in a first stage we have investigated attitude components in a sam ple of students entering the medical career at the Faculty of Medicine National University of Rosario (Argentina). In order to evaluate the affec tive and behavioural components we have prepared validated and appliedan instrument used in social psychology (Lickert s scale) analysing Genet ics social image (GSI) teaching learning process (TLP) and sharedresponsibility (SR). The results show a favourable attitude global trend regarding Genetics and its advance [total mean 3.73/5 GSI 3.7/5 TLP 3.7/5 SR 3.8/5]. The cognitive component was assessed by means of aninstrument demanding the solution of different activities offered to the stu dents. Cognitive evaluation attained 34% of correctly resolved activities [x=5.29/15.5]. See Figure displaying results according scores. Thus it is clearthat the knowledge of the students in Genetics is poor this is a challeng ing goal to attain during the development of this first year of the career inwhich we are currently working. ,2001
946,Genetic tests become increasingly accessible. Possible benefits of testingfor susceptibility to chronic disease may be substantially outweighed byconfusion raised by test results. The concepts of sensitivity specificity andpositive predictive value of a test are all complex and therefore not neces sarily understandable to an uninitiated patient. On the other hand in orderto make informed decisions on participation in genetic screening programsand in prenatal diagnosis patients should be told about these concepts. Moreover several studies have shown that even physicians have a poorunderstanding of probabilities and the predictive value of test results. Gigerenzer and coworkers hypothesised that due to human evolutionarydevelopment mental algorithms were not designed for probabilities and aBayesian reasoning but for the understanding of natural frequencies. Theyshowed that the use of this latter kind of representation can serve as aneffective tool in inferring the predictive values of a test and to improve thecommunication of risks between physicians and patients as well. In orderto test their suggestions for genetic counselling four problems were pre sented to more than 200 of our fellow students (representatives of anupper middle class lay population) either as probabilities or as natural fre quencies (1) positive triple test and the risk of trisomy 21 (2) insulindependent diabetes mellitus and DR3/DR4 (3) breast cancer andBRCA1/BRCA2 (4) inheritance of familial polyposis and symptom freeageing. Participants received in a randomised order all four problems twopresented as probabilities and two as natural frequencies. They generallyranked the natural frequency questions as less difficult and yielded a sig nificant better understanding of the risk. The representation of complexconcepts in natural frequencies rather than in probabilities can improve theunderstanding of patients and of physicians ,2001
947,Considering the increasing number of people using the internet as ansource of knowledge about medical issues we analysed the information ofweb sites on Down Syndrome (DS). After a search for Down syndromewith the search engines Altavista and Yahoo (in German and in English) we examined medical and/or psycho social information of web sites withinthe first 100 hits yielded by each search engine. A predefined catalogue ofhealth related data was used for a ranking of web sites. Basic (required)and additional (facultative) information were evaluated separately Englishand German web sites were compared. The sample size was 324 hits (200English 124 German) of which only 77 (24%) were medical web sites. Among these were 34 relevant German web sites (27% of 124 hits) and 43relevant English web sites (22% of 200 hits). In both languages all levelsof information (poor/excellent) were found. Only 24% of the German web sites and 35% of the English web sites gave more than 50% of the basicmedical information. Looking at the additional information there were 1German and 5 English web sites communicating more than 50% of theexpected content. An impact of language and authorship (universities/per sonal homepage) on the substance could be established. English web sites contained more material than German s. Since many homepagesdon t cover and are not intended to present most of the required facts theusefulness of both the German and the English web sites as a source ofinformation on DS is limited. Careful work is essential to ensuring that theInternet takes shape in ways that support customers needs of health infor mation. However some examples show the potential of the internet although the possibilities to educate people about DS are not completelyrealised. ,2001
948,Over the last few decades there has been a gradual change in the patternof diseases in many western countries and genetic disorders have beenimportant causes of morbidity and mortality. In the present research 800patients coming to 3 genetic centers in Tehran (capital of Iran) were stud ied. The study focused on the prevalence of various kinds of congenitalmalformations and genetic diseases in Iranian Population. The effect of260 Posters: Genetic Counseling and Genetic Education STAKEHOLDERS STRATEGIES Employees Symposia Investigators Courses Ethics Committees Workshops Policymakers Meetings Regulatory Authorities Newsletters Patients Websites Public Videotapes Private Insurers University Faculty consanguinity and the kind of congenital malformations and genetic disor ders associated with consanguinity the present position of genetic coun seling facilities available in Iran and the extent of their utility the role ofeducation of the parents in prevention the spread of certain genetic disor ders and their association with the consanguineous marriages wasexplored. Analysis of data revealed that major disorders were Down s syn drome (22%) Primary Amenorrhoea (11%) {Psychomotor retardation(9.5%) Mental retardation(7.9%)and Turner Syndrome (5.1%). 43.6 % ofthe patients were born to the consanguineous parents out of which major ity (37.8%) were from Parallel cousin 28.9% were from Cross cousin mar riages and 33.2% were from the distantly related parents. Psychomotorretardation (20.8%) Primary Amenorrhoea (17.4%) and Mental retardation(10.5 %) topped the list of disorders encountered in the children born toconsangineous parents. A Total of 45.4 % couples already having anaffected child reported pregnancy wastage. In countries where the prob lems of malnutrition and infectious diseases have been overcome societyneeds to turn its attention to the prevention and management of genetic diseases. This is what is strongly advocated for Iran because of its highrate of consanguinity. ,2001
949,The hemoglobinopathies mainly the sickle cell anaemia and the tha lassemias include a heterogeneous group of genetic alterations dissemi nated over the whole world. They consist of a problem of public health inseveral countries including Brazil. The neonatal period is considerated themost effective for the screening of this alterations. This allows prophylaxisand prevention before the appearance of the first symptoms allowingimprovement on the patient s survival and guidance of the parents and het erozygote carrier. The present work aims the early detection of the abnor mal hemoglobins to establishiment standard analysis and examine the via bility of the prevent program. The samples were heel stick collected andthrough blood cord. Electrophoresis procedures HPLC (Bio Rad) andcytological and biochemical analysis were made for the abnormal hemo globins characterization. From April 98 to November 99 1478 neonatalblood samples were analyzed from Hospital de Base S o Jos do RioPreto in which 216 (14 62%) hemoglobins alterations could be found emphasizing 49 (3 32%) with Hb S 9 (0 61%) with Hb C 110 (7 44%) withsuggestive alpha thalassemia 23 (1 55%) with suggestive beta tha lassemia and 25 (1 70%) with interation alpha/beta thalassemia. The sam ples collected from the blood cord showed effectiveness in all analysessuitable while the blood samples hell stick collected in filter paper wereapplicable only to specific methodologies. The hemoglobinopathy suspect ed cases were reassessed after six months and they were led to geneticcounseling and clinic attendance with their family members. The multipro fessional approach in programs of this kind is fundamental for its success. ,2001
950,Cardiovascular performance is a key element in athletic success and cer tain genes are thought to be candiates for regulating cardiac and vascularphysiology. One of the candidate genes is is in the renin angiotensin sys tem. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion allele (ACE I) isa genetic marker that might be associated with improved endurance per formance. In this study ACE polymorphism was studied in past and pres ent Turkish National male athletes who have been competing in nationaland international level for several years.. The athletes were seperated intothree groups consisting of 40 long distance runners 25 sprinters and 30fotball players who are felt to have characteristics of both long and shortdistance athletes. The findings were compared to the results of 100 ran domly selected males from the sedentary Turkish population. GenomicDNA was obtained from white blood cells and and the I and D variants ofthe ACE gene were identified by PCR amplification of the polymorphicregion. The findings show that compared to the normal population the longdistance runners have an excess of the ACE I allele (p<0.05)and the ACEII genotype (p<0.05). On the other hand the sprinters show results verysimilar to the normal population. The fotball players show a slightlyincreased ACE I allele and ACE II genotype but it is not enough to be sta tistically significant. These findings suggest that atleast in the Turkish pop ulation there does seem to be a positive association between enduranceperformance and ACE I allele. ,2001
951,Folic acid (FA) is not only protective for neural tube defects (NTDs) butcould be for other defects as well. Using data from the EUROCAT North ern Netherlands registry we have investigated the possible preventiveeffect of FA in five selected groups of malformations NTDs heart defects oral clefts urinary tract defects and limb reduction defects. A case controlanalysis was performed using the years 1981 through 1998. Information onFA use was collected via the physician pharmacist and mother. Oddsratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using chi square tests. Cases were defined as infants with FA sensitive defects(n=2 751) defects part of chromosomal or monogenic disorders wereexcluded. Controls were all children and foetuses with anomalies otherthan the sensitive anomalies (n=3 647). Use of FA during the periconcep tional period was known for 69.5% (n=1 914) of the cases and for 70.0%(n=2 553) of the controls. Of the FA sensitive cases 67 (3.5%) were peri conceptionally supplemented with FA while this was true for 144 (5.6%)controls. Significantly less case mothers than control mothers took folicacid periconceptionally. More specifically this study showed a significantreduction in risk of heart defects (OR=0.52 95% CI 0.35 0.78) and astrong indication for a reduction in the prevalence of urinary tract defects(OR=0.54 95% CI 0.29 1.02). The OR for NTDs are indicative of a pro tective effect (OR=0.68 95% CI 0.35 1.30). Recall bias is an unlikelyexplanation since sick controls were used as controls. The explanationprobably lies in the power of this study there were not enough cases todetect a significant protective effect of FA for NTDs. Birth defect registrieswill continue to monitor the future effect of FA on birth defects. Thereforethese registries will remain important tools for determining effects of pri mary prevention on other severe congenital anomalies besides NTDs.

M.Ring@Bris.ac.ukThe Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood is a large epi demiological study of approximately 14 000 children designed to investi gate the interplay between genes and environment. A DNA resource hasbeen created using blood samples from approximately 10 000 children and9 000 mothers and is being used for several genetic studies. Cell lines willbe created from the study participants in order to ensure long term provi sion of DNA. Paternal blood is currently unavailable. Therefore a newpostal buccal wash collection and extraction method was piloted to createmother father child trios for transmission tests and imprinting studies. Thismethod was developed for trio studies by the Southampton group andindependently validated for ALSPAC in Bristol. Mouthwash kits were sentto 1386 mothers who were asked if they and their partners would return amouthwash sample for genetic studies. 63% of mothers and 55% of part ners returned a sample. Samples were normally less than 48 hours oldwhen returned although some mothers took up to 3 months to collect thesamples. DNA is extracted using a phenol free method and concentrationmeasured using picogreen. The mean yield is 62 g of DNA (range 2 300 g) per 10ml sample. In initial genotyping studies a PCR success rateof 94.6% has been obtained. Studies are underway to confirm sampleidentity. We expect to generate trios from 52% of the targeted familieswhen parent samples are associated with existing child samples. In con clusion this is a successful method of collecting DNA for epidemiologicalstudies by post ,2001
952,Whole genome amplification offers a means to prepare sufficient DNA fordetailed genetic analysis from biological materials of limited availability. Samples such as biopsies that cannot be cultured forensic samples hairand cheek cell samples and animal scat represent valuable sources ofgenetic material if sufficient DNA can be obtained. The WGA method isbased on a technique called primer enhanced preamplification (PEP).PEP relies on fully degenerate primers to target the PCR amplification ofsequences throughout the genome without bias for sequence content. Bio logical samples including a sliver of skin tissue from a deceased centenar ian keratinocytes from foreskin blood and primate scat were subjected toWGA in order to evaluate the method. The WGA method yielded up to a2 000 fold amplification of the genomic DNA providing up to 2.0 micro grams of WGA DNA from a 1.0 ng aliquot of genomic DNA. Several molec ular assays were undertaken to determine the allelic bias in the samplesand to assess the utility of the material for genetic analysis. For the humansamples the allelic representation of the X and Y chromosome amelo genin alleles and five microsatellites on different autosomes was comparedbetween the WGA products and the original template genomic DNA. TheDNA samples from primates similarly are being assayed using genomicand mitochondrial markers. The results with the human samples indicatethat WGA generates DNA that is representative of the original genomicmaterial at many loci and potentially offers a method for amplification ofDNA from animal samples collected in the field. ,2001
953,SNP s offer a number of advantages with respect to population basedanalysis of the human genome. We present Arrayed Primer Extension(APEX) technology for SNP scoring all over the genome. The method is based upon an array of oligonucleotides immobilized via a 5 end aminolinker onto amino silanized glass slide. Oligonucleotides are selected fromthe sense and antisense genomic sequence so that 3 ends are one baseupstream of the SNP. The amplified DNA template containing the SNP isdigested enzymatically and then annealed to the immobilized primers which promote sites for template dependent DNA polymerase extensionreactions. Four unique fluorescently labeled dye terminators are used toextend each primer by only one base. As a result of this reaction eachprimer identifies one base in the target sequence. The GenoramaÃ¢\x80\x9c imag ing system and software package is used for SNP scoring. In the presentstudy APEX technology was successfully used for SNP based genotyping. We have selected 68 SNPs over the whole genome and estimated theallele frequencies and heterozygosities of these SNPs in Estonian popula tion analyzing 240 chromosomes. From the 68 analyzed SNPs 58 werepolymorphic according to the allele frequencies data. This current oligonu cleotide array with 68 SNPs can be successfully used for paternity testingand forensic analysis. Oligonucleotide design quality DNA Polymerase dye terminators template DNA quality and special software tools are allcritical for the optimal results. APEX method is a reliable tool in SNP stud ies which seem to have a great potential for large scale genotyping in thenear future although method has utility already now in paternity and foren sic testing mutation analysis and SNP scoring. ,2001
954,Studies of the H ras minisatellite have shown that 94% of all alleles innative Europeans and Americans of European descent consist of 4 com mon alleles. The remaining alleles are designated as rare. Rare alleleshave been reported to be associated with cancer in several studies. In this study 11 substitutional polymorphisms within the sequence flankingthe minisatellite have been detected in 40 Castillian and 20 Pygmy chro mosomes and used to construct an allele tree for this locus. The ancestralstate has been inferred by analysing several non human primates allow ing the allele tree to be rooted. The internal structures of these minisatel lite alleles have been deduced by minisatellite variant repeat (MVR) map ping. This information has been integrated with the tree constructed fromflanking haplotypes providing additional information regarding lineageevolution. In addition a survey of allele lengths has been carried out in a UK controlpopulation demonstrating a higher rare allele frequency than was report ed in previous studies. The rare allele frequency of 17% detected is signif icantly greater than that of 6% reported by Krontiris et al. (1993). This islikely to be due to the increased power of the methods used in this studyto detect rare alleles and may have implications for the interpretation ofthe previously published case control studies. ,2001
955,"Association studies based on candidate genes are one of the major strate gies for identifying genes involved in complex traits. However they sufferfrom the fact that they do not overcome the risk of spurious association dueto uncontrolled stratification of the population. Therefore the use of Trans mission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) based methods has been advocated byseveral authors for checking that an observed association is actually dueto linkage and not to other uncontrolled phenomenon. In this paper an esti mating equation procedure is proposed to assess the power and the costefficiency of a classical association and of two TDT type analyses for quan titative phenotypes in sibship data. It is shown that an association analysisis generally more powerful i.e. requires less informative sibs than a TDT type method when the allele frequency of the studied marker is close to0.5. Conversely TDT methods become more powerful when the allele fre quency is low or high all the more since the sibship size is large and theresidual sib sib correlation is strong. However TDT methods alwaysrequire more sibs to be sampled regardless whether or not they areinformative than an association analysis to get the appropriate number ofinformative sibs differences between methods tending to decrease as thesibship clustering increases.262 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population GeneticsP0834. Regression based inference for association of haplo type frequencies with the phenotype. D. V. Zaykin1 P. H. Westfall2 S. S. Young3 1Statistical Genetics GlaxoWellcome Inc. Research Triangle Park NC United States 2Texas Tech University Lubbock TX United States 3Glax oWellcome Inc. Research Triangle Park NC United S', 'There are increasing efforts to relate clinically important phenotypes suchas disease predisposition drug efficacy or glucose level to singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recent research gives exampleswhere several SNPs in haplotypes affect the phenotype so there are bio logical and statistical interactions. It is important to develop statisticalmethods to identify and deal with these interactions. We give statisticaltests for association of haplotype frequencies with discrete and continuoustraits in samples of unrelated individuals. There is a need to deal with unre lated individuals as many data sets e.g. clinical trials will not have pedi gree data. We present conditions for asymptotic equivalence of regression based methods with methods that double the sample size in the case ofknown haplotypes. Then we extend these models to the case of statisti cally inferred haplotypes. We confirm that our methods have excellentpower while maintaining type I error. We present applications to gene map ping using epidemiologic data with adjacent markers and show that ourmethods improve the efficiency of genome scans by incorporating infor mation from consecutive markers.

956,Despite tremendous efforts few genetic risk factors involved in the sus ceptibility for complex disorders have been identified so far. One reason forthis may be that ignored gene environment interaction conceals effects ofgenetic factors on disease. To investigate whether this could be an expla nation we have studied the power to detect gene effects of family basedtests of association in the presence of a gene environment (GXE) interac tion. Family based association tests that use case parent trios can allowfor the detection of a gene effect and a GXE interaction by the comparisonof the allele transmissions from parents to exposed and unexposed cases. We have compared the power of the test that account for the GXE inter action and of the test that does not under different exposure frequenciesand several models of GXE interaction. We show that the gain of powerdue to accounting for GXE interaction is highly dependent on the popula tion exposure frequency and on the exposure effect it is higher when theexposure is rare and when the exposure effect is low. When the exposurefrequency is high (>30%) and/or the exposure effect is strong there mayeven be a decrease in power when accounting for the GXE interaction. Forgiven exposure frequency and effect we found that the gain in power isusually stronger for dominant as compared to recessive models. ,2001
957,Now that the human genome is mapped genetic research will focus onunderstanding the function of each gene. The genetic profile of an individ ual is shaped by geographical cultural and socio economic considera tions all of which are underpinned by biological evolution. Hence therenewed interest in population research. The genetic profile of small iso lated populations may ease the discovery of gene function. Indeed popu lation genetics holds the key to individual genetic medicine. Genetic epi demiology in heterogenous populations is also of interest to health author ities. Consequently we observe emerging national DNA banks in Iceland Estonia England Sweden Newfoundland (Canada) and Quebec (Cana da). Genetic research has been framed by a wide set of legislation andinternational guidelines. However genetic research the scale of a popula tion brings issues which are not addressed by current frameworks. TheQuebec Network of Applied Genetic Medicine is working on the creation ofa population bank to study SNP variation within the general Quebec pop ulation. To do so it is developing guidelines for population geneticresearch. Our presentation will first discuss the ten fundamental principleson which the guidelines are founded. Second we will focus on certainthemes elaborated in the guidelines such as population assent communi cation of research results commercialisation and benefit sharing. ,2001
958,Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provide a good settingfor the fine mapping of complex traits their density and abundance burdendata analysis more than ever. In order to decide which SNP loci in a largepool synergistically influence a particular disease the mere marker by marker method is not efficient because it ignores correlations among mark ers and requires conservative multiple testing adjustment. Large scaleapproaches in which information on multiple markers is bundled to a teststatistic should overcome these difficulties. Earlier we proposed a two stage analysis of association data in which first a subset of markers isselected and secondly interactions between these markers and the dis ease are modeled. Here we address a question that arose in the firststage of the analysis how to combine marker specific statistics in order toachieve the optimal detection power. In principle each SNP is initiallyassigned an index that measures the association strength between the disease status and its genotypes. For example this index can be the usualChi square statistic. Then information is to be combined either by simplysumming those indices or by the empirical Bayesian method. In doing so it leads us to explore the whole class of the James Stein estimators. ,2001
959,The ultimate goal of genetic association studies which should be viewedwithin the larger framework of epidemiological studies of risk factor/dis ease associations is to identify gene(s) responsible for a given disease. Todetect a genetic association the easiest design is the case controlapproach which usually apply a chi square analysis to look at the signifi cance of an association. The test is simple and does not depend on anypopulation genetic theory or model other than that which supposes thestrength of an association between genes increases when physical andgenetic distances between them decrease. The major problem with thecase control design is the identification of an appropriate control sample to avoid spurious associations due to potential confounding factors relatedto population admixture or stratification. To deal with these issues variousmethods have been proposed as for example using a set of unrelatedpolymorphisms to evaluate the extent of random association (Devlin &Roeder Biometrics 1999). We propose an alternative strategy for geneticassociation in a case control sample by applying a logistic regression (LR)model which allows for the simultaneous consideration of other risk and/orconfounding factors. Using a data set from a case control multicenterEuropean Collaborative study with a response variable (i.e. the diagno sis) a predictor (i.e. a risk allele for the 5HT2C gene variant) and a con founder (i.e. the ethnical origin of cases and controls) we show that theLR outcome is equivalent to the Mantel Haenszel test (MH) for multiplecontingency tables. Both the statistical approaches lead to the same result showing a positive association despite substantial population variabilityacross the participating centers. The advantages of this alternative modelwill be discussed. ,2001
960,After two decades developing statistical methods applicable to DNA mark ers genetic epidemiology is emerging into the sunlight of modern biology. Advances can be grouped into four categories mapping positionalcloning nonclassical inheritance and complex genetic systems. Physicalmapping is now sequence based constraining order on the linkage mapand interpolating for loci without linkage information. It will be shown thatthis gives dramatic reduction of error. Further improvement will come fromways to define recombination hot spots and cold spots in small regions thatcannot be reliably mapped by linkage. These approaches include thedecline of allelic association between SNPs and identification of recombi nation prone repeat sequences. Positional cloning depends on linkageand linkage disequilibrium (LD) with markers localised on integrated maps LD providing the greater resolution. Examples will be given for both majorloci and oligogenes using the Malecot equation for allelic association together with evidence that the latter is substantially more efficient thanalternative metrics. Nonclassical mechanisms include imprinted diseaseloci dynamic mutation and possibly concatenated mutation. Complexinheritance has been approached by weakly parametric ( nonparametric )methods including variance components and sib pairs that do not separategene frequency and effect as well as by parametric methods that combinesegregation linkage and association with ascertainment correction. Bothapproaches allow synthesis of evidence over multiple studies as illustrat ed by asthma and (at higher resolution) by SNPs within the ACE locus. Finally brief consideration will be given to current ethical legal and socialissues raised by population genetics. ,2001
961,Several model free methods of linkage analysis compare the observedallele sharing of pairs of affected individuals with the one expected underno linkage given only the genealogical relationship. In multipoint analyses the allele sharing is estimated taking into account the joint information pro vided by all the genetic markers in a region. Different statistics such as theMLS or the NPL have been proposed. There is evidence for linkage if thevalue of the statistics at a given marker exceeds a given threshold func tion of the number of markers tested. However the statistics are often eval uated at different locations on and between the markers. When looking atthe curves that give the value of the statistics as a function of the positionin the map of markers one striking feature is the little bumps that can beseen between markers indicating that the value of the statistic is higherbetween than on the markers. The maximum value of the statistics over aregion is indeed often found between two markers rather than on the mark ers themselves although the information content is smaller between themarkers. In order to investigate whether this could lead to an inflation of thetype one error we have performed simulations under the null hypothesisof no linkage and compare the type one errors under two analysis strate gies including or excluding intermarker locations. The results are report ed for different marker map densities and between marker steps. The inter est of the two strategies is discussed. ,2001
962,2 549 SNPs were discovered in approximately 465 kb DNA sequence from174 human genes with known genomic organization. DNA sequencing wasperformed on one chimpanzee and 82 unrelated individuals includingAfrican Americans Asians European Americans and Hispanic Latinos. The data were collected from several gene regions including exons exon intron boundaries untranslated regions and 5 flanking sequences. Theaverage nucleotide diversity for 166 autosomal genes was p=0.063% andq=0.103% while the average nucleotide diversity for eight X linked geneswas p=0.052% and q=0.070%. Of the four ethnic groups considered theAfrican American sample had the highest average nucleotide diversity fol lowed by the Hispanic Latino European American and Asian groups. Hap lotypes were inferred using a variation of the Expectation Maximizationalgorithm and linkage disequilibrium (D ) was calculated between pairs ofSNPs within each gene. Because allele frequencies affect linkage disequi librium calculations only SNPs that occurred at least five times in eachpopulation were considered in these analyses. The ~8 000 remaining pair wise comparisons were stratified by ethnic group and physical distancebetween SNPs. In general the European American sample had the high est levels of linkage disequilibrium and the African Americans the lowest although the median D value for all ethnic groups was 1 suggesting highoverall levels of intragenic linkage disequilibrium. The observed relation ship between linkage disequilibrium and physical distance was highlyunpredictable however most of our inter SNP physical distances wereless than 10 kb. The complex relationship between linkage disequilibriumand physical distance within genes highlights the need to constructdetailed population specific empirical linkage disequilibrium maps of thehuman genome. ,2001
963,Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a complex of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] and lowdensity lipoprotein which is associated with atherothrombotic disease. Lp(a) plasma levels are controlled to a large extend by the apo(a) genelocus. Known polymorphisms in the apo(a) gene including the kringle IV 2variable number of tandem repeats explain only part of the large interindi vidual variability and do not explain the differences in Lp(a) concentrations264 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Geneticsbetween major human ethnic groups. We here performed screening for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons and flanking intronsequences of the apo(a) kringle IV types 6 8 9 and 10 which represent1.3 kb of coding sequence in two African (Khoi San Black South Africans)and one Caucasian (Tyroleans) populations and investigated whether theyaffect Lp(a) levels. Together 768 alleles were analysed. We identified four teen SNPs including eleven non synonymous eight of which involved con served residues one splice site and two synonymous base changes. Nosequence variants common to Africans and Caucasians were found. Someof the newly identified SNPs showed significant effects on Lp(a) plasmaconcentrations e.g. the substitution G17R in K IV 8 was associated withLp(a) levels significantly below average in the two African samples. On thecontrary the R18W substitution in K IV 9 which occurred with a frequencyof ~8% in Khoi San resulted in a significantly increased Lp(a) concentra tion. Together our data show that several SNPs in the coding sequence ofapo(a) affect Lp(a) levels. ,2001
964,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to steroid 21 hydroxylase defi ciency is a common inherited defect of adrenal steroid hormone biosyn thesis. Unusually for a genetic disorder the majority of mutations causingCAH result from recombinations between the CYP21 gene encoding the21 hydroxylase enzyme and the closely linked highly homologouspseudogene CYP21P. The CYP21 and CYP21P genes are located in themajor histocompatibility complex class III region on chromosome 6p21.3 a region that undergoes high recombination rates. Studies on the molecu lar basis of steroid 21 hydroxylase deficiency in Brazil have revealed thepresence of fourteen mutations distributed among 117 chromosomes. Thepercentages of individual mutations does not differ from those found in dif ferent populations. We have performed haplotype analysis on a total of 111chromosomes using Taq I CPY21 and C4 RFLP/Southern blotting muta tion specific PCR and PCR/RFLP for two intragenic SNPs in order to eval uate the chromosomal background of ten recurrent mutations and four newmutations. Fifty four different haplotypes were identified. Number of CYP21 gene affected alleles and haplotypes The number of haplotypes varied from five to nine for each the five most frequent mutations. These data reflect the wide heterogeneity of the Brazil ian population and show that most recurrent mutations on the CYP21gene are from various independent origins and do not present foundereffect.

965,A wide variety of mutations in the parkin gene including exon deletionsand multiplications as well as point mutations result in autosomal reces sive early onset parkinsonism. Interestingly several of these anomalieswere found repeatedly in independent patients and may therefore resultfrom recurrent (de novo) mutational events or founder effects. In the pres ent study haplotype analysis with 10 microsatellite markers covering a 4.7cM region containing the parkin gene was performed in 48 families withearly onset autosomal recessive Parkinson s disease mostly from Euro pean countries. The patients carried 14 different mutations of the parkingene that were detected more than once. Our results support the hypoth esis that exon rearrangements occurred independently whereas somepoint mutations found in families of different geographical origins may have been transmitted by a common founder. ,2001
966,The consequences of pulmonary disease are the main death cause of cys tic fibrosis patients. Nevertheless no complete association between theseverity of lung disease and the CFTR genotype has been found. There fore it is hypothesized that other genetic factors like defensins compo nents of the innate immune system might influence the sensitivity of CFpatients to pulmonary infections. Mutations in these peptides couldincrease or decrease their activity and thereby influence the sensitivity tobacterial infections. In order to analyze the possible modulatory role ofhuman beta defensin (hBD)1 and 2 in pulmonary diseases associated withCF the hBD1 and 2 intron boundaries and exons of 60 Italian homozygousÃ\x98F508 CF patients showing different levels of pulmonary disease and of90 Belgian and 90 Italian control individuals were amplified by PCR andsequenced on the ABI 377. Most of the nucleotide changes found in the5 UTR the 3 UTR and the introns are very frequent (more than 20%). How ever no frequency differences were found between the control and theaffected populations and between the Italian and the Belgian controls. Also no correlation with the age of first colonization of CF patients byPseudomonas aeruginosa was observed. In hBD2 intron1 multiple inser tion/deletion polymorphisms were found. The coding regions of both genesare prone to rare nucleotide changes with some of them causing aminoacid changes four in hBD1 G22C and C67S in Belgian controls andH34R and V38I in Italian CF patients and only one in hBD2 M16I (ItalianCF patient and Italian control). The promoters are very polymorphic butthese nucleotide changes are mostly very rare. We can conclude that bothgenes are very polymorphic. No association with CF has been found up tonow. Further analysis could however increase our insight into the role thatdefensins play in the innate immune system our first defense againstmicrobia. ,2001
967,"Homogeneous phase fluorescence based assays provide powerful toolsfor detection of specific nucleic acid sequences. We have developedassays based on the use of primers labeled with a single fluorescent dyewhich do not require a specific quenching moiety. These fluorescentprimers exhibit a large increase in intensity when incorporated into doublestranded DNA. This property provides a platform for real time or endpointdetection of nucleic acids in a closed tube and requires no additional stepssubsequent to PCR. We demonstrate the use of fluorescein labeledprimers to detect product in allele specific amplification (ASA) reactions onSNP targets. The effect of changes in the design of the ASA primer forimproved discrimination is shown. We also demonstrate the use of a novelDNA polymerase which improves discrimination. Homogeneous phasedetection of the allele specific products is demonstrated by real time analy sis during the PCR or by endpoint analysis in a fluorescence plate reader. Alternatively multiplex PCR of several SNP targets of different sizes canbe resolved on an automated fluorescence sequencer. This approach although not utilizing the potential for homogeneous phase detection offers the advantage of higher throughput for analysis of multiple SNP tar gets. This system is shown to be readily adaptable to a universal allele for mat where the ASA primer contains a 5 tail identical to the 3 portion of thelabeled primer. The identification of alternate labels to fluorescein permitssingle tube genotyping. The combination of improvements to allele specif ic amplification with a flexible homogeneous phase fluorescent detectionsystem provide a simple and reliable method for genotyping of SNP tar gets.

A demogenetic analysis of lipoprotein lipase D9N mutation carriers in the Saguenay population (Quebec Cana da) M. Tremblay1 J. Lambert1 D. Gaudet2 1University of Quebec at Chicoutimi Chicoutimi PQ Canada 2Lipid Research Group Chicoutimi Hospital Chicoutimi PQ C', 'D9N mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) is associated to a dom inant risk of coronary disease with variable expression and penetrance and to arterial hypertension susceptibility. Clinical studies performed at theChicoutimi Hospital (Quebec Canada) suggest a relatively high preva lence of this mutation in the Saguenay population. The present study aimsat explaining the distribution and origins of the D9N mutation in this popu lation with the use of genealogical data. A sample of 39 carriers was drawnfrom files at the Chicoutimi Hospital Lipid Clinic. Genealogical data wasobtained from the BALSAC population register. This register was also usedto choose control individuals and reconstruct genealogies. These extend ed and deep rooted genealogies go back to the 17th century (up to 16 gen erations) with an average depth of 10 generations. More than 12000 dis tinct ancestors were identified in both groups (carriers and controls). Mea sures of kinship inbreeding and ancestors concentration showed signifi cantly higher levels within the carriers group. Intergroup kinship coeffi cients were also higher than controls intragroup kinship coefficients. How ever no great difference was observed between the two groups as regardsto the ancestors geographical origins. Most regional founders (19th centu ry) came from the adjacent region of Charlevoix while early founders (17thcentury) came mainly from the French regions of Normandie Ile de France Poitou and Aunis.

968,The study of polymorphisms in enzymes associated with the absorption distribution metabolism and excretion (ADME) of xenobiotics is a criticalfactor in our ability to rationalise an individual s response to different med icines. To date there has been very little data presented on the frequencyof these so called metabolic polymorphisms in specific poplulations themost detail being available currently for the cytochrome P450 isozymesCYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Here we have attempted to expand our knowl edge in this area by developing a panel of TaqMan assays for the routinegenotyping of over 60 metabolic polymorphisms. This study will alsoenable us to begin to answer a question which is perhaps more importantfor the Pharmaceutical Industry how representative are clinical trials ofthe general population? Further statistical analyses may enable us to cor relate the genotype data with various phenotypic parameters (measuredduring clinical studies) thus enabling us to move towards the prediction ofan individual s metabolic capability with respect to a medicine by virtueof their genotype. In conclusion this report describes the design and devel opment of low volume TaqMan genotyping assays for 64 potentially func tional polymorphisms in various ADME associated genes. We have sub sequently used these assays to determine the allele frequencies of thesepolymorphisms in four defined populations. The information presentedhere will be a valuable aid to the further understanding of population dif ferences in this important area of research. ,2001
969,Background Early onset periodontal diseases (EOP) are a group of inflam matory disorders characterised by a rapid rate of periodontal tissuedestruction in young individuals. There is now substantial evidence to sug gest that genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of EOP. Periodon tal disease is a major public health issue of worldwide significance. It is achronic inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues of the teeth start ing with gingivae and progressing to gradual destruction of the bony sup port and peridontal attachment of the teeth. This results in significant mor bidity with loosening and loos of teeth the ultimate outcome. Indeed improved prevention and treatment of tooth decay has resulted in peri dontal disease becoming the most common cause of tooth loss in Europeand the USA. Polymorphisms in cytokine genes which may underpin interindividual differences in cytokine synthesis and secretion have been asso ciated with other diseases which have an inflammatory pathogenesis Genetic variations found within candidate genes in EOP patients may rep resent a mechanism by which individuals are rendered susceptible to dis ease. Objective To investigate whether a biallelic polymorphism (A or G)occurring within the promoter region of the IL 1b gene (position 511) isassociated with EOP. Methods The 511 polymorphism was detectedusing a PCR RFLP method. IL 1b polymorphism was examined in 97patients with EOP and 91 healthy matched UK controls. Result Conclusion Several polymorphisms exist in the IL 1 cluster that influences the IL 1b biological activity. Our results demonstrated a possible role for IL 1b gene in the development of EOP.

970,"The role of melatonin in normal sleep wake regulation has been inferredfrom the temporal relationships between its rhythmic synthesis and the 24hours cycle. The biochemical basis of this hormone rhythm is the penulti mate rate limiting enzyme in melatonin synthesis Arylalkylamine N acetyl transferase (AANAT). [Axelrod 1974 Klein 1985 Namboodiri et al. 1985]. Specifically our current study focuses on characterizing the AANATgene in a local population and looking for possible genetic variability thatmay explain the widely documented variation in sleep pattern among nor mal human individuals. A self assessed sleep pattern survey was conduct ed among 210 healthy young and drug free human subjects based on awhole week practice. Data pertaining to normal sleep onset offset andtotal nocturnal sleep duration was obtained. Circulating blood sampleswere collected from 4 individuals with early onset and long sleep length and 5 individuals with late onset and short sleep length. Polymerase chainreaction (PCR) amplification of the genomic DNA containing all of the fourexons of AANAT gene was done. Analysis of PCR products by directsequencing demonstrated that all the 36 sequences were identical with thepublished data. Therefore there is no evidence of genetic variability in thecoding region of AANAT gene that may explain the extreme differences insleep pattern. More studies are being conducted to examine the promoterregions for AANAT. 266 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics IL 1Ã\x9f 511 polymorphism allel and genotype distribution in EOP patients Controls EOP patients IL 1Ã\x9f genotype n % n % Allele frequency 511*G 53 29.1 83142.8 511*A 129 70.9 111 57.2 Genotype G/G 7 7.7 17217.5 G/A 39 42.9 49 50.5 A/A 45 49.4 31 32.0 1O.

971,Leptin a cytokine expressed and secreted by the adipose tissue isinvolved in the regulation of body weight. Leptin levels in subjects withanorexia nervosa are low although the correlation with body mass index isstill evident. We and others have shown an association between the lep tin receptor SNP GLN223ARG and fat mass body mass index (BMI) andleptin levels. The aim of this study was to determine if this associationcould be found in young female Caucasian control subjects and if differ ences in allele frequency existed in female Caucasian subjects withanorexia nervosa. 175 subjects with anorexia nervosa (divided into binge ing/purging and restricting anorexics) were recruited from the YorkshireCentre for Eating Disorders at Seacroft Hospital. 145 controls were recruit ed from the University of Leeds. In both cohorts allele frequencies forGLN223ARG did not differ significantly from published frequencies (Aallele 0.61 and 0.56 G allele 0.39 and 0.44 in anorexia and control cohortsrespectively). There was no significant difference in genotype frequencybetween the control and the anorexic cohorts or between restricting andbingeing subjects with anorexia. The previously published associationbetween BMI and genotype was not observed in either cohort. This maystrengthen the existing evidence that this association is only observed inolder middle aged males and postmenopausal subjects. ,2001

HR semiquantitative discrete trait regulated by the ANS is involved in bloodpressure (BP) regulation which is admitted that is genetically determined although the mechanism is controversial due to the many regulation com ponents. There are papers supporting the BP Mendelian inheritance (MH)hypothesis though mixed models admitting the involvement of polygenesand environmental influences are more appropriate. We have published(Med Hypotheses(2000)54(2)307 9 a hypothesis considering the probableMH of HR. Objective To demonstrate through SA methods HR MH.

973,Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessively inherited genetic diseasewhich results from the mutations in the gene encoding Cystic FibrosisTransmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)protein. It is important toanalyze the modulating and modifying effects on phenotype since we havegenotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity among patients. In our study weinvestigated TAP 1 and TAP 2 gene polymorphisms in CF. The TAP genes(transporter associated with antigen processing) encode two membrane spanning ABC proteins that translocate antigenic peptides from the cyto plasm into the endoplasmic reticulum. TAP 1 and 2 genes are localizedwithin the MHC class II region. Polymorphisms in the TAP genes are asso ciated with the specificity of the binding of antigenic peptides. Comparisonof 58 CF patients whose CFTR mutations were determined previously and100 Turkish controls revealed a significant increase in the Ala/Ala dimor phism at position 665 of TAP 2 gene in CF patients as compared to con trols (p<0.025). Furthermore Gly phenotype at position 637 of TAP 1 genewas seen in CF patients in a significantly higher ratio (p<0.05). ,2001

975,The glutation S transferase (GST) are widely expressed in mammalian tis sues and involved in phase II detoxification reactions. The GST form asupergene family consisting of four distinct families named alpha (GSTA) mu (GSTM) theta (GSTT) and pi (GSTP). Several of GST are polymorphicin humans. Among the GST genes we examined GSTT1 and GSTM1 poly morphism in some populations from Russian Federation Russians fromHolmogory and Oshevensk (Arkchangelsk region) and three populationswith different level of Mongoloid component Chant Kalmyk and Buryat. We observed that frequency of GSTM1 null genotype are significantlyhigher in Chant Kalmyk and Buryat than in Russians from Arkchangelskreg. For GSTT1 gene null genotype frequency was statistically higher forPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 267Kalmyk (p=0 03) but in Chant and Buryat it was similar as in Russians from Arkchangelsk region. Frequency GSTM1 (0/0) GSTT1 (0/0) in sumfor Kalmyk was 18% there as in other populations it wasn t bigger than5%. Comparing Mongoloid populations with Russians using Chi squred cri terium and G statistic one can see that Kalmyk population mostly variesfrom Russians populations and differences between Chant Buryat andRussians are less expressed. We can note that population differences aremore conditioned by difference in GSTT1 genotype frequency. GeneGSTM1 has less marked divergence in populations and this gene fre quencies hardly vary for Oshevensk Holmogory and Chant populations. ,2001
976,The tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (TNFRSF6)gene encoding FAS a cell surface receptor involved in apoptosis initiation was recently reported to constitute a genetic risk factor for early onsetAlzheimer s disease (EOAD). Dynamic allele specific hybridization (DASH)analysis of the Ã¢\x80\x94670 G/A polymorphism showed enrichment of the homozy gous GG genotype in Scottish sporadic EOAD cases almost completelyattributable to enrichment within the subset of APOE4 carriers (Feuk etal. 2000). In this study we analyzed the promoter polymorphism in a Dutchpopulation based EOAD case control sample using the same technique but could not detect a significant disease association. Thus our study doesnot reinforce the hypothesis of an independent involvement of theTNFRSF6 670 G/A polymorphism in AD risk. In this study we also com pared the reliability of DASH and pyrosequencing analysis and demon strated the robustness of the two techniques by genomic sequencing. ,2001
977,Chemokine receptor CCR5 serves as the major co receptor for HIV 1. Sev eral polymorphisms in the CCR5 gene are known to affect the susceptibil ity/resistance to HIV 1 and/or the rate of progression to AIDS. The fre quencies of these polymorphisms as well as their infection/disease modi fying effect vary in different populations. Most of the data available in thisfield were obtained in the studies of Americans of various ethnic/racial ori gin. Very little in this respect is known about Arabic populations. We stud ied the frequencies of two CCR5 gene polymorphisms m303 and 59029 A/G in Kuwaitis. The genotyping for both polymorphisms was carried outby PCR RFLP tests. The m303 allele was not found in any of 230 Kuwait is genotyped for this marker (the allele frequency is less that 0.002). Thefrequency of protective allele 59029 G in Kuwaitis (0.66 no. of chromo somes = 266) was higher than that in other populations for which the fre quencies of the allele have been reported. The modifying effect of 59029 A/G genotype as well as two other genetic markers associated with slow er progression to AIDS (CCR2 64I and SDF 3 A) is being investigated inHIV infected Kuwaitis.

978,Recent advances suggest a possible relationship between Alzheimer s dis ease (AD) and atherosclerosis. This makes interesting to examine thecoronary artery disease (CAD) candidate gene polymorphisms in AD too. In the present investigation we examined a polymorphism in the paraox onase gene (PON1) due to an A > G substitution at amino acid position 192 which has been found associated with cardiovascular diseases though with conflicting results. A group of late onset sporadic AD patientsand a group of patients with CAD were studied in order to compare theresults between them and with normal subjects. Most of the patients wereultraoctuagenarians. Significant differences in the allele frequenciesbetween patient groups and correspondent controls were observed. In par ticular the AD patients aged ? 80 (n= 152) showed a frequency of thePON1*Q allele significantly higher than the control group (0.832 vs 0.741 p = 0.003). Also CAD patients aged ? 80 (n=56) had a PON1*Q allele fre quency (0.848) higher than their controls (0.743) (p=0.04). A CAD patientgroup aged < 80 (n= 144) showed an opposite pattern with an PON1*Rallele frequency (0.260) significantly higher than their controls (0.154)(p=0.01) confirming the previously reported association of PON1 *R allelewith CAD. In summary our data suggest that the association of PON1*Qwith both AD and CAD is peculiar to ultraoctuagenarian patients. ,2001

Epidemiological study has revealed the cycliccharacter of the CM frequency fluctuation in range from 13 9 to 35 2 with the mean 23 65 . Significant increasing in the frequency of overallCM spectrum has been disclosed (from 22 8 up 26 P<0 01). The sum mary frequency of the isolated forms of CM has increased significantly butthe frequencies of multiple CM and Down s syndrome have decreased. The average frequency of 19 forms of CM registered according the Euro pean register EUROCAT has been estimated as 14 2 not dif fering from the basic level of CM. In CM structure the most frequent were the defectsof osteomuscular system multiple CM nervous system cardiovascularsystem face and neck. Regarding the separate CM forms the most fre quent were congenital heart defects Down syndrome hydrocephaly andhypospadia. ,2001

981, The apolipoprotein AI and CIII (apo AI and CIII) play an important role inthe metabolism of plasma lipoproteins and lipids. The apo AI CIII genecluster is located in chromosome 11q23 and more than 20 different RFLPshave been described in this gene cluster. To search for a useful geneticmarker for the essential hypertension in Korean population the distributionof two restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLPs) of the apo AI CIIIgene cluster and their association on essential hypertension was investi gated in total 163 Korean individuals. The distribution of the genotypes ofall the RFLPs was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in this population. the G 75?A polymorphism of the apo AI gene was significantly associated withessential hypertension in Korean population (P<0.05). Therefore thisresult suggest that the G 75?A polymorphism of the apo AI gene may beuseful as a genetic marker for essential hypertension in Korean population. ,2001

983,To examine the relative role of genetic and environmental factors on pelvicmorphology and menarcheal status data on 60 pairs of female twins (30MZ and 30 DZ) were analyzed. Various pelvic mesurements were normal ly distributed except for two of sixteen instances. Association of twin typewith the mean value was found in only one out of eight traits which mightbe attributed to type 1 error. Heterogeneity of variance between zygositieswas observed for four pelvic traits (50%) suggesting considerable amountof hidden environmental influence. No evidence of stronger environmentalcovariance for MZ than DZ twins was observed. Significant genetic com ponent of variation was observed for pelvic height bi ischeal breadth ageat menarche and pelvic area. In instnces where inequality of variancesbetween zygosities were demonstrated total among pair and within pairmean squares were larger for dizygotic than for monozygotic twins. This isinterpreted as evidence of greater environmental influence betweenzygosities. Environmental modification shawing phenotypic plasticity wasnot of same magnitude in various pelvic traits thus indicating differentialselection pressures. Similar differences were observed in the magnitude ofcultural inheritance. ,2001
984,Chemokines are small chemotactic proteines that mediate innate andadaptive immune responses and inflammatory processes through the G protein coupled receptors. Previous studies have shown that the temporalexpression of certain CC chemokines and the CCR5 chemokine receptorin the pancreas is associated with the development of the insulitis andspontaneous type I diabetes. It is known that some time before onset ofdiabetes type I inflammatory process takes place in the pancreas. In the present study we have determined the frequency of the ccr5delta32 allelein diabetes type I (n=38 age 15 62 average 34 5y) and diabetes type II(n=113 age 42 77 average 63 3y) patients. In control group of healthy unrelated native Estonians (n=504 age 14 94 average 54y) theccr5delta32 allele frequency was 0 148. In diabetes type II cohort and indiabetes type I group the deleted allele frequency was 0 106 and 0 141respectively (p>0 05). Results indicated that the deleted allele of theCCR5 receptor gene has no significant association with disease frequen cy in both types of diabetes. In the case of type I diabetes there was a sig nificant (p<0 05) difference in the onset time and duration of the diseasebeing earlier and longer in the wild type homozygotes compared toccr5delta32 heterozygotes. In the type I diabetes the analysis of the corre lation between clinical signs and ccr5delta32 genotype is in progress. ,2001
985,The association between gene polymorphisms affecting drug metaboliz ing enzymes (DMEs) activity and chronic hepatitis C severity was studiedby univariate and multivariate analysis. Two classes of DMEs genes wereconsidered phase I enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism (CYP2E1 CYP2D6) and phase II enzymes involved in conjugation of toxic com pounds (GSTM1 GSTT1 Epoxide Hydrolase EPHX). Polymorphismswere screened on cohort of 400 anti HCV+ Italian patients divided into fourgroups asymptomatic carriers chronic hepatitis cirrhosis and hepatocel lular carcinoma (HCC) patients. A cohort of 100 healthy subjects was con sidered as reference category. Inherited differences in several DMEs activ ities were found to be significantly associate with liver disease expression. In particular high activity phase I enzymes variants and low activity phaseII enzyme alleles occurred more frequently among subjects with advancedliver disease. This effect was more pronounced in males and consideringextreme patient categories (carriers and cirrhosis/HCC). Two multivariateanalysis techniques (logistic regression and correspondence analysis)were used to model the unconfounded contribution of these genetic traitsand their interaction controlling for known variables of liver disease pro gression (age sex HCV genotype and alcohol consumption). An inde pendent and synergistic effect in predicting cirrhosis and/or HCC wasobserved for two characters EPHX T113H homozygosity and CYP2D6EM phenotype. Genetic epidemiology techniques may provide clinicallymeaningful information useful for the dissection of complex disease traitssuch as those involved in chronic hepatitis C progression. ,2001
986,Scanning of the 5 exons of OPG gene was performed for 85 patients withosteoporosis or osteopenia. PCR HD and PCR SSCP analyses of genom ic DNA revealed 6 polymorphisms localized in the intronic region and onepolymorphism in exon 1. Five of these different polymorphic variants weresubstitutions IVS1+15C>T IVS2+4C>T IVS3 5C>T IVS4 24C>A IVS4+8A>C and one was a 2 bp deletion IVS3+46delTC. One polymor phism 9G>C detected in exon 1 resulted in a change in the encodedamino acid from positively charged lysine to neutral asparagine and waspreviously observed in cDNA clones. Because this polymorphism affectsconserved region of the osteoprotegerin signal peptide and could influenceof secreted protein we studied the polymorphic allele frequencies in thepatient and control population and looked for evidence of associationbetween the polymorphism and osteoporosis. The change 9G>C does notcreate a new restriction site and therefore PCR SSCP analysis was usedto determine allele status by comparison with sequenced control samples. First we observed that genotype distribution was in Hardy Weinberg equi librium for control population (CC=23/97 GC=45/97 GG=29/97 c2=0.458 df=2 p=0.79) we then determined OPG genotype distribution for patientswith severe osteoporosis CC=13/56 GC=36/56 GG=7/56. The genotypeand allele frequencies in a combined group of 85 patients with osteoporo sis or osteopenia revealed CC=25/85 GC=47/85 and GG=13/85. Therewere no significant differences in lumbar spine BMD for groups of osteo porotic women and men with different genotypes but genotypes with allelePosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 269C were over represented in patients with severe osteoporosis as com pared with population group (c2 =5.69 df=1 p<0.02). This is equivalent toodds ratio for osteoporosis of 2.99 for individuals who carry allele C (95%confidence interval 1.20 7.42). Significant differences in combined group ofpatients with severe osteoporosis or osteopenia as compared with popu lation group (c2 =5.31 df=1 p<0.025) was also observed (odds ratio 2.36 95% confidence interval 1.13 4.94). ,2001
987,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease with strong familial aggre gation but relatively low genetic risk (?s ~ 2). The strongest risk factors fortype 2 diabetes include family history obesity and factors associated withinsulin resistance and ÃÂ§ cell dysfunction each of which may be mediatedin part by genetic factors. The IRAS Family Study characterizes importantdiabetes related traits with respect to their familial aggregation and ulti mately linkage to polymorphic DNA markers in African American (AA) andHispanic American (HA) families. A total of 61 families (22 AA and 39 HA) comprising 650 individuals withphenotypic data were used for these analyses. Frequently sampled intra venous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGT) were performed on eligible sub jects and analyzed using the minimal model to obtain estimates of insulinsensitivity (SI) glucose effectiveness (SG) and insulin secretion (acute insulin response to glucose AIR). The disposition index (DI) a measure ofinsulin resistance corrected ÃÂ§ cell function was also derived (DI= AIR*SI) as was the HOMA measure (HOMA=fasting insulin*fasting glu cose/22.5). Variance components analyses were employed to estimatefamilial aggregation (heritability h 2) using the SOLAR software package. After adjustment for age sex race and BMI h2estimates were SI 19 + 8% (p < 0.001) SG 19 + 11% (p < 0.02) AIR 5 + 8% (p = 0.26) DI 4 + 7% (p = 0.29) and HOMA 15 + 9% (p < 0.03). These results suggest that there is modest heritability for SIand SGas diabetes related quantitative traits in this population. ,2001
988,Factor VII is a procoagulant protein that initiates blood clotting with itscofactor Tissue Factor. Polymorphic variations in the Factor VII (FVII) genecorrelate with cardiovascular disease risk in both familial and non familialstudies. The FVII A2 allele contains a 10 nt insert (CCTATATCTT at 323 inthe FVII promoter where +1 is the start of translation) and occurs in 10 20% of the population. The A2 allele is associated with a 15 30%decreased FVII level per allele. Two additional SNPs at 122(C/T) and 401(G/A) have been reported to occur in complete linkage disequilibriumwith the decanucleotide insert in the Italian population. In vitro assays havepreviously shown a significantly decreased FVII promoter strength of theA2 compared to the A1 allele and have further shown that this requires theconcurrent presence of the 122 and 401 polymorphisms. Using both DNAsequence analysis and the Nanogen NanoChipTM we analyzed 28African American individuals for the presence of the 401/ 323/ and 122polymorphisms. Twenty eight percent were found to have a new allele con taining the 401 and 323 but not the 122 polymorphisms. The averageFVII level in individuals with this allele was similar to that with the A1 allelewhereas the combined 401/ 323/ 122 allele showed the expected signifi cant 30% decrease in Factor VII levels. In summary we have shown in vivothat the decanucleotide insert in the absence of the 122 polymorphismdoes not alone cause a decrease in Factor VII coagulant levels. ,2001
989,The identification of mutations in one of many large identical repeatedsequences requires special strategies because the detection of the muta tion is hindered by the background of a high number of unchangedsequences. We have applied a brute force approach to detect mutations inthe 5.6 kb Kringle IV type 2 domain of human apolipoprotein(a) which ispresent in 2 up to > 40 almost identical copies in individual alleles and isresponsible for the size polymorphism of the protein. The procedure con sisted of isolation of a single apo(a) allele from a heterozygote by PFGE two independent amplifications by PCR cloning of the amplicons and final ly sequencing of a number (93) of clones high enough to represent bychance most individual repeats. The application of this strategy to anapo(a) allele with 26 K IV 2 repeats yielded the following results i) K IVtypes 2A and 2B were both detected in 74 % of the analyzed clones ii) theratio of 2A 2B was different from the published cDNA sequence iii) anadditional K IV type 2 (designated K IV 2C) was detected in 5 % of theclones iv) in addition different mutations (4 silent 2 nonsense and 5 mis sense ) were detected and v) all mutations were detected in the first exonof the K IV structure and none in the second. The bona fide nature of onenon sense mutation was supported by the finding that the correspondingisoform was smaller than predicted by K IV 2 repeat number and by anindependent PCR procedure based on genomic DNA. These resultsdemonstrate a higher than anticipated sequence heterogeneity in K IV 2 ofapo(a). ,2001
990,Type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis ease. Subclinical atherosclerosis measured as coronary artery calcifica tion (CAC) depends on both genetic and environmental factors. To evalu ate evidence for genetic factors (familial aggregation) contributing to vari ation in CAC we studied 122 type 2 diabetics and 13 nondiabetics (medi an age 59 years range 38 80) in 56 families. CAC was measured by fast gated helical computed tomography. Other measured atherosclerotic riskfactors included blood pressure body size lipids HbA1c and medical his 270 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Geneticstory. Generalized estimating equations were used to test for association between CAC and the risk factors while accounting for underlying correla tion due to family membership. CAC was detectable in 80% of patients withdiabetes (median score = 84 range 0 5776). CAC adjusted for age wasassociated with male gender (p=0.0003) reduced HDL (p=0.02) albumin creatinine ratio (p=0.008) and cigarette pack years (p=0.03). CAC wasassociated with history of angina myocardial infarction stroke and vascu lar procedure (all p<0.005). HbA1c (p=0.14) and fasting glucose (p=0.08)were positively but non significantly associated with CAC. After adjust ment for age sex race and diabetes status CAC was significantly herita ble (h2 = 0.50 p=0.009). In multivariate analysis with additional adjustmentfor HDL BMI hypertension and smoking the residual heritabilityremained significant (h2 = 0.40 p=0.038). These results suggest thatgenetic factors independent of known risk factors for atherosclerosis con tribute to the variance of CAC in type 2 diabetes and that searching forQTLs for CAC will be an important phenotype for mapping genes for ath erosclerosis and type 2 diabetes. ,2001
991,Objective: To distinguish between genetic and environmental explanationsfor high risk of SLE in west Africans compared with Europeans by studyingthe relation of risk to individual admixture. Methods: Cases of SLE and controls were sampled from an admixed pop ulation in Trinidad. The first 63 cases and 90 controls were typed with a setof 26 SNPs chosen to have large frequency differentials between theparental populations (west African European and Native American). Indi vidual admixture was estimated in a Bayesian analysis using Markov chainsimulation. Results: Mean admixture of the population was estimated as 51% westAfrican [95%CI 46% 56%] 31% European [95%CI 27% 36%] and 17%Native American [95%CI 14% 20%]. The estimated proportions with >75%and <25% African ancestry were 27%[ 95%CI 24 34%] and 31%[95%CI25% 37%] respectively. Marker based estimates of individual Africanadmixture correlated [r= 0.86] with estimates based on reported grand parental ancestry which were available for 70% of the sample. The slopeof the relationship of risk ratio for SLE and renal SLE to African admixturewere estimated as 2.3 (95% CI 0.7 7.2) and 3.2 (95% CI 0.5 19.1) respec tively. The confidence interval for these slopes are wide because the cur rent marker set extracts only 23% of the information that we would have ifadmixture were measured accurately. Conclusion: Individual admixture varies widely within Trinidad so that therelationship of disease risk to admixture can be studied but for accurateestimation of this relationship it will be necessary to type more markersinformative for ancestry. ,2001
992,Alzheimer s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which is one of the most common forms of dementia in the age of 65 yearsand older. Diagnosis is based upon evaluation of cognitive skills elimina tion of other dementia associated diseases and cranial CT examination. However definitive diagnosis is proved only by neurohistological findings. The etiology of the disease is unknown and effective treatment is not avail able. Intensive research in the pathomechanism of the disease revealed aconnection between increased frequency of apolipoprotein E4 allele andlate onset of AD. The objective of this study was to characterizeapolipoprotein E polymorphisms in late onset AD patients in Iranian popu lation. Therefor in this study 100 AD patients were examined. The poly morphic area was amplified by PCR subjected to 8% polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. The results shows thatE4 allele was significantly more frequent in both early and late onsetgroups compared to controls ( p<0.001 ). This data indicate that the ApoE4 is also a risk factor for AD in Iranian population. ,2001
993,Blood pressure is a common trait of multifactorial origin. Evidence indi cates that the immune system plays a role in the development of hyper tension in both animal models and humans. Genes for CC chemokinereceptor (CCR) 5 and CCR2 map to human chromosome 3p21.3 within acluster of 350 kb. A 32 bp deletion in the CCR5 gene (CCR5D32) and a G to A point mutation in the CCR2 gene (CCR264I) have been first associat ed to resistance to HIV 1 infection and recently involved in severalimmuno related disorders. In the present study we evaluated allelic distri bution of CCR5 and CCR2 genes in essential hypertension through acase control study. Genotype frequency was compared between a groupof essential hypertensive patients (stage I II n=53) and a group of Cau casian unrelated healthy subjects (n=340). Case selection was made bymeans of strict clinical evaluation and careful laboratory investigation according to international guidelines. Genomic DNA was isolated fromperipheral blood cells and gene polymorphisms were analyzed by poly merase chain reaction (CCR5) and restriction enzyme analysis after ampli fication (CCR2). Chi square analysis and Fisher s exact tests were used tocompare data between cases and controls and test for conformity to theHardy Weinberg equilibrium. A statistically significant difference wasobserved for CCR5 and CCR2 mutant alleles in essential hypertensivepatients in comparison with controls (p<0.01). Both CCR5D32 andCCR264I alleles showed a 0.11 frequency among cases. Genotype distri bution was in equilibrium among cases and controls according to theHardy Weinberg equilibrium. Our results suggest an association betweenpolymorphisms at CCR genes and essential hypertension. ,2001
994,Allelic variants of CBS and MTHFR have been suggested as risk factorsfor NTD. We have demonstrated an increased risk factor for the allele T ofMTHFR in our population. The aim of this study was to assess the pres ence of a 68 bp insertion (68bp ins) in the CBS gene with the developmentof NTD isolated or in association with the mutation C677T in MTHFRgene. We have studied both mutations in a group of 79 Argentine patientswith NTD 78 mothers and 67 fathers. Control group consisted of 105healthy adults and 39 healthy children. DNA from blood samples wasgenotyped by PCR and BsrI and HinfI digestion for CBS or MTHFR respec tively. We found an allelic frequency of 0.05 for the 68bp ins in our popu lation. No statistical differences were found when the presence of the 68bpins in the control group and the affected one were compared (0.11 vs. 0.15 OR= 1.39 95% CI 0.59 3.21 p>0.1). However when comparing the 68bpins in association with the C677T MTHFR mutation with the absence ofboth allelic variants a significant difference was found (0.15 vs. 0.33 p<0.05). A frequency of 0.14 (n=145) for both allelic variants in parents ofaffected children and 0.15 for parents of non affected ones (n=40) wasobserved. Our results suggest that the 68bp ins is not a risk factor for NTDin the studied population unless combined with the thermolabile mutationin MTHFR gene. ,2001
995,Genetic factors can contribute to susceptibility to infectious diseases. TheMannose Binding Protein (MBP) is a seric protein that recognizes patogenmicroorganisms by carbohydrates present on its cell wall. The MBP acts asan opsonic agent inducing the fagocitosis by macrophages. Low concen trations of this protein are considered to be the most common immunode ficiency in humans. In mice natural resistance to intracellular infectious disease is associated to the gene Nramp1. The effects of the human genePosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 271homologue NRAMP1 are not well known yet. In this study we genotyped the gene MBP and the locus D543N of the gene NRAMP1 of 204 leprosypatients and 211 blood donors controlling sample to evaluate the geneseffects on infection or disease development by the Mycobacterium leprae. No significant differences were noticed of the genic and genotypic fre quencies of these systems between the affected group and the normalcontrol neither the haplotypes MBP/NRAMP1 between the different typesof leprosy. Therefore the genetic variations studied do not seem to berelated to susceptibility to leprosy as suggest by some authors in studiesdone on other populations. ,2001
996,Objective To investigate the genetic contribution in a large scale study ofHOA in Iceland using an extensive genealogy database of the Icelandicpopulation. Patients and methods As part of an ongoing study patientswith HOA have been actively registered through nationwide clinical andsurgical registers radiology clinics and ergotherapy centers. At present2950 HOA patients comprising 1% of the Icelandic population have beenregistered through the above channels. The patient phenotypes used aremild and severe finger OA and mild and severe thumb base OA based onclinical and radiological findings. Three methods were used to investigatethe genetic contribution (1) the Minimum Founder Test (MFT) to estimatethe minimum number of ancestors (founders) needed to account for allpatients at various years in the past (2) the average pairwise kinship coef ficient (KC) of the patients and (3) the relative risk of HOA for relatives. Ineach case the results were compared with 1000 control sets of similarcomposition with regard to number age and sex generated from thegenealogy database. Results The MFT indicated that the study group haddescended from fewer ancestors than controls (p<0.001). The KC was sig nificantly higher than in the control sets (p<0.001). The relative risk of HOAfor siblings and parents was higher than in spouses. The KC obtained forpatients with severe finger OA was notably high whereas that for thumbbase OA without finger involvement was not significantly different fromcontrols. Conclusions Patients seeking medical services for HOA aremore related to each other than matched controls supporting the role of agenetic component in the disease. Our methods may also contribute to theunderstanding of the inheritance of different subsets of hand OA. ,2001
997,Objectives: We calculated age adjusted relative risks for different cate gories of relatives of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients from the case regis ter of Central Sardinia (Italy) and examined some covariates that may influ ence the risk in sibs. Background: MS is a multifactorial disease determined by genetic environ mental interactions. A genetic component to MS is indicated by anincreased relative risk in siblings by an increased concordance rate inmonozygotic compared to dizygotic twins by studies from adoptees half siblings and by familial recurrence risk data. Design: Pedigrees were routinely obtained on prevalent patients of the MScase register. As a consequence most of the cases were independentlyascertained. We used life tables techniques to calculate age adjusted recurrence risks. We estimated the effect of the studied covariates by fitting a proportionalhazard model. Results: We included in our analysis 313 probands and a total of 14173 rel atives. The mean size of a pedigree was 47 family members. The age adjusted risk in parents was 1.26 (0.60 2.63) in children 9.44 (9.32 25.25) in sibs 4.76 (3.57 6.32) in second degree relatives 0.71 (0.41 1.21) and in third degree relatives 1.75 (1.24 2.45).The relationship of the studied covariates to the sibling risk was examinedusing Cox proportional hazards model. Sex of the proband and probandonset age were significant. More specifically the hazard ratio for siblingsof a female MS proband compared with a male proband was 0.62 (p=0.05).The risk for siblings of the oldest onset patient was lower than for siblingsof the early onset patients (hazard ratio = 0.50 p=0.023). Conclusion: We report the results of the first population based study in Italyin which recurrence risks are computed within a sufficiently large popula tion to provide figures for patient counselling. Due to the ascertainmentscheme we used where each case is ascertained independently on theothers our study is not likely to be affected by ascertainment bias (familieswith a higher number of MS cases are more likely to be ascertained).The higher risk observed in sibs of the less susceptible sex (male) can beinterpreted as evidence in favour of a liability threshold model for MS. The recurrence risks for different categories of relatives can be used tocounsel patients and their families. Our results agree with those obtained by similar studies. ,2001
998,The pathogenesis of osteoporosis is controlled by genetic and environ mental factors. Although genetic predisposition seems to be a factor in thepathogenesis of osteoporosis the precise cohort of genes that may beinvolved is not well defined. We investigated the association of VDR3 COL1A1 and CALCR genes polymorphism with osteoporosis in twogroups of osteoporosis patients and unrelated controls of north west Rus sia. The first group of patients consisted of 64 women with osteoporosiscomplicated with fractures while the second group (78 women) containedpatients with osteoporosis in postmenopausal (surgical or physiological).The statistical analysis proved preponderance of allele t of Taq I polymor phism in 9 intron of VDR3 in the first group of patients (53 1 %) comparedto the control group (31 1 %)( ?<0.01).The frequency of allele s of Apa Ipolymorphism in a recognition site for the transcription factor Sp1 ofCOL1A1 gene was three times higher in patients (48 4%) compared to thecontrols (16 7%) and this difference appears to be significant (?<0.01). Thefrequency of allele T of Alu I polymorphism in CALCR gene was alsoauthentically higher (?<0.01) in this the group of patients (91 7%)(72 5% incontrol). In the second group of patients we had not elucidated any authen tic differences in frequencies of alleles of these three genes compered tothe control group. The frequencies of alleles of these genes were 33 9%(VDR3) 21 8% (COL1A1) and 77 6% (CALCR). Our date indicate that dif ferent alleles of VDR3 COL1A1 and CALCR genes correlate with severeosteoporosis in women. ,2001
999,Evidence for the genetic factor human natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) gene to have a role in susceptibility totuberculosis was found in West Africans Koreans and Japanese. Theobjective of the study is to investigate whether the polymorphisms in thefour regions of the NRAMP1 gene 5 microsatellite Intron4 D543N and3 UTR are associated with the host susceptibility to tuberculosis amongChinese population in Hong Kong. Polymorphisms in NRAMP1 gene wereinvestigated in a case control study of tuberculosis in Hong Kong China. Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymor phism (PCR RFLP) analysis was used to type the polymorphisms and todetermine the allelic frequencies of the different regions of the gene amongpaitents and controls. Patients suffering from tuberculosis were diagnosedby positive findings in chest X ray and sputum culture while the controlswere healthy blood donors with no history of tuberculosis. Relationship ofthe polymorphisms in the 4 regions of NRAMP1 and the host susceptibili ty to tuberculosis among Chinese population in Hong Kong will be high lighted and discussed. ,2001
1000,Germ line mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to hereditarybreast ovarian cancer syndrome. In Finland 20 different BRCA1/2 muta tions have been identified and 13 of the mutations are founders and272 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Geneticsaccount for the vast majority of Finnish BRCA1/2 families. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in uns elected Finnish ovarian carcinoma patients and to evaluate the relationshipbetween mutation status and personal/family history of cancer. Two hun dred and thirty three patients were screened for all BRCA1/2 mutationsknown in the Finnish population. Additionally a subgroup of patients withpersonal history of breast cancer and/or family history of breast and/orovarian cancer was screened for novel BRCA1/2 mutations. Thirteenpatients (5.6%) had mutations eleven in BRCA1 and two in nan,2001
1001,Prostaglandin H synthase 2 (PTGS2 also known as cyclooxygenase 2) isthought to take part in prevention of colorectal cancer by nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs which are inhibitor of the enzyme. We used DNA het eroduplex analysis to screen the PTGS2 gene for naturally occurringenzyme variants in order to obtain further information on a biochemicalmechanism of prevention. We found a single base substitution in 10% ofAfrican Americans (g.5939T>C GTT>GCT Val511Ala). The amino acidchange is predicted to open a large cavity near the PTGS2 active site andmay change conformations of key residues. No changes in Vmax Km orthermal stability were observed for the mutant enzyme in Cos 1 cell assayswith arachidonic acid as substrate. However the conditions of the assaywere expected to differ substantially from the normal intracellular environ ment. Case control analyses of 380 African Americans from 2 study popu lations showed odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for colorectaladenomas of 0.50 (0.18 1.44) and 0.56 (0.13 2.44) among subjects withthe mutation. The results are potentially consistent with a protective effectof the mutation mimicking nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs. Largersample sizes are needed to confirm. ,2001
1002,Although increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer has beenassociated with genetic mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 risk may also bemodified by lifestyle factors health behaviors environmentalexposures and other genetic components. To provide resources for stud ies of these complex interactions the National Cancer Institute funded theCooperative Family Registry for Breast Cancer Studies [CFRBCS] a con sortium of six international research centers with an Informatics SupportCenter. Family recruitment was initiated in 1997 at the three population based and three clinic based sites. As of December 2000 more than 6 000families including 15 000 individuals are participating. Data and biospeci mens are collected from probands and their relatives using common instru ments and protocols. Coded personal health information dietary intake treatment for breast and/or ovarian cancer and pedigree data are routine ly transmitted to the Informatics Center. Biospecimens including blood andtumor tissue samples are banked at each collaborating site following rigidquality control procedures. Genetic analyses are being conducted cur rently 350 carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 have been identified. The primary purpose of the CFRBCS has been the development of a unique resourcefor interdisciplinary studies of genetic and environmental risk of breast andovarian cancer. Several hypothesis driven research projects are beingconducted by CFRBCS investigators and international collaborators usingthe data and biospecimens additional investigators are encouraged todevelop research proposals for submission to the external Advisory Com mittee. Information about the CFRBCS and application procedures areavailable on the NCI website www dccps.ims.nci.nih.gov/CFRBCS. ,2001
1003,Glutathione S transferases are important xenobiotic metabolizing enzymesand several studies have showed that their genetic polymorphisms maycontribute to individual susceptibility for some cancers. Oral and laryngealcancers are important due to their incidence in several countries. Geneticand environmental factors are involved in the development of these can cers. Many of GST enzymes are involved in the desintoxication of activemetabolites from tobacco smoke what makes them important on modulat ing the susceptibility to tobacco related cancers. As part of a wide case control study conducted in Latin America by the International Agency forResearch on Cancer we studied GSTM1 and GSTT1 genetic polymor phisms in 200 oral and 73 laryngeal cancer patients from Rio de Janeiro(Brasil). Polymorphisms were analyzed in DNA from peripherical bloodextraction by Polymerase Chain Reaction and restriction enzymes diges tion. The null homozygotes frequencies were 45% (GSTM1) and 24%(GSTT1) in oral cancer patients and 44% (GSTM1) and 21% (GSTT1) inlaryngeal cancer group. The observed differences among these frequen cies and the ones from a sample of healthy individuals were not statisticallymeaningful. No associations were observed concerning laryngeal cancerand polymorphisms studied here. However for the GSTM1 polymorphismboth healthy and oral cancer samples were not under the Hardy Weinbergequilibrium (p<.001 and p=.003 respectively). Among healthy controls ithappens due to the excess of AB heterozygotes but in the oral cancergroup this genotype was absent suggesting its protective role in oral can cer in our population.

1004,Mutation data of the p53 gene have relevant prognostic and therapeuticvalue in several types of cancer. We are developing and evaluating anAPEX (Arrayed Primer Extension) based test for the gene with goal ofgetting the full mutation data at both DNA strands in a single assay. Apatient DNA sample is amplified digested enzymatically and annealed toarrayed primers which promote sites for template dependent DNA poly merase extension reactions using four fluorescently labelled dideoxynu cleotides. The GenoramaÃ¢\x80\x9c imaging system and genotyping software are used for imaging and semiautomatic sequence analysis. The p53 genechip is scanning exons 2 to 9 plus two introns from both strands (1218bases). An average of 98 % of the arrayed p53 gene sequence can beanalysed from either sense or antisense strand and 85 % from bothstrands. In best cases the readable sequence is up to 99.8 % and 96 % respectively. Tumour samples with known mutations were analysed in ablind test. Predominantly the results were concordant with TTGE (Tempo ral Temperature Gradient Electrophoresis) plus dideoxy sequencing. Onecase showed the presence of double mutation in codon 290. In addition one heterozygous SNP and an SNP with minor allele were found. Theentire resequencing procedure can be completed in less than six hoursand at 5 to 10 times less cost compared to ABI sequencing per sample. Once fully developed the p53 gene chip should become a medium foraccurate and efficient DNA sequence analysis of this or other frequentlymutated genes. ,2001
1005,In the 17th century about 5 000 immigrants coming mostly from France settled in Canada. Among them 3 500 to 4 000 have descendants in thecontemporary Quebec population and they account for the major part ofthe gene pool of the 5 million Quebecers of French descent. The presentstudy was designed to analyse the role of this founder effect and the result ing population demogenetic structure in the introduction and diffusion ofthe BRCA1 recurrent R1443X mutant allele. The highly conserved haplo type observed in 46 R1443X carriers from 11 French Canadian familiesand generated using seventeen microsatellite markers spanning a 9.3 cMregion surrounding the BRCA1 locus confirms that the R1443X mutation isa founder mutation in the Quebec population. Ascending genealogies ofone carrier individual per family (n=10) and of controls (n=30) were recon structed using the BALSAC population register. These genealogies havean average depth of ten generations but many lineages go as far back as13 generations. We identified the founder couple with the highest proba bility of having introduced the mutation in the population. Genetic contri butions of this founder couple to the contemporary regional populations ofQuebec were measured in order to understand the spread in time andspace of the mutation and to detect the presence of spatial stratification inthe diffusion pattern of the mutation. Finally we also performed haplotyp ing analysis of R1443X carriers from 10 French families and although theresults are consistent with a common origin for this mutant allele in bothpopulations a distinct haplotype was obtained in two French families thussuggesting multiple origins for the R1443X mutation. ,2001
1006,Studies have suggested the role of gene environment interactions onbreast cancer risk since the effects of known risk factors differ accordingto the existence or not of a family history of breast cancer. The recent iden tification of susceptibility genes for hereditary breast cancer provides fur ther insight into the evidence of such interactions. The purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations inearly onset breast cancer cases and to analyse gene environment inter actions. From a population based cohort of women with breast cancerdiagnosed before age 46 years we collected information about environ mental and familial risk factors and blood sample for genetic testing. Weused a case only design to study gene environment interactions. A total of269 women were included and genetic analyses were performed for 232women. Twenty one BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations carriers were identi fied. Mutation prevalence was higher in women with breast cancer beforeage 41 years than the other women (12.8% versus 5.2%). We found a non significant interaction of some reproductive factors an increased breastcancer risk was associated with a late age at menarche (>15 years) (oddratio=2.5 p=0.2) and parity (odd ratio=1.8 p>0.2) in carriers of BRCA1 andBRCA2 mutations. No effect of age at first full term pregnancy and oralcontraception were found. These results indicate a possible interactionbetween BRCA1 and BRCA2 susceptibility genes consistent with the pre vious studies. However they need confirmation with further larger studies. The implications of our findings for the high prevalence of BRCA1 andBRCA2 mutation in women with breast cancer before 41 years will be alsodiscussed. ,2001
1007," ', 'Sequence analysis was carried out of a human clone pBA0.6 generatedafter ExoIII/S1nuclease digestion and subcloning of pCMM86 (GDB 168382 D17S74) which was not available in the database. It revealed thepresence of a reiterating core motif of 24mer GTGGGTGTGTTG GAGGGGGTGAGG present 23 times (Accession no. AF079321) whichwas GC rich and minisatellitic in nature. Genomic blots of HaeIII digestedhuman DNA when hybridized to pBA0.6 generated a ladder of polymor phic bands which were individual specific in nature .The probability of iden tity ranged from 5.07X10 14 to 2.64X10 16 in different population groups. Out of three isomorphic bands of 29.0 kb 2.4 kb 2.1 kb 29.0 kb band wasobserved to be Homo sapiens specific (Saha et al. 2000 DNA and CellBiology vol. 19 no. 4 219 226). Dendrograms based on UPGMA methodwith Jaccard s coefficient values suggested high genetic diversity in all thepopulation groups suggesting that the samples taken were random. Maxi mum likelihood estimates through bootstrap sampling method showed thatPunjabis Bengalis and UPites formed one cluster whereas South Indiansformed a separate cluster altogether thus showing the proximity of thesethree population groups as compared to that from South India. Further withanother minisatellite sequence (Accession no. AF157691) dendrogram atthe individual level led to the formation of several small clusters which wereinterleaved also the subgroups for each of the populations were inter mingled with the subgroups for the other populations (Saha and Bamezai 2000 J Hum Genet vol. 45 207 211). Further pair studies comparing thelymphocyte and tumor DNA of 19 sporadic breast cancer patients indicat ed a genetic variation in 32% of the cases studied pointing towards its util ity in screening for somatic changes in the breast cancer tissues. A prelim inary study of Northern hybridization with pBA0.6 resulted in two tran scripts of 0.63 kb and 0.29 kb. This was further corroborated with RT PCRresults where 2 amplicons matching with the expected size of two readingframes within the minisatellite sequence were obtained. Interestingly amplicons were also generated when tumour samples of breast cancerpatients were analyzed. The role of the two transcripts from the minisatel lite sequence is not clear as yet. ",2001
1008,Folate metabolism is thought to play an important role in carcinogenesisthrough its involvement in both DNA methylation and nucleotide synthesis. A common Ala/Val variant in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene(MTHFR) leads to a mildly disturbed folate metabolism. We previouslyreported that the MTHFR Val/Val genotype was associated with increasedcancer mortality in men aged 85 years and over (Eur J Hum Genet1999 7 197 204). To further explore the deleterious effects of the MTHFRgenotype we studied the association of the genotype with overall cancerrisk and the risk of cancer of specific organs in 860 men aged 65 84 yearswho were followed over 10 years. During follow up 150 new cases of can cer occurred among the 793 men without cancer at baseline. The risk ofcancer was 1.81 fold (95% CI 1.09 3.00) increased among men with theVal/Val genotype as compared to men with the Ala/Ala genotype. Thehigher incidence of cancer could be attributed to an increased risk of can cer of the prostate (RR 3.48 95% CI 1.05 11.6) the colorectum (RR 3.65 95% CI 1.07 12.5) and the kidney and bladder (RR 5.48 95% CI 1.67 18.0) but not to an increased risk of lung cancer. The risk of cancerappeared to be particularly increased among men with lower folate intake higher alcohol consumption and of an older age. In conclusion our currentand previous studies in two independent populations indicate that a com mon Ala/Val variant in the MTHFR gene may have a deleterious effect onthe risk of cancer in the general population. ,2001
1009,Thiopurine methyltransferase is a polymorphic enzyme that catalyses theS methylation of thiopurine drugs used in immunosupressive and anti cancerigenous therapy. Therefore characterisation of all the variation atTPMT gene which can produce changes in TPMT activity should be con ducted. We set out to perform genotype phenotype correlation analysis in143 Portuguese individuals for several TPMT SNPs (including silent andintronic substitutions) and for a VNTR located in the promoter region of thegene. The SNPs and the VNTR were studied by PCR based methods andthe phenotype quantification of TPMT was performed using a HPLCmethod. As expected a statistical significant association was foundbetween the presence of TPMT mutant alleles and reduced TPMT activity. For the other silent or intronic substitutions analysed no signs that theycould influence TPMT activity were detected. The VNTR at the promoterregion is characterised by a composite internal structure due to the pres ence of 3 different types of repeats A B and C. Therefore each VNTRallele is defined by a particular pattern of repeat arrangement. We found astatistical significant association between VNTR*6 and reduced levels ofTPMT activity. Since VNTR*6 is the allele with more B type repeats we canhyphotesize that the high number of B repeats is the responsible for theassociation registered. However the question needs further support. Final ly we reported linkage disequilibrium between VNTR*6 and TPMT*3A andbetween VNTR*4 and TPMT*2. ,2001
1010,We have investigated a number of common polymorphisms in both BRCA1and 2 for an association with low penetrance breast and ovarian cancersusceptibility. Two of the most common variants in BRCA1 (P871L andQ356R) and six variants in BRCA2 (a 26g N289H N372H T1915M R2034C and K3326X) have been studied in population based series of~2000 breast cancer cases from the ABC study 500 ovarian cancer casesand 1500 controls from the EPIC cohort. We have found a significantincrease in risk of breast cancer associated with the BRCA2 N372H poly morphism (OR=1.3 [95%CIs 1.07 1.61]) The BRCA1 polymorphismsshow no association with breast cancer risk. We have also observed a sig nificant deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in adult femalesfor both the BRCA2 N372H and BRCA1 P871L polymorphisms with adeficit of homozygotes and an excess of heterozygotes for both variants (p<0.01). In a set of ~2400 new born individuals new born girls alsoshowed a deficit of homozygotes and an excess of heterozygotes for bothgenes consistent with the adult females. The new born boys however showed the opposite effect with an excess of homozygotes which wassignificant in BRCA2 (p=0.001). This suggests that common variants ofBRCA1 and 2 are subject to selection which appear to affect foetal sur vival in a sex dependent manner. ,2001
1011,Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting womenin the UK. Recent evidence has highlighted the importance of nutrition inthe aetiology of breast cancer. In particular diets with higher intakes of fruitand vegetables are considered protective. Vegetables are a major sourceof dietary folate which is involved in DNA synthesis and methylation. Anassociation between higher folate intake and reduced risk of breast cancerhas been observed. Functional polymorphisms in MTHFR an enzymeinvolved in folate metabolism have been reported (C677T and A1298C).We undertook a case control study to investigate associations betweenbreast cancer dietary folate and MTHFR polymorphisms. Sixty five breastcancer cases were recruited at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Age sexmatched controls (without breast cancer) were selected from general prac titioner registers. Subjects completed a food frequency questionnaire andprovided a mouthwash sample to enable MTHFR genotyping. A trend ofdecreasing breast cancer risk with increasing dietary folate intake wasobserved (OR=0.49 95% CI 0.2 1.2). For the C677T polymorphism theTT genotype had a protective effect (OR=0.38 95% CI 0.12 1.24). A simi lar protective effect was observed for women with the CC genotype for theA1298C polymorphism (OR=0.24 95% CI 0.06 0.97). A significant protec tive effect was observed for women with homozygosity for the A1298Cvariant only with higher folate intake (OR=0.09 95% CI 0.01 0.82).A1298C homozygote individuals with high folate intake appear to have thestrongest protective effect against breast cancer. Both dietary and geneticvariation in folate status may be implicated in the pathogenesis of breastcancer. ,2001
1012,In the sample of 214 children with leukemia(ALL acute lymphoblasticN=163 ANLL acute nonlymphoblastic N=43 and HGL chronic granulociteleukema N=8)the frequencies of ABO and Rh blood types were similar tothe average value of the Serbian population. Comparation of the frequen cies of ABO blood types between samle of affected individuals with ALLand control sample we can see that O blood type is slightly increased andA B and AB blood types are slightly decreased. But in the sample ofaffected children with ANLL the frequencies of A O and AB blood types areslightly increased and B blood type is statisticaly decreased (X2=3.8 p<0.05)compared with incidence of ABO blood groups in Serbian popula tion. If we compared frequencies of ABO blood groups between affectedchildren of ALL and ANLL we can see that percentages are similar for A Oand AB blood types but frequences of blood type B is statisticalydecreased in the groop of ANLL affected (X2=3.9 p<0.05). Taking all thisinto account we may conclude that most frequently affected individuals inwhole sample and group of ALL are with blood types O A B AB. But in thesample of ANLL the most affected children are with blood types in thisorder A O B=AB. ,2001
1013,Oral and laryngeal cancers are responsible for about 7% of new cancercases worldwide. Many studies have provided evidences of their associa tion with tobacco and alcohol intake while others suggest the role ofPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 275genetic factors contributing to carcinogenesis. Polycyclic aromatic hydro carbons (PAH) and other chemicals present on tobacco smoke and envi ronmental pollutants are submitted to a biotransformation process. Its firstpart is mostly attributed to P450 superfamily enzymes which function is totransform these chemicals into intermediates that will be metabolized byother enzymes into the excretion way. The disability to eliminate toxic prod ucts due to an enzymatic deficiency may contribute to individual risk forchemical induced carcinogenesis. Enzymes encoded by polymorphicCYP1A1 and CYP2E1 genes were previously associated with oral esoph agus and lung cancer. In this case control study we genotyped 277patients with oral and laryngeal cancer and 200 healthy controls from Riode Janeiro (Brasil) in order to compare genotypic and allelic frequenciesbetween the groups. Using Polymerase Chain Reaction and restrictionenzymes techniques we analyzed this sample which is part of a greaterstudy coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The observed allelic frequencies between cases and controls were similarfor CYP2E1 polymorphism and we found no association with the cancersstudied. However the CYP1A1 polymorphism seems to be associated withan increased risk for oral cancer as this group had twice more mutanthomozygotes (GG) than the control one although the allelic frequencieswere similar between them.

1014,Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive dis ease among Caucasians. It is caused by defects in the CF transmembranecounductance regulator (CFTR) gene. More then 900 molecular defectshave been reported to date. The distribution of these mutations is modifyamong different human populations. Fifty five patients with CF fromBashkortostan were tested for mutation delF508. We have analyzed 110unrelated CF chromosomes (53 Slavians 39 Tatars 12 Bashkirs 4 Chuvashes 2 Udmurts). The common mutation delF508 was found onlyon 31 8% of tested CF chromosomes 30 were homozygous and 5 werecompound heterozygous. It is one of the lowest incidence of this deletionreported in Russia. Taking into account that CF patients from Bashkor tostan characterised by high ethnical heterogeneous we have analyzedfrequency of delF508 in different ethnical groups of CF patients. AmongSlavians probands (Russians Ukrainians Belorussians) delF508 wasdetected on 45% CF chromosomes among Tatars on 28% and amongBashkirs Chuvashes Udmurts delF508 was not found. We suppose thatthe absence of delF508 in Bashkirs CF families could be explained by thefeatures of formation of this population resulting from mixing of differentethnical components (Turkic Mongolian and probably Finno Ugric andIndo European). By the data of archeology and anthropology the Turkicand Mongolian components in Bashkirs gene pool is highest among otherinvestigated populations. The delF508 practically does not meet in Turkicand Mongolian populations. So our results showed the little portion of Sla vians component in Bashkirs gene pool. ,2001
1015,CFTR gene mutation Ã\x98F508 is the most frequent cystic fibrosis (CF) muta tion accounting for 70% of CF chromosomes. Strong linkage disequilibri um found between Ã\x98F508 and different polymorphic DNA markers havesubstantiated the hypothesis of a single origin of this mutation. The aimsof our study were 1) to characterize the prevalence of mutation Ã\x98F508among normal and CF chromosomes 2)to estimate the age and origin ofthe Ã\x98F508 mutation in Latvia. 31 CF patients 30 their healthy family mem bers and 136 healthy unrelated Latvians were subjected to analysis ofmutation Ã\x98F508 three extragenic and three intragenic polymorphic DNAmarkers. The Ã\x98F508 allele frequency in the overall CF patient populationwas 59.7%.An average incidence of Ã\x98F508 mutation carriers amonghealthy Latvians was 1 42.Absolute linkage disequilibrium was foundbetween Ã\x98F508 and loci IVS6a and XV 2c highly significant betweenÃ\x98F508 and loci TUB18 and KM 19.The results of extended haplotype analysis showed different distribution of haplotypes betweennormal Ã\x98F508 and non Ã\x98F508 CF chromosomes. These results are con sistent with the data published for most European populations and con firms the hypothesis that the Ã\x98F508 mutation has derived from a singlemutational event. Taking into consideration the values of recombinationrates between Ã\x98F508 and extragenic polymorphic markers the estimate ofthe number of generations elapsed since the mutation Ã\x98F508 was firstintroduced into Latvia approximates 101 (2020 years).These data are incontrast with those published for other populations. ,2001
1016,It is widely accepted that a heterozygote advantage must be operating tomaintain a carrier frequency of 1 in 25 associated with the 1 in 2500 inci dence children born with cystic fibrosis. This could operating prenatally through meiotic drive after birth or both. We have explored meiotic driveby counting the number of carriers born to couples where only one parentis a carrier proven on DNA testing and the partner negative. In 519 off spring born to such couples 313 have been found to be carriers instead ofthe expected 259 (chi squared =11.4 p<0.01. This phenomenon is seenmost strongly in female offspring born to female carriers. Implications andpossible mechanisms will be discussed. ,2001
1017,Purpose The development of thrombotic disorders in humans is one of themost common causes of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. Therisk of venous thrombosis is increased in individuals who carry specificgenetic abnormalities in blood coagulation proteins. The FV Leiden andprothrombin G20210A mutations are the most prevalent genetic defectswhich increase risk of venous thrombosis. Their allelic frequencies in Cau casian populations vary between 1 and 8% and 0.35 and 2% respective ly. For Yugoslav population there are no data for either one. Purpose of thisstudy was to establish the prevalence of the FV Leiden and prothrombinG20210A mutations in normal and thrombophilic subjects inYugoslavia. Methods and matherials A study was carried in a group of 100 unrelatedblood donors and in 87 unrelated thrombophilic patients. Criteria for selec tion of patients for this study were the occurrence of the first episode ofthrombosis at the age below 50 years and at least one clinical feature ofthe inherited thrombophilia. FV Leiden and prothrombin G20210A muta tions were detected by polymerase chain reaction followed by digestionwith allele specific restriction enzymes. Normal and mutated genes weredistinguished by the sizes of the restriction fragments. Results In 100 con trol subjects 4 carriers of FV Leiden and 3 carriers of prothrombinG20210A mutations were detected wich gives the frequencies of mutatedalleles 2% and 1.5% respectively. Among 87 trombophilic patients the fre quencies of mutated alleles were higher. For FV Leiden mutation 23 car riers (21 heterozygous and 2 homozygous) were detected giving the allel ic frequency of 14%. For prothrombin G20210A mutation 8 heterozygoticcarriers were discovered i.e. the allelic frequency of 4.5%. Conclusions The frequencies of FV Leiden and Prothrombin G20210A mutations in ourpopulation are within the range for general Cucasian populations. Theprevalences of these mutations in thrombophilic patients show the usualhigher frequencies than in control. ,2001
1018,Since Huntington disease (HD) mutation was identified a direct molecular276 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Geneticstest has become an integral part of diagnosis of the disease. The aim of our study was to find out the relationship between number of CAG repeatsin IT 15 gene and some phenotype signs of disease in Slovak HuntingtonÃ¢\x80\x98spatients. Since molecular test has been available in our country diagnosticpositive molecular test has been confirmed in 63 individuals. In accordancewith the range of mutation these individuals were divided into 3 groups I. With the number of CAG repeats 40 45 II. 46 50 III. over 50 Themajority of our patients belong to the group I. The mean age at onset HDin this group was 40 years (with the range 20 59 years). The less patientsbelong to the group III with the mean age at onset of disease 22 years (withthe range 15 29 years). Except the relationship between the size of muta tion and the age of onset HD we have found also the relationship betweenthe mutation and the first observed symptoms of the disease. While in theI. and II. group majority of patients showed neurological symptoms at theonset of the disease in the III. group that were the changes in behavior andcognition. Our study was the first study of the Slovak HuntingtonÃ¢\x80\x98s popula tion. We confirmed correlation of the size of mutation in HD gene with theage at onset disease and with some of the clinical symptoms of the dis ease. ,2001
1019,Introduction The most common lens defect in the neonate is cataract. Itmay occur as an isolated defect or it may be associated with other ocularor systemic abnormalities. Cataract may be inherited or sporadic. Themost common type of inheritance is autosomal dominant autosomalrecessive inheritance occurs less frequently and it is sometimes found inpopulations with high rates of consanguinity. Objective The study of con genital cataract in an isolate in order to identify the aetiology the type ofinheritance and the genetic and clinical characteristics. Material andmethod The study group comprises an isolate population of approx. 200individuals with 8 cases of congenital cataract identified so far. The pedi gree segregation study and the probability calculation using the Bayes for mula have been accomplished for each family. Results Endogamy in thisisolate is of 80%. The consanguinity coefficient of the population formingthe isolate is 0.004373 and the frequency of consanguineous marriages isof 20%. Congenital cataract has been noticed in 8 patients of 4 siblings which yields a prevalence of the disease of 7.4% inside the isolate (1/14).The calculated risk for the 4 families varies between 1/513 and 1/5. Thefrequency of heterozygous carriers is 32%. The chances of maintaining thefrequency of the disease in the isolate and particularities of genetic coun selling in this case are discussed. Conclusions Congenital cataract usu ally rare can reach an unusually high incidence in isolates. Its studybecomes more interesting today as isolates are disappearing. ,2001
1020,Backgorund The population history of Finland with regions of old (around2000 years ago) and new (about 500 years ago by a small number offounders) settlement has created an unique model to study genetic disor ders on the basis of their geographical distribution across the country. Left right axis abnormalities constitute a clinically well defined but geneticallyheterogeneous disorder manifesting as congenital defects in the sided ness of the heart great vessels bronchi spleen liver and intestine. Objec tive To determine whether left right axis abnormalities in Finland occurmore frequently within the new founder settlement than the old settlement. Methods The database of the Helsinki University Central Hospital wassearched for suggestive diagnoses which were confirmed by chart review. In Finland almost all patients having left right axis abnormalities with car diovascular malformations are evaluated in this hospital. To exclude theeffect of modern migration the birthplaces of the patients grandparents collected from population records were analysed. Results 42 patientswere found among them 2 sibpairs (total number of siblings 131). Anexcess 94 (59%) of the grandparents was born in provinces correspon ding to the region of new settlement which comprise of 37% of the Finnish population in the 1930s (khi square = 15.4 p < 0.001). Clustering of thegrandparents birthplaces with in a few smaller areas was also observed. Conclusions Founder mutation(s) predisposing to left right asymmetryabnormalities are likely to be present in the region of new settlement of Fin land. Given the small number of sibpairs found a complex inheritance pat tern is more likely than monogenic. ,2001
1021,It is considered that in many cases the frequency of alleles with tandemtrinucleitide repeat number more than 20 correlates with prevalence of cor responding expansion diseases in population. We studied distributions ofCAG/CTG repeat alleles of DMPK and IT 15 genes in four populations North West Russia (St Petersburg) Moldavians Georgians and Uzbeks. The frequencies of more than 20 CTG repeat alleles were in a good cor relation with prevalence of MD in Russians Uzbeks and Europeans (liter ature data). There weren t a statistically significant differences between fre quencies of IT 15 gene alleles with more then 20 CAG repeats in Russiansand in Uzbeks compared to East England (Rubisztein et al. 1994). HD isthe most common in England 2 5 times more rare in Russia and practicallyabsent in Uzbeks. We also compared the distributions of long normalCAG/CTG repeat alleles of IT 15 and DMPK genes in many populations. In some populations there weren t alleles with more then 16 17 CTG repeats in DMPK gene. In IT 15 gene alleles with 20 22 CAG repeats werecommon in all populations while longer alleles were represented only inpart of them. Taken together these facts indicate that the alleles groupswhich are a reservoir for de novo mutations could differ in their repeatsnumber in two genes. According to our suggestion the threshold valuebetween stable alleles and alleles predisposed to expansion is 17 18repeats for DMPK gene and 22 23 repeats for IT 15. ,2001
1022,We have studied the incidence and prevalence of monogenic disorders in100000 inhabitants of native population of Yakutia situated at nothern eastpart of Siberia. The maximal morbidity rate of autosomal dominant (AD)diseases was defined for eastern Yakutian subpopulations (2.4 x 10 3) andminimal Ã¢\x80\x94 for western subpopulations (1.4 x 10 3). The values of morbidi ty rate of autosomal recessive (AR) diseases ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 x 10 3. The mean values of morbidity rate of mendelian diseases for Yakutianpopulation were 1.7 x 10 3 for AD 0.7 x 10 3 for AR and 0.4 x 10 3 for X linked diseases. The total morbidity rate of monogenic diseases is 2.8 per1000 person. In Yakutian population we observed a high frequency of spin iocerebellar ataxia I (SCA1 MIM 164400) dystrophia myotonica (DM MIM 160900) and methemoglobinemia (NadH Cytochrome b5 Reductasedeficiency MIM 250800). The study of hereditary diseases will give us theopportunity to create a prophylactic register of hereditary diseases andcome to the prospective medico genetic consultations. ,2001
1023,Essential hypertension is considered to be a multifactorial disease that isinfluenced not only by environmental factors but also by genetic factors. Alterations of lipid metabolism in plasma have been reported to be relatedto an increased risk of essential hypertension. The purpose of this studywas to estimate haplotype frequencies of apolipoprotein B(apo B) gene inKorean population and investigate the relationship between haplotypes ofthis gene and essential hypertension. In order to estimate the haplotypefrequencies Pvu II Xba I and Eco RI RFLPs of apo B gene were used asgenetic marker. There were no significant differences in allele genotype orhaplotype frequencies between normotensives and essential hyperten sives. However Xba I and Pvu II RFLPs of apo B gene were significantlyassociated with plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in essentialhypertensive groups respectively(P<0.05). Therefore our result suggestPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 277that these two RFLPs of apo B gene may be genetic components of car diovascular risk factors in Korean essential hypertensives. ,2001
1024,We report preliminary data concerning 28 LGMD2A patients from Croatia spopulation of 4 8 million people. Sequence analysis of patients from sixapparently non related families from a small rural community revealedhomozygocity for a 550delA. Analysis of additional 4 families from differentparts of the country revealed homozygous 550delA patients in two families compound heterozygotes 550delA / Y537X in one family and compoundheterozygotes for a 550delA /one unknown mutation. These results moti vated us to develop rapid screening method for 550delA. The fact that550delA creates restriction site for Bsa AI enzyme was used to distinguishwild type PCR product (210bp) unchanged after the incubation with theenzyme from mutated type (cut in two bands of 120 and 90 bp). Applica tion of this method on 28 patients from 18 families permitted us to identify homozygous 550delA patients in 8/18 families compound heterozygotes550delA in 7/18 families. Second mutated allele is not identified in 4 fami lies. In five typical LGMD2A patients from 2 families both alleles areunknown. In conclusion our preliminary study shows that 550delA mutationaccounts for 63 8 %( 23/36) of CANP3 chromosomes. ,2001

1026,Phenylketonuria (PKU) the most severe form of hyperphenylalaninaemia(HPA) has an incidence in the Republic of Ireland of approximately 1 in4 500 live births. The purpose of this study was to investigate the HPAmutation spectrum in the Republic to determine mutation haplotype asso ciations and to investigate genotype phenotype correlations. Mutationalanalysis was carried out on a cohort of 279 unrelated hyperphenylalani naemic patients (558 independent alleles) by standard methods. Mutationswere detected in 92% of alleles revealing a total of 29 mutations. A largeproportion of alleles (63.6%) were accounted for by three mutations R408W (41.0%) F39L (12.1%) and I65T (10.1%). The predominant haplo type associations for these common mutations were R408W 1.8 242 F39L 1.8 238 and I65T 1.8 246. The R408W 1.8 mutation exhibits an Eastto West gradient of increasing relative frequency across Europe peaking inIreland. Our data demonstrates that this gradient continues across Irelandand peaks in Connacht the most Westerly province. Combining our datawith that from Northern Ireland (Zschocke et al. Am J Hum Genet 1995 57 1311 1317) we have produced a merged data set for the island of Ire land. Our analysis of this data concurs with previous suggestions that theEnglish contribution to the Irish genepool was small and that gene flowbetween Ireland and Scandinavia was unidirectional. It further demon strates that the province of Ulster has been a zone of population admixturebetween Ireland and Scotland. ,2001
1027,Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited metabolic disease witha dominant mode of inheritance. It is quite common in most human popu lations (1 500) and results in drastical reduction of low density lipoprotein(LDL) catabolism followed by premature coronary heart disease (CAD).The disease is caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene. In order todevelop presymptomatic diagnostic tools for management of the FH weaimed to study the LDL receptor gene mutation spectrum in St. Petersburg(Russia). We have created a DNA bank from 100 unrelated patients withclinical picture of FH. Separate exons of the receptor gene were amplifiedby polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened for presence of themutations via combined single strand conformation polymorphism het eroduplex analysis (SSCP HA). The fragments showing shifted mobility inpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were sequenced by method of Sanger. Up to date we have identified six mutations C74X 347delGCC ?130? ?146R C188Y G578E all of them besides C74X were novel. Rapid meth ods for mutation detection were developed. Cosegregation of mutationsand high cholesterol levels proves the role of mutations in disease devel opment. St. Petersburg population was found to be polymorphic in manypostions of the LDL receptor gene 447 ?/? 750C/T 1170A/G 1413 G/A 1545 ?/? 1773 T/C 2177 C/T 2231 G/A (exons 4 5 8 10 10 12 15 15correspondingly).

1028,"MTHFR encodes a critical enzyme in folate and homocysteine metabolism. The C677T allele of the MTHFR gene is reportedly common in some pop ulations and has been associated with an increased risk for spina bifidaand for adult cardiovascular diseases. Although many reports the C677Tprevalence are available few were based on well defined populations. Wereport data from 12 countries in Europe (Finland France Hungary Italy Netherlands Spain) Israel Russia China and the Americas (Canada Alberta United States Georgia Mexico). We attempted to sample popula tions that were well defined our approaches included using newborn bloodspots from specific geographic areas or from consecutive liveborn babiesfrom hospitals. Typically these populations were also under birth defectmonitoring. We found a high prevalence of C677T homozygotes in Mexico(32%) Northern China (20%) and Southern Italy (20% in Catania 26% inCampania). Such prevalence was intermediate in Northern Italy France and Spain (15 13 and 12% respectively) and it was low in Finland theNetherlands and Russia (4 6 and 7% respectively). In the sample fromthe United States (Georgia) we noted racial variations prevalence washigh among Hispanics (18 percent) low among African Americans (3 per cent) and intermediate among Whites (11 percent). These findings under score the geographical and racial variability of the C677T variant. Suchdata should be useful to better design studies of gene environment inter actions involving the MTHFR gene as well as for future applications inpopulation based prevention of conditions related to such gene. 278 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population GeneticsP0914.

A G749 to T change resulting in the substitution ofGlycine250 to valine was recently identified by us in 41% of the TSD car riers (24/58). We now report an additional novel mutation a C1351 to Gtransversion resulting in a change of Leucine451 to valine in 29% (17/58)of IJ carriers. Neither of the mutations was found in 100 non carriers of thesame ethnic group. Haplotype analysis was conducted using 6 markersclosely linked to the HEXA gene. Mutation G749 to T was associated withallele #1 of D15S131 in 70% of heterozygotes compared with 10% in eth nically matched controls (chi square=46.9 p=10 5) and with allele #2 ofD15S1025 in 68% of heterozygotes compared with 43% in controls (chisquare=4.4 p=0.03). The calculated linkage disequilibrium was 0.66 and0.44 respectively. Mutation C1351 to G was also associated with allele #1of D15S131 (chi square=7.0 p=0.008) yielding a linkage disequilibrium of0.3 yet no significant linkage was found with D15S1025. These resultssuggest a possible common ancestor for each of the HEXA mutations inIraqi heterozygotes. The C1351 to G mutation had probably occurred ear lier than G749 to T as it shows less association with the adjacent markers. Since these mutations have not been documented in Ashkenazi Jewishcarriers they were probably introduced after the 70 AD Exile. ",2001
1029,Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autossomal recessive chronic disease mappedto 7q31 q32. Lung disease accounts for ~95% of its morbidity and mortal ity. The lungs of CF patients are compromised by persistent bacterial infec tion from early age. Of the congenital disorders CF is one of the most com mon with ~1 in 2000 Caucasians affected with carrier frequency as highas one in 25 in Caucasians of northern European ancestry. There wasample motivation to investigate the notification of CF as primary cause ofdeath in South and Southeast Brazil since these regions have a multira cial mixed population including Caucasians from European origin. Ourhypothesis was that there was under estimation of deaths from CF sincethe disease has not been currently recognised mainly in the inland parts ofthe country. CF symptoms such as pulmonary infection and diarrhoea aswell as malnutrition (caused by lack of pancreatic enzymes secretion) arealso common causes of death of non CF infants in Brazil. Our data wereextracted from the Brazilian CD rom entitled Sistema de informacao sobremortalidade/1979 1997 which contained data of all death declarations ofthe country. The frequencies of CF death notifications per 100 000 inhabi tants per year for Brazil and for each south or southeast state were calcu lated for comparison. Chi square test was performed by comparing the val ues of each state against that of Brazil and of Sao Paulo(SP) the moredeveloped state. Our results may indicate that SP has a more precise noti fication of CF as primary cause of death than other states of Brazil ,2001
1030,Studies of allele frequencies of three microsatellite markers revealed fewnew alleles of each marker in Polish population. All new alleles are veryrare. The number and frequency of alleles are similar for Polish and Cau casian population. Only one discrepancy occurred between our studiesand previous data and it concerned size of the most common allele of theDMD(CA)5 II marker. The three markers were run in a multiplex reaction todetermine carrier status for sisters of affected child from 36 DMD/BMDfamilies. In two families carrier analysis concerned an aunt of an affectedchild and in one case a cousin. At least one marker was informative in allstudied families. All three markers were informative in seven families. In seven cases deletion of the DMD(CA)45int marker in affected childrenoccurred. It gave possibility of direct identification of mutations in femalerelatives. Additionally direct carrier detection was possible in one familywith large deletion including the DMD(CA)5 II marker. However in order todistinguish homozygous and hemizygous females DNA samples of bothparents are necessary. Three cases of homo /hemizygous motheroccurred in our investigation. Unfortunately grandparents DNAs were notavailable and in these cases carrier status of mothers was not determined. Direct approach failed also in two families in which both mother and fatherhad the same allele and it was impossible to estimate whether a sister ishomo or hemizygous. New mutations were observed in seven families. Infour of them deletion of marker occurred in an affected child while motherwas heterozygous. In three other cases the same haplotype occurred in anaffected child and a healthy brother. Additionally seven cases of intragenicrecombination events were detected. Five of them occurred in DNAobtained from sisters. Only two markers were informative in all thesecases so it was impossible to determine which marker is linked with amutation. ,2001
1031,The (AC) repeats are been found in the human genomic very frequently. Some of them are related with pathologies. The (AC)n of 5 beta globingene end was studied in normal Mexican population. We founded threealleles. The first A was the most common B was intermidiat frequency andC only in Pur pecha and Mestizo population was found . Now we reportedits relation with sicle cell anemia of Mexican patients. The allele B it wasfound more frequente in beta S mutation. Moreover two news alleles thereare in the Mestizo Mexican population studied that have high African com ponent. This finding are useful for better knowling of this human group. ,2001
1032,Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is a rare genetically heterogeneous (>6loci) recessive disorder characterized by dysmorphic extremities retinaldystrophy obesity male hypogenitalism and renal disease. We have iden tified 22 families with BBS in Newfoundland 17 of whom participated in agenetic linkage study. A founder effect was associated with BBS1 in 5 fam ilies 2 families have BBS2 and 1 is linked to nan,2001
1033,The Newfoundland population is ideal for examining founder effects andfor studying the incidence of hereditary disease in what is essentially aclosed community. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease(ADPKD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans. Muta Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 279tions in any one of at least two different genes are thought to be responsi ble for this disease and two genes PKD1 and PKD2 have been mappedto 16p13.3 and 4q21 23 respectively. Fifteen Newfoundland families withADPKD have been examined using microsatellite markers flanking andwithin the PKD genes on chromosome 16 and chromosome 4. Eight of thefifteen families showed linkage to PKD1 whereas four were linked to nan,2001
1034,Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessivegenetic disorder in Caucasians. Hemochromatosis is characterized byincreased gastrointestinal iron absorbtion in excessive uptake and persis tant accumulation of iron in the body. Classical symptoms of hemochro matosis include liver disease diabetes mellitus myocardiopathy arthral gia skin siderosis. The gene of hemochromatosis HFE is located on theshort arm of the chromosome 6 telomeric to major histicompatibility com plex. A single missence mutation C282Y is responsible for hemochro matosis in approximately 80% of all cases. C282Y frequencies of 1 10 %are observed in Europeans. We analysed the frequency of the C282Y in260 individuals with Slavic origin from three Ukranian regions (West Cen tral East) and in 100 individuals from isolated Crimean tartars. Frequen cy of C282Y mutation in different regions of Ukraine ranged from 2% to3% frequency of this mutation in pooled Ukrainians was 2 5% and inCrimean tartars was 1%. The high prevalence of the C282Y mutation inUkraine suggests that population screening for the C282Y mutation couldbe highly advantageous in terms of preventive health care. ,2001
1035,Since the identification of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductanceregulator (CFTR) gene more than 900 mutations responsible for CF havebeen described. Involvement of CFTR gene mutations has also been con firmed in otherwise healthy but infertile men with obstructive azoospermiafrom congenital bilateral or unilateral absence of vas deference and epi didymal or ejaculatory duct obstruction. The aim of the study was to iden tify the spectrum of CFTR gene mutations in CF patients and in infertilemen with azoospermia and oligozoospermia in Estonia. Thirty families withCF patients were studied. All 27 exons and their flanking sequences werescanned by SSCP and DGGE analyses. Two CFTR gene mutations werefound to be common in Estonia Ã\x98F508 in 31 (51.7%) alleles and 394delTTin 8 (13.3%) alleles. Eight rare mutations were detected all described ear lier in other populations. We did not find any of the mutations more com mon in the European populations like G542X(2.6%) N1303K(1.6%) G551D(1.5%) or W1282X(1.0%). In conclusion about 80% of mutationswere identified in CF patients. The study group of men with fertility prob lems included 20 individuals with obstructive and 29 individuals withnonobstructive azoospermia and 107 men with severe oligozoospermia. Patients were tested for three CF mutations Ã\x98F508 394delTT R117H anda IVS8 T variant. The patients with obstructive azoospermia were addi tionally tested for more mutations by INNO/LipaTMCFTR12 andINNO/LipaTMCFTR17+Tn kits. In the result of these tests only Ã\x98F508mutation and 5T allele were revealed. We identified two heterozygotesÃ\x98F508/5T and two heterozygotes with 5T allele in one chromosome in obstructive azoospermia group. One compound heterozygoteÃ\x98F508/P508C one 5T homozygote and one patient with only one 5T allele were detected in nonobstructive azoospermia group. Among the oligo zoospermic men 14 patients revealed 5T in one allele and one carriedÃ\x98F508 muation on one chromosome. In comparison with the control groupof normal men the frequency of Ã\x98F508 mutation and 5T allele was con siderably higher only in patients with obstructive azoospermia 5% versus0 6% for Ã\x98F508 and 10% versus 4 2% for 5T. Therefore CFTR gene muta tion screening and genetic counselling should be recommended to maleswith obstructive azoospermia and there partners to reduce there risk for CFchild by assisted reproduction procedures. ,2001
1036,Objective The study s objective was to evaluate association betweenhereditary coagulation abnormalities including factor V Leiden and pro thrombin G20210A and obstetrical complicalitions such as preeclampsia abruptio placentae intrauterine fetal growth retardation (IUFGR)and still birth in Turkish population. Material and Methods DNA was extracted fromwhole blood of 84 women 42 complicated pregnancies and 42 controlcases. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify exon 10 of fac tor V gene and untranslated end of prothrombin gene followed by enzy matic digestion with Mnl I and Hind III for mutation detection respectively. Results The mutation at nucleotide 1691 in factor V gene was detected in8 of the women with obstetrical complication and in 3 of the women withnormal pregnancies (19% and 7.1% respectively p<0.005). This mutationwas detected 5 of the 28 women who had preeclampsia (17.9% p<0.005) 2 of the 5 women who had stillbirth (40%) and 1 of the 7 pregnant womenwho had IUFGR (14%). Prothrombin G20210A polimorphism detectionresults under evaluation. Conclusions The Leiden mutation is relativelycommon in pregnant women with preeclampsia. Although the mutationwas detected in women who had stillbirth and IUFGR the number of sub ject is not meaningful for statistical evaluation. It is suggested that factor VLeiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation detection screening can beused for pregnant women under risk. ,2001
1037,We have demonstrated a significant association between early onsetAlzheimer s disease (EOAD) and an allele in the promotor of presenilin 1(PSEN1) significantly decreasing PSEN1 expression in vitro. For late onsetAlzheimer s disease (LOAD) numerous studies have reported inconsistentassociations with a polymorphism in intron 8 of nan,2001
1038,The beta thalassemia is an autosomal ressesive genetic disease caused280 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Geneticsby a loss in activity in one or both alleles of the beta globin gene. The beta thalassemia is well known as one of the major genetic disease in tenprovinces located in north and south of Iran. It has been estimated thatmore than 3000000 gene carriers exist in these regions. The present studyhas been focused on beta thalassemia in Chaharmahal Bakhtiary provincelocated in south of Iran. Hardy Weinberg principle was utilized in order todetermine the genotype and gene frequencies and estimation of the per centage of homozygote and heterozygote carriers in this population. Thefrequency of all the affected genes (q)and normal gene (p)were estimatedas 0.016 and 0.984 respectively. The frequency of the number of peopleexpected to be homozygous normal heterozygous carriers (minor tha lassemic) and homozygous affected (major thalassemic) were determinedas p2=0.9682 2pq=0.0315 and q2=0.0003 respectively. From these datait was concluded that 96.82 percent of human population in this provincewere homozygous normal 3.15 percent were heterozygous carriers (minorthalassemic)and 0.03 percent were homozygous affected and demonstrat ed major thalassemia. ,2001
1039,Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common error of amino acid metabo lism. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a variety of mutationsin the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase (PAH) gene. These mutations exhibit ahigh degree of association with specific haplotypes in different populations. These haplotypes are composed of different kinds of genetic markers. AnExtended haplotype is a combination of different RFLPs (EcoRV XmnI MspI EcoRI PvuIIb PvuIIa BglII ) while a mini haplotype consists ofone specific STR one specific VNTR and XmnI RFLP of the PAH gene. Since STR and VNTR are polymorphic markers they have higher poly morphism information contents (PICs) in comparison with RFLPs (eachhaving only two forms) and thus they represent to be more suitable mark ers in carrier detection procedure done by segregation analysis. However some RFLPs are needed beside these polymorphic markers to yield high ly efficient carrier detection results. One of the several markers we havestudied in order to identify their degree of heterozygosity and PIC is XmnI which is the only common marker in extended and mini haplotype. For thispurpose we extracted DNA from PKU patients blood samples and ampli fied exon 8 of PAH gene in them. Among 124 alleles only 8 alleles (6.5%)were digested with related enzyme (ASP 700) . Thus the degree of het erozygosity and PIC of XmnI RFLP in Iranian PKU patients are 0.12155and 0.11416 respectively. Combining this RFLP with STR and VNTR poly morphic markers in segregation analyses will increase the efficiency of car rier detection procedure. ,2001
1040,Phenylketonuria (PKU) the most common inborn error of amino acidmetabolism is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by more than 400mutations in Phenylalanine Hydroxylase gene (PAHdb). This gene 90 kilobases long includes 13 exons and is located in 12q22 q24 region. Distrib ution patterns of mutations in the PAH gene are specific to each popula tion. In this study the incidences of IVS10nt546 R261X R261Q andR408Q mutations among a group of Iranian PKU patients from all over thecountry were determined. IVS10nt546 occurring in intron 10 of PAH gene is the most common mutation among Mediterranean populations. The nexttwo ones have a good chance to occur since they belong to a hotspot inexon 7 of this gene and R408Q mutation existing in exon 12 is one of theonly two reported mutations among Persian ethnicity in PAHdb to date. Inorder to study these mutations we amplified exons 7 11 and 12 of PAHgene extracted from blood samples of PKU patients. PCR products werethen digested with DdeI HinfI DdeI and HaeIII restriction enzymes fordetecting R261X R261Q IVS10nt546 and R408Q mutations respectively. Among 130 alleles studied 40 alleles (33.3%) were positive forIVS10nt546 mutation and among 80 alleles 5 alleles(6.25%) were positivefor R261Q and 2alleles(2.5%) for R261X mutations. No allele was positivefor R408Q mutation. According to this data IVS10nt546 mutation seems tobe the major mutation in Iranian PKU patients. This result is in accordance with the prevalent mutation in Mediterranean populations. ,2001
1041,Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorderaffecting 1 in 10 000 to 15 000 females worldwide (1) and is caused bymutations in X linked MECP2 gene encoding for methyl CpG binding pro tein 2 (2 3). It plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. There are 5 prevalent mutations in methyl CpG binding protein 2 causingRett syndrome. Four of them are detectable by restriction analysis. In thisstudy we present the results of the search for four prevalent mutations inthe gene for methyl CpG binding protein 2 in Czech and Slovak patientswith Rett syndrome. Twenty two females with clinical diagnosis of Rett syn drome from Czech and Slovak Republics were investigated. Restrictionanalysis and direct sequencing of PCR products of methyl CpG bindingprotein 2 gene revealed 3 different mutations [473 C to T (T158M) in 3patients 502 C to T (R168X) in 2 patients and 808 C to T (R270X) in 1patient] in six unrelated patients with Rett syndrome. The results of restric tion analysis were confirmed by bi directional direct sequencing. The firststudy of Rett syndrome in Slavic population shows that three from hot spotmutations in exon 3 of MECP 2 gene are present in 27% of the patientsand dictates therefore the strategy in molecular diagnosis of Rett syn drome. Mutation R306C frequent in Swedish patients (4) was not foundin 22 Czech and Slovak patients. 1. Rett A. Wien Med. Wochenschr. 116 1966 723 726. 2. Amir R. E. et al.

1042,IVSII 1 is considered the most common beta thalassemia mutation in Iran. In the North of Iran by the Caspian Sea over 50% of affected individualscarry this mutation and the overall frequency in Iran is 30%. Restrictionenzyme mapping for beta globin gene cluster is important in systematicstudies of single copy genes causing beta thalassemia. The most frequentmutation in the Iranian population which leads to beta thalassemia is thesubstitution of G to A in the intervening sequence II nucleotide number 1.We have studied ten affected homozygous for IVSII 1. After restrictiondigestion for six polymorphic loci (XmnI HindIII/Ggamma HindII3 /wb AvaII/b RsaI/b HinfI/b) . We constructed chromosomal haplotype that arerelated to this mutation. Our result shows that the IVSII 1 mutation isessentially in company with two types of haplotypes about 40% and 30%respectively. These haplotypes are quite different from Mediterranean hap lotype for IVSII 1. ,2001
1043,Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a recessive disorder characterisedby episodes of fever and neutrophil mediated serozal inflammation. Themost serious complication of FMF is the development of amyloidosis. Colchicine has been shown to be effective in preventing the attacks of FMFas well as the development of amyloidosis1. The disease affects primarilyethnic groups living around the Mediterranean basin Ashkenazi Jews Armenians Turks and Arabs. The gene causing FMF has been cloned in1997 and several mutations characterised in MEFV gene. The aim of thisstudy was to determine the carrier rate in the Turkish population and themutation frequency in the clinically diagnosed FMF patients. We found aPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 281high frequency of carriers in the healthy Turkish population (20%). One healthy asymptomatic individual was found to carry mutations in both alle les (V726A/E148Q). The distribution of the five most common MEFV muta tions among healthy individuals (M694V 3% M680I 5% V726A 2% M694I0% and E148Q 12%) was significantly different (p <0.005) from that foundin patients (M694V 51.55% M680I 9.22% V726A 2.88% M694I 0.44% and E148Q 3.55%). The high incidence of MEFV gene mutations in theTurkish population (gene frequency of 0.011 95% CI = 0.06 0.15 and car rier rate of 0.20 95% CI = 0.12 0.28) indicate that new born screening maybe discussed in the future. ,2001
1044,Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS MIM 270400) is an autosomal reces sive multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome of variableseverity. Its incidence has been estimated to be approximately one in 20000 to 60 000 based on case frequency surveys in populations of Cau casian origin. Identification of the underlying gene defect has paved theway for molecular methods to identify carriers. Using allelespecific PCRswe screened 640 anonymous and random blood donor samples from Tirol(part of West Austria) for the presence of the three most common cau casian SLOS mutations (IVS8 1G>C W151X V326L). For the mutationIVS8 1G>C a carrier frequency of 1 in 50 (1 26 1 75 95% CI) was identi fied. W151X was much less frequent (1 141 0 95% CI). V326L was notfound in the sample analysed. Based on this data an incidence of SLOS ofabout 1 10.000 (1 1666 Ã¢\x80\x94 1 22 201 95% CI) is expected. Remarkably weknow only of two unrelated Tirolean SLOS patients. The discrepancybetween the expected and observed incidence could be due to misdiag nosed severe cases death prior to diagnosis or fetal loss. The high fre quency of the functional null mutation IVS8 1G>C suggests a foundereffect and/or heterozygote advantage. ,2001
1045,Fanconi anaemia (FA) a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder isknown to occur at a higher than normal incidence among the whiteAfrikaans speaking population of South Africa. The disease is charac terised by progressive bone marrow failure starting predominantly inchildhood various phenotypic abnormalities as well as an increased sen sitivity to the clastogenic agents diepoxybutane (DEB) or mytomycin C(MMC) resulting in chromosomal aberrations. Initial genealogical investi gations on 12 families affected by FA but with unknown mutational status identified GN and/or his spouse JDLB as common ancestors. A foundereffect the cause of the high incidence of FA among this population group was further substantiated by results obtained through complementationstudies and mutation screening showing the predominance of comple mentation group A and mutation types I II and III. The existence of threemutation types among the descendants of GN and JDLB raised the possi bility of more than one founder pair or family being involved. For this rea son an additional genealogical investigation was carried out limited toseven and six FA parents carrying respectively the Afrikaner types I and IImutations. Apart from GN /JDLB HDP and wife CD also featured promi nently as possible founders for the FANCA Afrikaner type I mutation whereas either PV/MDP are candidate founders of the FANCA Afrikanertype II mutation. ,2001
1046,Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of neu rodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive ataxia dysartriaand other neurological signs. Genes responsible for different types of SCA(SCA1 2 3 6 7) have been cloned showing in coding regions an expand ed CAG repeats in mutant alleles. In 1999 a novel CTG trinucleotide expansion in 3 untranslated region of SCA8 gene on chromosome 13q21was identified. Studies established on controls and patients with linkage tochromosome 13q21 showed tetramodal distribution of CTG repeat num ber. The prevalence of three non pathogenic ranges with different fre quency was shown. The pathogenic range was estimated as approximate ly 100 and more CTG repeats and was observed in patients with clinicalsigns of SCA (we observed such alleles in 3 families). However alleles withmore than 100 CTG repeats were also observed rarely in healthy controlsand in unaffected patients relatives. This phenomenon may be the resultof reduced penetrance of the gene. To establish a non pathogenic range ofCTG repeats for Polish population we performed an analysis of CTG poly morphism in a group of 250 Polish healthy controls. In one subgroup con sist of 100 persons aged 18 69 years two alleles were found with numberof CTG repeats 82 and 100 respectively. In the second subgroup 150 Pol ish controls age of 65 82 we observed one allele with 95 CTG repeats. Theresults of our study suggest that only CTG repeat number above 100 mayrelate to neurological signs. ,2001
1047,SNHL is a mono or multifactorial hearing deficit of great significance in ourculture that can be prevented in some cases. Objective to assess in afirst stage the prevalence of SNHL etiology in a qualified population aged0 15 yr. in order to analyse the involvement of the genetic component. Methods Retrospective study through the analysis of professional recordsof children and adolescents (N= 250) with hearing disorders attendingpublic and private specialised institutions of the city of Rosario that werediagnosed of hearing impairment by audiometry and evoked potentials. Results (%) are presented according the following summarised etiologicalclassification I) Congenital [32%] 1) Genetic [35] 2) Non genetic [65] a)infections [96] b) toxics [4]. II) Acquired [19]) 1) infections [66] 2) toxics[17 3) others [17]. III) Indeterminate [40] and IV) multifactorial [9]. Con clusions It is striking the high prevalence of the indeterminate and multi factorial groups within these groups it is probable the occurrence of genet ic disorders either syndromic or no syndromic that have not been ade quately diagnosed. Presently we are studying this population consideringSNHL as a complex trait which is our hypothesis through segregationanalysis and improving diagnosis regarding its etiology. ,2001
1048,Hereditary deafness is one of the most common inherited sensory disor ders which affects 1 2000 newborns. About 70% of hereditary deafness isnon syndromic. Autosomal recessive forms (DFNB) make up about 85% ofthese cases. Mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx26) gene are associated witha type of autosomal recessive non syndromic sensorineural hearing loss(ARNSHL) known as nan,2001
1049,Heterosis founder effects and mutation hot spots have been suggested toexplain the high frequency of Cx26 deafness. Alternatively we have pro posed that Cx26 deafness may have been specifically amplified during thepast 200 300 years by relaxed selection and assortative mating. In thepast the genetic fitness of the deaf may have approached zero. However the social economic and educational circumstances of the deaf haveimproved dramatically and have been accompanied by an increase in fer tility and the onset of assortative mating in some but not all countries. Con ventional wisdom holds that curing a rare recessive disease will not affectthe phenotype frequency appreciably for many generations. However thisconclusion assumes random mating and with phenotypic or genotypicassortative mating the approach to a new equilibrium can be much morerapid. Since Cx26 marriages account for a disproportionate share of non complementary matings and can only produce deaf offspring intermar riage among the deaf has preferentially increased this phenotype. Withdata from the 19th century we have shown that the frequency of Cx26deafness has doubled during the past 100 years. Furthermore the currentprevalence is lower in countries without a long tradition of intermarriageamong the deaf. If our hypothesis is correct the availability of premaritalgenetic testing to either avoid or ensure the birth of deaf children couldhave even greater effects on the phenotypic frequency but only if geno typic mate selection became a universal and uniform practice among thedeaf. ,2001
1050,Congenital deafness occurs in about 1 in 1000 infants and approximately80% of the cases are non syndromic and inherited in an autosomal reces sive pattern. Mutations in the gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26) GJB2 are the most common cause of recessive non syndromic hearing loss(NSHL). Cx26 mutations account for 30 60% of recessive NSHL in Euro pean and American populations. A specific mutation in the GJB2 gene known as 35delG represents a ÃÂªhot spot mutation and is found in approx imately 2/3 of the detectable Cx26 mutations. Nothing is known yet aboutthe spectrum of Cx26 mutations in Turkish population. In the present study we have studied 37 index patients from consanguineous Turkish familieswith autosomal recessive NSHL. The entire coding region of the Cx26gene was sequenced and a homozygous mutation was found in 27% of thecases. The 35delG mutation was present in 78% of all Cx26 mutationsidentified. One new mutation and two polymorphisms were identified. Todetermine the prevalence of the 35delG mutation in Turkish population weestablished a recently described screening method using PCR mediatedsite directed mutagenesis followed by a BsiYI digestion. We tested 359unrelated individuals and found 3 heterozygous carriers giving a carrier fre quency of 0.84% (1 in 120). Our data show that both frequency of Cx26mutations in recessive NSHL and the carrier rate of Cx26 35delG mutationin normal Turkish population is much lower than described for otherMediterranean countries. This finding reflects the mixed origin of Turkishpopulation. ,2001
1051,The most common form of non syndromic neurosensory autosomal reces sive deafness (NSRD) is caused by mutations in the gene GJB2 locatedon chromosome 13 encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26. Onemutation which represents a deletion of a guanine within a strech of six Gsbetween nucleotide positions 30 and 35 of the GJB2 cDNA (35delG) is found in 40 70% of NSRD cases and was shown to have a high allele fre quency (2 5%) in several randomly selected populations. Another deletion the loss of a timine in position 167 was found in the Ashkenazi Jewish pop ulation in 4% frequency. A simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) basedtest was used to detect both mutations in order to establish the allele fre quencies in the Hungarian control Gypsy and Ashkenazi populations. Wescreened 173 randomly selected Hungarian first time blood donors and351 unrelated unaffected Gypsy individuals for the Cx26 35delG mutation. We found 2 heterozygous in the control population which gives a carrierfrequency of 1 17% (0% 2.81%) which is lower but does not differ signifi cantly from the published data for Caucasian populations. The heterozy gous carrier rate in the Gypsy population was 1.4% (0.1% 2.7%) (5 het erzygous from 351). We identified 2 heterozygous individuals for mutation167delT among 48 Ashkenazi samples analysed so far. Our data supportthe assumption that the G track containing the deletion may represent aregion with higher mutation rate since we detected similar carrier frequen cies in two populations with distant origin. ,2001
1052,The connexin 26 (Cx26) gene has been shown to be a major cause of non syndromic recessive deafness. Although many mutations have beenfound a single mutation is responsible for the majority of alleles in differ ent populations (35delG). A high frequency of this mutation was revealedin populations of Northern Central and Southern Europe with higherprevalence in Southern Europe and the highest percentage in Estonia. Wedecided to expand this study further to the East and investigate severalpopulations of Russia. First we consider this investigation to be importantfor defining the strategy of diagnosis and genetic counseling of congenitaldeafness in Russia. Second this study could clarify the origin and the his tory of 35del mutation. Taking into account high frequency of this mutationin Estonia we paid a special attention to related Finno Ugric populations namely Mari and Komi. Three other populations Bashkirs Chuvashs andYakuts belong to Turkish speaking populations. In ethnogenesis ofBashkirs and Chuvashs participated not only Turkish but also some otherpopulations including Finno Ugric populations. Altogether 560 personsfrom 5 ethnic groups of Russia were analyzed for 35delG mutation. Twelvemutations were found resulting in average carrier frequency 1/46 7. It cor responds to the frequency of more than 1% chromosomes with mutation. ,2001
1053,"Introduction The relative incidence of different types of neuro sensorialdeafness has clearly changed for the last 25 years. Maternal rubella post natal ototoxicity and meningitis are much better controlled today. Mean while there s only little achievement in what prevention or reduction ofhereditary deafness (HD) incidence is concerned. Therefore the tendencyin the present and probably for the coming years is an increase in the HDrelative incidence with a lowering of acquired deafness of any kind. Objec tive Determining the incidence and the genetic characteristics of the HD inBihor county (with a population of 630000). Material and method A num ber of 59 cases have been studied. The pedigree following the segrega tion and establishing the type of heredity have been studied for each case. Results The incidence of HD is approx. 1/10000. The model of inheritanceis autosomal recessive in 55% of cases autosomal dominant in 40% ofcases and undetermined in 5% of the cases. Most of the times HD isneuro sensorial. Syndromic and non syndromic HD are described withexamples from the personal experience of rare cases of deafness likeDeafness + Sinphalangism S. Waardenburg S. Deafness + Oculo cuta neous albinism S. Alport S. Treacher Collins S. Conclusions Any case ofdeafness should be suspected as having a genetic cause. Therefore thefamily history a meticulous clinical examination audiogram and a try to sit uate the case in one of the genetic mechanisms are all recommended.

STUDYDESIGN The study population comprised children who were referred tothe Oulu University Hospital and who had non syndromal congenital sen sorineural hearing loss. A total of 70 patients were analyzed. The estima tion of carrier frequency was carried out in a random sample of 313 controlpersons. METHODS Detection of the 35delG mutation was performed byPCR amplification of the Cx26 sequence followed by direct sequencing ofpurified PCR products. Simultaneous sequencing to both directions wascarried out by automated sequencer (Li Cor 4200) using forward andreverse primers labeled with IRD800 and IRD700 respectively. Conforma tion sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) of PCR products was applied todetect the heterozygous carriers in control population and positive samplesin this screening were confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS Of the70 patients with the hearing loss 11 were found to be homozygous for the35delG mutation. These belonged to 7 families three from one two fromtwo and a single patient from four different families. Out of these 11patients three had severe and 8 profound hearing loss. In the control pop ulation four individuals heterozygous for the 35delG mutation were found which donotes a carrier frequency of 1/78 in Northern Finland. The screen ing of the Cx26 coding sequence for other mutations is under study. CON CLUSIONS The present results indicate that the Cx26 mutation 35delG isan important contributor to recessive inherited non syndromic hearing lossalso in Finland. The carrier frequency of this mutation was found to be ofthe same magnitude as reported previously in Central and NorthernEurope. ",2001
1054,Genetic deafness affects 50% of patients. A great portion of this kind of disorder is Non syndromic which respect to the mode of inheritance is cat egorized to autosomal recessive (AR) autosomal dominant (AD) X linkedand mitochondrial. In order to illuminate these ratios in Iranian population we started a retrospective study. A total of 180 patients were selectedbased on genetic background. The genetic counseling and pedigree analy sis were performed for each individual. Our results demonstrate 155 fami lies (86.11%) AR 21 families (11.67%) AD and for 4 families (2.2%) wecould not determine the mode of inheritance exactly. The statistical analy sis of data showed that distribution of mendelian inheritance of non Syn dromic genetic deafness in Iranian population is similar to other studies. Inour study the results showed that 38% of AR had moderate to severe and61.9% had profound hearing impairment. More over among AD cases61.9% had moderate to severe while 38% had profound hearing loss. Theresults also revealed that 57% of AD and only 17% of AR cases had pro gressive hearing loss. The investigation of consanguine marriage of theparents was revealed as 79.4% of AR and 7.4% of AD cases. From all thepatients 68.6% had consanguineous parents who 99.2% of them were ARand 0.8% were AD. In the future most of these families can be used forlinkage analysis. ,2001
1055,BACKGROUND. Usher syndrome (USH) is characterized by hearing loss vestibular dysfunction and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). Three clinical typesof USH are recognized. USH I profound congenital sensorineural deaf ness vestibular areflexia and RP. USH II congenital moderate to severehearing loss normal vestibular function and RP. USH III progressive hear ing loss progressive vestibular deficiency and RP. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS. The study was an epidemiological population based survey based on examination of data from medical researches schools andorganizations. A large number of the patients underwent clinical and genet ic assessment by the authors. RESULTS. A total of 366 deaf blind subjectswere assessed. 21% (77 subjects) previously diagnosed as having USHwere excluded because of incorrect diagnosis. In total 140 patients withUSH I 122 patients with USH II and 27 patients with USH III were diag nosed. The prevalence of USH I was1.6/100 000 USH II 1.4/100 000 andUSH III 0.3/100 000. The prevalence rate varied in different counties. USHI was most common in the three northernmost counties (7.4 /100 000).CONCLUSION. The total prevalence rate of USH is lower then previouslyreported. A large variation was found in USH I . While the three major typesof USH are clearly different the subtypes within type I II are so farbelieved to be clinically indistinguishable. Thus there is a critical need tofurther study phenotype genotype correlation in USH. This study of USH isthe most complete ascertainment that so far has been undertaken. ,2001
1056,The fragile X triplet repeat expansion at Xq27.3 has been shown to beassociated with mutation or instability 600 kb distal at the FMR2 repeatlocus. Concatenated mutation whereby a mutation at one locus somehowinteracts with mutation recombination deletion or transposition at anotherlocus is a possible explanation. In this study we examine evidence from asample of over 7000 independent haplotypes from the FRAX region. Weadopt the use of cladistic groups to more thoroughly define the propertiesof these haplotypes and in doing so isolate one group of haplotypes whichmay be predisposed to the phenomenon of concatenated mutation. Distin guishing concatenated mutation from founder effects is difficult within asingle population. We present our evidence for and against concatenatedmutation and in the process describe a previously undefined mutation atFRAXE. ,2001
1057,The fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of the (CGG)n repeat in 5end of the FMR1 gene. In order to look for linkage disequilibrium betweenthe fragile X locus and its flanking markers we analyzed the DXS548 andFRAXAC1 microsatellite markers in normal and unrelated fragile X malesof Croatian origin. Different distribution of alleles and haplotypes was foundbetween these two samples. A significant increase in frequency of DXS548allele 2 was found among fragile X patients when compared to normal indi viduals (31 3% vs. 2.86%). We also noticed a different distribution ofFRAXAC1 allele A (18.8% in fragile X group vs. 10.0% in normal popula tion). Haplotype 7 C was the most represented in normal population(57.14%) while haplotypes 2 C 8 C and 2 A were more frequent in fragileX group (accounted for 43.75% of all fragile X chromosomes and less than4% of normal population). This difference may suggest the existence oflinkage disequilibrium between the two loci and/or selective advantage ofthis haplotypes among fragile X affected individuals in Croatia. ,2001

Objective. To284 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Geneticsestimate the relative risk (RR) of the live borns with SA and DS in different Ukrainian regions. Methods. Data on live borns only were received fromthe annual reports of seven medical genetic centres of Ukraine (Southern Western North Northern Eastern Central South Eastern South West ern). Period of the observation from 1993 to 1999. The precise data aboutstill borns with birth defects are unknown in Ukraine. RR was calculatedaccording to Epi Info program for each selected defects. Results. It wasestablished that RR evenly disseminated among the new borns of thecountry. RR was lower in the Northern and the South Eastern regions (0 86at the 0.81 0.90 confidence interval 0.88 CI 0.84 0.93). RR was the high est in the Southern (1.10 CI 1.02 1.19) and the Northern Eastern regions(1.19 CI 1.14 1.25). Conclusion. The distinctions in the rates of observeddefects can reflect not only the difference of incidence in population butmainly the difference in the levels and the quality of medical care and othersocio economic factors.

1059,Since 10 years ago our Genetics Center has been evaluating 128 familiesincluding 196 cases with the collaboration of the Genetic and MetabolicDepartment of Erasmus University based in Rotterdam the Netherlands. The result has been the diagnosis and discovery of these rare but veryimportant disorders in the families under scrutiny. Out of the above num ber of families mentioned the final diagnosis in 41 was MPS the mostcommon type being MPS III. Also 48 families with 77 patients were suf fering from Lipid Storage Diseases. The most common disorder wasMetachromatic Leukodystrophy followed by Niemann Pick Gauchers andTay Sachs diseases respectively. 39 families with 67 cases were diag nosed to have micromolecular Metabolic Diseases. Organic Acidemiaswas the most common type. Totally in 50 families prenatal testing was car ried out showed that 11 (22%) of the fetuses were affected. Details of dif ferent clinical subtypes would be presented in this article. In dealing withthis patients especially while planning for prenatal testings genetic coun selling was carried out to provide the families with detailed informationabout their suffering children.

1060,Fragile X syndrome (FXS) second most common cause of mental retar dation (MR) affects 1 4000 males and 1 7000 females. The CGG repeatof FMR 1 gene varies from 6 to 54 triplets in normal individuals whereasin FXS families prermutations (PM) of 55 to 200 repeats and full mutations(FM) of more than 230 repeats are observed. Hypermethylation of CpGisland upstream the CGG repeat causes the transcriptional shutdown ofFMR 1 gene resulting in the absence of FMRP protein in FXS patients.1687 individuals 590 MR boys and 88 MR girls their parents and otherfamily members (759) were tested for FXS and 250 normal individualswere used as controls. DNA extraction from peripheral blood lymphocytesfollowed by modified non radioactive Southern blot and PCR (CGG sizing)analysis were performed. Immunocytochemical detection of FMRP onblood smears was also performed for 300 individuals. The results con firmed the clinical diagnosis of FXS in 28 males and 2 females with FM and1 male with PM. In the remaining individuals an allele distribution of 7 to 58CGG repeats with a mean of 28 30 triplets was observed. The FMRP anti body test confirmed the diagnosis in 15 patients and revealed 3 more FXSfamilies with no CGG expansion. The combination of non radioactiveSouthern and PCR analysis enhanced by the FMRP test was highly effi cient for diagnosis and thus supportive of large scale population screeningespecially since a rough estimation revealed an FXS frequency at about1 4250 boys in Greece. ,2001
1061,"Social selection against X linked intelligence? Natalia V. Kovaleva Instituteof Obstetrics and Gynaecology RAMS Mendeleev line 3 199034 St. Petersburg Russia e mail ', ' During the pastdecade several different genes involved in learning capacity were identi fied on human X chromosome. They were discovered because of muta tions causing nonspecific mental retardation in males. On the other hand these genes are reasonably considered to be the genes for higher intelli gence and even have been discussed as genes by which Homo may havebecome sapiens [Turner 1996]. As the pattern of X chromosome inheri tance is very specific (men transfer X chromosome to their daughtersonly) the process of transmission and spreading of such genes in popula tion may be influenced by social factors. In times when there was no effec tive birth control and even women with high intellectual potency had no orlittle chance of self realization outstanding and successful men and theirdaughters had many offspring which ensured maintenance of X linkedgenes for intelligence in population. At present intelligent women who hadinherited excellent genetic material from their father tend to have few chil dren because childbearing hampers their social development. This leadsto a decrease in frequencies of the clever alleles in population. Thus social selection against genes for higher intelligence has been putting intoeffect through successful women. The genetic drift of the clever allelesaway from initial values is expected to be stronger in societies with tradi tional attitude to gender roles in household. ",2001
1062,AR FMR1 and FMR2 genes have been mapped to the X chromosome. The expansion of CAG (AR) CGG (FRAXA/FMR1) and GCC repeats(FRAXE/FMR2) is the mechanism associated with Kennedy disease andfragile X syndromes correspondingly. The distribution of these loci is var ied and characterized by the positive asymmetry among the world popula tions. This means they tend to accumulate the repeats over time. A hypoth esis does exist that the transition from normal sized to expanded alleles isa result of a mutational bias towards larger repeat sizes of the repeatarrays in the normal population. The distributions for AR FRAXA andFRAXE loci were analyzed in a West Siberian Slavic population. Automat ed genotyping of these loci was perfomed by PCR amplification with fluo rescently labeled primers on the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer andGenescan softwere. We detected among 113 unrelated healthy individu als 12 alleles for the AR locus ranging in size from 21 to 32 repeat units 31 alleles for the FRAXA locus ranging in size from 8 to 56 repeats and18 alleles for the FRAXE locus ranging in size from 9 to 27 repeats. Theallele s frequency distribution for AR and FRAXE loci was unimodal withthe size of modal allele in 27 repeats (18%) and 17 repeats (19.9%) cor respondingly. The FRAXA locus showed a bimodal distribution with themodal alleles in 18 20 repeats (11.5%) and 28 29 repeats (24.6%). Allele sdistribution for AR locus in Slavic population had a narrower spectrum anda higher size of modal allele compared with another studied populations. The FRAXA locus showed very high frequency of gray zone alleles. Alle les containing more than 40 repeats share 12.4% and more than 45 8.0%of all alleles in population. In contrast the allele s distribution for FRAXElocus was characterized by the predominance of the short size alleles (<15repeats). Intriguingly each investigated locus has the special features inallele s distribution compared with another world populations. ,2001

Consanguinity is prevalent widelyamong muslim groups the first cousin unions being most common. Fromour field survey (Ansari and Qureshi groups) and hospital samples (Jawa har Lal Nehru Medical College and Hospital Aligarh & All India Institute ofMedical Sciences New Delhi) we tried to find out the genetic load due tomental retardation classified as chromosomal disorders fragile sites sin gle gene disorders and low IQ in polygenic variation. Among chromosomal disorders trisomy 21 was most conspicuous again free trisomy 21 beingthe most prevalent one followed by G/G and D/G translocation. Turner s Klinefelter s and intersex cases showed lower IQ levels. Fragile site casescomprised Xq.27 cases being most common. Amino acidopathies andenzymatic disorders were more common among consanguineous off springs than non consanguineous ones.

1065,Autosomal gene frequencies allow to describe the genetic structure of pop ulations in particular to reveal the effects of drift or of admixture. Applyingspecific models to population samples it is also possible to infer a rate ofadmixture of a population with respect to hypothetical parent populations. Some Hungarian ethnic groups claim to be descendant either of Turks Iranian or of the ancient Huns. Hungarian nation was founded in the 9thcentury from people caming from eastern regions close to the Ural moun tains and since then people speak an Uralic language belonging to theFinno Ugric language group. We compared the gene frequencies of eightethnic groups and seven hypothetical ancestral populations includingUralics applying a model of admixture. The results most of which confirmhistorical hypotheses or the oral tradition show that only one ethnic grouphighly resembles the Uralic population. ,2001
1066,In the group of patients with congenital hip dislocation (N=93) the frequen cies of ABO blood types were similare to the average value of Serbian pop ulation while the percentage of blood group A is slightly increased. Com paring frequencies of Rh blood groups we can see that there is no differ ences between tested samples. In the sample of children affected withacute lymphoblastic leukemia (N=163)the frequencies of ABO blood typeswas similar to the average value of Serbian population while the percent age of blood group O is slightely increased. The percentages of Rh bloodtypes are not showing any differences between tested samples. It is inter esting that in the group of top sportsment including 61 winners of interna tional champions the frequencies of A and B blood groups weredecreased AB was absent and O group was about twice more frequent(71%)than an average value of Serbian population. The percentage of Rhnegative individuals is significantly lees (10%)in the group of top sports men comparing with percentage of those individuals in Serbian popula tion(17%). Taking all this into account we may see that variation in physi cal abilities can bee correlated with their immunogenetics properties. ,2001

EDTA plasma samples were obtained from 120 unrelated donorsfrom a premountain Carpatian region of Romania (Prahova Valley) andonly this individuals were considered as autochthonous. X2 tests andgenetic distance analysis were used to compare the data with those ofother studies of Mediterranean and European populations. The number ofthe phenotypes observed in both systems showed no significant differ ances to the data expected according to the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. The comparison with the other European and Mediterranean populationsshows that the genes and the phenotype frequencies of the tested sam ples lines nearer to those of Southeuropean Mediterranean populationthan to Balkan or Slavic groups. Our results are interpretable in the back ground of historical and ethnical events which have played an importantrole in changing the genepool of the Romanian population. Linke R. P.

1068,"Analyses of Mesolithic and Neolithic samples from Portugal have led tonew methods for the investigation of paleodemography and to the formu lation of an hypothesis that the population increased during and after a pro tracted period of shift from hunter gatherer to agricultural subsistence. While culturally the two populations are distinct there is evidence on non metric analysis of dental traits that the two populations may be geneticallycontinuous. We report on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fromMesolithic (Moita Arruda Amoreira Melides) and Neolithic (Casa daMoura Feteria Furninha) skeletal samples and the implications of thisdata in understanding the prehistoric population relationships in thisregion. The analysis of mtDNA haplogroups in ancient remains provides ameans of mapping human population divergence and adds a new tool tothe investigation of biocultural evolution. We will examine the prevalentmtDNA haplogroups from Neolithic and Mesolithic remains from Portugalto establish the degree of relatedness between individuals from differentburial sites. The haplogroups selected for the study are based on data frommodern Iberian populations. These are H I J K T U3 U4 V W and X. Fourteen Neolithic dental and skeletal samples from five sites and fifteenMesolithic samples from three sites are available for analysis. Our work todate has shown absence of haplogroups V and I in this population.

Portuguese influence in Atlantic islands using 5 STRs (CD4 FES/FPS VWA31/A TH01 and TPO) and CD4/Alu haplo type R. Velosa1 A. T. Fernandes2 H. Sp nola2 A. Brehm2 1Departamento de Biologia Universidade da Madeira Funchal Portugal 2Centro de Ci ncias Biol gicas e Geol gicas Universidade da Madeira Funchal P', 'This work presents a survey of 5 STRs and a polymorphic marker basedon the association between an STR and an Alu element. The surveyincludes the Madeira archipelago composed by two inhabited islands theAzores and Cabo Verde by nine islands each (the former divided into twogroups Windward and Leeward) and S o Tom e Principe by two inhabit ed islands. Madeira was discovered in 1419 the Azores in 1427 CaboVerde in 1460 and S o Tom e Pr ncipe in 1470. All these Atlantic islands were colonized by the portuguese but with different populational inputs. Madeira and the Azores were populated mainly by Portuguese from themainland although the former island received a non negligible amount ofslaves in the 15th and 16th centuries originated from Cabo Verde islands then a portuguese colony. Cabo Verde was essentially populated withslaves brought from Guin (W est African coast) and relatively few euro peans and S o Tom and Principe received their black population from the slave trade with Angola. STRs (Short Tandem Repeat) are polymorphicmarkers mainly used for forensic and population genetics. We used 5STRs (CD4 TPO FES/FPS TH01 and VWA31/A) and a haplotypeCD4/Alu. Our aim is to verify the genetic input of the European Portuguesepopulation in the Atlantic islands they colonized.

1070,The mtDNA haplogroup L3e identified by the restriction site +2349 MboIwithin the Afro Eurasian superhaplogroup L3 ( 3592 HpaI) is omnipresentin Africa but virtually absent in Eurasia (except for neighbouring areas withlimited genetic exchange). L3e was hitherto poorly characterised in termsof HVS I motifs as the ancestral HVS I type of L3e cannot be distin guished from the putative HVS I ancestor of the entire L3 (differing fromthe CRS by a transition at np 16223). An MboI screening at np 2349 of alarge number of Brazilian and Caribbean mtDNAs now reveals that L3e issubdivided into four principal clades each characterised by a single muta tion in HVS I with additional support coming from HVS II and partial RFLPanalysis. The apparently oldest of these clades (transition at np 16327)occurs mainly in central Africa and was probably carried to southern Africawith the Bantu expansion(s). The most frequent clade (transition at np16320) testifies to a pronounced expansion event in the mid Holocene andseems to be prominent in many Bantu groups from all of Africa. In contrast one clade (transition at np 16264) is essentially restricted to Atlantic west ern Africa (including Cabo Verde). We propose a tentative L3e phylogenythat is based on 197 HVS I sequences. We conclude that haplogroup L3eoriginated in central or eastern Africa about 46 000 (+/ 14 000) years ago and was a hitchhiker of much later dispersal and local expansion events with the rise of food production and iron melting. Enforced migration ofAfrican slaves to the Americas translocated L3e mitochondria the descen dants of which in Brazil and the Caribbean still reflect their different region al African ancestries. ,2001
1071,Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphism in populations of Iran Turk menistan and southern part of Russia was examined by RFLP analysis ofhaplogroup specific sites. The Iranians Turkmenians and Russians werefound to have a large portion of mtDNAs belonging to haplogroupsobserved in West Eurasian populations. However the relative frequenciesof this continental fraction of the mtDNA pool vary considerably over thepopulations studied. In Iranians and Turkmenians the majority of themtDNA lineages belong to haplogroups T J U K W I. However hap logroup H which encompasses 19% of Turkmenian and 42% of RussianmtDNAs is virtually absent in Iranians. The East Asian specific fractions ofmtDNAs were observed in 12% of Iranians (haplogroups M* D A B) andin 20% of Turkmenians (haplogroups C D E) but were not found in theRussian mtDNA pool. Therefore the Russians exhibited a high portion ofidentical haplotypes in relation to those observed in other Europeans. Based on the mtDNA haplogroups composition analysis the Turkmenianswere found to be the closest population to the Caucasus populations.

The aim of the present research wasto study polymorphism of CAG and CTG repeats in 10 populations of theVolga Ural region and test the hypothesis about unstable transmissionwithin normal range. 24 CTG allelic variants with bimodal frequency distri bution and 19 CAG ones were detected. CTG/CAG repeats distribution ischaracterized with a high range of variations from 5 to 34 repeats for CTGand from 10 to 32 for CAG repeats. A majority of alleles in these popula tions contain 5 and between 11 14 for CTG and 13 15 for CAG repeats. Investigated populations reliably differ that is evidence of subsistence ofpopulations heterogeneity. Heterozygotes frequency varies from 70% to92% for CTG and from 51% to 59% for CAG repeats. CTG repeats trans mission within 50 healthy families showed change CTG22 to CTG26 andCTG32 to nan,2001
1073,India is a country with rich diversity in language caste religion culture socio economic structure food and marriage practices. The Northeasternpart of India is distinct in being a home to many indigenous ethnic mon goloid populations which are not found elsewhere in the country. Theregion itself is described as a narrow bridge or passage between the eastand west of the Asian continent. Two major language groups divide thisregion one with an ancient history and the other with a recent past. The for mer is represented by the only MonKhmer Austro Asiatic speaking tribesof India while the other involves many other migrant tribal populations ofTibeto Burman origin. Geographically they inhabit the young fold mountainbelts of the eastern Himalayas and the Austrics is particularly located in thegeologically oldest plateau of the region. It is postulated that the presentland mass was an island which drifted away and got attached to the Indi an continent. Hence our interest is to find the possible origin and possiblemigration of these populations (Khasi and Garo) using Y chromosome andmitochondrial DNA markers as they are uniparentaly transmitted and doesnot undergo recombination. Recent findings suggest that this languagegroup represents one of the oldest inhabitants of this country and mostprobably the origin of the language itself. We substantiate our findings withtracing the paternal and maternal lineages using Y specific markers andmitochondrial DNA on two matrilineal population group of Mon Khmer Aus tro Asiatic Khasi and the recent migrant Tibeto Burman speaking Garotribes from the state of Meghalaya in North east India. Of the 310 individ uals studied 4 showed a 9 bp deletion in the mtDNA between COII andtRNA gene. The frequency is very less when compared to other Mongoloidpopulations. In the HVRI sequence these population showed a very uniquehaplotype. Analysis of Y Alu polymorphism (YAP) in these populations didnot show any YAP+ alleles however YAP related M15 showed 9bp dele tion which is an ancestral allele. In addition analysis is also being carriedout with 400 unrelated blood samples with Y chromosome STRs (DYS19 389I and II 390 391 AND 393) Biallelic markers SNPs and Southernbased markers. Results obtained from the above mentioned markers willhopefully throw more light in tracing the origin of this linguistic group. ,2001
1074,Aging involves many factors and processes. Several hypotheses havebeen suggested such as the effect of non specific free radical damage ofmacromolecules their repair which includes genetically determined fac tors or the theory that aging is programmed in cellular genome. The genet ic effects on human longevity were found at a few loci. The most interest ing is the association between HLA genes and longevity directly connect ed to their physiological function. Numerous studies have indicated that thelongevity is associated with HLA DRB1 locus. With an aim to reassess thecontribution of HLA DRB1 polymorphisms to inter individual variation of human longevity we have compared their genotype distribution betweenolder and young control group of Macedonian population. We studied 170unrelated healthy aged subjects between 65 and 93 years (55 man and115 women ) selected according to Senieur protocol. The control groupconsisted of healthy individuals age 25 35 years. The HLA typing was per formed by dot blot analyses using 24 nonradioactively labeled probes. Inthe group of aged subjects we found that the most frequent alleles are HLADRB1 *11 *04 and *01. Comparing the frequency of alleles found amongthe group of older people with the alleles in the control group of young peo ple significant difference of the DRB1 *11 allele was observed (x2=3.54 p<0.05). These results support the finding of other authors that the DRB1*11 allele is associated with survival advantage. ,2001
1075,In Thailand the term hill tribes or more recently used highland Thai designates ethnic minorities most of whom live in the remote mountainousareas of the north and the southwestern parts of the country. These groupsof people migrated from neighboring countries and from south China with in the last century. Great varieties of languages and traditions have beenpracticed depending on where they came from. For better understandingof the population structure of these ethnic minorities we aim to investigatethe degree of genetic variation within and between these populations andto analyze their phylogeny. Y chromosome tetranucleotide repeatmicrosatellites at 3 loci DYS19 DYS389I and DYS393 were employed forgenetic diversity investigation of 6 hill tribe populations in Northern Thai land. DNA was extracted from white blood cells of 107 males 21 Karenand 15 Lahu (matrilocal groups) 29 Hmong 15 Iu Mien 15 Akha and 12Lisu (patrilocal groups) by inorganic salting out procedure amplified bypolymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using Ampli Tag Gold (Perkin Elmer). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver stainning were usedto identify allele sizes. Five alleles were observed at the locus DYS19 while four alleles were detected at both DYS389I and DYS393 loci withdifferent frequencies among populations. The genetic diversity is 0.264 0.313. 0.5323 0.5769 0.6503 and 0.6623 in Akha Lisu Hmong Karen Lahu and Iu Mien respectively. A neighbor joining tree based on Fst dis tance reveals that the genetic distance between Karen and Iu Mien is thenearest while Akha and Lisu are furthermost apart. ,2001
1076,AAT deficiency is an inherited disease which usually manifests as COPDand early pulmonary emphysema. The most common mutations associat ed with lowered serum AAT are PI type Z and PI type S. Allele PI S beingin homozygous state does not result in disease but in compound het erozygosity with allele PI Z causes clinical manifestation. The frequency ofallele PI Z in Latvian population is 0 040 which is the highest frequencyreported so far (Beckman L. et al. 1999 Maliseva B. et al. 2000). The aimof this research was to detect prevalence of allele PI S in Latvian popula tion. DNA was extracted from venous blood of 236 healthy Latvians whoserelatives for at least 3 generations are Latvians living in Latvia. The analy sis was performed by PCR. The products were digested by TaqI andanalysed on 6% PAA gel. From 472 chromosomes analysed 15 PI S alle les were found. Consequently the allele frequency in Latvian population is0 032. The PI S allele frequency is the highest in southern part of Latvia. Finding the reason of such geographical distribution differences might bethe subject of following studies. ,2001
1077,The supergene family of glutathione S transferases is divided into fourclasses the classes mu (GSTM1) and theta (GSTT1) showed geneticpolymorphism that involves a gene deletion. This deletion has beenshown to be associated with the susceptibility to mutagen induced cyto 288 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Geneticsgenetic damages. The P450II supergene family comprises five subfamiles one from this the reduced activity of P450IID subfamily has been relatedto Parkinson disease and responsible for poor metabolism of more than 30commonly prescribed drugs. The aim of the paper was to calculate the nullgene frequency in GSTM1 and GSTT1 systems and the frequencies of thetwo most occurred defective alleles of CYP2D6 systems *2 and *3. TheDNA samples were prepared by Chelex methods and phenotypes wereestablished using PCR method. In GSTM1 the population sample was 160 53% of tested persons have the phenotype GSTM1( ) and the gene fre quencies were GSTM1+ = 0.27 and GSTM1 = 0.73. In GSTT1 the popu lation sample was 170 the GSTT1( ) phenotype occurred in 26% of test ed persons and the gene frequencies were GSTT1+ = 0.49 and GSTT1 = 0.51 respectively. The frequencies of two main ÃÂªdefective alleles ofCYP2D6 gene named CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*4 are under calculation inthe moment. All obtained results were compared with results of other Pol ish or Central Europe population samples. ,2001
1078,For the first time Vietnamese population in the North was studied for theD1S80 (pMCT118) locus at a large amount. Blood bloodstain hai and sali va samples of 217 individuals were tested by PCR technique. Those samples were extracted by chelex then using directly as DN tem plates for PCR with the specific primers of D1S80 locus. After amplification PCR products were separated by 6% of polyacrylamide gel electrophore sis (PAGE) and stained by silver staining. From 217 samples amplified on D1S80 locus 57 different genotypes and24 alleles were observed. Alleles 15 35 37 40 and 42 had not bee foundyet. Allele 24 (14 3%) and allele 22 (14 1%) were the most common alle les whereas alleles 14 33 34 36 and 39 were the less popular ones(0 2%) in Vietnamese population. The D1S80 locus demonstrated a het erozygosity of 80 18%. All mother/child pairs (42 cases) shared at leastone D1S80 allele. Similar method was applied for D17S5 locus. The study shows that 12 alle les were observed and 2 ones (B12 and B13) not found yet in Vietnamesepopulation. B8 was the most spread allele (14 7%). Heterozygosity ofD17S5 locus is 83 76%.Those data show that D1S80 and D17S5 loci are highly polymorphic inVietnamese population and can be used as the important markers forforensic medical analyses and paternity tests. ,2001
1079,Historical archaeological and anthropological data show that Central Asianpopulations are admixed groups which received cultural and biological con tributions from Europeans and Eastern Asian. To test the impact of thesehistorical events on the genetic pool of Central Asian populations we haveanalysed eight autosomal microsatellites (DM DRPLA AR TH01 TPOX CSF1PO VWA LPL ) in more than 200 individuals from the following fourpopulations settled in a vast region at the crossroads of different culturesand habitats Kazakhs from the Kegen mountain valley (Kazakhstan) Huig urs from Penjim (Kazakhstan) Kirghiz from the Pamir mountains andKirghiz from the Talas plains (Kirghizstan). The same individuals were pre viously studied for D loop mt DNA sequences RFLPs Y chromosomemarkers (STR and SNPs) and classical markers. The statistics measuringinternal variation within populations evidence high level of diversity asexpected in the case of admixed populations. Analysis of molecular variance(AMOVA) showed a very low degree of genetic differentiation among thefour populations using the autosomal markers (Fst=0.01) in agreement withthe results given by HVR I mtDNA sequences (Fst=0.05) but in discordancewith the Y chromosome markers results (Fst=0.22). Non metric multidimen sional scaling was used to represent genetic distances between Euro Asi atic populations. The Central Asian populations present an intermediateposition between Europeans and eastern Asians in agreement with the his torical record. Eastern Asian and European sex specific contributions to thecurrent gene pool of Central Asian populations differ significantly. ,2001
1080,The Volga Ural region occupying the central place on a map of Euroasia. With the aim of knowledge of the factors of gene pool formation geneticdifferentiation evolutionary development and genetic interaction of themodern peoples of the Volga Ural region the study of three types DNA polymorphisms of nuclear genome restriction fragments length polymor phism and analysis of nucleotide sequences of HVSI mtDNA polymor phism of seven Y chromosomal microsatellite loci were carried out. Theresults of claster analysis on the data of polymorphism of autosomal DNA loci has allowed to reveal the greatest similarity of gene pool of Bashkirswith Tatars least with gene pools of Mordvinians and Komi. Other matrixof genetic distances between populations comes to light on mtDNA mito types correlation between genetic distances that revealed by two inde pendently evolutioning genomes nuclear and mitochondrial is absent. We think that these differences is possible to explain by different type ofinheritance of nuclear and mtDNA. Genetic distances between populationsof the Volga Ural region received by test with phage 13 will most be coor dinated to the complex information about ethnogenesis of these peoples. It testifies to efficiency of use of this marker for the population geneticanalysis of modern population structure. The genetic distances received ona basis of polymorphism of seven Y chromosomal microsatellite loci reflectphilogenetical relation between the Volga Ural peoples on father s line. The data of claster analysis only in general will be coordinated to linguisticclassification according to which these peoples belong to different lan guage families. So phylogenetic analysis shows their genetic connectionby father s line that is explained by centuries old ethnical and culturalcommunications and territorial interactions of close ethnic components. ,2001
1081,In conditions of toxic effect of the factors of environment of the large chem ical centres it is vital important to evaluate character of interrelationsbetween the acting of influence of environmental and distribution of poly morphic markers of blood the adaptive importance of which is known incohorts of inhabitants. Character of distribution of five biochemical markersincluding transferrin (Tf) group specific component proteinase inhibitor haptoglobin (Hp) AB0 blood groups and its significance for ge netic bio chemical adaptation were studied by isoelectricfocusing in 75 families (14 16 years children and their parents which represent two generations) andin two national groups (79 Bashkirian and 129 Russian) of constant inhab itants of large indus trial centre of the Republic Bashkortostan Ã¢\x80\x94 Sterlita mak. The peculiarity of the gene pool of citizens was studied by way of acomparison of features of the distribution frequencies of phenotypes alle les and genotypes in the investigated groups both in some other urban andrural populations of Russia about Russians of Egorievsk city (Moscowrange) and Asbest (Sverdlovsk range) and Bashkirians of rural districts ofRepublic Bashkortostan. The characteristic feature of every investigatedgroup is de tected namely the high density of alleles Tf*C3 and Hp*2.The redistribution of concentrations of alternative alleles is ob served forthe locus Tf are peculiar lowered frequency Tf*C1 and increased for thegene Tf*C2 for the locus Hp reduction of the allele Hp*1 is featured. Theconsiderable density of the alleles Tf*C3 Tf*C2 Hp*2 in the investigatedcohorts on one hand is being represented rather of adverse in view of acorrelation of the given alleles with the formation of an increased numberof the hydroxyl free radicals (Eckfeldt 1985) and with the intensive currentof the lipoperoxidation (Mironov 1992). It allows to an ticipate that a shareof individuals inclined to the damage of subcellular structures is growing and as the consequence they are more subjected to diseases. However the earlier carried out researches on health of the citizens within frameworks of biochemi cal monitoring have established of more than in twicethe activation of processes of the lipoperoxidation along with high inten sityof the microsomal oxidation which has a positive influence at a stage ofthe fast detoxification of considerable amount of xenobiotics. Probablypersons with the alleles TfC2 and Hp2 have the increased level of detoxi fication in a connection with this are more adapted to the influence of achemical environmental pollution however the given assumption is onlypreliminary by virtue of a limited proportions of investigated groups. ThePosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 289analysis of the genetical attitudes between investigated cohorts was car ried out on a complex of the data about frequencies of sixteen alleles outof five independent locuses researched. In a course of clustering it isrevealed that three investigated cohorts are very genetic similar. Mostdetached from all other groups of the towns people was cohort of bashkiri ans of Sterlitamak. This group was enough removed from cohort ofbashkirians of rural districts also group of Russians of Sterlitamak occu pies the detached position in comparison with cohorts of Egorievsk andAsbest which unite into one cluster. Use of procedure of Maximum Likeli hood Factor has allowed to lead research of joint variation of frequen ciesof alleles of the investigated populations and to frame mathematicalmodel which describe differentiation of groups in the whole with the helpof sizes of more common order of the factors. Two factors (1 and 2) withdispersion 3 54 and 3 01 which totally depict 93 56% of total variance offrequencies of alleles were considered. It is revealed that all four cohortsof the towns people are subject to influence of the factor 1 and occupy inexpanse of factors unified compact range. Whereas specified cohortsunites residing in city with a high toxic load it is possible to interpret con ditionality of the factor by 1 specific influence of me dium of city with thedeveloped chemical industry. The locating in expanse of factors of groupsof the townspeople differs essen tially from peasants of the Bashkir nation ality. The load of the factor 2 at our glance is attributable to absence ofunsuccessful toxic influence in cohort of Bashkirians of a countryside. Thecohort of the Russians of Sterlitamak in expanse of two factors also isremoved from compared cohorts of Russians of Asbest and Egorievsk. Apparently the found shifts in frequencies of alleles are demonstrating twoparties of the genetic processes occurring among the Sterlitamak citizens on the one hand adaptive plasticity of the population and on the otherhand adaptive reorganisation with the essential payment for the adap tation. ,2001
1082,Genetic diversity in native peoples from six Russian areas (Arkhangelsk Kostroma Kursk Novgorod Ryazan and Smolensk regions) has beenanalysed. We examined the polymorphism of minisatellite loci D1S80 and3 ApoB because of their high discrimination power. More than 700 unrelat ed individuals from 13 population samples were studied. Allele distributionsof these loci have been obtained. Allele typing was performed using PCRtechnique and PAAG electrophoresis followed by silver staining. For pre cise determination of 3 ApoB alleles specially designed allelic ladder wasused. Observed allele distributions were found to be similar with thatshown for other Caucasoid populations. Both loci revealed high degree ofpolymorphism we detected more than 20 alleles for each and geterosy gosity level above 76 per cent. These data make us possible to supposethat differencies between Russian populations are statistically insignificant. Comparative study of Mongoloid group (Jakut population sample) haseduced statistically confirmed difference with Russians. ,2001
1083,Genetic diversity at the 9 STR loci which are universally approved andwidely used for forensic investigations has been studied among the 9 Indi an populations representing diverse ethnic linguistic and geographic back grounds. The 9 STR loci were profiled on 902 individuals using fluorescentdetection methods on ABI377 System with the aid of Profiler Plus Kit. Thestudied populations represent two upper castes Brahmin and Kayastha and a tribe (Garo) from West Bengal Meitei a Hindu caste with historicallinks to Bengal Brahmins a migrant Muslim group and three tribal groups Naga Kuki and Hmar from Manipur State in Northeastern India and amiddle ranking semi nomadic herders caste called Golla from AndhraPradesh. Gene diversity analyses suggest that the average heterozygosi ty is uniformly high (>0.80) in the studied populations and the coefficient ofgene differentiation highest so far observed for any class of markersamong Indian populations at any hierarchy local regional or national. Both NJ and UPGMA trees bring out distinct clusters that are consistent with ethnic linguistic and/or geographical affiliations of the studied popula tions. The fit of Harpending and Ward model of regression of average het erozygosity on the gene frequency centroid (Rii) is good and the observedoutliers in line with the known history and population structure of the stud ied groups. Our study suggests that the 9 STR loci employed thus farmostly in forensic investigations can be fruitfully used in microevolutionarystudies as well and for reconstructing phylogenetic histories of the humanpopulations at least at the local level. ,2001
1084,Over 400 unrelated individuals from the three largest population groups inBulgaria (Bulgarians Bulgarian Turks and Gypsies) have been analyzedfor the highly polymorphic STR loci vWA THO1 D21S11 and HPRT. Thestudy was performed by quadruplex amplification of the loci followed bydenaturing electrophoresis on ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham PharmaciaBiotech). No deviations from Hardy Weinberg expectations were observedfor studied loci. Forensic efficiency values (H MEC and DI) of the studiedSTR set indicate its applicability for identity and paternity testing in the Bul garian population. Significant differences in allele frequency as well as ingenotype distributions across all loci except vWA have been observedbetween studied population groups. The observed heterogeneity supportsour previous suggestion based on Y chromosome STR data that popula tion differentiation should be taken into account in forensic case analysisand paternity testing in Bulgaria. ,2001
1085,Background In October 1999 the countryÃÂ«s new filiation law begun andpaternity testing by DNA profiling has increased in importance. Geneticdata analysis of STR loci in the chilean population has only been done inthe Metropolitan region. Chilean population is mainly the result of theadmixture of Spaniards and Amerindian women during the XVI and XVIIcenturies. Later inmigrations never reached over 4%. Aim Describe ourexperience in paternity testing and present the results of genetic dataanalysis of CSF1PO TPOX TH01 F13A01 FESFPS vWA D16S539 D7S820 D13S317 loci in the 5th region population. Subjects and methods 36 non related subjects attending our paternity testing service were ana lyzed for the nine loci. PCR amplification and analysis was done asdescribed by Promega Corp. Results CSF1P0 TPOX F13A01 vWA loci presented a departure from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Only in four pairsof alleles of 3 loci show linkage dissequilibrium. The allele frequency wasalike to other population of similar ethnic origin. The power of exclusion ofthe nine loci is 0.9998. We discarded paternity in 4 cases and confimed in13 cases with an average probability of 99.97637 (99 89 99 99999). Con clusions Despite that the alleles frequency is similar to the observed inother populations the power of exclusion of these loci is higher than thereported for hispanic populations. To confirm these preliminary results andget a better knowledge of our population we are going to sample it byscreening and typing. DIPUV 20/2000. ,2001
1086,In Brazil there are several rural afro derived populations (dubbed as quilombo remnants) founded in their majority at the end of the 19th cen tury by fugitive and/or freed slaves. These populations maintain substan tial genetic and cultural African derived characteristics in spite of migrato ry contributions by other neighboring populations. We have been workingwith three main quilombo remnant populations from northeastern Brazil(Rio das R s Riacho de Sacutiaba and Mocambo). We have used Y chro mosome STRs markers (DYS 390 DYS 391 DYS 392 DYS393 and DYS290 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics394) as well as protein markers (ESD CAII GLO PGM 1 HP and Hb) in order to study gene diversity and interpopulational heterogeneity. Proteinanalysis revealed mean heterozigosity levels of 0.26 (s.e.=0.074) for Ria cho de Sacutiaba (n=41) 0.26 (s.e.=0.073) for Mocambo (n=99) and 0.28(s.e.=0.059) for Rio das R s (n=176). Mean gene diversity for the STRswas respectively 0.62 (s.d.=0.177) 0.53 (s.d.=0.273) and 0.66(s.d.=0.078). There is very significant heterogeneity between these popu lations as estimated by protein markers (Chi square=54.65 df=14 P<0.001). Pairwise comparisons between the three populations indicatesthat the Rio das R s population is distinct from the two others due mainlyto the presence of the HB*C allele and to the high frequency of the CAII*2allele. STRs markers also revealed significant heterogeneity between thethree populations (Chi square=89.53 df=38 P<0.05). Pairwise compar isons indicated that all three populations are distinct from one another. Therefore we conclude that the Y specific markers are more informativeand show greater gene diversity between these populations. Acknowledg ments Funda o Cultural Palmares ,2001
1087,There are several features that make the Y chromosome a very valuabletool in human population studies. Unlike other human chromosomes theY chromosome is haploid and most of it does not recombine in meiosis soit is passed as a whole from father to son and in principle it is possible toreconstruct the histories of paternal lineages by comparing modern Y chro mosomes. The aim of this study was to find out about population historiesby measureing the frequencies of different Y chromosome types in differ ent populations of eastern Europe and the Caucasus area by using unifiedprotocols of the European Y chromosome Diversity Project. A total of 980DNA samples were screened for 8 unique biallelic Y chromosome markers. The set of markers included SRY 1532 SRY 8299 DYS 257 DYS 287 M9 12f2 Lly22g and Tat. All populations differed considerably and everypopulation had an unique pattern of haplogroup occurrencies. Distinct cli nal distribution of HG9 HG1 and HG3 was detected allowing to speculatein terms of founding populations. A general demographic conlusion of thisstudy suggests that none of the studied populations underwent recent Y chromosomal bottleneck. Further progress of this study depends on study ing as many as possible uncharacterised populations enlargement of therepertoire of the informative SNP s and parallel analysis of microsatellitevariation. ,2001
1088,Five Y chromosome specific human STR loci (DYS393 DYS392 DYS391 DYS390 and DYS19) were analysed in 222 samples of Ukraini ans with Slavic origin from different regions of Ukraine (West East Northand Central) and in 68 samples from isolated Crimean tatars population. DNA typing of STRs loci was performed by fluorescent PCR followed byhigh throughput fragment analysis on a single wavelength automated DNAsequencer. The allelic variation analysis has not revealed differences in allloci between four Ukrainian populations. Allele frequency distributionshowed high significant differences between pooled Ukrainian and theCrimean tatars populations for all loci. Gene diversity index (D) averagenumber of repeats index for each locus (R) and genetic distances betweenUkrainian and Crimean tatars population were estimated. Five loci(DYS393/DYS392/DYS391/DYS390/DYS19) were found to generate 222different haplotypes 78 in Ukrainian population and 46 in Crimean tatarspopulations but only 14 of which were shared by these two populations. The most common haplotype (13/11/11/24/16) was found in 28 out of 222(13%) Ukrainians (D = 0.94). Assuming a stepwise mutation model haplo type tree was constructed. Haplotype analysis in Crimean tatars revealeda high level of heterogenity D = 0.97. It was hard to find ancestralCrimean tatars haplotype because of nine relatively common haplotypewere observed. Such high level of diversity within Crimean tatars suggeststhat this population is likely to consists of a set of discrete lineages with dif ferent origin. ,2001
1089,Madeira and Cabo Verde archipelagos were discovered by the portuguesein 1419 and 1460 respectively. Madeira is composed of two inhabitatedislands Madeira and Porto Santo while Cabo Verde has nine islandsdivided in Barlavento (Windward) and Sotavento (Leeward) groups. Botharchipelagos were part of the slave trade route which flourished in the 15thand 16th centuries. Slaves originated from the West African coast (spe cially Guinea) were sold in Cabo Verde and then proceeded to Lisbon. They were also used to colonize the islands of Santiago and Brava in CaboVerde. Here we used markers YAP/SY81 from the Y chromosome to char acterize the populations from both archipelagos plus a population fromPortugal. YAP polymorphism is due to Alu insertion in chromosome Y whileSY81 is a mutation from an A to G. It is believed that the insertion in YAPoccurred only once in human history and it appears to have happenedafter the out of Africa event. The SY81 mutation supposedly happenedonly after the migration from the South to the North of Africa. Thus thismarker allows the separation of subsaharians from other africans. Our aimis to verify the african genetic influence in the atlantic islands of Madeiradue to the slave trade. We collected DNA from unrelated individuals whichare originary from the same island at least for three generations. Samplesizes and origin were the following Madeira (N=130) Cabo VerdeSotavento (N=120) Cabo Verde Barlavento (N=110) and Guinea (N=130).DNA extraction and amplification were done using the chelex method andspecific primers for each Y marker. In case of SY81 marker we usedrestriction enzyme NlaIII to digest the PCR product and separated thefragments in polyacrilamide gels visualized by silver staining. Haplotypefrequency values of all populations were compared and the results dis cussed. ,2001
1090,The Madeira archipelago is composed of two inhabited islands Madeira with about 250 000 inhabitants and Porto Santo with 5000. Colonised in15th century by the Portuguese it suffered many different influencesthrough the centuries. In the 15th and 16th centuries Madeira was part ofthe slaves route and received many of the slaves going to mainland Por tugal. On the 18th century there was a British commercial influence withentire families settling there. Known by its favourable climate a lot of peo ple came to recover from diseases such as tuberculosis. In this centurytourism certainly contributed to the various inputs on its inhabitants. PortoSanto unlike Madeira was exposed to attacks by North African pirates especially during early colonisation. Here we present a survey on thegenetics of Madeira population using Y STRs (short tandem repeat) whichare currently applied in forensic genealogical and evolutionary studies. Our aim is to verify the different male influences in the existing populationfrom these two islands. We collected blood samples from unrelated maleindividuals originated from Madeira (95) and Porto Santo (16) with knownlocal ancestors at least until 3 generations back. The STRs (DYS19 DYS389I and II DYS390 DYS391 DYS392 and DYS393) were deter mined by PCR multiplexing using a Perkin Elmer ABI 370 sequencer. Wecompared the haplotype frequencies found with other population studiesand discuss the results. ,2001
1091,Magyars imposed their language on Hungarians but seem not to haveaffected their genetic structure. We analysed some mtDNA and Y chromo some polymorphisms in a sample of the Hungarian ethnic group Pal cPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 291who for historical reasons could have retained genetic traces of Magyars more than other groups. In addtion we examined a mixed Budapest sam ple. 100 individuals were tested for the markers defining all the Europeanand Asian mtDNA haplogroups and 50 individuals for Y chromosome mark ers namely the 12f2 and 49a f/TagI RFLPs the YAP insertion themicrosatellites YCAIIa YCAIIb DYS19 and the Asian 50f2/C deletion. Inthe mtDNA analysis only two subjects belonged to the Asian B and M hap logroups. The Y chromosome analyses showed that the Pal c differedfrom the Budapest sample by the absence of YAP + allele and by theDYS19 allele distribution that the proto European 49a f Ht 15 and neolith ic 12f2 8Kb were rather uncommon in both groups that there is a highprevalence of the 49a f Ht11 and the YCAII a5 b1 and that the Asian50f/2C deletion is absent. The influence of Magyars on the Hungarian genepool has been low through both females and males and Hungarian lan guage could be an example of cultural dominance. An expansion centredon YAP 49a f Ht 11 is revealed by the median network based on com pound haplotyes. 49a f Ht 11 could represent either a paleolithic marker ofeastern Europe which underwent expansion after the last glacial period ora marker of more recent spread of the Yamnaia culture from southernUkraine. ,2001
1092,Nine single nucleotide (SNP) or indel binary polymorphisms were used todetermine the frequencies of 12 Y chromosomal haplogroups in 219 malesbelonging to 8 administrative districts of Romania and 70 males from theRepublic of Moldova. The Romanian samples represented the country sthree main geographical regions i.e. Transylvania in the North West (Sam ples 1 5) Walachia in the South (Sample 6) and Moldavia in the East(Samples 7 8) up to the right bank of the Prut river setting the border withthe Republic of Moldova (Sample 9). After carrying out a hierarchicalgrouping of population samples into two major groups the different quotasof genetic diversity were evaluated by AMOVA. The five highest Fct werefound when one of the groups included the Western Samples 1 3 and 6and the other included the Eastern Samples 7 8 and 9. Thus the Carpathi ans turn out to be a breaking point in the gene geography of Eastern Cen tral Europe providing a finer definition of one of the possible sharp genet ic changes between Western and Eastern Europe. We suggest that theassociation between the mountain ridge and this genetic discontinuity isnot a mere coincidence being the Carpathians also representative of anecological boundary. This latter may have acted as a barrier to gene flowover long periods of time allowing a divergence whose signature is stilldetectable in the population samples examined in this work.

1093,In 1976 about 2 000 blood samples pertaining to 7 Amerindian tribes wascollected in the central west portion of the Brazilian Amazon. It was stud ied for a great number of classic markers and recently DNA was extractedfrom some of these samples. The amount obtained was enough to studymicrosatellites by PCR followed by PAGE (silver stained). Results from 10autosomal and 5 Y linked microsatellites in about 320 Amerindian distrib uted in 8 villages pertaining to 4 tribes (4 villages Tik na 2 Kaxin wa 1 Kanamar and 1 Ban wa) are here presented. Thirteen of the eighty exacttests performed indicates Hardy Weinberg deviation. The heterozigosityfor the ten autosomal loci ranged from 0.46 to 0.68 with an average of0.58. Interpopulational diversity revealed by Y linked microsatellites(Gst=0.333) is much higher than that revealed by autosomal STRs(Gst=0.045) intrapopulational gene diversity obtained from the first mark ers set (Hs=0.188) is much lower than that from the second one(Hs=0.593). These estimates from both sets of markers show that inter populational diversity values are higher than those usually described forthe major ethnic groups and lower than the observed for other Amerindi ans from Brazil. The intrapopulational diversity obtained here is lower thanreported values for other populations including South American Amerindi ans. These findings corroborate previous reports that indicates (a) a high er interpopulational diversity among Amerindian populations and (b) highinformativeness of Y linked polymorphisms in populational studies.

1094,Distribution of Y chromosome haplotypes in 10 ethnic groups of Siberiaand Middle Asia (Tuva Buriat Altai Evenk Kirghiz Uzbek Siberian Tatar Tadjik Russians Ukrainians) was investigated in order to reconstruct theevolution of paternal lineages in North Eurasia. Compound haplotypeswere constructed for more than 400 Y chromosomes using five biallelic loci(SRY3225 YAP DYF155S2 Tat and DYS199) and seven microsatellites(DYS19 DYS389I DYS389II DYS390 DYS391 DYS392 and DYS393).Automated genotyping of STR loci was performed with HEX TET orFAM labeled primers with the ABIPrism310 genetic analyzer and Genes can software. High level of gene diversity and substantial degree of genet ic differentiation of male specific gene pool (Fst = 0.212) in modern NorthEurasian populations were found. Haplotypic lineages and their evolution ary relationships were reconstructed. It was shown that most haplotypes inmodern North Eurasian population have common ancestry traced back tothe Upper Paeleolithic period (about 15000 years ago). Using the molecu lar variance of microsatellites within the biallelic haplogroups the age andorigin of ancestral haplotypes for DYF155S2 (6900 years) and TatC(4200 years) lineages which are specific for population of North Eurasiawere estimated. ,2001
1095,The geographic structure of Y chromosome variability has been analyzedin native populations of South America using the high frequency NativeAmerican haplogroup defined by the DYS199 T allele and 6 Y linkedmicrosatellites (DYS19 DYS389A DYS389B DYS390 DYS391 andDYS393) typed in 169 individuals. The following pattern of within andamong population variability emerges from the analysis of microsatellitedata 1. The Andean populations exhibit significantly higher levels of with in population variability than the Eastern populations of South America. 2.There is a weak but significant correlation between genetic and geograph ic distances which explains 5 10% of the observed variability betweenpopulations. 3. The isolation by distance model for the geographical struc ture of variability in South America tested by spatial autocorrelation analy sis was rejected. 4. Genetic distance analysis suggests higher homo geneity between Andean populations than non Andean ones. Based onthese results we propose a model for evolution of the male lineages ofSouth Amerindians based on differential patterns of genetic drift and geneflow. In the West of the continent associated with the Andean area popu lations have relatively high effective sizes and gene flow levels amongthem which creates a trend to homogenization of the gene pool. On theother hand Eastern populations settled in the Amazonian region CentralBrazilian Plateau and Chaco region exhibit higher rates of genetic drift andlower levels of gene flow with a resulting trend to genetic differentiation. This model is consistent with the linguistic and cultural diversity of SouthAmerindians the environmental heterogeneity of the continent and theavailable paleo ecological data. ,2001

1097,Determination of frequency and distribution of human Y chromosome shorttandem repeats (STR) alleles and haplotype analysis plays an importantrole in forensic medicine paternity testing and tracing back to genomic driftin human evolution. Though disadvantages due to it s sex limited nature Y STRs also have some advantages since they present as single copysequences in genome and do not necessitate complex molecular methodswhich differs from autosomal STRs. In this study eight Y STR loci includ ing DYS19 DYS388 DYS389/I DYS389/II DYS390 DYS391 DYS392 DYS393 in males from Central Anatolian Region were investigated. Nor mal healthy males living in the same geographical region for at least threegenerations were included in the study. PCR analysis were carried out withY STR specific primers on genomic DNA from peripheral blood samplesafter obtaining informed consent. Size determination of PCR productswere detected by silver staining following %6 polyacrylamide gel elec trophoresis (PAGE). Distribution of alleles for each Y STR locus was deter mined and haplotype analysis was carried out and compared with data inthe literature from other geographical regions. ,2001
1098,Historic data and population genetics studies demonstrate that the Brazil ian population is tri hybrid (composed by Amerindians Africans and Euro peans) and heterogeneous in it s composition. About 4 million Africanswere brought to work as slaves between 1600 and 1870 in differentregions of Brazil slaves often fled their masters founded independentcommunities in remote locations with difficult access called quilombos ormocambos. Many of these communities remain isolated still preservingtheir identity today with little cultural influence from the surrounding com munities. Because of that they become an important resource for studiesof the origin and characterisation of Brazilian blacks. Results of 5 Y linkedmicrosatellites (DYS19 390 391 392 393) in 4 communities (northeast ern Brazil) are here reported. Interpopulational diversity (Gst=0.044) issimilar to those described for the major ethnic groups however intrapopu lational diversity (Hs=0.567) exhibits a very high value.

1099,Polymorphism of Y chromosomal microsatellite loci are very useful tool toinvestigate the origin and the history of human populations. We studied 9ethnical groups from Volga Ural region of Russia that is the eastern partof Europe. It has been an area of constant genetic contacts betweenFinno Ugric Indo Iranian Turkic Siberian and other ethnical for mationsduring the long historical period. The Bashkirs Tatars and Chuvashes area Turkic speaking populations. The Mari Mordvinians Udmurts and Komiare a Finno Ugrian populations. Being horse breeders and cattle herders they are of great anthropological interest because they differ in theirlifestyle and language one from another. The haplotypes diversity basedon Y chromosomal short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRs) and fre quency of biallelic T/C transition (Tat mutation) of RBF5 locus in Volga Uralpopulations have been typed. The specific putative ancestral Y chromoso mal haplotypes were observed in everyone ethnical groups. Median Join ing microsatellite networks and neighbour joining trees were constructed. Our results revealed high intrapopulation variation in the male gene pool. We demonstrate that the several ancestral Y chromosomes taken part information of the modern Volga Ural people on a male line. The age ofancestral haplotype in each population was estimated at 9000 or 10000years. It will be coordinated to the archeological and historical data aboutoccurrence of the first man in territory of Volga Ural about 10000 yearsago. ,2001
1100,Infertility affects 15% attempting pregnancy and in 40 50% of these casesthe male partner has qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of sperm pro duction. In 60% of cases the origin of reduced testicular function isunknown. Microdeletion of the long arm of the Y chromosome (distal partof band 5 and 6) are associated with spermatogenic failure and have beenused to define three regions on Yq (AZFa AZFb and AZFc) which are crit ical for spermatogenesis and are recurrently deleted in infertile males. Eighty infertile males males with oligozoopsemia and azoospermia wereincluded in this study. Semen analysis was done in each case to determinethe spermatogenic status. They were subjected to detailed clinical exami nation endocrinological and cytogenetic study. 30 G banded metaphaseswere analyzed and in all cytogenetically normal cases (n=60) microdele tion analysis was carried out using PCR. For this genomic DNA wasextracted using peripheral blood. The STS primers tested on each subjectwere sY84 sY86 (AZFa) sY127 sY134 (AZFb) sY254 sY255 (AZFc).PCR amplifications found to be negative were repeated at least 3 times toconfirm the deletion of a given marker. The PCR products were analyzedon a 1.8% agarose gel. Seven of the sixty cases (11.7%) showed deletion of at least one of theSTS markers. Three cases had AZFc deletion three cases had AZFa andAZFb deletion and one case showed AZFb deletion alone. Correlation ofphenotype with microdeletion was done in each case to determine anyphenotype association with deletion of particular AZF locus. The overallfrequency of microdeletions varies from 1 55%. In the present study thefrequency of microdeletion was 11.7%. These differences in deletion fre quency and loci may reflect genuine geographical and ethnic dfferences. ,2001
1101,Population genetic studies in Colombia have been scarce and limited tofew regions. Surname studies can be used to approach the genetic struc ture of a population in a relatively simple and economic manner. We pres ent the genetic structure of Colombia based on a sample of 48054 individ uals and 4015 surnames distributed in 20 regions representing the wholeCountry. Different estimators of population structure were calculated among them random isonimy (Iii) the coefficient of kinship (phi ii) Fisher salpha and the Karlin McGregor s ni. The lowest alpha values wereobserved in Antioquia (156.33) and Viejo Caldas (136.31) regions sharingcommon culture. The highest alpha values were observed in Atl nticoPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 293(313.76) and San Andr s (294.52) regions of relatively recent immigration. Consistently the first two aforementioned regions showed the lowest nivalues (0.036455 and 0.044484) and the other two the highest ni values(0.189841 and 0.656652). Other estimators were calculated estimator A the proportion of population with single surnames and estimator B theproportion of population included in the twenty more common surnames. Ahighly significant correlation were observed between ni and the estimatorA (0.98 test value 10.35) and between phi ii and the estimator B (0.93 test value 7.39). Also negatively between alpha and phi ii ( 0.87 testvalue 5.9). Principal component analysis showed that the two first axesrepresent the 72.79% of the total variance. A dendrogram according theWard s method showed six main clusters representing geographic cul tural and ethnic similarities. The Euclidian and geographic distancesamong regions also showed significant correlation. ,2001
1102,Clinical and laboratory outcome was made that include metabolic neona tal screening of patient coming from 388 amniocentesis made in the SocialSecurity Hospital of Panama from August 1997 until November of the2000. Until that moment 292 children was born. 9 pregnancies were inter rupted for parents request. We find 88.1% fenotipically normal and 11.9%with alterations. Of these 10.3% of the cases had non cromosomic alter ations and 1.6% with cromosomics alterations (1.0% in diagnostic pitfallsand 0.6% alterations detected prenatally). Additionally was made in allpatients neonatal metabolic screening finding 1.0 % altered. The earlydetection of some alterations allowed to apply therapeutic measuresaccording to the case for the improvement of the quality of the patients life. ,2001
1103,Ancient DNA was successfully extracted from 35 mummy bones from theNorth of Chile dated 4000 to 700 years BP. Our main objective was tocompare the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity of pre Columbian pop ulations with contemporary Chilean aboriginal lineages and to examinehypotheses about the peopling of South America. We determined the pres ence of the main four Amerindian haplotypes by RFLP analysis. We found14 individuals belonging to haplogroup A 7 to haplogroup B 7 to hap logroup C 3 to haplogroup D and 4 individuals who did not harbor any ofthe classical Amerindian haplotypes representing 11.5% of the sample. Twelve DNA samples corresponding to different individuals weresequenced for the D loop hypervariable region I between positions 16081and 16380. Most of the haplotypes determined as A B C and D throughrestriction analysis and 9 bp deletion determination were confirmed bysequencing. Three of the samples not presenting any of the classicalAmerindian haplogroups neither show any of the described Amerindiannucleotide changes. The results indicate that haplogroups A B C and Dwere the most common among Amerindians who peopled South Americain the past. Interestingly other mtDNA lineages that were also carried to thecontinent at least 4000 years BP remain until 1300 BP. In conclusion wesuggest that early Amerindian aboriginal populations showed a greaterdiversity than living populations. The apparent loss of some mtDNA line ages over time may be explained by the extensive decrease in the aborig inal population size due to the European colonization.(Fondecyt 198 1111) ,2001
1104,Skeletal remains from five human individuals in good stratigraphicsequence were discovered in 1996 at Ba o Nuevo cave site in the ChileanPatagonia. All of them have been dated between 9000 8000 years BP thusbeing the earliest human skeletal remains found to date in Patagonia. DNAwas extracted from bones of the two adults and two children and the mtDNA haplotype determination was carried out through RFLP and mtDNAD loop sequencing. The RFLP analysis revealed that three individuals thefemale the male and one child found physically next to the femaleremains belong to haplogroup B. The analysis of the hypervariable regionI showed the presence of characteristic Amerindian nucleotide changesfor this haplotype in the female and in the child DNA. However the maleadult mtDNA did not present any of these characteristic changes. The sec ond child present haplotype C either through RFLP or D loop sequenceanalysis. Additionally we extracted and PCR amplified DNA from groundsloth (Mylodon) ossicles estimated to be 11000 years BP and fromCamelidae bones dated to 9000 years BP. A fragment of the 12S rRNAgene was analyzed for these two samples and the human bones. Thesequences obtained for these samples are different between them andeach one is homologue to the corresponding published sequence. Theseresults strongly support an early arrival of haplogroup B to the south ofSouth America and suggest that early colonizers carried other haplotypesbesides the characteristic Amerindian haplogroups described for livingpopulations. ,2001
1105,A total of 722 rural communities founded mainly by fugitive slaves at theend of the 19th century has already been identified in Brazil. Many of themremain similar to the founder populations in terms of their genetic and cul tural characteristics. A deletion of 32 pb in the CCR5 gene (Ã\x98ccr5 allele) isconsidered to be an European genetic marker since it occurs in Europeanpopulations (highest observed frequency = 10%) but it is absent in African Asian and South American Indian populations. Thus its presence in non European populations must reflect European contribution in their origin orthe occurrence of inter ethnic admixture. In this work we investigated theincidence and distribution of the Ã\x98ccr5 allele in three Afro derived popula tions from northeastern Brazil Ã¢\x80\x94 Rio das R s (n=100) S o Gon alo (n=53)and Mocambo (n=71). The allele Ã\x98ccr5 was observed in these three com munities which indicates European contribution to all of them. However itsfrequency in Mocambo (5 6%) is higher than in Rio das R s (1 0%) and inS o Gon alo (0 9%) which may reflect dif ferent origins or different histo ries of inter ethnic contact. The frequency of Ã\x98ccr5 in Mocambo is similarto urban Brazilian populations which have a high degree of European con tribution. This corroborates our phenotypic observation of high frequencyof mixed people (European and Amerindian contributions) in this commu nity. On the other hand the high frequency of Ã\x98ccr5 in Mocambo can alsohave resulted of founder effect. Acknowledgments Funda o Cultural Pal mares CAPES and FAEPA ,2001
1106,The genetic variability in 100 individuals from three native Quechua popu lations of Northern Central Central and Southern Peruvian Andes wasexamined on the basis of mitochondrial DNA by RFLP analysis and partly(n=65) by D loop (first hypervariable control region) sequencing. The mito chondrial DNA haplotypes of these three South American populations clus tered into the four main Amerindian haplogroups A B C and D with fre quencies 13% 53% 9% and 25% respectively. Intra population variabilityanalysis evidences higher variability of Andeans in comparison with otherSouthamerindian populations (nucleotide diversity=0.02 +/ 0.01). Theneutrality test of Fu (Fs) and mismatch distribution show that Andean pop ulations conserve the sign of an ancient expansion probably predating thepeopling of South America. This result suggests that the peopling of theAndes has not been associated with a bottleneck founder effect. The threeAndean samples analysed are significantly differentiated (Fst=0.065 p<0.05 calculated by AMOVA). The analysis of mitochondrial variabilitygives further support to the Andean Brazilian differentiation hypothesis(Fsc=0.11 p<0.01 by AMOVA) previously proposed using classical mark ers. This result is consistent in part with data from Y chomosome variabili ty. The east west differentiation of Southamerindian populations probablyconstitutes the major continental pattern of genetic structure in South294 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population GeneticsAmerica. However little information is available up to now on mtDNA vari ation to perform a reliable and detailed phylogeographic analysis. Morepopulations should be investigated to identify spatial patterns of geneticvariability with higher resolution. ,2001
1107,In a previous attempt to investigate the maternal origins of Antioquia weevaluated in this population 4 biallelic markers that identify the majorAmerind mtDNA haplogroups. In that survey 90% of the samples hadAmerind diagnostic sites while the remaining 10% could have representedeither other Amerind linages (e.g. by reversion of diagnostic sites) or non Amerind linages introduced by the Spanish and African immigrants duringcolonial times. In order to have a more refined estimation of the origins anddiversity of the Antioquian mtDNA here we have sequenced the mtDNAcontrol region hypervariable segment I in a sample of 87 Antioquians including all those individuals previously identified as non carriers ofAmerind diagnostic sites. A comparison of mtDNA sequence diversity withpublished data for Amerind and non Amerind Latin American populationswas also done. Our results indicated that Africa has the second largestmaternal contribution to the Antioquian gene pool while Europe had anunexpectedly low contribution Diversity estimates seen in Antioquia arecomparable to those seen in Amerind populations and lower than in othernon Amerind Latin American populations. The larger African female contri bution to Antioquia could be explained by several factors including theirearlier arrival higher reproduction rate and higher number of immigrantsduring colonial times. These views are supported by historical data. Thediversity analysis supports the genetic isolation of the pre ColumbianAntioquian population and a population expansion after the arrival of theSpanish and African immigrants. ,2001
1108,We classified 173 Brazilian individuals as White Black or Brown based ona standardized multivariate phenotypic analysis that included skin color hair color and texture and the format of the lips and nose. DNA sampleswere collected from the same subjects and typed with the 10 populationspecific polymorphisms defined by Parra et al (Am. J. Hum. Genet. 63 1839 1851 1998). As geographic controls we used 70 African Europeanand Amerindian individuals. Based on the DNA typing we assigned toeach individual an Index of African Ancestry (IAA) that consisted of theratio of the likelihoods of observing the person s findings on the hypothe ses of African or European origin. The logarithm of IAA (LIAA) proved to bean extremely reliable tool for differentiating African from Euro Asiatic indi viduals with absolutely no overlap. Although analysis of the Braziliansshowed a small correlation between average LIAA scores and the pheno typic classification individual analysis revues in several instances com plete dissociation between the two parameters. For instance one blackindividual had the fourth lowest score while one Brown individual had thehighest observed. Our study clearly demonstrates that genetic markerspermit an individual classification in respect to African versus Euro Asiaticgeographic ancestry. Moreover in Brazil phenotypic racial traits are sev eral orders of magnitude worse as predictors of genomic origin than stud ies involving indigenous populations of Africa and Europe.

1109,This paper examines the Genetical demography of Tharus a tribal groupof Uttar Pradesh of North India. This tribal group is divided into six endog amous divisions representing six genetic isolates viz. Rana Gosain Rawat Katharia Dangora and Pachchimaha. Rana and Dan gora are further regionally subdivided and are reproductivelyisolated. These endogamous groups inhabit areas having diversesocial geographic occupational and economic conditions. These variationsin habitat are reflected in their reproductive patterns. A study of opportuni ty of selection based on the reproductive pattern reveals that the index ofmortality is high in all the endogamous groups except one but variation canbe observed in the index of fertility. Tharus practice family planning and themean of live births and surviving children is less in groups which are edu cated. Thus the total index of selection has contribution of both the fertil ity and mortality. Only in two groups the index of total selection has the con tribution of the index of mortality and the index of fertility is very small. Theeffective population size depicts that genetic drift does not seem likely tobe a significant force in the general history of these populations. ,2001
1110,ALU polymorphisms provide a useful tool to population geneticists forunderstanding the population dynamics that have occurred over time. Wereport here a study of Six Alu insertion loci (TPA25 D1 APO PV92 FXII IB and ACE) from 18 endogamous caste and tribal populations (900 sam ples). The regions studied include North (5 populations) Central and South(9 populations) and Western India (4 populations). Overall spectrum ofvariation in these populations is very interesting at different geographicaland cultural levels. High level of insertion frequencies was observed insome highly inbred groups. Average levels of heterozygosities were foundto be relatively high in these populations (range 41% to 49.8%). The genet ic diversity coefficient GST among this group of populations was observedto be high. Phylogenetic trees and principal components analysis (PCA)computed from Alu frequencies provide support for socio cultural and geo graphical assignment of these populations in Indian population structure. Results are discussed with reference to population origins and human evo lution in India. ,2001
1111,We have examined variation in twenty four microsatellite markers amongst150 individuals each from the three endogamous groups of Uttar Pradesh India. DNA was amplified using fluorescently labelled primers run on astandard 6% denaturing sequencing gel using ABI 373 sequencer. Statis tical packages used for data analysis were POPGENE and PHYLIP. Thenumber of alleles varied from 4 10 with an average of 6 at each locus. Total number of alleles found for 24 STR markers under study were 145.Heterozygosity was found to be quite high at all the loci. The average het erogygosity varied between 0.44 to 0.84 among Bhargava 0.44 to 0.80among Chaturvedi and 0.42 to 0.85 among Brahmin. Populations understudy were in genetic equilibrium and obeyed the null hypothesis. High het erozygosity was observed within these populations showing high diversitywithin these pupulations. Our results reveal that Bhargavas andChaturvedis differ significantly from one another. There might have been anancestral pupulation i.e. Brahmin which expanded rapidly and subse quently split into largely isolated (endogamous) pupulations viz Bhargavasand Chaturvedies. Centroid analysis revealed that maximum gene flowhas taken place in Brahmins. However Bhargvas experienced the lowestgene flow. From the present study it may be postulated that Brahmins mayPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 295be the ancient population as the genetic distance of Brahmins from the over all gene freuency centroid of the three populations was found to belowest among the three populations. ,2001
1112,Various epidemiological studies have showed that genes coding forapolipoproteins (APOB APOE APOAI CIII AIV and ACI CII E gene clus ters Lp(a)) are the candidates for determining genetic variation in plasmalipid levels and risk of atherosclerosis. Most of these studies evaluating therisk of atherosclerosis vis a vis apolipoprotein were carried out mainly inEuropean populations. Such type of polymorphic studies are limited in Indi an Populations. We have analysed APOE APOCII APOH and APOAIV in 9endogamous populations from North Indian state of Punjab.1075 individu als belonging to Brahmin Bania jatsikh Kahatri Rajput Scheduled Castes Lobanas Ramdasias and Ramgarhia castes were genotyped using iso electric focusing and two dimensional gel electrophoresis. The overall levelof polymorphism in these populations is extensive and comaparable tomany Caucasian populations. A number of interesting genetic features andclines emerged from our extensive analyses. The world s lowest APOE*4allele frequency was observed in Ramgarhia while Ramdasia had thehighest APOA IV*2 allele frequency (0.093). The frequency of APOCII 2was observed to be the highest in Punjabi [populations. Multivariate analy ses (Correspondence analysis multidimensional scaling analysis) of thePunjabi and the world population highlights the potential of these markersfor human genetic diversity studies in addition to medico genetic implica tions. ,2001
1113,Tribal communities in India constitute the largest tribal population in theworld. There are about 461 tribal groups which constituted 8.08% (about68 million) of the total population of India as per 1991 Census. In India trib al communities are highly vulnerable to hereditary diseases and have ahigh degree of malnutrition morbidity and mortality. Tribal health is com pounded by poverty illiteracy ignorance of causes of diseases hostileenvironment poor sanitation lack of safe drinking water exploitation faithin traditional beliefs etc. Out of 461 tribes 62 tribes live in Orissa alone forming about 10.8% of thetribal population of India. The Orissa state occupies an important place being the 3rd in rank for high concentration of tribal population in the coun try. Hemoglobinopathies and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD)enzyme deficiency are important genetic and public health problems inOrissa. In order to map out these genetic disorders among the tribal peo ple 15 major tribal communities were randomly screened from differentparts of Orissa. High frequency of sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and G 6 PD deficiency the range being 0 22.4% and 5 15.9% respectively with ÃÂ§ thalassemia trait taking an intermediate position was observed in 15 majortribes. For G 6 PD deficiency males as well as females and both femaleheterozygote and homozygote cases were detected. Twelve casesshowed double heterozygosity for sickle hemoglobinopathy and G 6 PDdeficiency. The state of Orissa is one of the hyper endemic areas for malaria espe cially for Plasmodium falciparum. Moreover the inverse relationshipbetween the sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and G 6 PD deficiency in majortribal communities of Orissa is interesting one. When the frequency of sick le cell disorders decreases in the population the frequency of G 6 PDenzyme deficiency increases and vice versa. It seems that the NaturalSelection has played a major role in favour of sickle cell and G 6 PDenzyme mutations so that they have probably evolved as a protectivemechanism against the lethal effects of malaria in this part of the country. Intervention and genetic counselling strategies among these affected trib al communities are being planned and implemented for the control andprevention of hereditary hemolytic disorders. All the above related issueshave been discussed in this paper. ,2001
1114,The Bhoksas inhabit the Garhwal foot hills and the tarai areas of theKumaon division of newly formed State of Uttaranchal which was hither topart of State of Uttar Pradesh North India. Tharu another tribal group livesin close vicinity and shares the same eco zone and eco niche. Bhoksasare divisible in two subgroups the foot hill Bhoksas and the Tarai Bhoksas. Both these groups are maritally isolated. Tharus on the otherhand aredivisible into five sub groups viz. Rana Jogia Dangaria Kathuria andPachchimaha. These sub groups are also reproductively isolated. Anattempt has been made to compare two tribal groups namely the Bhoksasand Tharus on the basis of population composition like age sex maritalstatus education occupation etc. and population dynamics on the basis oftheir fertility and mortality. Further genetical considerations based on mar riage pattern mean marriage distance reproductive pattern and the oppor tunity of Natural Selection have also been studied. Many similarities anddifferences have been noted on the basis of population competition fertil ity mortality and genetic considerations. Further inter groupvariations have been found on the basis of above parameters between thefoot hill Bhoksas and Terai Bhoksas and also with the endogamous groupof Tharus. The opportunity of total selection is slightly low in the TaraiBhoksa as compared to Foot hill Bhoksa. However the Index of Mortalityis slightly higher in the Tarai group as compared to the foot hill group. Theindex of fertility is higher in Foot hill Bhoksas. With index of Mortality slight ly higher in the Tarai Bhoksa group and index of fertility higher in the Foothill group the total Opportunity for Selection is low among the Tarai Bhok sas as compared to the foothill group. On the other hand the five groups ofTharu tribals have a slightly higher level of the Index of Opportunity forselection. Thus it is clear that both groups of Bhoksas exhibit low Opportu nity of Selection as compared to the five groups of Tharus. ,2001
1115,The HLA DR and DQ antigen maximum likelihood gene frequency esti mates in 95 marattas revealed that HLA DR2 and DR7 had highest fre quency(0.27 0.15) while DR3 and DR9 had low frequency(0.04). HLA DR8was absent. HLA DQ1 and DQ2 presented with high frequen cy(0.40 0.13).Two locus haplotype frequency analysis revealed that DR2 DQ1 and DR7 DQ2 had highhaplotype frequency with significant Tvalue(>2) and in positive Linkage disequilibruim(LD).The haplotype DR4 DQ1 had less frequency with negative LD. Molecular Low resolution PCR SSP typing for DRB1 and DQB1 gene revealed thatDRB1*02 DRB1*07 DQB1*06 and DQB1*0203 had frequencies as17.85% 14.28% 50% and 12.5%. ,2001
1116,"In India the caste system is a living reality. The caste are characterized byhierarchy economic specialization and endogamy. The caste are dividedinto endogamous groups. These endogamous groups vary in their genefrequencies even though they share the same econiche. Principles ofendogamy regulate their gene pool and are normally not disturbed exceptby selection effect and mutation. In Uttar Pradesh like other parts of Indiathere are several endogamous groups of Brahmins. Probably these endog amous groups are split product of a larger group. Therefore in order toexamine the hypothesis that whether these endogamous groups are theproduct of fission of a common parental population or independent reali ties which have evolved during the course of time and continue to exist asindividual genetic isolates studies were made on their demographic mor phological and genetic traits. These traits indicate similarities between theBrahmin groups suggesting the belief of a common parental stock or orig inal oneness . The statistical test for natural selection (of Crow) Morpho logical distance T2(Of Sanghwi) and G2 for genetic distance(Sanghwi)were also used to assess quantitatively the biological affinities betweenthese groups. On the basis of these statistics it appears that probably theprocess of fission following adaptation to new ways of life has been at work( as historical evidence with various myths and legends also suggests) and resulted in the formation of different endogamous groups of Brahmins.296 Posters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population GeneticsP1006. Incidence of haemoglobin E in tribal population of Tripura especially among school children M. De1 B. Sengupta2 G. Talukder2 1Vivekananda Institute of Medical Sciences Calcutta India 2Vivekanan da Institute of Medical Sciences Calcutta I', 'Tripura a small state in the Eastern India close to Bangladesh with a pre dominant tribal population (80%) showed a high incidence of haemoglobin E in an unrelated cohort of age group between 7 to 70 years(1). Thisencouraged us to screen adolescent tribal school children with a view tostart counselling at an early age by agarose gel electrophores followed byPCR ARMS confirmation. This study comprised of 196 school childrenaged 9 to 14 years of both sexes showed 57.65% HbE carriers 20.41%homozygous E and normal 21.94%. The incidence of HbE has been estab lished to be the highest in the indigenous Tripuri and Tripuri Deb Barmantribes who have migrated to this area at an early date and are supposed tobe Tibeto Burmans with admixture of tribes from the West. Other tribeslike Chakma Neotia and Jamatia also showed HbE carrier status but thenumbers were not adequate. Study of a parallel cohort of 114 tribal andlocal populations have shown an increased incidence of E beta thalas saemia cases (10.53%) which was absent in our previous study (1). Thissuggests evidence of racial admixture with the surrounding beta thalas saemia carrier population which may pose a public health problem infuture. The HbE haplotypes found in Tripura has been established to be dif ferent from that found in West Bengal.2 This milder gene action opens uppossibilities of study of regulatory or interactive gene functions specially inthe populations belonging to over 30 40 tribal groups populating NorthEastern India.

1118,Genetic epidemiological data strongly indicate that Multiple sclerosis is acomplex trait. The most acceptable theory is that susceptibility to MS isinherited and environmental factors trigger the autoimmune process thatleads to the disease. Since the Sardinians are an ethnically homogeneouspopulation having a genetic structure quite different from that of other Ital ian and European populations we believed that this population could givean important contribution to the study of the disease s inheritance. Classi cal segregation analysis carried out on data from the population basedRegistry of Nuoro indicated that MS may be attributed to a possible auto somal recessive gene with reduced penetrance. This concept of incom plete penetrance can conceal a complex pattern the presence of moregenes with modifying effects may results in a reduced penetrance espe cially when the analysis is performed on a small sample. This hypothesisseems supported by complex segregation analysis. In fact after the split ting up of the sample according to parental mating type the polygenicmodel was the most suitable for crosses between unaffected parents whereas when one parent was affected the best fitting model was a mixedmodel with a polygenic component and a major locus. Segregation analy sis on MS may be considered only an exploratory tool since MS is a com plex entity. However our results based on classical and complex segrega tion analyses indicate that the possible genetic basis could be a polygenicsystem. This indication is in complete agreement with the well known com plexity of the disease. ,2001
1119,Substantial evidence suggests that the liability to attention deficit hyperac tivity disorder (ADHD) is highly heritable. To disentangle the complex sys tem of the determination of this latent quantitative trait it is critically impor tant to use informative phenotypic definitions. Item response theory iscapable of providing unbiased trait estimates that take into account boththe individual trait level and the properties of the trait s indicators (items).Segregation analysis in a sample of 602 families supported a transmissi ble but non Mendelian sex dependent effect for ADHD symptom count. Ina clinical subgroup of 184 pedigrees segregation analysis supported adominant Mendelian model. Factor analysis of the ADHD symptoms yield ed two factors representing the dimensions underlying ADHD liability (inat tention and hyperactivity impulsivity). Item response theory modeling wasapplied to derive latent trait estimates for the dimensions using informa tion from multiple instruments and raters. Measured genotype analysis(MGA) was conducted to examine the relationship between the latent traitsand polymorphisms at several candidate genes of the dopamine system ina sub sample of 169 Caucasian males. Significant association was detect ed between a polymorphism in the DRD2 gene and IRT derived indices ofattention (p=0.0249) and activity impulsiveness (p=0.0066). Moderateassociation was found between the DRD4 gene and the IRT derived atten tion index (p=0.0389). ,2001

1121,Antimutagenic properties of plasma and proteins (albumin and gamma globulin) of blood of men were studied using seeds of Crepis capillaris(chromosome aberration assay). Antimutagen p aminobenzoik acid wasused as a comparative reagent. Antimutagenic activity dependent on pro cessing conditions of the biosubstratum used for the pre processing andcombined processing antimutagenic effect was higher than for post pro cessing the processing properties of the blood being higher than those ofthe blood s proteins. Antimutagenic potential of biosubstrata did notdepend on mutation inductor. Complex forming properties of plasma andPosters: Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics 297blood albumen have been revealed using spectrophotometry through the substantial spectral displacement Ã¢\x80\x94 relative to the expected spectrum Ã¢\x80\x94 forthe mixture of biosubstrata and mutagens. All plasma albumin andgamma globulin concentrations have been shown using chemolumines cence to increase the generation of hydroxyl radical of the Fenton reagent especially for albumin in 1.0 g/l concentration. The general trend for allexperiments was that the said substances decreased the stimulating effectas their concentrations grew. Peroxidation of yolk lipoproteids showed thatonly high concentrations of blood s plasma and albumen have antioxidiz ing properties. gamma Globulin did nor reveal any ability to inhibit lipid per oxidation of yolk lipoproteids. Complex forming mechanisms of the blood salbumen and antioxidizing property of plasma and proteins of men havebeen proved to form the blood s amtimutagenic potential. ,2001
1122,After Chernobyl accident there are became accumulate the epidemiologi cal data on remote determined (tissue organs and organism) disturbancesin persons received low dose irradiation. This data can not be explainedwith classical radiation genetic positions as genetic damage appear insmall quantity undergo reparation and can not lead to such pathologyPurpose Study of cellular mechanisms of determinated nonstochasticconsequences of the action of a low dose irradiation. Material and meth ods Using electron microscopy myocardial capillary endothelium is stud ied in rats X ray irradiated at a relatively low dose of 0.5 Gy and 2.25 and4.5 Gy (total irradiation) and 9 30 48 and 100 Gy (irradiation of the car diac area). The observation time was 18 months (control 4.5 and 9 Gy) 12 months (0.5 and 2.25 Gy). 8 months (30 Gy) and one month (48 and100 Gy).Determined was frequecy (%) of the occurrence of endothelio cytes with signs of edematous degeneration intracellular lysis and isolat ed damage of mitochondria. Results The total irradiation of rats at a dose 0.5Gy as well as at higherdoses 2.25 and 4.5 Gy produces in the population on vascular endothe liocytes a persistent increase of the yield of damaged cells as comparedwith the background. This effect was characterized by an early appear ance irreversibility and dose independency. The damage was revealedwithout association with mitosis. The mean level of the amount of damagedcells during the observation time with the confidence interval [P=0.05] inthe control and after the total irradiation at the doses of 0.5 2.25 and 4.5Gy amounted to 1.29Ã¢\x80\x93 0.4 18.5 Ã¢\x80\x93 2.8 14.2 Ã¢\x80\x93 6.0 and 16.0 Ã¢\x80\x93 2.0 respec tively. The same regularities have been also established after theirradiationof the cardiac area at doses of 9 30 48 and 100Gy. Conclusion In mammals and humans the destabilization of such type isassumed to can cause expressed departure from physiological norms inslowly renewling tissues since the stable increasing of frequency cellsdeath can no compensate in its by proliferation processes. The hypothesisare suggested that these changes can play a significant role in the devel opment of low doses radiation consequences. ,2001
1123,Abstract pesticides use in developing countries is extensive in quantityand in time. A great deal of what is applied remains in the environment andin the organisms inhabiting it. This brings contamination and healthimpairment of those in contact with them. Effects can be manifested at ashort term and in the long run and symptoms range from a headache tocancer development. Much research has been directed to acute andchronic effects and more recently to the study of genotoxic effects of pes ticides. The objective of this work was to assess the genotoxicity of thosepesticides used in the packaging of bananas to which female workers areexposed using the single cell electrophoresis (or comet assay) as a bio logical marker in lymphocytes from their peripheral blood. The study pop ulation was 30 exposed females from 15 different banana farms and 28unexposed females as normal controls. According to our results there is asignificant damage to single stranded DNA after five years ofwork(R2=0.1210 p>0.001). The question is whether this comes from theactual exposures or from past exposures to other kind of pesticides. Nei ther was it possible to correlate dose and frequency of exposure to pesti cides with DNA damage since the national registries of kind of products the length of time of their use and the periods when they were used arevery deficient. Genetic monitoring to detect DNA damage through thecomet assay is recommended in order to surveillance the health of work ers in contact with pesticides. ,2001
1124,Starting in January 2000 the Chilean Ministry of Health legislated to addfolic acid (FA) to wheat flour (2.2 mg/kg). Chilean women of low socioeco nomic status (70% of the population) consume high amounts of bread(mean 200 g/day) which would provide 330 ug/day of FA. To determine theeffectiveness of this fortification we are monitoring folate status of childbearing age women and the rates of NTD in Chile. Folate status wasassessed in 750 women of reproductive age from low socioeconomic levelin Santiago before and one year after fortification. Frequencies of NTD willbe recorded from 1999 2000 (baseline) to 2002 in around 60.000births/year occurring in the nine public maternity hospitals of Santiago. Serum and red blood folates values of chilean women before fortificationare similar to those of US non supplemented women before grain FA forti fication (NHANES II). Samples to measure folate levels after fortification inthe same group were obtained recently. Results are being processed. Thefrequency of NTD in Santiago before fortification including year 1999 up toSeptember 2000 in 103.554 newborns (alive and stillbirths over 500 g ofbirth weight) was 1 69/1000. Rates were 1 32/1000 and 49 93/1000 in alivenewborns and in stillbirths respectively. Rates of each defect were anen cephaly 0 56/1000 encephalocele 0 25/1000 and spins bifida 0 88/1000.All defects were more frequent in females (61 1% vs 37 7 % p=0.001).According to folic acid supply from bread we expect that babies bornunder the effect of the intervention at conception will start by January 2001 so we will be able to show the results from the first trimester of 2001 at theCongress. *Supported by March of Dimes Center for Disease Control andPrevention Chilean Ministry of Health PAHO/WHO ,2001
1125,In some Palestinian communities the prevalence of inherited prelingualdeafness is among the highest in the world. As an initial step towardsunderstanding the genetic causes of hearing loss in the Palestinian popu lation 48 independently ascertained probands with bilateral non syn dromic hearing loss (NSHL) were evaluated for mutations in the connexin26 gene. Connexin 26 encodes the gap junction protein GJB2 and is themost common cause of recessively inherited NSHL worldwide. Of the 48Palestinian probands 11 (23%) were homozygous or compound heterozy gous for mutations in nan,2001
1126,OBJECTIVE According to the 1997 U. S. Census Bureau Hispanics arethe fastest growing ethnic group in the USA. Despite this fact they contin ue to be a relatively under served population in respect to genetic screen ing and prenatal diagnosis. To assess this issue further and possiblyimprove their care we studied the efficiency of our prenatal geneticscreening program by evaluating the number of invasive prenatal tesing(Amniocentesis/CVS procedures) performed after non directive geneticcounseling of Hispanic women referred for advanced maternal age (AMA) abnormal maternal serum markers (MSM) or abnormal fetal ultrasound(AU) evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Over the last 4 years 2525pregnant women were referred for genetic counseling. Of these 1256were Hispanic (50%) 871 African American (34%) 305 Caucasian (12%) and 93 (4%) of other ethnicities. 1866 patients (74%) were onMedicaid/uninsured. 663 of the Hispanic patients (52.7%) had a positivegenetic screening test 327 AMA 273 MSM and 63 AU. The remaining 593Hispanic patients were referred for other reasons including a family histo ry of genetic disorder exposure to teratogens recurrent pregnancy losses etc. RESULTS Overall 36% of the prenatally screened poitive Hispanicpatients elected to pursue further invasive testing to confirm the chromo somal status of their fetuses. This acceptance rate for invasive testingdepended on the indication for referral 57% for AU 33% AMA and 34.3%MSM. CONCLUSION From a public heatlh perspective the relatively lowacceptance rate of prenatal diagnosis calls into question the efficiency ofthe genetic screening program in Hispanic women. It is possible that mostof these women are not interested or do not understand the overall objec tives of the program. Further studies are needed to address these ques tions. ,2001
1127,Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C) is an autosomal reces sive disorder caused by mutations in the g sarcoglycan gene. A private Gypsy mutation C283Y was detected in that gene. Recently a number ofLGMD2C affected families from Gypsy origin have been found in East Bul garia and all these cases were due to the same mutation. We havescreened 303 individuals in a reproductive age from high risk XoroxaneGypsy group. The genetic tests revealed 8.3% C283Y heterozygote carri ers. The screened sample was not ethnically homogeneous but it wasdivided in ethnonym groups on the basis of a number of socio anthropo logical criteria social status language characteristics handicrafts etc. Wefound that the mutation C283Y was not randomly distributed among theGypsy subgroups. The disease seemed to be restricted to the group ofXoroxane Gypsies and geographically localized in East Bulgaria. Ourresults stress upon the importance to have a precise knowledge on thesocio anthropological structure of the group to be genetically analyzed especially when it concerned isolated endogamous populations (as it wasin our case). A number of important questions such as the origin of the eth nic subgroups the routs of migration the demographic history the sub group s endogamy isolation and admixture with surrounding populations remain open. ,2001
1128,Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policy 299The aim of this work is to investigate the extent of parents satisfaction with medical and social services provided for the families with a member withDown syndrome (DS families) and how they are coping with this situation. Material and Methods Fifty questionnaires filled by the DS families wereanalysed. The age of persons with DS was 5 months 28 years (mean age8.5 years) Results The clinical diagnosis of DS in most cases was madeat maternity hospitals by paediatricians who also gave the first informationabout the DS (in 82% of cases). Only 24% of parents were satisfied withthis information 76% of families would like to have more information andsupport. The cytogenetic diagnosis was made during the first month in50% of cases. In 4 cases (8%) diagnosis was confirmed later than oneyear. Only 22% of families were completely satisfied with social benefits. The home atmosphere became worse during the years in 44% of cases. However 70% of the families agreed to support other DS families. Con clusions The DS families need more information about DS and support especially right after the diagnosis have been established and more possi bilities for habilitation and social help. Most of the parents are ready to sup port other families and share their knowledge and skills. ,2001
1129,For over a decade prevention of the common genetic disorders was anational programme in Iran. The result of our ten years study on carrieridentification and prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases has revealed theexistence of a wide spectrum of mutations for certain diseases in this coun try. This is a reflection of Iran s long history of foreign invasion immigration cultural exchange and also the high prevalence of interfamilial marriages creating a multiethnic society with a highly heterogenous gene pool. Dur ing the last three years investigation we have established a DNA bank ofall genetic diseases with Mendelian mode of inheritance studied in Iran. Some of these samples are assigned to common or novel mutations andsome others belong to patients with clinical profiles associated with a par ticular genetic disease but unidentified mutation. This bank stores patientand his/her first degree relatives DNA together with a comprehensive pedi gree and a clinical profile for each sample. To improve our diagnostics wefound it essential to establish a link between our findings and the otherresearch projects elsewhere in the world by presenting our experimentalprojects and this DNA bank on line. Our web site as well as providingopportunities for us to collaborate with outside offers a free of charge valu able sample resource to all the researchers in the world who are workingon various aspects of genetic disorders from prenatal diagnosis to genestructure and function.

1131,Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is heritable connective tissue disordercaused in >90% cases by dominant mutations in two genes COL1A1(17q21.31 22.05) and COL1A2 (7q21.3 22.1). The aim of the study was toimprove postnatal and prenatal diagnosis of OI in Lithuania using molecu lar genetic testing. Lithuanian OI database consists of 110 case records. Thirteen familial and eight sporadic dominant OI cases were available formolecular genetic testing. The segregation of COL1A1 and COL1A2 wasanalysed using RFLP within or close to the genes. Comparison of pheno typic features with the concordant collagen locus showed that in threepedigrees Sillence OI type I segregated with the COL1A1 locus while intwo pedigrees Sillence OI type I and OI type IV segregated with theCOL1A2 locus. In eight remaining pedigrees the data available were insuf ficient for the identification of a definite OI linked COL1A locus. Probandsfrom 11 OI families and eight sporadic OI patients were screened for muta tions in 26 exons of the COL1A1 gene using DNA heteroduplex analysis. The results showed the presence of nucleotide sequence changes segre gating with the OI phenotype in six probands. Subsequent direct DNAsequencing revealed six mutations in four exons of the COL1A1 gene mis sense (1) nonsense (1) frameshift (3) and splice site mutation (1). Out ofthem five mutations appeared to be novel E500X c.2165 2166insCTCTCTAG c.1787delT c.1786 1787insC IVS19+1G>A. Thesefindings confirm clinical diagnosis of OI and enable prenatal OI diagnosisbased on direct identification of a COL1A1 gene mutation in six families. ,2001
1132,As scientists increase our ability to diagnose genetic conditions precon ditions and susceptibilities lawyers and ethicists increase our questionsand concerns regarding the societal implications of these new capabilities. This presentation will address those questions and concerns as they arisein the practice of clinical genetics. For example who decides when a newgenetics test becomes the standard of care? What does the standard ofcare require i.e. when must clinical cancer geneticists advise patientsregarding the availability of a new test must they offer the test? Whoshould/should not be tested? How do we protect the right not to know? What about children? What constitutes informed and voluntary consentto genetic testing? Who do the genetic test results belong to and what mustbe done to protect privacy and ensure security? Is there a duty to warnpotential carriers of disease predisposing genes and if so what if that dutyconflicts with the duty of confidentiality? What obligations do we have toprior patients? What if something goes wrong? ,2001
1133,To completely characterize the spectrum of mutations in the ATP7B genein Greek Wilson disease (WD) patients we screened 150 Greek WDchromosomes by SSCP. 18 mutations were identified accounting for 85%of WD chromosomes. H1069Q (29.3%) R969Q (17.3%) Q289X (9.3%) L936X (7.3%) 2530delA (5.3%) I1148T (3.3%) 2299insC (2.7%) 1708 1G>A (2.0%) 845delT (1.3%) Ter1466R (1.3%) and mutations1703+3insC G1099S 777insC 1782delT 2101delAT G1061E R778G300 Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policyand 3907 2A>G for 0.7% each while 15% of the mutations remain unknown. Subsequently we developed a universal high throughput doublegradient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis system (DG DGGE) forthe analysis of 80% of WD mutations in Greece. Exons 2 4 8 10 12 13 14 and 16 were PCR amplified. Heteroduplexes were generated at the endof each PCR session and amplified DNA samples were electrophoresed ina linear porosity gradient 6 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of thesame linear gradient of denaturants urea and formamide as used for stan dard DGGE. The DG DGGE conditions used were the following denatu rants 20 70% for exons 2 4 10 and 12 and 30 80% for exons 14 13 and16. Running conditions were 75V for 15 h. In addition exons 10 and 12and 14 and 16 were double loaded. Following electrophoresis gels werestained in ethidium bromide. Using DG DGGE together with the highlyinformative microsatellite markers in linkage with the ATP7B gene(D13S301 D13S316 D13S314) we are able to offer genotype analysisand preclinical diagnosis to the vast majority of Greek WD families. ,2001
1134,The growth of genetic testing over the last decade has created a need forquality control and external assessment of results. An ever increasingrepertoire of genetic loci can be examined for association with geneticabnormalities cancer predisposition disease status and prognosis. Thismeans that laboratories that are proficient in one area are assumed to bequalified in testing areas that may be very far removed from their area ofprevious experience. Some important criteria for assessing a test will need to be addressedmore formally. Issues of particular importance are fitness for purpose canthe test yield the desired information? What are the limits of the test interms of specificity selectivity and detection? Does sample origin com plexity of the sample matrix or its storage have any effect on the result? Has the result been accurately interpreted? Can we assign a confidencelimit based on our previous data? Statistical analysis of the performanceof a method and calculation of an uncertainty budget could enable moreinformed genetic counselling and prevent the inappropriate application orextrapolation of some genetic test results. In order to deliver the potential advantages of genetic testing to society andimprove public perception of test results it is important to demonstrate thequality and reliability of the test. Proficiency testing schemes and the useof reference materials or certified test samples are possible routes to har monisation of testing procedures. ,2001
1135,Advances in DNA analysis to develop methods which are increasingly spe cific sensitive fast simple automatable and cost effective are consideredparamount. These demands are currently driving the rapid evolution of adiverse range of newer technologies. One such advance is the develop ment of technologies with the ability to amplify detect and quantitate DNAtargets in a single closed tube reaction as PCR proceeds. These real timehomogeneous systems offer many advantages over traditional methodsincluding speed reduced risk of contamination and the ability to moreaccurately quantitate the amount of starting material present. As rapidtechnological advances produce systems which are capable of increasedsensitivity throughput and quantitative potential new sets of validationissues need to be addressed. These include the reproducibility of the tech niques both intra and inter laboratory sensitivity accuracy precision andthe interpretation of data where arbitrary selection of cut off points to sep arate positive and negative results are often employed. Under the DTI sValid Analytical Measurement (VAM) programme LGC has been identify ing recent developments which may have an impact on the future of clini cal DNA based diagnostics. This presentation will highlight some of themost popular homogeneous technologies currently making the transitionfrom the research laboratory to the clinical laboratory and discuss keyaspects in their validation. ,2001
1136,Three fragile sites FRAXA FRAXE and FRAXF are located on the chro mosomal region Xq27 28 that result from repeat expansion. Phenotypicexpression concurs with the methylation of the expansion and the promot ers of the respective genes FMR1 FMR2 and FRAXF sequences. BothFRAXA and FRAXE are significant forms of mental retardation whereasthe significance of the FRAXF expansion is unclear so far. In contrast toFRAXA the most prevalent form of inherited mental retardation in males whereas FRAXE and FRAXF are extremely rare. Therefore it has beenquestioned whether screening for the two rare forms is warranted. Never theless it is important to distinguish the one from the others. We havetherefore devised a multiplex MS PCR strategy that allows the simultane ous evaluation of the de novo promoter methylation of all three promoters. It consists of primer sets that are specific for the deaminated methylatedpromoter regions of FRAXA FRAXE and FRAXF as well as a primer pairthat is specific for the unmethylated FMR1 promoter. Our approach distin guishes between normal and affected FRAXA FRAXE and FRAXF malessolely based on the respective band patterns. Female full mutation carrierscan be identified by a densitometric analysis of the PCR products on gelsstained with ethidium bromide. So far we have screened more than 500DNA samples from patients referred to for the diagnostic evaluation ofFRAXA Prader Willi and Angelman syndrome. Amongst these samples we identified seven patients with FRAXA but none with FRAXE or FRAXF. ,2001

There is a critical need for validated standardsaccessible to laboratories offering these tests. The Coriell Cell Reposito ries through the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository and the NIA AgingCell Repository have a collection of more than 600 cell lines and DNA sam ples representing 72 diseases with characterized mutations which could beused as standards. These include diseases caused by expansion of trinu cleotide repeats such as dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (for whichthree samples with known repeats are available) myotonic dystrophy (13) Friedreich ataxia (10) fragile X syndrome (26) Huntington Disease (13) SCA1 (2) and SCA3 (2). The collection also includes 32 different muta tions in the CFTR gene 20 unique mutations in the BRCA1 gene 6 muta tions in the BRCA2 gene and 4 mutations in the APC gene. Samples frompatients with hemochromatosis (19) muscular dystrophy (11) spinal mus Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policy 301cular atrophy (3) Angelman syndrome (4) and Prader Willi syndrome (12) have also been molecularly characterized. In addition specimens carryingthe factor V Leiden mutation (2) the MTHFR thermolabile variant (2) andthe 20210G A polymorphism in the prothrombin gene (2) are also includedin the collection. Standards are also available for apolipoprotein E and RhD genotyping.

After invasive diagnostic the classical cytogenet ic karyotyping of amniotic cell cultures takes about 10 14 days. To get aquicker diagnosis detection result of these aneuploidies there are twocommon methods the FISH technique and the multiplex fluorescence PCR test. Using the multiplex f PCR test results of the chromosomes13 18 21 and XY are presentable in only 18 hours in urgent cases in 5hours after amniocentesis. Only 1ml of amnotic fluid is necessary for per forming the test. It is possible to use the test on amniotic cells after the 11thweek. Three multiplex f PCRs include fifteen different STRs (tri andtetranucleotid repeats) four highly polymorphic STR markers are used forthe chromosomes 13 18 21 three for XY. The PCR products are analysedon the ABI 310. From 07.99 to 11.00 we carried out 800 tests in our labo ratory. These 800 results were confirmed by the classical cytogenetic kary otypig. We detected 11 trisomies 21 1 trisomy 13 and 2 trisomies 18 which were also confirmed by routine cytogenetics. In our laboratory themultiplex f PCR method is replacing the FISH technique more and more. In comparison to FISH the multiplex f PCR method is less expensive lesstimeresuming and more sensitive. In addition it is more comfortable for ourpatients to get a result for the most common aneuploidies that fast. ,2001
1139,External quality assessments (EQAs) have been organized for severalgenetic diseases and demonstrated the importance of continued efforts toimprove quality in molecular diagnostic laboratories including regular par ticipation in EQA. It can thus be expected that more EQA schemes will(need to) be organised in the future also because the number of diseaseswhich can be molecularly diagnosed is increasing rapidly. The objective ofthe present study was to evaluate the costs of organising an EQA. Thisanalysis was based on the 5 years experience with European EQAs forcystic fibrosis (1996 2000 see also Nature Genet 2000 25 259 260). Thetotal cost was separated in personnel costs and material costs (laboratoryreagents administration travel). A further separation was made betweenfixed costs (independent of participants number) and variable costs (costper participant in addition to fixed cost). The results of the analysis showthat the fixed personnel time required for the EQA organisation is highcompared to the additional personnel time required per participant (the lat ter is less than 1% of the fixed time). Similarly the variable material costper participant is low (less than 0.5%) compared to the fixed material costfor the organisation of an EQA. Given the relative high fixed costs for theorganisation of an EQA we conclude that a high number of participants(e.g. >100) is required in order to enable cost efficient organisations ofEQAs. Furthermore one might hypothesize that the organisation of EQAwhich cover several diseases simultaneously could further optimize thiscost efficiency.

1140,In this time of extraordinary advances in molecular genetics the clinicalclassifications and codifications of genetic disorders are still heteroge neous and confusing. In 1991 (8th ICHG meeting Washington) the mainauthor proposed the use of a multiaxial diagnostic system (MADS) in clin ical genetics. For simplicity only four major categorical axes (I Phenotyp ic II Pathogenetic III Etiologic and IV Differential Diagnoses) weredefined. The major advantages of such a system include improved diag nostic accuracy greater homogeneity of the diagnostic categories enhancing the comparison of diagnostic achievements among differentcenters regions or countries more specific definitions for controversialterms user friendliness as it organizes the usual diagnostic information ina systematic and logical way and does not require further skills ease ofmodification and improvement to keep it consistent with advances. Wehave also shown that the system is an excellent aid in teaching clinicalgenetics (Lacassie Y. An International Multiaxial Diagnostic System inClinical Genetics. In Dysmorphology and Genetics of Cardiovascular Dis orders. Zerbinis Athens 1994). Although it was not an original goal theMADS also can be used to improve the current International Classificationof Diseases (ICD 9). We recently reviewed the diagnoses on 4352patients representing 88% of the patients seen in our division betweenNovember 1986 and June 2000. We will discuss this experience regardingthe classification and distribution of genetic diseases and birth defects dueto environmental causes advocating the international use of this system. ,2001
1141,The necessity of quality control (QC) is not obscure especially for the ref erence laboratories that are the centers of refered doubtfull or broderlineresults. In our center which is one of the two national referral centers forthalassemia (a&b) and the only reference lab where routine hematologicalinvestigations are achieved in association with molecular diagnostics forprenatal diagnosis and carrier detection of haemoglobin disorders QC hasa great importance. QC in our laboratories is achieved by the presence ofinstrument booklets laboratory manuals containing standard methods useof high quality materials and kits use of external and internal control mate rial for hematology biochemistry and genetics tests control material forcalibrating the instruments regular analysis of instrument performances the use of all available techniques in parallel if necessary and sequencingas the gold standard and daily weekly & monthly QC data analysis. Thesehave helped us to minimize the lab errors. Since the routine hematologyprocedures such as complete blood count (including RBC indices) Hbelectrophoresis & HbA2 measurements are achieved for screening of tha lassemia correct results sometimes prevent unnecessary expensive timeconsuming & specific molecular diagnostic procedures. When the hemato logical investigation proved thalassemia then specific molecular tech niques run to detect mutations known and unknown. In our highly qualitycontrolled environment less than five percent lab errors has been observedduring the last six months. ,2001

Comparison of Biochemical and Molecular Testing for Tay Sachs Disease T. L. Stockley J. Callahan J. T. R. Clarke P. N. Ray The Hospital for Sick Children Toronto ON C', 'Tay Sachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused bydeficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A and is most prevalent in theAshkenazi Jewish population (carrier rate 1/30). Carrier screening for Tay Sachs is available by biochemical analysis of hexosaminidase activity inblood. However the biochemical assay is complicated by several difficul ties such as inaccurate results for women who are pregnant or using birthcontrol pills. As well individuals who carry non pathogenic pseudodefi ciency mutations are reported as Tay Sachs carriers by use of the bio chemical assay. Due to these difficulties molecular analysis of mutationsin the HEXA gene is an important compliment to biochemical screening inorder to resolve these issues. We are conducting a large scale study tocompare the effectiveness of biochemical and molecular testing for Tay Sachs disease. Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are tested by bothstandard biochemical testing and molecular testing for three common path ogenic mutations [1278insTATC IVS12(+1)G>C and 805G>A (G269S)]and two pseudodeficiency alleles [739C>T (R247W) and 745C>T(R249W)]. In order to feasibly test this number of individuals we havedeveloped a rapid molecular diagnostic assay using allele specific amplifi cation methodology. To date we have tested >1000 individuals by both thebiochemical and molecular assay. In the carrier range by biochemicalanalysis (0 to 49.9% HexA) 80% of individuals have one of the five muta tions identified by the molecular assay while only 8.5% of individuals in theinconclusive range by biochemical analysis (50 to 55% HexA) have identi fied mutations. Sequencing of the hexosaminidase gene in individuals whoare carriers by biochemical analysis but who do not have one of the fivecommon mutations will be necessary to determine if these individuals arecarriers of rare hexosaminidase A mutations. In the biochemical non carri er range (>55% HexA) 1 individual was found to be a carrier of the path ogenic 1278insTATC mutation and 1 individual who identified as Ashke nazi Jewish was found to be a carrier of the pseudodeficiency mutationR247W. The identification of individuals in the non carrier range by bio chemical analysis who have pathogenic mutations suggests that molecu lar analysis may be a necessary adjunct to current biochemical testing pro grams. The results and implications of the study to date will be presented. ",2001
1143,Friedreich s ataxia (FRDA) is the most common of the autosomal recessivespinocerebellar ataxias with an estimated frequency of 1 in 50000 in theEuropean populations. More than 95% of FRDA cases are caused by largehomozygous expansions of a (GAA)n triplet repeat in the first intron of thefrataxin gene. Expanded (GAA)n repeats associated with the FRDA phe notype may be detected by Southern blot analysis or PCR based analysis. Southern blot analysis is reliable but requires large amounts of DNA and isa time consuming procedure. Long range PCR is not reliable for the detec tion of expansion carriers since preferential amplification of the normal(GAA)n repeat allele has been observed. Detection of large (GAA)n repeatexpansions by fluorescent triplet repeat primed PCR (TP PCR) has recent ly been introduced. We hereby present a modified TP PCR method forlaunching a carrier population screening program for FRDA in the Paphosdistrict of Cyprus. The TP PCR product of expanded (GAA)n repeat allelesgives a characteristic trace (smearing) on an agarose gel thus enabling therapid identification of large pathogenic GAA repeats. In conclusion wepresent a reliable simple fast and inexpensive method for the detectionof FRDA (GAA)n repeat expansions. ,2001
1144,Overview of the present achievements problems and obvious pitfalls inquickly expanded area of predictive medicine. On the ground of geneticnets of some common multifactorial disorders original data dealing withpredictive testing of endometriosis (E) osteoporosis (O) bronchial asth ma(BA) are presented. Genetic testing of the functionally inferior alleles ofdetoxification ( environmental) genes such as glutathione S transferasesM1 (GSTM1) and N acethytransferase 2 ( NAT 2) was found to be veryinformative for elaboration of efficient treatment strategy for E genetic test ing of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms turned to be very useful in pre diction of inherited predisposition to BA while testing of three major genes participating in osteogenesis ( VDR 3 COL1A1 & CALCR) gives a chanceto reveal individuals prone to O. Overepresantation of some detoxificationsystem alleles in the patients with chronic bronchitis among pregnantwomen with repeated miscarriages as well as in cystic fibrosis patients withsever lung complications is shown. Exponential growth of genetic tests their wide and frequently non critical application opens highly risky avenuefor their misuse and misinterpretation. Some already existing regulations ingene testing policy in Europe and its position in the present Russia arebriefly outlined. ,2001
1145,"The genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S transferase M1 (GSTM1) glutathione S transferase T1 (GSTT1) and cytochrome P4501A1 genesresponsible for xenobiotic conjugating enzymes of Phase II and Phase Idetoxification system were studied by PCR RFLP in 49 adult patients withatopic asthma sensitive to the house dust. The control group consisted of66 individuals of Russian origin living in St. Petersburg. We haven t foundsignificant dif ference for IleÃ¢\x80\x94Val polymorphism of CYP1A1 g ene. The analysis of the genes coding Phase II detoxification system enzymes have shown that the frequency of GSTM1 gene deletion was significantlyhigher for asthmatic patients (75 5% versus 41 0% in control p=0.001).Individuals with absence of the GSTM1 gene were at approximately4 5Ã¢\x80\x94fold higher risk of developing asthma (OR=4 45 95%CI=2 01 9 83).Proportion of glutathione S transferase theta null genotypes (GSTT10/0)appeared to be significantly increased in the group of asthmatics (77 6%)compared to controls (23 5%) with an OR of 11 7 (95%CI=5 13 26 88).Concordance of both GSTM1 0/0 and GSTT10/0 homozygotes wasrecorded in 61 2% of genotypes in the group of asthmatic patients and onlyin 9 1% of the control group .The comparable OR in the presence of bothnull genotypes was 15 8 (95%CI=6 37 39 12). Thus strong association ofatopic asthma with null alleles of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes was proved inthe present study. Molecular analysis of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes poly morphism might be useful for presymptomatic prediction of atopic asthma. Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policy 303P1042. Evaluation of the predictive value of the diagnostic cri teria for the Marfan syndrome (MFS) with respect to the out come of fibrillin 1 mutation analysis. A. De Paepe B. Loeys I. Delvaux S. De Bie L. Nuytinck University Hospital Ghent Gent B', 'We have performed a clinical and molecular study in 200 consecutivepatients referred with a diagnosis or suspicion of MFS. Careful clinicalevaluation against the Gent Nosology showed that 108 patients fulfilled thediagnosis of MFS whereas 92 patients were diagnosed with a Marfan related condition. An FBN1 mutation was found in 69 patients with the clin ical diagnosis of MFS (68 %). In several MFS families in which no mutationcould be identified the disease segregated with the FBN1 locus. The onlysignificant difference observed in MFS patients with and without a mutationwas the incidence of ectopia lentis (p < 0.04). No correlation was foundbetween the type and location of the FBN1 mutation and the severity of thephenotype. Ten mutations were found in the patients not fulfilling the diag nosis of MFS 2 patients with predominant ectopia lentis 1 with mitral valveprolapse syndrome 1 with isolated aortic aneurysm and 6 in a group ofyoung children with emerging MFS which were too young to fulfill thediagnostic criteria. Our results show a significant difference in the numberof FBN1 mutations in patients fulfilling versus not fulfilling the diagnosticcriteria for MFS. The findings underscore the need for careful clinical fol low up over time especially in young children at risk before excluding thediagnosis of MFS. Further molecular studies by gene sequencing and link age analysis in a selected group of MFS patients without an FBN1 muta tion are currently ungoing in order to resolve the question about locus het erogeneity in MFS.

1146,Genetic factors have been identified to account for up to 80% of bone min eral density variance in young adults. It was reported that polymorphism inthe vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene is associated with the disposition forthe development of osteoporosis. So far several mutations have beenidentified within the VDR gene. One mutation detectable by restriction frag ment polymorphism (Bsm I) in intron 8 have been described to be associ ated with bone mineral density. With the help of genotyping methods it ispossible to identify the predisposition of osteoporotic risk factors rapidly. Inthis investigation we report about a rapid method for the detection of vita min D receptor mutation in intron 8 based on real time PCR technology. We have developed a simple protocol specific for this mutation which makeit possible to differentiate between bb Bb or BB (homozygous mutation)genotypes. While the wild type corresponds to high bone mineral densitythe mutated allele could be associated with low bone mineral density. Thisprocedure enables us to identify osteoporotic risk persons at an earlystage. In addition this test system is a genetic diagnostic service of ourcompany. ,2001
1147,The mapping of loci conferring liability to single gene disorders and com mon conditions of complex inheritance is now done primarily for commer cial reasons. The participation of a research subject involves only provisionof a blood sample and health and pedigree data physical risk and incon venience to subjects are negligible. For these reasons conventional mod els of compensation for research participation are not appropriate. Partici pation cannot be expected to be altruistic given the commercial basis ofthe research. Nor is it appropriate to limit compensation to reimbursementfor the costs the subject incurs by participating (such as lost income andtravel expenses) or to limit compensation to a (low) notional wage paid forthe time and effort of participation. Genome research companies some times provide population level inducements to relatively small and geneti cally isolated populations (for instance health care facilities or services) oroffer future treatment at no cost to families in which single gene disordersoccur. These compensation approaches cannot readily be generalized tostudies in large populations or to studies of common disorders of complexinheritance. An appropriate alternative compensation model treats individ uals and families DNA as a resource in their possession which a genome research company may wish to extract. Compensation can be based onpotential or actual profits from exploitation of the resource that is profits from the sale of therapies developed from the knowledge the genomicstudy provides. Compensation would appropriately take the form of alump sum payment for access to a participant s DNA royalties or somecombination. These alternatives would remit an appropriate portion of prof its to a research subject. Such a compensation regime would result in pay ment to research subjects considerably larger than those commonly madenow. Sample calculations which allow for the probability of success of indi vidual research studies and an equal division of profit between the com pany and research subjects suggest compensation for DNA access of atleast $50 000 per research subject royalties in the order of 0.005% ofannual profit from sales of the product or a combination of these options.

1148,The human genome project has resulted in the isolation of several thou sand genes involved in human disease. These results raise new possibili ties for precise molecular diagnosis of genetic disorders and hence forgenetic counselling and therapeutic intervention. Consequently there is anincreasing demand for high throughput mutation detection methods. Here we present a method for large scale mutation screening based on auto mated single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis by cap illary array electrophoresis with multicolour fluorescence detection. Themethod was developed and tested using a commercially available 16 cap illary array system (ABI3100). This setup allows for unattended screeningof 576 samples at three temperatures in less than 24 hours. Each geno type results in a distinct highly reproducible conformation pattern whichallows for automated scoring of known allelic variants using dedicated soft ware. Re analysis of known mutations in the MYH7 gene associated withhypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed that screening at three different tem peratures (18ÃÂ¡C 25ÃÂ¡C and 35ÃÂ¡C) was necessary for 100% sensitivity. Weused the method to screen 130 South African probands with hypertrophiccardiomyopathy for mutations in the TNNI3 gene and found one novelR186Q missense mutation and nine novel single nucleotide polymor phisms ,2001
1149,"This qualitative study describes the experiences of cystic fibrosis (CF) car rier couples prospectively identified in CF families in order to explore theirexperiences with genetic testing and counselling and the impact on repro ductive behaviour and family relations. Of 12 couples identified until 1997 7 couples participated in semi structured interviews and 2 couples filled outquestionnaires 2 6 years after receipt of test results. After receiving theresults most couples reported that they were shocked because they didnot expect to be both carriers. More anxiety was expressed by those whowere pregnant (n=4) at the time of testing. Some subjects reported diffi culties in disclosing the results to family members. The reactions of familymembers were not always supportive. After testing all viable pregnancies(16 in 8 couples) were monitored by prenatal diagnosis and all thoseaffected were terminated (6 in 4 couples). Some couples perceived loss ofreproductive expectations. For couples having children after testing con cerns about the correctness of results of prenatal diagnosis during infancyand how to inform the children may emerge. Couples generally reported apositive counselling experience although dissatisfaction was reported onthe psychological guidance during pregnancy. Most couples did not regrettesting. In general couples supported the idea of screening although var ious concerns were expressed. The results suggest a favour for testingoutside pregnancy. The findings may be useful to explore possible dilem mas raised by the introduction of population screening. Observationsreported here also might apply to other recessively inherited disorders. 304 Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public PolicyP1047. Cftr Mutation Scanning By Denaturing Hplc V. M. Howell A. Proos F. Beach C. Jensen G. Watts L. Burnett Royal North Shore Hospital St Leonards A', 'Testing for cystic fibrosis mutations is a cumbersome process. Over 900mutations have been detected but our testing is currently restricted to the25 most common mutations in the European population. We have evaluat ed a reverse phase ion paired denaturing HPLC system for the detectionof mutations in the CFTR gene. Following amplification fragments aredenatured and slowly re annealed to ensure the formation of heteroduplexand homoduplex species if a mutation is present. The renatured productsare injected into the HPLC in the presence of an ion pairing reagent. Thisallows the DNA to bind to the polymeric stationary phase. The negativelycharged DNA is eluted against an increasing gradient of acetonitrile and isdetected by a change in the absorbance at 260nm. Under partially dena turing conditions (created by increasing the temperature of the column) the less stable heteroduplexes elute from the column earlier than the morestable homoduplexes. When only 1 species is present in a fragment thechromatogram will show only 1 peak. A heterozygous sample will show upto 4 peaks representing the 2 heteroduplex and 2 homoduplex populationspresent. We evaluated this system by screening 6 CFTR exons containing17 known mutations. The mutations consisted of substitutions 1 2 and 3bp deletions and a 2 bp insertion. Following optimisation all 17 mutationswere detected. We found denaturing HPLC to be a rapid economical andhighly sensitive technique for mutation scanning and plan to extend ourCFTR testing to include mutation scanning. ",2001
1150,Objective. A cohort of 21 unrelated index patients with familial hypercho lesterolaemia (FH) were screened for mutations in the low density lipopro tein receptor (LDLR) gene in order to define the spectrum of mutationsunderlying the FH phenotype in the South African Jewish population. Methods. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification fordetection of the prevalent South African founder mutations was applied followed by heteroduplex single strand conformation polymorphism (HEX SSCP) analysis and/or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) inmutation negative samples to identify LDLR gene defects in South AfricanJews with clinical signs of FH. Results. The FH Lithuania mutation(652delGGT) reported in the majority of South African Jews with FH wasdetected in 57% (12/21) of the index cases studied. Seven of the remain ing nine index patients were subjected to extensive mutation analysis ofthe LDLR gene and mutations Q64X Q104W D206E IVS9+1G? A N407K V408M and IVS14+5G? A were identified. In all samples exten sively examined mutations were detected. Mutation N407K is associatedwith a mild FH phenotype. Conclusions. Although the high frequency of80% previously reported for mutation 652delGGT in the South African Jew ish population may be an overestimation predominance of this deletion mutation (75%) was confirmed in FH patients of Lithuanian origin and ahigh sensitivity of extensive combined mutation screening strategiesdemonstrated. ,2001
1151,Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the deletion/deletion(DD) genotype of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene mayincrease the risk of myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease(CHD) in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). We determinedthe frequency of this polymorphism in South African Afrikaners with FH andpopulation matched controls in an attempt to determine the appropriate ness of multilocus genotyping in CHD risk assessment. Methods. Thegenotype distribution of the ACE polymorphism was compared in 205 FHheterozygotes 45 FH homozygotes and 215 controls (including 95 elderlysubjects) of the same population. All the FH patients were heterozygous orhomozygous for one of the founder related low density lipoprotein recep tor (LDLR) gene mutations D154N D206E or V408M. Results. The ACEDD genotype was detected at a significantly lower frequency in the FH het erozygotes (P<0.004) compared with younger controls. No significant dif ferences were observed in FH homozygotes (P<0.175) (when comparedwith the younger control group) and between FH patients with and withoutCHD. Allelic distribution differed significantly between the two controlgroups (P<0.031) with the I allele predominantly in the elderly. Conclu sions. Comparative analysis of molecularly characterised FH patients andpopulation matched controls may represent a useful study approach toreveal clinically relevant allelic differences. The potential for differentdegrees of linkage disequilibrium of the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) poly morphism with other potentially significant sequence changes in the geneand the modest degree of increased risk for CHD associated with the ACEDD genotype argues against the likelihood of this marker being a clinical ly useful indicator of increased risk for CHD in Afrikaner FH patients. ,2001

Incorporating biparietal diameter measurements into risk calculations for open neural tube defects potentialimpact in publicly funded care C. Meier1 A. M. S. Summers2 P. R. Wyatt2 1Ontario Maternal Serum Screening Database Toronto ON Canada 2North York General Hospital Toronto ON Canada ', 'Women in Ontario are routinely offered second trimester maternal serumscreening (MSS) during their pregnancies. MSS provides pregnancy spe cific chemistry adjusted risks for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) trisomy 18(Edward syndrome) and open neural tube defects (ONTDs). About 65 000patients are seen per annum. The risk assigned for ONTDs is based on thebackground prevalence gestational age and maternal serum alpha feto protein (MSAFP) MoM value. This risk is also adjusted for other factors(race multiple gestation insulin dependent diabetes). Gestational age isbased on LMP or ultrasound dating. The calculated (posterior) risk forONTDs has historically been based on the combined prevalence of bothanencephaly and spina bifida (in Ontario both prevalences are approxi mately 0.5 per 1 000). By excluding the risk of anencephaly by the use ofsoftware modifications a more accurate risk can be presented to patients. The purpose of this study was to model the impact of such a risk adjust ment using the Ontario Maternal Serum Screening Database. Of the254 833 women screened in a five year interval from November 1 st1995 to October 31st2000 114 760 57% received some kind of dating ultra sound in their pregancy. 40% of these dating ultrasounds were based onBPD which was recorded on their initial MSS form. Up to 75% of all preg nancies dated by ultrasound were late enough (10w6d) to warrant usingBPD. Of the 57 350 dated by BPD 2.5% or 1 412 had a positive screenresult. If the risk for NTDs for these women was modified to exclude anen cephaly only 756 or 1.3% would have screened positive. If ultrasonogra phers had been encouraged to use BPD wherever possible and had doneso 1 279 fewer screen positives would have been seen and the overallpositive rate for NTDs would have dropped from 2.5% to 1.6% whileaffording pregnant women more accurate risk figures and a similar detec tion rate for NTDs. Given the expense of and anxiety generated by falsepositives the adoption of BPD dating and additional markers and theirincorporation into screening algorithms is recommended particularly insystems supported by public taxation.

1154,The human genome project and technological advances in the biomedicalfield have resulted in the discovery of a multitude of genes and the meansto identify mutations predictive and causative of disease. In the UnitedStates these advances have led to concerns regarding the accuracy availability use of and access to genetic testing by the Public. To addressthese issues the Task Force on Genetic Testing later superceded by theSecretary s Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing were established. These groups working together with professional organizations and theprivate sector formulated recommendations toward ensuring the safetyand effectiveness of genetic testing. The recommendations advocate theavailability of appropriate education for the Public and health careproviders assurances for appropriate informed consent protection againstgenetic discrimination additional safeguards to ensure quality in laborato ry practices and the continued involvement of the Public in the decisionmaking process. Accordingly the Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention the Health Care Financing Administration and the Food and DrugAdministration have taken on the responsibility to evaluate and formulatepolicies and regulations that address issues surrounding the use of genet ic laboratory services. A process is being developed to ensure that genet ic tests introduced into clinical and Public health practices are analyticallyand clinically valid and have clinical utility. Also recommendations poli cies and regulations are being developed to ensure laboratories offeringgenetic tests are appropriately credentialed. These efforts are being under taken to ensure public access to quality genetic tests and allow the con tinued development of new genetic tests. ,2001
1155,Mutations in the PKD1 gene on chromosome 16p13.3 cause the mostcommon form of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).Patients from 55 Hellenic families from Greece and Cyprus were investi gated in our laboratory. The unique part and part of the reiterated region ofthe PKD1 gene were screened for mutations by SSCP analysis. The partof the duplicated region under investigation included exons 16 22 and 23 33. These were obtained by Long Range PCR utilizing unique PKD1primers. Three nonsense mutations were identified in exons 40 44 and 45(W3794X R4020X C4986X). Nonsense mutations were not found in thePKD1 duplicated region however deletions and missense changes wereidentified. In three families deletions of 3bp in exons 20 and 24 wereobserved which resulted in an aminoacid deletion without influencing thereading frame (7946del3 8047del3 and 9142 or 9143del3). A 14bp dele tion was observed in exon 16 (7177del14) and a 8bp deletion wasobserved in exon 21 (8183del8). The 7946del3 and 8183del8 mutationsoccurred on the same chromosome. Five missense mutations wereobserved (P2471L Q2519L T2649I H2921P V3375M) in exons 18 19 21 23 and 31 respectively. However we only have clear evidence thatH2921P is pathogenic. The other missense mutations occurred in singleADPKD families and were co segragating with the disease phenotype. Also 18 polymorphisms were observed either in exons or introns. Themajority of them did not affect the aminoacid sequence but six of themresulted in a substitution by biochemically similar aminoacids and theywere present in multiple families. Regarding the missense mutations andpolymorhisms the results should be interpreted with caution since nofunctional assay is yet available and small changes in aminoacid sequencemay or may not influence the structure of the protein thus affecting itsfunction. ,2001
1156,21 hydroxylase deficiency is a recessively inherited disorder resulting frommutations in the CYP21 gene which encodes an important enzyme in thesteroidogenesis pathway. The worldwide frequency is 1/14000 live births. CYP21 gene is located along with the CYP21P pseudogene in the HLAmajor histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6. The 98 % similarity oftwo genes and the fact that almost all frequently reported disease causingmutations reside in the pseudogene and are transferred to the active geneby gene conversion makes the molecular diagnosis difficult. Molecularanalysis based on allele spesific PCR using mutation site spesific primerswas performed in 30 Turkish patients and their families. The patients werescreened for the 8 most frequently reported mutations and the frequencieswere determined PRO30LEU (0 %) IVS2AS A/C G 13 (25.9 %) EXON3 Ã¢\x80\x94 8 bp DEL (3.7 %) ILE172ASN (9.2 %) EXON 6 Cluster (ILE237ASN VAL238GLU MET240LYS) (3.7 %) VAL281LEU (0 %) GLN318TER (9.2%) and ARG356TRP (11.1 %). Large scale deletions and 5 end conver sions were idenfied with Southern blot analysis using DIG labeled probes. The frequencies were found to be 9.2 % and 18.5 % respectively. In 9.5% of disease causing alleles none of these mutations were found. Thesequence analysis of the gene in these patients still continues. In 4 fami lies with known mutations prenatal diagnosis were performed upon fami lies requests. Additionally a semi quantitative PCR / enzyme digestion based approach for detection of large scale deletions/conversions of thegene was developed for routine diagnostic purposes and its accuracy wasshown by comparison with the results of Southern blot analysis. ,2001
1157,In 1995 the need for a comprehensive directory of genetic laboratories ata European level as well as a listing of the services they could offer led tothe establishment of the European Directory of DNA Laboratories(EDDNAL). An on line version of this directory (www.eddnal.com) hasbeen available on the net since January 1997. The on line directory isdesigned to promote information exchange between European centresand to improve awareness of the availability of services for rare geneticconditions. EDDNAL currently provides information for 317 laboratoriesand lists services for 580 genetic conditions. Through constant updating ofinformation EDDNAL endeavours to improve completeness of the registrythereby facilitating professional usage. Furthermore EDDNAL aims toimprove the quality of the services provided by professionals through thepromotion of laboratory participation in a quality assessment scheme. EDDNAL also intends to promote the diagnosis of very rare genetic dis eases with a consequent improvement in both the handling of such condi tions and in the genetic counselling provided. The development of theEDDNAL database and web site should result in an overall decrease in thetotal cost of DNA diagnoses of rare genetic disorders due to a Europeanconcerted approach based on the prevalence of such disorders. ,2001
1158, Introduction Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a hereditary metabolic disease and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the Nether lands relatives of genetically confirmed FH patients are screened bygenetic testing. Of these screenees the risk perception in terms of the per ceived probability of getting a heart attack later in life was studied. Westudied both the influence of test result and lapse in time on risk percep tion and the consequential influence of risk perception on cholesterol low ering medication use and stated attitude towards gene therapy. MethodsThe risk perception of 647 screenees was measured on 3 occasions (afterapproach 3 days and 7 months after the test result). Presentation of therisk was pre categorised and given both as numerical (1 in x) and verbalprobability. Medication use was asked 7 months and consideration of genetherapy 18 months after screening. Results Screen positives perceived ahigher risk than screen negatives except in verbal risk perception 7months after screening. Perceived risk was highest directly after approachand decreased over time. Both screen positives and negatives underesti mated the actual risk. Of the screen positives 68% would consider genetherapy. The higher the perceived risk the more likely a person was to beon cholesterol lowering therapy or to opt for gene therapy. Conclusion Thescreening programme raised the awareness of the screenees for their riskof cardiovascular disease and encouraged engagement in preventivebehaviours including medication use and gene therapy. ,2001
1159,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder with anewborn prevalence of 1 in 10 000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 40 60individuals. The SMA locus has been mapped to chromosome 5q11.2 13.The disease is caused by a deletion of the SMN gene often encompass ing other genes and microsatellite markers. The SMN gene is present intwo highly homologous copies SMN1 and SMN2 differing at fivenucleotide positions. Only homozygous SMN1 mutations cause the dis ease. The sequence similarity between the SMN1 and SMN2 genes canmake molecular diagnosis and carrier identification difficult. We developeda sensitive and reliable molecular test for SMN1 carrier identification bysetting up a non radioactive SSCP based method which allows for thequantification of the amount of the SMN1 gene product with respect to acontrol gene. The assay was validated in 56 obligate (ascertained) carriersand 20 (ascertained) non carriers. The sensitivity of the test is 96.4% andits specificity 95%. In addition six of seven SMA patients without homozy gous deletions presented with a heterozygous deletion suggesting a con comitant undetected point mutation on the non deleted SMN1 allele. Therefore the present test is effective for detecting compound/hemizygotepatients for testing carriers in SMA families and for screening for SMA het erozygotes in the general population.

1160,Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive diseasecaused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme Arylsulfatase A (ASA).Depending on whether the mutations in the ASA gene cause complete oronly partial loss of enzyme activity age of onset and the course of the dis ease vary. MLD is lethal and no specific treatment can be offered topatients. Genetic counseling and the offer of prenatal diagnosis are there fore a need. They are complicated by the great variety of different muta tions occuring in the ASA gene. The aim of this study is to identify diseasecausing ASA mutations and to study their nature and distribution in ourpatient population. Mutation screening was started in a group of 50 MLDpatients. Fifty healthy individuals serve as controls. Preliminary results apartial screening of the ASA gene using SSCP and sequencing lead to theidentification of 24 mutant alleles carrying 20 different mutations 9 ofwhich were novel. 85% of mutations found were nucleotide substitutions(missense/nonsense) 10% splice site mutations and 5% small deletions. This corresponds well to the distribution found among known ASA muta tions. An unexpected result was that 13 of 29 patients tested so far werefound to be heterozygous for the so called pseudodeficiency allele UponPosters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policy 307completion of the mutation screening the question will be answered whether the high pd allele frequency in our patients is due to an associa tion of this allele with a specific ASA mutation. Our method efficientlydetects known as well as unknown mutations and thus represents a use ful tool for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of MLD. ,2001
1161,This study report a genetic investigation in 110 institutionalized individualswith severe mental retardation (MR) ranging from 1 to 68 years of age(median 27 64 sex ratio 1.2F 1M) using clinical examination convention al cytogenetic molecular methodologies for FRAXA FRAXE and 15q11.2 q12 methylation pattern and also screening for inborn errors of the metab olism. We excluded 25 individuals (22 7%) with an acquired cause of MRand in the remaining 85 subjects 8 2% had a chromosomal abnormality[four trisomy 21 including two mosaics two mos45 X/46 XX including a68 year old woman and one case of del(3)(q24~25)]. One atypical case ofAngelman syndrome was diagnosed however no FRAXA and FRAXEamplification were found. Among the metabolic disorder 20% of all individ uals had an increased rate of aminoacids in urine. No cases of homo cystinuria phenylketonuria or methylmalonicaciduria were detected. Clas sical genetic syndromes were present including one neural tube defect spectrum two true microcephalic syndrome one Norrie syndrome onePelizaeus Merzbacher syndrome one panhypopituitarism dwarfism andone possible velo cardio facial syndrome. Two cases had similarly affect ed sibs and in eight cases a familial history of MR was reported. Few rarersyndromes such as W syndrome and a syndrome associated to cutis gira tum were also clinically diagnosed. In 42% of cases no etiological classifi cation was possible. Our results points to the great heterogeneity of the eti ology in MR such as previous reports and justify the application of otherrefined research methodologies in the screening of genetic causes. Themean age of the population investigated mostly adults may impose someobstacles to establish a clinical diagnosis in the other hand it may illus trate the natural clinical history of rare genetic diseases associated tosevere MR.

1162,Cystic fibrosis is a human genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. Mutations in the gene encodingthis protein disrupt electrolyte secretion leading to hyperosmolar viscousmucus. The Hungarian Cystic Fibrosis Database Project was started in1998. We established a unified score system for all the Hungarian CFpatients including their clinical status and their genetic background too. The Hungarian CF Registry contained 345 patients in 1998. Using thesedata allows us to perform comprehensive scientific analysis of CF patientsdistribution in Hungary their current age manifestation gender ratio pul monary and gastrointestinal performance status genotype vs. phenotypecorrelation Kaplan Ã¢\x80\x94 Meier analysis. The systematic mutation analysis for deltaF508 mutation was started in 1990 in our laboratory. In the first year80 patients had been screened. Out of them 42 patients proved to behomozygous and 11 heterozygous for this mutation. In order to determinemutations in the CFTR gene 1826 Hungarian persons have been tested. We isolated DNA from whole blood followed PCR amplification restrictionenzyme digestion and fragment analysis. From 1992 we extended ourcapacity up to the most common five European mutations (deltaF508 G542X G551D R553X and N1303K) and occasionally (since 1998) weidentify further 26 mutations too. In 152 cases (34%) deltaF508 were pre sented in homozygous and in 116 cases (26%) in heterozygous forms. Detection rate was 4 5% for mutation G524X 2% for R553X and 2 2% forN1303K mutation. Mutation G551D was not present in our cases. In 54cases prenatal diagnosis was successfully done. Thirteen samples DNAcarried the disease mutations. Intragenic microsatellite analysis for indirectstudy of CFTR gene has been performed since 1989 too. In Hungary atthe present all suspected CF patients get the possibilities of mutationanalysis indicated by specialists and appropriate criteria. ,2001
1163,Hemochromatosis the most common known genetic disorder among Cau casians is an autosomal recessive condition associated with excessiveabsorption of iron which may result in liver cirrhosis heart failure diabetes impotence and arthritis and cause early death. Considering the relativelarge number of people affected (about 0.5%) of the population the poten tial severity of the disease and the relative ease of prevention and treat ment of the disease population screening for hemochromatosis has beenadvocated. However genetic screening possible since the discovery ofthe HFE gene is controversial. The relationship between genotype (pres ence of mutants of the HFE gene) iron overload and clinical hemochro matosis is complex and not fully understood and the possibility remainsthat a large proportion of asymptomatic homozygotes may never developiron overload. Possible negative consequences for the individual includeincreased anxiety and possible discrimination in obtaining insurance oremployment. There are also implications for the family who have a highrisk of having the affected gene and may or may not want to know. In addi tion the social costs such as stigmatization as well as the resource costsassociated with limited health care resources will be considered. Thispaper will review key ethical and social consequences for both homozy gotes (high risk for the disease) and heterozygotes (carriers) by examiningthe professional debate by comparing guidelines and policies from differ ent countries and by evaluating lessons learned from screening programsfor Cystic Fibrosis(CF) Sickle Cell or Tay Sachs diseases.

1164, In many parts of the world including Hong Kong and South China whereG6PD deficiency is prevalent and with the wide spread use of some drugse.g. Chinese herbal medicine G6PD deficiency is a health problem. InHong Kong new borns in government hospitals are screened by theenzyme assay. The at risk identified are counselled to avoid the offendingagents thus alleviating much of the clinical consequences. Since G6PD isX linked it is often difficult to classify the genotypes particularly the het erozygous females based on enzyme activity measurements alone. Wehave used two DNA based mutation detection methods the denaturinggradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and single stranded conformationpolymorphism (SSCP) to evaluate the validity of the enzyme activity cut off of 9.0 IU/gHb currently adopted to distinguish the heterozygotes fromthe normal females. From the results of 195 female samples with G6PDactivity 1 IU above the cut off about 7% of G6PD deficient heterozygoteswere missed. For an enzyme activity of 9.0 to10.4 IU/gHb about 9%female heterozygotes had been identified by the DNA based detection inthese samples. The frequency of each of the common Chinese mutationsfrom samples with enzyme activity 9.0 to 12.4 IU/gHb correlates well withthe frequency of each of these mutations found in the local population. Theimplications of these findings and the use of enzyme assay alone forscreening will be discussed. ,2001
1165,In the developing countries where more than 80% of the world s popula tion lives and the majority of children will be born there are importantobstacles for the progress in clinical and medical genetics. Among medicalprofessionals and public health officials issues as poverty illiteracy highinfant mortality and other urgent matters concerning basic health care usu ally have precedence over genetic diseases and birth defects. However the general prevalence of these conditions seems higher than in devel oped nations and the limited resources enhance the burden on individuals families and populations. In addition the requirement for genetic servicesis increasing as a consequence of the advances in medical genetics andthis reinforces the need for programs in management and prevention espe cially at a primary health care level. Brazil has a total population estimatedaround 167 millions inhabitants with a wide range of regional inequalities. Total infant mortality rate e.g. is 37.5 per 1000 but it ranges from 60.4 inthe less developed Northeast region to 25.8 in the more industrialisedregion of Southeast while the poverty rate is 52.9% in the former and 16%in the latter. These contrasts are reflected in the implementation of genet ic services the majority located in urban centres as tertiary care universi ty hospitals in the South and Southeast regions with an emphasis still ondysmorphology routine cytogenetics and counselling. There are few bio chemical laboratories and DNA based diagnosis is rising particularly withresearch purposes. A current overview concerning these issues will be pre sented. Strategies including governmental and community participation improvement of epidemiological data development of rational and ethicalgenetic health programs are among the proposals for providing appropri ate genetic services for the Brazilian population. ,2001
1166,Based on decades of partnering with lay advocacy groups involved inresearch the Genetic Alliance defines research as a shared enterprise collaboration between participants and researchers. The cultures of scien tific investigators and lay advocacy often differ resulting in dynamic andcreative tensions between shared and divergent interests. Lay advocacygroups are empowered to assume their role as equal partners in research. Lay advocacy groups represent research participants interests Ã¢\x80\x94 both those directly involved in the study and those who stand to be impacted bystudy results. They are able to initiate research with a clear focus andmake decisions about research that will prove most effective for the condi tion. Lay advocacy groups are optimally positioned to collect epidemiolog ical and phenotypic data. By living in a virtual community which promotesthe sharing of stories they have their hands on essential information thatis usually inaccessible to clinicians or researchers who employ more tradi tional participant and tissue solicitation methods. A number of models willbe presented. In addition as proteomics takes center stage research willrequire collaborations in well developed networks of researchers partici pants and their respective organizations. These partnerships will be boththe catalyst and fuel for acceleration of research that is essential toadvancing new understandings. In the past academia and industry haveoften worked on parallel tracks apart from the lay advocacy and publicsectors. Increasing numbers of research collaborations give rise to effec tive and efficient interactive models that can sustain the essentialresources for genetics research. ,2001
1167,Lack of data about manifestations natural history and epidemiology of raregenetic disorders inhibit research. Often difficulty identifying affected indi viduals limits the funding possibilities and makes the acquisition of patientsamples and data difficult. Further the agenda of researchers and partici pants can diverge in ways that ultimately delay progress. Pseudoxanthomaelasticum (PXE) is a rare genetic disorder. PXE International a lay advo cacy organization founded in 1995 initiates supports and funds research. It also provides support for affected individuals their families and theirhealthcare providers. Establishment of various programs in 21 countriesworld wide is critical to providing genetic services and supporting research. Empowering the individuals in numerous countries and cultures requiresan investment of resources in these communities. As a result the PXEInternational Blood and Tissue Bank has branches in Italy and SouthAfrica. The results of efforts made by PXE International are the PXE Inter national Research Consortium comprised of15 laboratories world wide amultidisciplinary approach forging collaborations amongst many special ists a focused agenda which accelerates research in the service of con sumer interests and increased congressional awareness for real out comes of medical research funding. The organization is also uniquely ableto safeguard confidentiality by acting as a firewall between researchersand participants. Genetic lay advocacy using this model can benefit fromthe added advantage of international collaboration furthering geneticresearch for rare disorders. ,2001
1168,Health Technology Assessment (HTA) provides legitimacy to health servic es planning. Given the drive towards evidence based medicine and policy the introduction of new technologies is closely scrutinised and expected toproduce measurable benefits. In genetics the technology transfer fromresearch to clinical services has not traditionally been supported by a for mal evaluation process (in contrast to therapeutics or medical devices).The Qu bec Agency for Health Services and Technology Assessment eval uated the relevance of implementing several molecular tests into clinicalservices and assessed the corresponding diagnostic/screening strategies. The purpose of this communication is to discuss the evaluative approachused as well as the challenges and potential contribution of HTA. Ourexperience shows that the usual criteria for assessing diagnostic/screen ing tests do not constitute a satisfactory framework for molecular tests. Evaluating test validity is complicated by the constant evolution of tech niques the frequent absence of standardisation and the need to distin guish between clinical and analytical validity. The utility ofdiagnostic/screening strategies may be difficult to measure because of thepsycho social and collective nature of benefits and risks and is often poor ly documented. Besides the scientific literature HTA needs to consider theregional and organisational context which affects the utility feasibility andPosters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policy 309acceptability of alternative strategies. HTA provides legitimacy to the deci sion making process by formulating recommendations that take intoaccount the available data and their limits. Another contribution of HTA isto define the conditions required to ensure the provision of appropriate andco ordinated services which are relevant to planning and policy making.

1169,The gene expression profiling service of the Resource Center (RZPD) isopen for all groups working on functional genomics of human mouse andrat. We isolate poly A+ RNA synthe size P33 labeled cDNA and hybridizeit with the RZPD Unigene filter sets of human (set I about 33.800 gene andEST clones set II about 76.000 clones) mouse (about 25.000 clones) orrat (about 26.000 clones). Phosphorimaging and evaluation of the data bydifferent soft ware tools make it possible to find out with genes are over orunderexpressed for example in a certain tissue in comparison to a controlsample. In the moment a public database is set up to make the data avail able for all people working with our filters or other microarrays. In the workshown here we address the question why renal failure in rats causes car diac dis eases. Cardiovascular complications in patients with renal failureare an extremely important clinical problem. The characterisitc changes ofcardiovascular disease in renal failure can be nicely reproduced in theexperimental model of the subtotally nephrectomized rat (SNX). In order toidentify genes which are differentially regulated during the course of the disease the gene expression profiles of hearts of sham operated rats (con trols) and SNX with renal failure of 12 weeks duration where compared. The hybridizations were repeated several times and also performed withdifferent Unigene sets (rat mouse human ) under stringent condi tions. We were able to confirm results of previous experiments showing an acti vation of car diac interstitial cells in SNX rats for example by specificgrowth factors. The behavior of a number of other genes could help us toexplain certain cardiovascular changes in uremic rats. Due to the homolo gy of many rat cDNAs to human and/or mouse genes it was possible tointerpret the results from the different filter sets by computer analysis. Inaddition we could clearly document that we are able to produce reliabledata with our experiments. ,2001
1170,Lesch Nyhan syndrome is an X linked recessive disorder involving thepurine metabolism with resultant hyperuricemia choreoathetosis self mutilation and profound neurologic dysfunction. A deficiency of theenzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase is responsiblefor the disease. The human HPRT gene is located at Xq26 27 and consistsof nine exons spanning approximately 45 Kb. We have recruited twelveItalian unrelated Lesch Nyhan patients diagnosed with LN syndromeaccording to the clinical and laboratory findings. Studies by PCR and directsequencing on genomic DNA from patients revealed two missense muta tions two nonsense mutation two mutations in the splicing acceptor sites three large deletions leading to a loss of more exons two insertion of onebase and one compound mutation consisting in a four base deletion witha three base insertion. Five of these twelve mutations have not been pre viously described 74C>G (Pro25Arg) in exon 2 329 332delCAAC insTCTin exon 4 506insC in exon 7 IVS6 1G>A in the acceptor site of intron 6 and IVS7 1G>C in the acceptor site of intron 7. Four mutations have beenpreviously described in unrelated families and three mutations have beenalready published. Characterization of the HPRT mutations allowed us todetect the carrier status in eight females from seven families. In one fami ly the mutation was de novo. Identification of mutations provides a valuabletool for confirmation of the diagnosis for identification of relatives whomight be potential carriers for pleimplantation testing and for prenataldiagnosis. ,2001
1171,Complete dystrophin mRNA sequence has been analyzed in 36 Duchennemuscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)patients. Deletions and duplications in mRNA were detected using reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction and point mutations were foundusing the protein truncation test. Individual mutations were characterizedby sequence analysis and their correlation with diagnosis of DMD or BMDwas checked. One patient with BMD phenotype was associated with non sense mutation E1110X. In the case of the E1110X mutation an alternativesplicing of dystrophin mRNA (3486 3640del) was detected in this patient which included the E1110X mutation site (nucleotide 3536) and did notchange the translation reading frame. Expression of the major dystrophinmRNA isoform (from the muscle brain and Purkinje promotors) has beenanalyzed in 15 patients with suspicion on X linked dilated cardiomyopathy(XLDC). Analysis of the expression of three dystrophin mRNA isoform wascomplemented by DNA analysis of the muscle promotor the first exon andfirst exon intron boundary.

1172,Recently neonatal hypertrypsinaemia has been associated to the presenceof increased frequency of rare CFTR mutations and IVS8 5T polymor phism. In the period October 1998 October 2000 neonatal screening pro gram performed in out laboratory on the population of Lombardia region identified 25 hypertrypsinaemic infants presenting borderline sweat test(chloride value between 30 and 60mmol/L). The aim of our study was toassess the incidence of rare CFTR mutations or polymorphisms in infantswith neonatal hypertrypsinaemia and with a borderline sweat test in thefirst months of life. Among the 25 hypertrypsinaemic infants 22 were het erozygous for one CFTR mutation identified within the neonatal screeningprogram (IRT/IRT+DNA by PCR/OLA assay for up to 31 mutations). Anextended analysis of CFTR gene was performed on the 25 hypertrypsi naemic infants using DGGE technique on 11 out 27 exons sequencinganalysis of splice site polymorphism in intron 8 (TG)mTn and sequencinganalysis of DNAs that showed an abnormal DGGE electrophoretic pattern.310 Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public PolicyThe results identified a total of 17 different CFTR alleles eight F508del four R117H two G542X two N1303K two D1152H R347P 2183AA >G 621+1G >A 2789+5G >A R553X R347H R117L V1153E Y1032C 711+3G >A. In addition we identified a novel mutation D110E (2 cases).Furthermore IVS8 (TG)mTn polymorphisms were tested and the haplo type TG12T5 was identified in seven infants. In total we identified 14 com pound heterozygotes (seven with two CFTR mutations seven with onemutation/TG12T5) 10 subjects with only one mutation identified whereasin only one patient no gene alterations were found. In conclusion we sug gest that a high frequency of CFTR gene mutations is present amonghypertrypsinaemic neonates presenting a borderline sweat test in the firstmonths of life. Moreover we suggests that some immunoreactive trypsinpositive neonates are actually affected by a very mild form of CF anextended genetic analysis is recommended and furthermore clinical followup in specialised Centres is needed to diagnose mild or atypical forms ofCF.

1173,Objective Mutations in the gene for low density lipoprotein receptor(LDLR) has been associated with increased total and LDL cholesterol lev els leading to accelerated atherosclerosis. The aim of our study was todefine sequence variations causing familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)phenotype in Czech patients. Methods 625 patients with high total andLDL cholesterol normal serum triglyceride and with family history of pre mature CHD were selected for study. Screening of the mutant exons ofLDLR gene was performed using heteroduplex analysis SSCP DGGE DNA sequencing and PCR/RFLP analysis. Results Molecular searchingfor mutations in coding sequence of above mentioned gene resulted in theidentification of 29 probably pathogenic sequence variations and 8 silentmutations many of which are new and were not described previously. Con clusion Knowledge of mutations causing autosomal dominant lipoprotein disorder FH is an aid for unambiguous diagnosis facilitates genetic con sulting at early age together with preventing disease manifestation.

1174,Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease ofhigh prevalence around the Mediterranean countries with four ethnicgroups being particularly affected namely Non Ashkenazi Jews Armeni ans Arabs and Turks. Typically it presents as acute episodes of periodicfever accompanied by complaints of abdominal pain chest pain or jointpain. The actual attack usually lasts from 12 to 72 hours with arthralgia orarthritis often lasting longer. The most dangerous potential complication ofFMF is amyloidosis than can lead to end stage renal failure. Atypical phe notypic presentation makes diagnosis difficult and in many occasionsdiagnosis is established by exclusion. The administration of Colchicineconstitutes an effective treatment. The responsible gene MEFV is placedon chromosome 16p13.3 and it encodes a 781 aminoacid protein Pyrin/Marenostrin. About 20 mutations have been identified so far some of thembeing very frequent accounting for a high percentage of patients. Foundereffects have been postulated to be responsible for the high frequency ofcertain mutations in selected populations rather than recurrence. Molecu lar epidemiological investigation of the Greek Cypriot population revealsthat about 1/25 is a carrier of one of three mutations V726 A being themost frequent. Among 44 MEFV chromosomes analysed the results are V726A 36.4% F479L 20.4% M694V 18.2% E148Q 4.5 % M680I 2.3 % Unknown 18.2%. Mutation F479L is rather rare in other populations. Theseresults suggest that contrary to previous believes FMF is not a rare condi tion in Cyprus and molecular testing is expected to assist further in identi fying ambiguous cases. ,2001
1175,Molecular Genetics testing forms an increasingly important part of thediagnostic process in all branches of medicine. Studies of the reliability ofsuch testing have indicated a significant level of inaccuracy in laboratoryreports arising from errors in sample identification genotyping or interpre tation. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) aims toraise and maintain the quality of Diagnostic Clinical Molecular GeneticsTesting. One way of doing this is to provide standard external qualityassessment (EQA) schemes to allow diagnostic laboratories to test andimprove their proficiency. Since its inception in 1997 EMQN has providedfifteen EQA schemes in six disease specific areas. Separate postersdescribing each disease specific scheme can be found alongside thisposter. EQA schemes are designed to test the ability of laboratories tointerpret data in the light of clinical information supplied with a referral andto produce a clear and accurate report. Laboratories from all EU countriesand several others have participated in EMQN EQA exercises. In 2000 theschemes evaluated 207 returns from laboratories a 65% increase on1999. The standards of accuracy were high but significant error rates werefound and methods of reporting and interpreting data were varied. Theerror rate indicates a clear need for EQA to measure current standards ofproficiency and encourage laboratories to raise their technical perform ance. Differences in interpretation of data and reporting standards can beaddressed by bringing centres together to discuss a consensus and agreeguidelines for best practice in diagnostic clinical molecular genetics.

1176, wuerzburg.deBreast and ovarian cancers (Br/Ov) are the most frequent cancers inwomen with a life time risk of about 10 % in Western countries. About 5 %of all cases are thought to be familial due to mutations in the BRCA1 andBRCA2 genes. Given the prevalence of Br/Ov cancers mutation screen ing of the BRCA genes is now being offered to at risk women. The mainbenefit of mutation detection is the predictive testing of relatives of identi fied mutation carriers. In 1999 a pilot External Quality Assessment (EQA)scheme was offered by the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network(EMQN) for the genetic testing of the BRCA1 gene. Following the suc cessful trial the scope of the scheme was widened in 2000 to include acase of a predictive test for a known family mutation and testing for theBRCA2 gene. The scheme was offered to a wider audience with 24 labo ratories from 14 countries participating. Error rates were calculated fromthe total number of alleles analysed by all laboratories. On this basis theoverall error rate (% of incorrect alleles) was 2 9 % (1.25% in 1999). Mosterrors were the result of failure to identify a given mutation. Variation in theinterpretation and reporting was noted. Reasons for the increased errorrate and variation in interpretation and reporting will be given in contextwith other EMQN disease specific EQA schemes. The results emphasisethe need for additional efforts in raising standards through the provision ofEQA schemes and best practice guidelines. ,2001
1177,Huntington Disease (HD) a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disorder is the most common CAG repeat disease with an incidence of 1 in 10 000people in Europe. HD is caused by an expansion of a highly polymorphicCAG repeat in exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene. Genetic testing for thisexpansion is routinely offered in diagnostic molecular genetics laborato ries. In 1997 the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN)organised a pilot External Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme for genetictesting of the HD gene with 14 participants from 13 different EuropeanUnion countries. The HD scheme is now the longest running EMQNscheme with 39 participants (18 countries) in 2000. As the number of par ticipants has increased there has been a consequent rise in the error rate(% of incorrect alleles) to 2.6% (2000) from 1.3% (1997). The error rateswere calculated from the number of alleles analysed by all laboratories. Incontrast the precision of genotyping has increased with 74% (2000) of allalleles typed within the error limits (+/ 1 repeat unit for alleles up to 40repeats and +/ 4 repeats for alleles >40). Reporting styles varied but inter pretation was more consistent with the majority of laboratories coveringmost of the interpretative criteria adequately. The results emphasise theimportance of EQA schemes in measuring and raising the standards ofdiagnostic genetic testing. ,2001
1178,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common muscle wast ing disease in children with an incidence of 1 in 4 000 males. A milder vari ant of the disease Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) is less common withan incidence of 1 in 18 000 males. Both diseases are due to mutations inthe Dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. Genetic testing for DMD andBMD by mutation screening of the dystrophin gene is routinely offered indiagnostic molecular genetics laboratories. The main benefit of this testingis carrier detection in relatives of affected individuals. In 1998 a pilot Exter nal Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme for DMD and BMD was offered bythe European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) 15 laborato ries participated. Following the successful trial the scheme was offered toa wider audience and the number of participating laboratories hasincreased to 33 (16 countries) in 2000. Error rates from the scheme werecalculated from the total number of alleles analysed by all labs. The over all error rate (% incorrect alleles) for the 2000 scheme was 2.02% (4.44% 1998 0.98% 1999). The structure of the scheme has evolved in line withproblems identified in each round of EQA. In 1998 3 deletion cases wereprovided. In 1999 a pedigree was included and participants asked to per form linkage analysis. In light of problems identified with the interpretationof linkage analysis a linkage question was also included in the 2000scheme. The scheme will be described in full and the results for both geno typing and interpretation will be discussed and lessons drawn from thedevelopment of the scheme. ,2001
1179,Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative dis order is the most common hereditary ataxia with an estimated prevalenceof 1 in 50 000. The most frequent genetic abnormality seen in FRDA is thehomozygous expansion of a GAA repeat in the FRDA gene. The genetictest for FRDA is particularly useful because different forms of ataxia maybe difficult or impossible to distinguish by clinical examination alone. In1998 the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) organ ised a pilot External Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme for genetic testingof the FRDA gene with 10 participants from 10 different European Unioncountries. No sample identification or genotyping errors were recorded buta small number of errors or omissions of interpretation were identified. Accordingly a best practice workshop was organised to develop best prac tice guidelines for FRDA testing. These guidelines are available on theEMQN web site (www.emqn.org). Following the successful pilot a secondscheme was offered in 2000. 34 laboratories including 3 from the USA par ticipated. Results will be reported and any required amendments to theguidelines identified by this process. ,2001
1180, erlangen.deCharcot Marie Tooth disease type 1 (CMT1) is a clinically and geneticallyheterogeneous disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Patients showseverely reduced nerve conduction velocities (NCV<38 m/s). CMT type 1Ais the most frequent autosomal dominantly inherited form caused by a 1.5 Mb tandem duplication in chromosome 17p11.2 12 comprising the periph eral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Genetic testing for CMT1A is rou tinely offered in diagnostic molecular genetics laboratories and performedusing a wide variety of methods. The main benefit for patients is avoidanceof a sural nerve biopsy for diagnostic purposes. In 1999 a pilot ExternalQuality Assessment (EQA) scheme for CMT was offered by the EuropeanMolecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN). From 14 registered labora tories a total of 11 participated. Following this successful trial the schemewas offered to a wider audience in 2000 with 20 laboratories participating(23 registered). No genotyping errors were detected in either scheme. Thescheme will be described in full and the results for both genotyping andinterpretation will be discussed. Lessons drawn from the development ofthe scheme should help in harmonising laboratory standards for the genet ic diagnosis of CMT. ,2001
1181, heidelberg.deThe PCR screening of microdeletions of the Y chromosome has becomean important diagnostic step in the workup of male infertility. However there is still uncertainty about how this diagnosis should be performed. There are suggestions that the large variation in deletion frequency report ed in the literature (varying between 1 and 55%) could be due to the vari ous selection criteria of the patients analysed but methodological aspectscould also play a role. Like other genetic diseases the overall quality ofmolecular diagnosis of Y chromosomal microdeletions should be controlledby adopting strict internal quality control measures and by participating inexternal quality assessment (EQA) schemes. Such an external qualityassessment project was started on the initiative of the European Academyof Andrology (EAA). Three preliminary trials involving 29 European labora tories have given a state of the art picture of the overall diagnostic per formance showing an overall rate of misdiagnosis of about 5% for both theAZFb and AZFc regions. In collaboration with the European MolecularGenetics Quality Network (EMQN) the data from the preliminary trials wereused to generate the first guidelines for molecular diagnosis of Y chromo somal microdeletions and were presented at a best practice workshop heldin the spring of 2000. An official EQA programme for Y chromosomalmicrodeletions was then initiated as a joint initiative of the EAA and theEMQN. The first EAA/EMQN trial EQA scheme started in October 2000and includes 57 participants from 20 countries. The results will be pre sented. ,2001
1182,The world distribution of beta and alpha thalassemias is well documentedbut adequate data on gene frequency defects are available only for a smallnumber of populations. Beta disease is common throughout the Mediter ranean regions Middle East India Southern Asia starting in SouthernChina stretching through Thailand Cambodia Laos and Malaysia penin sula. Alpha disease is extremely common in part of Africa Mediterraneanregion Middle East Southern Asia and Pacific islands. Multiethnic Italianreality in the last five years required new molecular approach to cover dif ferent mutation patterns and to achieve full DNA information in couples atrisk. In 1997 foreign people with regular permit were more than 2.000.000but the number does not include children and clandestines (the last morethan 1.000.000). Moreover in comparison with France and Germanywhere immigration is homogeneous the phenomenon in Italy is character ized by a great heterogeneity infact a part of immigration in Italy during thelast years arrived from North Africa Senegal Albania ex Yugoslavia Romania Poland Bulgaria Philippines and China. In North Italy actuallylives more than 5% of immigrants many of them are at risk for tha lassemias or hereditary haemoglobinopathies such as Hb S and a greatincrease of this phenomenon is expected in the near future. Screening pro grams for prevention of these diseases and prenatal diagnosis have deter mined in a marked reduction in the birth rate of affected children. The prac tical problems associated with genetic screening of beta thalassemia arenow a minor problem thanks to the new molecular technologies and on theother hand alpha thalassemia gene defects are partially but more easilydetectable by PCR protocols. In our 15 years activity we performed 1765DNA prenatal diagnoses of Thalassemias and hereditary Haemoglo binopathies. Since 1995 foreign people began to ask counseling forhaemoglobin disorders to our Centre (estimate frequency = 6%). The geo graphic origin is the following Africa (3 2%) Asia (0.7%) East Europe(1.3%) Middle East (0.3%) and South America (0.5%). Since the phenom enon is increasing in relation to the establishment of permanent familygroups we need to adapt the screening program to the new ethnic Italiandistribution and we look forward to organize a more appropiate geneticcounselling that include Easy and wide educational programs on the terri tory. Easy and multiethnic PCR protocols to achieve molecular informationin couple at risk for different thalassemia syndromes.

1183,Rett Syndrome is an X linked dominant neurodevelopmental disordercharacterized by several clinical abnormalities such as progressiveencephalopathy autistic behavior and stereotyped hand movements. Clas sical RS features seem to occur almost exclusively in females with an esti mated prevalence of one in 10 000 15 000 female birth. The vast majori ties of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin and are due to de novomutations. Mutations in the Methyl CpG Binding protein 2 gene have been identified in roughly 75 % of classical Rett girls. We collected DNA samplesfrom 42 Italian classical Rett girls and screened the MECP2 coding regionfor mutations by Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography(DHPLC) and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently devel oped method for mutation screening combining high sensitivity reducedcost per run and high throughput. In our study 16 different de novoMECP2 mutations seven of which were previously unreported were foundin 32/42 Rett girls (76%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized ina total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identifi cation of 14/16 different mutations (87%) after optimal conditions wereestablished this figure increased to 100% with all recurrent MECP2 muta tions generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Standardizationof DHPLC reagents and methods seems to be critical to the reliability andaccuracy of mutation prediction. Detailed analysis of signature shape retention time and retention time differences between peaks will allow sig nature based sequence identification at least for the most commonMECP2 mutations and SNPs. ,2001
1184,There is consensus that microsatellites evolve by stepwise mutations andthat the mutation rate is positively correlated with repeat size. However there is disagreement about the influence on the mutation rate of the sizeand nature of the repeat motif GC content of flanking regions influence ofheterozigosity and direction biases. Molecular studies of germinative muta tions are needed to elucidate their mechanisms Here we present mutationdata on ten new human microsatellite loci that have been chosen becausethey have average heterozigosity > 0.6 different amplicon sizes that per mit multiplexing (all ten loci can be amplified in a single PCR reaction andanalyzed in the same electrophoretic run using a single fluorophore). Weanalyzed 27 086 parent/child allelic transfers selected from paternitycases. We observed 26 instances of father child mismatches in caseswhere fatherhood had been otherwise proven. Cases due to null alleleswere verified and removed from the study group. The average mutationrate was 10 3 per locus per meiosis but there was considerable hetero geneity according to sex and locus. The average paternal mutation ratewas 1.3 X 10 3 and the average maternal mutation rate was 0.4 X 10 3.No mutations were observed in three loci while ten different mutationswere seen in one single locus (D10S1237). All mutations were sequenced. The vast majority (92%) were single step mutations. In general our resultsare concordant with previous family studies of microsatellite studies inhumans and increase considerably the database of well studied humanmutational events on which to test mechanistic hypotheses. ,2001
1185,"X linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM OMIM# 310400) is a severe con genital muscle disease caused by mutations in the myotubularin gene. This gene encodes for a dual specific phosphatase belonging to a largegene family highly conserved through evolution. To date 133 mutationsdistributed in all exons of the MTM1 gene have been identified in a largenumber of families. Since the majority of MTM1 mutations are private andrare their detection is difficult and labor extensive using traditional screen ing approaches. We set up and formatted a denaturing high performanceliquid chromatography (DHPLC) method to detect MTM1 mutations in allcoding exons of the gene. Our protocol has revealed the pathogenic muta tion in 8 XLMTM patients screened for the entire coding sequence of thegene. DHPLC identified 7 point mutations previously described [R37X T(191 11)A 646 647insA T197I R253X G378R G402R]. In addition weidentified two novel mutations one in exon 8 [P199S] and one in the donorsplice site of exon 14 (1644+2)insG. In conclusion we provided thatDHPLC analysis is a sensitive and specific method to detect mutations inMTM1 gene. Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policy 313P1089.

De PaepeCenter Medical Genetics University Hospital Gent BelgiumLudwine. M', 'Although NF1 is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorderswith 50% of patients presenting as de novo cases efficient and sensitivemutation analysis of the NF1 gene is still not available for clinical use. Wedeveloped a combined approach starting from short term cultured T lym phocytes leading to detection of NF1 mutations in 95% of typical NF1patients fulfilling the N. I.H. diagnostic criteria. The cascade of analysesincludes 1) protein truncation test (PTT) followed by cDNA and gDNAsequencing of the region of interest 2) intragenic microsatellite analysisfollowed by FISH to detect total gene deletions and/or by sequencing of thecomplete cDNA to detect missense mutations 3) Southern blot and cyto genetic analysis. So far 112 bona fide mutations were identified in 121unrelated patients. For 9 patients steps 2 and 3 of the cascade are stillongoing. All mutations were characterized at the genomic and RNA level. Using the PTT only the mutation was identified in 100 patients and themutational spectrum consisted of 26 frameshift 40 nonsense and 34 splic ing mutations 25 of the latter caused by alterations outside the canonicalAG/GT splice sites. Furthermore 8 missense or small in frame deletions 3 total gene deletions and 1 translocation t(14 17)(q32 q11.2) were foundby steps 2 and 3 of the cascade. Our approach may be helpful in estab lishing the diagnosis of sporadic patients at an early age or not totally ful filling the N. I.H. diagnostic criteria and in providing the means to prenatalor preimplantation diagnosis especially in sporadic patients. ",2001
1186,Familial cylindromatosis (Brooke Spiegler syndrome) (OMIM numbers123850 313100) is a rare skin disorder inherited in an autosomal domi nant fashion and usually presenting in the second or third decade of life. With female preponderance dermal tumors predominantly arise in hairyareas of the body with approximately 90% on the head and neck rarely onthe face or trunk. Transformation to malignancy seems to be rare. Recent ly the susceptibility gene CYLD which reveals the genetic attributes of atumor suppressor gene (recessive oncogene) has been localized to chro mosome 16q and mutations have been identified in affected families. Here we studied the molecular basis of familial cylindromatosis in a multigener ation family of German origin. Using PCR microsatellite analysis het eroduplex analysis and automated sequencing we identified a frameshiftmutation in the CYLD gene in several individuals. Mutation analysis furtherallowed exclusion of the tumor predisposition in a 6 year old boy. Interest ingly in several family members with identical genotype we observed a dis tinct phenotype. While some individuals revealed discrete small skin col ored tumors localized in the nasolabial region one family member showedexpansion of multiple big tumors on the trunk and in a turban like fashionon the head. The reasons for different clinical expression patterns of thesame genetic defect in this disease remain elusive. Identification of theCYLD gene and modern genetic techniques enable us to rapidly confirmputative diagnoses on the genetic level to give a prognosis for familymembers at risk for developing multiple tumors and to offer genetic coun seling for affected families. ,2001

1188,Global decline in infant mortality and birth rate especially in developingnations is shifting the focus of health policy from acute conditions of envi ronmental origin towards the management of chronic diseases and dis ability. This change is notable in the areas of reproductive and child health. An increasing proportion of infants born with congenital disabilities are nowbeing diagnosed surviving and thus constituting an increasing health bur den. This health burden could be greatly reduced by deploying approach es outlined in the 1985 WHO definition of a control programme for a con genital disorder. These approaches also offer people with genetic disad vantage choices that enable them to live and reproduce as normally aspossible in their circumstances. However no comprehensive model ofthese interventions is available. Consequent on a previous WHO EasternMediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) initiative a WHO Advisory Groupwas convened in Cairo in December 1999 to make recommendations on Public Health Approaches for the Control of Genetically Determined Dis orders and Birth Defects in Primary Health Care . The global epidemiologyand health burden of congenital disorders was reviewed. It was recognizedthat medical management of these conditions entailed costs that escalat ed exponentially as patient survival increased and this required to be coun terbalanced by effective prevention programmes. These included basic pri mary health care reproductive health approaches including accessiblefamily planning adequate diets and micronutrient supplementation pre vention and management of maternal infections and avoidance of terato gens. Implementation of such programmes can reduce the birth preva lence of congenital disorders to a baseline level with further reduction thendepending on population screening programmes to identify individuals atincreased risk of having children with specific disorders. As no standard setof interventions is universally applicable the Advisory Group developed apackage of recommendations that a country could contemplate imple menting according to its needs and circumstances. It further proposed thatcountries could form a national task force to develop a national plan utiliz ing baseline epidemiological data. A draft protocol and operating manual developed from a second EMRO initiative were provided. Such a planwould require systems for education and audit and could be implementedfollowing a pilot project. The need for technical support from selectedexperts and relevant WHO programmes in a long term working relation ship was foreseen. ,2001
1189, lyon1.frWe tested a number of repeat sequences identified from sequenced BACclones covering 100% of the PMP22 duplicated region (MIT Center forGenome Research Cambridge MA USA) for polymorphic behavior. Weselected sequences with (i) five or more tandem repeats and (ii) possess ing neighboring sequences suitable to identify unique primers for specificamplification. Ten such repeat sequences (4 tri 4 tetra and 2 penta nucleotide repeats) were amplified by PCR using standard conditions. Three of this short tandem repeats (STRs) were polymorphic and foundsuitable for genotyping. The heterozygosity for normal controls is between0.69 and 0.80. Less than 1% of healthy controls are non informative for the3 STRs. The PCR products show clean amplification without stutteringbands. The separation of the different alleles is accurate on non denatur 314 Posters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policying polyacrylamide gels and allows economical silver staining detection. When duplicated dosage differences between alleles are observed. The 3STRs cover about 0.5 Mb of the central part of the CMT1A duplication andenclose the PMP22 gene. Until now we found 9 CMT1A families whichshowed normal CMT REP profiles. Very interestingly the most distal of theSTRs revealed the duplication in all 9 families. The frequency of CMT1Aduplication with normal CMT REP profiles is 2.0% in a series of 480 dupli cated CMT 1A patients. Genotyping with these new STRs now definitelyreplaced other polymorphic systems (RFLPs and poly(AC) repeats) in ourroutine diagnosis. An automated genotyping format using 2 different fluo rescent labels was successfully tested. ,2001
1190,The availability of Assisted Reproduction Techniques like ICSI allows pro creation by males with severe infertility problems. The knowledge thatgenetic abnormalities account for many cases of idiophatic infertility led usto evaluate a group of Venezuelan infertile patients. In 1998 we began agenetic evaluation program which includes Y chromosome microdeletionsby PCR mutational analysis of the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis) and inselected cases karyotype. To date we have evaluated a group of 190 con secutive patients with a range of indications for ICSI this group includedazoospermic/oligozoospermic men. Y chromosome microdeletions werefound in 4 patients (one in AZFb and three in AZFc). Abnormal karyotypeswere identified in 4/65 (6%) of the patients (two 45 XY t(14 21) one 47 XXY and one 47 XYY). Mutation analysis of the CFTR gene resulted in onepatient compound heterozygote for Delta F508/R117H and five patientsheterozygote for one mutation in the CFTR gene (two R117H/ twoDeltaF508/ and 621+ G to T/ ). These results demonstrate that geneticfactors are involved in some cases of infertility in Venezuelan males witha frequency (7 %) comparable to that observed worldwide. Therefore inour population a complete genetic evaluation is highly recommendedbefore the ICSI procedure. ,2001
1191, erlangen.deIn tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) parental mosaicism is often observedin a family with more than one affected child from parents without clinicalsigns of TSC. Parental germ line mosaicism can be shown by haplotypeanalyses whereas parental somatic mosaicism is usually detected by areduced ratio of the mutant to normal allele. Direct detection of somaticmosaicism is even more difficult. During mutation screening in TSC wedirectly discovered two monosymptomatic cases of somatic mosaicism ina total of 30 sporadic patients with a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation. A furthercase of parental somatic mosaicism was uncovered by family analysis. The two directly discovered mosaics were initially detected through thesensitivity of the protein truncation test (PTT) and promoted by a predom inance of the mutated allele in lymphoblastoid cell lines compared toperipheral blood cells. Suspected low level mosaicism in lymphocyte DNAcould be proven by cloning of the PCR product and confirmation of a muta tion by sequencing individual clones in one case and selective amplifica tion of the mutated allele after enzymatic digestion of the wildtype allele inthe two other patients. Direct sequence analysis of peripheral blood DNAfailed to confirm the mutations In all three cases no matter what type oflabeling (primer or dideoxynucleotides) and what kind of automaticsequencer (LICOR or ABI310) was used. In contrast the underrepresent ed mutated alleles could be directly detected by DHPLC analysis throughheteroduplex formation. Titration experiments of cloned PCR productscould proof a minimal proportion of 5% of the mutated allele. Our reportillustrate the importance of considering somatic mosaicism in sporadicTSC cases with clinical symptoms restricted to single organs and thenecessity of sensitive methods for their detection. ,2001

Pelz Institut fuer Humangenetik Berlin G', 'In clinical practice it is the obligation of a clinician to treat a patient accord ing to evidence based principles. A quite different situation exists in screen ing where healthy individuals are investigated to identify risks of disorders which justify costs and hazards of further investigation. The situationbecomes even more complex in prenatal diagnosis where in most casesphysicians take action not to treat or to avoid disease but to prevent thebirth of a diseased child. This is the ultimate action which should not betaken by a physician unless the disease is serious and no effective treat ment is available. The antenatal screening for Down syndrome in case ofa positive test results in the overwhelming majority of case in an inducedabortion a consequence broadly accepted in both the medical and thesocial community. In a case control study we investigated different aspectsof quality of life in 51 children with trisomy 21 and in 52 control children oftheir peer group. Parents were personally interviewed with a structuredquestionnaire. Quality of life in children with trisomy 21 can primarily bedefined by good health an intact and caring family environment by inte gration and autonomy. Second rate are those areas where the disabilityshows strongest manifestation somatic intellectual and communicationaldevelopment. Many health problems of children with Down s syndrome aretreatable with modern medical methods integration can be facilitated by anappropriate affectionate and empathic social environment. It seems to bewrong to assume that children with trisomy 21 have a low quality of life. Aninduced abortion after prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21 is not justifiable atleast if one takes/respects the viewpoint of the Down syndrome child. ",2001
1194,Within the different specialities of medicine human genetics is one of theyoungest. The introduction of its concepts and its molecular methods haschanged the understanding of disease and the possibilities of diagnostics. This development is often seen as a paradigm shift and compared with theintroduction of the cellular pathology by Virchow. It has an influence onmedical thinking and on the use of basic medical concepts. Neverthelessthe position of human genetics in the realm of medicine and its role in theclinical setting is far from being clear and established. The present workanalyses the understanding of doctors of tomorrow (1) of human geneticsfunction in the realm of medicine and (2) of terms like prevention dis ease and patient in clinical settings related to human genetics. Three groups of students of medicine differing in the level of clinical and theoret ical experience (first third and sixth year of medical education) were inter viewed by a structured questionnaire focusing on the above mentionedtopics. Human genetics is not seen as a medical discipline in the tradition al sense by the interviewees. The role of human genetics within medicineis seen in diagnostics and in science. It lacks the traditional role of manymedical specialities caring and healing both taking place in the differentspecialities per se. The clinical application leads to dissension s in the con cepts of (1) prevention which in human genetics is mainly understood asprevention of the ill instead of prevention of illness (2) the role of patientand physician which in the setting of prenatal diagnosis is far from clear. This may be one of the problems of human genetics to establish itself as amedical discipline. ,2001
1195,Our understanding of molecular genetics has created new possibilities todiagnose and to treat genetic disorders. This has increased public aware ness of hereditary diseases and there are an increasing number of fami lies requesting genetic services and more physicians prescribing genetictests. Simultaneously there are demands in European countries to cutdown the costs of public health care. All this has created a situation whereprofessional guidelines for the provision of genetic services are needed. InSeptember 2000 an international workshop was organized by the ESHG PPPC in Helsinki to formulate guidelines for the provision of genetic serv ices in Europe. Participants were concerned about equal access and effec tiveness of genetic services quality assessment of services professionaleducation multidisciplinarity and division of tasks as well as networking. Participants identified a number of policy areas requiring (international)coordination and the establishment of coherent (international) policies. Thepurpose of this presentation is to systematically examine the existing pro fessional guidelines legal frameworks and other documents related to theorganization of genetic services mainly from Europe but also from otherinternational organizations. Since professional guidelines can improve thequality appropriateness and cost effectiveness of genetic services andcan serve as valuable educational tools it is important to determine towhat degree they document the best practice standards in which areasthey may be deficient and whether there were changes over time. Thisreview is an essential step to lead to the efficiency in use of health careresources and the establishment of common guidelines for all Europeancountries. ,2001

1197,Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and its allelic milder form BeckerMuscular Dystrophy (BMD) account for 50% of all muscular dystrophiesand are caused by mutations on Dystrophin gene. Deletions and duplica tions are responsible for two third of cases of affected males and theremaining 30% is caused by point mutations. Disease prevention is per formed by carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis (PND). Risk evaluationneeds to be defined before performing PND but often women at risk arealready pregnant when decide to ask per PND. If deletions or duplicationsare not detected either on index case or on at risk women point mutationanalysis should be performed but since Dystrophin gene is the largest dis covered to date in humans (79 exons) point mutation analysis is too timeconsuming to be performed in PND. Our centre is performing familial stud ies and prenatal diagnoses of DMD/BMD on Italian population since 1987.Our registry includes more than 1000 family groups and we performed 586prenatal diagnoses over a period of 13 years. Our experience combined totechnological progress allowed us to set up an easy and fast strategy foraccurate carrier detection and PND. Deletion and duplication detection formales and females by Quantitative Multiplex PCR Etidium Bromide stainedon 32 exons and PCR based linkage analysis using very informative STRand RFLP can actually be performed with low costs and good accuracy in5 days. Of 317 PND carried out on male foetuses 182 diagnoses ofhealthy males were confirmed at birth by follow up. Our experience both atlaboratory level and at counselling level have improved the quality of theservice offered. We observed an interesting evolution of the risk modifica tion during the years with the reduction of pregnancies with foetuses withintermediate risk. ,2001
1198,Since 1960s improved definition diagnosis and reporting of gastroschisis(G) and omphalocele (O) have shown that the frequency of gastroschisisis on the increase. While most large studies document this increase thetextbooks in English still state that O (incidence of 1 4 000) is more com mon that G (incidence 1 6 000). Retrospective analysis of all 36 665probands/families evaluated at the USF genetics clinic between January 2 1982 and December 31 1999 showed 121 patients with G and 98 with O. The higher number of G reversed the customary G O incidence ratio of1/6 000 1/4 000. Of the G patients 37/121 had karyotypes all were normal. In the O cohort 75/98 had karyotypes and 18 were abnormal (24%) 12/18had trisomy 18 2/18 trisomy 21 1/18 trisomy 13 1/18 del (18p)/i (18q) 1/18 inv (2)(p11q12) mat and 1/18 inv (3)(p13q11) mat. In the G cohort43/121 (36%) had associated anomalies compared to the O cohort with67/98 (68%). 5/121 pregnancies with G were interrupted 2/121 miscarriedand there were 2 stillbirths. 33 pregnancies remained with unknown to usoutcome (lost to reevaluations). Among the 79 liveborn the prematurity ratewas 57%. 11/98 O pregnancies were electively interrupted additional 6/98miscarried and 23 remained with unknown outcome. Among the 58 live born patients the prematurity rate was 36%. The mortality rate in the Gcohort was 9% (7/79) and in the O cohort it was 15% (9/58). This studycontributed to several issues in these abdominal defects G is more com mon that O has lower mortality rate and higher rate of prematurity com pared to O. ,2001
1199,Male factor is the cause of infertility in about 50 per cent of infertile cou ples. Five to twently per cent of infertile men with severe oligozoospermiaor azoospermia have Yq microdeletion. Recent studies has shown thepresence of 4 regions on the internal 6 of Y chromosome associated withmale infertility. These are AZFa AZFb AZFc and AZFd which are involvedin the process of spermatogenesis. DAZ and RBM are two multicopy genefamilies which are expressed only in testes and have an important role inspermatogenesis. They are located at AZFc and AZFb respectively. Microdeletions in theses regions cause severe oligozoospermia orazoospermia. In this study 30 STSs were selcted to screen for Yqmicrodeletions in patients with severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia .Cytogenetic urologic hormonal and other organic causes leading toazoospermia and oligozoospermia were ruled out in these patients. Yqmicrodeletion was detected in 4 out of 16 patients. ,2001
1200, thalassemia is one of the most prevalent haemoglobin disorders in theworld. The molecular basis of a thalassemia are deletions of variablelenght involving one or both a genes at the a globin gene cluster. Func tional point mutations leading to inactivation of the a genes are less fre quent. So far no comprehensive population screening for a thalassemiahas been performed in Iran and no molecular diagnostic services are avail able for this disease. As a result a considerable number of patients withmicrocytic hypochromic anemia and normal Hb A2 levels might be misdi agnosed as silent b thalassemia or the molecular basis of disease remainsunidentified. In this study we have screened 25 Iranian patients randomlychosen from a pool of patients with microcytic hypochromic anemia andnegative results in b thalassemia genotyping for the 2 most frequent a tha lassemia deletions ( a 3.7 a 4.2). Analysis was performed using deletion specific PCR amplification followed by agarose gel electrophoresis of theresulting PCR fragments. No a 4.2 deletion was detected. However 40 %of analyzed cases demonstrated the a 3.7 deletion either in the homozy gous or heterozygous state. This study suggests that the a 3.7 deletion iscommon cause of microcytic hypochromic anemia in Iran. The results arein accordance with previous studies reporting a remarkable high frequen cy of a 3.7 in the Middle East. Routine screening for this mutation willimprove the molecular diagnosis of anemia in Iran. ,2001
1201,As large scale screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis based on theimmunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)/DNA protocol is being considered thereis a need for a DNA method which can simultaneously detect many muta tions and is suitable for blood spots. We evaluated the INNO LiPA CFTR12and INNO LiPA CFTR17+Tn tests which detect 29 mutations (and the Tnalleles) and their wild type sequences in the CFTR gene to assess theirsuitability for routine analysis of blood spot samples. Both tests are lineprobe assays (LiPAs) based on the reverse hybridization principle. Usingthese tests and depending on the country up to 94% of the mutant allelescan be detected. We defined an extraction method that is easy and rapidto perform. This method was tested with twenty random samples. Resultsshowed that a small adaptation of the multiplex amplification profile of theINNO LiPA CFTR tests (increase in the number of cycles from 30 to 35)was necessary. After increasing the number of amplification cycles allDNA samples were successfully amplified. The hybridization results werecomparable to those obtained with samples extracted from whole blood. Test results were concordant with data obtained using other mutationdetection methods. These results indicate that the INNO LiPA CFTR12 andINNO LiPA CFTR17+Tn tests are suitable for the detection and identifica tion of an important number of CF mutations in the CFTR gene using bloodspots. ,2001
1202,Steinert s myotonic dystrophy (SMD) the most frequent myopathy of theadult is a multisystemic disease. SMD is characterized by myotonia mus cular dystrophy cataract hypogonadism frontal alopecia and ECGchanges. SMD is genetically and clinically heterogeneous. SMD an auto somal dominant disease is caused by mutations of the myotonin genePosters: Genetic Services Genetic Screening and Public Policy 317located in 19q13.3. The genetic defect consists in the amplification of the CTG triplet from the region 3 of the myotonin gene. The severity of thesymptoms depends on the number of CTG triplet repeats 3 35 repeats inhealthy persons 50 100 repeats in premutation carriers 100 2000 repeatsin affected patients (2000 or more repeats in severely affected patients).According to the onset age and the severity of symptoms the followingSMD forms are known adult (classical onset at 25 35 years slow evolu tion) congenital (neonatal dramatic evolution) infantile (onset at 5 10years slow evolution) and minimal (onset after 50 years). This study wasperformed on the 188 SMD cases admitted to the Horia Radu Center ofNeuromuscular Pathology Valcele Covasna in the period 1986 1999. Thestudy methods used were the familial inquiry completion of the geneticrecord reconstruction of pedigrees and the biostatistical method. Theanalysis of pedigrees confirms the autosomal dominant transmission ofSMD. The SMD cases represent 11% of all muscular dystrophy casesadmitted in the same period. We found an increased SMD incidence in thedistricts Brasov Sibiu Timis and Bihor. This can be explained by thefounder couple effect and the different pressure of mutagenic and selectionfactors. ,2001
1203,Genetic testing for molecular defects in the CFTR gene has become animportant area in laboratory testing. However because of the large num ber of documented molecular defects in the CFTR gene only a small num ber of laboratories have implemented the techniques necessary to exhaus tively analyze a patient s CF locus. Nevertheless only a relatively smallhandful of mutations recur at significant frequency and we have developedan assay to test for 25 of these CFTR mutations and polymorphisms rec ommended by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Theassay is capable of detecting 80 90% of the defective alleles in CaucasianAmericans and has a significant detection level in other ethnic groups. Thismay be sufficiently sensitive for routine carrier screening and for the major ity of diagnostic requests. The ability to test for CFTR mutations at themolecular level has already improved the diagnosis of symptomaticpatients and expanded the reproductive options for family members of CFpatients. The same technology also holds promise of identifying asympto matic carriers and at risk couples without family history. Here we report theanalysis of 400 clinical specimens that were previously genotyped by othermethods (restriction enzyme digestion PCR mediated site directed muta genesis DGGE or DNA sequencing) using a striped array of 55 immobi lized sequence specific oligonucleotides designed to detect geneticdefects responsible for CF and other CFTR associated pathologies. Theassay includes 24 mutations with frequencies >= 0.1% in Caucasian pop ulations achieving 80 90% sensitivity and an additional mutation of Africanorigin providing 60 70% coverage among African Americans. GenomicDNA is amplified in a single 15 plex polymerase chain reaction amplifica tion system followed by detection of the 25 mutations and 4 polymorphisms(intron 8 Tn locus I506V I507V and F508C) using a low density oligonu cleotide probe array. The format of the assay permits the simultaneousscreening of many samples for multiple mutations and can be readily mod ified to combine the detection of the most frequent mutations with otherallelic variants common to specific ethnic groups. Expanding the panel ofscreened mutations only marginally increases the sensitivity of the assay. This molecular diagnostic assay is simple and accurate. The assay identi fies most of the carriers and affected persons (high sensitivity) with fewfalse positives (high specificity) and may be used in carrier screening andin conjunction with conventional tests for newborn screening. ,2001
1204,Abstract Genetic Testing and Human Resource Management Corporationsare faced with the fact that employees with unstable health conditions areless resourceful due to their absence from the workplace caused by sick ness. Genetic testing seems to be a method in human resource manage ment to find out about genetically caused health problems of employees. As a result corporations start to use genetic testing as a guiding toolthroughout their recruitment procedures for potential candidates. The aim of this primarily investigation is to examine the opinions and expectationsof personnel managers of the Migros Genossenschafts Bund (MGB) inSwitzerland regarding the use of genetic testing in human resource man agement. To carry out this task questionnaires have been answered by allMGB personnel managers. Secondly group discussions with these man agers representing 80.000 employees in industrial service and associa tion sectors have been conducted. MGB s code of conduct supports relia bility confidence and ethical aspects. The author would like to thank MGBas the first corporation in Switzerland for its visionary permission to thisinquiry. ,2001
1205,Background Genetic criteria become increasingly important in the treat ment stratification of pediatric tumors. Amplification of the MYCN onco gene is one of the most powerful markers indicating an aggressive tumorbehavior and is consequently used for therapy stratification. A quality con trol study was initiated by the ENQUA Group to guarantee reliable and uni form quality of MYCN data and of other genetic features the prognostic impact of which is evaluated prospectively. Methods A panel of twelve coded tumor specimens was analyzed ineleven laboratories from nine European countries. Southern blot (SB) PCR and FISH were used for MYCN and chromosome 1p36.3 evaluation and flow FCM/ICM for tumor cell ploidy assessment. Results Altogether 350 investigations were performed leading to 23 diver gent findings (8/160 MYCN 9/114 1p36.3 and 7/42 ploidy results). 34results were judged as not evaluable. No or incorrect determination of thetumor cell content turned out to be one of the biggest problems leading toresults based on the investigation of normal cells. After discussions andreviews of the tumor samples 17 of 23 differing findings were judged asfalse results. The diagnostic errors were lowest for MYCN analyses deter mined by SB (3.7%) and FISH (4.1%) and highest for ICM (17.3%).Conclusions This study demonstrated the difficulties and limitations foreach technique and the problems in the evaluation and interpretation of theresults. Moreover it led to technique standardization and to the develop ment of a common language for the interpretation of the molecular genet ic results which is based on uniform and unequivocal definitions. The project has been funded by the DGV No. 98 36220 ,2001
1206,The issue of non paternity where the presumed father is not the biologicalfather has become more prominent in recent years because of the relia bility and reduced costs of DNA based testing and because of theincreased emphasis that governments have been placing on child supportand its enforcement.

1207,Current world wide genome projects confront scientists with a wealth ofsequence information. Both the sizes and the number of biological data bases grow exponentially. Intelligent systems are needed to bridge thewidening chasm between data collection and interpretation. To interpretdata from newly sequenced pro and eukaryotic genomes comparativegenomics is rapidly gaining importance. Even distant organisms encodeproteins with high sequence similarity. Gene order in different genomes isalso well conserved. We have employed both these observations to createa versatile computational genome comparison system(genomeSCOUTÃ¢\x80\x9c). This application can be used for projects spanning318 Posters: Genomics and Bioinformaticsfrom the identification of drug targets or the optimization of organisms for biotechnology to in depth characterization and encyclopedic annotation ofcompleted or partial genomes. This application is based on the well estab lished data integration system SRS [Etzold T. et al. 1996. Methods Enzy mol. 266 114 128]. In a first step information about gene order and pro tein homology (e.g. homologs orthologs and clusters of orthologousgroups COGs) is efficiently collected and automatically stored in five sep arate databases. Next these databases are queried interactively to carryout the actual genome comparisons. Key benefits 1. High speed handlingof large genomic data sets. The most complex queries give results instant ly. 2. User friendly graphical representations of search results 3. Unique SRS based linking functions between all databases result in the accumu lation of a wealth of biological information 4. Reliable addition of genomesis straightforward and 5. High flexibility allows effortless integration ofadditional public or proprietary databanks and applications.(http //www.lionbioscience.com/) ,2001
1208,"We have recently increased our resources to enable us to tackle the taskof assigning symbols for the whole of the human genome. Despite calls togive each gene a unique reference number there is still a need for sym bols for genes especially when they are discussed in the literature. Stan dardised gene nomenclature is an essential resource and the HUGO GeneNomenclature Committee (HGNC) is committed to supplying unique genesymbols and names for the ever growing number of human genes. Desig nations describing structure function or homology are preferred wherepossible. We work closely with authors and researchers in each field online databases such as LocusLink and EnsEMBL and other speciesspecific databases in particular the Mouse Genome Informatics Nomen clature Committee. We have already assigned symbols for the finishedsequences for chromosomes 22 and 21 (Dunham et al. 1999 Hattori et al.2000) providing a total of nearly 600 approved symbols and have recent ly been working on new data sent to us by various sequencing centres. Indeed for the chromosome 21 publication we were able to ensure that88% of the genes (including pseudogenes) had approved symbols. Withthe ever increasing use of electronic databases this will greatly aid futureinformation retrieval for all interested in the human genome.

1209,The laboratory mouse is the premier model for understanding human biol ogy and disease. Much contemporary research focuses on comparativeanalysis of mouse and human sequence data with emerging function ofbiology implications. Thus annotating the mouse genomic sequence andintegrating biological knowledge are of vital importance to the scientificcommunity. The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) is the community data base for comprehensive information on the mouse. MGD provides a fullrange of information including genomic structural and phenotypic data ongene definition identification classifications and nomenclature genetic cytogenetic physical and (species) comparative maps and data support ing those maps clones/ESTs/probes/PCR characterizations and sequencelinks for DNA and proteins allelic polymorphism data mammalian homolo gies for model organisms and domestic species and descriptive pheno typic information for genes mutations and mouse strains. MGD is inter connected with other online resources such as SWISS PROT LocusLink GenBank PubMed OMIM and databases for other species includingGDB RatMap SheepBase PiGbase BovMap FlyBase etc. Two new fea tures have recently been added to MGD. The first is the use of controlledvocabularies for the description of the molecular function biologicalprocess and cellular component of gene products as part of the GeneOntology (GO) project. These terms can be used as attributes of geneproducts across species contributing to the development of comprehen sive comparative maps and facilitating queries across multiple databases. The second recent feature of MGD is allele description enhancements developed in part to support the explosion in new mutant allele discoveryfrom mutagenesis projects and gene targeting efforts. Allele records now include information on inheritance and the molecular mutation involved and are being annotated with phenotypic data and human disease modelinformation. All allele data are fully integrated with sequence ortholog gene expression and strain polymorphism data. MGD is supported by NIHgrant HG00330 ,2001
1210,Genetics has become one of he most rapidly expanding sciences. It is verydifficult keeping up to date using conventional methods such as reviewingprinted journals catalogs or scientific textbooks. The use of electronicpublications and databases have therefore became essential for geneti cists. Information obtained owing to Human Genome Project and researchefforts around the world is stored and classified in a growing number ofdatabases that are accessed through the Internet. In addition many of thescientific journals focused in genetics have generated their own Web sites from where it is possible to have access in variable degree to its content. However recent rapid proliferation of these and other kinds of webresources for geneticist may confuse new potential users. We are present ing a new web site called Turbogene. The purpose of our site is to providea powerful access tool to genetic web resources. The current content of thesite is divided in several main categories Journals Databases Softwareand Societies. The Journals option displays a listing of links for over 120scientific journals whose main interest is focused to genetics and molecu lar biology. The Databases option includes over 50 links subdivided inthe following categories Inherited Disorders Dysmorphology Cytogenet ics Genomics Mutations Proteins Enzymes Mitochondrials Laboratoryresources and Support groups. The Software option is a catalog of pro grams used to pedigree analysis primers design sequence analysis andlinkage analysis. The content of the site is updated every week.

1211,With a growing number of genomes close to completion Proteome s Bio Knowledge Library Ã¢\x80\x9c provides a unique resource built by comprehensivecuration of the research literature for model organisms S.cerevisiae (YPDÃ¢\x80\x9c) S.pombe (PombePDÃ¢\x80\x9c) C.elegans (WormPD Ã¢\x80\x9c) C.albicans(PathoPD Ã¢\x80\x9c) and for human mouse and rat proteins (HumanPSDÃ¢\x80\x9c).Using the sequenced genomes as frameworks our curators collect proteinknowledge currently scattered throughout the literature and put it into aconcise format. The information is available in both a highly navigable for mat and a relational format which allows for convenient data mining. Appli cations for the BioKnowledge LibraryÃ¢\x80\x9c include genome annotation com parative genomics interpretation of functional genomics proteomicdatasets and disease and pathway studies. The Human Proteome SurveyDatabase (HumanPSDÃ¢\x80\x9c) a component of the BioKnowledge Library Ã¢\x80\x9c contains up to date information for over 10 000 known human proteins 6 000 mouse proteins and 3 000 rat proteins. An additional component isGPCR PD Ã¢\x80\x9c which represents in depth annotation of the literature for theG protein coupled receptors an important class of drug target proteins their ligands and their associated signaling pathways. As the sequence ofthe human genome is completed annotations for predicted human pro teins are being added with the intention of creating the complete Annotat ed Human Proteome. The model organism volumes are freely available toacademic researchers while subscriptions are available to all others(www.proteome.com). ,2001
1212,A rough draft of approximately 90% of the human genomic sequences isnow available in the public domain. Interpretation and extraction of knowl edge from these sequences represent a challenge for scientific communi ty. In this presentation we will discuss our current efforts to utilize thesesequences in order to create the best view of the human genome. In addi tion we will present a computational environment that can be used for effi cient integration of diverse but relevant biological information. DoubleTwistPosters: Genomics and Bioinformatics 319provides a system that allows easy and comprehensive analysis against all publicly available human genome sequence data whether finished orframework sequences. Gene models from the majority of the human geneshave been derived. SNP information has been integrated in the genomeview as well as in each gene model. Using a sophisticated JAVA basedviewer scientists are able to visualize similarities to protein and proteindomain signatures alternative splicing information SNPs Mapping infor mation as well as a comparative view between human and mouse genes. In our view the human genome serves as a scaffold to integrate differentdata types including expression genotyping and pharmacogenomics infor mation. Our system is based on an open architecture paradigm whichallows such easy integration of all the diverse types of information on topof the genomic information. ,2001
1213,Even now that the sequencing of the human genome is nearly complete scientists are still only at the threshold of understanding the functions ofindividual genes. Kelman offers a high end solution of bioinfomatics andfunctional genome research which ensures new levels of data consistencyand exploitation. By means of the SPRAB technology we can predict thegenetically determined functional relationships between proteins. Result ing from the in silico protein protein interaction mapping we are able toconstruct a GeneNetwork which provides an indepth understanding ofgene interplay because it involves gene products in all their known molec ular versions. So it becomes possible to embed every DNA sequence in anetwork of other genes to find functional connections which otherwisewouldn t have attracted attention. This unique approach is now completedby a novel tool for visualization of data and for navigation within the net work of physical protein protein interactions the NetNavigator. Networkand navigation tool are provided with an easy to handle user interface sooffering the opportunity for efficient analyses of the growing amount offunctional gene data according to different criteria. The application of Kel man s tools is exemplified here by means of a case study in the field ofneuro degenerative diseases. The computational protein protein interac tion mapping approach uncovered stringent relations between genesinvolved in neuro degenerative pathologies with hereditary background. ,2001
1214,Proteomics seeks to provide structural and functional information for allproteins specifically referring to individual genomes. The true value of thegenome sequence information will be realized when a function is assignedto all encoded proteins. In our effort to provide a complete solution forbioinformatics tools we provide online agents and behind the firewall prod ucts. DoubleTwist has partnered with Molecular Simulations Inc (MSI) toprovide on line bioinformatics tools to help in assigning molecular functionto protein sequences. FoldSearch is the first available Agent. This Agent isbuilt on MSI s SeqFold technology. And provides an ability to search forhomologous sequences when sequence identity is too low for standardsequence search engines. FoldSearch searches a submitted proteinsequence with a protein folds library curated from the PDB. The Fold Search Agent identifies similar protein sequences bases upon protein pri mary and secondary structure considerations. In my talk I will discuss thesoftware and the scientific details of FoldSearch and its use via the Inter net. ,2001
1215,The identification of specific targets for diagnostic or therapeutic use hasbeen a principle goal for both clinicians and biomedical researches. So far in biomedical research major methods for identification of disease genesis based on positional cloning and linkage and linkage disequilibriumanalyses. In this report a new paradigm which incorporate feature selec tion into gene expression recognition will be proposed for the discovery of disease genes and biomarkers for diagnosis drug efficacy and toxicity. The feature selection is defined as selecting a subset of features (genes)out of original candidate features that performs the best under some datamining systems. Since criterion for feature selection is fundamental to theidentification of biomarkers several criteria based on separability andinformation measures will be proposed. The wrapper which involves lineardiscriminant analysis logistic regression and support vector machines and filter methods will be studied. Tabu serach algorithms will be utilized toselect best subsets of genes according to criterion values. The proposedmethods for gene identification will be applied to colon and breast geneexpression data sets. The impact of the criteria various learning algo rithms and searching techniques on the classification capacities will beevaluated and the biological implication of identified genes by the pro posed methods will be explored using these two data sets ,2001
1216,We developed a SQL (structured query language) database with pheno type information to support analysis of our single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) genotyping data as part of our goal to characterize gene variantsrelated to complex diseases. The SQL database was designed containinggenotypes diagnoses and responses to questions requiring the subject togive a discrete rating. A multidimensional on line analytical processing(MOLAP) database was constructed using the data contained in the origi nal SQL database. The MOLAP database (example here called Finn) usesa cube structure in place of the two dimensional tables seen in typical SQLdatabases. The data in these cubes can be viewed in the form of a pivottable using an Internet browser or a spreadsheet application. The pivottable produced here represents data from the cube in the MOLAP data base containing dimensions for genotyping results of the serotonin recep tor HTR2a 1438 G > A SNP subject diagnosis (based on a SCID (Struc tured Clinical Interview for DSM IV Axis I Disorders) results)) of alcoholdependence (Dx code = 12) and their rated response to the question Howoften do you drink alone? (depicted as alone 50 = 50 percent of the time).Implementing MOLAP cubes containing the dimensions necessary to sup port complex trait analysis enables us to review the data prior to perform ing a statistical analysis. ,2001
1217,Data collection management and control are key stages in the geneticstudy. The relation Database (DB) was set up for the case register ofpatients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) resident in Nuoro province Sardinia Italy a sampling frame for epidemiological and genetic study. Clinical demographical and genetic information obtained for MS patients and theirfamilies were managed under MS Access 7.0 software. As to high preva lence of MS and relatively low population density in Sardinia it was expect ed to find many common relatives among patients family members. DBstructure was developed with the purpose to analyse extended pedigrees. Special tools were developed to export pedigree data into programmes for320 Posters: Genomics and Bioinformaticsgenetic analysis. During data insertion DB automatically searches for iden tical demographic and personal data and establishes simple links of thetype mother child or father child between individuals. This tool allowsto construct many generations pedigree for any individual of the DB. At themoment DB contains family data for 320 MS patients among 470 in thecase register. 69 multiplex cases of 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and higher degree ofrelationship were found among them. Some of the relationships betweenindividuals were found automatically without knowing them a priori. Wefound this relation DB to be the useful tool for data control and manage ment in a genetic study carried out in an archaic isolated geneticallyhomogeneous inbred population. It allows us to manage a very complexdata set that will also include in the future genotyping data. ,2001
1218,To decipher genes responsible for heart development and malfunction inhuman we set up a database linking gene expression profiles of myocar dial samples from patients suffering from congenital heart diseases to theanatomical state and clinical data. The samples are processed by complexRNA hybridisation on cDNA filter containing PCR products of 72.000clones (Human Unigene Set). The filters are exposed in a phosporimagerand automatically assessed. For phenotyping a dedicated diagnosticscheme allows us to distinguish between separate cardiac morphologicaland hemodynamical features rather than to rely exclusively on the diagno sis. Expression profiles and diagnostic criteria are managed by a non com mercial database system (MySQL) with a web based interface. The sys tem permits the search for differentially expressed genes correlated toselected cardiac anatomical features lists all informations available for agene or clone and integrates our internal database. Furthermore it will pro vide links to Internet databases for the sequence of interest. The integra tion of different species (e.g. mouse rat and zebrafish) is planned for thefuture. The obtained data should enable us to identify genes involved inheart development as well as genes responsible for adaptation mechanisminfluenced by hemodynamical changes correlated to the heart malforma tion. With these data new targets for cardiac adaptation to common dis eases like hypertension or heart failure should be identified. ,2001
1219,As part of our attempt to use phylogenetic data for the functional charac terization of novel proteins we have developed a 3D structure basedapproach to establish very ancient divergences within a complex proteinsuperfamily. In implementing this approach pairwise superpositions of X ray structures are used to calculate similarity scores as input for a neigh bour joining tree building algorithm. The resulting phylogeny is validatedby comparison with the results of sequence based algorithms and bio chemical data. It is also possible to use the 3D data as a template for thereliable determination of the phylogenetic position of novel proteins as afirst step towards functional predictions. As an examplary application wehave analysed the short chain alcohol dehydrogenases (SCAD) a largeand diverse superfamily of ancient origin. Several of its members play arole in human physiology and disease especially in the metabolism ofsteroid substrates (e.g. progestins estrogens androgens and corticos teroids). Their involvement in common human disorders such as cancer osteoporosis and Alzheimer disease makes them important candidatedrug targets. Using the 3D structure based approach we were able to dis cern new patterns in the phylogenetic relationships of the SCAD super family including a basal dichotomy of the 17beta hydroxysteroid dehydro genases. Using those results as background we were able to assign unex pected functions to some recently described SCAD members. ,2001
1220,Hereditary deficiency in human Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase(G6PD) is estimated to affect about 400 million people world wide. Thehighest prevalence rates are found in tropical Africa the Middle East andsub tropical Asia some parts of the Mediterranean and in Papua NewGuinea. The most common clinical manifestations of G6PD deficiency areneonatal jaundice and acute haemolytic anaemia. AIDBase G6PD(http //www.bioinf.org.uk/g6pd/) is a newly created web accessible rela tional database of human Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)mutations. It integrates mutations at the DNA and protein levels with clini cal manifestations references to the biochemical variants initially docu mented and structural consequences of the mutations. The database pro vides a form for submitting additional mutation data and can perform anautomatic analysis of mutations likely to have a significant impact on thestructure of the protein. This procedure identifies mutations which distortsecondary structure destroy hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interac tions or simply cause bad clashes. Residues involved in the active site andthe dimer interface and residues conserved among the G6PD of differentspecies have also been identified. The database is also linked to othermajor bioinformatics mutation disease and health care databases e.g. OMIM HGMD HGBASE and PDB relevant to understanding G6PD defi ciency and its management. The database can provide both scienceresearchers and clinicians insights into the molecular aspects and clinicalsignificance of G6PD deficiency. It also facilitates the understanding of thestructure and function relationships of the enzyme. ,2001
1221, wuerzburg.deAge related macular degeneration (AMD) is an increasingly common mul tifactorial disorder causing severe vision impairment among the elderlypopulation. With no effective therapy available at present the identificationof predisposing genetic factors and the determination of their contributionto AMD is urgently needed. Towards this goal we are pursuing a strategythat is based on in silico EST expression profiling and which is aimed at thegeneration of a comprehensive catalogue of genes preferentially active inthe human retina. Subsequently these genes will be assessed in SNP based association studies in large AMD cohorts. As a first step retina ESTsampling was performed in the UniGene database and has identified atotal of 1241 EST clusters with at least 30% of the ESTs in each clusteroriginating from retina cDNA libraries. In a pilot study 180 clusters withvarying retina and non retina EST contents were analyzed for their in vitroexpression by RT PCR. This approach identified 69 clusters representinggenes with putative retina or retina/neural specific transcription. Thus far six retinal genes have been fully characterized and include four genes withunknown function as well as two genes belonging to well characterizedgene families. Another three clusters correspond to transcripts previouslyidentified by the Kazusa cDNA sequencing project. At least ten of the 69clusters are located in non coding regions of known human or rodentgenes and thus may represent partially spliced transcripts. Extrapolation ofour preliminary results suggests that at least 130 genes within the select ed 1241 EST clusters may have a specific function in the neuronal tissuesincluding the retina. nan,2001
1222,Familial juvenile hyperuricaemic nephropathy (FJHN) is an autosomaldominant renal disease characterized by juvenile onset of hyperuricemia gouty arthritis and progressive renal failure at an early age. Recently wehave identified a locus for FJHN on chromosome 16p11.2 and found evi dence for genetic heterogeneity and reduced penetrance of the disease(Stiburkov et al (2000) Am J Hum Genet 66 1989 1994). Our results and a recent publication on localization of the FJHN gene in another family(Kamatani et al. (2000) Arthritis Rheum 43 925 9) have narrowed the 1.7cM candidate region between markers D16S403 and D16S3113. BACPosters: Genomics and Bioinformatics 321clones spanning approximately 2 Mb of critical region were isolated and a physical map is constructed using a combination of STS content analysisand BAC ends sequencing. Known genomic sequences of the clones wereBLASTed against various EST and protein databases. So far these analy ses revealed presence of 10 known genes and 69 putative transcripts. Cor responding EST clones were isolated and sequenced. Full length cDNAsare currently being PCR RACEd sequenced and its expression profilesare studied on a multiple tissue cDNA panel. Genes expressed in the kid ney are prioritized for mutation analysis in affected pedigrees. ,2001
1223,In eukaryotic cells there exist systems that recognize and degrade mRNAswith premature termination codons (PTC). This process is named non sense mediated decay (NMD). We have studied the possible involvementof the NMD system on MCAD mutations. We used analysis of cDNA from>30 unrelated patients to evaluate the effect on mRNA levels of >20 differ ent (missense silent splice PTC) MCAD mutations. Most patients arecompound heterozygotes with the prevalent mutation 985G in one allele. Therefore we could monitor the amounts of mRNA from alleles with 20 dif ferent mutations using allele specific quantitation in a LightCycler based985G assay. Patients having two PTC mutations were studied by PCR ofcDNA and northern blotting. All PTC mutations located upstream of the lastexon resulted in low levels of mRNA whereas a PTC in the last exon ormutation of the translation initiation codon did not affect mRNA amounts. By adding translation blockers to patient cell cultures we could demon strate that NMD in MCAD is translation dependent. To our surprise alsosome of the missense mutations had drastic effects on MCAD mRNAamounts. One of the missense mutations that did not create a pseudos plice site resulted in complete exon skipping and we speculate that it dis rupts an exonic splice enhancer. Studies employing mini gene constructsis in progress in our laboratory. We speculate that aberrant mRNA pro cessing caused by coding region mutations may be more frequent thanpreviously thought. ,2001
1224,Several linkage studies have implicated markers in the vicinity of the alpha 7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor subunit gene (CHRNA7) on chromosome15q13 q14 in both schizophrenia and epilepsy. However this region iscomplicated by the presence of a partial duplication of exons 5 10 ofCHRNA7. We have made a detailed study of genomic clones in the humandatabases to construct a physical map of this complex region. This hasidentified clones defining three types of gene CHRNA7 several copies ofa novel putative gene and a hybrid between the two. The upstreamsequences of the novel and hybrid genes contain four previously identifiedexons plus a novel exon. The downstream sequence of the novel genecontains three novel exons. The central six exons of this eight exon cas sette are part of a 23 exon putative kinase gene on chromosome 3 whilethe 5 and 3 most exons are found only on chromosome 15. A fourth lessconserved copy of most of this cassette has also been identified on a dif ferent chromosome 15 segment. We have constructed a >2.8 Mb physicalmap of the region from BAC and PAC sequences deposited in databases. The map places the partial duplication in opposite orientation to nan,2001
1225,A group of four corneal dystrophies inherited in an autosomal dominantpattern are characterized by bilaterally symmetrical disorder with progres sive accumulation of corneal deposits that begin to appear during the first two decade of life. Progressively these opacities cause serious visualhandicaps often requiring phototherapeutic keratectomy or corneal trans plantation. A single gene BIGH3 was identified accounting for all four dis orders Granular Lattice type I Adeline and Reis Buckler and localized onhuman chromosome 5. Experiments have been done with different ethnicpopulation to study the hot spot nature of these mutations. We have stud ied a total of 4 families affected with Granular corneal dystrophy (CDGG1) Reis Buckler (CDRB) and Lattice type I (CDL1). SSCP analysis was car ried out on 47 members of a Reis Buckler family with 10 affected and 21affected 80 unaffected for a Granular corneal dystrophy family and .Sequence analysis revealed a R555Q mutation for the CDRB family R555W mutation for the CDGG1 families and R124C for the CDL1 family. We carried out haplotype analysis on our individuals which represent Cau casian and on family from Sri Lanka. Our results support the hot spot the ory instead of the common ancestor hypothesis to account for the muta tions. nan,2001
1226,Allelic imbalance (loss of heterozygosity) studies of 41 markers on chro mosome 17 in nineteen Barrett s Oesophageal Cancer (BOC) specimenshave identified thirteen common minimally deleted regions (MRs I XIII).MRs II VII and VIII are located at the sites of the Tumour SuppressorGenes p53 NF1 and BRCA1 respectively MRs III IV V (C17p) and VI IX XII XIII (C17q) are novel regions. The highest frequency of loss of het erozygosity (LOH) was observed at MRIII (91%) which is centromeric tobut distinct from p53. Twenty three premalignant and BOC tissue samplestaken throughout the length of five oesophagectomy specimens were alsoanalysed for C17 LOH. We found evidence for a clonal pathway of LOH infour specimens that began as one or more small deletions in histological ly early tissue spreading to larger deletions in BOC. LOH at MRIII wasseen in the histologically earliest tissue in all five specimens. The minimalregion at MRIII is 300 400 kb in size is contained on three BAC clones two of which have been completely sequenced while sequencing of thethird is underway. Analysis of this sequence data has shown that MRIIIcontains at least four characterised genes and a possible further elevenpreviously undescribed genes from the EST data. We are currently char acterising these putative cancer associated genes for BOC and investigat ing mutation patterns in affected tissue. ,2001
1227,"The association between the autosomal dominant skin disorder tylosis and oesophageal carcinoma has been identified in 2 large families in theUK and USA and a smaller German family. The disease locus was mappedby haplotype analysis to chromosome 17q25. Physical mapping showsthat the 0.5Mb minimal region is covered contiguously by 3 BAC clones. The sequence data for 2/3 of this region is available in the public domainand analysis has been carried out using the NIX suite of programs avail able from the UK Human Genome Mapping Project (HGMP). NIX analysisidentified at least 10 characterised candidate genes in the TOC minimalregion and at least 40 other previously uncharacterised gene fragments. GalNAcI alpha 2 6 sialyl transferase and GalNAcII alpha 2 6 sialyl trans ferase (SThM) map to the proximal end of the TOC minimal region andmay be involved in the development of cancer. The intron/exon structure ofthe genes was confirmed by EST alignment using Sequencher. Both geneswere analysed for polymorphisms and mutations in the coding regionsusing family members. Two polymorphisms were identified in SThM in the5 UTR and intron 7 but these were shown not to be tylosis specific. Expres sion data for both genes in a variety of normal and tumour tissues will alsobe presented. The criteria used to select further candidate genes for analy sis will be discussed.322 Posters: Genomics and BioinformaticsP1136. Exclusion of six candidate genes in distal hereditary motor neuropathy type II linked to chromosome 12q24. J. I. Irobi E. Nelis J. Meuleman K. Venken E. De Vriendt P. De Jonghe C. Van Broeckhoven V. TimmermanMolecular Genetics Laboratory Flanders Interuniversity Institute forBiotechnology (VIB) Department of Neurology University HospitalAntwerp (UZA) University of Antwerp (UIA) Antwerpen B', 'Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (distal HMN) are clinically and genet ically heterogeneous and are divided in seven subtypes according to modeof inheritance age at onset and clinical evolution. We performed agenome wide search in a multigenerational Belgian pedigree with autoso mal dominant distal HMN type II. Significant linkage was obtained betweenmarkers D12S86 and D12S340 suggesting that a gene causing distalHMN II is located on chromosome 12q24.3. In a previous mutation analy sis we were able to exclude the human phospholipase A2 gene (PLA2A)as the responsible gene for distal HMN II. Here we report the exclusion ofsix other known genes all located within the distal HMN II region Twocytoskeletal proteins (paxillin and restin) acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein(RPLP0) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NM23 NDP Kinase) andtwo ESTs one homologous to a human G protein coupled receptor(HM74) gene and the other to a human voltage gated calcium channelbeta subunit (CACNÃÂ§3). The coding region of these positional as well asfunctional candidate genes for distal HMN II were analysed in patients andhealthy individuals for possible mutations.

1228, muenchen.deDifferent disease entities like two syndromic forms of mental retardation diabetes mellitus type I and two eye diseases have been mapped to theshort arm of the X chromosome including the Xp11.4 region. In order toisolate genes involved in these conditions we have constructed a com plete BAC/PAC contig for the Xp11.4 region between markers DXS8025and DXS228 encompassing about 3.0 Mb. For the proximal part of thisregion between DXS993 and DXS228 a complete transcription map wasestablished. Six distinct genes were found in this 1.5 Mb large interval fourof them were screened for mutations in patients with the complete form ofcongenital stationary night blindness (CSNB1). A novel gene termed NYX(Nyctalopin on X chromosome) was found to be mutated in CSNB1 fami lies (Pusch et al. Nature Genetics 2000). NYX is widely and low expressedand codes for a 481 amino acid protein (nyctalopin). In order to identifycandidate genes for X linked cone dystrophy (COD1) we are nowanalysing the 1.5 Mb large distal part of the contig (DXS8025 DXS993).Sequence analysis resulted in the identification of three genes so far. Theyescape X inactivation and are currently screened for mutations in COD1families. Genes isolated from this region will also together with genes fromthe adjacent fully characterized Xp21.1 region be evaluated for variants inpatients suffering from diabetes mellitus type I. Finally all genes from theXp11.4 region and from the proximally located regions Xp11.3 andXp11.23 can be screened for mutations in Prieto and Renpennning syn drome respectively. ,2001
1229,Most human cancers (and other complex diseases) are characterized bygenomic instability. The genetic events underlying its development arepoorly understood. In a majority of cases cancer does not occur as a sim ple mongenic disease with clear Mendelian inheritance. Results through out literature support the view of multigenic etiology for complex diseases. While the methodology for the mapping of Mendelian disorders is relative ly well developed the successful identification of genes in a complex trait is still difficult to predict. Direct application of the LD (linkage and associa tion analysis) have proven difficult for complex traits due to combinedaction of multiple genes influenced by environmental factors. The single marker LD methods cannot fully describe possible association(s) in anentire chromosomal region. To increase the statisticical power to detect thepresence of a disease locus (loci) the LD analysis can be extended fromsingle marker to multiple marker haplotypes. In general we do not have aprecise chromosomal location of the disease susceptibility locus (loci) forc ing us to search through all possible haplotypes surrounding multiple loca tions as well as spanning them. To understand and estimate structure andparameters within the genetic architecture of quantitative traits we havedeveloped a method based on fuzzy logic discovery of recurrent pattersand multilocus haplotypes and applied to the case control associationstudy for family and sporadic occurrence of the prostate cancer. Resultssuggest that combining the application of the fuzzy logic pattern recogni tion and multi markers LD methods with large numbers of (SNP) markersshould enable identification of patterns of genetics instability with potentialprognostic diagnostic and disease susceptibility loci utility. ,2001
1230,Project Description The discovery of low frequency DNA point mutations and single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) presents one of the major challenges in geneticanalysis in the post genome era. Among various techniques constant denaturant capillary electrophoresis (CDCE introduced in 1994 by Khrap ko et al.) is a viable tool for mutation detection. CDCE offers a high degreeof sensitivity as well as ability to detect low level mutations. The CDCEinstrument reported in the literature did not have any automatisation withregard to change of polymer and loading of sample. Consequently runninglarge number of samples was laborious and time consuming. The present work describes a transfer of established CDCE technology tothe multicapillary array format enabling an increase in sample throughputthat is required for large scale mutation detection and screening. In this ini tial work the main emphasis was towards the optimization of the separa tion of wildtype homoduplex and mutant homoduplex and heteroduplexesPosters: Genomics and Bioinformatics 323by determining the optimal temperature in a step wise fashion. The sepa rating conditions for the fragment were achieved with a combination ofdenaturing capacity of LPA matrix and elevated capillary temperature. Here we present data using high throughput CDCE technology to identify point mutations in exon 1 of the k ras gene. The samples analyzed were obtained from colorectal carcinoma patients previously described and ana lyzed by manual CDCE. The main objective of this study was to elucidatethe feasibility of transferring the CDCE technique from a single to multi capillary platform. In addition the detection sensitivity was measured byidentifying a number of mutants included in a wildtype population. ,2001
1231,With the increasing demand for higher throughput SNP genotyping manytechnologies have become available or are currently in the developmentpipeline. However with such large volumes of information robust datamanagement is crucial for subsequent statistical analysis. We have adopted the Perkin Elmer Wallac Victor 2V multilabel counter for a template directed dye terminator incorporation assay with fluorescencepolarization (FP TDI) detection. As there are no instrument specific appli cation notes for this SNP genotyping methodology filters and instrumentsettings had to be experimentally validated. Consequently by using a spe cific combination of filters we have observed consistent discriminationthrough a 2 dye approach with a 1 second read per well. To aid high throughput screening we have maximized the homogeneity ofthe assay by employing a standard touchdown protocol for all PCRs. Thisapproach has been designed to ensure specific and maximum PCR yieldin a limited primer and ddNTP concentration environment. In addition fol lowing the optimization with 96 well plate assays the system has beensuccessfully scaled up to a 384 well plate assay format. From the resulting data a SNP genotype can be efficiently assigned to anindividual through a graphical visualization tool that clusters the genotypes. This tool is part of a single platform with multiple views designed to handleboth SNP and microsatellite data. The data is then subjected to a set of rig orous tests including control value checks pedigree checking and ananalysis of individual/marker history to determine if conflicting genotypesexist. Based on these checks plus samples that did not yield a clear geno type a repeat plate is proposed by the system to allow minimum effort inassembly for the laboratory. Finally the data can be exported in linkage for mat for haplotype and statistical analysis. Also presented orally in Concurrent Session 5: Poster Discussion Methods to Detect Genomic V ariation ,2001
1232,The accelerating interest in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) geno typing and the sweeping pharmacogenetic implications of correlatingSNPs to phenotypes have resulted in the need for simple highly accurateSNP genotyping methods. Orchid BioSciences has developedSNPstream(TM) 5K an adaptation of Orchid s SNP IT(TM) primer exten sion genotyping assay to Luminex s novel microsphere based assay plat form. A significant benefit of the system is its ability to rapidly analyze mul tiplexed solution phase SNP IT(TM) assays. The result is highly accurateSNP genotyping system that maintains the flexibility to adapt to virtuallyany SNP loci of interest. The advantages of this microsphere based sys tem will be described along with multiplex genotyping reproducibility andaccuracy results achieved with the system.

1233,With the completion of the Human Genome Project a substantial need toobtain rapid low cost information on genetic variations has emerged. Sin gle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are being shown in ever increasingnumbers to correlate to medically relevant conditions such as adversedrug response or predisposition to disease. Understanding the correlationsbetween SNPs and phenotypes requires high throughput high density SNP detection systems enabling hundreds or thousands of SNPs per sam ple to be genotyped in a low cost robust fashion. Orchid BioSciences hasdeveloped the SNPcode(TM) system combining Orchid s SNP IT(TM)primer extension genotyping assay with the GenFlex(TM) Tag Array chipfrom Affymetrix. The result is a versatile genotyping system capable ofscoring from hundreds to thousands genotypes on a single chip. The inher ent generic design of the chip allows the user to adapt any SNP loci ofinterest to this platform. The SNPcode system utilizes a bifunctional SNP IT primer with the 3 sequence complementary to the SNP containing PCRamplicon and the 5 sequence complementary to one of the 2000 uniquetag sequences on the GenFlex chip. The assay protocol begins with multi plex PCR amplification followed by multiplexed solution phase SNP ITprimer extension. The SNP IT products are hybridized to the chip sortingthe multiplex reaction by hybridization of the specific tags on each SNP ITprimer to its unique complement on the chip. More than 1000 SNPs havebeen analyzed on the system to date. We will present use of this newgenotyping system in comparison to results collected on other genotypingplatforms. ,2001
1234,Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent powerful markers forthe mapping of genes and mutations related to important traits diseasesand for the study of pharmacogenetics. We describe our MegatypeÃ¢\x80\x9c tech nology that permits the identification of SNPs that are differentially repre sented in two populations without the need for prior knowledge of the SNPsequences. Genomic DNA fragments that exhibit a specific class of SNPsare selected using our proprietary method and loaded on to microbeadsusing our MegacloneÃ¢\x80\x9c technology as described in Brenner et al PNAS.97 1665 1670 (2000). DNA probes which reflect the allelic frequencies ofthe different SNP bearing fragments in each population are then preparedfrom the two different sample sources using the same proprietary methodand tagged with two different but complementary adapter sequences. Inorder to reduce the complexity of human probe libraries we first fractionatethe probe by using a similar but less complex library to capture relevantsequences. To increase the sensitivity of subsequent analysis competitivehybridization of the tagged probes to the target DNA on microbeads resultsin a 3 bp 3 end overhang. Ligase is added to the beads such that the twocomplementary 3 overhang sequences undergo intra bead ligation. Mole cules remaining following intra bead ligation represent the molar excess ofprobe from the sample source. The allelic frequency of these sequencescan then be measured by the addition of a pair of fluorescently labeled de coder molecules followed by analysis and sorting by flow cytometry.

1235,Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form ofvariation in the human genome and are amenable to high throughputgenotyping methods. Powerful approaches are being used to discoverhundreds of thousands of SNPs randomly distributed across the genome. Our group has taken a targeted approach in order to discover SNPs inspecific genes and genomic regions from selected individuals. The poly morphisms we discover are used as genetic markers to investigate humanhistory evolution disease and population structure. Designing an efficient high throughput system for targeted SNP discovery has held many chal lenges. These include retrieving sequences for genes of interest design ing primers for PCR amplification designing and managing a laboratoryworkflow and analyzing and interpreting the resulting data. We screenedover 2600 genes by designing primers from mRNA sequence andsequencing cDNA templates. Now that the human genome sequence isnearing completion we initiated the use of genomic DNA as the template. We adapted software to separate an mRNA sequence into exons forprimer design. We found that genomic DNA based PCR has a product 92%of the time compared to 66% for the cDNA based assay. The success ratesfor sequencing these PCR products also differ between the two methods324 Posters: Genomics and Bioinformatics(89% for DNA 70% for cDNA). Once sequencing is complete we analyze the results using the automated program Polyphred. We currently cover atleast 48Kb per person per week. Information on all aspects of our systemfrom genomic sequence through polymorphisms is entered into databasesand can be retrieved by both laboratory personnel and researcher. As of12/15/00 our lab discovered and validated over 4400 polymorphisms thathave been applied to studies on human populations and disease.

1236,An increasing number of SNP scoring methods to support associationstudies and specific genotyping panels used for phenotype prediction arebeing developed. These methods will have to meet stringent requirementsof high throughput accuracy flexibility and reduced cost. By combining aproprietary new probe labeling strategy (eTag[TM] reporters) with existing robust genotyping biochemistry such as TaqMan[R] ACLARA Biosciencesis developing a flexible multiplex assay format for multiplex SNP scoring. In the eTag label strategy each probe of a multiplexed set is labeled witha fluorogenic eTag which has a unique and characterized electrophoreticmobility. Following the reaction the cleaved eTags are separated by elec trophoresis and genotyping information is obtained by interpretation of theobtained electropherograms. Specific genotyping panels can be construct ed by selection from a library of characterized eTags. Additional eTags setscan be used as internal control markers. We are currently optimizing theSNP assay using the eTag approach for analysis on both commercial cap illary electrophoresis instrumentation (ABI 310 and ABI 3100) and our ownplastic multichannel LabCard[TM] devices. Multiplex SNP analysis of syn thetic target and genomic DNA for the cardiovascular targets LPA ApoA4 ApoB ApoE and CETP will be discussed. ,2001
1237,Genomic mismatch scanning (GMS) is a hybridization based gene map ping method which allows selective recovery of genomic DNA fragmentsthat are identical by descent (IBD) between two individuals. During GMSprocedure restriction digested genomic DNA from two subjects are dena tured mixed and allowed to reanneal to form heterohybrids. Homohybridsand mismatch containing heterohybrids are then selectively removed bytreatment with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes exonuclease and Escherichia coli mismatch repair proteins. The isolated DNA fragmentscan be then mapped to their genomic regions by genotyping withmicrosatellite markers however genomic microarrays can be used to mapIBD DNA much more efficiently. The combination of GMS and IBD mappingusing genomic microarrays is known as direct IBD mapping . To allowmapping any disease genes one needs a set of well characterizedgenomic clones. Currently in our laboratory a mapping project which willproduce a set of well characterized BAC clones covering entire humangenome at ~ 1 Mb resolution enters its final phase. Mapped BAC cloneswill be placed in map order onto a DNA microarrays. This allows easydetermination of the genomic address of DNA fragments isolated throughthe GMS procedure. Here we will discuss potential applications and exper imental specifics of direct IBD mapping. ,2001
1238,Microarray technology enables parallel measurement of thousands ofexpressed genes while minimizing sample consumption. One importantstep in the microarray process is sample preparation. Lab on a Chip tech nology provides a complete solution to improving sample preparation forDNA microarrays by identifying potential problems that may result in poorarray performance. For example RNA preparations that are degraded orcontain ribosomal RNA or genomic DNA may result in poor probe labelingand can easily be identified using the RNA6000 kit. Fluorescently labeledprobe preparations that may result in poor array performance can also bedetermined. The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer rapidly analyzes RNA prepara tions for integrity yield and genomic DNA contamination. Information withregard to amount size and the degree of purification of fluorescentlylabeled cDNA and cRNA probes can also be obtained and strongly corre lates to array performance. ,2001
1239,Gene expression arrays present unique challenges for statistical inference. The typically small number of replicated expression values in array studiesmake the use of standard parametric statistical tests problematic. Suchtests have low sensitivity and return potentially inaccurate probability val ues. We present novel alternative statistical inference procedures whichcircumvent these difficulties. The procedures stem from the concept thateach gene represents an individual experiment. Accordingly arrays pres ent large numbers of small sample experiments tested under the sameconditions. Given this it should be possible to pool the random error esti mates across all genes. We have developed two variants of the poolederror method which we refer to as common error and fitted to estimaterandom error associated with each transcript. Our pooled error methodsestimate random error from the entire array and can function with as fewas two replicates. Because our random error estimates are based on largesamples they provide more accurate and precise estimates than othermethods. With these accurate error estimates in hand classical statisticaltechniques can be applied to array analyses providing statistical tests thatare sensitive to small differences in expression. The methods will be illus trated with experimental data. ,2001
1240,"Efficient and uniform immobilisation of target DNA molecules onto a glasssurface is one of the critical steps in making DNA microarrays and is cen tral to the quality of the resulting data. We have adopted and comparedimmobilisation of amino modified DNA onto a poly L lysine and 3 glyci doxypropyltrimethoxysilane modified glass surfaces disulphide modifiedDNA onto a 3 mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane modified glass surface anda disulphide modified DNA covalently cross linked to 3 mercaptopropy ltrimethoxysilane onto unmodified glass surface. Individual chemistrieswere tested with Cy5 and Cy3 labelled PCR products or Cy5 labelledoligonucleotides. Target DNA was spotted by GeneSurfer arrayer(GeneAge Technologies) and individual reaction steps were followed byIVL laser scanner (Genomic Solution). Our experience showed that pub lished immobilisation protocols were usable only after careful optimisation. Poly L lysine chemistry is useful for binding of amino modified and even ofnon modified DNA. However blocking procedure limits its application onlyfor hybridisation experiment. Disulphide chemistry is applicable for bothhybridisation and primer extension experiments. Procedure is fast effec tive and cheap what makes it preferable for high throughput array produc tion. Posters: Genomics and Bioinformatics 325P1152. Improved background correction for spotted DNA microarrays C. Kooperberg Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Seattle WA United S', 'Most microarray scanning software for glass spotted arrays provides esti mates for the intensity for the foreground and background of two chan nels for every spot. The common approach in further analyzing such datais to first subtract the background from the foreground for each channel and to use the ratio of these two results as the estimate of the expressionlevel. The resulting ratios are after possible averaging over replicates theusual inputs for further data analysis such as clustering. If with this back ground correction procedure the foreground intensity was smaller than thebackground intensity for a channel that spot (on that array) yields nousable data. In this paper it is argued that this preprocessing leads to esti mates of the expression that have a much larger variance than neededwhen the expression levels are low. ",2001

Of great interesthas been acquired genetic disorders due to exposure of humans livingaround uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. There has been much atten tion given to the exposure problem in the United states [( Agency for ToxicSubstances and Disease Registries (ATSDR) Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) National Research Council (NRC)] and to serious environ mental cleanup efforts (Superfund Sites). Popular Superfund sites haveincluded Love Canal New Y ork W oburn Massachusetts Hinckley California and Toms River New Jersey.

1242,An exciting promise of pharmacogenomics research is to develop genetests that will predict which individuals are at increased risk of side effectsand which individuals will benefit most from each specific drug. Associationstudies are often used. A target group is selected (eg those with abnormaldrug clearance and/ or side effects) and they are compared with a controlgroup with no side effects or normal clearance. We discuss the issuesrelating to selecting these groups and what sample size is required. It isimportant to know the population distribution of the polymorphisms beingstudied and if possible select the control group from this population so thedesign becomes a nested case control study. This allows true estimates ofthe risks for target group for each allele type. The presentation will discussvarious methods for adjusting for population admixture such as matchingcase and control or alternatively using family based studies such as theTDT test. Once a suspected polymorphism is identified there needs to becollaborative studies to verify the findings. An alternative is to examine ifthe polymorphism found to be important actually affects gene function. Wehave developed an in vitro method of inserting a particular single basechange into a gene and studying the change in function using an attachedreporter molecule ,2001
1243,Down syndrome (DS) or Trisomy 21 is the most common genetic cause ofmental retardation occuring in approximately 1/700 live births. In addition there are other neurological phenotypes associated with DS includingbrachycephaly microcephaly and early onset Alzheimer s like desease. The presence of an extra copy of certain but not all of the approximately250 genes on HC21 is likely to contribute to the DS phenotype. However the effect of each of these gene products to the specific phenotypes couldbe either direct of indirect through processes that affect the expression ofother genes or gene products. This hypothesis leads to the need for theexploration of global gene expression studies in cells and tissues from indi viduals with DS and from model organisms (see also Chrast et al. thismeeting). Our aim is to use techniques available for measuring global geneexpression (SAGE macroarrays and microarrays) to analyse the differ ences in gene expression in aneuploid versus normal mammalian braincells to identify genes and pathways with altered expression levels in DSphenotypes. Here we describe results using large nylon macroarrays thatcontain over 30 000 human genes to analyse gene expression differencesbetween DS versus normal human fetal brain at 20 weeks of gestation. Wehave identified a number of genes which show consistent changes withindifferent DS and normal samples and are confirming these changes byNorthern blot and RNase protection. Comparison of data from human andmouse models of DS as well as data from different techniques (SAGE) will enable us to identify the most important genes and pathways involvedin the DS neurological phenotype. ,2001
1244,We have developed a new practical application for comparative DNAsequencing analysis. The focus of this new application is the discovery oridentification of sequence variants in a data set of sequence derived froma single locus in various individuals. This tool allows for the rapid and accu rate analysis and alignment of multiple sequence comparisons containingmixed base positions against a reference sequence. This application usesprocedures and algorithms better suited to the unique nature of compara tive sequencing data. Specifically the prior knowledge of a referencesequence available in many comparative sequencing projects is used tostreamline and automate portions of the analysis. In addition new algo rithms were developed that leverage the high degree of sequence similar ity found in comparative sequencing applications to aid in the analysis. The326 Posters: Genomics and Bioinformaticssoftware performs sequence analysis and aligns the analyzed sequence to a reference sequence. It also aligns imported sequences that contain vari ants. It will then analyze the compared sequences provide protein trans lation and report the analysis in a convenient format. Here we present theresults from the performance evaluation of this new software tool on sev eral types of comparative sequencing data sets. For these analyses thisnew application produced results concordant with those previouslyobtained using standard DNA analysis tools while providing substantialperformance advantages over these tools. In all cases the analyses werecompleted in significantly less time and required less manual manipulationof the data. The innovative approaches employed in this tool result in lessuser intervention needed to achieve improved mutation detection. ,2001
1245,We constructed a high resolution physical map of the human genomeincluding markers and genes using a method that integrates data from dif ferent sources. We store the data in relational databases (Oracle andAccess) and use queries that process and analyze the data to constructphysical maps integrating all available information. We integrated datagenerated in our group with data from the public domain. We used the fin gerprinting contig database from Washington University and the SangerCenter and the Human Genome Project Working Draft sequence from theUniversity of California at Santa Cruz. We generated hybridization datawith 8.040 microsatellite markers versus BACs from the RPCI 11 library. Electronic PCR versus the human genome draft sequence was performedwith approximately 1 000.000 markers designed from BAC endsequences known STSs gene Reference Sequences UniGene clustersand sequences contained in one Affymetrix expression chip. Positional dis crepancies from different sources were analyzed and a final location wasprovided to the markers. The integrated physical map includes physicallocations for 9.446 microsatellite markers 9.127 gene ReferenceSequences 9.147 Affymetryx expression chip sequences and 17.380markers from UniGene EST clusters. The high degree of automation of theprocess allow us to rapidly update and construct a human genome physi cal map with new information on a monthly basis. ,2001
1246,The X chromosome is one of the best characterized human chromosomes. Most genes on the X chromosome display a haploid status in males andas a consequence recessive mutations in X linked disease genes result inhemizygous affected males and heterozygous (usually asymptomatic) car rier females. The easily recognizable inheritance pattern of X linked dis eases allows instant assignment of the causative genes to the X chromo some. For these reasons genetic analysis and mapping of genes on the Xchromosome have been greatly facilitated. It is estimated that the X chro mosome contains 1.500 4 000 genes but only 446 UniGene cluster(December 2000 version) have been assigned to the chromosome so far. By the analysis of the working draft sequence of the human X chromosomewe will assemble a close to complete X chromosome gene collection. Sofar we identified 1500 X linked UniGene cluster. The majority of clustersare aligned to the sequence of the goldenpath (http //genome.ucsc.edu/).A set of two IMAGE clones per cluster were identified and re arrayed. Thisarray will greatly accelerate physical mapping and candidate geneapproaches aiming in identifying disease causing mutations. In order toidentify transcripts not covered by UniGene clusters we used gene predic tion methods for generation of hypothetical cDNA and peptide sequences. These in silico gene targets are evaluated in a second step by doingsequence comparisons against all available mammalian Unigene sets Protein databases and model organisms including non public EST data bases generated at MPIMG. Potential novel gene targets are classifiedthen by low or no detectable homology to any of the human databases. Outof these only the predictions with several exons and a minimum cDNAlength of more than 500 bp were initially considered for further analysis. The analysis of the genomic sequence of the human X chromosome result ed in a set of 700 novel gene candidates where no significant sequencehomology to the human Unigene set could be detected and which fulfilled the arguments mentioned above. These candidates are presently underinvestigation. Results are stored in The Integrated X chromosome Database (IXDB http //ixdb.molgen.mpg.de/). In addition to our own mapping and in silicodata IXDB integrates data from other public databases as well as data fromthe EC Transcript Map Consortium. Nine chromosome spanning andeleven contig maps can be viewed. ,2001
1247,Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones carry large insert (80 300kb) and are used by large genome centers and small laboratories. HumanGenome Project and other research projects have generated extensivemaps sequences annotation and function information for many BACs. The data are extremely valuable. However currently different pieces ofinformation are scattered over different places and an integration of theexisting data for each BAC is lacking. Researchers have to spend signifi cant amount of time searching for information of the BACs that they areinterested in and often are unable to obtain a complete picture that some times results in duplication of efforts. Although a few sites start to offer amore complete set of data for human BACs these resources are aimed tofacilitate the collaboration among genome centers to finish the humangenome and therefore are not easy to use by the general research com munity. In order to utilize the massive data efficiently and to realize the ulti mate goals of the genome projects a centralized place that gathers inte grates and makes the data easily accessible is greatly needed. Towardsthis end we build a comprehensive BAC resource for species includinghuman mouse rat and zebrafish. The current database contains over630 000 human BACs and 265 000 mouse BACs that are mapped with23 000 human clones and 1 000 mouse clones having sequences andannotation. The database is freely accessible via the web and supportssequence or clone searches and anonymous FTP. The relevant sites andresources are described athttp //www.tigr.org/tdb/BacResource/BAC_resource_intro.html. ,2001
1248,We are generating a repository of mapped bacterial artificial chromosome(BAC) clones that covers the human genome at a resolution of ~ 1 Mb. These clones are designed as reagents for microarray based gene map ping and Direct Identical by descent Mapping . They can also be used toidentify and characterize chromosomal abnormalities. The BAC clonesfrom the Roswell Park Cancer Institute human male BAC library (RP II)have been mapped to radiation hybrid (RH) markers by filter hybridizationand PCR. The clones are characterized by HindIII fingerprinting endsequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization . These characterizedclones allow us to integrate the RH map with cytogenetic map and thehuman genome sequence. Currently we have over 3 000 mapped BACclones and characterization is near completion. A database GenMapDB http //genomics.med.upenn.edu/genmapdb has been developed to pro vide information on these mapped clones as well as to consolidate multi ple resources related to this project. In this presentation we will discussthe content of this clone collection and illustrate its use in genome analy sis. ,2001
1249,The aim of our project is to establish a fully annotated physical DNAsequence and gene map of human chromosome 7. As part of this anno tation we are also collecting and characterizing all clinical functional andbiological information relevant to chromosome 7. Through analysis of DNAsequence data in the public and Celera databases we could detect corre sponding genomic fragments for over 98% (6 500 of 6 579) of the STSsknown to map to chromosome 7. Initially 70 large (>500 kb) DNAPosters: Genomics and Bioinformatics 327sequence contigs could be established with the average length being 1.6 Mb and the largest being 11.5 Mb. To complete the map of chromosome 7we have determined the end sequence of 200 cosmid or BAC clones andgenerated over 700 kb of genomic DNA sequence resulting in coverage orclosure of 16 gaps. Our analysis indicate most of the euchromatic regionis now covered but that the pericentromeric region is still under represent ed requiring additional mapping and sequencing work. Moreover a 100 200 kb duplication at 7p11.1 was identified to be present in 30 copies else where in the genome and another 200 kb segment was found in 3 4 copiesat 7q11.23 further complicating assemblies. With the current DNAsequence map we have so far identified over 718 full length genes and1382 additional transcriptional units (total of 2100) on chromosome 7. Also 100 rearrangement breakpoints 700 FISH mapped clones 3 fragile sites and 3 imprinted regions could be accurately placed on the DNA sequence based map for future disease gene research. ,2001
1250,Chromosome 21 is the smallest human autosome and an additional copycauses Down syndrome the most frequent genetic disorder of mentaldegradation in humans. The complete DNA sequence was publishedrecently leading to 127 known as well as 98 predicted genes. Based onthe complete chromosomal DNA sequence we have computationallydesigned specific oligonucleotides for all known predicted as well morethan 275 possible gene transcripts which had been annotated using theAnnotation EngineTM module of our BioGISTTM software package. Forevery gene transcript three different oligonucleotides were robotically spot ted (Affymetrix 417 arrayer) onto glass slides. Those microarrays werehybridized with fluorescent labeled cDNA derived from lymphoblastoid celllines of two patients suffering from Down syndrome as well as healthy con trols. Gene transcripts were regarded to be present if two of three oligonu cleotides showed significant values above background. Also variations inthe mRMA amount between patients and controls were monitored and dataobtained from these experiments will be presented. Because of the recent ly published DNA sequence cDNA clones of many known predicted aswell as possible genes are not available. HPSF oligonucleotide microar rays therefore provides a valuable tool for first phase expression analysisof genes not known to be expressed so far. ,2001
1251,Pyrosequencing is a non electrophoretic DNA sequencing method basedon the detection of pyrophosphate released as a result of nucleotide incor poration by DNA polymerase. An enzyme cascade converts the pyrophos phate to light which is detected by the camera in a PSQÃ¢\x80\x9c96 System(Pyrosequencing AB). The system includes a PSQÃ¢\x80\x9c96 instrument with dedicated software and reagent kits for the application. Each reagent kitcontains the enzyme and substrate mixtures and the four nucleotide solu tions ready for use. Sequence stretches of some 20 bases can be used toidentify specific genes or genomes. Such stretches are known as Signa ture Tags . PyrosequencingÃ¢\x80\x9c technology has now been adapted to enablethe reading of these signature tag sequences. The components of a newreagent kit allow parallel processing of up to 96 samples within approxi mately one hour. Samples are easily prepared from PCR products. As thefour nucleotides are added sequentially to the reaction mixture thesequence of an unknown sample is easily determined from the developingpyrogramÃ¢\x80\x9c in which peaks are generated as nucleotides are incorporat ed. A dedicated algorithm for automatic base calling and quality assess ment from PyrosequencingÃ¢\x80\x9c data has been developed. The results are stored in a local database fully traceable and easily editable if desired. Onaverage over 20 bases were correctly sequenced on a number of tem plates differing in origin GC content and length. The suitability of Pyrose quencingÃ¢\x80\x9c technology for Signature Tag sequencing was clearly demon strated. ,2001
1252,The euchromatic sequences of chromosomes 21 and 22 are almost com plete and have similar lengths (33.7 34.6 Mb). This similarity largely con trols for the influence of sequence length making comparison of patterns ofrecombination and chiasma interference interesting. There are marked dif ferences between the two chromosomes in both of these aspects. Overallchromosome 21 shows less recombination particularly in males thanchromosome 22 (56 versus 71 cM). The level of chiasma interference israther close to the genome average of p=0.35 (in the Rao et al. mappingfunction) for both sexes for chromosome 22 and for female chromosome21. However the paternal chromosome 21 level is p=0.05. This indicatesvery strong chiasma interference. We suggest that these differencesdepend on the very different sequence composition of the two chromo somes particularly in the distribution of GT/CA repeats and/or tetranu cleotides. We observe that recombination in males is significantly associ ated with these repeat tracts. For chromosome 21 the longer repeat tractsare localised to the sub telomeric region only but they are more wide spread on 22. This suggests there may be fewer opportunities for doublerecombination events to occur within a critical distance for chromosome21 consistent with higher levels of interference. The sex difference may berelated to the greater condensation of chromosomes in paternal meiosis which restricts recombination to areas with the longer repeat tracts. ,2001
1253,The present work is focused on the exploration of domain organization ofa specific region within human chromosome 16q22.1 containing a tightcluster of genes the LCAT gene cluster. We suggest that the organizationof the gene cluster has biological significance. We have recently generat ed a high resolution integrated map covering 2.8 Mb surrounding the LCATgene cluster (Frengen E. Rocca Serra P. Shaposhnikov S. et al. Genomics 70(3) in press 2000). This map includes a candidate region forcontaining a putative tumor supressor gene. The approach used in thepresent work is based on the ability of cellular topoisomerase II to cleaveDNA in the presence of several anticancer agents. The cleavage sites areassociated with regions of DNA attachment to the nuclear skeleton andindicate DNA loop anchorage sites. Thus verifying the topoisomerase IIcleavage sites within the region allow mapping of the domain organization. Human cells have been exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitor the DNAfrom the cells was cleaved with restriction enzymes separated by pulsedfield gel electrophoresis blotted and hybridized with probes from theLCAT gene cluster region. The domain maps allow relation of the structur al architecture of the region to the functional organization of the DNA. ,2001
1254,DASH is a method for high throughput genotyping of SNPs insertion/dele tions (indels) and other sequence variations (Genome Res 2001 11 152 162 Nature Biotech 1999 17 87 88). Allele discrimination is based uponreal time detection of hybridisation stability differences in duplex DNAsinvolving fully matched or allelic mismatched structures. The publishedprocedure involves PCR amplification of a target sequence (with oneprimer biotinylated) streptavidin affinity capture of one product strand hybridisation of an unlabelled oligonucleotide probe (matching one allele)at low temperature in the presence of a double strand specific fluorescentdye and steady heating through a temperature range while monitoring flu orescence. Changes in the amount of duplexed probe target material arethereby tracked as a melting curve profile indicating whether the probe target duplexes were perfectly matched subtly mismatched or a het erozygous mixture of the two. A validation study was performed involvingapplication of DASH to 89 randomly selected proven SNPs. Non optimizedassay designs (worst case scenario) resulted in 79 functional assays(89%). Secondary structures in target sequences were found to be criti cally harmful to DASH performance. Identifying and altering key PCRprimer bases involved in secondary structure formation can overcome this328 Posters: Genomics and Bioinformaticsproblem. This led to an improved design success rate of essentially 100% (6/6 initially non functioning DASH assays were restored via this optimizeddesign strategy). A software tool for automated DASH assay design thatincorporates the new design system has now been developed. Subse quent DASH studies demonstrated that the method provides genotypingaccuracy >99.9% and a reproducibility of 100%. With the above DASHsystem an individual worker can easily genotype several thousand sam ples/week. To move towards genotyping hundreds of thousands of samples we areexploring many new DASH modifications. Reaction principles are now inplace for scaling up via i) micro volume (<2?L) PCR in 1536 well plates ii)employing liquid handling free spun arrays for DASH execution on flat sur faces and iii) incorporating multiplexed potential by using FRET based sig nal production. Final imaging of DASH melting curves will employ a CCDcamera. We anticipate that a fully validated system along these lines willbe produced this year.

1255, hop paris.frIn two related galactosaemic patients from an Ashkenazi jewish family noPCR amplification of the 11 exons of the uridyltransferase gene (galt) waspossible. A homozygote Galt gene deletion was then suspected. Success ful co amplification by duplex PCR of another gene eliminated the hypoth esis of PCR inhibitors. Sequencing of the 11 exons in the parents did notreveal any heterozygote mutation or polymorphism and suggested a het erozygote deletion in both parents. To confirm the possible deletion realtime quantitative PCR on a LightCycler system was used. The Galt geneand as reference internal control the superoxyde dismutase (SOD) genewere co amplified in the same tube by duplex PCR in DNA from patients parents and controls they were compared to a range of serial DNA dilu tions for quantitation. The two genes were submitted to the same PCR fluc tuations since they were amplified in the same reaction. The copy numberof Galt gene was about twofold lower in each parent s DNA (ratioGalt/SOD=0.43 and 0.47 for mother and father respectively) than in con trol DNA (ratio=1.2+/ 0.2) thus confirming the heterozygous status for thedeletion. The quantitative real time PCR by duplex PCR in a single tube ongenomic DNA represents an interesting alternative to time consuming andlabor intensive Southern blotting or pulsed field gel electrophoresis for thediagnosis of deletions especially in heterozygous patients. CompleteGALT gene deletion is rare and was only described previously in two otherunrelated Ashkenazi jewish families. ,2001
1256,We describe a novel homozygous PHKG2 mutation in a boy with liver Phkdeficiency who developed cirrhosis early in infancy. A 9 year old boy thesecond child of healthy consanguineous Pakistani parents presented at16 months with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Blood tests showed liver cellnecrosis cholestasis severe hypocalcaemia and microcytic hypocromicanaemia. Ultrasonography showed an enlarged and homogeneouslyhyperecogenic liver. A liver biopsy revealed severe fibrosis hepaticdebranching and phosphorylase enzyme activities were normal whilephosphorylase kinase activity was undetectable The clinical follow up ofthe child showed persistent alteration of function liver tests with a normalglucose control and a correct diet treatment. A second liver biopsy per formed at the age of 8 years showed liver cirrhosis. Direct sequencing ofthe PHKG2 gene revealed a single homozygous T to C mutation atnucleotide position 1122 in exon 10 replacing an encoded leucine withproline at codon 357 (L357P). This mutation segregates with the biochem ical phenotype and it was not found by us in 50 normal controls. Thesedata enlarge the spectrum of mutations associated with PhKG2 gene andfurther confirms that PhK deficient liver glycogenosis associated with cir rhosys is caused by PHKG2 mutations. ,2001
1257,Mutations in the glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase) gene are responsiblefor glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa). It is characterized by growthretardation hepatomegaly hypoglicemia hyperlipidemia and lactic acido sis. In this study we are reporting G6PC gene mutations in eight of thetwenty five Brazilian patients with clinical symptoms of GSDIa . Five previ ously described mutations (R83C Q347X V338F D38V and G68R) weredetected. The two most common mutations identified were R83C andQ347X accounting for 8 out of 14 (57 14%) mutant alleles. It was also ana lyzed the 1176 polymorphism and two intronic mutations (IVS3 58T>A andIVS4+10G>A). We used the minigenes strategy in order to verify the effectof this intronic mutations in the splice mechanism. This study underscoresthat molecular genetic analysis is a reliable and convenient alternative tothe enzyme assay in a fresh liver biopsy specimen to diagnose GSDIa. ,2001
1258, saude.ptGlycogen Storage Disease Type Ia (von Gierke disease GSD Ia MIM#232200) is an autossomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a defi cient activity of the catalytic unit of the microssomal glucose 6 phos phatase (G6Pase) system. Since the characterisation of the G6Pase cat alytic unit gene a steadily growing number of mutations responsible forGSD Ia have been reported. The identification of mutations allows a non invasive DNA based method for the diagnosis of patients suspected ofhaving GSD Ia but has also important implications with respect to carrierdetection and prenatal diagnosis. Here we describe a new mutation inintron four of the G6Pase gene that cause a change in the acceptor sitefor splicing. This mutation IVS4 3C>G was found in five Portuguesepatients with a previous enzymatic diagnosis of GSD Ia (three homozy gous and two heterozygous) and was absent from the 228 control allelestested. Due to the unavailability of liver biopsy from any of these patients it was not possible to confirm the presence of the aberrant mRNA. In spiteof this limitation there are some reasons that strongly suggest that thismutation cause an aberrant splicing of the G6Pase gene leading to animpaired activity of the G6Pase (i) the nature of the substitution (only 1%of the acceptor splicing sites have a guanine at that position) (ii) the fre quency of this mutation among Portuguese patients (17% of the alleles) (iii) the absence of any other mutation in the G6Pase gene of the homozy gous patients and (iiii) the absence from the control alleles. ,2001
1259,Clinical symptoms in patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies arevery heterogeneous. Oxidative phosphorylation system as the only excep tion in mammalian cell is encoded by both the nuclear DNA (nDNA) andthe mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The presence of homogeneous popula tion of mtDNA molecules in tissue is called homoplasmy the presence ofwild type and mutated mtDNA molecules is known as heteroplasmy. Clini cal manifestation of mtDNA mutations occurs when the percentage ofmutated mtDNA copies reaches a threshold value when the cell is nomore able to tolerate the mutation and decrease in activity of several com plexes of respiratory chain cause insufficient energy provision. In this studywe analysed tissue specific distribution of mtDNA mutation A3243G andmtDNA mutation A8344G in blood muscles hair roots and skin fibroblastsfrom 26 patients in 10 families with MELAS and MERRF syndrome. Inpatients with syndrome MERRF and MELAS the level of heteroplasmyvaried between 6% and 95%. The range of heteroplasmy of mtDNA muta tions in various tissues in one patient was quite broad (from 48% to 95%).The highest heteroplasmy was found in muscles followed on with hairroots. Low levels of mutated mtDNA molecules were found in blood andfibroblasts. In most of investigated families the portion of mutated mtDNAmolecules increase in descendant generations the increase wasnÃÂ«t thesame in all studied tissues. Supported by GACR 302/99/0648. ,2001

1261,A human mitochondrial suspension isolated from HepG2 culture wasmicroinjected into fertilized eggs of CBAÃÂ«C57BL mice. In the first experi mental series the microinjected zygotes were cultured in vitro to the blas tocyst stage. All embryos survived and developed normally. Previously species specific primers were designed for the human mtDNA and theendogenous mt DNA in the embryos. An Alu1 cleavage site was found inthe human mtDNA sequence which is absent from the murine mtDNA. Thisallowed us to discriminate the amplified human mtDNA from that of themouse. A presence of human mtDNA was shown by PCR with species specific primers at every stage of development of the preimplantationembryos. Then 2 and 4 cell embryos derived from microinjection zygoteswere separated to blastomeres. More than once human mtDNA wasrevealed only in one blastomere after the first cleavage of a zygote. Insome cases one blastomere of the 4 cell embryo carried no human mate rial and another showed the presence of somewhat lower amount ofhuman mtDNA. In all cases when microinjected zygotes reached the blas tocyst stage human mtDNA was detected. In the second experiments themicroinjected zygotes were transplanted into the uteri of recipient mice. DNA of foreign mitochondria was found by PCR with species specificprimers in the embryos at 8th 13th days of embryogenesis. The per centof transgenic embryos was 13%. The several 13th days embryos weredivided to different tissues and organs which further were analyzed sepa rately for presence of human mtDNA. Heteroplasmic mice produced by thistechnique will be useful in study of mitochondrial dynamics and may has ten the creation of animal models of human mt DNA based diseases. ,2001
1262,Hereditary phosphofructokinase deficiency or T arui s di sease is an autoso mal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of phosphofructokinase(PFK) enzyme which catalyzes the ATP dependent conversion of fructose6 phosphate to fructose 1 6 biphosphate. Three isoenzymes of PFK havebeen identified namely muscle (M) liver (L) and platelet (P). The PFK Mgene responsible for this disorder spans 30 kb and consists of 24 exonsencoding three types of tissue specific mRNA variants. We report the330 Posters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic Diseasemolecular characterization of a 20 year old Chinese male with PFK M defi ciency. The proband an offspring from a consanguineous marriage pre sented with exercise intolerance and compensated hemolysis. The genet ic defect was identified through RT PCR and sequencing analysis ofmRNA transcripts. A single nucleotide substitution involving a C to T tran sition was identified in exon 6 of the PFK M gene. The proband washomozygous for this mutation while the parents were observed to be het erozygous carriers. This mutation generated a stop codon predicted toresult in premature termination of translation of the PFK enzyme. This isthe first PFK M mutation known to us to be reported in an ethnic Chinesepatient. ,2001
1263,We describe a case of a fatal infantile storage disease withhepatosplenomegaly and severe neurological disease caused by a defi ciency of prosaposin precursor protein giving rise to saposins A B C andD. Saposins are essential for in vivo activation of lysosomal hydrolasestaking part in the sphingolipid degradation cascade. The patient washomozygous for 1bp deletion in saposin B domain (c803delG) leading toa frameshift and premature stop codon. In obligatory heterozygotes themutant mRNA was detectable only in nuclear RNA fraction of skin fibrob last while in cytosolic RNA fraction it was undetectable presumably due tononsense mediated mRNA decay. Degradation of majority of the mutantmRNA may lead to functional deficit of saposin A in spite of normal sap Adomain coding sequence. The absence of immunodetectable saposins(saposins A D) in patientÃÂ«s tissues was accomompanied by a broad spectrum of stored sphingolipids encompassing ceramide mono di tri tetra hexosides and sulphatide ceramides. In heterozygous parents directsequencing of RT PCR products revealed only wild type cDNA sequence suggesting that mutant mRNA was significantly less abundant. MutantcDNA was detected by ARMS only in RNA isolated from nuclear fraction ofparents fibroblasts it was not detectable in cytoplasmic fraction. This con firms that mutant mRNA is in cytoplasm essentially absent or at least sig nificantly less abundant. These findings together with the lack ofimmunoreactive saposins A D in the patient s tissues allow to postulatethat the c803delG in addition to deficit of saposins B C and D leads tofunctional deficit of saposin A due to nonsense mediated decay. ,2001
1264,Lysosomal membrane transport proteins mediate the traffic of protons cysteine or activated acetyl residues into the lysosome and the catabolicproducts such as amino acids monosaccharides and vitamins out of thelysosome. Lack or malfunction of lysosomal transporter proteins causesseveral severe genetic diseases of children including nephropathic cysti nosis CTNS) Niemann Pick disease type C sialic acid storage disease(SIASD) cobalamin (cbl) F disease mucolipidosis IV (ML IV) and Sanfilip po III type C (MPS IIIC). The goal of our proteomic based research pro gram is to identify the underlying cause of genetic diseases as reflectedby the protein patterns of affected cells and tissues. We have isolated lyso somal membranes from mouse and human liver obtained their proteomicmaps using two dimensional gel electrophoresis with immobilized pH gra dients and identified the major proteins by combining peptide mass finger printing and amino acid sequencing. The obtained results have providedthe basis to build a complete proteomic database of the lysosomal mem brane. Then we have analyzed lysosomal membrane proteins from cul tured skin fibroblasts of normal controls and patients suffering from cbl Fand MPS IIIC and identified the protein spots that reproducibly differbetween patients and control cells. Candidate disease causing genes willbe cloned and studied by mutation analysis and/or by expression andfunctional characterization. This approach may be in the future extended todiscovery of other disease related membrane proteins in peroxisomes microsomes mitochondria and the plasma membranes. ,2001
1265,There have been several reports of adult patients with Gaucher disease the inherited deficiency of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GC) who havedeveloped parkinsonian symptoms. We have observed that these patientsgenerally have relatively mild visceral manifestations of Gaucher disease but develop an early onset treatment refractory form of Parkinson s. Weperformed genotypic analyses of 9 adult patients with type 1 Gaucher dis ease and parkinsonian manifestations. The patients were from 8 differentnations and included Ashkenazi and non Jewish individuals. Directsequencing of the 11 exonic regions of the GC gene demonstrated that notwo patients shared the same genotype. The common N370S mutation which was heretofore not associated with neuronopathic Gaucher disease was encountered in 7 of the patients studied. One patient carried mutationL444P on the paternal allele and D409H on the maternal allele but South ern blot analyses showed that the maternal allele had an additional 15 kbfragment resulting from a recombination between metaxin and its pseudo gene. Metaxin a convergently transcribed gene located adjacent to the GCpseudogene encodes for a 317 aa protein which is part of a preproteinimport complex in the outer membrane of the mammalian mitochondrion. Sequencing of the gene for metaxin along with the genes for parkin andalpha synuclein is in progress for all of the 9 patients. Because Parkinson s disease is a relatively common disorder thought to result from multiple eti ologies there also may be different genes contributing to this phenotypeamong our patients. Further analyses of the glucocerebrosidase locus inthese patients are also being performed to explore the possible associa tion of the parkinsonian symptoms and alterations in genes contiguous toglucocerebrosidase. ,2001
1266,Gaucher disease is the most frequent sphingolipidosis. It is caused bylysosomal b glucocerebosidase (GCD) deficiency or rarely by the deficien cy of sphingolipid activator protein saposin C. More than 120 mutationswere described in the human b glucocerebrosidase gene in Gaucherpatients. (1) The majority of GCD deficient Gaucher patients are com pound heterozygotes. In non Jewish populations rare or private mutationsform about 25 30 % of mutant alleles. (2) Therefore functional expressionof mutant GCD is necessary to distinguish neutral mutations from deleteri ous mutations. We have used hybrid vaccinia expression system to studywild type and mutant GCD. We have expressed novel and rare mutationsfound in Czech Gaucher patients. (3) The individual mutations were intro duced by site directed mutagenesis into expression vector pTM1 glu1 which contains human GCD cDNA under control of T7 promoter. (4 5) Wehave constructed five recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying wild type andmutant human GCDs. The tissue culture cell line was co infected withVTF7 3 vaccinia virus which expresses T7 RNA polymerase and witheach of the recombinant viruses. High levels of GCD expression wereachieved. Plasmids carrying mutant 15 different GCD cDNAs wereemployed also for transient expression of GCD. In spite of the rather highbackground of tissue culture cell lines it was possible to distinguish poly morphisms and deleterious mutations in both cases.

1267,"Gaucher disease is the most common glycolipid storage disorder known. The disease is characterized by glucocerebrosidase deficiency caused bymutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. Enzyme deficiencyresults in accumulation of glucocerebroside within the reticuloendothelialPosters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic Disease 331system which may lead to hepatosplenomegaly bone marrow suppres sion and bone lesions. The disease is panethnic and has been divided intothree clinical phenotypes (Types I III) with Type I being most common. Inthe Ashkenazi Jewish population Type I disease frequency is estimated to1 in 500 with a carrier rate to approximate 1 in 10. Enzyme replacementtherapy is available for Type I Gaucher disease resulting in clinicalimprovement and increased quality of live. Since the sequence of the GBAgene was first published in 1985 more than 100 mutations have beendescribed. We have developed a reverse hybridization assay for the rapidand simultaneous detection of six mutations predominantly found in theJewish population 84GG IVS2(+1) 1226G 1297T 1448C and 1604A. The test is based on a single multiplex DNA amplification reaction andready to use test strips presenting a parallel array of oligonucleotideprobes for each wild type and mutated allele. The entire procedure fromblood sampling to the identification of GBA mutations needs less than 6hours and may be automated on existing equipment (e.g. TECAN profi Blot). (', ') ",2001
1268,Biochemical diagnosis of Gaucher disease in Romanian populationbecame available since 1997. In this study we measured the enzymaticactivities of acid beta glucosidase in peripheral blood leukocytes and ofserum chitotriosidase in 68 suspects selected according to clinical andhistopathological criteria. 22 type 1 Gaucher disease patients were con firmed. Analysis of the frequent mutations in the acid beta glucosidasegene N370S L444P R463C 84GG and of the recombinant alleles recN ci I and recTL was performed by PCR RFLP and by sequencing of theamplified fragments bearing the L444P substitution respectively. Clinicalseverity was evaluated according to the Zimran severity score index. Theresults obtained indicate a high prevalence of the N370S allele (52.3%) followed by the L444P (22.7%) recNci I (6.8%) alleles and unknown muta tions (18.2%). Genotype phenotype correlations were similar to thosereported for other Caucasian populations with the N370S allele excludingthe development of neurological symptoms and the L444P allele indicatinga more severe course of the disease. This study indicates a high preva lence of type 1 Gaucher disease in Romanian population (22 confirmedpatients in only 4 years of biochemical diagnosis) and points out to thenecessity of introduction of the enzyme replacement therapy in Romania. ,2001
1269,The lysosomal storage disorder GM1 gangliosisdosis is a genetic meta bolic and neurological disorder caused by a complete or partial deficiencyof the enzyme acid b galactosidase. Infantile GM1 gangliosisdosis is rela tively common in the Maltese population with a heterozygous frequencyof 3.0%. The mutations responsible were studied in five unrelated Maltesefamilies. Fragments containing all the exons and flanking regions of the ÃÂ§ galactosidase gene where amplified using the polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and were either sequenced directly or scanned by single strandedconformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis prior to sequencing. A dou ble point mutation CG? AT within the IVS 7 of the ÃÂ§ galactosidase gene at position 9 and 10 bp downstream of the 3 end of exon7 was identifiedin all the families studied and denoted as Spl7. Another mutation denotedas IVS14 nt Ã¢\x80\x942G an A? G transition located at the invariant AG dinucleotide of the 3 splice acceptor site of intron 14 has also been characterized inthree of the families. The IVS14 nt Ã¢\x80\x942G mutation was identified in patientswho were also shown to be carriers of the Spl7 mutation. The R482H muta tion has been identified in two of the families. A single nucleotide poly morphism IVS7 +10G>T (the G? T transversion in mutation Spl7) whichhas an allelic frequency of 1 in 16 in the Maltese population has also beencharacterised. In conclusion these data indicate that the Spl 7 andIVS14nt 2G mutations are probably linked and show considerable molec ular heterogeneity in the ÃÂ§ galactosidase gene of Maltese patients withGM1 gangliosidosis. ,2001
1270,Type I GM1 Gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by thedeficiency of beta galactosidase. The accumulation of GM1 gangliosidecauses neurological regression and death within the first two years of life. Its incidence (1 200 000 world wide) is highly increased in South Brazil(1 17 000 live births) where only two mutations (R59H and 1627insG) areresponsible for almost 60% of the alleles. We studied a group of 390 nor mal individuals in order to determine the frequency of carriers in the gen eral population. In addition to identify a possible common origin to thesemutations 26 patients and the controls were analysed for the presence oftwo polymorphisms (R521C and S532G). All patients were diagnosed byenzyme assay on plasma or leukocytes. Parents were also analysed toestablish linkage phase. Mutation analysis in 24 new patients confirmedthe frequencies of R59H (21%) and 1627insG (37%) assigned in 20 casespreviously analysed. Mutation frequency in the controls was 0 13% and0 38% respectively. Therefore carrier proportion is 1 65 similar to thatfound in PKU. The frequency of the polymorphisms R521C and S532Gwas 0% and 18% in the patients and 3% and 7% in the controls. Haplotypeanalysis indicated a possible common origin for R59H found to be linkedto the G allele for S532G in two thirds of the patients. The other mutation 1627insG was found associated to the wild type haplotype in more than90% of the cases. The wild type haplotype was also the most commonhaplotype found in 86% of the alleles in the control group. R59H was firstdescribed in an Italian patient and probably spread in Brazil with the Ital ian migratory waves. On the other hand the link of 1627insG to wild hap lotype in most cases suggests a more recent origin and possibly recurrent for this event. The collection of ethnic information and the analysis of 2 fur ther markers close to the gene in progress should bring valuable infor mation to clarify this issue (CNPq FAPERGS PRONEX/MCT). ,2001
1271, hop paris.frBackground Fabry disease (FD) is an X linked inborn error of glycosph ingolipid metabolism due to deficient activity of the lysosomal enzymealpha galactosidase A. The enzymatic defect results in the deposition ofuncleaved glycosphingolipids in tissular lysosomes and plasma. WhereasFD is primarily considered as a progressive small vessel disease little isknown about peripheral large arteries involvement. Recent studies havedemonstrated that genetic engineering has removed many obstacles to theclinical use of enzyme replacement and that the infusions of purifiedalpha galactosidase A are safe and biochemically active emphasizing theneed for clinical and surrogate markers to monitor efficacy of enzymereplacement therapy. Methods We investigated common carotid and radi al artery diameter intima media thickness (IMT) and distensibility in 21hemizygous FD patients and 21 age matched male controls using high definition echotracking systems and aplanation tonometry. Results Patients with FD had a significant two fold increase in radial artery IMT anddistensibility independently of body surface area age and mean BP. Withaging the increase in radial artery IMT was 2.3 fold higher in FD patientsthan in controls. Carotid IMT was mildly but significantly increased in FDpatients (+18 %) whereas distensibility was unchanged. Conclusion Thisis the first evidence of a major increase in arterial wall thickness measur able at the site of a medium sized artery in a cohort of patients with FD. The assessment of this newly recognized phenotype of FD through noninvasive procedures may prove useful for future monitoring of enzymereplacement therapy. ,2001
1272,Fabry disease an X linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal alpha galactosidase A(E. C. 3.2.1.22). Affected individuals accumulate neutral glycosphingolipids332 Posters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic Diseasewith terminal alpha linked galactosyl moieties particularly in the lysosomes of blood vessels heart and kidney. Clinically affected are hemizygotemales but heterozygote females may have an attenuated form of the dis order. This could be besides other factors due to X inactivation pattern offemale carriers. We diagnosed biochemically 35 hemizygotes and 51 heterozygotes fromnineteen Czech and Slovak families with Fabry disease. Mutations werefound by direct sequencing of purified RT PCR products from affectedmales or carrier females from 13 unrelated families. Nine new mutationswere identified each in a single family Q280K L294X D155H A153V G43D IVS 1 +2 IVS 5+3 Ã\x98Ex2 and c. 734del59. In the remaining four fam ilies four previously reported mutations were found R301X R342Q Q340X and N215S. ARMS or PCR RFLP methods were designed for specific detection of eachof the mutations. To unravel the impact of X inactivation status on clinicalmanifestation of Fabry disease in heterozygote females we optimisedmethod for determination of X inactivation pattern in tissues. These studies permit precise heterozygote detection prenatal diagnosisand further define the heterogeneity of mutations in alpha galactosidase Agene causing Fabry disease. It also helps to delineate phenotype geno type correlation. Determination of X inactivation pattern can be used in fur ther studies of Fabry disease clinical manifestations in heterozygotes.

1273, med.ac.jpA novel single point mutation G43D in exon 1 of alpha galactosidase A(alpha Gal) was identified in a Japanese of Fabry disease. The patientcomplained high fever and arthralgia. Inflammatory findings were seen onlaboratory analysis in addition to typical presentation of Fabry disease. Theadministration of prednisolone was effective to improve them. The alpha Gal cDNA from the patient and his parents was synthesized and amplifiedby RT PCR. DNA sequence analysis of 10 clones derived from each fam ily member was performed. A single amino acid substitution G43D wasfound in 10 clones of the patient 4 clones of his mother. No substitutionwas found in his father. The wild type alpha Gal cDNA and the alpha GalcDNA carrying G43D mutation derived from the patient were used for tran sient expression in COS 7 cells. Northern blot assay showed that therewas no difference between the wild type alpha Gal and the mutant alpha Gal G43D in the level of mRNA of alpha Gal. However the calculatedalpha Gal activity for G43D was 1% of that for the wild type alpha Gal. These findings indicate that G43D is a specific mutation which causes defi ciency of alpha Gal activity without reduction of mRNA and results in Fabry disease. Because this is a novel mutation G43D might be relevant to theatypical phenotype of this patient. ,2001
1274,Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD Mc Kusick 250100) a geneticallybased metabolic disorder leads to demyelination of central and peripheralnervous system. It is caused by deficient activity of arylsulphatase A(ARSA EC 3.1.6.1) which initiates the degradation of sulfatide an essen tial component of the myelin. Three types of MLD are distinguished lateinfantile juvenile and adult. Mutations 459+1G>A and P426L were mostfrequently found in MLD patients from Western Europe. Each of thesemutations accounted for 25% of all investigated MLD alleles. MutationI179S was previously described to be the most common one among Pol ish late juvenile MLD patients. A screening for these three mutations wasperformed in 33 unrelated MLD patients from Poland 12 individuals withlate infantile 15 with juvenile and 6 with adult types of MLD. GenomicDNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes and PCR RFLP meth ods were used. Prevalence of 459+1G>A in the whole collective of MLD patients was 21%. 459+1G>A accounted for 42% of investigated alleles inlate infantile 10% in juvenile and 8% in adult MLD patients. Prevalence ofP426L in all MLD patients was 18%. P426L accounted for 67% of exam ined alleles in adult and 13% in juvenile MLD patients. Prevalence of I179S in the whole group of MLD patients was 11%. I179S accounted for17% of examined alleles in adult as well as juvenile MLD patients. P426Land I179S were not found in late infantile MLD patients what confirms pre vious observation that these two mutations cause MLD of late onset types. Interestingly I179S always occured in a heterozygous state. ,2001
1275,Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are inherited neurodegenerative disorderscharacterized by the accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments in vari ous tissues. Four NCL forms are distinguished according to clinical andmorphological features infantile (INCL) late infantile (LINCL) juvenile(JNCL) and adult (ANCL). Eight loci have been described as responsiblefor these different forms among which two encode soluble enzymes palmitoyl protein thioesterase (CLN1) tripeptidyl peptidase I (CLN2). InLINCL the most common clinical form in France the CLN2 locus was fre quently involved as demonstrated by the presence of a tripeptidyl pepti dase I (TPP I) deficiency in a majority of patients. Complete sequencing ofthe CLN2 exons showed the predominance of two previously reportedmutations (3556 G >C and Arg208Stop) accounting each for 30 % of thealleles. Various novel mutations such as deletions splice or nonsensemutations were characterized on the other alleles. Some LINCL patientshad no TPP I deficiency and are likely candidate for the CLN6 or CLN7loci. One patient with a juvenile form exhibited a TPP I deficiency and car ried the 3556 G >C mutation in association with a novel point mutation. Apalmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT) deficiency was found in most of theINCL patients tested. The first CLN1 mutations characterized in thesepatients were previously reported mutations except one novel point muta tion. The study of the CLN3 CLN6 CLN7 and CLN8 loci is in progressamong the uncharacterized patients. Delineation of the various lociinvolved in NCL will allow a reliable genetic counselling and prenatal diag nosis to couples at risk for these diseases. ,2001
1276,The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are recessively inherited neu rodegenerative disorders characterised by the intralysosomal accumula tion of autofluorescent lipopigments. Four variants are classically distin guished according to clinical and ultrastructural features infantile (INCL) late infantile (LINCL) juvenile (JNCL) and adult (ANCL). Currently thereare at least 8 genetically different variants and an accurate differentiationrequires a multidisciplinary approach. Eighteen unrelated Portuguesepatients presenting a clinical course and histopathological alterations ofNCL have been studied. Based on clinical and morphological data 4 maingroups were established INCL/GROD (n=1) LINCL/CVP (n=3) JNCL/FPP (n=7) and vLINCL/CVP+FPP (n=7). The enzymatic determina tion of PPT and TPPI enzymatic activities in patient cell extracts using syn thetic fluorogenic substrates showed that INCL was caused by a deficientPPT activity whereas the LINCL was due to a defective TPPI activity thusestablishing the diagnosis of CLN1 and CLN2 respectively. Mutationanalysis by screening the 1.02kb deletion within CLN3 gene showed thatJNCL patients were all homozygous for the same gene defect. The vLIN CL patients presented a normal TPPI activity. The data suggest that 2 clin ical forms of NCL the JNCL and the vLINCL associated respectively toCLN3 gene and to an yet cloned gene might be prevalent in Portugal. Thework was supported in part by the Portuguese Health Ministery. ,2001
1277, Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is an inborn error of metabolism thatcombines clinical features of late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophyand mucopolysaccharidosis. The characteristic biochemical abnormality isa reduction in the activities of several sulfatases with consequent tissueaccumulation of sulfatides sulfated glycosaminoglycans sphingolipidsand steroid sulfates. In this study we present two unusual cases of MSDwith variable enzymatic deficiency of arylsulfatases A B and C. Bothpatients lacked hepatosplenomegaly had broad thumbs and index fingers and exhibited an unusually slow progression of clinical symptoms. Olivo pontocerebellar atrophy was present and one patient had a large retro cerebellum cyst. Mucopolysaccharides were not detectable in the urinefrom either subject. Leukocyte arylsulfatase A activity in RJ was 0.46nmoles/mg protein/h and in RW was 0.0 nmoles/mg protein/h (normal 0.7 5.0 nmoles/mg protein/h). Leukocyte arylsulfatase B activity in RJ was 24nmoles/mg protein/h and in RW 22 nmoles/mg protein/h (normal 115 226nmoles/mg protein/h). Leukocyte arylsulfatase C was in RJ 0.30pmoles/mg protein/h and in RW 0.28 pmoles/mg protein/h (normal 0.84pmoles/mg protein/h). In conclusion we presented two cases of MDS withmild clinical presentations not previously reported and variable enzymaticdeficiency of arylsulfatases A B and C. ,2001
1278,We have analyzed acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) gene mutations in 24patients with Niemann Pick disease (NPD) type A and B by direct sequenc ing of gDNA. Eighteen patients originated from former Czechoslovakia sixwere from Netherlands. Niemann Pick disease type A and B is an autoso mal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal ASM (E. C.3.1.4.12) and the resultant lysosomal sphingomyelin accumulation. Thereare 21 ASM gene mutations published up to date. Among the patients fromformer Czechoslovakia (type A 7 cases atypical type A variant 6 cases type B 5 cases ) eighteen mutations were described fifteen of themnovel. The novel mutations (type A associated fsP189 S248R D278A Q292K W533R type B associated G166R P184L R228H A241V R289H Q292K R376H R474W a fsP595) were all in heterozygous state. Three novel mutations were identified (Q292K D251E and L341P) amongatypical type A patients. Mutation Q292K is prevalent among NPD patientsfrom former Czechoslovakia (described on 38% of mutated chromo somes). Six cases (type A 3 patients type B 3 patients) from Nether lands represent one quarter of Dutch NPD patients. Number of mutationsin this group was six five of them novel (type A associated H319Y F463S P475L Y537H type B associated P371S). All of the identifiedmutations were either small deletions or of missense type. We confirmedall the novel mutations by PCR\\RFLP. ,2001
1279,The mucopolysaccharidoses(MPS)are a heterogeneous group of inbornerrors of lysosomal glycosaminoglycan metabolism. The importance of thisgroup of disorders among the inborn errors of metabolism lead us to report21 cases. We performed clinical radiological and biochemical evaluationsof the suspected patients wich allowed us to establish a definitive diagno sis in 21 cases. The diagnosis was made in average at the age of 51mo(ranging from 7 mo to 19 y). The patients were classified as follows Hurler MPS I(2 cases) Hunter MPS II(2 cases) Sanfilippo MPS III(3cases) Morquio MPS IV(4 cases) Maroteaux Lamy MPS VI(9 cases) andSly MPS VII(1 case). The high relative frequency of Maroteaux Lamy dis ease contrasts with most reports in the literature and could express a pop ulational variability. Not all patients showed increased GAG levels in urine therefore normal urinary GAG pattern does not rule out the possibility of aMPS. Diagnosis is not easy and confirmation is based with specific enzi matic investigation. ,2001
1280,In Russia registration system of patients with Gaucher disease (GD)belonging to class of hereditary storage diseases has been worked up. With the help of complex of genetic epidemiological and clinical genealog ical methods informational arrays about families with patients sufferingfrom GD have been collected. Upon this foundation the computer databaseabout Gaucher patients has been created including information on 30 var ious sections general information methods of diagnostics clinical statusof proband state of health of relatives treatment of proband. Computerbase contains information on 122 cases of GD with various clinical types. General analysis of computer database on GD showed such serious prob lems as revealing contingents of Gaucher patients and exact diagnostics. We ve executed registration of Gaucher patients and constant renewal ofdata upon patients addressing to doctor and active revealing patients inmedical institutions. The complication of GD diagnostics is related withexclusive clinical polymorphism of this pathology and availability of hardlydistinguishable geno and phenocopies. Due to this and also to newprospect for Gaucher patients it was greatly important to receive biochem ical verification of diagnosis. Diagnosis was confirmed in 66 patients bymethod of enzyme diagnostics (detection of glucocerebrosidase activity)and in 43 patients analysis of genome DNA was made and mutationsN370S ? L444P were revealed. The created computer database of Gauch er patients is used for revelation of groups of patients for making addi tional researches for verification of diagnosis made at clinical level collec tion of population statistical material for further development of medical genetic researches of GD. ,2001
1281,Mutations in the ALD gene are the molecular basis of X linkedadrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Greater than 60% of these mutations resultin an absence of ALD protein (hALDP) in the peroxisomal membrane ofcultured fibroblasts. Peroxisomes isolated from human ALD fibroblastsdemonstrate a reduced capacity to activate very long chain fatty acids(VLCFAs) to their coenzyme A derivatives and thus presumably havediminished very long chain acyl CoA synthetase (VLCS) activity. However hALDP is not a VLCS and its function remains elusive. We have cloned twohuman genes that have VLCS activity hVLCS and bubblegum (hBG). Inaddition to their capacity to activate VLCFAs both hVLCS and hBG areactive towards a broad range of substrates including long chain mono and polyunsaturated and branched chain fatty acids. hVLCS is expressedprimarily in liver and kidney although its transcript is detectable in brain in334 Posters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic Diseasecontrast hBG is expressed principally in brain. Northern blots have revealed decreased bubblegum gene expression in ALD fibroblasts. A sim ilar result was obtained using reverse transcription PCR. EndogenoushVLCS is localized to both the peroxisome and endoplasmic reticulum whereas hBG has a plasma membrane and cytosolic localization. Tran sient overexpression of hBG or hVLCS in ALDP deficient fibroblasts doesnot correct the defect in peroxisomal ÃÂ§ oxidation that results from the faultyactivation step. However co overexpression of hVLCS and hALDP inALDP deficient cells has a synergistic effect and restores ÃÂ§ oxidationbeyond that obtained with hALDP alone. Further studies to elucidate aputative interplay between hALDP and hVLCS and/or hBG are in progress. ,2001
1282,We previously found a significant reduction from the expected number ofmice born that were either heterozygous (45% of expected) or homozy gous (60% of expected) for the null allele for long chain acyl CoA dehy drogenase (LCAD). We hypothesized that this may be due to either anenergy deficiency in the embryo or a toxic effect on the embryo in the het erozygous or homozygous mother. Since development from morula toblastocyst is a major energy consuming process we hypothesized thatLCAD deficient embryos would exhibit reduced developmental compe tence as demonstrated by a failure to proceed from compaction throughblastocoel formation. To investigate the development of early embryos ofall three genotypes (LCAD+/+ +/ / ) we cultured early embryos from day1 post copulation to day 8. We found a significant decrease in LCAD / embryos starting at days 3 4 (morula to blastocyst stages) resulting in a8.7% survival rate as compared to 56% survival rate in LCAD+/+ and 32%survival rate in LCAD+/ embryos (p=0.012 ANOVA). We also haveobserved that we have been unable to develop congenic LCAD+/ mouselines on the C57BL/6 background due to the severe rate of loss of offspringin G2 when backcrossing mice with the B6 129 starting genetic back ground whereas the backcrosses done using 129/SvEv mice yielded theexpected ratio of offspring with the mutant allele (~50%). We speculate thatthere is a profound modifier gene(s) in the B6 background that promotesfor gestational loss that is independent of the energy deficiency thatappears to be correlated with a simple gene dosage effect in the culturedembryos. These studies are particularly important to help understand thefact that no human LCAD deficient patient has been documented. ,2001
1283, muenchen.deCarnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) an enzyme associated with theinner mitochondrial membrane plays a crucial role in the transport of long chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for b oxidation. CPT II defi ciency is an autosomal recessive disorder which presents itself as two phe notypes a severe infantile form and a milder muscular form which typical ly manifests around puberty. Patients with the adult form suffer from mus cular pain rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria triggered by extensive exer cise. Currently the diagnosis is based on the determination of CPTenzyme activity in muscle biopsies or fibroblasts. Here we report a non invasive diagnostic strategy based on the tandem mass spectrometric(TMS) determination of acylcarnitines which allows the detection of CPT II deficiency in serum samples. In CPT II deficiency long chain acylcar nitines accumulate in the serum thereby generating a highly characteristicTMS spectrum. These spectra are characterized by distinct elevations ofpalmitoyl oleoyl stearoyl carnitine. They are consistently obtained in allCPT II patients are absent in patients with unspecific muscle symptomsand controls and differ markedly from that of other inborn errors of lipidmetabolism. We propose that TMS of serum acylcarnitines allows us toeasily screen suspect cases thereby facilitating a rapid diagnosis and low ering the risk of serious complications. In some cases TMS together withmolecular genetic testing even renders it possible to establish the diagno sis without undertaking a muscle biopsy. This view is supported by therecent identification of a child presenting the typical symptoms of the adultform of CPT II deficiency. ,2001
1284, hop paris.frCACT deficiency is a rare severe autosomal recessive disorder of longchain fatty acid oxidation and has a bad prognosis. A multiplex PCR fol lowed by cycle sequencing was developed to detect mutations in theCACT gene. The entire coding regions intron/exon splice junctions wereamplified in a single tube by multiplex PCR using 9 pairs of primers and thePCR products were submitted to cycle sequencing. Genomic DNA analy sis was performed in 12 unrelated patients and was confirmed in parentsin 9 families. On the 24 alleles 11 molecular abnormalities were identified two of them at a higher frequency. Among these two a homozygote splic ing mutation (261 10T >G) already described in 2 eurasian patients wasfound in 3 unrelated asiatic patients. Two point mutations at the samecodon (R178X R178Q) were found in 3 other unrelated north african fam ilies. Prenatal diagnosis carried out by our group were previously per formed by enzymatic methods on cultured cells (trophoblasts or amnio cytes). However results were obtained after several weeks of cell growth. Mutation identification has allowed a prenatal diagnosis in 4 families. In 2families mutation analysis was started only after amniotic fluid samplingand prenatal diagnosis conducted on cultured amniocytes. In the two otherfamilies genomic studies were performed on crude chorionic villi and resultwas obtained in 3 days. Two carriers an affected foetus and an unaffect ed foetus were identified. Long chain fatty acid oxidation assays and CACTactivity measurements performed on cultured trophoblasts and/or amnio cytes confirmed the results one month later. ,2001
1285,3 hydroxy 3 methyl glutaric aciduria (HA) is an autosomal recessive inbornerror of metabolism produced by mutation in 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HL) gene. HL is a mitochondrial enzyme which catalyses thelast step of both ketogenesis and leucine catabolism. Two novel pointmutations in HL gene were found in patients from Argentina and UnitedKingdom with biochemically diagnosed 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaricaciduria. Mutations Ser201Tyr and Asp204Asn one in each patient weredetected by sequencing the PCR amplified exons. The Ser201Tyr mutationinterferes with the proper assembly of the substrate as demostrated in atridimensional model of HMGCoA lyase and the Asp204Asn mutationbreaks the interaction Asp204 His233 responsible for the nucleophilicattack to the substrate. The mutational changes in tridimensional modelsof HMGCoA lyase and their implications in the patients phenotypes arediscussed. ,2001
1286,The change of amino acid (AA) concentrations in body fluids is critical forthe diagnosis of aminoacidopathy and malnutrition. Because of the lowerphysiological maturity of organs in pre term infants AA metabolism isaffected that results in inconsistency of AA concentrations in the body flu ids especially in urine. In order to accurately interpret urine AA results well documented urine AA control values for pre term infants are absolute ly required. In our study we report the control range of urine AA concen trations in pre term infants before and after formula or human milk fed inthe mean time we also evaluate the difference of individual AA concentra tion among these 5 groups by proceeding statistical analysis. Urine aminoacid levels (in nmol/mg cretinine) were measured by ion exchange chro matography method. Urine samples were collected from 34 pre term (28 35 Wks) infants before the first milk feeding 1 and 4 weeks after milk fed in which 12 infants fed with human milk and the rest 22 fed with pre termformula milk with regular amounts. When comparing the urine AA valuesbefore and after milk fed by pair t test a significant mean difference wasfound between the first milk feeding group and the 1st week after milk fedgroup (p < 0.05) however an insignificant mean difference was obtainedbetween the first milk feeding group and the 4th week after milk fed group. For individual AA all the infants either fed with formula or human milkshowed significant decrease in concentrations of cystine (approximately51.4 to 57.4% Ã\x82) and tryptophan (approximately 21.5 to 27.3% ). Essentialamino acids such as valine leucine isoleucine and phenylalanine showed significant decrease in concentrations in the formula fed groups but not in the human milk fed groups. Conclusively urine AA levels in pre term infants is 2 4 folds higher than that of full term infants and this con firmed the lower physiological maturity of digestive function and AA metab olism in pre term infants. In addition human milk is much better than pre term formula milk in AAs supply for growth and development. Finally thenew established urine AA control values is valuable for clinical application especially for the diagnosis of AA metabolic disorders. ,2001
1287,Plasma and/or urinary aminoacid analyses were performed by a two dimensional thin layer chromatography procedure (Wadman & al. 1981) inchildren suspected for having perturbances of aminoacid metabolism. Anumber of over 1700 samples from patients reffered by the Neuro Psychi atry Clinic and other Paediatric services from Cluj Napoca were analysedbetween 1980 2000. Out of these 54 cases were diagnosed as hyper phenylalaninemias/phenylketonurias one case of oculocerebrorenal Lowesyndrome. These are definite disturbances of aminoacid metabolism asso ciated with mental retardation. The molecular defects with metabolic blocksand accumulations of some metabolites in the body fluids explain the clin ical features. We also include a case of sarcosinemia a case of histidin uria rare and controversial genetic disorders concerning neurologic abnor malities determination. ,2001
1288, wuerzburg.deThe research programme on alkaptonuria (AKU OMIM # 203500) in Slo vakia was started in 1968 by the Institute of Clinical Genetics at Martin and in its first stage was focussed on clinical biochemical genetic and epi demiological questions. Based on a screening programme of now 610.000inhabitants (including 509.000 newborns) the world wide highest incidenceof AKU (1 in 19.000) was recorded and a total of 208 patients (including110 children) were registered. Through the co operation of the families extensive genealogical studies (sometimes over 2 centuries) were madepossible. Most AKU ancestors could be traced to their original geographiclocations predominantly in remote mountain regions. A high degree ofinbreeding was noted in these areas. These epidemilogical data formedthe basis for molecular studies which began in 1991 in collaboration withthe Wuerzburg group. The AKU locus was mapped to human chromosome3q2 by orthology to the mouse locus aku the homogentisate 1 2 dioxyge nase genes (HGD) were cloned from mouse and man and nine differentmutations were identified in AKU patients These include 4 missense 2splice site 2 insertion and one novel 1 bp deletion mutation. The most fre quent mutations in Slovakia are G161R and c.1278insC (P370fs) whichwere found on 16 (= 40 %) and 7 (= 17.5 %) respectively of the 40 AKUchromosomes from the 20 index cases. To date the genotypes of 28patients and 68 relatives from 20 families have been established andserved as the basis for genetic counselling. The highest incidence andallelic heterogeneity was observed in the Kysuce district (125.500 inhabi tants) with 5 different mutations on 11 AKU chromosomes. An analysis ofthe association between HGD intragenic markers and mutations and of thegeographical origins of the AKU chromosomes suggests that severalfounders have contributed to the HGD gene pool. While there is nostraightforward explanation for this clustering of independent mutations subsequent genetic isolation is likely to be responsible for the high preva lence of AKU in Slovakia. ,2001
1289,Biotin deficiency is a nutritional phenocopy of Multiple Carboxylase Defi ciency. Regulation of genetic expression of carboxylases and holocar boxylase synthetase (HCS) is poorly understood and may have importantconsequences for their genetic defects. We investigated the regulation ofHCS mRNA and of pyruvate (PC) propionyl CoA (PCC) and 3 methylcrotonyl CoA (MCC) carboxylases mRNAs and their protein mass in liver kidney muscle and brain. HCS mRNA levels were significantly reduced. The decrease in HCS mRNA was reversed when biotin was injected intodeficient animals the recovery being a delayed effect apparent over 24hours after vitamin administration. These changes seem to be the firstknown instance in mammals of an effect of a water soluble vitamin onmRNA functionally related to it. On the other hand the expected carboxy lases activity decrement was associated with a reduction in the amount oftheir enzyme proteins but not in their mRNA levels. Only in the brain PCand PCC amounts did not change significantly. In conclusion this workprovides evidence for biotin being a modulator of the genetic expression ofthe enzymes involved in its function as a cofactor. As such it may be a use ful model for probing a similar role for other water soluble vitamins.

1290,336 Posters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic DiseaseMethionine synthase reductase (MTRR) is presumably required for reduc tive activation of methionine synthase which remethylates homocysteine. MTRR deficiency is a putative cause of the cblE type of homocystinuria arare autosomal recessive disorder. This disease manifests in childhoodwith megaloblastic anaemia neurological disease and psychomotor retar dation. MTRR gene mutations are reported in 9 patients with cblE type ofhomocystinuria but normal and mutant gene products have not yet beencharacterised. Our ongoing studies are directed at the molecular characterisation of anadditional 7 patients with clinical biochemical and enzymological evidenceof functional methionine synthase deficiency and cblE confirmed by com plementation studies. In one case we identified homozygosity for a 140 bp insertion (903ins140)caused by a T >C transition within intron 6 of the MTRR gene presumablyleading to exon splicing enhancer activation. First trimester prenatal diag nosis was possible in this family by analysis of this mutation. Anotherpatient was heterozygous for a deletion of exon 2 at the mRNA level theonly nucleotide change in exon 2 and flanking intronic regions was anintronic mutation IVS 201G >A. The mechanism by which this intronicmutation leads to exon 2 skipping is unknown. Transient transfection of twocblE fibroblast cell lines with a eukaryotic expression vector containing wildtype MTRR cDNA revealed 2.2 and 3 fold increases of methionine syn thesis compared with untransfected cells. Restoration of methionine syn thase activity following transfection with wild type MTRR supports with afunctional assay the idea that cblE is due to defects in the MTRR gene. ,2001
1291,Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) the key enzyme in the transsulfura tion pathway of homocysteine is a homotetramer of 63 kDa subunits. Each subunit binds five ligands serine and homocysteine as substrates cofactor pyridoxal 5ÃÂ« phosphate allosteric activator S adenosylmethionineand heme with unknown function. Deficiency of CBS is the most commoncause of homocystinuria. The majority of mutations are missense muta tions with unknown impact on protein function. We determined the degreeof assembly of CBS subunits in cultured skin fibroblasts of 13 patients withCBS deficiency. The native western blot analysis showed only high molec ular weight aggregates and absence of the tetramer. Five selectedmutants A114V A155T E176K I278T and del ex12 were expressed inE. coli. All mutants formed aggregates lacking heme while only the A114Vmutant yielded traces of active CBS heme containing tetramer. An ongoingstudy will determine the effect of chemical chaperones on the folding ofmutant CBS using both an E.coli and an eukaryotic expression systems. Our results show that the decreased affinity and/or inability to bind hemeprevent correct folding and subsequent tetramer formation of mutant CBS. This can make the mutants less stable prone to misfolding and aggrega tion. We postulate that similarly to other genetic defects mutant CBS mis folding and aggregation may be the primary defect in a significant propor tion of homocystinuric patients. ,2001
1292,Females with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) have a het erogeneous clinical expression. Diagnosing at risk OTCD females isimportant for determining reproductive risks and preventing potentially cat astrophic hyperammonemia. Diagnosis of partial OTCD during asympto matic periods is difficult. The allopurinol challenge used in the diagnosis ofOTCD females may give rise to both false negatives and positives andDNA diagnosis is unable to detect mutations in all cases especially inOTCD females or unusual presentations in males. We have previouslyused the ratio of isotopic enrichments of 15N urea/15N glutamine (15N U/G) as a sensitive index of in vivo urea cycle activity. We have now applied this method in an integrated approach to aid in the diagnosis and prospectivemanagement of a symptomatic female with suspected partial OTCD inwhom a mutation in the OTC gene was not found on clinical testing. The 15N U/G ratio in this patient showed a severe reduction of in vivo urea cycle activity that correlated with deficient OTC activity in her liver level of orot ic aciduria and severe clinical phenotype. Stable isotope studies may pro vide a sensitive tool in combination with other measures to aid in the diag nosis of at risk OTCD females. The decision to resort to orthotopic livertransplantation (OLT) in OTCD females is controversial requiring consider ation of phenotypic severity access to tertiary care centers and social fac tors. In this patient the use of this diagnostic approach in conjunction witha consideration of her clinical history and medical social situation led to adecision for OLT. ,2001
1293,Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC EC 2.1.3.3) deficiency is the most com mon inborn error of the urea cycle and shows an X linked inheritance withfrequent new mutations. Inherited deficiency of OTC in hemizygous affect ed males usually results in severe ammonia intoxication lethargy vomitingand early death. Mild forms of OTC deficiency may be present later evenduring adulthood. Symptoms and signs may include coma mental retar dation protein avoidance headache bizarre behaviour or episodic hyper ammonemia. The broad aim of this study is to provide biochemical andmolecular characterisation of OTC deficiencies and diagnosis of OTCasymptomatic carrier status in Portuguese affected families. Biochemicaldiagnosis is established by the finding of increased plasma ammonia andglutamine decreased plasma citrulline and increased urine orotate excre tion. Tests of proteins and allopurinol loading are used in an attempt todetect carrier females when biochemical determinations are inconclusive. By PCR amplification followed by SSCP and HCSGE we have detectedtwo recurrent mutations (R141Q and G195R) and a novel mutation in thedonor splice site of intron 2 (IVS2 +1 g?t). R141Q and G195R mutationswere found in two unrelated females and IVS2 +1 was found in a malewith 10% of OTC activity determined by hepatic biopsy. Haplotypic infor mation obtained with two flanking markers of OTC gene (DXS997 andDXS1068) and four intragenic markers (Ex4 46 IVS3 8nt IVS4 7nt Ex8270) was performed in affected families in order to provide informationabout lineage haplotypes. ,2001
1294,Objective This study is to investigate the neurotoxicity of hyperphenylala nine and to explore the possible mechanisms. Methods The primary cul tured cortical and hippocampal neurons of embryonic rat were cultured inNeurobasal exposed to hyperphenylalanine (Phe) and assayed the sur vival rate. The morphological changes were observed by special staining.bcl 2 fas and c fos were tested by immunohistochemistry and RT PCR. Results The survival rate of cortical neurons was significantly decreasedcompared to normal controls in present Phe at 300 mol/L 600 mol/L 1200 mol/L and shown a dose dependent. Positive apoptotic neurons increased with the concentration of Phe by TUNEL staining and observedunder electronic microscope. The positive neurons of fas and c fosincreased than normal control by immunohistochemistry with the exceptionof bcl 2. The mRNA expression of c fos increased accordingly while that ofbcl 2 decreased. Conclusion Apoptotic neurons were induced by hyper phenylalanine. The abnormal expression of some genes may hasten theneuronal apoptosis such as the upregulation of fas and c fos genes andthe downregulation of bcl 2. ,2001
1295,X linked ichthyosis (XLI) is due to the steroid sulfatase (STS) deficiency. STS assay PCR and FISH analyses are useful to establish diagnosis andto discard XLI carriers. The present study analyzes the frequency and sizePosters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic Disease 337of molecular deletions of the steroid sulfatase (STS) encoding gene in a sample of 90 Mexican subjects with biochemical diagnosis of X linkedichthyosis (XLI). XLI patients were analyzed through STS assay PCRamplification of the 5 3 ends and flanking markers of the STS gene andFISH analysis. No amplification of the 3 and 5 ends of the STS gene byPCR was detected in the DNA of 86 patients 2 samples presented a nor mal amplification 1 amplified the 3 end and 1 amplified the 5 end of thegene. FISH analysis was positive for XLI in 87 patients the 3 patients thatshowed a normal hibridization pattern were a point mutation and 2 intra genic deletions. 32 patients presented the rupture sites at flanking markersDXS996 and DXS278 24 patients had the breakpoints at flanking markersDXS996 and DXS1134 and the rest (24 subjects) showed heterogeneousrupture sites. This report shows a very high frequency and heterogeneouspattern of deletions in the human STS encoding gene in a representativesample of the Mexican population and it defines the characteristics ofFISH analysis and PCR to diagnose XLI patients ,2001
1296,Steroid sulfatase (STS) deficiency is an inherited error of metabolism caus ing X linked ichthyosis (XLI). Onset is at birth or early after birth and it isclinically characterized by dark regular and adherent scales of skin. Approximately 85 90% of XLI patients have large deletions of the STSgene and flanking sequences. Only seven patients have been reportedwith partial deletions of the STS gene. These include a deletion withinintron 7 extending over exons 8 10 of the STS gene a partial deletion thatincluded exon 10 an intragenic deletion spanning exons 2 5 a partial dele tion within intron 1 and between flanking sequences DXS1131 andDXS1133. It has also been reported two unrelated cases with partial dele tions at the 5 end of the STS gene. In this study we describe an intragenicdeletion of the STS gene in an XLI patient and his mother. The subject andhis mother were classified through STS assay in leukocytes using 7 [3H] dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate as a substrate. Exons 1 10 of the STSgene were analyzed by PCR and DNA sequence analysis. STS activitywas undetectable in the XLI patient (0.0 pmol/mg protein/h) and very lowin his mother (0.32 pmol/mg protein/h vs 0.84 pmol/mg protein/h of normalcontrol). DNA sequence analysis showed a 3 bp deletion (AAGdel1252)within exon 7 of the STS gene in both the patient and his mother. At thismoment we have analyzed more than 100 XLI patients and found two par tial deletions of the STS gene. This is the first 3 bp deletion of the STSgene causing XLI. ,2001
1297,Porphyrias are metabolic disorders caused by decreased activity ofenzymes in hem biosynthesis. Their clinical manifestation in early child hood is rare and include congenital erythropoietic porphyria erythropoiet ic protoporphyria and homozygous forms of acute hepatic porphyrias. Wepresent the results of biochemical and molecular analyses in 3 childrenwith homozygous form of porphyria variegata (PV). The clinical symptomsin two children were already described (1). The third patient is a boy withshort stature short fingers and slight mental retardation who developedsevere photosensitivity in the age of two years. The plasma fluorescenceemission maximum of 626 nm was pathognomonic for VP and theincreased protoporphyrin (PP IX) levels in erythrocytes were in agreementwith our previous description of increased PP IX levels in homozygouscases with porphyria variegata (2). Genetic analysis was performed bydenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of protoporphyrinogenoxidase gene and by subsequent sequencing of atypical DGGE pattern. Two different mutations in the boy were found 1072G>A resulting inGly358Arg in exon 10 and IVS10+4T>G in intron 10. The Gly358Arg muta tion is identical with the mutation we found in our 2 other patients withhomozygous variegate porphyria (3). Expression of this mutation in E. colishowed 9.5% residual activity as compared to wt protoporphyrinogen oxi dase. 1. Kordac V. Deybach J. C. Mart sek P . et al. Lancet I 851 1984. 2. Kordac V.

1298,In the last decade there have been many exciting developments in thefield of inborn errors of purine and pyrimidine metabolism. These disordersshould be suspected in any case of unexplained anaemia failure to thrive susceptibility to recurrent infection or neurological deficits with no currentdiagnosis including autism cerebral palsy developmental delay deaf ness epilepsy self mutilation muscle weakness inability to walk or talk gout and sometimes renal disease. The diagnosis of the majority of theknown inherited defects of purine and pyrimidine metabolism can beachieved by the analysis of urinary excretion profiles by reversed phasehigh performance liquid chromatography and multi wavelengh UV detec tion. Once perfected this technique has important clinical applications forhigh risk screening and follow up. We have established control values forsixteen different metabolites thus permitting the possibility of diagnosingthirteen different diseases. Since the beginning of our analyses (October1998) we have found seven positive cases one molybdenum cofactordeficiency one dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency and five ade nine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency. The analysis of purines andpyrimidines is a useful tool when investigating prenatal and neonatal dis eases. ,2001
1299,Background MyoAdenilate Deaminase Deficiency (MADD) is responsibleof a bening metabolic myopathy characterized by muscle fatiguability cramps myalgias and more rarely exertional myoglobinuria (primaryform). The most known molecular defect of MADD is the nonsense muta tion C34T transition at codon 12(Gln to Stop) in exon 2 in AMPD1 gene predicting a severely truncated MAD peptide. MADD may also present inassociation with other neuromuscular disorders in the so called coinci dental form. Furthermore it is known that MAD isoform M is abundantlyexpressed in type 2b muscle fibers. We have recently observed a numberof patients with myalgias reduced percentage of type 2b fibers and low orabsent MAD activity and no associated neuromuscular diseases. Thesefeatures suggest a third form af MADD that can be defined as secondaryform. Objective To characterize the clinical morphological biochemicaland molecular aspects of the three forms of MADD. Materials & Methods We investigated 31 unrelated patients with MADD 5 with the primary form 18 with the coincidental form and 8 with the secondary form. Results 13patients are homozygous for the C34T mutation (5 primary and 8 coinci dental form) presenting with a residual MAD activity <1% of control range. 10 patients with coincidental form are heterozygous for the nonsensemutation and 5 of them had a very low biochemical activity <8%. 8patients with selective muscle type 2b fibers atrophy and a reduced MADactivity (4 30%) did not carry the MADD mutation. Conclusion 1) patientswith the primary form had the homozygous mutation and residual MADactivity <1% 2) patients with the coincidental form may present with verylow activity and homozygous or heterozygous trait for C34T mutation 3)patients with the secondary form may have variable residual MAD activ ity (4 to 30%) but do not carry the most known MADD mutation. ,2001
1300,Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase(G6PD) deficiency was firstly identi fied from the results of research on primaquine which is used in malariatherapy and its effects on hemolysis during 1950 s in US. During the time course of G6PD research it is clearly observed that biochemical charac teristics molecular identification of the G6PD protein variant analysis andthe structure function relationships has been intensively studied. Theregional distribution of the G6PD deficiency is closely related with geo graphic regions which are endemic for malaria. First enzyme dificiency was reported on 1940 in Turkey. According to theWHO criteria there are about 20 biochemically identified variants in338 Posters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic DiseaseTurkey. The variants named as Gd Aksu Gd Serik Gd Korkuteli in Antalya region(western Mediterranean) on the other hand Gd Mersin Gd BalcalÃÂ± Gd Samanda? Gd Adana ve Gd Antakya variants were identified in ukurova(eastern Mediterranean) region. The overall distribution of G6PD deficieny is about 5 % in Turkey. In ukurova region G6PD deficiency was reported by different research groups as 8.5 %(Ozsoylu etal 1975) 5.8 %(Akoglu et al 1981) 7.6 % (KÃÂ±lÃÂ±nc et al 1982) 8.3 % (Yuregir et al 1984) 8.2 % (Aksoy et al 1981) on the other hand in Antalya region 9.2 %(Aksoy et al 1990) in Eagean Region 2 9 % (Sipahioglu et al 1979) inEastern Turkey Erzurum 1 % (Aksu et al 1972).The main molecular defect causing the G6PD deficieny in Turkey is theMediterranean mutation identified as 563T. On the other hand Med2 hap lotype and 1311T mutation are observed together frequently. (*)G6PD Working Group Bagci H. Aksoy K. Tuli A. Acikbas I. Atalay E. Aksu A. Gumuslu S. Solak M. Turan Y.

1301, hop paris.frWe report on a girl affected with Menkes disease. She is the first child ofyoung healthy parents. Two maternal uncles died in early infancy fromMenkes disease. Her mother was shown to be carrier by DNA analysis withpolymorphic markers. The girl was born prematurely at 35 weeks. Firstmonths were marked by chronic diarrhea and failure to thrive. Psychomo tor development was delayed with head control at 7 months. At 18months examination showed major hypotonia. She was unable to sit. Smiling following with eyes and social contact were good. She had aprominent occiput sparse scalp hair with pili torti and cutis laxa. Menkes disease was suspected on familial history. Serum copper and ceruloplas min were slightly reduced. Menkes disease was confirmed by increasedcopper accumulation in cultured fibroblasts. Karyotype was normal. MRIshowed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Abdominal ultrasound was nor mal as were skeletal radiographs. Females affected with Menkes diseaseare extremely rare. Expression of the disease is explained in some casesby 45X syndrome or balanced translocations with breakpoints at the MNKlocus. Non random inactivation is supposed to be responsible for clinicalexpression females with normal karyotype. X inactivation study in lympho cytes is in progress. ,2001
1302,We have assessed the levels of haplotype diversity associated with rarenon S and non Z alpha 1 antitrypsin (PI) variants by analysing a SNP sit uated in intron Ic of the PI gene and three microsatellites located within orclose to corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) alpha 1 antitrypsin and pro tein C inhibitor (PCI) at chromosome 14q32.1 PCI 190kb PI 60kb CBG. Using protein isoelectric focusing followed by DNA sequence analysis atotal of 35 unrelated variants belonging to 14 distinct allelic classes wereidentified in samples from Portugal the Basque Country and S o Tom ePr ncipe I (Arg39Cys n=7) a newly identified normal Ser47Arg mutation(Slisbon n=2) Mmalton (Phe52del n=2) T (Arg101His or Glu264Val n=3) M4 (Arg101His or Asp376Glu n=8) V (Gly148Arg n=1) Plowell(Asp256Val n=1) R281del (Arg281del n=1) Pdonauwoerth (Asp341Asn n=2) Zaugsburg (Glu342Lys n=1) Q0mattawa (Leu353insT n=1) S o Tom (Pro362His n=1) Mheerlen (Pro369Leu n=3) Mwurzburg(Pro369Ser n=2). Haplotype and sequencing information suggest thatsome variants could have arisen either from recurrent mutation or intra genic recombination the mutations defining the Mheerlen and Q0mattawavariants were found in allelic backgrounds that are different from thoseoriginally reported the I allele displays levels of haplotype heterogeneitycompatible with at least one additional independent origin M4 haplotypessuggest independent origins through recurrence of the His101Arg mutationand through recombination between M2 and M1Val213 the T allele is theprobable result from recombination between S and M2 (or M4). These dataconfirm and extend previous observations that a limited repertoire of muta tions is responsible for a significant fraction of PI sequence variation. ,2001
1303,We investigated the effect of shifting the register of the collagen helix by asingle Gly X Y triplet on collagen assembly stability and incorporation intofibrils and matrix. These studies utilized a collagen mutation occurring inlethal type II OI. The proband has a triplet duplication in COL1A1 exon 44cDNA and gDNA subclones. The normal allele encodes 2 identical Gly Ala Hyp triplets at aa 868 874 while the mutant allele encodes three. The reg ister shift delays helix formation causing overmodification of all CNBr pep tides. Pericellular processing of secreted procollagen demonstrated morerapid appearance of pC and mature collagen than control. In matrixdeposited by proband cultured fibroblasts overmodified chains were abun dant in the immaturely cross linked fraction but constituted a minor fractionof maturely cross linked collagen. Trimers purified from cell culture exhib ited markedly different behavior depending on whether they had two (+/+) one (+/ ) or no ( / ) mutant ?1 chains. Differential scanning calorimetryrevealed that +/+ molecules denature in sequential steps 6 o 5oand 4oC below the Tm of wild type protein +/ molecules denature in a single step 2 oC below wild type. The three species appeared to be secreted in a 1 2 1 ratio consistent with random chain association. In vitro fibrillogenesis ofthis mixture produced fibers containing no +/+ molecules and smaller +/ to / ratio than the starting mixture. The rate and extent of fiber formationwere comparable to wild type only at 4X higher protein concentration. Theprofound effects of shifting the collagen triplet register correlate with thesevere clinical outcome. ,2001
1304,Objective To measure plasma chitotriosidase levels in patients with b tha lassemia and to ascertain correlation with severity and/or other parame ters. Introduction Chitotriosidase produced by macrophages is a markerof severity and response to therapy in Gaucher disease. Since there isexpansion of the reticuloendothelial system chitotriosidase may be equal ly useful in b thalassemia. Material and Methods 39 adults (16 53 years 30 with b thalassemia major 9 with intermedia) and 14 children (0.7 15years 12 with b thalassemia major 2 with intermedia) were tested for chi totriosidase and correlated with ferritin hemoglobin liver function tests and genotype. Results Plasma chitotriosidase levels were normal (<20mU/ml) in all children. Only 16 adults had elevated levels and 12 of these >80 mU/ml. There was no correlation with genotype age type hemoglo bin transfusions/year or chelating treatment. The patient with the highestchitotriosidase (1440 mU/ml) had the highest ferritin (5175 mg/l) requiredthe most transfusions/year (40) and had abnormal liver tests. Ferritin andpoor therapy compliance correlated with chitotriosidase levels. Discussion Normal levels in the pediatric cohort and increased levels in only someadults may reflect status of iron overload in macrophages and may suggesta role for monitoring chitotriosidase. Our results are in contradistinction toBarone et al s in an Italian cohort. Conclusions These results may impli cate a role for plasma chitotriosidase levels in monitoring clinical parame ters and response to therapy in patients with b thalassemia. ,2001
1305,A rapid progress in human genetics by the end of this millennium is main ly due to advances in laboratory technology available at the fingertips ofthe clinicians for accurate specific and reliable genetic diagnosis. Howev er genetics takes a back seat in the Indian scenario due to other nationalhealth priorities. The concept of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM) beingrare (4Ã¢\x80\x946%) was based on the older conventional methods of TLC andGC. In view of this a powerful tool like GC / MS was used in the simulta neous detection of 101 congenital metabolic abnormalities of amino acids organic acids sugars sugar acids sugar alcohols nucleic acids andPosters: Biochemical Basis of Genetic Disease 339nucleic acid bases. The present paper reports chemical diagnosis of 355 highÃ¢\x80\x94risk childrenwith definite diagnosis of IEM in 58 cases (16.4%) using Mass Spectrom etry. In criticallyÃ¢\x80\x94ill neonates the metabolic abnormalities was 28.26% (13out of 46 neonates). This emphasises the crucial role of GC/MS in pre venting mortality and morbidity.

Recognition of congenitalmetabolic disorders at the primary health care levels by creating aware ness among medical professionals and developing resources like techni cal expertise and sophisticated equipments are the key factors in genetichealthcare. The Indian population with religious racial and ethnic diversityindicates a great scope of GC / MS diagnostic technology in establishingthe epidemiology of congenital metabolic disorders which is currently lack ing. ,2001
1306,The Maple Syrup Urine Disease is an inborn error of metabolism producedby genetics mutation. In Panama they have been identified few cases allof them children from the indigenous group know as Tule. In these casesthe fatality has been high in the absence of a precocious diagnostic thatwould let a better handling. We had the opportunity of handling a case withexanguine transfusion and especial milk formula getting very good resultsclinical as well as those from laboratory. Clinical Case. It treats of a child of59 days who begins his symptomatology since 6to day of life with a clini cal chart of irritability strong and sharp crying poor feeding vomiting andhyporexia he has treated in an ambulatory way. On the eleven day of thelife he enters to the institution for being with greater irritability without suc tion and with opisthotonos. After the handling in the Hospital and with sta ble clinical evolution the newborn goes out with a diagnosis of Syndromeof the rigid boy and a treatment with Mogadon at the 59 days.

The blood and urine aminoacid chromatography gives positive forleucine valine and isoleucine giving no doubt in the diagnosis. The clinicalcharacteristics that this patient shows are typical of the classic MSUD. Webelieve important to report this case because the signs and symptoms(including the characteristic odor of the urine) of a children who as beenasymptomatic the first 4 days of life must orient us toward a metabolic dis ease first in the group of the intermediates organic acidemias which maybe corroborated with laboratory test hat is available in our media and whichcan be made very fast. ,2001
1307,"Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a very common autosomal reces sive disorder of iron metabolism with a genetic incidence of about 1 in 200individuals of Northern European descent. HH is characterized by pro gressive accumulation of iron in various organs (liver heart pancreas) ultimately leading to liver cirrhosis diabetes arthritis cardiomyopathiesand premature death. With early diagnosis and treatment by therapeuticphlebotomy survival of patients is normal. A number of point mutationswithin a novel MHC class I like gene (HFE) have been identified and relat ed to HH. While homozygozity for C282Y is observed in the majority of HHpatients the diagnostic value of other HFE mutations is still under investi gation. More recently mutations in the gene encoding transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) have been found in individuals with non HFE haemochromatosis. We have developed a reverse hybridization assay (HaemochromatosisStripAssay) for the rapid and simultaneous detection of known mutationsin the HFE and TFR2 genes. The test is based on a single multiplex DNAamplification reaction and ready to use test strips containing oligonu cleotide probes for each wild type and mutated allele immobilized as par allel lines. The entire procedure from blood sampling to the identification ofmutations requires less than 6 hours and may be automated on existingequipment (e.g. TECAN profiBlot). (', ') ",2001
1308,Prader Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndromes (AS) are caused by the lossof function of imprinted genes in proximal 15q. The PWS and AS imprint ing mutations include the DMR (Regions of allele specific DifferentialMethylation) at the CpG islands of the SNRPN locus which may lead toincorrect resetting of the imprint in the germ line. We are using M PCR(Methylation specific PCR) which can rapidly assess the methylation sta tus of CpG sites within a CpG island without using methylation sensitiverestriction enzymes. This assay entails initial modification of DNA by sodi um bisulfite converting only unmethylated cytosines to uracils and subse quent amplification with primers specifically designed for the methylated orunmethylated version of the CpG island of SNRPN. A retrospective studyconducted on 42 DNA samples previously analyzed by Southern blottingshowed 100% concordance on 15 PWS 4 AS and 23 normal samples. Adiagnostic test is now routinely performed on DNAs from various sources(blood Guthrie cards CVS). In the last year we analyzed 65 subjects withsuspected PWS/AS nine showed the methylation pattern of PWS two themethylation pattern of AS and fifthy four were normal. M PCR is a reliablemethod in the differential diagnosis of neonatal hypotonias and of the var ious forms of obesity/hypotonia/mental retardation. The advantage of M PCR when compared with previous PCR based techniques or Southernblot are the rapidity sensitivity the use of cheap reagents and the possi bility of detecting the major classes of molecular defects causing PWS/AS(deletions uniparental disomy and imprinting mutations) without the needof parental DNA. ,2001

1310,Now that the sequencing of the human genome is nearing completion theinitiation of the next phase or the annotation phase of the human genomeproject is starting to unfold. This next phase will focus on determining thenumber and types of genes present identifying how these genes controland regulate biological processes and characterizing the variations thatare observed between individuals. A key component of this analysis is theidentification localization and population frequency determination of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In collaboration with The SNP Consor tium (TSC) Orchid BioSciences is determining SNP allelic frequencies insamples from three different defined populations and selected CEPH pedi grees. Using Orchid s high throughput single base primer extension tech nology SNP IT approximately forty individuals from each of the Cau casian African American and Asian populations are being analyzed to esti mate the frequencies of more than 60 000 SNPs distributed equally acrossthe genome. The 60 000 TSC SNPs are also being analyzed on 10 CEPHpedigrees for the determination of both allelic frequency and phase of theSNP. The pedigrees are also useful as a tool for error checking of the SNPassays and the determination of haplotypes. Results from the analysis ofthe CEPH pedigrees will provide the initial components for a linkage dise qualibrium (LD) map of the genome. New software tools are being devel oped and utilized to streamline this process. The results of these studieswill form the basis for the first defined human SNP map and generate theresources necessary to conduct genome wide association studies.

1311,PyrosequencingÃ¢\x80\x9c or real time sequencing is a fast and accurate methodfor SNP analysis. Pyrosequencing AB (Sweden) manufactures thePSQ96Ã¢\x80\x9c System in which 96 dif ferent SNPs are analyzed in parallel in approximately 10 min. A dedicated SNP scoring software automaticallydelivers genotype and a quality assessment for each sample. In this study the applicability of pyrosequencing for multiplex genotyping was investi gated. SNPs from the Renin Angiotensinogen Aldosterone System(RAAS) were analyzed using pooled simplex PCR products followed bymultiplex genotyping. To further enhance cost efficiency in SNP analysis multiplex PCR followed by multiplex genotyping by pyrosequencing wastested using the Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin G20210A polymor phisms. The flexibility offered by pyrosequencing with respect to position ing of the sequencing primer relative to the SNP was exploited in experi mental design of multiplex genotyping. Both strategies (pooled simplexPCR/multiplex pyrosequencing and multiplex PCR/multiplex pyrosequenc ing) resulted in highly reproducible and accurate SNP scores which werein complete accordance with those obtained when genotyping each frag ment independently. Design of sequencing primers in combination with areaction specific dispensation order enabled separate typing of the SNPpositions whilst keeping the genotyping quality identical to that of simplexgenotyping. In addition this approach allowed some unequal amplificationefficiency to occur without negatively effecting the genotyping results. Thesequences surrounding the SNPs confirmed the correct positioning of the primers on their respective gene sequences. Thus pyrosequencingenables reliable and robust analysis of several SNPs in a single pyrose quencing reaction.

1312, erlangen.deInter individual genomic variability is mainly due to single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNP) and variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR). Bothkinds of variability are elevated in the genomic region of the protein phos phatase regulatory subunit gene PPP2R3L compared to the average poly morphism rate in the whole genome. The human PPP2R3L gene is locat ed in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) on human sex chromosomesXp and Yp 150 kbp from the telomer. The elevated variability of thePPP2R3L gene region is most likely caused by the exceptional features ofPAR1. The increased recombination rate within the PAR1 and a GC con tent of 60 % both are supposed to increase the SNP rate whereas slippageand illegitimate recombination alter the number of tandem repeats. Corre lations between genomic environment and polymorphism rate were inves tigated by comparing the variability of the PPP2R3L region with thegenomic region of the closely related autosomal PPP2R3 gene. ,2001
1313,Kruglyak (1999) and others have cautioned against the use of LD (LinkageDisequilibrium) mapping in the general human population because of theprohibitive number of markers required to map genes. However the den sity of markers required for LD mapping is much reduced in a populationthat is sufficiently young. Suppose we have a population of age approxi mately 6 8 generations. This type of population allows the use ofmicrosatellite markers instead of SNPs for LD mapping which are knownto be more informative. However in order to use such a young populationit is imperative to have a representative sample of individuals. Otherwiseindividuals in the sample are more distantly related and LD is unlikely to bedetected. Here we outline two strategies to identify people who are dis tantly related by 6 8 generations. One is a simple method based on theaverage IBD sharing of individuals and the other is a multipoint approachlooking at the average length of segment shared by individuals. We try themethods on some simulated data as well as on some real data from Tas mania Australia s island state. ,2001
1314,"Feder et al. (1996) used $p_{\\rm excess}$ and $F$ which is based onHardy Weinberg disequilibrium to study hereditary hemochromatosis(HH) and located the hereditary hemochromatosis gene to a genomicregion $<$1 2 cM. $$F=\\frac{H_0 H_e}{1 H_e}$$ where $H_0$ is theobserved frequency of homozygosity and $H_0$ is the expected homozy gosity assuming Hardy Weinberg equilibrium among cases. We prove that$F_M$ needs to be improved and it is possible that the value of $F_M$ atone marker locus is larger than that at another marker locus and the latteris closer to the disease susceptibility locus. The reason of the inadequateperformance of $F_M$ is that $F_M$ depends on the allele frequency of$M$. If the allele frequencies at different markers are different which isusually the case the maximum of $F_M$ will not occur at the disease sus ceptibility locus. We propose a new measure of fine scale mapping $J$ which is a modified version of $\\hat F_M$. Our new measure does notdepend on marker allele frequencies and its maximum occurs at the dis ease locus. We do not need to assume a single ancestral haplotype. Assuming multiple ancestral haplotypes we prove that $p_{\\rm excess}$is not a good measure of fine scale mapping because it depends on mark er allele frequencies. In theory our new measure is better than both $F_M$and $p_{\\rm excess}$. In simulations our new measure outperforms $F$and $p_{\\rm excess}$ for all disease models.

Accurate Estimation of Both Haplotype Frequencies and Phase of Each Subject Using Multilocus Genotypic Datafrom Unrelated Individuals Using EM Algorithm based Pro gram Y. Kitamura1 M. Saito1 A. Saito1 H. Akama1 H. Morisaki2 T. Morisaki2 N. Kamatani1 1Institute of Rheumatology Tokyo Women s Medical University Tokyo Japan 2National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute Osaka Japan ', 'Haplotype analysis is becoming increasingly important for mapping dis ease genes. Usually exact haplotypes are considered to be obtained onlyfrom pedigree data. Recently however methods for estimating the fre quencies of the haplotypes from the genotypic data of unrelated individu als have been developed based on expectation maximization (EM) algo rithm. The previous study has suggested that the estimation of the samplefrequencies of the haplotypes was accurate when the simulation data wereanalyzed. We examined whether the EM based haplotype frequency esti mation and the estimation of phases of unrelated subjects are accurateusing the real data on smoothelin gene. Using the DHPLC and SSCPmethods on PCR amplified DNA we were able to determine the haplo types for 2 separate regions spanning 341 380 bp sequences in thesmoothelin gene for 96 unrelated subjects (32 Japanese 32 EuropeanAmerican and 32 African American). After physically determining the hap lotypes we concealed the phases and applied the genotypic data to ourEM algorithm based program. Our program estimates both haplotype fre quencies and the probability distribution on the phases of the subjects andcan handle both biallelic and multiallelic loci. When the data from the 3groups were applied separately the program almost perfectly estimatedthe sample haplotype frequencies as well as the phases in the subjects. Mis estimation rate was almost negligible. Although the present methodshould be tested for the cases where haplotypes span much wider regionsof the chromosome our data suggest that the results of the EM basedhaplotype frequency and phase estimation from the data of unrelated indi viduals may be quite reliable for the data from various ethnic groups.

1315,In a linkage study of a disease it is important to know if the number of pedi grees that investigators have collected or plan to collect will be sufficient todetect linkage. Computer simulation of the genotypes in pedigrees is aneffective method that can provide approximate answers to such questions. However with the previous simulation programs based on the basic algo rithm used in the LINKAGE package it was difficult to simulate genotypesat more than a handful of loci. To investigate complex diseases multipointanalysis with many markers will be crucial and it is necessary to simulategenotypes at large numbers of loci. In this study we have developed a newcomputer program to simulate genotypes quickly at many loci with gener al Monte Carlo method and inheritance vector. Inheritance vector is a bina ry vector that describes the outcome of the patermal and maternal meios es giving rise to the nonfounders in the pedigree at every locus in thegenome which can indicate the precise inheritance pattern of the pedi gree. Using inheritance vector our program can simulate genotypes atmany trait or marker loci quickly in a standalone linux environment and thatsupports efficient multipoint analysis of pedigree data. ,2001
1316,Data with varying age at disease onset arise frequently in studies of map ping disease genes for complex traits. In our earlier paper (Li and Hsu 2000 Annals of Human Genetics in press) we show that naively combin ing affected subjects with different ages at onset may result in a muchreduced power in detecting linkage. Based on this observation in thispaper we propose a weighted generalized score test statistic where theproposed weighting depends on a specified age dependent penetrancefunction and on the observed age at onset in affected family members. Thelarge sample theory shows that the proposed weighted test has a correcttype I error rate even if the penetrance function is misspecified. It is shownanalytically that under the Cox proportional hazards model for the majorgene effects the weighted test statistic gains more power than the one giv ing equal weights to all affected subjects and that under or over mis specification of mode of inheritance and relative risk do not appear to affectthe power greatly. As for illustration we apply the proposed test to a simu lated data set provided by the 12th Genetic Analysis Workshop organizers. It shows that the proposed test statistic yields strong evidence for theregion where the underlying disease loci reside whereas the equal weighttest statistic provides only modest evidence for the same region and yetindicates a strong signal to the location which is far away from the truelocations. ,2001
1317,The genetic dissection of disorders of complex inheritance requires large scale genotyping of SNPs. A number of methods have been developed forefficient and fast genotyping. Some of these methods e.g. using polarisa tion and mass spectrometry require expensive equipment and are notsuited for small to medium sized laboratories. Primer extension with fluo rescently labelled ddNTPs can be performed on the more widely availableautomated sequencers. Here we report a variation of this method which wefind more reliable and cheaper. We use extension primers labelled with 3different dyes (FAM HEX and TET). We designed our own size standardsranging from 13 to 43 bp labelled with TAMRA. The 3 end of the primer extends not immediately up to the SNP but one bp earlier. This reducesthe interference of the first extension peak with the peak produced by theprimer which has not incorporated any d/ddNTP. We use 3 dNTPs and 1ddNTP for each reaction so that the primer extends between 1 and 5 bpbeyond the SNP until it reaches the next ddNTP site. This produces 3peaks which allow unambiguous calling of genotypes. The presence of apeak produced by the non extended primer in each reaction allows to dis tinguish failed reactions and provides an internal size control. Out of 8reactions we produced reliable traces in 7 with our first attempt and hadto change the ddNTP in the last reaction to the alternative ddNTP. Usingdifferent sizes of primers ranging from 15 to 31 bp we were able to multi plex all 8 SNP for analysis on the same gel. The cost of an individual geno typing is $0.42 excluding the cost of primers. We also perfomed pooledDNA genotyping of these 8 SNPs on pools of 110 parent offspring trios. One reaction did not produce reliable traces because of interference withthe peak of the non extended primer. One SNP had an allele with a verylow frequency of 2% and could not be measured reliably. The remaining 6SNPs showed highly reproducible patterns with a maximum variationbetween experiments of just 2.8%. Analysis of pooled and individual geno typings showed a maximum error of 1.4% for the true versus the predicteddifference between two sets of pools. We conclude that the method is suf ficiently accurate to be used as an initial screen in order to reduce the num ber of SNPs that justify individual genotyping.

1318,"A variety of methods may be used to characterize and to screen singlenucleotide polymorphisms. Analysis platforms include microarray scan ning real time PCR analysis (TaqMan) and MALDI TOF. In addition elec trophoresis based techniques include OLA analysis dideoxy sequencing and single nucleotide primer extension. SNaPshot is a single tube SNEreaction designed for elucidation of individual loci within known sequencecontexts for the purpose of SNP screening and validation. We describe thedevelopment of a short size standard for analyzing small fragments on flu orescent detection systems. This standard contains 9 fragments rangingfrom 15 to 120 nucleotides and is labeled with a fifth dye. During evalua tion on various capillary electrophoresis platforms we are able to achieveexcellent precision and curve fitting cross platform. The fifth dye is spec trally well resolved from other dyes. This size standard is designed in par ticular to enable automated data analysis in methods for SNP detection such as single nucleotide extension assays. In our poster we will demon strate its utility in SNE assays.

We detected 11 novel SNPs and a 50 bp deletion. The twocommonest SNPs were genotyped in 1100 individuals and we found thattheir allele frequencies were at great variance from Hardy Weinberg equa tion (chi squared values of 45 and 85). Six primer pairs were used to gen erate PCR products ranging from 150 to 1 200 bp and genotyping byrestriction digest and direct sequencing gave identical results excluding anartefactual explanation. Transmission of the SNPs within CEPH pedigreesdemonstrated Mendelian and non Mendelian SNP inheritance patternswithin the same PCR product. Conversion was bidirectional from T>C andC>T and dependant on the presence of at least one parental T allele. Transmission frequencies observed in this study for non Mendelian SNPsare consistent with a population genetics model leading to a stable poly morphism. These events are not explicable by our current ideas of muta genesis such as methylation and deamination of cytosine residues andsuggest that SNP conversion occurs as a novel genomic editing eventaffecting both parental chromatids. Sites of SNP instability may significant ly impact on research that assumes genomic stability and heritability ofhuman SNPs. ",2001
1319,We have further developed and improved a method for high throughputSNP genotyping on the MegaBACEÃ¢\x80\x9c 1000. The system takes advantage of the instrument s flexibility to load multiple 96 well sample plates over ashort period using a proprietary method of repeated time spaced injec tions. Samples are prepared in a single tube SNuPEÃ¢\x80\x9c (Single NucleotidePrimer Extension) reaction that contains four different fluorescently labeleddideoxynucleotides (terminators). After single base extension and cleanup SNP products are loaded onto the MegaBACE by automated electrokinet ic injection. Multiple pulsed injections of up to 10 30 different SNP markerplates are then loaded into the same polymer matrix spaced at two minuteelectrophoresis intervals. 1000 3000 SNP genotypes can be obtainedwith a time range of approximately 2 5 hours further color and size multi plexing will greatly increase throughput. A characteristic injection marker isadded to each sample prior to injection acting both as internal control andalso demarcating each injection from the next. A separate software pack age SNP Profiler automatically processes the signal data and outputs themaximum likelihood SNP genotypes. The flexibility of the system is demon strated by the ability of switching between three applications highthroughput sequencing SNP typing or STR genotyping in minutes. ,2001
1320,Positive crossover interference has been documented in many organismsincluding both human and mouse (Zhao et al. 1995). The amount of inter ference appears to vary throughout the genome. QTL analysis and genet ic map estimation are usually carried out under the assumption of nocrossover interference. However taking crossover interference intoaccount creates more accurate genetic maps especially in the presence ofmissing or erroneous data. The genome averaged level of interference haspreviously been estimated for mice. We fit a chi square model for interfer ence to each individual chromosome for various sets of mouse data. Thechi square model has been found to fit data from experimental organismswell (Lin and Speed 1996). We estimate m the level of interference foreach chromosome. We also investigate if there is a significant difference inthe level of interference between the sexes. nan,2001
1321,An insertion deletion polymorphism of the angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE) gene has been shown to be associated with levels of ACE. BecauseACE is heavily expressed in the lungs and plays a key role in the metabo lism of angiotensin II and bradykinin which are potentially involved in thepathogenesis of asthma. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is apotent modulator of immune and inflammatory responses and has beenimplicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases including asthma. Interindividual variation in TNF alpha levels may be genetically determinedand polymorphisms (G A 238 and 308) within the TNF alpha genes andnearby HLA Class II region have been associated with differences is TNFalpha production. In the present study we examined whether asthma islinked with these ACE and TNF alpha genes polymorphism. Patients withasthma (n=120 74 males and 46 females age 11.22 Ã¢\x80\x93 3.69) and 52healthy controls were determined for their genotype by the polymerasechain reaction (PCR) method. Fourty six asthmatics demonstrated the DDtype (38.3%) 52 the DI type (43.4%) and 22 the II type (18.3%). The ACEgene polymorphism (D/I) did not show on association (odds= 0.65 % 95CI 0 67 Ã¢\x80\x942 33 X2= 1 99 p>0 005). The allelic frequency of the TNF alpha G A 238 among the asthma patients was not significantly different fromamong the control subjects. However TNF alpha G A 308 allele was pres ent at significantly higher frequency in cases than control (odds= 2 42 %95 CI 1 7 3 42 p<0 005). No significant differences were evident in serumIgE levels allergic and non allergic asthma patients among the three geno types. The ACE (D/I) polymorphism is not associated with asthma in thispopulation. We conclude that the TNF alpha G A Ã¢\x80\x94308 polymorphism may form of the genetic predisposition to asthma. ,2001
1322,Asthma is a complex genetic disorder largely attributed to the interactionsof the environment and multiple genes each potentially having relativelysmall effects. Several genes that map to chromosome 5q31 35 have beenassociated with asthma. While these genes are highly polymorphic no SNPis found to play a major role in asthma. This study addressed the hypoth esis that specific series of SNPs within several genes at this locus may beassociated with asthma. Thirteen SNPs were examined in 9 genes at the5q31 35 locus in 94 asthmatic patients and 91 controls by sequencing. Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism 343The patients phenotype was characterized by skin tests PFTÃÂ«s and metha choline challenge tests. The genotypes are denoted as MM Mm and mm wherein M and m represent the major and minor allele frequencies respectively. The analyses were based on the Hardy Weinberg law andchi square tests. No dominant series of genotypes was detected thatextended to all nine genes. However we observed significant correlationbetween the combinations of the MM and mm genotypes in 4 locationswithin the IL 13 gene (p<0.0001) but no differences were detectedbetween patients and controls. Linkage disequilibrium was also observedbetween the SNP s in the IL 13 and IL 4 genes and to a lesser degreebetween the IL 4 and IL 3 genes. Taken together these observationsdemonstrate that specific genotypes in the IL 3 IL 4 and IL 13 genes arein marked linkage disequilibrium however their relevance to asthmaremains uncertain. We are currently searching for possible associations ofmulti locus genotypes with asthma in a larger cohort. ,2001
1323,We examined 46 cases of human sporadic colon cancer and correspon ding normal tissue samples to evaluate the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) atthe APC gene loci. DNAs were used for PCR RFLP VNTR and LOHanalysis. To analyze LOH at the APC gene loci we used five polymorficmarkers three RFLP intragenic markers (exon 11 RsaI exon 15 MspI andexon 15 AspHI) and two VNTR flanking markers (D5S409 and D5S433).The informativity for all three intragenic RFLP markers was 50.0 % (23 of46 assayed) and 21.7 % of tumors (5 of 23 informative) demonstratedLOH. The informativity for VNTR flanking markers D5S409 and D5S433was 60.9 % (28 of 46 asseyed) and 87.0 % (40 of 46 asseyed) respec tively. Eight of 28 informative tumors (28.6 %) demonstrated LOH for mark er D5S409 and 14 of 40 informative tumors (35.0%) demonstrated LOHfor marker D5S433. The informativity for all five APC loci was 100 % and14 of 46 tumors ( 30.4 %) demonstrated LOH. Our study showed that itwas necessary to use VNTR flanking markers D5S409 and D5S433 toincrease the number of informative cases (from 50 % with intragenic mark ers) to 100 %. The highest informativity was observed for VNTR markerD5S433 87 %. nan,2001
1324,Osteoporosis is a disease associated to low bone mineral density (BMD)that has been described to be mostly under genetic control. Several can didate genes have been reported to be linked or associated to osteoporo sis or related phenotypes. We collected 120 families (547 individuals 180sibships) through an osteoporotic subject. All families had at least 2 sibs and parents when possible. All the individuals were phenotyped for BMD at 7 sites. We now report a linkage study of AluI polymorphism T1377C inthe calcitonin receptor gene (CTR) with bone mineral density measured at2 sites (femoral neck and Ward triangle) or with body mass index (BMI).Families were studied with non parametric linkage and transmission dise quilibrium test methods. C allele frequency was 30%. Genotypes were inHardy Weinberg equilibrium. Sib pair analysis showed linkage withfemoral neck density (p=0.036) and BMI (p=0.038). Linkage was notobserved at Ward triangle site even if the result was close to the signifi cance threshold (p=0.06). TDT was performed by setting as affected thesubjectes with a Z score < 1. No preferential allele transmission to affect ed individuals was observed. Due to the low information content of thepolymorphism (PIC=0.33) individuals will be further genotyped with DNAmarkers mapping close to CTR gene in order to increase the number ofinformative families. In conclusion the calcitonin receptor gene or a close ly located gene might be associated to bone mineral density in the Italianpopulation. ,2001

1326,Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease forms a group of heterogeneous dis orders of the peripheral nervous system the main feature of which is distalweakness and wasting in the limbs associated to other neurological man ifestations mainly affecting sensation reflexes and muscle tone. CMT isthe most common peripheral nerve disorder with an estimated frequencyof 1 in 2 500. It may be inherited in an autosomal dominant an autosomalrecessive or an X linked mode. There are two physiopathological types ofCMT the demyelinating type characterised by decreased motor nerveconduction velocities (MNCV) and primarily affecting the myelin and theaxonal type characterised by normal or slightly reduced MNCVs and pri marily affects the axon. The two types may be distinguished based on neu rophysiological and neuropathological criteria. One autosomal recessiveaxonal CMT locus has thus far been mapped on chromosome 1q21.2 q21.3 but the corresponding gene has yet to be identified. We selected a344 Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphismgroup of seven autosomal recessive axonal CMT families that were previ ously characterised at the clinical neurophysiological and neuropathologi cal levels for further molecular genetic studies. Forty seven individuals fif teen of them affected were included in the study. These individuals weregenotyped at marker loci spanning the known CMT loci. Families wereanalysed for linkage at these known CMT loci and slightly positive resultswere further evaluated by haplotype analysis. Three of the seven families(one Cypriot and two Polish families) linked to demyelinating autosomalrecessive CMT loci. ,2001
1327,Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy (CMT) is a heterogeneous group of dis orders of the peripheral nervous system with a broad spectrum of clinicalseverity and different pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant CMT isclassified into two forms based on neuropathological criteria. CMT1 ischaracterized by de and remyelination while CMT2 exhibits axonaldegeneration. Genetic studies have shown that CMT2 is genetically het erogeneous. Several CMT2 loci have been identified on chromosome1p35 p36 (CMT2A) chromosome 3q13 q22 (CMT2B) and chromosome7p14 (CMT2D). A fourth CMT2 type (CMT2C) was not linked to any locus. Recently the Neurofilament Light (NF L) gene was found responsible for anew CMT2 type (CMT2E) localized on chromosome 8p21. Point mutationsin the Myelin Protein Zero (MPZ) gene were found in some CMT2 familiesas well. In this study we report a genetic study on a large CMT2 familyfrom Turkey. Linkage analysis was performed by using a number of mark ers mapping to the CMT2A CMT2B and CMT2D loci to the MPZ locus onchromosome 1q22 23 and within the NF L gene. Lod scores have exclud ed the association of the disease in this family with any of the CMT2 loci suggesting the presence of an additional CMT2 locus to be identified. ,2001
1328,We describe a Swiss family in which four of eight sibs show severe retinalchanges early onset myopia maligna excessive posterior staphyloma andpresenile cataract. There was no evidence for myopia or another ophthal mological disease in the parents of the eight siblings or in one of the overthirty children. The posterior staphyloma clearly differentiates this vitreo retinal degeneration from other previous described ones. The mode ofinheritance in this family with only one affected generation and both affect ed males and females is likely to be autosomal recessive. The hithertounknown phenotype of the disease (implicating very rare occurence) andthe origin of the parents from adjacent villages are compatible with a hid den consanguinity in this family. Therefore homozygosity mappingseemed to be a promising approach to localize the causative gene in thisfamily. In the case of a recessive disease in a consanguineous pedigree the region surrounding the disease locus is assumed to be identical bydescent in affected persons. In contrast in unaffected members this regionshould not be identical by descent. More than 500 microsatellite markersdistributed over the entire genome were investigated and have lead to theidentification of a 12cM homozygous region. A candidate gene encoding aprotein of the extracellular matrix was analysed by DHPLC analysis. Untilnow only polymorphisms and no mutations in this gene have been identi fied in several members of this family. ,2001
1329,Type 1 diabetes (IDDM) is an autoimmune disorder resulting from destruc tion of the pancreatic islet cells with the major susceptibility gene in HLAregion on chromosome 6p21. IDDM is accompanying with Addison s dis ease in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndromes (APS) appearing asa common clinical phenotype in APS2 and a rare phenotype in APS1 which is only described autoimmune endocrine disease with Mendelianinheritance. The gene responsible for APS1 AIRE (autoimmune regulator) has been identified on chromosome 21q22.3 by positional cloning andcharacterised as a transcriptional activator. IDDM and APS1 are enrichedin Finnish population. We have designed a DNA chip with AIRE sequencepolymorphisms and mutations searching for allelic variants associated withIDDM and estimated the allele frequencies and heterozygosities for 11SNP s nine out of them from AIRE coding region in 120 patients withPosters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism 345IDDM and 135 controls from Finnish population. We used APEX technolo gy for identification of different types of sequence alterations. APEX is aresequencing method based on two dimensional array of oligonucleotides immobilised via 5 end on a glass surface. The PCR amplified and enzy matically digested DNA template is annealed to immobilised primers which promote sites for template dependent DNA polymerase extensionreactions using four fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides. The Geno ramaÃ¢\x80\x9c imaging system and genotyping software is used for data analysis. We have found five SNPs to be polymorphic with heterozygosity indexbetween 0.2 0.5. Three polymorphic SNPs could be considered as mark ers of preference for association/LD studies in IDDM patients. The mostcommon APS1 mutations R257X and 13 bp deletion in exon 8 showed noevidence for linkage to IDDM in the population studied. ,2001
1330,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease that results inthe destruction of the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP based candidate gene analysis in regionswith evidence of linkage to T1DM is proving to be instrumental in discov ering variants of genes involved in the pathogenesis and/or regulation ofthis disease. Delta 1 is a human transmembrane notch ligand that hasrecently been fully characterized and mapped to the IDDM8 regionbetween microsatellite markers D6S446 and D6S281 (Oda et al. unpub lished data) showing significant LD transmission in T1DM patients(T=58.2 68.1% P<0.05 Owerbach 2000). The Delta 1 Notch pathwaymay play a role in induction of peripheral tolerance. We identified 3 newSNPs within the Delta1 gene and carried out initial association analysis for2 SNPs using 384 affected T1DM cases from HBDI repository and 192matched controls. We found significant association for one intronic SNP inthe T1DM population located 47bp away from the GT donor splice site ofexon 4 (P<0.023). We will confirm this association with a TDT analysis ofover 200 singleton families from Australia. An SNP located in the 3 UTRregion showed no frequency differences in cases vs. controls. The thirdSNP located in the promoter has not been examined for association yet but we have determined in silico that this polymorphism is present in aputative binding site for the transcription factor AP 2 thus potentially affect ing the transcriptional regulation of Delta1.

1331,Setleis Syndrome is a form of ectodermal dysplasia (Facial Dermal Dys plasia MIM 227260) first described in 1963 in Puerto Rican patients thatmoved to New York from the town of San Sebasti n. This syndrome ischaracterized by bilateral temporal marks similar to forceps marks anaged leonine appearance puckered skin about the eyes absent eyelash es on both lids or multiple rows on the upper lids and none on the lowerlids a nose and chin that felt rubbery and eyebrows that slant sharply upward. Subsequent reports in the literature have described affectedpatients in Germany Japan and Oman. We have identified several familieswith children affected with Setleis Syndrome in Puerto Rico as well as fromanother family in Oman. DNA analysis of candidate gene regions usingvarious loci implicated in other ectodermal dysplasias (1q32 44 2q11 13 3q27 11q23 q24 and 13q12) and a region in chromosome 1 recently pro posed to be a possible locus for the Setleis Syndrome gene (1p36) wascarried out by genotyping with STR markers (Marshfield). We observedmarkedly increased allele frequencies and allele sharing or homozygosityfor marker GATA48B01 at locus D1S1660 when compared to normalPuerto Rican controls. This marker lies close to the plakophilin 1 gene which has been associated with ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility syn drome. Identification of the Setleis Syndrome gene may permit under standing the pathogenesis and permit prenatal diagnosis of this rare dis order in the Puerto Rican population.

It is acommon cause of pain affecting up to 5% of the population. Although it isoften regarded as being caused predominantly by external factors manypatients report complaints of CDH in their family members. The neuro transmitter serotonin (5 HT) play a major role in the regulation of pain inthe central nervous system and therefore may be involved in pathophysi ology of CDH. In this study we performed a genetic association analysis toverify whether the 5 HT genes contribute to the risk of CDH. Polymor phisms in the genes coding for 5 HT2A 5 HT2C 5 HT6 receptors and 5 HT transporter (h SERT) were investigated in a sample of 105 patientswith CDH and 92 healthy control subjects all coming from the same geo graphical area. No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencieswere found in the patients compared to the controls for any of the investi gated polymorphisms. These data indicate that serotonin genes studied donot contribute to the genetic predisposition to CHD. ,2001
1333,The serotonin transporter (5 HTT) of the brain mediates sodium depend ent presynaptic reuptake of serotonin and has great importance for modu lating serotonine function. The SLC6A4 locus encoding this protein mapsto chromosome 17q11.1 17q12. It spans 31 kb and consists of 14 exons. A functional polymorphism (5 HTTLPR) located in the proximal 5 regula tory region is a repetitive sequence with different allelic transcriptional effi ciencies (transcriptional activity of the long variant is more than twice thatof the short). A second polymorphism found in intron 2 (Stin2 system) andconsisting of a VNTR of 17 bp segment might have an indipendent role ininfluencing the stability of transcription complexes. We performed an asso ciation study to elucidate the role of the serotonin transporter gene as asusceptibility factor for Parkinson s disease (PD). A comparison of poly morphic regions of the serotonine transporter gene was carried out in 315patients with PD. Diagnosis of PD was carried out according to the UKBrain Bank criteria among outpatients attending the Institute of Neurologyat the University of Catanzaro. The control group included 185 healthy sub jects from the same geographic area (Calabria Ã¢\x80\x94 Southern Italy). No dif ference was found between allele or genotype frequency in the patientscompared to the controls as regard the examined polymorphisms. Thisfindings indicate that the investigated polymorphisms of the serotoninetransporter gene are unlikely to play a role in genetic predisposition toParkinson s disease. ,2001
1334,The objective of this study is to identify genetic loci linked to Parkinson dis ease (PD) in multiplex (more than one family member diagnosed with PDand available for study) families. Data from family twin and epidemiolog ic studies suggest that the etiology of PD is complex and comprised ofgenetic and environmental factors. Genes responsible for early onset autosomal dominant PD (alpha synuclein) and juvenile onset autosomalrecessive parkinsonism (parkin) have been recently identified. However additional genes particularly for the more common late onset familial formof PD remain to be discovered. We studied 174 Caucasian multiplex (2 ormore sampled PD patients) families [containing 870 sampled members(378 affected) 185 sampled affected sibling pairs and 70 other sampledaffected relative pairs] ascertained as part of a multi center genetic linkagestudy. Mean age at onset was 59.9Ã¢\x80\x9312.6 years. Diagnosis of PD wasbased on the presence of two of the following signs tremor at rest bradyki nesia and rigidity as well as the absence of atypical features and othercauses of parkinsonism. A clinical adjudication board reviewed all cases forconsistency across sites. Marker genotypes were obtained on 344microsatellite markers (average spacing 10 cM). Families were studied forlinkage using a multi analytical approach consisting of two point paramet ric (MLOD) and multipoint non parametric (LOD*) methods. To identifypotential genetic heterogeneity by age at onset 18 families having at leastone family member with onset prior to age 40 were considered separatelyfrom the remaining late onset families (n=156). Six regions generated interesting lod scores. The strongest results overall (MLOD or LOD* > 2)were obtained for markers on chromosomes 5q 8p 9q and 17p 17q. Additional regions of interest (MLOD or LOD* > 1.5) were 14q and Xq. Results in the late onset subset were similar to those obtained overall. Incontrast analysis of the 18 early onset families detected significant evi dence for linkage to chromosome 6q (MLOD and LOD* > 5) in the vicinityof the parkin gene. We conclude that several loci provide interesting link age results in our family sample. Strong linkage of early onset PD familiesto the region on 6q containing parkin supports its involvement in familialPD. Regions of interest on 5q 8q 9q and 17 have been prioritized for fol low up and evaluation of positional and functional candidate genes inthese regions is underway. ,2001
1335,NACP/alpha Synuclein gene is located on human chromosome 4q21 23.Missense mutations are responsible for rare forms of autosomal dominantParkinson (PD). The protein encoded by this gene has also been demon strated in Lewy bodies of sporadic PD suggesting that it may play a cru cial role in a final common pathway. The exact mechanism by whichNACP/alpha Synuclein protein plays a role in neuronal degeneration isunclear. Variability in the NACP/alpha Synuclein gene could lead to theaberration in the proteolytic pathway with following protein aggregation. We investigated a polymorphic dinucleotide repeat in the promoter regionof the NACP/alpha Synuclein gene in 197 PD patients from Southern Italyand 182 healthy control subjects matched for age sex and geographicalorigin. Four different alleles ranging from 265 bp to 271 bp were identified. Allele frequencies were computed by counting genes from the observedgenotypes. We did not find statistically significant differences in theNACP/alpha Synuclein genotypes between the patients with PD and thecontrol group (chi square 3.272 df 5 p 0.658). In contrast to our findings Kruger et al. 99 showed a significantly higher frequency of the 267 bp allele(1 allele) in PD patients than in controls. Our results thus provide furtherevidence that the variation within the NACP/alpha Synuclein gene doesnot play an important role in the etiology of PD. ,2001
1336,"Bipolar affective disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder with a high preva lence and substantial morbidity and mortality. Strong support for the role ofgenetic factors in the aetiology comes from twin family and adoption stud ies. We have been conducting a genome wide search for susceptibilitygenes in a set of 75 families with bipolar affective disorder from Germany Italy and Israel comprising 136 affected sib pairs and including a total of444 individuals. Clinical assessment of subjects included a SADS L inter view by trained interviewers and review of all available clinical records andfamily history information. DSMIII R was used as the main diagnostic sys tem. Inclusion criteria for the systematically ascertained BP families wereone proband with BPI a secondary affected sib with either BPI BPII SA/BP or UPR and availability of both parents. If either parent wasunavailable unaffected sibs of the proband were collected. Genotypingwas undertaken using fluorescent semiautomated technology using a mapof 394 microsatellite markers at an average spacing of ca. 9.1 cM. Linkageanalyses were performed using LINKAGE GAS and GENEHUNTER.

CittadellaInstitute of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology National ResearchCouncil Cosenza I', 'Genetic susceptibility to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is determined by manypartially identified genes each having a modest effect but together forminga major determinant of disease. The cytokine network with its prominentrole in immune and inflammatory responses can be considered a poten tial factor of considerable importance. Interleukin (IL) 1alpha and 1beta aretwo proinflammatory cytokines involved in the formation of MS lesions. TheIL1 receptor antagonist (IL 1RA) is a protein structurally related to IL 1beta that effectively inhibits the proinflammatory effects of IL 1. To ana lyze the contribution of IL alpha IL 1beta and IL 1RA genes in the genet ics predisposition to MS we have examined four polymorphic geneticmarkers in 85 Italian patients with clinically definite MS and 130 healthycontrols. No significant differences in genotypic and allelic frequencieswere found between MS patients and healthy controls. Our results suggestthat these polymorphisms do not contribute to the genetic susceptibility toMS . ",2001
1337,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder characterized by inflam matory demyelination of the CNS. Multiple studies have suggested agenetic component to MS and genome wide scans have revealed sever al putative susceptibility loci. In the genetically isolated Finnish population four main candidate regions have been identified The HLA locus on chro mosome 6 the MBP locus on chromosome 18 and two relatively wideregions on chromosomes 5p14 p12 and 17q22 q24 which are syntenic tothe murine Eae loci 2 and 7 respectively. By using radiation hybrid map ping FISH and web based approaches we have further characterized thecritical regions on chromosomes 5 and 17. We have analyzed a denser setof markers between D5S432 and D5S2061 (20 cM) on chromosome 5 andbetween D17S956 and D17S2182 (25 cM) on chromosome 17 in theFinnish multiplex families. Supportive evidence for linkage was obtainedfor both regions. Markers D5S1992 and D17S1825 gave the highest pair wise LODs (4.08 and 3.42 respectively) and both Genehunter andSimwalk2 multipoint analysis programs further restricted these putative MSloci. The subset of families originating from Southern Bothnia an internalisolate on the Western coast of Finland with a higher prevalence of MS provided most information for the chromosome 17 locus. Forty singletonfamilies originating from the Southern Bothnia region as well as addition al 119 trios from other parts of Finland have been genotyped for the bestmarkers but no significant association with MS could be detected. We arenow analyzing 126 intragenic SNPs in positional candidate genes. Bycombining the information from the microsatellite markers and the SNPswe will monitor for allelic association and shared haplotypes in the FinnishMS alleles. ,2001
1338,Essential tremor (ET) is a chronic neurological condition which may beregarded as the most common movement disorder in human. The mainfeature of ET is postural tremor of the arms but the head legs trunk voice jaw and facial muscles may be involved as well. ET can be eithersporadic or familial (familial essential tremor FET or ETM). In addition theprevalence of Parkinson s disease and dystonia may be increased in fam ilies with ET. Autosomal dominant inheritance can be demonstrated in mostfamilies and two ET loci have been mapped on chromosomes 3q13(ETM1 MIM 190300) and 2p25 p22 (ETM2 MIM 602134) respectively. Here we report on a large Moroccan family with isolated autosomal domi nant ET. Interestingly patients presented with a very early onset. They aremainly affected with fine rapid ET of both hands and arms. We testedmicrosatellites DNA markers at the ETM1 and ETM2 loci and eventually excluded linkage to both regions suggesting further genetic heterogeneityof FET. Furthermore the Parkinson s loci mapping to chromosomes 4 and6 were also excluded. Ongoing gene mapping studies will hopefully shedligh on the genetic variability of ET. ,2001
1339, erlangen.deCharcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) a group of hereditary motor sensoryneuropathies (HMSN) is a clinically and genetically heterogenous disorderof the peripheral nervous system. Clinically CMT is divided into a demyeli nating type 1 (CMT1) characterized by reduced nerve conduction veloci ties (NCV<38m/s) and an axonal type 2 with almost normal NCV (CMT2).We have studied a Costa Rican family with 18 affected members withautosomal recessive nan,2001
1340,Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HPS) is a heterogeneous group of inherit ed disorders of the motor system characterized by progressive lower extremity spasticity and weakness. Clinically HPS is classified as pureform if neurologic impairment solely affects the legs and complicatedform if additional symptoms such as mental retardation ataxia epilepsy optic atrophy and peripheral neuropathy are present. The pure form ofHSP is most commonly inherited as autosomal dominant trait althoughfamilies with an autosomal recessive or with an X linked mode of inheri tance have also been described. Genetic loci for HSP are designed spas tic gait (SPG) loci. To date seven SPG loci responsible for pure HSP havebeen described SPG4 (2p22) SPG13 (2q24 q34) SPG8 (8q23 24) SPG3 (14q11 q21) SPG10 (12q13) SPG6 (15q11.1) and SPG12 (19q13).Only one gene at the SPG4 locus designed spastin has been identified. In this study we report a large pedigree with a pure form of HSP fromSouthern Italy. A total of 35 subjects were studied. Eleven members werefound to be affected. The clinical picture was uniform in the affected mem bers and characterized by spastic gait as prominent sign in all symptomaticpatients with a variable degree of severity. The hypertonia of the lowerlimbs was associated with moderate spasticity at rest and normal or slight 348 Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphismly impaired muscle power. Using nine microsatellite markers located on chromosome 14 linkage to chromosome 14 was detected. The moleculardata confirm as previously reported the mapping of the SPG3 locus in aregion flanked by D14S75 and D14S1031. ,2001
1341,AlzheimerÃÂ«s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia occurringin the later decades of life. The only risk gene that has been indisputablyshown to associate with AD is the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE)gene. In addition to APOE other polymorphic genes are likely to operateas risk factors in late onset AD (LOAD). We have studied the role of thepolymorphism in three different genes that have been implicated in LOAD. The studied polymorphism were the insertion/deletion polymorphism ofdipeptidyl carboxypeptidase 1 (ACE) gene the PvuII and XbaI polymor phisms of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) gene and the C to T transitionpolymorphism at 889 of the interleukin 1 alpha (IL1A) gene. ACE ESR1and IL1A polymorphisms were genotyped from 86 LOAD patients and 200control subjects. 46 of the LOAD patients and all of the 200 control sub jects were from a population based study investigating cardiovascular riskfactors and glucose metabolism in elderly people. The baseline study wasconducted in Kuopio in 1986 1988 and it included 1300 subjects aged 65 74 years who were randomly selected from the inhabitants of the town ofKuopio. The additional 40 LOAD patients genotyped were from the samegeographic area. No association was found between the AD and controlACE (p = 0.81) ESR1 PvuII (p = 0.85) ESR1 XbaI (p = 0.78) or IL1A (p =0.80) genotype. Our data suggest that there is no association between thestudied ACE ESR1 and IL1A gene polymorphisms and LOAD. ,2001
1342,Using non parametric analyses in 266 sib pair families from the NIMH sib ling dataset we previously reported results of a collaborative genome wide scan where polymorphic markers located at 1p36 and 6p21 were associ ated with Alzheimer s disease (AD) (Collins et al 2000 Go et al 1998 Collins et al 1998). Several inflammatory genes such as interleukin 1(IL1) a and IL1 b (Grimaldi et al 2000 Nicoll et al 2000) located at 2q14 21 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) located at 6p21 have been found tobe associated with AD. We recently reported a haplotype containing alle les of the 238 and 308 promoter polymorphisms of TNF and themicrosatellite TNFa located ~16.5 kb upstream of TNF was associatedwith AD in subset of the above families (Collins et al 2000). From a sub set of 320 families with an age of onset over seventy years (total NIMH sib ling dataset = 481) we found suggestion of linkage at two regions on chro mosome 1 including the same 1p terminal region. The GENEHUNTERprogram gave a peak NPL score of 1.66 (p value=0.023) and SIBPALanalysis resulted in a peak IBD score at 0.52 (p=0.033) for the p terminalregion. Because of the association of TNF to AD and the suggestion of the1p36 region linked to AD we looked at the tumor necrosis factor receptor2 (TNFR2) gene one of two main receptors for TNF located at 1p36.2. Weused family based association testing to look at the T >G polymorphism atposition 196 in exon 6 of TNFR2 that leads to a M >R substitution. How ever we did not find any significant association between TNFR2 and AD in150 families with at least two affected and one unaffected siblings (SIBAS SOC p=0.71 S TDT p=0.28 SDT p=0.63) (Collins 2000). The other TNFreceptor TNFR1 is located at 12 p13.2 a region where other genomewide scans have indicated as suggestively linked to AD (Kehoe et al 1999 Rogaeva et al 1998). We have genotyped an A >G silent change in codon12 of TNFR1 in the same set of late onset AD families and will presentthese results. ,2001
1343,We studied seven families of different ethnic origin with dominantly inherit ed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) or febrile convulsion. The TLE familieswere previously tested for known partial epilepsy loci on chromosomes20q 15q 10q 8q 19q 22q. All families were subjected to the genome wide scan using Weber set 9A which contains about 160 markers spacedat an average genetic distance of 25 cM throughout the entire autosomalgenome. We have identified a marker on chromosome 3 co segregatingwith the TLE phenotype in an American family of European descent. Thereare seven affected individuals in this family plus one of uncertain status all presenting infrequent simple or complex partial seizures some withvegetative aura or d j vu symptoms. Three had also generalized tonic clonic seizures. The maximum lod score of Z = 2.2 at theta = 0.0 wasobtained for the marker D3S2500 assuming 80% penetrance and a 1%phenocopy rate. All affected family members segregate the same haplo type. The exons of two candidate genes in the region KCNMB1 andKCNMB3 were sequenced but no mutation was found. ,2001
1344,Recently the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)started a multidisciplinary research programme on the causes effects andtreatment of (specific) reading impairment. This programme basically con sists of three parallel research projects. The first project is a prospectivestudy of the early precursors of dyslexia. The second project concerns anintervention study whereas the third component of the programme dealswith the search for genetic factors that are involved in dyslexia. Severalmethods can be employed to localize genes influencing complex disorderslike dyslexia. Major gene(s) with a strong effect on the phenotype will resultin dominant inheritance of the trait in extended pedigrees and can bedetected by classical parametric linkage analysis. Use of non parametricaffected sibpair analysis allows detection of genes with smaller effect. Theobjective of the genetic study is to apply both strategies to identify predis posing genes for dyslexia in the Dutch population. Four extended pedi grees consistent with autosomal dominant transmission with at least 9Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism 349dyslectics each have been recruited. In addition approximately 200 affected sibpairs from 165 nuclear families were sampled. The phenotypeof each subject was assessed by use of a series of psychometric testsincluding single word and non word reading non word repetition rapidnaming and spelling. Genome wide linkage analysis in the first extendedpedigree with 14 dyslexic subjects has been completed and results will bepresented. ,2001
1345,A insertion deletion polymorphism in promoter region of the SLC6A4 andEcoRV restriction polymorphism of the MAO A were studied for allelicassociation with alcohol withdrawal delirium in 96 Russian and 67 Tataralcoholic males as well as in their ethnically matched nonalcoholic malecontrols (60 Russians and 52 Tatars) within aboriginal groups of the Volga Ural region of Russia. The alcoholics were subtyped according to age ofonset of alcoholic dependence. For the SLC6A4 no significant differencesin allele and genotype frequencies between Russian and Tatar controlsand between alcoholics in whole and controls of the same ethnic groupwere observed. However a significantly higher frequency of the S/S geno type (0.43) and relatively lower frequency of the L/S genotype (0.29) werefound in Russian early onset alcoholics compared with Russian controls Russian later onset alcoholics and Tatar early onset alcoholics. The S/Sgenotype frequency in Russian later onset alcoholics (0.05) was signifi cantly lower compared with healthy Russian control and Tatar later onsetalcoholic. For the EcoRV polymorphism of the MAO A there were no sig nificant differences in allele frequencies between Russian and Tatar con trols and between alcoholics and controls of the same ethnic group. Theallele 456 frequency was significantly higher among Russian and Tatarearly onset alcoholics compared with nonalcoholic men. Thus our resultsindicate that the S/S genotype is associated with susceptibility to early onset alcoholism in Russian groups and allele 456 MAO A is correlatedwith early onset of the alcohol abuse among both investigated aboriginalgroups of the Volga Ural region of Russia. ,2001
1346,Periconceptional folic acid intake prevents about 70% of all Neural TubeDefects (NTDs). It has been demonstrated that alterations in folate andhomocysteine metabolism may play a role since NTD patients as well asmothers have moderately increased levels of plasma homocysteine. Homozygosity for the C677T mutation of the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene a key enzyme in the folates and homocysteinemetabolism is associated with an increased risk for NTD even in Italianpopulation which has a relatively low prevalence of NTD. However thisgenetic risk factor could not acount for all folic acid preventable NTD. Another mutation in the same gene the A1298C mutation results indecreased MTHFR activity which is more pronunced in the homozygousthan heterozygous state. In this study we studied the A1298C mutation inthe Italian population to evaluate its role as risk factor. We used 200 chil dren with sporadic myelomeningocoele 99 mothers and 64 fathers and190 unrelated normal volunteers as control group. The frequency of themutated C allele was 0.29 in controls versus 0.40 in patients 0.51 in themothers and 0.41 in the fathers. Thus we observed increased frequencyof the mutated allele in the NTD patients and their parents when comparedwith controls. The determined odd ratios showed an increased risk of 2.25(95% CI 1.14 4.47) for the prevalence of the C/C genotype in the affectedchildren versus controls. These data indicate that homozygosity for theA1298C mutation in the MTHFR gene is an important risk factor for ItalianNTD patients. ,2001
1347,46 XX maleness is an uncommon form of human sex reversal character ized by testicular development in subjects lacking a Y chromosome. 46 XXmales can be classified as Y positive or Y negative depending on the pres ence or absence of Y sequences. Approximately 90% of XX males carrythe SRY gene responsible for the testicular development. The remainingcases are SRY negative and testicular differentiation is probably due tomutations in autosomal or X linked sex determining genes. Most 46 XXmales occur sporadically but there are a few kindreds in which two or moreaffected individuals have been described all being SRY negative. To deter mine whether XX sex reversal was X linked we performed linkage analy sis using a total of 29 dinucleotide X chromosome markers in a previouslyreported family including two SRY negative XX male brothers. Our resultsshow that the affected males and a 46 XX normal sister inherited the samematernal X chromosome however at Xp21.1 3 the two brothers had incommon 6 marker alleles in homozygous state which differ from thoseobserved in their sister. This data show that in this family XX sex reversalco segregates with a 4.25 cM region at Xp a chromosomal segment thatincludes the Dosage Sensitive Sex reversal (DSS) locus. We propose thatDSS may be involved in the etiology of XX sex reversal either throughmolecular defects in DAX 1 or in a yet unidentified sex determining genelocated in this region. ,2001
1348,Oto palato digital syndrome type I (OPD I) (MIM31130) is a rare disordercharacterized by broad distal digits with short nails a peculiar face with asupraorbital ridge and conductive deafness. X linked transmission withintermediate expression in female and complete expression in males hasbeen demonstrated. The previous study provided evidence for the linkageof OPD I to the tightly linked markers DXS15 DXS52 and DXS305 atXq28 and refined the critical gene for OPD I to the approximately 10 Mbarea distal to nan,2001
1349,Non specific X mental retardation (NXMR) is a very common and geneti cally heterogeneous disorder and affect approximately 1/600 males. Overthe past two years the repertoire of loci involved in NXMR has expandedrapidly. Linkage studies carried out on several X linked mental retardation(XMR) families with informative meiosis and affected males distributed ontwo or three generations mapped at least 60 XMR loci. Each of theseaccounts for only 0.5 1% of XMR cases. Through positional cloning effortsix genes have been cloned. They are RSK2 (Xp22.2) IL1RAPL (Xp22) TM4SF2 (Xp11.4) OPHN1 (Xq12) PAK3 (Xq21.3) and GDI1 (Xq28). Herewe report linkage analysis strategy applied to a large Italian pedigreeaffected by NXMR to identify the causative disease gene. Using 14 STRscovering the entire X chromosome we have analysed on automaticsequencer the genotype of 23 individuals distributed on two generations ofwhich 7 affected males have mild or severe mental retardation. Paramet ric linkage data carried out by MLINK program indicate a maximum lodscore of 3.14 at theta = 0.00 for the polymorphic marker GATA72E05 locat ed inside the pericentromeric region of 23 cM between Xp21.1 and q22.1.This linked portion of Xper has a similar position of other 23 XMR familiesalready described in Xp11 q21. The XMR pericentromeric clustering sug gests allelism and the presence at least of 2 XMR genes in this region. Multipoint linkage studies are in progress to restrict the XMR candidateregion. ,2001
1350,Atherosclerosis is characterised by the formation of focal lesions whichprotrude into the arterial lumen obstructing blood flow and producing sta ble and unstable angina and acute MI. Monocyte CD14 receptor is acti vated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide to produce endothelial cell activation cytokine secretion and pathophysiological effects associated with the initi ation and development of atherosclerosis. It has been suggested that the T allele of a common polymorphism in the CD14 gene promoter is asso ciated with an increased risk of MI and that this effect may be due to anincreased density of CD14 receptors on monocytes in TT homozygousindividuals. We have examined the CD14 genotype and circulating mono cyte receptor density in 60 individuals with differing states of cardiac dis ease to determine whether such a correlation exists. ,2001
1351,Lipoprotein lipase (LPL triacylglyceroprotein acylhydrolase EC 3.1.1.34)plays a crucial role in plasma lipoprotein processing by catalyzing thehydrolysis of core triglycerides of chylomicrons and very low densitylipoproteins. So LPL gene is a logical candidate gene of cardiovascular dis eases (CVD). The aim of our study was to investigate whether commonHindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism at intron 8 of LPL gene isassociated with myocardial infarction (MI) in Russians and Tatars fromBashcortostan. Polymorphism of LPL gene was studied in unrelated maleswithout symptoms of CVD (53 Russians and 80 Tatars) and coronary heart disease patients MI survives under 55 years (98 Russians and 68 Tatars)by the polymerase chain reaction. The frequencies of the genotypes HindI II( / ) HindIII(+/ ) HindIII(+/+) in Russians (3.77% 49.06% and 47 17%)did not differ from that in Tatars (7.50% 51.24% and 41.25% accordingly) HindIII( ) allele frequency was 28.30% in Russians and 33.13% in Tatars. The HindIII(+/+) genotype was more common among MI survives thencontrol subjects in Tatars (odds ratio 1.56 p<0.05). It was also found thatfrequency of HindIII(+/+) genotype was higher ((odds ratio 6.85 p<0.05)and frequency of HindIII(+/ ) genotype was lower (odds ratio 0.17 p<0.05) in russians patients with repeated MI then in no CVD russians males. ,2001
1352,Autosomal Dominant Hypercholesterolemia (ADH) one of the most fre quent hereditary disorders is characterized by an isolated elevation of LDLparticles that leads to premature mortality from cardiovascular complica tions. It is generally assumed that mutations in LDLR and APOB genesaccount for ADH however we have shown that ADH is genetically moreheterogeneous. We identified 23 ADH families in which we excluded link age to LDLR and APOB thus demonstrating the implication of a new locuswe named FH3 . Genetic linkage was obtained in 6 pedigrees localizingFH3 in a 8 cM interval at 1p32 p34.1. This linkage result has been con firmed by S. Hunt et al. in a Utah pedigree. Taken together the haplotypedata define a 1 cM interval for nan,2001
1353,"Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) the most common genetic formof dyslipidemia in man affects 1 3% of the population and is found in up to20% of premature myocardial infarction survivors. FCHL is defined byhypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia and the presence ofcoronary heart disease (CHD) in a first degree relative < 60 years. Fur thermore FCHL is characterized by several traits that are associated withan increased risk of CHD including small dense LDL insulin resistance andincreased apolipoprotein B. Segregation analysis suggests a complex inheritance pattern with majordominant genes influencing the major FCHL traits. Although several gene mapping studies have surfaced candidate regions no causative geneshave been identified so far. Comparison of various linkage studies showsthat several candidate loci are common in different populations althoughoften with mixed findings in replication studies due to clinical genetic andethnic heterogeneity. We have collected and characterized 40 multigenerational families withFCHL including 687 individuals with high clinical and diagnostic homo geneity. Recently a genome wide linkage analysis with 405 microsatellitemarkers was performed with the support of the NIH in the 13 (n = 280)most informative families. Several candidate regions have been identified two of which stand out as extremely promising with a joint lod score of 3.8in a simultaneous search analysis. These two regions are located on chro mosomes 1 and 13 respectively. Two other loci on chromosomes 4 and 20showed promising lod scores between 1 and 2 individually. In order toenhance and pinpoint linkage evidence and eliminate false positive find ings fine mapping of candidate regions is being performed in the completeset of the 40 original families and three additional multigenerational FCHLfamilies (n>850). As the results of the first stage genome screen alreadyindicated locus heterogeneity for FCHL it is extremely important to deter mine the exact contribution of each of the loci involved. For this purpose quantitative trait analyses will be carried out for each of the traits thatunderlay FCHL. Noteworthy we have recently completed a 5 years clinicaland biochemical follow up in the 40 FCHL families giving important infor mation on phenotype variation.

After understanding therole of point mutations in the etiology of thrombosis the high prevalance ofFactor V Leiden (FVL) and Protrombin 20210 (Pt 20210) mutations beganto gain more importance. Previously the incidence of Turkish heterozygouscarrier status for FVL and Pt 20210 were described as7% and 2.3%respectively. This study was designed for the determination of FVL and Pt20210 carrier status in hemodialysis patients with history of arteriovenousfistula (AVF) thrombotic complications. 46 adult hemodialysis patients(mean age 45.66+12.31years mean HD duration 87.37+ 54.07months)who had AVF thrombosis at least three episodes were subjected .Singlenucleotid polymorphism was searched in FVL (Arg506Gln) and Protrom bin(G A) genes by real time PCR and the fluorometric DNA melting pointanalysis. At the end of these molecular analysis mutation of FVL was foundin 7 ( 15.2%)patients and Pt 20210 in 4 ((8.7%) patients. These results mayindicate that the incidence of the both mutations were two fold increased inhemodialysis patients when compared with normal population. As a con clusion in patients with frequent AVF thrombosis in addition to medicaland surgical reasons genetic factors should be investigated. Furtherthrombogenic complications can be prevented by early identification of thishigh risk group. ",2001
1354,Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a potent fibrinolysisinhibitor. TAFI gene variations were not reported heretofore. We analyzeda 2083 bp region at 5 of the TAFI gene in 127 healthy subjects and iden tified 7 novel polymorphisms 152 A/G 438 A/G 530 C/T 1053 T/C 1102 T/G 1690 G/A and 1925 T/C. The 152 A/G 530 C/T and 1925T/C transitions were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium as well as 438 A/G 1102 T/G 1053 T/C and 1690 G/A. Plasma TAFI levels (%) insubjects with the 438GG/ 1102GG/ 1053CC/ 1690AA genotype (n=70)were 94Ã¢\x80\x9316.5 heterozygotes 438GA/ 1053TC/ 1102TG/ 1690AG (n=51)had TAFI levels of 84.6Ã¢\x80\x9315.5 and in 438AA/ 1053TT/ 1102TT/ 1690GGhomozygous (n=6) levels were 72.2 Ã¢\x80\x93 8.8 (P=0.0003). TAFI concentrationsin 152AA/ 530CC/ 1925TT homozygous (n=122) were 89.4Ã¢\x80\x9317.1 some what higher but not significantly different from levels observed 152AG/ 530CT/ 1925TC heterozygous (84Ã¢\x80\x939.9 n=5). We also examined TAFIpolymorphisms as risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by deter mining their prevalence in 388 consecutive patients with DVT and in 388matched controls. The 438GA/ 1053TC/ 1102TG/ 1690AG and 438AA/ 1053TT/ 1102TT/ 1690GG polymorphisms were detected in 166 patientsand in 187 controls yielding an odds ratio (OR) for DVT of 0.8 (95%CI 0.6 1). Although the OR for DVT linked to 152AG/ 530CT/ 1925TC had beenof 1 (95%CI 0.5 2.2) in the whole group in subjects aged <35ys the ORwas 0.1 (95%CI 0.01 0.9) indicating a significant protective effect for DVT. In conclusion we identified variations in the TAFI gene and demonstratedthat they influence plasma TAFI levels. The data also suggest that TAFIpolymorphisms may influence the risk for DVT. ,2001
1355,Essential tremor (ET) is a chronic neurological condition which may beregarded as the most common movement disorder in human. The mainfeature of ET is postural tremor of the arms but the head legs trunk voice jaw and facial muscles may be involved as well. ET can be eithersporadic or familial (familial essential tremor FET or ETM). In addition theprevalence of Parkinson s disease and dystonia may be increased in fam ilies with ET. Autosomal dominant inheritance can be demonstrated in mostfamilies and two ET loci have been mapped on chromosomes 3q13(ETM1 MIM 190300) and 2p25 p22 (ETM2 MIM 602134) respectively. Here we report on a large Moroccan family with isolated autosomal domi nant ET. Interestingly patients presented with a very early onset. They aremainly affected with fine rapid ET of both hands and arms. We testedmicrosatellites DNA markers at the ETM1 and ETM2 loci and eventuallyexcluded linkage to both regions suggesting further genetic heterogeneityof FET. Furthermore the Parkinson s loci mapping to chromosomes 4 and6 were also excluded. Ongoing gene mapping studies will hopefully shedligh on the genetic variability of ET. ,2001
1356,Autosomal Dominant Medullary Cystic Kidney Disease (ADMCKD) is anadult onset heterogeneous genetic nephropathy characterized by saltwasting and end stage renal failure. The gene responsible for ADMCKD1was mapped on chromosome 1q21 and it is flanked proximally by markerD1S498 and distally by D1S2125 encompassing a region of ~8cM. With in this region there is a large number of transcribed genes including NPR1that encodes the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor 1. This receptor plays acrucial role in regulation of blood pressure by facilitating salt excretion. Based on its presumed function we hypothesized this gene as a reason able candidate for the MCKD1 locus. DNA mutation screening was per formed on the entire NPR1 gene coding sequence including theexon/intron splice junctions. The samples investigated belonged topatients of five large ADMCKD1 Cypriot families. The screening revealedtwo novel polymorphisms one intragenic at aminoacid position 939 whichwas occupied by either arginine or glutamine and a second one located inthe 3 UTR 29 nucleotides downstream the NPR1 stop codon. The latter was a single nucleotide C insertion/deletion in a stretch a three or four Cs. No relationship was present between any allele of the two polymorphismsand the disease as both alleles were observed in both affected andhealthy subjects. In addition no association was observed between the352 Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism disease and another rare 8 bp deletion polymorphism at the 5 UTR of NPR1 and the disease. Based on these findings it is unlikely that NPR1 isthe same as the MCKD1 gene although it is presently unknown whether itplays a disease modifying role. ,2001
1357,We describe a family with AD variable ectrodactyly encompassing theclassical lobster claw deformity through to partial absence of the thumband radial ray distal agenesis of the index finger and epiphysial coning. One individual has an unusual supernumerary ossicle with an articular sur face opposed to the distal phalanx of the thumb. Two individuals had skele tal manifestations consistent with EEC one with unilateral dysplasia of thenails of fingers 2 4 and another with cleft palate. Due to the presence ofthese features a linkage study for the EEC Split Hand Split Foot (SHFM)4 locus (p63)was undertaken. Two point Lod scores were calculated forthree microsatellite markers that lie within 0.55cM of p63 and flank thegene. Linkage was excluded by Lod scores of < 2 within 8cM of D3S3549 3cM of D3S3530 and 1cM of D3S1294 (Zmax is 4.9). Of the three otherknown SHFM loci SHFM2 is X linked SHFM1 (7q21.3 q22.1) is usuallysporadic comprising additional features of deafness cleft palate andmicrocephaly which were not present in this family. SHFM3 (10q24) con tains a candidate F box/WD40 gene Dactylin which is currently beingexamined by other researchers. The HOXD cluster on the long arm ofchromosome 2 has also been associated with ectrodactyly but our familydoes not have the imperforate anus or penoscrotal hypoplasia associatedwith deletion of the whole cluster. Currently further linkage analyses areunderway to determine whether linkage to 10q24 exists for our SHFM fam ily or whether this represents a novel locus. ,2001
1358,Background Family studies in different ethnic populations have shown thatchromosome 1q23 q42 interval is linked with SLE. Several potential can didates are mapped to this region including the gamma chain (FcRg) FcgRs IL 10 CRP SAP PARP and TGFb2. Objectives To investigatepositional candidate genes polymorphisms and to study the possible asso ciation between identified polymorphisms and SLE in patients from threedifferent populations. Methods We have investigated the FcRg FcgRIIband TGFb2 genes for polymorphisms using PCR SSCP and sequencing. Identified polymorphisms were typed using PCR RFLP method. Cases andcontrols were available from three ethnic groups Turkish (95) Spanish(120 ) and UK (100 ). All the patients fulfilled the 1982 ACR revised crite ria for SLE. Results Five SNPs have been identified in the FcRg gene 2SNPs in the promoter one in intron four and 2 in the 3 UTR. Four out ofthe 5 SNPs were relatively common and therefore investigated in the 3populations. Allele and genotype frequencies of all four SNPs investigatedwere not statistically different in cases and controls. In addition polymor phisms has identified in the 5 UTR of TGFb 2 and in the 5 UTR and intron3 of FcgRIIb. Discussion The FcRg FcgRIIb and TGFb2 genes are poly morphic. The identified FcRg polymorphisms do not contribute to SLE sus ceptibility. However these polymorphisms may be useful in studying other diseases. The polymorphisms identified in the FcgRIIb and TGFb2 geneswill be investigated in the three different ethnic case control groups. ,2001
1359,Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common form of childhood seizures. FShave both environmental and genetic factors involved in their pathogene sis. These convulsions probably have a variety of causes but a geneticcomponent has long been recognised. The genetics of familial FSs issomewhat ambiguous. Polygenic autosomal dominant and autosomalrecessive models have received support. Recently four putative FSs loci FEB1 (chromosome 8q13 q21) FEB2 (chromosome 19p) FEB3 (chromo some 2q23 24) and FEB4 (chromosome 5q14 15) have been mapped. Inthis study we conducted a linkage analysis to the four known FSs loci ineight small families originating in Southern Italy that appeared to segregateFS as an autosomal dominant trait. Members of these families were geno typed using microsatellite markers linked to the previously identified febrileconvulsion loci FEB1 FEB2 FEB3 and nan,2001
1360,Idiopatic dystonias are neurological disorders characterized by involuntarytwisting movements of affected parts of the body. Most dystonia cases aresporadic. However familial dystonias mostly with autosomal dominanttransmission pattern reduced penetrance and variable expression notuncommonly come to the clinician attention. Seven genes for dystoniashave been mapped so far and two of them have been identified (the Torsi nA and the GTP cyclohydrolase gene) carrying mutations in particular fam ilies. Two loci DYT6 and DYT7 in chromosome 8p and 18p respectively have been linked to single families with primary purely focal dystonias. Thelinkage has never been confirmed by other groups. Here we present athree generation family (15 members) from South of Italy with 8 patientsaffected by focal dystonia with age of onset between 20 and 50 years. Wehave analysed for linkage both the DYT6 and DYT7 regions by genotipingall the family members. Samples were loaded on a ABI PRISM 310 andanalysed with the Genotyper 2.0 software. Furthermore the DYT1 gene on9q31 was screened for the GAGdel mutation. In this family the studyexcluded linkage of the dystonia gene both for the DYT6 and DYT7 loci and absence of the recurrent DYT1 mutation. The findings comfirm thehigh genetic heterogeneity of famlial idiopatic dystonias in particular thefocal and multifocal forms. (This work was supported by MURST ) ,2001
1361,Twin studies have suggested a strong genetic component to osteoarthritis(OA) especially that of the hand. We have collected extensive phenotypicand genetic data on 470 subjects from 68 families containing at least twoliving affected individuals in Tasmania Australia. Phenotypic assessmentof hand OA utilised the Altman atlas for joint narrowing and osteophytes. This score was quantitative (range 0Ã¢\x80\x9458 out of a possible 60) and of highreproducibility (intra class correlation 0.94Ã¢\x80\x940.98). Subjects have beengenotyped at 19 markers on chromosome 2q. We attempted to reproducethe findings of Lepp vuori et al. (Am. J. Hum. Genet. 65 1060) by usingan identical design and a non parametric linkage (NPL) analysis on 2q of69 individuals in 22 families with severe distal interphalangeal joint OA. Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism 353The maximum NPL score was 1.05 (at the same marker (IL1R1) identified by Lepp vuori et al.). These results do not provide confirmation of linkage at this site in our population. Subsequent fine mapping QTL analysis orgenome wide screens may be required for demonstration of linkage in thispopulation. ,2001
1362,The aim of our study was to analyse CFTR gene polymorphisms useful inindirect DNA diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis in Latvia. 31 patient with CF 30healthy family members and 146 healthy Latvians were subjected to DNAtesting. DNA analysis was performed by PCR restriction analysis andagarose or polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis. All DNA samples have beenanalysed for six CFTR gene polymorphisms. 3 extragenic diallelic poly morphic sites KM 19/PstI XV 2C/TaqI nan,2001
1363,Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal recessive genet ic disorders in the Caucasian population and is caused by mutations in thecystic fiobrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. The 5T allele inintron 8 causes abnormal splicing of the CFTR gene by skipping of exon 9leading to non functional protein. In combination with an other CF mutationthe 5T allele might be associated with congenital bilateral absence of thevas deferens (CBAVD) or chronic pancreatitis. However the 5T variant hasincomplete penetrance and variable expressivity suggesting that someother regulatory factors may modulate the splicing of exon 9. Furthermore the 5T allele alone has not been reported to cause lung disease. Wedescribe a three years old male patient with CF like lung disease. Sweatchloride conductance has been rising over the last three months (37 7 53 7 66 6 67 0 mmol/l) with increasing frequency of respiratory infec tions but still no pneumonia. The digestive function appears normal. Com plete sequencing of the CFTR gene revealed the TG11/ 5T allele in com bination with the M470V polymorphism. No other mutation was present. These data suggest that the 5T polythymidine tract on specific haplotypebackgrounds (number of TG repeats presence of M470V) may cause mildCF like lung disease with moderate values of sweat chloride conductance. ,2001
1364,Clinical otosclerosis has a prevalence of 0.2 to 1% among white adults making it the single most common cause of hearing impairment in this pop ulation. It is a disease of the otic capsule that is characterized by resorp tion and redeporsition of bony tissue. The majority of epidermiologicalstudies indicate that the inheritance of otosclerosis is autosomal dominantwith reduced penetrance. To date only one otosclerosis locus OTSC1 has been mapped on chromosome 15q. We studied a large multi genera tional family in which otosclerosis has been inherited in an autosomal dom inant pattern. Six of the affected persons have surgically confirmed oto sclerosis. Exclusion study on this family by typing genetic markers thatlinked to OTSC1 indicates that a novel otosclerosis gene segregates in thisfamily. We are now in the process of locating the disease causing genethrough whole genome scan and genetic linkage analysis. Once the gene is mapped a correlation between the genotypes and phenotypes will beclosely examined. ,2001
1365,The androgen receptor protein is essential for androgen action by bindingeither testosterone (T) or its 5a reduced metabolite 5a dihydrotestos terone. Thus the androgen receptor gene (AR) plays an essential role inthe development of male sexual characteristics. The AR gene has a rela tively long 5 untranslated region (5 UTR). Since this region may play a rolein translation control protein expression could be modulated by polymor phisms in the normal male population. In addition a previous report of twogermline point mutations in the 5 UTR of the AR gene in men with prostatecancer1 suggest that these alterations may contribute to this disease. Wetherefore evaluate the variability of this region in healthy individuals and inprostate cancer patients from a Brazilian population. The screening forpolymorphisms in the 5 UTR was performed by CSGE. Genomic DNAsfrom 100 male blood donors and from 100 patients with prostate cancerwere amplified by PCR with 4 pairs of primers designed to cover a 1 400bp region. Since the AR gene is X linked each product was mixed with apreviously sequenced normal fragment in order to generate heterodu plexes in the presence of point mutations. Only one mutation was detect ed by this technique in one individual from the blood donors sample con sisting of one base pair deletion ( T at position 1110) identified bysequencing. The deletion observed is situated far from the critical region therefore its possible effects might be minimised. These results point outthe highly conserved character of this region. 1Crocitto et al. J Urol158 1599 1601 1997. supported by FAPESP. ,2001
1366,Nitric oxide inhibits platelet aggregation proliferation of vascular smoothmuscle cells and leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. An impaired syn thesis of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium has been implicated inthe pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. Thus genetic polymorphismof endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) may be involvedin the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The possible asso ciations between variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism(VNTR 27 bp repeat) at intron 4 of ecNOS gene essential hypertension(EH) myocardial infarction (MI) were investigated in Russians fromBashkortostan. Polymorphism of ecNOS gene was studied in unrelatednormotensive males without symptoms of CAD (102 subjects) CADpatients MI survives under 55 years (107 subjects) EH patients (107 sub jects). The VNTR region of ecNOS gene was amplified by the polymerasechain reaction two alleles containing four (allele A) and five repeats (alleleB) were identified. Distinctions between controls and hypertensivepatients with left ventricular hypertrophy were found in patients the geno types eNOS4A/A eNOS4A/B and eNOS4B/B were discovered in 4.17% 52 08% 43 75% of case alleles A and B in 30.21% and 69.79% of case respectively. In controls genotypes and alleles distributions were as fol lows eNOS4A/A Ã¢\x80\x94 1.96% eNOS4A/B Ã¢\x80\x94 29.41% eNOS4B/B Ã¢\x80\x94 68.62% and A Ã¢\x80\x94 16.17% B Ã¢\x80\x94 83.33%. But genotypes and alleles frequencies did not dif fer significantly between MI patients and controls. Thus eNOS minisatellitpolymorphism might be a genetic risk factor for the development of leftventricular hypertrophy among russian hypertensive patients. ,2001
1367,African Americans demonstrate familial clustering of hypertensive ESRD(H ESRD). Animal models of H ESRD also suggest that genetic factorsmake strong contributions to renal failure. In the Fawn Hooded rat model the majority of the risk for glomerulosclerosis appears to be on rat chro 354 Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphismmosome 1 (the Rf1 and Rf2 genes). These renal failure genes appear to promote the development of nephrosclerosis. The corresponding syntenicregions of the human genome for Rf1 and Rf2 have been isolated to 10q24 26 and 9q21 respectively. DNA was collected from 452 African American sib pairs concordant forESRD 249 of these ESRD sib pairs are concordant for non diabetic eti ologies of ESRD (H ESRD and chronic glomerulonephritis) and 203 ESRDsib pairs are concordant for diabetic ESRD. We evaluated the Rf1 region on chromosome 10 as a candidate gene for ESRD in black sibling pairsconcordant for ESRD. We tested for genetic linkage between 21 polymor phic markers spanning chromosome 10 and ESRD using the GeneHunter(version 2) software. When these 21 markers were genotyped in the 249 non diabetic ESRD sibpairs suggestive evidence for linkage was observed between adjacentmarkers D10S249 and D10S1435 on chromosome 10p (lod score ~ 1.7).Additionally genes near the Rf1 region demonstrated weak evidence for linkage to all cause ESRD (lod score ~ 1.2). These results suggest thatgenes underlying human H ESRD susceptibility may be found on chromo some 10p in man and also in the region homologous to the rodent Rf1 gene. ,2001
1368,The cytochromes P450 play an important role in the metabolic activation ofmany precarcinogens. Different polymorphic variants are associated withcancer susceptibility. Development of urinary tract tumors (UTT) is a clini cal problem for 38 40 % of the patients with BEN. The aim of the study isto compare CYP2D6 polymorphism in BEN patients and healthy persons.125 samples are genotyped (55 from BEN patients and 70 samples fromhealthy persons) for three CYP2D6 mutant alleles responsible for the PMphenotype. CYP2D6*A CYP2D6*B and CYP2D6*D alleles were identifiedusing allele specific PCR (Heim and Meyer 1991). The frequency ofhomozygotes BEN patients for mutant alleles is 5.45% versus 10% inhealthy group. Significant differences between the frequencies of het erozygotes in BEN group (12.73%) and healthy persons (31.43%)(p<0.01)were revealed. The frequency of homozygotes of wild type allele was sig nificantly higher in BEN patients (81.82%) compared to the controls(58.57%)(p<0.01). We suggest that wild type allele might be associatedwith genetic predisposition to development of urinary tract tumors in BENpatients. ,2001
1369,A polymorphic (TAAA)n tandem repeat is located in an alu repeat in thenon coding sequence of the ACPP (prostatic acid phospatase) gene in3q21 3qter. DNAs blood samples from 89 persons (178 alleles) were studied for poly morphism in ACPP locus 34 from Bulgarian healthy persons (68 alleles)and 55 from patients (110 alleles) with Balkan endemic nephropathy(BEN). Four different alleles C2 C3 C4 and C6 in the studied healthy Bulgarianindividuals were identified. Their respective frequencies were as follows C2 0.088 C3 0.441 C4 0.309 and C6 0.162. Our analysis showedthat the frequency of the detected allelic variants in Bulgarian population issimilar to those reported in the literature (Doak et al. 1991). The most fre quent alleles in Bulgarian population were C3 and nan,2001
1370,The observation of a multiple sclerosis (MS) like illness in patients whocarry the most common Leber s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) mito chondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation may indicate a contributory role for mito chondrial genes in genetic susceptibility to MS. During a screening studyof Calabrian patients with MS like illness for the pathogenic LHON muta tions at positions 11778 3460 and 14484 of human mithocondrial DNA weobserved a new genetic polymorphism caused by a variation of the basepair (bp) at position 14562 which is located in the gene for mitochondrialND6. The variant is a C? T transition which creates one new restriction site Mbo I leading to Valine substitution for Isoleucine. The restriction frag ments were detected by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel and visualisedby ethidium bromide staining. This polymorphism was observed in apatient 36 year old male clinically diagnosed MS. The molecular analy sis of other asymptomatic members of proband s family confirmed thesame nucleotide variation. The primary LHON mutations at nucleotides11778 3460 and 14484 were not present in this patient. We performed amutational analysis in fifty normal subjects from the same geographicbackground but this polymorphism was not present. Thus this novelnucleotide transition is a neutral polymorphism. ,2001
1371,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) present polymorphic sequences which arewidely distributed across human genome. They are highly informativegenetic markers and are extensively used in such fields as populationgenetics genetic councelling forensic medicine and oncology. However allele frequencies may differ in the populations of different origin. Sodescribing of allele frequencies distribution of such markers in differentpopulations is of great interest. We have obtained population genetic char acteristics of tetra nucleotide short tandem repeat D9S768 in the popula tion of South West Siberia (N=128 non related mainly of Slavic origin) The study was performed by analysis of separation of PCR products(amplimer UT5494 in GDB) in 7% acrylamide gel. 7 common alleles wereidentified in this locus.

1372,Dupuytren s disease (DD) is a benign fibroproliferative tumour of unknowncause. It is a familial condition and commonly affects Northern EuropeanCaucasian men. Genetic studies have yet to identify the genes involved inDD formation. Transforming growth factor beta one (TGF b1) is a multi functional cytokine which plays a central role in wound healing and fibro sis. TGF b1 has been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and extra cellular matrix deposition. Previous immunohistochemical studies haveimplicated TGF b1 in DD. In the light of above evidence it is feasible thatTGF b1 is a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of DD. The aim of thisstudy was to investigate the association of four common single nucleotidepolymorphisms in TGF b1 with the risk of DD formation. A polymerasechain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP)method was used for genotyping TGF b1 polymorphisms. DNA samplesfrom 135 DD patients and 199 controls were examined. There was no sta tistically significant difference in TGF b1 genotype or allele frequency dis tributions between cases and controls for the codons 10 25 and 509 800 polymorphisms. These results suggest that common TGF b1 poly morphisms are not associated with a risk of DD formation. However thesedata should be interpreted with caution as the lack of association was onlyshown in one cohort of cases (n=135) with only known common polymor phisms of TGF b1. We are presently increasing our sample size and look ing for novel polymorphisms in the TGF b1 for further investigations. ,2001

The commonest forms areRheumatoid Arthiritis ( age of onset 3rd 5th decade) Juvenile ChronicArthiritis ( age of onset < 16 years)and Osteoarthrosis (age of onset > 40years).Our study aims at identifying polymorphic variations of superoxidedismutase (SOD) in the local population and with reference to arthiritis. Blood samples from 136 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthiritis juve nile arthritis and osteoarthritis (54 16 and 66 respectively) referred fromKing Koti Hospital Hyderabad were analysed alongwith 133 age and sexmatched controls for phenotyping SOD following PAGE of red cell mem brane. The frequency of allelic distribution Hardy Weinbergequilibrium(HWE) and test for association were studied in the individualgroups and as a whole and compared with the controls. The haplotype fre quencies of alleles 2 and 1 of SOD were 0.656 and 0.344 ( controls) 0.740and 0.259 (rheumatoid arthritis) 0.787 and 0.212 ( osteoarthrosis) and0.781 and 0.219 ( juvenile chronic arthiritis) respectively with a significantdeviation from the HWE in the arthritic group compared to the control group. Individuals of 2 2 phenotype were found to be at a higher risk forarthritis compared to the control group. They were also at a higher riskcompared to the 1 1 and1 2 phenotypes within the arthritic group. Our find ings strongly suggest that SOD phenotyping can be used as a geneticmarker for risk prediction in rheumatoid arthritis and to help formulatecounseling strategies. ,2001
1374,Duodenal Ulcer (DU) a common structural disorder of the gastrointestinalmucosa was found to result due to an imbalance between the aggressiveand defensive mechanism. Since studies so far have clearly pinpointed therole of genetic factors in the etiology of DU the present study aims at iden tifying the polymorphic variation of AAT in the 173 healthy individuals and210 endoscopically confirmed cases of DU. Sourcing samples from theseindividuals was phenotyped for AAT following PAGE and immunoblot tech niques. Increased preponderence of Z & S alleles in the disease groupcompared to control group was observed. A significant deviation from theHardy Weinberg equilibrium was observed with respect to the gene andgenotypic frequencies in comparison to controls. The relative risk esti mates also revealed that homozygous ZZ and SS genotypes were at anincreased risk for ulceration suggesting that deficiency of serum AAT inDU cases as reported earlier could be accounted by the S & Z alleles inthe disease group because of point mutations ,2001
1375,A large five generation family with nonsyndromic X linked mental retarda tion (XLMR) has been mapped to the pericentric region at Xp11 q21.Twenty five of sixty five family members were studied including the six liv ing affected males. None of the obligate carriers was retarded. Clinicalfindings included a small head circumference in affected males and verylarge testes in two affected adults. Affected males had mild to moderatemental retardation and several had accomplished independent living. Link age analysis detected linkage to Xq11 q21 with a maximum Z=1.69 atDXS1216 with a q=0.00. Multipoint linkage analysis by GENEHUNTERyielded a maximal Lod score of 3.84 in a 30 cM region between DXS1199(Xp11) and DXS986 (Xq21).. Oligophrenin I is a known XLMR gene withinthis region and mutational analysis is in progress. Most interestingly thehaplotype analysis indicated that the mutation must have been transmittedthrough the founding male in generation I. This family therefore repre sents the first instance of nonsyndromic XLMR in which there was inheri tance through a normal male. The Fragile X Syndrome is the only otherknown XLMR disorder with inheritance through a normal male. ,2001
1376,Epidemiological studies have shown an association of decreased serumbilirubin levels with coronary heart disease. Two segregation analyses inlarge pedigrees have suggested a major gene responsible for high biliru bin levels occurring in about 12% of the population. Based on a recessivemodel from segregation analysis of 1967 individuals in 50 Utah pedigrees we performed a genome scan using 589 markers to detect loci significant ly linked to bilirubin levels. Two regions suggestive for linkage were foundby multipoint linkage analysis. The first region is on chromosome 2q with amaximum multipoint LOD score of 3.2 for marker D2S1363. This regioncontains a previously described gene uridine diphosphate glycosyltrans ferase 1 which has been associated with high bilirubin levels. A secondregion was found on chromosome 18 with marker D18S818 having a max imum multipoint LOD score of 2.7. These results provide evidence that loci356 Posters: Linkage Mapping and Polymorphisminfluencing bilirubin variation exist on chromosomes 2q and 18p. ,2001
1377,Family based and case control association studies and linkage disequilib rium analysis were performed on 50 Dutch vitiligo families (150 individuals)and 204 healthy controls. They were genotyped for HLA class II genes byPCR and sequence specific oligonucleotides (SSO s). Both linkage dise quilibrium and case control analysis showed the linkage and association ofDRB4*0101 allele with vitiligo (pc = 0.0016 relative risk =2.21). The fami ly based association study also provided evidence for linkage and associ ation of DQB1*0303 allele with vitiligo disorder (l2 = 7.36 p=0.006). Wemeasured the clinical relevance of the test by calculating prevalence cor rected positive predictive values (PcPPV) of test. The PcPPV of diseasefor DRB4*0101 allele was 0.017 and for DRB4*0101/0101 genotype was0.0358. Which means that when a random person has DRB4*0101/0101genotype who has a 3.58% risk to develop vitiligo. Taking all together ourresults show that both DRB4*0101 and DQB1*0303 alleles are provide sig nificant susceptibility for vitiligo disorder and able to explain findings ofother studies on the association of the HLA class II with vitiligo. ,2001
1378,Congenital muscular dystrophies(CMD)are a heterogenous group of mus cular disorder characterised by an autosomal recessive mode of inheri tance. The CMD have been classified according to the involvment of thebrain and the eyes. It is apparent that defects in different genes are respon sable for each type. A deficiency of the alpha 2 chain of laminine2(Merosin)occurs in about 40 50% of cases with the classical form ofCMD. It is a primary phenomenon caused by defects in the gene formerosin(LAMA2)on chromosome 6q22.Recently a group of new separateentities of CMD have been reported. It encompasses unclassified CMDforms with merosin deficiency with or without structural brain abnormali ties mental retardation absence of severe eye defects and unlinked tochromosomes 6 9 and 1.We have studied 3 cases affected with CMD andbelonging to threeTunisian families. These patients had benefied fromcomplete clinical investigation. Immunohistochemical and western blotanalysis on muscles biopsies was performed using monoclonal antibodiesagainst human merosin (80 and 300 fragments).Linkage analysis wasundertaken using microsatellite markers spanning LAMA2locus on6q22 FCMD locus on 9q31 MEB locus on 1p32 and CMD1B locus on1q42.Clinical investigation of the three patients showed severe motordelay and moderate mental retardation in all cases and calf hypertrophy inone case and pontocerebellar hypoplasia associated to cerebellar cystsand white matter abnormalities in the other cases. Immunohistochemicaland western blot analysis revealed a partial merosin deficiency in allcases. DNA analysis exclude any linkage to chromosome6 9 and1.In con lusion these patients showed a CMD form with secondary merosin defi ciency unlinked to chromosomes 6 9 and 1. ,2001
1379,A rapid multiplexing high throughput read out technology for singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was developed employing bothflow cytometric analysis of fluorescent microspheres and enzyme basedallele detection. An array of fluorescent microspheres (each population ofmicrospheres is identified by its unique profile of red and orange fluores cence) was coupled to unique DNA oligonucleotide sequences termed complementary ZipCodes (cZipCodes). Allele detection was based oneither single base chain extension assay (SBCE) where a synthetic cap ture oligonucleotide probe was designed to contain both a ZipCode sequence at the 5 end and an SNP specific sequence at the 3 end. A DNApolymerase adds a fluorescently labeled nucleotide to the capture oligonu cleotide which was then hybridized to its cZipCode on the microsphere. Flow cytometric analysis of the microspheres simultaneously identifiedboth the microsphere type and the fluorescent signal associated with theSNP genotype. This system is automated by the integration of manypieces of unique equipment for HTP SNP analysis. ,2001
1380,Extensive efforts have been made in recent years to search for predispos ing genes of complex diseases using genome wide scans but only veryfew genes were identified yet. The purpose of this study was to analyse thedata of 99 genome wide scans done between 1993 and 2000 found bymedline. In addition to statistical models and threshold definitions trendsin the study design reflect the experiences of real studies and will be help ful for further research. All scans used microsatellite markers. The numberof investigations increased rapidly in the observation time (from 6 in1993/1994 to 45 in 1999/2000). With regard to year of publication quanti tative and qualitative traits (1 6) showed a proportionally equal increase asdid the relation of isolated and non isolated populations (1 5). The investi gation of sibpairs increased steadily in the last years while the affected rel atives and extended pedigrees design decreased. The most remarkableobservation is a shift in the number of probands per study from average323 in 1993 1996 (n=18) to 456 in 1999/2000 (n=38). No conclusions canbe derived from these results for example which study design proves tobe superior because neither the investigation of isolated populations northe calculation with quantitative traits has shown advantages in gene local isation. The experiences of the last 8 years however lead to the insight that an investigation of far more families per study is necessary to identifypredisposing genes. ,2001
1381,"Much attention has recently been focused on the relative values of isolat ed and outbred populations in identifying genes affecting complex traits. Inparticular the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in outbred and isolatedpopulations was recently studied. In those studies it has been suggestedthat on average there is little difference between isolated (Finns and Sar dinians) and outbred populations (UK US and CEPH samples). We have explored this question by looking at Ashkenazi Jews a knownisolated population and also by re examining the results presented in Tail lon Miller et al. (2000). As anticipated and previously reported for SNPs atdistances up to 200kb there is no significant difference between the levelsof LD for isolated and outbred populations. However when the distancebetween SNPs was greater than 200kb the level of LD (represented by r 2) was higher in the Finnish Sardinian and Ashkenazi samples by 4.7 6.1and 7.0 fold respectively. It should be noted that r 2is proportional to sam ple size required to identify a specific gene. Thus in some instances a fiveto sevenfold increase in sample size might be required if outbred samplesare used as compared to an isolated population. Independent of the extent of LD isolated populations have other importantadvantages mainly in reducing genetic heterogeneity which can signifi cantly increase genotypic relative risk and hence increase statisticalpower. Consequently in some instances the use of isolated populationswill allow the discovery of genes that could not be discovered otherwise.

We identified a small village named Carlantino characterized by 1417 inhabitants and located in South ern Italy. The village has been settled 5 centuries ago by few founders andduring last century the endogamy has been calculated to be 99.5%. Threedifferent surnames accounts for the majority of the living people. In additionbirth registers are available from 17th century and in a more detailed wayfrom 19th century.

1382,Presently association studies used to find low penetrance cancer sus ceptibility alleles can only be performed in candidate genes. Ultimately theaim is to conduct genome wide scans to find numerous loci in one experi ment using markers (SNPs) spaced throughout the genome. The successof such scans will be critically dependent on their design. We have exam ined the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in relation to physical dis tance using 38 SNPs in 3 autosomal genomic regions and 4 different Euro pean populations. We find a similar inverse relationship between LD anddistance in each region and in each population. Although statistically sig nificantly LD exists between marker pairs >200Kb apart only 50% of mark er pairs at <5Kb display sufficient LD to be useful for association studies. These results indicate that a genome wide scan would require SNPsspaced at least every 5Kb or 600 000 markers per scan. Previous results suggesting more extensive LD may be the result of biases due to smallsample sizes. However the estimated 40 000 100 000 genes in the humangenome will be sequenced by 2003. It might be more feasible to conducta scan solely using SNPs in genes particularly since there is some evi dence that LD may be more extensive within genes than between them. We are examining the extent of LD between SNPs within different genesand will compare this with the LD observed in random genomic regions. ,2001
1383,A major obstacle to the systematic analysis of SNP variation and its asso ciation to phenotype (even across relatively small genomic regions) is thelack of an analytic framework for interpretation of population haplotype pat terns (linkage disequilibrium). Through the development of new mathe matical approaches we show here a comprehensive exploration of thepatterns of variation across ~350 kb in the 5q31 region as reported in anaccompanying abstract (Rioux et. al.). We observe surprisingly limitedhaplotype diversity across significant distances discretely punctuated bysites of multiple historical recombinations. This leads us to propose ahypothesis for the nature of haplotype variation across short genomicregions (10s 100s of kb) and a model for interpreting and using such vari ation that may provide a powerful framework for future genetic studies. ,2001
1384,The Chiari 1 malformation (CM1) is defined as herniation of the cerebellartonsils through the foramen magnum but recently we and others have pro posed a volumetrically too small posterior fossa as causative. CM1 is theleading cause of syringomyelia (S). We propose a genetic hypothesis to atleast a subset of CM1/S cases based on familial clustering in a rare dis ease co segregation with known genetic syndromes and concordance inlike sex twins. We have identified 67 multiplex pedigrees. Some familiesdemonstrate male to male transmission and transmission across morethan two generations. Additional support for a genetic hypothesis forCM1/S comes from co segregation of CM1 with at least 18 known geneticsyndromes including among others achondroplasia Klippel Feilsequence Hadju Cheney syndrome Albright hereditary osteodystrophy(pseudohypoparathyroidism) hypophosphatemic rickets Williams Beurensyndrome and renal coloboma syndrome. Lastly we identified 8 sets oflike sex twins in our family ascertainment efforts in CM1/S (7 female 1male) 7 of 8 are concordant for CM1 (one female twin pair is discordantfor CM1). 3 are concordant for associated syringomyelia. One unlike sextwin pair includes a female affected with CM1/S and a male unaffected. Provisional determinations of ls range from 4 21 across a broad range ofprevalence estimates. We hypothesize that the underlying gene or genesfor CM1/S will have pleiotropic effects influencing the extent of tonsillarherniation posterior fossa volume and/or other variables such as bonyabnormalities in the base of the skull and/or syringomyelia. These data areconsistent with a genetic hypothesis in at least a subset of CM1/S. ,2001
1385,Pulmonary fibrosis is rare form of lung disease that affects the interstitiumof the lungs and often fatal within 3 5 of diagnosis. Families with at leasttwo members affected by PF are recruited through a network of collabora tors and advertisement on the Internet (www.fpf.duke.edu). Data on affect ed members includes a standardized clinical history and risk factor ques tionnaire pedigree DLCO CXR HRCT and lung biopsy (when available).Asymptomatic relatives are screened with a questionnaire DLCO andCXR. Thirty families including 108 affected individuals have been identi fied. Males were more frequently affected than females (55%). The pre dominant race was Caucasian (94% Caucasian 6% Hispanic). Smokingwas identified in 42 % of cases with available data. Exposure to knownfibrotic agents such as asbestos silica or wood dust was recorded in 19%of cases. Mean age at diagnosis was 59 (sd=15.8) and mean age of deathwas 61 (sd=15.5). The diagnosis of PF was confirmed by an open lungbiopsy or autopsy in 24 patients (22%). A high resolution CT scan of thechest was obtained in 47 patients (43%). In the 24 families with at least 2documented cases PF occurred in multiple family members in 15 families. Ten families have at least one affected sibling pair 4 have affected parent child pairs including one pair of affected father and son and 4 pedigreesinclude more distantly related affected relative pairs. The familial aggrega tion documented in these families is consistent with a genetic basis in atleast a subset of PF cases. ,2001
1386,A genetic resource of DNA samples to support the study of autism in fam ilies where more than one child is affected or where one child is affectedand one demonstrates another significant and related developmental dis order has been built at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research in collab oration with the clinical services at the University of Medicine and DentistryRobert Wood Johnson Medical School. An open bank of anonymously col lected materials documented by a detailed clinical diagnosis forms thebasis of this growing database of information about the disease. Three cri teria were used to assess the autistic phenotype. These include the ADI(Autism Diagnostic Interview) the ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation al Schedule Generic) and the DSM IV Diagnostic Criteria for 299.00 Autis tic Disorder. All clinical interviews were conducted face to face. For eachdonor subject tested a representative Autistic Diagnostic Criteria ScoreSheet used to collect data is provided. Currently the resource contains 20families in which 41 individuals have been examined. Thirty three of theseindividuals have a diagnosis of autistic disorder by two or more criteria 28of these satisfy all three criteria. There are 20 affected sib pairs with a diag nosis of autistic disorder by two or more criteria 9 of these pairs meet thecriteria for autistic disorder by all three criteria.

1387,Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by defi ciencies in three domains reciprocal interaction communication andstereotyped/repetitive behaviour. Evidence for a strong genetic basis forthe disorder stems from twin studies and the increased rate of autism insiblings of autistic probands compared to the population prevalence. IMGSAC have previously published a whole genome screen for 36 sib pairs with a subset of 175 markers typed in a further 49 sib pairs and 3sibling trios. Five regions were identified with multipoint Maximum LodScore (MLS) > 1 (chromosomes 4 7 10 16 and 22). These regions havebeen characterised further and the results are presented here along withnew findings. A whole genome screen has now been carried out for 86 sib pairs using 394 microsatellites. A subset of 119 markers have been typedin 153 sib pairs in 12 regions giving a multipoint MLS above 0.80. ThreePosters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 359chromosomes generated a multipoint MLS above 3 after 153 sib pairs had been genotyped 2q 7q and 16p. Chromosome 2 gave the highest resultwith a multipoint MLS of 3.58 at D2S2188 followed by chromosome 7 atD7S477 with a multipoint MLS of 3.37 and then chromosome 16 with amultipoint MLS of 3.08 at D16S3102. Analysis of linkage data on the basisof sib pair proband status has been carried out and the parental origin ofalleles contributing to linkage was also investigated across the regionsstudied. ,2001
1388,Recent studies suggest that those complex diseases likely result from sev eral different aetiologies or a combination of pathological mechanisms. Thesearch we performed is based on the comprehensive multy disciplinaryevaluation which consisted of psychiatric examination of the child speechand language evaluation psychological testing and behaviorial assess ment. Those patients who met the ICD 10 criteria for autism hyperactiv ity disorder and specific language impairment and had a full scale IQ under70 performed a highly defined group (No 157) in which we undertook acytogenetic analyses. A systematic obstetric and developmental complica tions data family history and environmental factors were also obtained. Different medical conditions may be found in the developmental historiesof patients with those complex diseases and we proposed some importantdistinction versus control group (No 55 healthy infants followed up fiveyears after amniocentesis). On the contrary we found no scientific occur rence of chromosome abnormalities among probands in comparison withmatched control group. The objective of this review is to summarize ourfindings of the specifically contributing factors and their implications on theaetiology of those complex diseases. ,2001
1389,The results of several linkage studies have provided support for an autismsusceptibility locus on the long arm of chromosome 7. We report a girl withautistic features carrying a balanced translocation t(5 7)(q14 q34). Fluo rescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis with chromosome 7q specificYAC clones showed that the chromosome 7 breakpoint is located betweenmarkers D7S684 and D7S661. The region coincides with the candidateregion for autism on chromosome 7 from previous linkage studies. A BACclone of 82 kb spanning the translocation breakpoint was identified andthe breakpoint was mapped to 2 kb region within the BAC. Mutationscreening of the 2 genes closest to the breakpoint was performed in a setof 30 autistic patients. We found no sequence variant which predictsaminoacid alteration associated with the phenotype. Two polymorphicnucleotides were identified in one of the genes and the significance of thepolymorphism in autism remains to be clarified. Study of the methylationpattern of the breakpoint region failed to find any difference betweenpatient with the translocation and normal individuals. A positional effect ofthe translocation is not excluded and further investigation of the 7q methy lation pattern in the patient is in progress. ,2001
1390,Autism is a severe developmental disorder with an onset in early child hood characterized by marked social deficits deviant language and arestricted range of stereotyped repetitive behaviors. A genetic etiology isstrongly indicated by twin and family studies with a risk to siblings of idio pathic cases which is 75 times greater than the general population preva lence of 4/10 000 births. A two stage genome search by IMGSAC (1998)identified regions on six chromosomes (4 7 10 16 19 22) with the regionon chromosome 7q31 q35 as the most significant result (maximum multi point lod score (MLS) of 2.53). In a follow up fine mapping of chromosome7q was carried out by typing 104 additional markers in the interval D7S524 D7S483. Association studies using linkage disequilibrium analysis in theconsortium sib pair and the German singleton sample provided furthersupport for an autism susceptibility locus on chromosome 7q. In parallel screening of several neurotransmitter system genes located in othergenome regions were performed in the German singleton sample but didnot reveal a clear candidate. ,2001
1391,Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic componentas shown in family studies. The disease is characterized by impairments inreciprocal social interaction and communication together with restrictedand stereotyped patterns of interests and activities. The genetics of the dis order is complex probably involving the interaction of several genes. Theneurobiological basis of the disorder is unknown and there are no strongcandidate genes. Several genome screens were undertaken by differentautism consortia identifying different regions of interest defined by a mul tipoint maximum lod score (MLS) greater than 1. A region on chromosome7q31 35 was the most significant region (MLS of 2.53) identified first by theInternational Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC) which we are part of. Meanwhile four other genome screens were pub lished showing positive linkage on different chromosomal regions. The onlycommon region of all analyses remained on chromosome 7q. One possi bility to narrow down the candidate region and to identify new candidategenes are systematic karyotype analyses of autistic patients. One malepatient showed a duplication on chromosome 7q in 11% of leukocytes inperipheral blood and in approximately 40% of the nuclei in the correspon ding lymphoblastoid cell line. In order to determine the exact localizationand orientation of the duplication FISH experiments using several YACswere performed. ,2001
1392,"Autistic Disorder (AD) is categorized as a Pervasive Developmental Disor der (PDD) in DSM IV. Rett Disorder (RD) is also a PDD with unique clini cal features including microcephaly and loss of purposeful hand move ments followed by development of stereotyped repetitive hand move ments. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause RD. Because of the pheno typic similarity between RD and AD we screened 69 females in familiesascertained for AD gene mapping studies. Patients had a clinical diagno sis of AD confirmed using the ADI R. Patients with RD features such asmicrocephaly were excluded. Patients were screened using DHPLC todetect variants followed by sequencing. Two were found to have mutationsin the MECP2 gene. Patient one (age 10 years) developed normally untilage 30 months when she regressed in language and motor skills. Head cir cumference is at the 25th percentile. She did not lose purposeful handmovements and never developed RD stereotyped hand movements. Shehas a 880C>T relative to the start of the CDS nonsense mutation result ing in an R294Xaa change and premature protein truncation. Patient two(age 16 years) developed normally until 18 months when problems inresponse to social and language stimuli were noted. Head circumferenceis at the 50th percentile. She never developed RD sterotyped hand move ments. She is heterozygous for a 41 bp deletion at 1157 1197del resultingin a frameshift and protein truncation. Mutations in both patients are denovo.

Muta tions in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) and the presenilin genes(PSEN1/PSEN2) cause autosomal dominant early onset AD. The mostimportant genetic determinant for AD in the general population is theapolipoproteinE gene (APOE) which explains about 17% of the occurrenceof AD in the general population. Several genome wide studies identifiedregions of interest of which the chromosome 10 and 12 regions are themost promising. There is increasing interest in identifying genes in geneti cally isolated populations such as the Finnish and Icelandic populations. Inthis study we evaluated the feasibility of studying the genetics of AD in aDutch recently isolated population of 20 000 inhabitants. This populationwas founded 300 years ago by 150 subjects and is characterized by mini mal immigration. We ascertained 74 probable AD patients with a meanonset age of 73 years. The patient population comprised 65% females. Family history in first degree relatives was positive in 58%.

1393,Two relatively small genomic screens (n=54 Pericak Vance et al. JAMA1997 278 1237 1241 n=230 Kehoe et al. Hum Mol Gen 1999 8 237 245)have been published for late onset AD. These have identified severalpotential regions for novel AD genes including the as yet unidentified chro mosome 12 gene. However the modest sample sizes provided minimalpower to detect effects that might arise in only a subset of families. Weundertook the largest AD genomic screen to date using 455 families (fromDUMC VUMC UCLA IU and NIMH) a total of 726 affected sibpairs(ASPs). Over ? of these families have not been previously genotyped. Wehad sufficient sample size to examine the data independently in a subsetof autopsy confirmed (>1 autopsy confirmed case per family CONF) fam ilies. We used 2 point and multipoint parametric lod score and non para metric analyses. We identified several potential regions (n=14 MLOD orMLS > 1.00) as locations for novel AD genes. The most interesting novelregion is on 9p22 (MLOD = 3.45 MLS=3.30 in the overall and MLOD =3.97 MLS = 4.42 in the CONF). We also found evidence supporting therecently reported linkage to chromosome 10q22 (MLOD=2.65 MLS=2.12in the overall and MLOD=2.94 MLS=1.96 in the CONF. Linkage to 9p22was independent of APOE genotype. These data suggest chromosomes9p22 and 10q22 contain potential AD risk genes. Stratification by autopsyconfirmation strengthened the results of the linkage studies. Haplotype andcandidate gene analysis of the novel chromosome 9 region is ongoing andwill be presented. ,2001
1394,Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder forwhich several disease associated loci have been located on various chro mosomes. In order to find novel susceptibility genes for late onset AD wehave performed a population based genome wide search using linkagedisequilibrium (LD) mapping. To avoid population stratification 47 lateonset AD patients and 51 age matched controls were carefully chosenfrom the same geographical area in Eastern Finland. Initial genome widescreening with 366 polymorphic microsatellite markers revealed 22 chro mosomal loci associated with AD with P values in the range of 0.05 > P >0.001. Subsequent comparison of single allele frequencies of themicrosatellite markers in the AD and control groups indicated the presenceof risk alleles displaying suggestive association with AD (odds ratios rang ing from 2.0 to 6.3). In addition certain markers revealed significantly lowerfrequencies of particular alleles in the AD group than in the control groupsuggesting a protective effect conferred by these alleles against the devel opment of AD (odds ratios ranging from 0.0 to 0.4).

1395,Cystatin C is a cysteine protease inhibitor which is found to colocalize withAÃÂ§ in plaques and cerebrovascular deposits in Alzheimer s Disease (AD) cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and transgenic mouse models of AD. A mutation in the gene (CST3) enhances dimerization reduces biologicalactivity and causes hereditary Icelandic CAA. A common Ala/Thr substitu tion in the signal peptide has also been reported and we investigated thisvariant in a clinic and population based group of Caucasian AD cases(n=309 age range 60 90 mean 75.1) versus population based Caucasiancontrols (n=134 age range 60 90 years mean 76.1). Our data showed noassociation between AD and CST3 but the expected association of ADwith APOE e4 genotype. However logistic regression analyses revealed asignificant interaction between CST3 G/G status and age/age of onset onAD diagnosis (p=.003) suggesting that the genetic risk changes differen tially for CST3 as a function of age. We therefore stratified our samplebased on age (of controls) or age of onset (of cases) 60 69 70 79 and80+ years. In the youngest age groups an APOE e4 carrying genotypeconferred significant risk for AD (p<.001) while CST3 genotype was not asignificant risk (p>.18). In the oldest age group (controls n=49 cases n=79)the effect of APOE e4 carrying genotype on AD was not significant (p=.28) while CST3 genotype specifically the G/G homozygous genotype becomes a significant risk factor (p=.04) with an odds ratio of 2.2 com pared to A carrying genotypes. We further investigated this association inHispanic AD cases (n=146 age range 61 89 mean age of onset 72yrs)and controls (n=182 age range 60 90 mean age 70) and again found noassociation between CST3 and AD in the total Hispanic dataset but a ten dency towards an increase in the GG genotype in cases versus controls inthe over 80 dataset. These data suggest that variation at the cystatin Clocus is a novel risk factor for late onset Alzheimer s disease particularlyat an age when APOE genotype no longer confers increased risk. It is like ly that variation at this locus or one with which it is in linkage disequilibri um confers risk for AD via effects on cystatin C trafficking and/or function contributing to vascular AD pathology and possible exacerbation of ÃÂ§ amy loid pathogenic mechanisms. ,2001
1396,The major hallmark of Alzheimer s disease (AD) pathology is beta amyloid(Abeta) deposition in the brain. Three protease activities named alpha Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 361beta and gamma secretase are crucial in the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate Abeta. Recently the beta sec retase was identified and named beta site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE).Since all known familial early onset AD (EOAD) related mutations in APPand presenilin (PSEN) increase Abeta production by affecting one of thesecretase activities we hypothesized that genetic variations within BACEmight be similarly involved in the etiology of EOAD. We performed genet ic linkage analyses in families of 9 autosomal dominant probands that hadno mutation in APP or PSEN using markers D11S1327 D11S939 D11S1336 located near BACE. No family showed conclusive linkage andin 3 families linkage with BACE was excluded. cDNA and genomic muta tion analysis revealed no mutations except for a frequent silent c.786C>Gpolymorphism (V262) and a c.840+5G>T variation at the fifth nucleotide ofintron 5 that was observed in only 1 patient. Next the V262 polymorphismwas analyzed in a sample of 101 presenile AD patients and 185 controlsubjects. Allele and genotype distributions were not significantly different incases and controls. Also no differences were found when the sample wasstratified for positive family history or the presence of an APOE4 allele. Together these results show that BACE is not genetically involved in theetiology of EOAD. ,2001
1397,Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1) gene on chromosome 14 areknown to cause familial early onset Alzheimer s disease (AD). Over 70 dif ferent PSEN 1 mutations have been found so far and the highly penetrantPSEN 1 gene mutations are more frequent cause of AD than mutations intwo other early onset AD genes PSEN 2 and amyloid precursor protein. Here we present our PSEN 1 screening results among Finnish early onsetAD patients. The major findings were as follows We identified a novel 4.6 kb genomic deletion in PSEN 1 in an early onset AD family (mean onsetage 43 years) which leads to an inframe exclusion of exon 9 from themRNA transcript. The clinical and neuropathological features of patients inthis family resembled those of the typical AD (Hiltunen et al. EJHG (2000)8 259 266). We also found a missense mutation P264L in exon 8 in anearly onset AD family (mean onset age 54 years). In addition E318G sub stitution was found in AD patients and controls indicating that this substitu tion is noncausative for AD. However the allele frequency of the E318Gvariant was significantly increased in both familial (P = 0.005 OR 7.6 nan,2001
1398,The frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1 alleles has beendetermined in a cohort of 194 Kuwaiti Arabs consisting of 80 schizophre nia patients and 114 ethnically matched healthy controls using a poly merase chain reaction sequence specific primers (PCR SSP) method. Atotal of twelve DRB1 alleles were identified in this Kuwaiti cohort. A statis tically significant difference was detected in the frequency of allelesDRB1*04 and DRB1*13 between the schizophrenia patients and controls. Allele frequency of DRB1*04 in schizophrenia patients was 14 % com pared to nearly 7 % in controls (P = 0.028). For DRB1*13 the allele fre quency was found to be 18 % in schizophrenia patients compared to 9 %in the controls (P = 0.015). For alleles DRB1*03 DRB1*07 and DRB1*16 the frequency was higher in controls compared to the schizophreniapatients. The frequency of DRB1*01 DRB1*08 DRB1*10 DRB1*11 andDRB1*15 alleles was almost identical in schizophrenia patients and con trols. For the remaining alleles the differences amongst the two groupswere not statistically significant. ,2001
1399,"Schizophrenia is a serious and debilitating psychiatric disorder with a life time prevalence of 1%. Neuroleptics are the mainstay of treatment butlong term use may result in the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD).Besides age and cumulative neuroleptic dosage the incidence of TD ishigher among patients with a family history of mental illness indicating thepresence of genetic susceptibility factors. We genotyped 97 healthy controls and 221 patients with schizophrenia (87with TD 134 without) for the 5 HTR2A T102C polymorphism by PCR RFLP. Between controls and patients there was an excess of the T con taining genotypes but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was also little difference at the allelic level. Among the patients there was an excess of the T/T genotype for the TDgroup compared to those without TD (c 2=6.517 df=2 p=0.038). There was also significant difference in allele frequencies between the two groups(c 2=4.189 df=1 p=0.044) with the odds ratio of 1.54 (95% CI=1.02 2.33). For genotype distribution the significance level is lower (p=0.055) afteradjusting for age and daily neuroleptic dose in CPZ eq. Significant differ ence in allele frequency remains even after adjusting for the two significantvariables (p=0.041) with the odds ratio at 1.64 (95% CI=1.02 2.62). The C allele has been associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia andnon responsiveness to clozapine. Our results showed that it might also beassociated with increased risk for neuroleptic induced TD. This polymor phism might thus be a useful marker to screen for patients who might beat higher risk of developing TD.362 Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex InheritanceP1339. On the role for glutamate in the pathogenesis of schiz ophrenia association study with the N methyl D aspartatereceptor 2B E. Di Maria1 R. Gulli1 S. Begni2 R. Pioli2 E. Bellone1 F. Ajmar1 M. Gennarelli2 P. Mandich1 1University of Genova Genova Italy 2I. R.C. C.S. Fatebenefratelli Brescia I', 'Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Its action is mediated by different classes of ionotropic receptors. Amongthem the N methyl D aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are involved in neu ronal plasticity and in glutamate excitotoxicity. The pathophysiologicalmodel of NMDAR mediated glutamate hypofunction as a mechanism lead ing to the development of schizophrenia is supported by the evidences thatadministration of non competitive NMDAR antagonists trigger psychoticsymptoms in schizophrenic patients and induce psychotic like behavioursin normal subjects. Functional NMDARs are composed of the ubiquitousNR1 subunit and one of four NR2 subunits. The 2B subunit gene namedGRIN2B is expressed in human brains in the hyppocampus basal gangliaand cerebral cortex. We tested the hypothesis that a certain genetic back ground of the NMDAR2B is associated with susceptibility to develop schiz ophrenia. The genomic sequence of the GRIN2B gene was inferred fromthe known cDNA sequence through in silico analysis. Subsequently threeinformative polymorphisms were identified a silent G/C single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) in exon 12 (SNP2664) a C/T SNP in the 3 UTR(SNP890) a multiallelic short tandem repeat (STR) in intron 2 (D12S364).Allele and genotype frequencies were estimated on a series of 105 unre lated patients with schizophrenia (DSM IV) and on 150 normal controls. Nosignificant difference between patients and controls was observed in alleleand genotype frequencies of SNP2664 and D12S364. The T allele ofSNP890 was found to be less frequent in patients than in controls (p<0.05) resulting an odds ratio associated with the G/G genotype equal to 3.39.These results did not allow to reject the hypothesis of association betweenthe NMDAR2B genetic background and the susceptibility to schizophrenia. In order to confirm the preliminary analysis the case control study on theextended haplotypes is in progress. nan",2001
1400, u.ac.jpThe human dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) is of major interest in molecu lar studies of schizophrenia because an atypical antipsychotic drug cloza pine has a relatively high affinity to DRD4 (Van Tol et al. 1991) and ele vations in the density of DRD4 and DRD4 mRNA expression were foundpostmortem in the brains of schizophrenia patients (Seeman et al. 1993 Stefanis et al. 1998). Many polymorphisms have been reported in theDRD4 gene locus. Previously we have reported 9 novel polymorphisms (7single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2 insertion/deletion polymor phisms) in the upstream region of the DRD4 gene in the Japanese popu lation (Mitsuyasu et al. 1999). We genotyped 5 of the polymorphismsincluding one known RFLP in 208 Japanese schizophrenia patients and210 normal controls (Mitsuyasu et al. 2001 in press). Including these wecollected 22 SNPs and 6 other polymorphisms (repeat polymorphisms 4 deletion polymorphisms 2) from a 4.9 kb region of entire DRD4 gene based on our experiments database and literatures. Most of them wereclustered within an approximately 1 kb area containing exon 1 and the pro moter region. In this study we report evaluation of these polymorphismsand genotyping of them using the Japanese schizophrenia patients andnormal controls above mentioned. The methods adopted in the evaluationand genotyping were PLACE SSCP (Inazuka et al. 1997) singlenucleotide extension RFLP and direct sequencing of PCR products. Weanalyzed the linkage disequilibria between these polymorphisms and theassociation between these polymorphisms and schizophrenia patients inJapanese population. ,2001
1401, wuerzburg.deWe have recently reported a 5 cM region on chromosome 22q13.33 withsuggestive evidence for linkage with familial catatonic schizophrenia( periodic catatonia according to Leonhard s classification St ber et al. AJHG 67 1201 1207 2000). The region has been reduced to at least 4 cMby genotyping additional polymorphic markers. Gene annotation in thisregion shows a total of 30 genes and 47 small transcripts of viral origin ordetected very rarely in cDNA libraries. One of the the strong candidategenes in this region is CELSR1 a gene encoding a neuronal seven passtransmembrane receptor cadherin. Routing branching and final destina tion of developing neurons is mediated by cell surface proteins and mem bers of the cadherin cell adhesion protein family such as CELSRI. We havestudied CELSR1 in detail and found a number of allelic variants within thecoding region. Additionally a polymorphic intronic repeat has been detect ed. These variants provide a powerful tool to investigate the role ofCELSR1 in the etiopathogenesis of complex psychiatric disorders. Someof the other genes with unknown function in this region are expressedexclusively in the brain. Further studies will show if the variants of thesegenes detected so far may alter brain function and contribute to the patho genesis of psychiatric disorders. Comparative sequencing of the codingregions of candidate genes in this chromosomal region may lead to thedetection of a major gene involved in the etiopathogenesis of schizophre nia. ,2001
1402,Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder which affects 1% of the gen eral polulation. The aetiology is not known but neuroleptic drugs improvethe symptoms in the majority of patients. These drugs block the dopaminereceptors in the brain and therefore dopamine is supposed to play a role inthe pathophysiology of the disease. The Dopamine transporter genePosters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 363(DAT1) encodes a protein which re uptakes synaptic dopamine making it a stong candidate gene to study in schizophrenia. A 40 bp VNTR in the3 UTR of the gene has been exmined in previous case control studies butno positive results were found. We used the more robust method of familycontrols from parent offspring trios to test for association with disease. We genotyped 178 trios with Schizophrenia (SZ) of Bulgarian origin. Theresults were analysed with the Extended Transmission Disequilibrium Test. We observed alleles of 5 6 8 9 10 and 11 repeats of the VNTR. The allelefrequencies and transmissions from heterozygous parents are shown inthe table. We confirm previous results that the VNTR in DAT1 does not increase sus ceptibility for schizophrenia. We examined the data sample for correlation between DAT1 genotypesand certain characteristics of auditory hallucinations which are among themost important clinical features of Schizophrenia. We found a statisticallysignificant positive correlation between DAT1 genotype and the severity ofvoices reported by patients Spearman s rho=0.183 p=0.01 n=176 how ever this result is not corrected for multiple testing. By now the importanceof this relationship is unclear. We suggest that the occurrence of allele 10could modify the severity of certain symptoms of Schizophrenia. Table 1. Allele frequencies ,2001
1403, bonn.deGenetic epidemiology has provided consistent evidence that schizophreniahas a genetic component and that this genetic component is complex. Molecular genetic studies however have so far failed to reproducibly iden tify any DNA variant conferring susceptibility to this common neuropsychi atric disorder. Recently the NOTCH4 locus on chromosomal region 6p hasbeen reported to be highly associated with schizophrenia in the British pop ulation [Wei & Hemmings Nature Genet. 25 376 377 (2000)]. This locuscontains the gene encoding the NOTCH4 receptor which is involved inneurodevelopmental processes. Because credibility of association findingsin genetically complex traits strongly depends on replication in independ ent samples we examined four variants [(TAA)n repeat SNP1 SNP2 (CTG)n repeat] in the 5 flanking region and in the coding region of theNOTCH4 gene in parent offspring trio samples from two different popula tions 159 trios of German and 209 trios of Palestinian Arab descent. Link age disequilibrium analysis was performed using the transmission disequi librium test (TDT). In concordance with the British trio sample we found asusceptibility locus for schizophrenia in significant linkage disequilibriumwith the (TAA)n repeat in the Palestinian Arab sample (p=0.0082) andobserved a borderline significant trend in the German sample (p=0.0547).Furthermore the four marker haplotype (TAA)n SNP1 SNP2 (CTG)n wasassociated in both German (p=0.0038) and Palestinian Arab (p=0.0111)trio samples. Thus our results provide further support for the hypothesisthat the NOTCH4 gene or a nearby locus is involved in the etiology ofschizophrenia. ,2001
1404, Bipolar disorder is a severe neuropsychiatric condition that affects approx imately 1% of the U. S. population. The condition is complex with a stronggenetic influence. The objective of this study was (1) to assess the famil iality of bipolar disorder in South Africa (2) to assess the significance ofassociation of other psychiatric disorders with bipolar disorder (in a famil ial setting) and (3) to identify the possible genetic loci which predispose tobipolar disorder in the families under investigation. A total of 130 familieswere recruited who met the criteria for a diagnosis of either bipolar I dis order (BPI) bipolar II disorder (BPII) or major depressive episode recurrent(MDE R) as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IVAxis I disorders (Version 2.0). In a review of the 130 families BPI was seento cluster with BPII and MDE. Compared to males a greater number offemales with a mood disorder were observed. 51% of the cohort met thecriteria for BPI and BPII 44% for MDE (recurrent and single) and 5% forother mood disorders. 19% of the cohort failed to meet the criteria for anyof the mood disorders. Current molecular genetic analysis involves screen ing a cohort of 12 South African families with fluorescent microsatellitemarkers covering a comprehensive set of candidate loci/genes thought toplay a role in the aetiology of bipolar disorder. It is likely that similar/com mon genetic factors underlie mood disorders and other psychiatric condi tions. ,2001
1405,Genetic linkage studies in psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder (BPD)have been complicated by extensive genetic and phenotypic heterogene ity. One way to maximize the power of linkage analysis is to identifyendophenotypes that may predict the genetic basis of a phenotypic subset. Several studies suggest an increased prevalence of MRI hyperintense fociin BPD these foci are located in both subcortical white matter and greynuclei. Between 25 40% of young bipolars (< 45 years) demonstrate theseMRI findings which are similar to those in CADASIL (cerebral autosomaldominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) which has been associated with mutations in Notch3. We identified a largepedigree in which all 9 BPD patients were positive for MRI hyperintensefoci 6/10 relatives with no affective disorder were also positive for theseMRI changes. Linkage analysis (parametric and non parametric) usingmarkers flanking Notch3 demonstrated negative lod scores across a vari ety of disease models except for slightly positive lod scores for D19S923when all MRI lesion positive individuals regardless of BPD status areaffected (z(q) ] 0.86). Since Notch3 is a compelling functional candidate we investigated exons 3 and 4 where mutations in CADASIL cluster withSSCP. We found no evidence for gel shift in these two exons providing fur ther evidence that this gene is not involved in either the bipolar or MRI phe notype in this family. In addition to this large family we have identified twoother sets of sib pairs concordant for BPD and hyperintense foci and fur ther investigations are on going. ,2001
1406,Several studies have provided evidence of a susceptibility locus for bipo lar disorder on chromosome 22q. We analysed 18 Bulgarian pedigreeswith affective disease for linkage with 4 polymorphic markers from 22q(D22S427 COMT D22S264 D22S278) covering 17.4 cM. Two point link age analysis under assumption of homogeneity and a dominant model withreduced penetrance produced small positive values only for markerD22S278 with maximum Lod=1.12 for marker D21S278 (q=0.05) and broad phenotype definition. Nonparametric linkage analysis under a phe notype model including bipolar I II and schizoaffective disorder gave pos itive NPLall values (p<0.05) over the distal part of the studied region peakat D21S278 (Npl Zall=1.73 p=0.02). The multipoint Lod score analysis performed by GENEHUNTER produced small positive score at the samelocus (Lod=0.63). The transmission disequilibrium test was applied andpreferential transmission could not be found for the analysed markers. Thecombined data does not support the hypothesis for the role of COMT andthe adjacent region in the susceptibility to affective disorder in the analysedsample. The significant NPL scores and small positive Lod scores at locusD22S278 confirm previous findings and focus the attention on the distalpart of chromosome 22q for further investigations. ,2001
1407,There is compelling evidence that serotonin system dysfunction is associ ated with certain behavioral disorders such as suicidal behavior andimpulsive aggression. A functional polymorphism in the promoter region ofthe serotonin transporter gene (5 HTTLPR) was recently identified and thepresence of the short allele found to be associated with a lower level ofexpression of the gene lower levels of 5 HT uptake suicidal behavior andanxiety related traits. We genotyped 51 West European Caucasians whohad made violent suicide attempts and 139 controls of the same ethnic ori gin with no history of suicidal behavior. The frequencies of the S allele andthe SS genotype were significantly higher in the violent suicide attemptersthan in the controls. The odds ratio for the SS genotype vs. the LL geno type was 3.63 (95% CI [1.27 10.40]). The association was even stronger inthose with a history of major mood disorder (odds ratio for SS genotype vs. LL genotype 5.6 95% (CI [1.36 23.06]) whereas no difference wasobserved between non suicide attempters with and without a history ofmajor mood disorder. This suggests that a change in expression of thegene encoding the 5 HT transporter may be involved in a subgroup of sui cide attempters in whom violent suicidal behavior is combined with majormood disorder. Possible interaction between 5 HTTLPR and other genesof the serotonin pathway in these behavioral disorders will be presented. ,2001
1408,Background. The human Serotonin transporter gene (5 HTT) is a strong candidate for involvement in the pathogenesis of mood disorders as it isthe target of antidepressants blocking the re uptake of Serotonin. Previousstudies have proposed that certain alleles of a 16/17bp VNTR in intron 2 might increase susceptibility to Bipolar affective disorder 1 (BP1). Associ ation studies using case control designs can however produce spuriousresults. We used the more robust method of family controls from parent offspring trios. Methods. We genotyped 255 trios of Bulgarian origin. The distribution of DSM IV diagnoses in the affected offspring is as follows BP1 72 families Schizophrenia (SZ) 157 families Schizoaffective disorder (SA) 26 fami lies. The results were analysed with the Extended Transmission Disequi librium Test. Results. We observed alleles of 9 10 and 12 repeats of the VNTR. The frequencies are shown in the table. For the whole sample the 9 repeat waspassed 9 times not passed 7 times (c2=0.25 p=0.6) allele 10 was passed110 times v. 129 times (c2=1.51 p=0.2) and allele 12 was passed 130times v. 113 times (c2=1.19 p=0.3). None of the three diagnostic samplesshowed significant preferential transmission of any alleles. Some but notall previous studies reported that allele 12 is more common in patients withBPI (Kirov et al Psychol Med 1999 29 1249 54). The only trend for the 12 repeat to be preferentially transmitted was in SA disorder (passed 17 notpassed 10 times c2=1.82 p=0.178). There was no significant correlationbetween the presence of allele 12 and any of the psychiatric symptomsrecorded. Conclusions. We could not confirm previous results that the 12 repeat in the VNTR in intron 2 in 5 HTT increases susceptibility to nan,2001
1409,Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a complex neuropsychiatric disor der characterized by multiple motor and phonic tics. We identified a malepatient with GTS and other additional anomalies carrying a de novo dupli cation of the long arm of chromosome 7 [46 XY dup(7)(q22.1 q31.1)]. Thedistal chromosomal breakpoint occurred between the two markers D7S515and D7S522 a region previously shown to be disrupted in a familiar caseof GTS. Sequence analysis of the distal breakpoint determined that therearrangement occurred within a novel gene named mitochondrial innerpeptidase subunit 2 (IMP2) due to its similarity to yeast nan,2001
1410,We have previously reported association of the +118A allele of the humanmu opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) with alcohol dependency in a popula tion recruited through the Veterans Administration. However other geneticassociation studies investigating the role of this functional polymorphism inrisk for alcohol dependency have produced inconsistent findings possiblybecause of the failure to recognize sampling methodology difficulties inher ent in association studies of polygenic disorders. We therefore examinedthe frequency of the AA genotype and A allele in several groups of sub stance dependent cases unscreened controls and super controlsscreened for the use of alcohol and cigarettes. Our findings and analysessuggest that the OPRM1 +118 polymorphism is a general risk gene forsubstance dependence but is not specific to a particular substance. Thenature of the conferred risk is likely to be in use of multiple substances butit is not yet determined if the risk could be expressed in severity of use ofany particular substance. The contribution of the gene to risk for substancedependence is small and is detected most easily in studies that use con trol samples that are screened for all forms of substance dependence. ,2001
1411,The angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) is key element of the renin angiotensin system. However data on relative contributions of alleles andgenotypes of this gene into vascular disorders and survival are contradic tory. We have investigated the frequency of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D)polymorphism in 4 group of subjects living in Moscow a sample of children(mean age is 2.9+3.4 y.o) and 3 samples of adults aged 30 80 years (means age are 34.2+2.37 56.4+4.5 83.17+3.39 y.o). We observed thetendency of increased the frequency D allele (p<0.05) and DD genotype(p<0.01) in centenarians. For example a frequency of D allele was 0 48 forchildren group and 0 68 for centenarians group. Such results can havepopulation specific effect. Thus genotype differences between age groupshould be taken into account and the control group thoroughly selectedwhen association are studied. ,2001
1412,The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion poly morphism may play a role of genetic marker of physical performance andathletic excellence (Montgomery et al. 1998 Gayagay et al. 1998). How ever Rankinen et al. (2000) and Taylor et al. (1999) do not confirm thishypothesis. In this study was examined possible association of the ACEgene insertion (I) and deletion (D) allele frequencies and ACE genotypes(II ID DD) with sport specialization in Russian athletes on different sportlevels. Athletes specialized in swimming track and field triathlon and skiparticipated in the study. All athletes was divided into three groups. Thegroup A consisted of sprinters who make their competition load into 1minute. The group B consist of athletes who make competition load in timeperiod from 1 to 20 minutes. And the group C included marathoners whoperform their competition load during more then 20 minutes. Moreover theathletes was classified as middle level athletes standing (members andcandidates of Russian national teams) and outstanding (champions ofRussia Europe and higher level) athletes. DNA was extracted from buccalepithelia. The ACE I/D polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chainreaction as reported earlier (Evans et al. 1994). Significance was assessedby chi squared analysis. The results of this investigation are shown in thetable 1. It is seen from the table 1 that at the middle and the standing ath letes there are no significant differences of the ACE genotypes or I/D alle les frequencies in all groups compared to control group. However signifi cant increase of the D allele was detected among outstanding sprinters(group A). It accords to data that the response to strength training effect isincreased by the presence of the D allele in ACE genotype (Folland et al. 2000). Significant increase of the I allele is detected among outstandingathletes of group B. This possibly can be explained by some preferenceowing to better oxygen delivery to skeletal muscles during exercises atsubmaximal intensity. This point is confirmed that among marathonerswas not found significant association with frequencies of ACE gene I andD alleles so as an intensity of physical load in this group lower and theoxygen delivery rate is not limiting factor for their exercising.

1413,Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE kininase II EC 3.4.15.1) plays anessential role in the maintenance of vascular tone as it activatesangiotensin I to the vasoconstrictory peptide angiotensin II and inacti vates the vasodilatory peptide bradykinin. Variations in the levels of ACEhave been reported in different individuals and are related to occurance ofdifferent alleles of ACE gene. A well studied polymorphism in the intron 16of the ACE gene due to insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287 bp sequencehas been reported to occur producing three genotypes DD DI and II. Thehighest ACE levels occur in individuals with DD genotype and the lowest inthe II homozygous. We investigated ACE polymorphism in 300 Saudimales and females. Primers spanning the polymorphic site in intron 16 ofACE gene were used to amplify the polymorphic site by PCR and the PCRproduct was subjected to agarose gell electrophoresis. Based on the frag ments produced each individual was classified as DD ID and II and the fre quency of each genotype and the D and I alleles were determined in themales and females. The overall genotype frequency was 0.560 0.026 and0.414 for DD II and ID genotypes while the allele frequency were 0.767and 0.233 for D and I alleles. The individuals with different genotypes wereseperated and the prevalence of hypertension was calculated in eachgroup. In addition prevalence of obesity and serum lipid abnormalities wereinvestigated in each genotype. This paper will present our findings of ACEgene polymorphism in normotensive and hypertensive Saudi individualsand will discuss the role of ACE in the development of hypertension. ,2001
1414,The several genes that together predispose individuals to essential hyper tension are unknown. Abnormalities in the dopaminergic system whichoccur in rat models of hypertension are implicated in human hypertension. Dopamine produces several effects such as the control of renal vasomo tor tone and natriuresis and regulation of the secretion of renin angiotensin and aldosterone. The effects are mediated through two class es of receptors D2/D3/D4 and D1/ nan,2001
1415,Family and twins study demonstrated that genetic factors may be involvedin stroke. Previously insertion/deletion (I/D) Alu polymorphism in theangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene and M235T polymorphism inthe angiotensinogen gene has been suggested as a risk factors for somecardiovascular diseases. There fore cardiovascular factors are well knownrisk factors for ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD). We have inves tigated the distribution of alleles of ACE and angiotensinogen genes ingroup of patients with ischaemic and their sibs. All patients and sibs withischaemic stroke were investigated for the stenosis of the internal carotidartery (CS). There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the distributionof ACE alleles homozygosity for the presumed susceptibility deletion allelebeing more common in patients with profound (>50%) CS than in healthycontrol subjects and healthy sibs. There was also a significant difference(P < 0.05) in patients with CS in comparison with matched ICVD patientswithout CS both in allelic frequencies and in homozygosity for the deletionallele. However I\\D allele distibution demonstrated no evidence for statis tically significant differences in frequencies of I/D alleles or II/DD/ID geno types between ICVD patients and healthy control subjects. Our results indi cate that the ACE gene polymorphism may be a risk factor for the devel opment of CS but not for ICVD. M235T angiotensinogen gene polymor phism is not risk factor for ICVD or CS in our patient s group we don t findany significant differences in allele and genotype distribution betweenICVD and CS patients and healthy control subjects. ,2001
1416, i.nhs.ukBackground elevations in plasma homocysteine levels are associated withIHD. A C677T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene results in reduced folate dependent enzyme activity and reduced methylation of homocysteine tomethionine. The homozygous (TT) mutant genotype is associated withmild hyperhomocysteinemia particularly in those populations with lowplasma folate levels. There is controversy as to whether the TT genotypeis associated with an increased risk of IHD and theoretically it may evenprotect against endothelial damage. Aims to investigate the presence of linkage disequilibrium between theC677T MTHFR polymorphism and IHD in a well defined population. Methods A total of 129 families were recruited (353 individuals). The pres ence of linkage disequilibrium between the C677T MTHFR polymorphismand IHD was tested for using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) /sib TDT and pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT). These tests are unaffect ed by population admixture. We tested for excess transmission of the C orT allele to affected individuals using two tailed tests. Results TDT / sib TDT 47 of 112 discordant sibships and 12 of 20 trioswere informative (one sibship or trio per family). There was a statisticallyPosters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 367significant excess transmission of the C allele to affected individuals (p=0.016). PDT 59 families were informative. There was a statistically significantexcess transmission of the C allele to affected individuals (p=0.021). Conclusion using newly developed family based association methods wehave demonstrated excess transmission of the C allele to individualsaffected with IHD suggesting that the T allele may be protective againstIHD. ,2001
1417,Mitochondrial DNA is a very variable locus of human genome. Traditional ly mtDNA polymorphisms are considered as neutral especially those innoncoding regions. We have studied restriction polymorphism in D loop ofmtDNA and V region length polymorphism in several Siberian populationsas well as some affected groups (hypertension heart blocks complicatedpregnancy). Several traits concerning cardiovascular system function alsohave been investigated in the samples (blood pressure lipid levels ECGparameters) By comparing allele frequencies we have found some signif icant (P<0.05) differences in the HaeIII 16517 frequency between case andethnically matched controls in Buryats with complicated pregnancy (42%vs 62% in controls) and in Russians with heart blocks (77% vs 58% in con trols). Also this polymorphism contributes in blood pressure variability inhealthy Tuvinian population with HaeIII+ individuals having lower bloodpressure levels. V region length polymorphism contributes in ECG inter vals and peaks variability in Tuvinians (PQ QT RR ratio) where individu als harboring deletion or insertion in this region have lower values of theseparameters. Some differences were revealed also for haplotype frequen cies. These findings suggest possible involving of mtDNA in the function ofcardiovascular system and allow it to be considered as susceptibility locusfor common cardiovascular diseases. In particular non coding polymor phisms which were investigated may also have functional consequences. Major noncoding region of human mtDNA contains regulatory elementswhich are necessary for mtDNA expression. Hence sequence polymor phisms may change the structure of these elements that in turn con tributes to mitochondrial function alterations. ,2001
1418, halle.deTNF a a potent cytokine plays an important role in atherosclerotic devel opment and could been identified in many tissues involved in the progres sion of atherosclerosis. Interested in the effect of genetic variants of TNF a on CAD we investigated 5 polymorphic sites (C 863A C 857T G 308A G 238A and A+1312G) in 234 patients (76 6% male mean 50 3y) withangiographically proven severe CAD and 161 healthy controls (63% male mean 42 3 y). The patient group was analyzed regarding age at 1.MI(<=or>=45y) survival time after 1.MI (<=or>=1y) number of affected ves sels (1or more) and therapy (PTCA or ACVB). C 863A we found a signifi cantly increased frequency of A allele carriers (dominant model for mutantA allele) in the patient group with 1 vessel disease compared to patientswith 2 or more affected vessels (0 4 vs. 0 2 p<0 02). G 308A the fre quency of A allele carriers (dominant model for mutant A allele) was sig nificantly increased in the patient group with MI (0 297 vs. 0 197 p<0 05)compared with healthy controls. G 238A MI patients who had the 1.MI<=45y have significantly increased frequency of A allele carriers (domi nant model for mutant A allele) compared with MI patients who had the1.MI >45y (0 162 vs. 0 049 p<0 02). A+1312G the patient group with 1 vessel disease had a significantly decreased frequency of mutant G allelecarriers (dominant model for the mutant G allele) compared to patientswith 2 or more affected vessels (0 057 vs. 0 192 p<0 02). Our results sug gest an assoziation of genetic variants of TNF a to the progress and sever ity of CAD and should be considered in the genetic risk profile of CAD. ,2001
1419,Numerous studies demonstrated that CAD is associated with mild hyper homocysteinemia. Plasma homocysteine concentrations are modulated inpart by variants in genes coding for enzymes of the methionine cycle. Weperformed a case control study to analyze the role of 7 variants in select ed genes of the methionine cycle cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) methionine synthase (MS)and methionine synthase reductase (MSR). We genotyped 591 healthycontrols (48% men median age 50 range 18 65 years) and 296 patientswith coronarographically verified CAD (82% men median age 56 range33 65 years) using ARMS PCR. All subjects underwent standard methion ine loading test their fasting and post load concentrations of aminothiolswere determined by HPLC method. The calculated odds ratios (and 95%confidence interval) for the rare variants in each locus are as follows MSR524 TT vs. CT+CC 1.05 (0.7 1.57) MSR66 GG vs. AG+AA 0.94(0.68 1.28) MS2756 GG vs. AG+AA 1.32 (0.64 2.68) MTHFR1298 CCvs. AC+AA 0.78 (0.45 1.32) MTHFR677 TT vs. CT+CC 1.37 (0.87 2.15) heterozygosity for CBS844ins68bp vs. CBS844del/del 0.53 (0.33 0.85 p=0.005). The impact of the 844ins68 on aminothiol concentrations wasassessed by non parametric test the heterozygotes for 844ins68 hadinsignificantly lower fasting and postload concentrations of plasma homo cysteine and fasting blood glutathione the median post load decrease ofplasma cysteine concentrations was 23 and 15 micromol/l in del/del andins/del individuals respectively (Man Whitney p= 0.0002). Our data showthat the 844ins68 variant is associated with a significantly decreased riskof coronary artery disease its mechanism remains obscure and may bemediated through modulation of cysteine metabolism. ,2001
1420,We have investigated the PAI 1 4G/5G polymorphism in different group ofmyocardial infarction (MI) patients and controls. Group 1 289 male MIpatients (mean age 60 years) were collected from emergency departmentduring 1 2 days after acute MI. Group 2 100 male patients with MI before45 years (mean age 41 years) were recruited from Medical University Clin ic at least 6 months after their MI. As a control group 284 randomly sam pled schoolchildren were used. A prevalence of the 5G allele in MI group 1compared to controls was found (p<0.001). In MI group 2 higher frequen cy of the 4G/4G genotype compared to control subjects was determined(p<0.01). The comparison of 4G/5G alleles distribution between MI group1 and 2 showed a strong prevalence of 5G allele in MI patients collectedduring 1 2 days after their MI. Recently Heymans S. et al. (Nat. Med. 1999)found out that exogenic expression of PAI 1 in mice could prevent cardiacrupture. Such differences in the PAI 1 alleles distribution among MIpatients who were taken into analysis during different time period aftertheir MI allow us to make a following conclusion MI patients carrying the4G allele of the PAI 1 gene and accordingly higher PAI 1 levels couldhave more chances to get rid of such MI complication as a cardiac rupture. But this supposition requires more detailed prospective study concerningsurvival after MI. ,2001
1421,Prevalent mutations in the lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) Asn291Ser andAsp9Asn had been shown to be associated with increased plasma triglyc 368 Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritanceerides and decreased HDL cholesterol whereas Ser447Ter on the contrary with decreased triglycerides and increased HDL cholesterol levels. Hencethese variations may affect cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study wasto investigate the frequency of these substitutions in the LPL gene inmyocardial infarction (MI) survivors (cases) and in the general population(controls) and to examine whether the carriers of Asn291Ser and Asp9Asnare at an increased risk of MI. We examined 158 cases (males survivedafter MI before 45 years) and 124 controls. The frequencies of mutationscarriers in the cases were 3 8% for Asn291Ser 0 6% for Asp9Asn and16 4% for Ser447Ter and in the controls 0 8% 1 6% and 19 4% respec tively. All differences between the groups were not significant. Thus ourresults did not confirm the role of investigated LPL gene mutations in mod ulation of MI risk. ,2001
1422,Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the main cause of mortality and mor bidity in developed countries. The role of genetic factors is thought to bemore likely in premature MI. We studied the Q191R and L54M polymor phisms of the paraoxonase (PON1) gene and the C677T mutation of themethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in 216 men survivedafter MI at the age of 45 years. The age marched control group consists of157 unrelated healthy men from the same community. PON1 is a high den sity lipoprotein associated enzyme capable of hydrolysing lipid peroxides. C677T MTHFR is responsible for reduced MTHFR activity and associatedwith increase in plasma homocysteine levels. The genotype distributionsand allele frequencies of the L54M PON1polymorphism and C677TMTHFR did not differ in patients compared to the controls. The genotypedistributions of the Q191R PON1 polymorphism were significantly differentbetween the groups (?2=8.85 df=2 P<0.01). The R191 allele (B allele)was significantly increased in patients (?2=8.62 df=1 P<0.003). The oddsratio of MI for subjects homozygous for the R191 allele was 3.3 [95% CI 1.46 7.34] compared to the Q allele carriers. The paraoxonase B isotypemight not protect well against lipid oxidation a major atherogenic pathway. Thus the RR genotype of the PON1 gene may be considered to be anindependent risk factor for MI in men at the age of 45 years. ,2001
1423,Factor V leiden (FVL) and prothrombin 20210A (FII20210A) were suggest ed as candidate risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) based on anassociation with increased thrombotic tendency. A common polymorphism FXIII V34L has recently been associated with a protect role against thepathogenesis of MI. However some studies have reported conflictingresults. These inconsistencies may be due to a number of factors includ ing the effect of gene gene interactions and the heterogeneous geneticbackground of samples used in studies and a relatively small number ofsamples used for study. We are carrying out an extensive study of geneticprediposition in MI using a relative isolated Newfoundland population which has a relatively homogeneous genetic background. The goal of thisstudy is to evaluate the possible roles of these three gene variants in thepathogenesis of MI and examine any potential interaction that may occurbetween them. As part of a pilot study we concurrently analyzed the preva lence of FXIII V34L FVL FII 20210A in approximately 221 patients withMI and 154 normal controls from the Newfoundland population. The detailsof the carrier frequency allele frequency of these three gene variants inboth MI patients and controls are summarized in Tab 1. The incidence ofFXIII 34L homozygotes in the MI patient group (5.4%) is lower than in nor mal controls (6.9%) but the difference is not statistically significant. Nohomogygotes for FVL or FII 20210A were found. Conclusions Theseresults clearly show the prevalence of the FII 20210A allele to be lower inthe Newfoundland population (0.6%) compared with that usually reported for the general Caucasian population (2%). Nevertheless the FII 20210Amutation is associated with an increased risk for MI in the Newfoundlandpopulation. Based on the limited number of samples analyzed so far ourresults have failed to support the FXIII 34L allele as a strong protective fac tor or FVL as a risk factor for MI.

1424,A locus for a cholesterol lowering gene (CLG) which lowers the cholesterol LDL and HDL levels was recently identified on chromosome 13q in a fam ily with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).( Am. J. Hum. Genet. 66 157 166 2000) Since Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is assembled from LDL andapolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) we here addressed the question whether theCLG affects also Lp(a) levels. Lp(a) concentration is extremely variable(>1000 fold differences among subject) and is controlled by a major gene the structural gene for apo(a). We have previously shown that in additionFH causing mutations in the LDL receptor gene have an influence on Lp(a)levels. We analysed Lp(a) levels and apo(a) phenotypes in the originalfamily (65 individuals) in which the CLG had been detected. Lp(a) concen trations were measured by ELISA and apo(a) isoforms were specified byimmunoblotting. In addition to the K IV polymorphism in the apo(a) geneand the FH genotype also the CLG had a significant independent effect onLp(a) levels. Employing ANOVA the K IV polymorphism explained 70% ofthe variation of Lp(a) levels and the LDL R and the CLG explained 17 3%and 6 6% of the residual variation respectively. Therefore we concludethat the cholesterol lowering gene affects also Lp(a) levels. ,2001
1425,Traditional linkage analyses lack power and precision when applied tocomplex traits such as cholesterol (chol) level. Association may be moresuccessful at identifying genes of small effect but are often controversialdue to problems such as population stratification (PS). We examined 8polymorphic sites previously shown to be associated with abnormal lipidand lipoprotein levels on the Kosrae Island where the population is anadmixture of native Kosraeans and Caucasian from late 19 thcentury. The 1102 individuals collected in this study aggregate along a main branch ofthe Kosraean pedigree. The traits studied included triglyceride (Tg) chol apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) apolipoprotein AII (apoAII) apolipoprotein B(apoB) body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) levels. The 8markers were common polymorphisms in following candidate genes apoAI CIII AIV gene cluster (apo CIII/SstI) apo AII (MspI) apo E (HhaI) cho lesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP/TaqIB) cholesterol 7? hydroxylase(CYP7/BsaI) hepatic lipase (HL/DraI) and microsomal triglyceride transferprotein (MTP/HhpI). The method we used was QTDT program by Abeca sis GR et al. When analyzed under a variance component model theapoCIII/SstI was associated with Tg (p=0.0031) and apoE/HhaI was asso ciated with apoB level (p=0.0004 0.0070 and 0.0285 for allele E4 E3 andE2). There was suggestive evidence for linkage of apoAII/MspI to systolicBP (p=0.0497) and the linkage evidence was accounted for by addingassociation to the model. Our study have the advantages of reducing like lihood of false positive result from PS and increasing the chance of dis covering relevant genetic factors due to a more homogenous environmen tal effect.

1426,Despite intensive studies of predisposition to thrombotic complications inpatients with varicose veins is disputed. We studied 158 patients with vari cose veins without history of venous thrombosis (VV) 111 patients withvein thrombosis (VT) 50 patients with varicose veins having complica tions of vein thrombosis (VV/VT) and 229 healthy controls. The C677TMTHFR gene the R506Q FV gene the C1565T GPIIIa gene were deter mined. The frequencies of the MTHFR gene TT genotype among patientswith VV VT VV and VT and control group were 5.7% 10% 16 % 8.4% respectively. This mutation is not independent risk factor for VT develop ment in Russians. However this genotype is a significant risk factor inpatients with both VV and VT { nan,2001
1427,It is well known that the frequency of thrombosis is increased in the tha lassemia syndromes. Moreover a higher thrombotic risk has beendescribed in patients with thalassemia intermedia expecially in untrans fused cases. The underlying hypercoagulable state has been attributed towidely variable hemostatic alterations including platelet hiperaggregability particularly post splenectomy and reduced levels of physiologic anticoag ulants such as antithrombin III (ATIII) protein C (PC) and protein S (PS)The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic background of thethrombotic thalassemic patients. We recruited 33 thalassemia majoraffected with thrombosis (venous and arterial) and a group of age and sexmatched non thrombotic thalassemia major patients and healthy controlsubjects. After informed consent a sample of 5 ml of blood was obtained. Molecular analysis of the factor V G1691A mutation (fV Leiden) the C677Tmutation in the MTHFR gene the prothrombin G20210A mutation in 3 untranslated region the hypervariable region 4 of intron 7 of the factor VIIgene and the glycoprotein IIIa gene polymorphism was performed bymeans of PCR restriction digestion and electrophoresis. Statistical analy sis was performed by contingency table analysis using Fisher s exact testor chi square test as appropriate. A p value of 0.0001 was obained by com paring allele frequencies of the fVII polymorphism in thrombotic and nonthrombotic thalassemia patients suggesting that the H7 allele is protectiveagainst thrombosis in Cooley patients. All other p values were > 0.05. Ourresults demonstrate that no one of the investigated factors seems to playa statistical significant role in the trombophilia status of thalassemicpatients with the exception of factor VII which appear involved in throm bophilia status. The possible pathogenesis of this finding could be repre sented by modifying factor VII blood levels associeted with different haplo types. ,2001
1428,Stroke and ischemic heart disease are the major causes of death and dis ability in industrial countries. Ischemic stroke is uncommon at young ageand large proportions of stroke are of undetermined etiology. We investi gated 111 relatively young individuals ( mean age 36.5 range 15 to 56years) with cerebral vascular disease (CVD) and 94 subjects of controlgroup was recruited from blood donors (mean age 41 range 24 to 60years). Factor V Leiden mutation 20210GA polymorphism in 3 untranslat ed region of the prothrombin gene G 455A in the ? fibrinogene gene the4G/5G PAI 1 promoter polymorphism C677T transition in the MTHFRgene PlA1A2 polymorphism in GP III gene were analyzed. 41 patients withCVD had antiphospholipid antibodies (APA) Ã¢\x80\x94 lupus anticoagulant or anti cardiolipin. A significant increase in the prevalence of the T677 allele of theMTHFR gene in patients with cerebral vascular disease carried antiphos pholipid antibodies compared with subjects without APA was found (allelefrequency 36% and 22% respectively p=0.02 OR=1.9 CI 95% 1.2 3.3). Asignificant increase in the prevalence of the 5G allele of the PAI 1 gene innon carried antiphospholipid antibodies CVD patients compared to con trols was also found ( allele frequency 46% and 39% respectively p=0.036 OR=1.8 CI 95% 1.3 2.6). Platelet activation was increased in carriers ofAPA compared with non carriers (p=0.01 OR=4.1 CI 95% 1.6 10.6) Noother differences between patients and controls were observed. ,2001
1429,Migraine is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Currently the number ofgenes involved in this common disorder and the mode of inheritance isunclear. However some insight has been gained from genetic studies intoa very rare and severe subtype of migraine known as familial hemiplegicmigraine (FHM). In this study we took a family based linkage and associ ation approach to investigate the FHM susceptibility region for involvementin typical migraine. Initial multipoint ALLEGRO analysis provided good evi dence for linkage of Chr1q31 markers to migraine in a large multigenera tional pedigree. The 1 LOD* unit support interval for suggestive linkagespanned ~18cM with a maximum allele sharing LOD* score of 2.04obtained for marker D1S249 P = 0.001. Subsequent analysis of an addi tional sample of 82 independent pedigrees added support to the initial find ings with a maximum LOD* of 1.07 (P = 0.013). Combining LOD* scoresacross families resulted in a maximum overall LOD* score of 3.11 at mark er D1S249 (P = 0.00007). Utilising the independent sample of 82 pedi grees we also performed a Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) usingthe TRANSMIT program. Results of this analysis indicated significant dis tortion of allele transmission at marker D1S205 (global X2(11) = 22.47 P= 0.021) located 8.2cM telomeric to D1S249. These positive linkage andassociation results will need further confirmation by independentresearchers but overall they provide good evidence for the existence of atypical migraine locus near these markers on Chr1q31 and support theidea of a common defective migraine gene within this genomic region. ,2001
1430,Migraine is a painful and debilitating neurovascular disorder affecting alarge proportion (~12%) of Caucasian adults. The disease is geneticallyheterogeneous and the number of involved genes is currently not known. Studies in our laboratory have utilised the complementary strategies offamily based linkage analysis and allelic association testing to localisegenes involved in migraine. We have incorporated techniques that employboth parametric and non parametric statistical measures. To date we havelocalised three migraine susceptibility loci. One large family displayed sig nificant excess allele sharing and cosegregation of chromosome 19p13markers thus localising a migraine susceptibility near the CACNA1A geneimplicated in familial hemiplegic migraine a rare and severe subtype ofmigraine. Further linkage analyses using families showing linkage to chro mosome 19 have localised a second major migraine gene locus to chro 370 Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritancemosome Xq. Here we report results of a recent fine mapping project that has refined this localisation to Xq24 28. As well we provide new evidenceimplicating a third migraine susceptibility region on chromosome 1q31 thatmay be partially interacting with the Xq region. Finally we will also be pre senting new genome scan data using a large independent sample of 92migraine affected families and some positive case control results from can didate gene studies. Overall our findings show that migraine is a polygenic disorder and suggest that defective genes on different chromosomes maybe interacting epistatically to influence this complex disorder. ,2001
1431,A recent study on 130 multiplex families with idiopathic generalized epilep sy provided evidence for susceptibility genes on chromosomes 2q36 3q26and 14q23. Prompted by this finding we sequenced a gene on chromo some 3q26 that encodes a regulatory beta subunit (KCNMB3) of a calci um activated potassium channel. We identified three variants in exon 3 ofthat gene N161S M226T and a single base deletion introducing a stopcodon which truncates the last 23 aminoacids delA807. We compared thedistribution of these polymorphisms between a group of 115 individualswith idiopathic epilepsy and a group of 165 controls. The N161S polymor phism was found on 8.3% of patients chromosomes (19/230) and on 4.9%of control chromosomes 16/330). delA807 was found on 10.9% (25/230) ofpatients and 8.5% (28/330) on control chromosomes. This difference isnon significant. However the distribution of genotypes in the patientsgroup was in departure from Hardy Winberg equilibrium (p< 0.005) and dif ferred significantly from the control group 10/115 epileptic patients werehomozygotes or compound heterozygotes for the polymorphisms (threeN161S/N161S one delA807/delA807 five N161S /delA807 oneM226T/delA807) compared to only 2/165 controls (one N161S/N161S andone N161S/delA807). These patients had generalized as well as partialepilepsy. We analyzed genetic association and linkage of these variants inepileptic families by the transmission disequilibrium test (Tdt). N161S anddelA807 were trasmitted significantly more often to affected offspringandthe wild type allele was trasmitted significantly more often to unaffect ed offspring (P=0.004). This analysis could not be carried out for M226Tbecause this variant was found in only one family. We genotyped 33 indi viduals in five families segregating both N161S and delA807. We detected14 homozygotes or compound heterozygotes 11 of which have epilepsy. Among the 19 remaining subjects 15 were heterozygotes (two affected)and four wild type homozygotes (none affected). KCNMB3 thoughexpressed at a low level in the brain may play a role in the regulation ofneuronal excitability. It accelerates the opening of a calcium activatedpotassium channel in response to an increase of intracellular calcium facil itating repolarization after sustained firing. If the variants we identifiedaffect its function KCNMB3 may be a suceptibility gene that contributes tothe multifactorial etiology underlying epilepsy. ,2001
1432,The CACNA1A gene encodes the main pore forming ?1A subunit of P/Q type voltage gated calcium channels. These channels are expressed in alarge variety of neurones where they have important roles in the control ofmembrane excitability neurotransmitter release and gene expression. Mutations in the mouse homologue of this gene are responsible for phe notypes mainly comprising absence type epileptic seizures and ataxia inthe models tottering and leaner. In humans mutations are involved in thepathogenesis of episodic ataxia 2 (EA 2) spinocerebellar ataxia type 6(SPA6) familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM). In a previous associationstudy for idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) we conducted withCACNA1A a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) present in exon 8 gave a significant result in a case control study. We confirmed this resultby HHRR and TDT which excluded possible population stratification arte facts. We have investigated this association further using 3 novel SNPsidentified by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC).These polymorphisms are in the introns adjacent to exon 8. Genotypingwas carried out in 230 IGE patients unselected for subtype and 238 con trols. All three SNPs gave significant p values by genotype and by allele(p=0.0003 p=0.0015 and p=0.0104 respectively). These results provideconfirmation of the initial result. To date none of the SNPs appear to befunctional and probably exert their effect by being in linkage disequilibriumwith a putative functional mutation. Future work will involve screeningCACNA1A for mutations at greater distances from exon 8 to define theregion of interest more precisely and to identify functionally significantSNPs which might identify the putative IGE susceptibility locus itself.

1433, tokyo.ac.jpNarcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent daytime sleepepisodes and cataplexy and also a multifactorial disorder involving genet ic and environmental factors. A genetic factor strongly associated with nar colepsy has been found in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class IIregion the HLA DRB1*1501 DQB1*0602 haplotype predisposes to the disorder. We have been searching for other genetic factors associated withthe disorder and our previous study where the tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF a) gene were investigated in narcoleptic patients and healthy con trols suggested that TNF a could be a new susceptibility gene for humannarcolepsy. In the present study we focused on the tumor necrosis factorreceptor 2 gene (TNFR2) and examined if there were any associations ofthe receptor with human narcolepsy. The TNFR2 gene is mapped on chro mosome 1p36 and possesses the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)that participates in an amino acid substitution at position 196 i.e. gener ates two alleles having methionine (196M) and arginine (196R). Using theSNP (196M/R) as a marker we investigated TNFR2 in narcoleptic patientsand healthy controls. Results indicate that the frequency of the TNFR2 196R allele in the patients was higher than that in the healthy controls. Wefurther examined the relationship of the TNFR2 and TNF a genes with thesusceptibility to human narcolepsy. Results suggested that the combina tion of TNFR2 196R and TNF a( 857T) could increase predisposition tothe disorder. Accordingly these observations suggest the possibility thatTNF a signal transduction system could participate in the pathogenesisand pathophysiology of human narcolepsy. Finally we add thatDRB1*1502 appears to have a negative association with narcolepsy lead ing to the possibility that the haplotype carrying DRB1*1502 confers pro tection against human narcolepsy. ,2001
1434,Animal studies have provided compelling evidence for a role for opioidreceptors in idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) and in particularabsence epilepsy. The WAG/Rij strain of rats exhibits both non convulsiveepileptic seizures similar to absences and a high density of mu opioidreceptors in the thalamic nuclei striatum and cortex. The mu opioid recep tor can decrease neuronal excitability by activating G protein coupledinwardly rectifying potassium channels. A number of polymorphisms inOPRM1 have been previously detected through mutation screening. An Ato G substitution at position 118 in exon 1 results in the replacement ofasparagine by aspartic acid (position 40). A recent study reported associ ation between the Asp40 allele and an idiopathic absence epilepsy samplecomprised of childhood and juvenile absence epilepsies (p=0.019). Weundertook this study in order to replicate these findings. Genotyping wasperformed on 218 probands and 200 controls for A118G and a less fre quent polymorphism C17T. Only A118G was found to be significant(p=0.00028). Within family studies were performed for 104 probands andboth parents. Both HHRR and ETDT analysis gave a significant differencebetween transmitted and untransmitted alleles (p=0.006 and p=0.0087respectively). Mutation screening by denaturing high performance liquidPosters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 371chromatography (dHPLC) has so far detected a number of mutations. These results confirm and improve upon the earlier findings. To date it isunclear how the Asp40 allele is involved in the generation of absenceseizures. We will be genotyping polymorphisms detected by dHPLC inexonic and intronic regions of OPRM1 soon. ,2001
1435,Idiopathic Parkinson s disease (PD) is an age dependent neurodegenera tive condition. Although it is predominantly a sporadic disease 20 25% ofcases are familial suggesting a complex mode of inheritance. a Synucleinand ubiquitin C terminal hydrolase genes have been implicated in a fewfamilies with autosomal dominant form of PD. In addition mutations inparkin gene have been identified as cause of autosomal recessive juvenileparkinsonism. Recently Lucking et al. (2000) reported that 49% of theirautosomal recessive PD families with early onset (7 to 58 years) hadparkin mutations. In the isolated PD group 77% of those with age of onsetless than 20 and 3% with age of onset less than 30 years had mutations inthe parkin gene. In order to determine the role of mutations in parkin genein our familial PD sample we screened a sample of 161 patients with apositive family history for PD and 108 matched normal controls with muta tions in exons 4 6 7 and 8. The PD sample was divided into two groupsbased on the age of onset of 40 years. None of the reported mutations inparkin gene was detected in our PD subgroups or normal controls. Weconcluded that parkin gene dose not play a role in the development of earlyonset familial PD in our sample. ,2001
1436, luebeck.deAutosomal recessive parkinsonism is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which is clinically similar to idiopathic ParkinsonÃÂ«s disease butassociated with additional neurological signs. We studied a large family(194 members) from South Tyrol (Northern Italy) with parkinsonism in threesuccessive generations (definitely affected n=13 possibly affected n=12)and other movement disorders such as isolated postural and kinetic upperlimb tremor (n=10) and restless legs syndrome (RLS n=14). In the pater nal branch parkinsonism in four affected siblings was shown to be due toa compound heterozygous mutation previously reported as DC1 (del Ex1 7) and DC2 (del1072) respectively while the origin of parkinsonism in thematernal branch was unknown. By haplotype analysis linkage to loci forparkinsonism on 4p 4q and 2p as well as to the GCH1 gene could beexcluded for both parkinsonism and RLS. However incompatibilities at themarkers D6S411 and D6S305 (located in intron 7 of parkin) suggestedhemizygosity and thus a partial deletion of one allele of parkin. By quanti tative PCR using the LightCycler (Roche) we identified a heterozygousdeletion of exon 7 and in additon redefined the DC1 mutation to be a dele tion of exon 7 only. For this analysis we developed a new method of quan titative duplex PCR involving PCR of all 12 exons of parkin and coamplifi cation of beta globin as internal standard. Taken together we present anew and accurate method to detect heterozygous exon deletions in parkin. Patients with parkinsonism should be tested for the presence of this kindof mutations. ,2001
1437,Background Ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease are disorders thataffect 1 million Americans and are collectively referred to as inflammatorybowel disease (IBD). In many patients it is difficult to distinguish which dis ease is present and both are associated with increased risk of cancer. Tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF beta)is involved in rapid host responseand has been linked to IBD. Therefore polymorphisms in this gene may beassociated with IBD or cancer. A Nco1 RFLP in intron 1 of the TNF betagene is such a site. The goal of this study was to determine whether geno type or allele frequencies reveal an association with colorectal cancer or IBD. Methods DNA from 124 IBD patients (68 Crohn s disease 56 ulcer ative colitis) 33 colon cancer patients and 77 controls were PCR amplifiedusing primers specific for the RFLP site in intron 1 of TNF beta. This gen erated a 782bp product which was digested with Nco1 and gel elec trophoresed. All patients were Caucasians from a predominantly ruralregion. Results. The digest produced two alleles and three genotypes. Sta tistical analysis of the allele and genotype frequencies revealed a differ ence in the TNFB1/B1 genotype frequency between cancer and controlpatient populations (p=0.034). There were no significant differencesbetween IBD patient groups and controls. Conclusions The TNF betaintron 1 polymorphism TNFB1/B1 genotype was more common in cancerpatients than in controls confirming results reported by Park et al (1998).It does not appear to be related to ulcerative colitis or Crohn s disease supporting Hampe et al (1999). ,2001
1438,Celiac disease(CD) is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of thesmall intestine. In fact in Sweden and probably in the entire western world it is the third most common chronic disorder among children. CD is asso ciated to HLA but is strongly influenced by genetic factors other than theHLA complex. We have performed a genome wide scan in CD. Based onthe relatively high risk of siblings to develop CD also in comparison withother autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders we believe thatgenome wide screening is a very promising way to find important genesthat predispose individuals to CD. We investigated familiar segregation at400 microsatellite markers in 108 well defined Swedish and Norwegianfamilies. We found several interesting regions. Strikingly our best resultscoincide with earlier findings in independent families! This gives strong evi dence that these regions are indeed true susceptibility regions in CD. ,2001
1439,Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of bronchial epithelium and sub mucosa and it is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting 2 4%of the population. It is a complex disease with multiple genetic and envi ronmental determinants. Several studies have shown linkage or associa tion of atopic asthma and IgE levels to the IL 4Ra gene in ethnicallydiverse populations but not in all populations. The aim of this study was todetermine the involvement of the IL 4Ra gene in the genetic determinationof asthma and/or the production of IgE in Sardinian population that is aisolated founder population. We studied the ILE50VAL variant and in addi tion we looked for and genotyped 3 highly polymorphic microsatellite mark ers of the IL 4Ra gene in a sample of 121 affected sib pairs belonging to110 families of Sardinian ancestry. All the subjects were phenotyped forasthma atopy and total serum IgE. We performed a linkage analysis byaffected sib pair method and an association study by the TDT (Transmis sion disequilibrium test) using Genehunter 2.0 program. Linkage analysisindicated no significant increase in allele sharing for asthma atopy or IgElevels. No allele transmission disequilibrium was observed and neither par ticular 3 point haplotype was associated with any phenotype. We concludefrom our data that IL 4Ra are unlikely to exert a major effect on the induc tion of the asthmatic phenotype in Sardinian population. ,2001
1440,Segregation analysis involves fitting a general model to the inheritancepattern of a trait. This method is used for parametric linkage analysis wherethe mode of inheritance must be specified exactly. Several non parametricmethods however have been proposed for linkage analysis of complextraits with unknown mode of inheritance and therefore comparison of para metric and nonparametric methods to search for candidate genes affectingasthma form the core of this study. Data on chromosome 5 from the Con sortium on Asthma Genetics (COAG) were studied. Various analyses ofindividuals affected with asthma were compared. This study is ideal forcomparison in that it has been previously analysed by COAG using non parametric alternatives. Three phenotypes were used a) affection dichoto my where both normal and affected sibs were included in the analysis b)analysis of affection status which was based on affected sibs only and c)analysis with severity and diathesis which were defined as a polychotomyor a quantitative trait within affected or normal individuals respectively. Single point analyses were performed using the COMDS program (com bined segregation and linkage analysis with diathesis and severity). A num ber of models were employed throughout the study but emphasis wasgiven to the additive single and two locus models. There is evidence tosuggest that certain classes of parametric models are useful for linkageanalysis of complex traits. ,2001
1441, erlangen.deRecently we identified a novel psoriasis susceptibility region on chromo some 19 by genome wide linkage analysis. To further evaluate the role ofthe susceptibility gene(s) in this region we performed linkage disequilibri um (LD) studies using densely spaced DNA markers. We recruited a com pletely new sample of 199 nuclear psoriasis families (trio design). 49 poly morphic microsatellite markers covering the region from marker D19S216 to D19S412 were genotyped. To test for allelic association we performedthe family based association test (FBAT) and the classical transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). Two regions of interest were identified. The firstregion comprises about 1.5 cM and is defined by the three closely linkedmarkers D19S928 (p=0.0269) D19S414 (p=0.0027) D19S871(p=0.0114) and by the adjacent D19S431 (p=0.0046). The second regionis defined by D19S922 (p=0.0260) by D19S391 (p=0.0027) and byD19S916 (p=0.0094) and extends about 4.8 cM. P values were correctedfor multiple testing. We conclude that this LD profile confirms the existenceof at least one psoriasis susceptibility locus in the newly defined region onchromosome 19. This locus maps between 51.7 cM and 53.2 cM frompTEL (nucleotide coordinates 36.9 Mb to 40.2 Mb). A second region ofinterest spanning from 26 cM to 30.8 cM also displays significant LD. Iden tification of this locus will require genotyping of more densely spaced mark ers iin order to further narrow this candidate gene region with positionalcloning methods. ,2001
1442,Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder affecting approximately 2% of the Cau casian population. Family clustering of the disease is well established andnon parametric linkage analyses have mapped disease susceptibility locion chromosomes 6p (PSORS1) and 17q (PSORS2). Non confirmed evi dence for linkage is also available for chromosomes 2q 3q 4q (PSORS3) 8q 16q and 20p. We mapped an additional susceptibility locus on chro mosome 1q21 (PSORS4). In this study we have carried out a linkage dis equilibrium analysis in order to achieve a finer localization. We recruited79 triads from continental Italy and typed them at five loci spanning the 1.6Mb region generating the highest multipoint LOD scores in our previouslinkage study. We observed significant evidence for association withD1S2346 marker (p = 0.004). Results consistent with this data wereobtained by typing an independent sample that included 28 patients and56 controls originating from Sardinia. In fact p values of 0.02 wereobserved with both D1S2346 and D1S2715 markers. We sought furtherconfirmation of our results by typing both samples with two novel markers(140J1C and 140J1D) flanking D1S2346. Marker 140J1D generated a pvalue of 0.003 in the continental Italy sample where a D1S2346/140J1Dhaplotype was found with a higher frequency among patients chromo somes. Altogether our data indicate that the 1q21 susceptibility gene maybe localized in the genomic interval spanned by D1S2346 and 140J1D. This is the first evidence supporting the refinement of a non HLA psoriasissusceptibility locus. ,2001
1443,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disorder of thenervous system. Its onset is usually in young adulthood and it affectsmainly Caucasians of North European origin. Previous studies have iden tified a number of suggestive linkages with association between MS andhuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms on chromosome 6p21 thus far the only consistently replicated finding. Genetically isolated popu lations such as Finland Iceland and Sardinia offer attractive environmentsfor the study of complex diseases. There is good evidence to suggest thatthe Tasmanian population is also a genetic isolate which is more homo geneous than mainland Australia. A haplotype based case control strategyhas been developed to search genome wide for shared MS susceptibilitygenes in people of Tasmanian ancestry. Our recruitment strategy hasfocussed on identifying individuals (cases and controls) who are descen dants of the initial settlers from the early to mid 1800 s. To date we havecollected samples for 180 MS patients 100 controls and a close constel Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 373lation of relatives for both. Theoretically the expected size of a shared seg ment between two people in such a young population is 25 centimorgans(cM) with a standard deviation of 18 cM. Therefore we are performing agenome wide search at a resolution of 5 cM to detect shared chromoso mal regions inherited identical by descent in distantly related MS patientsusing 811 genetic markers from the ABI PRISMÃ¢\x80\x9c HD 5 set. In addition we are attempting to replicate findings for some regions of suggestive linkageidentified previously using more densely spaced markers. ,2001
1444,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be an autoimmune process occurringin genetically susceptible individuals after an appropriate environmentalexposure. We have exploited the homogeneous Afrikaner population ofEuropean ancestry to investigate the likelihood that iron dysregulation inassociation with infectious and/or autoimmune disease susceptibility mayunderlie the MS phenotype in a subgroup of patients. The functional Z DNA forming repeat polymorphism of the natural resistance associatedmacrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) gene was analyzed in 104 patients diag nosed with MS and 522 Caucasian controls. A family based control groupconsisting of 32 parental alleles not transmitted to MS offspring was addi tionally studied to exclude the likelihood of population substructures. Sta tistically significant differences in allelic distribution were observedbetween the patient and control samples drawn from the same population(P<0.01). Evidence is furthermore provided that alleles considered to bedetrimental in relation to autoimmune disease susceptibility may be main tained in the population as a consequence of improved survival to repro ductive age following infectious disease challenge. Although it remains tobe determined whether the disease phenotype in MS patients with allele 5of the NRAMP1 promoter polymorphism is directly related to dysregulationof iron or modified susceptibility to viral infection and/or autoimmunity acombination of these processes most likely underlie the disease pheno type in these patients. In view of the emerging role of polymorphic variantsin complex diseases and minimizing of possible confounding factors in thisassociation study we conclude that allelic variation in the NRAMP1 pro moter may contribute significantly to MS susceptibility in the South AfricanCaucasian population. ,2001
1445,Spontaneous myelination defective mutants may help identify individualgenes involved in myelination or disorders affecting myelin. The autosomalrecessive hsh mouse displays hindquarter and tail tremors during the peri od of maximum CNS myelination (P5 P20) that largely disappear in theadult. Ultrastructural examination showed hypo myelination that was mostpronounced in the spinal cord and brain stem . This has implications for theregional control of myelination by local oligodendrocytes by comparisonwith their brain hemisphere counterparts. Initial experiments identified thechromosomes which harbour the hsh gene and a major modifying locus. Fine mapping originally placed the hsh mutation at an interval of 2.8cM. Recent experiments have reduced this interval to 1.2cm with the mutationpositioned up stream of a calcium binding protein gene cluster. At least twogenes present within this family are up regulated at the mRNA transcrip tion level when the hsh phenotype is most strongly expressed (P20) whichmay suggest that the hsh gene is involved in their regulation. Currentexperiments are aimed at generating novel polymorphic markers within thearea of interest in order to identify putative candidate genes. ,2001
1446,Multiple and different genetic defects may be associated with the develop ment of non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Friedreich sataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessively inherited neurologic disease asso ciated with a high prevalence of diabetes. This disease is caused by thedecreased expression of a mitochondrial protein frataxin encoded by theX25 gene. A variable expansion of a GAA repeats is present in the fistintron of the X25 gene. Long repeats (> 66 repeats) are present in patientswith Friedreich s ataxia while a shot repeats may be associated withNIDDM. Using a polymerase chain reaction based assay We evaluatedexpansions of the triplet repeat in the X25 gene in two populations controlrandom group and NIDDM patients group from Russia. We found 11 allel ic variants with a variable number GAA repeats ( from 1 to 15 repeats). Suf ficient differences in distribution of alleles between control population andpatients were observed (X2=37 14 p<0 0001). A frequency allele con tained 4 GAA repeats especially was distinguished between control sub jects (69%) and patients (44%). We conclude that the X25/frataxine GAApolymorphism probably is associated with the pathogenesis of NIDDM inRussia. ,2001
1447,Recurrence risk was investigated for 578 sibling pairs derived from multi plex IDDM families (Field et al. 1996) using a pattern recognition approachcalled grade of membership analysis. The genetic information used to con struct model based groups included 1) the number of alleles shared IBDwithin sib pairs for each of 8 markers spanning the IDDM11 locus on chro mosome 14 2) IBD sharing for the HLA DQ locus and 3) the specificshared HLA DQ alleles. Sex and disease status for the pair (AA bothaffected AU discordant) were also input into the model. Six latent groupsbest represented the data. Each variable was highly informative. Thegroups had distinct profiles of model based frequencies for the input vari ables. Group 1 male AA pairs no IDDM11 region sharing both HLA DQ alleles shared IBD (usually 4 4 3 3 or 1 3) and 18% prevalence. Group2 no recurrence risk or sharing for either loci. Groups 3 and 4 exactly oneIDDM11 region allele shared from the mother or father respectively recur rence risks of 34% and 50% and similar prevalences of 20%. Group 5 female AA pairs most of whom shared the high risk HLA DQ 3 4 haplotype(6% prevalence). Group 6 complete IDDM11 region IBD sharing and 80%recurrence (26% prevalence). Seventy six pairs (13%) belonged entirely toa single group. The remainder divided membership. We conclude that thedistinct genetic patterns for the IDDM11 and HLA DQ loci predict recur rence risk for IDDM in multiplex families. ,2001
1448,Leptin the protein product of the obesity(OB) gene is produced by the adi pose tissues and plays an important role in regulation of body weight and374 Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritanceenergy expenditure through CNS feedback mechanisms. Levels of leptin are elevated in patients with obesity and this is believed to result from lep tin resistance. We conducted a Nation wide study to determine the preva lence of obesity in Saudi Arabia and screened 14805 adult males andfemale Saudis. Using Body Mass Index (BMI) values the individuals wereclassified as overweight( BMI 25 29.9) obese (BMI >30) and normal (BMI<25). The overall prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Saudi maleswas 27.23% and 13.0% and in Saudi females was 25.20% and 20.3% respectively. We then conducted a study of serum leptin level plasmalipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and glucose on randomly selected 173individuals. 75 of these were obese 49 were overweight and the rest werenormal weight individuals. Serum leptin was estimated by RIA and theother parameters on autoanalyser. The serum leptin was significantly high er in the obese group compared to the non obese both in the males andfemales(p<.001). A significant correlation was obtained with BMI. Howeverno correlation could be established with age plasma cholesterol triglyc erides and blood glucose. This paper will present a comprehensive cover age of leptin functions its genetics and its role in obesity in Saudis. ,2001
1449,Obesity is a highly prevalent multigenic trait that predicts increased mor bidity and mortality and contributes to many health problems in the West ern society. We have identified a family in which a balanced reciprocal translocationbetween chromosome 4 and 15 is associated with severe obesity. Chro mosome analysis revealed the translocation in the mother and her two chil dren. Clinical evaluation and investigation of family members revealed abody mass index (BMI) of >= 45 kg/m 2 but no other pathological features in individuals carrying the translocation. Metabolic and dietary factorsbehind the increased BMI were excluded. We suggest that the phenotype in this family is caused by a disruption of afunctional gene or a positional effect at one of the two breakpoints. Thereare no identified genes corresponding to obesity close to the translocationbreakpoints at chromosome 4 or 15 in our family. The Prader Willi regionis located on chromosome 15 but not close to the breakpoint. To further map the translocation breakpoints we are in using fluorescencein situ hybridisation (FISH) to metaphase chromosomes from affected fam ily members. ,2001
1450,PCOS is a common cause of infertility in reproductive age women and ischaracterized by hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. One promis ing candidate region for PCOS identified by a candidate gene screen is theinsulin receptor gene (INSR) region on Chr19p13. This region has evi dence for both linkage and association with PCOS. The strongest evidencefor linkage with PCOS in 95 affected sister pairs was with short tandemrepeat polymorphism D19S884 (IBD = 0.62 Chi Square = 7.04). Thestrongest evidence for association with PCOS as measured by the trans mission disequilibrium test (TDT) in a sample of 347 parent affected off spring trios was observed with allele 8 of D19S884 (Chi Square = 14.58)and allele 12 of D19S922 (Chi Square = 10.38). D19S884 and D19S922are separated by 13 kb and both markers are located approximately 1 Mbcentromeric to INSR. Association in the presence of linkage as determinedby the TDT is dependent on the presence of disequilibrium between thephenotype and marker allele tested and disequilibrium generally is notmaintained over such extensive regions in outbred populations. It is there fore unlikely that the observed association is due to a variant at the INSRgene itself. More likely the association is due to a variant in an unidentifiedgene or a very distal regulatory element of INSR. Six known genes and 12unnamed mRNAs or ESTs have been mapped within 250 kb of D19S884and D19S922. We are currently evaluating these genes and ESTs as can didate genes for PCOS. ,2001
1451,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affect ing up to 10% of women of a reproductive age characterised by polycysticovaries hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation. Consequently it is amajor cause of infertility. The heterogeneity of symptoms presented hascontributed to an elusive genetic aetiology. We performed a case controlstudy showing that the AA genotype of the G2039A FSHR gene polymor phism confers a reduced risk of PCOS (OR = 0.04 P < 0.05) in the controlpopulation (n=75) in comparison to PCOS women (n=29). This concurswith a recent study suggesting that women with the 2039G FSHR allelerequire higher ampoules of FSH during ovarian stimulation therapy withcomparison to those with the 2039A FSHR allele. We are currently per forming expression studies of each of the FSHR alleles (2039A & 2039G)in COS 7 cells in order to identify functional effects of the polymorphiclocus on ligand binding receptor mediated second messenger signalling. The identification of genes involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS willassist in the accurate diagnosis of this disorder and improve clinical man agement of these patients with particular significance in fertility treatment. ,2001
1452,The autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) including Graves disease (GD)and Hashimoto s thyroiditis (HT) are inherited as complex traits. We initiat ed a whole genome linkage study of patients with AITDs in order to iden tify the susceptibility genes involved in their pathogenesis. We have stud ied 39 patients affected with GD or HT and 68 related controls whobelonged to a large consanguinous family composed of more than 200members. Linkage analysis was performed using the lod score methodunder two arbitrary models dominant and recessive ones. A positive lodscore was found for D2S171 assuming a recessive mode of inheritanceand 50% penetrance which suggests the presence of a major AITDs sus ceptibility gene on chromosome 2p21. The examination of genes mappedto this region showed that the hFKBP 12 gene which modulates theimmune system was mapped near D2S171 and could be therefore a can didate gene in AITDs pathogenesis. Genetic and functional studies of thehFKBP 12 gene in AITDs patients are being accomplished. ,2001
1453,We investigated the role of CTLA 4 gene in the autoimmune thyroid dis eases (AITDs) development. We used three polymorphic microsatellitesD2S311 D2S143 and the intronic CTLA 4 (AT)n marker to look for linkageand two CTLA 4 dimorphisms located in the promotor region at position 318 (C/T) and in exon 1 (49 A/G) to test an association. Forty two patientsand fifty one related controls who belong to a large Tunisian family wereinvestigated. We obtained no significant lod scores for each microsatelliteassuming either dominant or recessive mode of inheritance. Looking for agenetic association the allelic genotypic and phenotypic frequencies cor responding to the CTLA 4 49 (A/G) position were compared. No significantdifferences between patients and controls were found. In addition theCTLA 4 alleles transmission showed no statistical deviation from theexpected 50% distribution. Therefore CTLA 4 was neither a major nor aminor contributing gene to AITDs susceptibility. ,2001
1454,Graves disease (GD) is organ specific autoimmune disorder of multifacto rial aetiology with a polygenic mode of inheritance. A recent report hasdemonstrated a linkage and an association between a genetic markers ofCTLA 4 gene on chromosome 2q33 and GD. To confirm this association inPosters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 375Tunisian population three polymorphisms of CTLA 4 gene were analysed one at 318 position from the ATG start codon consisting of a C/T change a second in position 49 of the exon 1 which lies in a A/G transition andthird in the 3 untranslated region with variant lenghts of dinucleotide (AT)nrepeat. The genomic DNA from 87 patients with GD and 205 healthy indi viduals were genotyped after specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)amplification. Comparative analysis using chi(2) test showed significant dif ferences in allele and genotype frequencies of A/G dimorphic markerbetween patients and controls. A significant increase of A/A homozygousindividuals among patients (25.3% vs 12.7% p=0.007 OR=2.33) wasfound.

1455,Familial clustering of diabetic nephropathy (DN) suggests the existence ofsusceptibility genes that contribute to the development of kidney diseasein diabetic patients. In order to identify these genes we have analyzed 70candidate genes for linkage and association with DN. Families were ascer tained through a proband with diabetes and ESRD. DN in diabetic sibs ofthe proband was defined by elevated albumin (ACR >300 ug/mg) in two ofthree urine samples. Diabetic sibs were considered unaffected for DN ifthey had normoalbuminuria (ACR<30 ug/mg) duration of diabetes >15years and were not taking ACE inhibitor medications. Microsatellites <1cMfrom each candidate gene were genotyped in 32 parent child trios and 47multiplex families. Nominally significant TDT results were obtained at sev eral genes (e.g. lamiminC1 and integrinA2). We focus here on the findingswith two microsatellites in the region of the angiotensin receptor 1 gene(AGTR1 chromosome 3q) where Moczulski et al (Diabetes 47 1164 1998) found evidence for linkage with DN in discordant sibs (DSPs) but notfrom TDT. Although we found no evidence for linkage in DSPs there wasan elevated TDT at D3S1308 (allele 7 64% of 44 transmissions chi square=3.3) and ATCA (allele 6 72% of 18 transmissions chi square=3.6).When these results are combined with transmissions to unaffected off spring (diabetic but non DN) the results for D3S1308 become more strik ing allele 7 was transmitted to only 7 of 23 non DN offspring resulting ina contingency chi squared of 6.7. In view of the small sample size theseresults must be considered preliminary results from additional families willbe presented. ,2001
1456,A variable number tandem 27 bp repeat in intron 4 of the endothelial nitricoxide synthase (ecNOS) gene has been found to affect the plasma levelsof NO metabolites. Two alleles are of varied frequencies in different popu lations (a and b). The shorter allele a has been associated in Japanesepopulations with the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease and progres sion of renal failure. The progression of renal failue was tested in patientswith ESRD of various etiologies or in patients with various nephropathies excluding diabetic nephropathy. Here we tested the putative association ofthis polymorhism in a Cypriot population of patients with ESRD by study ing the genotypes in 70 ESRD patients and 92 non renal patients orhealthy subjects. The two alleles were of similar frequencies in the twopopulations 0.15 and 0.85 for alleles a and b respectively. The frequenciesof aa ab and bb genotypes were 0% (0/92) 33.7% (31/92) 66.3% (61/92)in the control group and 8.6% (6/70) 15.7% (11/70) 75.7% (53/70) in thepatient group. The data between patients and controls were analysed bychi square test and showed that the frequency of ecNOS4 aa genotype inthe patient population was significantly higher than that in the control group(P<0.005). Our work perhaps represents the first study supporting theassociation of ecNOS gene polymorphism with ESRD in a Caucasian pop ulation. Not surprisingly the frequency of allele a is somewhat increased(15%) compared to Japanese populations reported (~10%). Also of inter est is the finding that in our study population the aa genotype is a predis posing factor to ESRD progression regardless of etiology not excluding diabetics. ,2001
1457,Osteoporosis (OP) is a common condition characterized by reduced skele tal strength and increased susceptibility to fracture. It is estimated that 10million people are affected with OP in the USA alone and each year morethan 1.5 million people worldwide suffer from fractures of the hip the mostdebilitating consequence of OP. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is thesingle most important risk factor for OP. The risk of fracture approximatelydoubles with each 1 SD below the normal ( young adult ) BMD. The impor tance of genetic factors in variability in BMD is suggested by several epi demiological studies showing increased concordance in monozygotic vs.dizygotic twins increased risk of low BMD with parental history of lowBMD and the results of segregation analysis consistent with major geneinfluences on BMD and other related traits. Our initial genome screen inseven large Canadian pedigrees suggested a candidate region for BMD in1p36 with a peak multipoint lod score for hip BMD of 2.29 near markerD1S450 obtained with the Haseman Elston test. In order to verify this find ing we typed the same families and an additional sample of 42 Canadiannuclear families for 9 markers spanning ~30 cM around D1S450. Variancecomponent analysis using the Genehunter program gave a maximum mul tipoint lod score of 1.2 for the old families of 1.1 for the new families andof 2.1 for all families combined for hip BMD. These results seem to confirmthat a locus for BMD may be located in this region of chromosome 1. ,2001
1458,In an effort to identify genes involved in bone mineral density determina tion the 800 bp region of the human COL1A1 promoter containing cis ele ments important for in vivo osteoblast expression was screened searchingfor new allelic variants. Two new SNPs (PCOL1 and PCOL2) were found. PCOL1was in strong linkage disequilibrium with the previously describedSp1 polimorphysm of intron 1 whereas PCOL2 showed association toBMD (P< 0.05) in a cohort of 256 postmenopausal women. Electrophoret ic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed using single or double stranded oligonucleotides containing the PCOL1 or the PCOL2 sites andshowed in both cases a specific binding to osteoblast nuclear proteins. PCOL1 is a deletion of a T in a tract of eight T residues. In the EMSAresults the binding seems to specifically involve the T bearing strand. Thisresult suggests that poly pyrimidine single strand DNA binding proteinsare involved. Several studies show the capacity of these sequences toadopt alternative DNA conformations. EMSAs perfomed using severalcompetitions of double and singleÃ¢\x80\x94stranded oligonucleotides seem toagree with this possibility. PCOL2 is a G to T transversion that lies withinputative and overlapped GKLF and Sp1 binding sites. When comparing thetwo alleles the affinity of the binding is stronger for the G allele. This mightresult in a different rate of gene transcription. Interestingly the oligonu cleotide bearing the consensus Sp1 binding site is able to compete in theEMSA analyses. This result suggests that either Sp1 or a related factor isinvolved in the binding to nan,2001
1459, marburg.deLittle is known about the identity of genetic factors involved in the complexaetiology of non syndromic neural tube defects (NTDs). Reasonablehuman NTD candidate genes are the human homologs of mice exen cephaly genes and other vertebrate genes for which a functional role inneural tube closure is well established. TFAP2a MSX2 and SLUG areexpressed in the dorsal part of the developing neural tube and were there fore tested as candidates contributing to the aetiology of human NTD. The376 Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritancecoding sequence of the three genes was screened for mutations in 200 NTD patients using single strand conformational analysis (SSCA). Weidentified sequence variants in all three genes Two TFAP2a point muta tions in individual patients were silent on amino acid level (C308C T396T).On nucleic acid level these mutations change evolutionary conservedcodons and thus may influence mRNA processing and translation efficien cy. One NTD patient displayed an exonic 9 bp deletion in MSX2 leading toa shortened and possibly less functional protein. In yet another patient amissense mutation (D119E) was found in the Slug subfamily definingregion preceding the first zinc finger. Seven polymorphisms detected inTFAP2a and MSX2 were equally distributed in patients and controls. Patients with combined heterozygosity of a MSX2 and a TFAP2a polymor phism were at a slightly increased risk for NTD (OR 1.71 95% CI 0.57 5.39). The present study defines new genetic variants which may act inconcert with other yet unidentified factors to increase susceptibility tohuman NTD. Further association and functional studies are necessary tosupport these observations. ,2001
1460,Loci on chromosome 17 (including RARA) have shown allelic associationwith non syndromic oral clefts in Caucasian populations although neverinvestigated in Asian populations. Furthermore there is a major oral cleftgene on murine chromosome 11 homologous to human chromosome 17.17 markers spanning chromosome 17 (10cM apart including RARA) wereassessed in 36 multiplex families from Shanghai China. LOD scores (sin gle point and multipoint) model free linkage analyses (SimIBD) and allel ic association tests (TDT Fisher s exact test and Chi square tests) wereperformed on the total sample plus families whose probands had eithercleft lip and cleft palate (CLP subgroup n=23) or cleft lip only (CL sub group n=13). LOD scores from single point analyses were inconclusive multipoint LOD scores rejected linkage except for a few regions in the CLsubgroup. However positive results were found for the RARA region andnearby loci using the model free methods with variable results for the CLand CLP subgroups. Therefore genetic variation within or near RARAappears to be involved in cleft formation in this population. Furthermore based on the differing pattern of results in the CL versus CLP subgroups it appears that the formation of CL and CLP is either due to differing alle les at the same genetic locus or to different but related (and/or linked)genes that modify the severity and expression of oral clefting. ,2001
1461, aachen.deInsulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and the growth factor bound protein 2 (GRB2) play an important role in the IGF and insulin signal tranductionpathway by being the major substrates of IGF1 receptor tyrosine kinases. Several members of the IGF pathway have been proposed as candidatesfor growth retardation particularly in Silver Russell syndrome (SRS). Dueto their role in intracellular IGF signalling and their genomic localisation(2q36 and 17q24 25) we searched for genetic variations in IRS1 andGRB2. Loss of function of these proteins might contribute to the clinicalfeature of growth retardation. Aberrations in the regions on chromosomes2 and 17 have been described to be involved in growth restriction. Ourscreening approach included 17 patients with idiopathic pre and postnatalgrowth retardation and 10 SRS patients. Applying single strand conforma tion polymorphism analysis restriction assays and sequencing we foundtwo amino acid substitutions (D90E and G971R) and two silent variants(c1722G>A and c3432G>A) in nan,2001
1462,Hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is in most cases genetically deter mined disease with high level of allele and locus heterogeneity. There areseveral candidate genes for HCM. The most often mutated one is the betamyosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) which is responsible for about half ofgenetic cases. To study causes of HCM in Russian population we havecollected the sample of patients with idiopathic HCM. Searching for func tional mutations and SNPs in this gene was performed by means of auto mated sequencing with dye terminator chemistry. Exons 3 24 of the genewere screened which frequently mutate in HCM. Some presumable mod ifying loci also were investigated (i.e. NOS3 ACE mtDNA). We havefound several MYH7 sequence alterations (SNPs) in the affected sample. Although representing common polymorphisms some of them may be rel evant to the disease. SNPs may be in linkage disequilibrium with unidenti fied mutations that contribute to the HCM phenotype. We have found thatnovel silent substitution in exon 24 (T15753C with frequency of rare alleleC 27% in affected sample) is associated with the extent of cardiac hyper throphy. Left ventricular mass index mean value was 161.75 in the groupof carriers of rare allele whereas it was 229.44 in the group of non carri ers (F=6.73 P=0.0212). Our findings confirm high genetic heterogeneity ofHCM. Association of silent SNP with extent of hyperthrophy suggests pres ence of other mutations which are in linkage disequilibrium with this SNPand which may be either causal for HCM or having modifying effect on thephenotype. ,2001
1463,The active form of vitamin D has been shown to induce apoptosis andinhibit breast cancer cell growth mediated by the vitamin D receptor(VDR). Although at least three groups have studied VDR polymorphisms inbreast cancer we are not aware of any published study of interactions. Wedescribe a pilot case control study. Sixty five breast cancer cases wererecruited through the breast service at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary Scotland.58 female controls were selected at random from local general practition er registers. Subjects completed a food frequency questionnaire and pro vided a DNA sample (Fok1 and Bsm1 VDR polymorphisms). Women in thehighest tertile of vitamin D intake were at two fold raised risk of breast can cer compared to the lowest tertile (OR=2.18 95% CI 0.88 5.39) but thisdid not reach statistical significance. No association was found betweenbreast cancer risk and the BsmI polymorphism. There was a trend ofPosters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 377reducing risk with increasing number of FokI variant alleles compared to homozygous wild type heterozygous women had an almost 30% reducedrisk (OR=0.72 95% CI 0.30 1.70) and homozygous mutants a 60% lowerrisk (OR=0.40 95% CI 0.08 1.95). To investigate interactions subjectswere stratified by presence or absence of the FokI variant allele and oddsratios for vitamin D intake computed within each strata. Compared withlowest vitamin D intake levels higher intake was associated with increasedrisk in both strata among women FokI homozygous wild type OR high vslow=1.90 (0.32 11.31) among Fok1 heterozygotes OR high vs low=1.50(0.32 11.31). This finding requires confirmation in other studies. ,2001
1464,Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms had been proven to havean influence on mineral metabolism and on the course of cancers andinfections. This study is a four year survival analysis of 143 hemodialysis(HD) patients who were genotyped for polymorphisms located at the 5 and3 regions of the VDR gene. The Chi square test was applied to comparegenotype distribution among survivors and non survivors. Survival wasanalysed with Kaplan Meier according to Bsm I genotypes. Cox regressionanalysis was performed including as variables the 5 polymorphic locusFok I and the two 3 polymorphic loci Bsm I and PolyA adjusting for age time on HD hours of HD per week serum calcium phosphorus albuminand iPTH presence of diabetes mellitus ischemic heart disease and cal citriol treatment. Bsm I and PolyA polymorphisms were in strong linkagedisequilibrium. The bb genotype was over represented among survivors(bb 38/83 45.7%) compared to non survivors (bb 13/60 21.6%). Coxanalysis showed a significant influence of Bsm I polymorphism (but norFok I nor Poly A) age calcitriol treatment and diabetes mellitus on mor tality. The BB and Bb genotypes were independent predictor of mortality(Hazard Ratios [HR] 3.7 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.7 8 and 2.75 95%CI 1.4 5.4 respectively). Survival means by Kaplan Meier analysiswere 983 days (95%CI 785 1181) for BB 1152 days (95%CI 1030 1274)for Bb and 1290 days (95%CI 1183 1396) for bb log rank p=0.01. Simi lar results were obtained when the analysis was performed to the patientswho had been on hemodialysis for less than 5 years (n=94) indicating thatthe genotype influence survival rate irrespective of the duration ofhemodialysis previously to enrolment. In conclusion this study shows thatBsm I polymorphism of the VDR gene is an independent predictor of mor tality in hemodialysis patients. ,2001
1465,Polymorphisms at the glutathione S transferase M1 (GSTM1) gene locushave attracted much interest because the homozygous GSTM1 deletion(GSTM1 0/0) seems to modify the risk for different types of cancer allergyand other diseases. The iron deficiency anemia is one of the widespread diseases on a Globe 700 800 million persons suffer iron anemia or latentdeficit Ferri lactas. This disease most frequently meets for children ado lescents and women. Iron anemia is complex disease caused by a combi nation of both genetic and environmental influences. Polymorphism at theGSTM1 gene locus in 93 patients with iron anemia from Bashkortostan andin 90 healthy individuals from control group was studied by PCR method. The frequencies of the GSTM0/0 genotypes were 0 40 in patients with ironanemia and 0 54 in control group. The data of this study demonstrate thatthe differences in distribution of GSTM1 allele frequencies betweenpatients with iron anemia and control individuals were not significantly(p=0 05). Our findings indicate that the GSTM10/0 genotype was not linkedwith iron anemia in Bashkortostan. ,2001
1466, tokyo.ac.jpIL 4 is one of important anti inflammatory cytokines. The 590C/T poly morphism in the promoter of the IL 4 has been reported to be associatedwith asthma and atopy. Although an exact role of the 590C/T polymor phism in the pathogenesis of these diseases is still unclear this variationmay affect the expression of the IL 4. Recently the serum level of IL 4 wasfound to be inversely correlated with development of severe malarialanaemia in Zambia. Thus we examined a possible association of the 590C/T polymorphism with malaria severity in 219 mild malaria 164 non cerebral severe malaria and 110 cerebral malaria patients living in thenorthwest of Thailand. The genotyping was performed by PCR SSCPmethod. Our result showed no significant difference in the frequency of the 590C/T polymorphism among three groups. Interestingly in this popula tion the frequency of 590T allele was higher than that of 590C allele. Fur ther variation analysis of other cytokine genes IL 6 IL 10 and IL 13 iscurrently underway for our patient samples. ,2001
1467,"The D32 insertion deletion polymorphism of the CCR5 chemokine recep tor gene and the Bsm I RFLP of the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene hasbeen studied in relation to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1)infection and disease progression in a cohort of seropositive intravenousdrug users (HIV+/IVDU). No HIV+/IVDU patients homozygous for D32allele were detected indicating that those individuals are strongly protect ed against HIV 1 infection. CCR5 wtD32 heterozygotes were not associat ed with slow progression to AIDS or CD4 cell count <200 cell/ L. In con trast a bad progression of the disease was associated with VDR BB geno type. A higher proportion of this genotype was found in patients with CD4cell count <200 cells/ L (p=0.007). In addition VDR BB patients show a faster progression to both AIDS CDC 1993 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7 95%confidence interval [CI] 1.02 2.8) and CD4 cell count <200 cell/ L (HR 2.1 95%CI 1.2 3.5). When the analysis was restricted to those patientswith a VDR bb genetic background CCR5 wtD32 heterozygosity confersprotection to disease progression. CCR5 wtD32 heterozygotes were over represented in both CDC 1993 non progressors (odds ratio [OR] 0.28 95%CI 0.08 0.96) and those with CD4 cell count >200 cells/ L (OR 0.26 95%CI 0.06 1.15). In addition CCR5 wtD32 heterozygotes show a slowprogression to AIDS CDC 1993 (HR 0.29 95%CI 0.08 0.97). Furtherstudies will be required to clarify the role of VDR polymorphisms in HIV 1pathogenesis and their co operative interaction with chemokine receptorpolymorphisms so far involved in HIV 1 disease progression. The confir mation that certain VDR genotypes confers a bad progression of the dis ease and that other genotypes allow CCR5 wtD32 heterozygotes to man ifest a delayed progression of the disease will offer new opportunities forthe rational design of therapeutic interventions.378 Posters: Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex InheritanceP1417.

G6PD linked genes have been implicated in thisage related skewing of X inactivation in Safari cats. In a study of X inacti vation in 71 elderly monozygotic twin pairs we found a strong tendency forthe same cell line of blood cells to be the predominant cell line in twin pairs. In the present work we tested the possibility that age related skewing of Xinactivation is related to a locus linked to the G6PD gene in humans. Weanalyzed X inactivation in 101 dizygotic twin pairs aged 73 93 years. TheX inactivation pattern was classified as skewed when 80% or more of thecells had the same X chromosome active. The frequency of skewed X inac tivation in the twins (37%) was increased compared to blood donors aged19 65 years (7%). The correlation coefficient for the X inactivation patternwas 0.23 (P=0.02) for the dizygotic twin pairs and 0.52 (P<0.01) for themonozygotic twin pairs confirming a genetic influence on X inactivationphenotype in elderly females. Analysis of markers in the G6PD region (F8Cand DXS15) showed a significant tendency for twins who had inherited dif ferent maternal alleles in these markers to be discordant for X inactivationphenotype (one twin having a skewed and the other twin having a non skewed pattern). We conclude that skewing of X inactivation in elderlyfemales may be influenced by a locus linked to the G6PD region mostprobably through a selection mechanism. ",2001
1468,The completed sequence of the human genome provides the startingmaterial for genome wide discovery of DNA sequence variants among indi viduals in human populations and their correlation with drug response tox icity and disease predisposition. Pharmacogenetic correlation studies areexpected to be valuable in target discovery and validation in preclinicaland clinical phases of drug development and for designing the post mar keting genetic diagnostic tests for individualizing drug dosing in the future. Such studies require a range of technical capabilities both in sample geno typing and data handling along with access to phenotypically well definedclinical populations exhibiting variable drug response. Many methods arebecoming available for the scoring of single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) the most common form of genetic variation in pharmacogeneticcorrelation studies. However most of these methods are not practical forlarge scale studies and thus have limited ability to meet industry demandsfor i) accuracy ii) reliability iii) operational simplicity iv) reproducibility v)automatability vi) low cost and vii) flexible formatting. Orchid BioScienceshas developed a proprietary SNP genotyping technology based on theprinciple of single base primer extension which is amenable to a variety ofmanual and automated platforms so as to enable a wide spectrum of phar macogenetic study designs ranging from large scale gene mapping andnew drug target discovery programs through to highly focused hypothesis based clinical pharmacogenetic correlation studies. Orchid is currentlyusing its technology to conduct pharmacogenetic association studies incollaboration with academic thought leaders across a broad range of ther apeutic areas through our rapidly expanding Clinical Genetics Network(CGN) program. Progress in selected trials underway to investigate dis ease predisposition and drug efficacy variability in more than 2200 patientsin therapeutic areas that include cardiovascular inflammatory and CNSdisorders will be presented. ,2001

1470,Turner syndrome (TS) occurs in approx. 1 of 2500 female births and iscaused by a total or partial deletion of one of the sex chromosomes in allor in some cells. Main clinical features are short stature and acceleratedrate of atresia of ovarian follicles causing gonadal insufficiency incompletepuberty and impaired fertility. Intelligence is usually in the normal range although impairments in spatial processing are common. An increased riskfor emotional and social difficulties has been reported but also a consid erable variability. The aim of the present study was to investigate psycho logical well being in women with TS compared with reference data and toinvestigate whether there was a relation between karyotype and well being. Method 63 women with TS (mean age 31.5 years) completed thePsychological General Well being Index (PGWB) covering the states ofanxiety depressed mood positive well being self control vitality and gen eral health. The scores were compared with a female reference group. Toexamine the possible relation to karyotype the participants with one copyof the p arm of the X chromosome according to karyotype (45 X and stru cutural abnormalities) (n=52) were compared to those with two copies ofthe p arm (45 X/46 XX) (n=11). Results The TS group rated their psycho logical well being at a similar level as the reference group. There was nosignificant difference in psychological well being according to karyotypegroup however there was a tendency for the group with two copies of thep arm to report higher levels of anxiety. Conclusion This study did not findevidence for impaired psychological well being in women with TS. The psy chological well being did not differ according to karyotype group however this questions should be investigated in studies with larger sample size. ,2001
1471,Ring chromosome 15 was detected in a 31 year old woman and her son. The mother had short stature (150 cm) slight mental retardation triangu lar face and dislocation of both hip joints. She married at the age of 27 andbecame pregnant 3 years later without examination and treatment. Her sonwas born at 40 weeks of gestation by c section. His weight was 2400 g hislength was 47 cm. Developmental abnormality was first suspected at 12months. He had short stature his weight was 6100 g length 65 cm occipitofrontal circumference 43 cm. Muscular hypotonia was obviousand early milestones of development were retarded. The boy sat at 8months crawled by 12 months walked unaided by 18 months and spokehis first words at the age of 18 months. At the age of 5 his height was 88cm weight 9380 g OFC 47 6 cm. Dysmorphic features included a trian gular face a big mouth hypotelorism thin hair white coffee spots on thebody hypogenitalism and a hypoplastic penis. Speech and mental devel opment was retarded. Chromosome analysis of the mother and her childrevealed ring chromosome 15 the break points in the ring chromosomebeing located at the same sites. The inheritance of the ring chromosomehas been reported rather infrequently. This occurrence is the third report(both the first and the second were from Japan) and the present case isthe first to be published in Russia.

In some patients this lack is associat ed with a deletion of the SNURF SNRPN exon 1 region inherited from thepaternal grandmother and the presence of a maternal imprint on the pater nal chromosome. Assuming that imprints are reset in the germline we andothers have suggested that this region constitutes part of the 15q imprint ing centre (IC) and is important for the maternal to paternal imprint switchin the male germ line. To investigate the effect of an IC deletion on theimprinting process in the male germline we analyzed sperm samples fromtwo males carrying such a deletion on their maternal chromosome. Onexamination of six differentially methylated sites at the MKRN3 NDN u1D u1B PW71/u1A and YL48E loci which are located upstream and down stream of the deletion we found that spermatozoa DNA from these twomales had a normal paternal methylation pattern. Similar findings weremade in a mouse model harboring a microdeletion of the Snurf Snrpn exon1 region. These findings indicate that the incorrect maternal methylationimprint in IC deletion patients is established de novo after fertilisation. Fur thermore we found that CpG rich regions in the SNURF SNRPN and NDNgenes which in somatic tissues are methylated on the maternal allele arehypomethylated in unfertilized human oocytes. These results suggest thatthe normal maternal methylation imprints in 15q11 q13 also are estab lished around or after fertilisation. ,2001
1472,We report a novel point mutation in the mitochondrial encoded ND6 sub unit of the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) in a patient withMELAS syndrome. The mutation is a missense mutation changing theamino acid alanine to valine in a highly conserved region of the ND6 sub unit. The mutation was heteroplasmic and found in both muscle and blood but was not detected in the patientÃÂ«s mother. A marked reduction of com plex I activity was found in the patients muscle. This is first case of a muta tion in the ND6 subunit causing MELAS. Our data confirm the genetic het erogeneity in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy lactic acidosis andstroke like episodes syndrome and confirms that MELAS can be causedby mutations in polypeptide coding mtDNA genes. ,2001
1473, aachen.deSilver Russell syndrome is characterised by intrauterine and postnatalgrowth retardation (IUGR/PNGR) typical craniofacial abnormalities com bined with asymmetry of head and limbs and other less frequent abnor malities. The majority of the 400 cases occurred sporadically but somefamilial cases indicate a genetic origin of the disease. Few cytogeneticaberrations have been published five cases involved chromosome 7 which is also subject to maternal uniparental disomy (matUPD) in 10% ofall SRS cases. The finding of matUPD7 indicates the involvement of atleast one imprinted gene on this chromosome. Three recently publishedSRS patients with cytogenetic duplications focussed the interest on7p11.2 p13 this chromosomal segment harbours the putative candidategenes EGFR GRB10 IGFBP1 and IGFBP3 which by mutation andimprinting analysis have already been excluded from playing a major role in the etiology of SRS. To estimate the frequency of duplications in 7p11.1 p13 we analysed 32 SRS patients by quantitative PCR. A multiplex PCRwith the CFTR gene as control and an internal standard as reference forthe amount of DNA was performed. We tested the genes EGFR GRB10 IGFBP1 and IGFBP3 and one microsatellite within the possibly duplicatedregion but we did not detect any rearrangement. Additionally we havestarted to investigate SRS patients and patients with idiopathicIUGR/PNGR by FISH. We are using 3 YACS hybridising to the regions7p11.2 7p13 and 7p13 14. These probes were shown to be duplicated inprevious studies. So far no triple signals were observed thus confirmingthe results obtained by the quantitative approach. ,2001

1475,Russell Silver syndrome (RSS) is a form of congenital dwarfism charac terized by severe growth retardation and variable dysmorphic features. RSS is considered to be an imprinting disease because 10% of sporadicpatients demonstrate maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) of chromo some 7. Although 3 genes on chromosome 7 (MEST gamma2COP andGRB10) are shown to be imprinted in human or mouse several lines ofevidence exclude their involvement in RSS suggesting the existence ofadditional imprinted gene(s) on chromosome 7 which contribute to the dis ease. Two RSS patients were identified with de novo cytogenetic abnor malities involving the short arm of chromosome 7. One had a partial dupli cation [46 XX dup(7)(p12p14)] and the second contained a paracentricinversion [46 XY inv(7)(p14p21)].

One positional genomic strategyinvolves application of association methodology to areas of identified link age. Detection of association in the presence of linkage localizes thegene(s) of interest to more refined regions in the genome than is possiblethrough linkage analysis alone. This strategy introduces a statistical com plexity when family based association tests are used the marker geno types among siblings are correlated in linked regions. Ignoring this corre lation will compromise the size of the statistical hypothesis test thus cloud ing the interpretation of test results. We present a method for computingthe expectation of a wide range of association test statistics under the nullhypothesis that there is linkage but no association. To standardize the teststatistic an empirical variance covariance estimator that is robust to thesibling marker genotype correlation is used. For example we analyze adeletion in the A2M gene at the 5 splice site of Ã¢\x80\x98exon ii of the bait regionin Alzheimer disease (AD) discordant sibships. Since the A2M gene lies ina chromosomal region (chromosome 12p) that consistently has beenlinked to AD association test should be conducted under the null hypoth esis that there is linkage but no association. ,2001
1477,Hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) is an autosomal dominant disor der characterised by episodic local subcutaneous and submucosal edemaaffecting the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. It is caused bythe deficiency of activated C1 esterase inhibitor protein (C1 INH type Ideficiency reduced serum level type II deficiency reduced activity) whosefunction is preventing unnecessary activation of the complement system. The aim of the present study is to determine the disease causing muta tions among Hungarian HANE patients. The estimated number of affectedHANE families in Hungary is approximately 40 50 out of which 30 families(type I 25 type II 5) are managed in a single center in Budapest. To detectlarge deletions and insertions which supposedly occur exclusively in typeI HANE patients with an approximate frequency of 20% we use Southern blotting analysis with BclI and BglII digestions. In the absence of large structural changes we employ single strand conformational polymorphism(SSCP) analysis covering the whole coding region and splicing sites of theC1 INH gene by 15 primer pairs (overlapping PCR products shorter than200 bp) with silver staining detection. The determinations are currently inprogress so far large deletions were detected by Southern blotting in 3/19HANE type I families. The SSCP analyses completed so far showedaltered patterns in exon 8 in eight HANE patients in seven type II patientswe identified the disease causing mutation (Arg444Cys) by sequencing. Inthe remaining type I patient a Val458Met amino acid change was found. Our program provides definite molecular diagnosis and opens the possi bility for prenatal diagnostics. ,2001
1478,Non syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness (NSRD) is one of themost common human sensory disorders. Mutations in the connexin 26gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadicnon syndromic deafness in different populations. The CX26 gene encodesthe gap junction protein connexin 26 (beta 2 GJB2) whose expression was shown in several tissues and in the cochlea. The 30delG mutation isthe most frequent mutation in the CX26 gene. It represents a deletion of aguanosine (G) in a sequence of six G extending from position 30 to 35 ofthe CX26 cDNA. The deletion creates a frameshift resulting in a prematurestop codon and a non functional intracellular domain in the protein. The30delG mutation can be detected at the molecular level using PCR fol lowed by BsiYl digestion. We now screened 100 control individuals and250 patients with non syndromic sporadic deafness for this mutation todetermine their distribution in the German and Hungarian populations. Thefrequency of the 30delG mutation in the German pool of sporadic caseswas 0.11 wheras in controls it was 0.04. While studying 24 small sizedHungarian families this frequency was 0.38.DNA from individuals showing a heterozygous status for 30delG wassequenced. This study revealed several new patient related mutations andnew gene variants resulting in e.g. amino acid substitutions (A >G basicto acidic G >A nonpolar to polar A >C acidic to nonpolar). Moreover onedeletion and one insertion was noted. In summary more than 20 new allel ic changes were detected and for most of them patterns of inheritancewere documented. ,2001
1479, erlangen.deLoss of function mutations in the Elastin gene (ELN) have been demon strated to be responsible for nonsyndromic supravalvular aortic stenosis(SVAS). SVAS is an obstructive vascular disorder that causes hemody namically significant narrowing of large arteries. Although the aorta is themost frequently diseased any artery can be affected including the pul monary carotid and coronary arteries. The onset and severity of the vas cular disease in SVAS is variable. If untreated this disorder can lead toheart failure myocardial infarction and death. SVAS occurs with an inci dence of 1 in 20 000 life births. It can be inherited as an isolated autoso mal dominant trait or as one symptom of Williams Beuren syndrome acomplex developmental disorder characterized by cardiovascular neu robehavioral facial connective tissue and metabolic abnormalities. Innonsyndromic SVAS patients up to now 14 different mutations have beenreported in the Elastin gene. As mutations are distributed all over the gene mutation analysis is time consuming and cost intensive. Therefore weestablished the DHPLC method for mutational screening of all 34 codingexons and flanking introns. In order to reduce false positive heteroduplexformations PCR conditions had to be optimized for DHPLC. Temperatureand buffer gradient conditions were elaborated for each exon to optimizeelution profiles. DHPLC analysis were performed in five unrelated SVASpatients and available family members. Fragments with normal (wild type)sequence were used as controls. We identified the same disease causingmutation (exon 10 K176X) in two non consanguineous patients by DHPLCand sequencing. In addition elution profiles with heteroduplex formationwere observed in 8 out of 34 exons analyzed. Whether these heteroduplexpattern are due to a mutation or a polymorphism have to be proved bysequencing. ,2001
1480,The underlying mutation causing Huntington Disease is the expansion of aCAG trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of IT 15 gene beyond a certainrepeat number. IT 15 has also some other polymorphic features that maybe associated with CAG repeat number. In this study the distribution ofpolymorphic features identified in the first exon and 5 promoter region ofthe gene was investigated on normal and mutant alleles seperately. Poly morphic features included in the study are 6 and 20 base pairs (bp)repeats (GGGGGC and GGCCCCGCCTCCGCCGGCGC namely) andG? A and C? T point mutations located on 5 promoter region and CAG andCCG repeats in the first exon of the gene. PCR and DNA sequencing wasperformed following genomic DNA isolation from peripheral blood samplesof patients after obtaining their informed consent. The method of choiceenabled a clear investigation of these polymorphic features both in wildPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 381type and mutant alleles seperately. CAG repeat number was found to be in the range of 17 25 and 41 51 on normal and mutant alleles respectively. Only two alleles of CCG repeats 7 and 10 repeats were observed and 10repeats of CCG was only seen in mutant alleles. 6 and 20 bp repeat num bers were 1 and 2 respectively for all normal and mutant alleles except fortwo normal alleles one with 2 repeats of 6 bp and one with 3 repeats of 20bp. The nucleotides seen in G >A and C >T positions were G and C respec tively in all normal and mutant alleles. To our knowledge this is the firstreport on HD alleles investigating 5 promoter region polymorphic featuresrelative to CAG repeat number on normal and mutant alleles seperately. ,2001
1481, hamburg.deMalignant hyperthermia(MH) is a rare autosomal dominant pharmacoge netic trait which can manifest itself in persons with genetic predispositionin an acute life threatening form during general anaesthesia. Porcinestress syndrome has similar symptoms like the MH and has been tracedback to a point mutation in ryanodine receptor(RYR1)gene. Mutationanalysis in human RYR1 gene has shown uptil now about 25 mutationswhich could be associated with MH predisposition. Human stress syn drome (HSS) is a very rare condition which is triggered by a very warmenvironment or excessive bodily stress leading to well known crisis similarto MH. In a large collective of MH and some HSS patients we performedmutation analysis of 14 selected exons of RYR1 gene in DNA from bloodby employing the techniques of SSCP and fluorescence based directsequencing. Apart from already known mutations we found four novelmutations A1435G G6385A A6566G C7258T two of them in patientsexpressing HSS. These results further confirm our previous suggestionthat MH and HSS seem to be part of the same large syndrome. In order tofurther confirm these observations a screen in cDNA from muscle from abigger collective of patients especially HSS patients is being attempted inorder to examine all the exons of RYR1 gene. ,2001
1482,Congenital afibrinogenemia (MIM # 202400) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the complete absence of circulating fibrinogen. Our recent studies on the molecular basis of the disease showed that themost common genetic defect is a donor splice mutation in FGA intron 4 IVS4+1G>T. Because it was impossible to directly study the effect of this mutation on mRNA splicing in patient hepatocytes and illegitimate RT PCR from leukocyte RNA was unsuccessful we used a transfected cellapproach. COS 7 cells expressing the control FGA genomic construct pro duced only correctly spliced mRNA molecules whereas cells expressingthe IVS4 mutant construct produced only abnormal transcripts which wereindividually cloned for identification. Multiple cryptic donor splice sites situ ated in exon 4 and intron 4 were found to be utilized. One of these situat ed 4 bp downstream of the normal site was used in 85% of transcriptsresulting in a 4 bp insertion frameshift leading to premature truncation ofFGA. Our results confirm the validity of this approach to study mRNAsplice site mutations and demonstrate that the common FGA IVS4+1G>Tvariant is a null mutation leading to afibrinogenemia. Cloning the RT PCRproducts allows the identification of rare aberrant transcripts that wouldhave been missed by simply sequencing the total product. Two other muta tions affecting donor sites in FGA IVS1+3G>A and IVS3+1_+4delGTAA and one acceptor site mutation in FGG IVS2 3C>G have been identifiedin patients with congenital afibrinogenemia. The respective genomic con structs are currently being expressed in COS 7 cells to assess their effecton mRNA splicing. ,2001
1483,Mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) is a recessive neurodegenerative lysosomalstorage disorder manifested with psychomotor retardation and ophthalmo logical abnormalities including cornea opacities retina degeneration andstrabismus. The disease is found in relatively high frequency amongAshkenazi Jews. MLIV is one of the few lysosomal storage disorders inwhich neither the basic metabolic defect nor the relevant gene had beenidentified hitherto. We undertook positional cloning which led to the identi fication of a novel gene on human chromosome 19p13.2 13.3. The gene MCOLN1 is expressed in all the human tissues examined and encodes aputative protein Mucolipin1 that was found to be a member of a new fam ily the mucolipins. The putative protein of 580 amino acids is a calciumchannel containing 6 transmembrane domains and a serine lipase andnuclear localization signal motives. MLIV causing mutations were identifiedin MCOLN1 two of which were found in 95% of the MLIV alleles in theJewish Askenazi families (72% for the first mutation and 23% for the sec ond). The 2 mutations correlated with specific haplotypes in this region. Homozygotes for each of these mutations as well as compound heterozy gotes showed all similar clinical phenotype. Six other MLIV causing muta tions in the MCOLN1 gene were also identified mostly among non JewishMLIV patients. The identification of the gene involved with MLIV finally per mits accurate patients diagnosis including prenatal diagnosis and het erozygotes identification. Heterozygote frequency was found to be 1/100 inthe Ashkenazi population. Since 2 mutations accounts for 95% of the MLIValleles in the Ashkenazi population it will enable population screening inthis ethnic group for the ascertainment of high risk couples before the birthof the first affected child. The lysosomal storage in MLIV stems from abnor mal endocytosis process from late endosomes to lysosomes. The charac terization of the protein involved with this process will permit a deeperunderstanding for this process and the defect in this ,2001
1484, dresden.deThe triple A syndrome (MIM*231550) is a rare autosomal recessive disor der characterized by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) resistant adre nal failure achalasia and alacrima as well as a variety of neurological fea tures. Haplotype analysis of 47 triple A families allowed us to refine the crit ical region from 6 cM to a genetic segment of 0 cM between KRT8 andD12S1651. After construction of a high resolution BAC/PAC contig of thisregion we identified a novel gene designated AAAS (Achalasia Addisoni anism Alacrima Syndrome gene) encoding a protein of 546 amino acids382 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorderswhich is mutated in all affected individuals. We found 19 different mutations scattered over the coding sequence including 3 splice mutations. Mostmutations lead to a truncated protein suggesting loss of function. The pro tein shows high similarities (over 90 %) to putative proteins from Sus scro fa Bos taurus Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus suggesting a con served structure and function in mammals. RNA blotting experimentsrevealed ubiquitous expression with a higher level in neuroendocrine andgastrointestinal structures which are predominantly affected in triple A syn drome. The predicted protein belongs to the WD repeat family of regulato ry proteins. At the C terminal end it contains the tripeptide Ser His Leu aspecific peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1) raising the possibility thatthe AAAS gene product may function as a peroxisomal protein. ,2001
1485, ulm.deThe major cause of fragile X syndrome is mutational expansion of the CGGrepeat in gene FMR1 hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. Most fragile X embryos develop somatic mosaicism of disease causing full expansions of different lengths. Homogeneity of the mosaic patterns among multiple tissues indicates that these unstable expansions aquiremitotic stability in early fetal life. As mitotic stability is found strictly associ ated with hypermethylation in adult tissues current theory fixes the time ofinstability to developmental stages when fully expanded CGG repeats existin an unmethylated state. Murine EC cells (PC13) were used as a modelsystem of pluripotent embryonic cells. Hypermethylated and unmethylatedfull expansions on human chromosomes were transferred from murine A9hybrids into EC cells by microcell fusion. As demonstrated for the first time even full expansion alleles that were fully methylated and stable in thedonors fibroblasts and in A9 as well became demethylated reactivated and destabilized in undifferentiated EC hybrids. When destabilized expan sions were reintroduced from EC cells into A9 instability was reversed tostability. Our results strongly support that fully expanded alleles are initial ly unstable and unmethylated in the human embryo and gain stability upongenetic or epigenetic change of the embryonic cells. ,2001
1486,Primary lymphoedema is chronic tissue oedema most frequently of one orboth lower limbs resulting from an intrinsic fault in lymph conducting path ways. There is a strong genetic component with 35% of patients showinga positive family history and there are 3 three main autosomal dominantforms of the disorder Milroy s disease (congenital) and Lymphoedema distichiasis (LD) and Meige s disease where the onset is at or after puber ty. In LD features associated with the tissue swelling include eyelashesarising inappropriately from the meibomian glands (distichiasis) heartanomalies and cleft palate. We established linkage of LD to 16q24.3 (Man gion et al Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999 65 427 432) and the gene mutated inLD has very recently been established as FOXC2 a member of the fork head/winged helix family of transcription factors. (Fang et al Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000 67 1382 1388 R. Bell unpublished data). Fang et al report ed prematurely terminating mutations in FOXC2 in two families with LD and we have analysed the 10 LD families on our database for mutations inthis gene. We have found 4 deletions and 5 insertions scattered through out the gene all of which produce frameshifts that would lead to prematuretermination of the protein. These data support the proposition that FOXC2mutations in LD act in a haploinsufficient manner. ,2001
1487, wuerzburg.deLymphedema distichiasis (LD MIM #153400) is a rare autosomal domi nant disorder with variable penetrance presenting mainly with lymphede ma of the limbs and a double row of eyelashes. Recently Fang et al. (Am. J .Hum. Gen 67 1382 1388 2000) described two unrelated families suf fering from LD and carrying inactivating mutations in one allele of theFOXC2 gene. FOXC2 is a member of the forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors whose members are involved in diverse developmentpathways. The gene produces a 2.2 kb transcript encoded by a 1.5 kb sin gle exon that is highly GC rich. To test the hypothesis whether FOXC2 mutations cause lymphedema distichiasis in general we studied a familywith LD in two generations presenting a variable phenotype. By SSCP analysis and subsequent sequencing we identified an insertion of guaninwithin a stretch of five guanins beginning at position 867 of the FOXC2 gene in the two clinical affected children. This frame shift mutation resultsin a stop codon leading to a truncated form of the FOXC2 protein. Themutations described by Fang et al. also resulted in stop codons and werelocalized at positions 297 and 1093. Our results confirm the hypothesisthat an inactivating mutation of one allel of the FOXC2 gene is causing LD. Also further studies have to confirm that there is no evidence for hetero geneity in LD. Because of the variable clinical features a mutational analy sis of FOXC2 gene may give better insights in the pathogenesis of the dis ease e.g. the identification of a phenotype genotype correlation. ,2001
1488,Lymphedema Distachiasis syndrome (LD {MIM153400}) is a diverse heri table condition whose primary components edematous limbs and an extrarow of eyelashes are often seen amid a spectrum of other features includ ing craniofacial cardiovascular and vertebral abnormalities. FOXC2 amember of the winged helix forkhead transcription factor family containsa highly conserved 110 bp DNA binding domain which has been implicat ed in such developmental processes as determining embryonic cell fate initiating and maintaining tissue differentiation and tumorigenesis later inlife. Recent identification of FOXC2 mutations in 2 LD families (AJHG 2000Dec 67(6)1382 88) has placed this gene in a favorable position to explainthe phenotypic complexity found in LD. Here we report identification of fiveadditional FOXC2 mutations in six lymphedema families four of whichexhibit distachiasis. Of the two not reporting distachiasis one familydemonstrates an additional feature consistent with the LD syndrome namely cleft palate. Onset of lymphedema was pubertal in nearly all cases. Direct sequencing of FOXC2 revealed both single nucleotide and inser tion/deletion mutations occurring in or near the forkhead domain. All muta tions observed are predicted to cause early termination of the FOXC2 pro tein. We speculate that the clinical heterogeneity seen in Lymphedema Distachiasis syndrome is the result of haploinsufficiency of this develop mental gene and further investigation into the FOXC2 expression patternmay elucidate its role in lymphatic development and its interaction withother developmental genes. ,2001
1489,Lymphedema Distichiasis is a syndrome which includes ocular abnormali ties pubertal onset lymphedema congenital heart defects and cleft palate(OMIM 153400). Other lymphedema syndromes include Yellow Nail Syn drome (OMIM 153300) and Lymphedema Ptosis (OMIM 153000). Wereport on the phenotype of six families in our study as well as two pub lished families all with mutations in the FOXC2 gene on 16q24. The sixcaucasian families from our study were ascertained through our Lym phedema Family Study website (www.pitt.edu/~genetics/lymph) orGeneTests Inc. (www.genetests.org). Included in these eight families were42 affected individuals and/or mutation carriers. Two were aborted fetuseswith hydrops and two mutation carriers were completely normal. Lym phedema with an average onset age of 15 was present in 31 individuals. Among the 9 individuals without lymphedema 7 were between the ages of6 and 14 and presumably presymptomatic. Distichiasis was present in 21individuals from six families. Tetralogy of Fallot cleft palate ptosis cystichygroma and fetal hydrops were observed in at least one member of thesefamilies. Yellow nails was present in one family with lymphedema distichi asis and ptosis. Phenotypic and allelic heterogeneity and variable expres sion characterize families with mutations in nan,2001
1490,Primary lymphoedema is a chronic tissue swelling most frequently of thelower limbs resulting from deficient lymphatic drainage. We have previ ously reported a locus for primary congenital lymphoedema (PCL) whereonset is at birth to the most telomeric portion of chromosome 5q35.3.Mutations have been reported in the vascular endothelial growth factor 3receptor (VEGFR 3) gene which lies within this region. We have analysedan additional 5 families with PCL and shown them to be consistent withlinkage to 5q35.3. Furthermore we describe a G to A transition in VEGFR 3 which results in Q for R substitution at amino acid 1041. This substitu tion affects a residue in a highly conserved region of the catalytic loop inthe kinase domain of VEGFR 3 and by in vitro studies has been shown tointerfere with the receptor tyrosyl phosphorylation. Thus defective VEGFR 3 signalling seems to be one cause of PCL in families linked to 5q35.3. ,2001
1491,Our overall aim is to understand the molecular pathogenesis of autosomalrecessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix Saguenay (ARSACS/SACS MIM#270550) a unique early onset disease. Although rare elsewhere a foundereffect increased disease frequency in the population of northeastern Que bec in Canada. We mapped the gene to chromosome 13q11 (Richter et al AJHG 64 768 1999) . We identified the 11.7 kb single exon sacsin geneand detected two mutations g.6594delT (DT) and the rare g.5254C>T non sense mutation (Engert et al Nature Genetics 24 120 2000). Analyses ofthe 437 kD predicted sacsin protein with sequence comparison tools didnot reveal extensive similarity to known proteins although the presence ofheat shock domains suggest a role in chaperone mediated protein folding. To facilitate molecular diagnosis and gene carrier detection we developedan ASO based mutation detection method. The analysis of 164 independ ent ARSACS alleles revealed that 152 (92.7%) carried the DT and 6 (3.7%) the C>T mutation. For 6 ARSACS alleles (3.7%) we have yet to iden tify the mutation. This unknown mutation(s) is/are always carried in theheterozygous form with the frequent DT mutation. The identification ofthese rare alleles is now underway. Sacsin was identified entirely using asequence based approach. We cloned sacsin fragments in expressionvectors and produced anti sacsin antibodies to specific fragments. Thecloning of full length sacsin to obtain Abs to the complete protein is under way. The use of these different Ab species to detect the presence and cel lular distribution of sacsin protein in control and ARSACS patient cells willbe described. Understanding the function of sacsin is the first step in thedevelopment of possible treatment options and may have relevance to theunderstanding of other progressive neurodegenerative diseases. ,2001
1492, u.ac.jpWe previously reported that the 14q13 translocation breakpoint in a patientwith mirror image polydactyly lies between D14S75 and D14S306 within acomplete BAC/PAC contig (Genomics 1997). A novel gene named mirror image polydactyly gene 1 (MIPD1) was found to be disrupted by thebreakpoint. The MIPD1 gene consists of 17 exons and spans a 450 kbgenomic region. All exon intron boundaries were determined using genom ic sequences in this contig map. The expression is detectable in the adultheart liver skeletal muscle kidney and pancreas but not in the adult brainlung or placenta by Northern blot analysis. MIPD1 has a coiled coil domain in the C terminus but no homology to any known genes. Mutation analysisfor two patients with mirror image polydactyly and a whole mount in situhybridization in the developing limb bud in mouse embryos are now inprogress. ,2001
1493,Mutations of novel podocyte genes NPHS1 and NPHS2 are typically asso ciated with Finnish type congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNF) and autoso mal recessive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) respectively. We examined genotype/phenotype correlation of NPHS1/NPHS2 muta tions to a) characterise accurately the mutation phenotype and b) furtheridentify their role in the pathogenesis of glomerular protein leak. Methods.47 patients and 50 normal controls were analysed. NPHS1 and NPHS2exons were PCR amplified and products sequenced on an ABI 377. Phe notypic diagnosis was based on clinical and family history and/or renalbiopsy. 38/47 patients had CNF 4/47 congenital FSGS and 5/47 earlyonset (1 year) FSGS. All presented with severe nephrotic syndrome but disease progression was uncharacteristically mild in 9 CNF patients. Results. 30/38 CNF patients had NPHS1 mutations and 2/30 carried aspecific additional NPHS2 mutation R229Q a putative hypomorphicallele. 2 of 8 CNF patients lacking NPHS1 mutations had NPHS2 muta tions. One NPHS1 mutation R1160X previously connected with severe disease was consistently associated with the milder CNF phenotype. Allpatients with congenital FSGS had concomitant mutations in NPHS1 andNPHS2. Mutations were absent in early onset FSGS. Conclusions. Geno type/phenotype correlation detected overlap between NPHS1 and NPHS2mutations with co existence of mutations in both genes in congenitalFSGS and rarely CNF. In addition the association of R1160X with mildand severe CNF indicates genetic/metabolic interference unconnectedwith NPHS2 mutations. Our findings advocate a functional interrelationshipbetween NPHS1 and NPHS2 within the podocyte further supporting theirintegral role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria. ,2001
1494,Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a genetic disorder resulting from aheterozygous deletion of contiguous genes at 7q11.23. Large blocks ofregion specific low copy repeat elements (LCRs A B and C) predispose toa common ~1 6 Mb deletion through unequal crossing over mostlybetween the centromeric and medial LCR blocks B. These blocks share>99.5% sequence identity along ~120 Kb and contain three genes at themedial location (GTF2I NCF1 and GTF2IL) with the correspondingpseudogenes at the centromeric side as well as a high density of SINE(44%). A third block B with pseudogenes lies more telomeric. In this study we have defined the deletion breakpoints in 35 WBS patients using copy specific nucleotide differences. Most patients (33/35) exhibited the typical1 6 Mb deletion caused by recombination between the centromeric andmedial blocks B. Junction fragments were mapped within GTF2I/P1 orGTF2I NCF1 intergenic in 19 cases (58%) NCF1/P1 in 9 (27%) NCF1 GTF2IL intergenic in 2 (6%) and GTF2IL/P1 in 3 (9%). Sequencing acrossthe junction fragment in two cases revealed the presence of Alu repeats. Only 2 patients had a larger deletion likely due to recombination betweenblocks A. No correlation was found between the different deletions and theclinical phenotype. Our data indicate that 1 hemizygousity at NCF1and/or GTF2IL does not affect the WBS phenotype 2 unequal homolo gous recombination causing WBS is a precise mechanism that preferen tially occurs in LCR regions of extremely high sequence identity and rich inrepeat elements but without specific hot spots within them. ,2001
1495,Rett syndrome is an X linked dominant neurological disorder whichappears to be the commonest genetic cause of profound combined intel 384 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorderslectual and physical disability in Caucasian females. Recently this syn drome has been associated with mutations of the MECP2 gene a tran scriptional repressor of still unknown target genes. We present the resultsof a MECP2 mutation analysis of Italian and British RTT females themajority of which show the classical phenotype. An overall mutation fre quency of roughly 70 % was detected and several new mutations identi fied. We were able to trace a hot spot map for MECP2 mutations analyz ing our data and the published results for different populations. The popu lations analyzed show six most common mutations which account for the62% of the cases. Using this strategy we established the high occurrenceof Ã¢\x80\x94COOH terminal deletions in the patients analyzed. In this region of theMeCP2 protein database comparisons identified a potential new structur al domain common to other regulatory genes all significantly expressed inbrain. The combined approach of mutational and bioinformatic analysis letus to add a number of observations. Such analysis could become the basisfor a genotype phenotype correlation. However this was not feasible here as the majority of cases in our study population have classical RTT. ,2001
1496, u.ac.jpRett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting exclu sively females with regression loss of speech and purposeful hand useafter 6 months of almost normal development. Since DNA mutations in themethyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) were detected in patientswith RTT in 1999 many different mutations in MECP2 have been reportednot only in patients with classic RTT but also in patients with non specificmental retardation. However genotype phenotype correlation of MECP2mutations has not been established. In this study we have screened DNAmutations MECP2 in 100 Japanese sporadic patients with clinical diagno sis of RTT by child neurologists. We identified 35 different causative muta tions in 85 patients (85% of patients examined) 13 missense mutations in39 patients 6 nonsense mutations in 30 patients and 15 frameshift muta tions in 15 patisnts and one splicing anomaly in one patient with RTT. Thecommon mutations of MECP2 were T158M and R168X in our patients detected in 12 and 9 classic RTT patients respectively. On the other hand R133C and R294X were predominantly detected in patients with preservedspeech vatiant form of RTT detected in 4 in 6 patients with R133C and 3in 6 patients with R294X. Skewed X inactivation was not obserbed inthese patients. Although effect of X inactivation on phenotypes have beenrepresented the types of MECP2 mutations may also effect on pheno types of RTT. ,2001
1497,Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in10 000 to 15 000 female births worldwide. Mutations in the MECP2(methyl CpG binding protein 2) gene mapped on chromosome Xq28 cause RTT. MeCP2 contains both a methyl CpG binding domain (MBD)and a transcriptional repression domain (TRD) and participates in tran scriptional silencing via DNA methylation. We analyzed three exons of theMECP2 gene from the peripheral blood of 30 Korean patients with RTT byPCR and direct sequencing. We detected mutations of MECP2 in 20 cases(66.7%) of the 30 RTT patients. The mutations consisted of 12 typesincluding 9 missense and 3 nonsense mutations. Of these three (L100V G161E and T311M) mutations were newly identified and five (T158M R168X R255X R270X R306C) mutations were frequently generated. Mutations involved MBD and TRD were showed 8 cases (40%) and 7cases (35%) of 20 current mutations respectively. Therefore these muta tions found in the functional domains may critically affect the function ofMECP2. We found that most MECP2 mutations were confined in the exon3 (19 of 20 mutations). So it is suggested that the sequence analysis ofexon 3 should be done at first to screen mutation in nan,2001
1498,Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a progressive X linked dominant neurodevelop mental disorder affecting 1/10 000 15 000 females. The disease causinggene was identified as MECP2 on chromosome Xq28 and mutations have been found in ~80% of patients diagnosed with RTT. We started mutation al screening on MECP2 exon 2 and 3 in 52 RTT patients. As a first step we screened for six known mutations R106W P152R T158M R306C R168X F155S and one polymorphism E397K. We found R106W in threepatients P152R in two patients T158M in four patients and R306C in fourpatients. Mutations R168X and F155S were not detected in our patients. Only one patient had E397K polymorphism who also bears R306C muta tion. In exon 3 of MECP2 there are several known deletion type of muta tions. By PCR analysis two patients were found to have ~ 26 bp deletionin exon 3. In order to confirm this mutation we are performing sequencinganalysis at the moment. As a result of this initial screening MECP2 muta tions were identified in ~ 30 % of the Turkish patients diagnosed with RTT. We will further analyze MECP2 by direct DNA sequencing in patients not found to have a mutation by restriction endonuclease analysis. ,2001
1499, hamburg.deInfantile malignant osteopetrosis is a rare and fatal disease that usuallybegins during the first postnatal weeks. Leading signs are a massiveincrease in bone density absence of marrow cavities in the long bones andanemia due to insufficient extramedullary blood production that furthercauses hepatosplenomegaly. The only currently available cure is bonemarrow transplantation. As the osteoclast is thought to be the only cellcapable of degrading bone it was likely that the cause of the disease wasa defect in osteoclast function. These cells degrade bone material in atightly sealed extracellular compartment that is acidified by a V type H+ ATPase. Recently a new isoform of the membrane spanning a subunit ofthis H+ pump was cloned shown to be expressed in osteoclasts and itsgene was mapped close to a locus for infantile osteopetrosis. Further mutations in the corresponding mouse gene were found to cause anosteopetrotic phenotype. In 9 out of 12 patients with infantile malignantosteopetrosis we now demonstrate mutations in OC116/TCIRG1 thegene encoding the a3 subunit of the V ATPase from osteoclasts. On theother hand a patient from a consanguineous family was heterozygous atthe OC116/TCIRG1 locus suggesting that a mutation in a different geneunderlies osteopetrosis in that pedigree. Analysis of further samples is cur rently being carried out. Our work shows that mutations in the gene encod ing the a3 subunit of the proton pump are a rather common cause of infan tile malignant osteopetrosis and suggests that this disease is geneticallyheterogeneous. ,2001
1500,Mutations in the extracellular domains of the 55 kDa TNF receptor(TNFRSF1A) define a dominantly inherited periodic fever syndromeTRAPS that is characterized by prolonged attacks of recurrent fevers ster ile peritonitis arthralgia myalgia rash and/or conjunctivitis (MIM142680).TRAPS can be distinguished from familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)based on ethnic background duration of attacks and poor response tocolchicine. We have previously described 6 disease associatedPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 385TNFRSF1A mutations (C30R C33Y T50M C52F C88R and C88Y) 5 of which disrupt conserved extracellular cysteines. In a survey of additionalpatients with unexplained periodic fevers (150) we have identified 6 newTNFRSF1A mutations in 28 patients H22Y C33G P46L S86P R92Q c.193 14 G> A and one mutation ( C30S) that has been recently reported. This brings the total number of TRAPS mutations to date to 14 all of themmissense substitutions with 7 involving cysteine residues. We also reportreduced penetrance for several of the mutations C33Y T50M P46L R92Q and c.193 14 G> A. The c.193 14 G> A R92Q and T50M muta tions occurred at CpG hotspots and were observed in patients of diverseethnic descent. Haplotype analysis showed evidence for a common intra genic (TNFRSF1A ) founder for R92Q even among patients of very distinctbackground (9/9 shared a microsatellite/ SNP haplotype that is veryuncommon in the general population). However there were independentfounders for the other two mutations. Our analysis thus far does notexplain the skewed ethnic distribution of TRAPS patients (Irish / Scottish)on the basis of a common mutation or founder chromosome. ,2001
1501,Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder charac terised by obesity post axial polydactyly retinal dystrophy hypogonadism cognitive deficit and renal disease. There exists substantial genetic andphenotypic heterogeneity which until now has hindered efforts to position ally clone the six known BBS loci. Our collection of 163 pedigrees ofdiverse ethnic origin has been evaluated for mutations in the recently dis covered BBS6 gene (MKKS) on 20p12 and for potential assignment to anyof the other known BBS loci. Through haplotype analysis of all pedigrees we report substantially reduced critical intervals for BBS2 3 and 5. Fur thermore we identified nine missense alterations each potentially patho genic in MKKS from eight pedigrees each of which segregate with the dis ease. In only one of these pedigrees were we able to identify both muta tions. However three of the remaining pedigrees in which alterations werefound were also compatible with linkage to a separate BBS locus. More over through autozygosity mapping of a further cohort of consanguineouskindreds from Turkey Iraq and Pakistan we noted that a single Pakistanipedigree mapped to two separate BBS loci. These data suggest thatalthough BBS6 is a minor contributor to the syndrome some BBS6 allelesmay act in conjunction with mutations at other BBS loci to cause or modi fy the BBS phenotype. ,2001
1502,Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder predom inantly characterized by obesity retinal dystrophy polydactyly learning dif ficulties hypogenitalism and renal malformations with secondary featuresthat include diabetes mellitus endocrinological dysfunction and behavioralabnormalities. Despite an initial expectation of genetic homogeneity due torelative clinical uniformity five BBS loci have been reported with evidencefor additional loci in the human genome. We performed a genome screenwith BBS families from Newfoundland that were excluded from BBS1 5and identified linkage with D20S189. Fine mapping reduced the criticalinterval to 1.9 cM between D20S851 and D20S189 encompassing a chap eronin like gene in which mutations were reported recently to be associ ated with McKusick Kaufman syndrome (MKKS). Given both the mappingposition and clinical similarities of these two syndromes we screenedMKKS and identified mutations in five Newfoundland and two European American BBS pedigrees. The majority are frameshift alleles which arelikely to result in a non functional protein. Our data thus suggest that a complete loss of function of the MKKS product and thus an inability to folda range of target proteins is responsible for the clinical manifestations ofBBS. Furthermore in contrast to adult tissues where MKKS expressionwas widespread at stable levels we have found the abundance of MKKSmRNA to vary significantly during early development with strong expres sion correlating to sites of disease such as the heart branchial arches andthe developing limb bud suggesting that the onset Bardet Biedl syndromemay be as early as the fifth week of human development. ,2001
1503,We performed molecular studies in 38 NF1 microdeletion patients. Twen ty two out of 27 microdeletions where the parental origin could be studiedwere of maternal origin (81%) and 5 were of paternal origin. Thirty sevenof the 38 microdeletions have a 1.5 Mb size with breakpoints in flankingparalogous sequences (NF1 REPs).These paralogous sequences are>100 kb long and represent duplicated sequences in a direct orientationwith 98% homology. At least 5 expressed sequences are present in theflanking paralogous sequences. Additional paralogous sequences arepresent on chromosome 17 and on other chromosomes. The same paral ogous sequences are also present in Gorilla and Bonobo but not in mice. Further molecular analysis of the 37 cases with breakpoints in the flankingparalogous sequences showed that 19 microdeletion breakpoints clus tered in a 2 kb region. There was no specific structure present at the break points responsible for the meiotic recombination process. Conversionevents in the breakpoint region were documented in at least two cases. These data show that about 50% of NF1 microdeletions originate from anunequal recombination between paralogous sequences on the homolo gous chromosomes 17 during the first meiotic division. This recombina tional process interrupts a gene in the flanking NF1 REPs and deletes 4expressed sequences located in the telomeric NF1 REP. Aside from theNF1 gene with its three embedded genes and the expressed sequences inthe paralogous regions at least 13 other expressed sequences are local ized in the microdeletion region. We are currently investigating the role ofthese deleted genes for the specific phenotype in these microdeletionpatients. ,2001
1504,We present clinical molecular and mapping evidence for a novel gene thatpotentiates the formation of dermal neurofibromas in patients with neurofi bromatosis type 1 (NF1). Patients carrying a l.5 Mb contiguous gene dele tion that includes NF1 are remarkable for an early age at onset and aheavy burden of dermal neurofibromas relative to age. Using molecularmapping techniques and sequencing we found that the NF1 gene isflanked by 80kb DNA elements (NF1REPs) which share >97% nucleotideidentity and facilitate the homologous recombination event that generatesthe deletion. Unexpectedly the deletion breakpoints of the majority ofpatients were clustered in a 6 kb recombination hotspot within theNF1REPs. Therefore NF1 microdeletions occur predominantly at thesame site and delete the same set of genes. We hypothesize that thesevere tumor phenotype is due to the deletion of both NF1 and a novelneurofibroma potentiating locus (NPL). The location of this putative tumormodifier has been narrowed to <700 kb by the identification of patients withnovel shorter deletions. Our hypothesis is strengthened by a patient withsomatic mosaicism for an NF1 microdeletion who had rapid onset of der mal neurofibromas in her early 20s. Therefore the clinical manifestationsof the mosaic individual were ameliorated compared to those of thegermline NF1 microdeletion patients a result predicted by our hypothesis. Currently we are investigating 5 functional genes within the 700 kb criticalregion as candidates for the NPL locus. Our data implicate for the first timea locus that functions to modify neurofibromagenesis in humans. ,2001
1505, Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF 1) is one of the most common inherited disorders. The NF1 gene mapped to chromosome 17q11.2 spans approximately350 kb of genomic DNA and contains 60 exons. The condition appears tobe fully penetrant but has highly variable expression. For the patients onlyidentification of the pathogenic germline mutation allows for presympto matic and/or prenatal testing in offspring. However mutation detection inthe NF1 gene is laborious and complex due to the size of the gene theexistence of pseudogenes and the lack of mutational hotspots. Since thevast majority of pathogenic lesions in NF1 patients lead to truncated pro tein the protein truncation test (PTT) is one of the most widely used muta tion detection technique. Recently an alternative strategy has been devel oped for the detection of truncating mutations in large genes. This methodexploits the high efficiency of homologous recombination in yeast to fusethe test sequence in frame to a reporter gene. The method permits theanalysis of a large number of samples in a minimum of steps and simpli fies sequencing by the separation of wild type and mutant alleles. We haveadapted this method for the analysis of the NF1 gene in 10 fragments. Byanalysing 13 different mutations we have shown that the sensitivity of thetest is comparable to that of the PTT. Further we have demonstrated thatthe use of the translation inhibitor puromycin increases the sensitivity of thetest due to reduction of nonsense mediated mRNA decay. Thus this assayoffers a rapid and reliable alternative method for genetic diagnosis in NF1patients. ,2001
1506,Severe mental retardation is found in 0.5% of the newborn population androughly 2/3 of these cases are due to monogenic or chromosomal disor ders. In 1/3 of the affected males X chromosomal gene defects areinvolved and cryptic subtelomeric or interstitial deletions may be an equal ly important cause of mental retardation. In an attempt to study X linkedmental retardation in a systematic manner we have set out to collect andcharacterize 24 mentally retarded patients with balanced X autosometranslocations. By employing FISH probes from a near complete X chro mosomal YAC contig (manuscript in prep.) all but two of the X chromoso mal breakpoints could be mapped to an interval of 500 kb or less. Formany of these gene identification is in progress. Here we report on twopatients a familial inv(Xp22.2 q28) in a boy and a de novot(X 8)(p11.2 p22.3) in a girl. Each of the three X chromosomal breakpointswas found to disrupt an interesting candidate gene. Mutation analysis inthe >200 unrelated patients of the European MRX consortium is inprogress. ,2001
1507,The Aarskog syndrome (AS MIM #305400) is an X linked condition char acterized by facial genital and skeletal anomalies. It is caused by muta tions in the FGD1 gene located in Xp11.21. Since many X linked mentalretardation (XLMR) conditions localize to a broad region encompassingXp11.2 we began a mutational analysis of XLMR families linked to Xp11.2as well as males from small unstudied XLMR families. In one affectedmale in the families a shift in exon 4 of FGD1 was detected by SSCP. Sequence analysis revealed a C1665T change which gave rise to anamino acid substitution P312L. The base change was confirmed by StyIdigestion of the altered allele. Analysis of the family indicated the C1665Talteration segregated with XLMR in the family. The C1665T alteration wasnot detected in 250 normal X chromosomes. The phenotype of the affect ed males is non syndromic. Except for a tendency towards short stature (ator below the 10 %tile) the affected males did not exhibit any of the hall mark features of AS widow s peak prominent forehead hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures joint hyperextensibility shawl scrotum or foot deformations . Furthermore all three males hadsevere MR that is not a feature of AS. Utilization of several programs forsecondary sequence analysis revealed that the substitution of a leucine forproline at position 312 appears to lengthen a coil region two fold by remov ing a beta turn. FGD1 is now like RSK2 and MECP2 in that mutations in itgive rise to both syndromic and nonsyndromic XLMR conditions. ,2001
1508,Papillon Lef vre syndrome (PLS) is a rare autosomal recessive conditioncharacterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe periodontitis thatresults in premature tooth loss. We recently identified the gene that ismutated in this condition (Toomes et al. Nat. Genet. 23 421 424 1999).This gene CTSC encodes the oligomeric lysosomal protease cathepsin C(also known as dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I) which plays an essential rolein the activation of granule serine proteases expressed in bone marrow derived effector cells of both myeloid and lymphoid series. These serineproteases are implicated in a wide variety of immune and inflammatoryprocesses and a lack of functional CTSC in PLS may be associated with areduced host response against bacteria in dental plaque. We have per formed mutation analyses on 17 PLS families and identified 20 mutations. Affected individuals in two of the families were compound heterozygotesand one of these two families had three different mutations. Of the genet ic changes 13 were misense mutations 3 were nonsense mutations 2splice site mutations 1 frameshift insertion and 1 frameshift deletion. There was no obvious correlation with the phenotype. In 5 families thatwere available for further analysis a functional assay showed almost totalloss of CTSC activity in PLS patients and reduced activity in obligate car riers. ,2001
1509,Keratolytic winter erythema (KWE) is an autosomal dominant disorder ofunknown etiology characterized by cyclical erythema hyperkeratosis aswell as recurrent and intermittent peeling of the palms and soles especiallyduring winter. KWE has been localized to chromosome 8p22 23 and hap lotype analysis in South African families placed the candidate gene in a6cM interval between D8S550 and D8S552. Positional candidates in the6cM region were identified through cDNA direct selection exon trappingand database searches. This region contains several known genes includ ing cathepsin B (CTSB). This gene is a compelling candidate since anautosomal recessive disorder characterized by palmoplantar hyperkerato sis and periodontitis is caused by mutations in the cathepsin C gene(CTSC) on 11q14. CTSB mutation analysis was done on genomic DNAand by RT PCR on patient lymphocytes. Several polymorphisms wereidentified in the coding region including two amino acid substitution muta tions V26L and S53G and one synonymous mutation T140T (nt420C? A). Several additional polymorphisms were observed in the introns. Each of the variant alleles in the coding region was found in both affectedand unaffected individuals and therefore CTSB is unlikely to be the KWEgene. The CTSB promoter region is presently being examined for func tionally significant mutations. ,2001
1510,Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) is an autosomal dominant genoder matosis characterized by persistent plaque like or generalized hyperker atosis and transient red patches of variable size shape and location. Recently we demonstrated that EKV is caused by mutations in GJB3encoding the gap junction protein connexin 31 (Cx31) on 1p35.1. Howev er two thirds of all families had no detectable mutations in GJB3 or the co localized connexin genes GJB5 and GJA4 despite convincing evidence forlocus homogeneity. We report here the identification of 4 distinct mutationsin another connexin gene GJB4 (Cx30.3) at this cluster in 4 extended EKVfamilies and a sporadic case. All heterozygous missense mutations com pletely co segregated with the disease and altered highly conservedresidues. One of them G12D lies in the N terminus and may interfere withthe gating polarity of Cx channels. Other mutations (T85P F137L F189Y)affected the transmembrane domains of Cx30.3 thus potentially hinderingregulation of voltage gating and kinetics of channel closure. All GJB4 muta tions resulted in localized hyperkeratosis while identical mutations inGJB3 (G12D and F137L) were associated with severe generalized skininvolvement. Nevertheless we observed considerable intrafamilial vari ability in 2 multiplex families suggesting the influence of other genetic andenvironmental factors. Sequence analysis further revealed 3 missensesubstitutions and a common 4 bp frameshift deletion within the GJB4 cod ing region which might represent either non consequential polymorphismsor recessive mutations and as such could contribute to the phenotype. Our results demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in EKV and emphasize thatintercellular communication mediated by Cx31 and Cx30.3 is crucial forepidermal differentiation. ,2001
1511,Inherited cataract is a genetically heterogeneous lens disease that mostoften presents as a congenital autosomal dominant Mendelian trait show ing considerable inter and intrafamilial clinical variation and high pene trance. CZP1 autosomal dominant zonular pulverulent cataract wasmapped to chromosome 1.

1512,Mutations in the connexin 26 (Cx 26) gene account for 20 30% of all prelin gual deafness in many populations. Certain mutations such as 35delG 167delT and 235delC are rather frequent in probands of Western Euro pean Ashkenazi Jewish and Oriental population respectively. Screeningfor Cx 26 mutations in a sample of 136 deaf Mongolian probands yieldedonly three 35delG heterozygotes. Two probands were homozygous for the235delC mutation and three additional heterozygotes were detected 2 forthe 235delC mutation and one for a novel 2 bp deletion at nt 100. Thus theoverall frequency of Cx 26 deafness is quite low ranging from 1.5% to5.8% if all of the apparent heterozygotes are cryptic homozygotes. A largenumber of deaf probands carried the V27I substitution 22% being het erozygous and 4.4% being homozygous for this change. Interestingly when present the E114G substitution was always noted in cis with the V27Ibackground in 11.6% of the deaf probands. Although this sequencechange was observed in the normal population its high frequency in thedeaf probands as well as homozygosity for both polymorphisms in a deafindividual has prompted us to perform in vitro functional analysis toaddress its clinical relevance. The low frequency of Cx 26 mutations in apopulation where assortative mating amongst the deaf is rare supports thehypothesis that marriages amongst the deaf may affect the frequency ofCx 26 deafness in certain populations. ,2001
1513,Partial or complete hearing loss is often of congenital origin. Among isolat ed forms of deafness the autosomal recessive forms (DFNB) are marked ly prevalent (80%). It is estimated that about one hundred different genesare involved in the non syndromic form of deafness. Among those genes one particular Ã¢\x80\x94 GJB2 is responsible for a high proportion of cases. Muta tions in GJB2 gene were observed in 50% of families affected with pro found prelingual autosomal recessive deafness in many European coun tries. Herein we report analysis of 104 unrelated Polish patients with pro found prelingual deafness for mutation in GJB2 gene. Mutations werefound in 43/104 (41%) of subjects. Among mutated alleles 35delG wasprevalent and present in 90% ones. In 9 alleles mutations different than35delG were found M34T Q47X R184P and 313del14 (found in 6patients). The subsequent results proved mutations in GJB2 gene areresponsible to high degree for hereditary non syndromic deafness inPoland with strong prevalence of 35delG. We have also found high carrierfrequency (1/50) for 35delG mutation in Polish population. ,2001
1514,Mutations in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) are responsible for the majorityof nonsyndromic recessive deafness in many world populations and arealso a major cause of apparently sporadic congenital deafness. Threemutations are particularly common in specific populations 35delG in Cau casoids 167delT in Ashkenazi Jews and 235delC in Orientals. GJB2mutations are usually associated with prelingual hearing loss though388 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disordersseverity may range from mild to profound even within the same family. We had the opportunity to examine a sibship composed of four sisters two ofthem (20 and 17 years old) with prelingual sensorineural deafness and theother two (18 and 16 years old)with normal speech development and mod erate sensorineural hearing loss which was detected only a few years ago. Mutation analysis of the GJB2 gene revealed that all four girls werehomozygous for the 35delG mutation while both parents were heterozy gotes. Though this may be a rare finding screening programs for geneticdeafness in newborns should consider the possibility that the deaf pheno type associated with mutations in the connexin 26 gene may not developuntil later in life. ,2001
1515,Hearing impairment affects 1/1000 children and at least 50% of thesecases are inherited. The inherited forms of deafness are classified in syn dromic (30%) and non syndromic deafness (70%). Among the non syn dromic cases the major proportion is due to autosomal recessive inheri tance (70%) 20% of the cases are due to autosomal dominant inheritance 5% are X linked and mitochondrial inheritance is responsible for about 1%.To date 30 loci (DFNB1 to DFNB30) have been described for autosomalrecessive inheritance. The DFNB1 locus accounts for approximately 80%of autosomal recessive deafness in Mediterranean families due to muta tions in the GJB2 gene. The GJB2 gene encodes the gap junction proteinconnexin 26 and except the major 35delG mutation more than 60sequence alterations have been reported so far. This study presents theanalysis of 18 families for the presence of GJB2 mutations other than the35delG mutation. All probands were either heterozygotes or negative forthe 35delG mutation. Sequencing of these patients revealed 2 novel muta tions 509del14 and 486insT (both in heterozygosity with the 35delG). Acommon novel polymorphism 681+84C>T was also detected in 11patients. The previously reported K224Q mutation was identified as thesole mutation in one patient. The L90P mutation was identified in 2 patientsand the W24X mutation in another 2 patients (all in heterozygosity with the35delG). The characterization of the spectrum of the GJB2 mutations inGreek patients with non syndromic sensorineural recessive deafness willreveal the molecular basis of the disease and provide the necessary infor mation for genetic counseling. ,2001
1516,Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disorders is group of clinicaly and geneticalyheterogeneus inherited peripheral neuropathies. The most common type isby far the autosomal dominant CMT1A caused by a 1 5 Mb duplication in17p11.2 12 comprising the PMP22 gene. CMT type X is the second mostcommon type of CMT. This type is inherited as a gonosomal dominant trait. Hemizygous males are earlier and more severly afected then the het erozygous females. No male to male transmision can be found in theCMTX pedigrees. Connexin 32 mutations are the most common cause ofCMTX. We report a Czech family with a severe type of CMT 1 disease. Adisorder with gait disturbancies moderate footdrop and distal muscleweakness and foot deformities is present in at least 3 generations in thisfamily. EMG showed signs of demyelination confirming type 1 of CMT dis ease. After exclusion of the CMT1A duplication at 17p we directlysequenced the whole coding region of connexin 32 gene (Cx32). A T to Ctransition at nucleotide 193 causing a tyrosine to histidine aminoacid change in the first extracelular domain of the Cx32 protein was found in themother and son of this family. This mutation was not yet reported. Detailedclinical and electrophysiological data from this two mutation carrier will bepresented. Supported by IGA MH CR and IP Nr. 111300003 ,2001
1517,The GJB2 gene codes for the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx 26).Mutations in this gene may cause autosomal recessive or dominant non syndromic hearing loss.

1519,Congenital SNHL has an incidence in children of 1 2/1000 for bilateralsevere to profound losses (>50 dB) and up to 4/1000 if mild/moderate andunilateral loss are included. Up to 60% of congenital SNHL can be attrib Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 389uted to genetic causes. Of those autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss accounts for approximately 80% and mutations in the con nexin 26 (GJB2) gene are the most common known cause. We have ana lyzed a total of 152 unrelated families /patients with congenital SNHL either recessive or sporadic from a large pediatrics medical center. Mostprobands were age 1 week to 18 years had no obvious etiology for thecongenital SNHL and were tested using a highly sensitive unambiguousthree step PCR based sequencing assay to detect all mutations in theentire coding region of Cx26 gene. Of the 304 unrelated Cx26 alleles ana lyzed from 152 probands 39% (60/152) had Cx26 mutations 25 patientswith biallelic mutations (9 homozygotes and 16 compound heterozygotes) and 35 with a single mutation. Four different homozygous mutations werefound 35delG/35delG (3.4%) M34T/M34T (1.4%) 167delT/167delT(0.7%) and V37I/V37I (0.7%). Six different compound heterozygous muta tions were detected 35delG/167delT (3.4%) 35delG/M34T (2.7%) 35delG/G12V (1.4%) 35delG/E47X (1.4%) 35delG/N206S (1.4%) T8M/V153I (0.7%). Overall mutations detected in this study are the 11 pre viously reported in the literature 35delG 167delT E47X M34T G12V V37I L90P V84L R127H R143W and 310del14 and the 3 novel muta tions newly reported here N206S T8M and E129K. None of these newmutations were found in 100 normal controls. Hearing loss in thesepatients with biallelic Cx26 mutations ranged from unilateral high frequen cy to bilateral profound except those with homozygous or compound het erozygous for M34T. These patients had mild hearing loss. ,2001
1520,The GJB2 gene encodes the connexin 26 (Cx26) component of gap junc tions. Mutations in this gene have been found to be responsible for half ofthe severe to profound autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness(NSRD). One single mutation 35delG has been shown to be the mostprevalent mutation in this gene and one of the most frequent mutationsidentified so far. The present study is based in a preliminary analysis of theportuguese population previously reported where 10 NSRD families anda sample of normal hearing individuals were screened for the 35delGmutation. Analysis of the entire coding region was carried out in both theheterozygous and 35delG negative families revealing the presence in oneof the families of a novel splicing mutation IVS1 23G T in compound het erozygosity with M34T mutation. In the negative cases or those presentinga single coding sequence mutation we have searched for mutations in theCx26 non coding exon (exon 1) and flanking donor splicing site. A similarstudy has now been carried out in a total of 52 NSRD families. The resultsobtained will be presented and discussed in comparison with other euro pean populations. ,2001
1521,50% of early onset deafness cases are genetic and 50% of the recessivecase are due to mutations in the GJB2 gene. The TMPRSS3 geneencodes a novel transmembrane serine protease. It is mutated in the fam ilies used to describe both the DFNB10 and DFNB8 loci on chromosome21 (Nat. Genet. Jan01). To determine if TMPRSS3 mutations are an impor tant contributor to the etiology of childhood deafness we performed SSCPscreening of all 13 exons and intron exon junctions and sequencing ofDNAs of non syndromic recessive deaf patients negative for GJB2 genemutations. A total of 391 such unrelated patients (100 from Spain 198 fromItaly and 93 from Greece) were enrolled in the study. The analysis has sofar been completed in DNA samples from 293 patients. Several commonexonic polymorphisms were found (V53I G111S V151V I253V) as well asa series of intronic changes. In only 2 patients there were changes that arelikely to be associated with the phenotype. A deletion of nucleotide 207C inexon 4 has been found in homozygosity in one Spanish patient resulting ina truncation of the TMPRSS3 protein after the Transmembrane Domain. In another Spanish patient an amino acid substitution (A426T) has beenidentified in heterozygosity in an exon coding for the protease domain. A426 is well conserved in serine proteases. These two changes have notbeen found in any other patient of our sample. These results indicate thatmutations in TMPRSS3 do not substantially contribute to the non syn dromic deafness in the Caucasian population. ,2001

This phenotype clearly overlaps with the features ofthe Shah Waardenburg syndrome comprising sensorineural deafness hypopigmentation of skin hair and irides and HSCR. We thereforescreened DNA of the index patient of the ABCD syndrome family for muta tions in the endotheline B receptor (EDNRB) gene a gene known to beinvolved in Shah Waardenburg syndrome. A homozygous nonsense muta tion in exon 3 (Arg201stop) of the EDNRB gene was found. This meansthat ABCD syndrome is not a separate entity but a severe expression ofShah Waardenburg syndrome. ,2001

1525,Usher syndrome type II is an autosomal recessive disorder characterizedby stable hearing impairment from childhood and progressive retinitis pig mentosa. Mutations in the USH2A gene located on 1q41 were shown tobe responsible for Usher syndrome type II. All reported mutations are scat tered throughout the gene and are small point mutations causing nonsense(11) or missense (10) changes or splice site changes (1) or small insertions(3) or deletions (6) causing frameshift mutations. One of these mutations 2299delG occurs at high frequency among Usher 2A patients. Here wereport a Spanish family with Usher 2A syndrome and a large deletion of theUSH2A gene. It is the first gross deletion of the USH2A gene encompass ing exons 9 to 14. Intragenic deletion was initially suspected as a cause ofthe disease in the two affected siblings because a non successful PCRamplification of the USH2A exon 13 containing the frequent 2299delGmutation. This simple PCR based approach was further used to localizethe approximate breakpoints of the deleted region. Our two patients areunder 20 years old and have a clinical picture typical of Usher type II. Although it is difficult to predict the phenotypic consequences of theseverely truncated USH2A gene the deletion might bring about other phe notypic changes with older age. ,2001
1526, uni muenchen.deX linked congenital stationary night blindness (XLCSNB) is characterizedby impaired scotopic vision with associated ocular symptoms like myopia hyperopia nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. Genetic mapping in fam ilies with XLCSNB revealed two different loci on the proximal short arm ofthe X chromosome. These two genetic subtypes can also be distinguishedon the basis of ERG responses and psychophysical testing in a complete(CSNB1 ) and an incomplete form ( CSNB2 ). Recently we have been shown that CSNB2 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1F gene (Strom et al. Nature Genetics 1998). The CSNB1 locus has been mapped to a 5 cM link age interval in Xp11.4. Construction and analysis of a contig between themarkers DXS993 and DXS228 led to the identification of a novel gene that is mutated in CSNB1 patients. It is partially deleted in three families and mutation analysis in further 22 families detected another 14 different muta tions. The gene designated NYX codes for a 481 amino acid protein (nyc talopin) and is expressed at low levels in various tissues including retina brain testis and muscle. The predicted polypeptide is a GPI anchoredextracellular protein with 11 typical and two cysteine rich leucine richrepeats (LRRs). This motif is important for protein protein interactions andmembers of the LRR superfamily are involved in cell adhesion and axonguidance. Currently antibodies against NYX are raised to determine theprecise localization within the retinal tissues and to identify interacting pro teins. ,2001
1527, muenchen.deRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) describes a group of diseases characterized byprogressive retinal degeneration. X linked forms (xlRP) account for 15 %of all hereditary RP cases and result in particulary severe phenotypes. Linkage data predict 60 80 % of all xlRP cases to be associated with theRP3 and 10 20 % with the RP2 locus. The recent identification of a novel3Ã¢\x80\x98terminal RPGR exon (ORF15) which harbours a mutational hotspotraised the question of the total proportion of RPGR mutations in patientswith xlRP. Mutation analysis of the novel RPGR exon which extends exon15 for 1554 nucleotides and codes for a glutamic acid rich domain turnedout to be technically challenging because of an extremely purine rich andhighly repetitive stretch of 800 bp. Several strategies were persued toobtain reliable sequences including subcloning of PCR products solidphase or direct sequencing of PCR products. Good results were obtainedwith sequencing a 1 6 kb fragment containing the purine rich region. Sev eral additives had to be used for PCR amplification and sequencing.

1528,"Branchio oto renal syndrome (BOR) is a human developmental disordercharacterized by hearing loss preauricular pits structural defects of theexternal middle and/or inner ear and renal anomalies. It is inherited as anautosomal dominant pattern and affect at least 2% of profoundly deaf chil dren and have estimated prevalence of 1 in 40 000. The phenotypicexpression of the branchial arch as well as audiologic and renal develop ment can be quite variable even within the same family. The first BORgene has been localized to chromosome 8q13 and has been shown to becaused by mutations in the EYA1 gene. Recently a second genetic locus(BGS2) associated with BOR syndrome has been localized to chromo some 1q. We have performed mutation analysis on more than sixty BORfamilies by heteroduplex followed by sequence analysis of sixteen EYA1exons. To date using this approach we have identified fourteen novelmutations. About 65% of our large data set of BOR families do not showmutations in the EYA1 gene. This further complicates the issue and sug gests that either most of the mutations lie in the untranslated region orseveral genes are involved in the branchiogenic disorder. Genetic linkageanalysis was performed on several multigenerational BOR type familieswith 8q and 1q markers to explore the possibility of further genetic hetero geneity. Our current results indicate that two large BOR type families didnot show linkage with 8q and 1q markers suggesting the involvement ofthird gene. A genome wide search is being performed for the localizationof third locus. Also a candidate gene analysis is underway to identifygenes in the critical region of BGS2 locus on chromosome 1q. The pres ent results together with mutation screening and genetic linkage study demonstrate further genetic heterogeneity. These results provide the basisfor a molecular genetic testing that will help the clinical evaluation andgenetic counseling of members of BOR families. Further characterizationof EYA1 mutation and identification of other BOR genes will significantlyhelp in defining the spectrum of defects associated with branchial andhearing anomalies. Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 391P1482. A Novel Nonsense Mutation in the RP1 Gene Causing Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa in a LithuanianFamily D. Kasperaviciute1 D. Ambrasiene1 J. V. Arciuliene2 V. Kucinskas1 1Human Genetics Center Vilnius University Vilnius Lithuania 2Laborato ry of Visual Rehabilitation Kaunas Medical University Kaunas L', 'Retinitis pigmentosa represents a genetically heterogeneous group of dis orders characterised by night blindness visual field loss and retinal pig mentary changes. Mutations in the RP1 gene have recently been shown toaccount for 4 Ã¢\x80\x94 7 % autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP)cases. Ten different mutations have been reported so far they seem tocluster in the 5 end of exon 4. The purpose of this study was to determinemutations in RP1 responsible for adRP in Lithuanian families. 22 patientsfrom unrelated adRP families were screened for mutations in a segment ofthe RP1 gene from nucleotide 1038 to 1720 using heteroduplex analysisand single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencingrevealed a nonsense mutation K792X (c.2374A>T) in one patient. Thisnovel mutant allele if expressed would encode a severely truncated RP1protein lacking approximately 63 % of its original length. All affected mem bers of the family available for investigation had this mutation. The condi tion has a late onset at 40 45 years of age and slow progression. We alsofound this mutation in 3 asymptomatic subjects of the same family underthe age of 18. Based on this study mutations in the RP1 gene appear tocause 4 % of adRP cases in Lithuania. That frequency does not signifi cantly differ from frequency in other populations however mutations fre quent in other populations (R677X and 2280 2284del) were not found inLithuania. ",2001
1529,Several candidate genes involved in the visual transduction cascade havebeen studied in autosomal recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa (ARRP)Spanishfamilies. Disease causing mutations habe been only identified in the betasubunit of the rod cGMP phosphodiesterase gene and in the ATP bindingcassette receptor gene. They account respectively for 8% and 6% of Span ish ARRP families. These data indicates that other than these genes maybe involved in the remaining families emphasising the genetic hetero geneity of the disease and reinforcing the hypothesis that in ARRP there isno a major gene but several genes may account individually for a smallnumber of cases. A recent report(1) indicates that a missense mutation(Cys 759Phe) in the gene responsible of Usher syndrome type II (USH2Agene) is present in 4 5% of patients from North America with non syn dromic ARRP with a frequency of this allele of 0.027. We have analized thepresence of this mutation in a set of ARRP Spanish families from all overthe country that were collected by members of the Spanish MulticentricGroup fro the Study of RP. The Cys759Phe mutation was found in het erozygous form in 4 out of 130 unrelated patients (allelic frequency 0.015).This finding demonstrates the involvement of the USH2A locus in reces sive non syndromic RP in Spanish poulation. As previously described (1)this mutation was found to be always associated with an isocoding changeat codon His772 (CAT CAC). ,2001
1530,Purpose. To investigate mutations of TGFBI (ÃÂ§IGH3 keratoepithelin) genein Japanese patients with autosomal dominant corneal dystrophies (CD).Methods. After an appropriate informed consent was obtained from eachsubject genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 159patients and 22 unaffected relatives from 120 families with granular CD(GCD) lattice CD (LCD) or Reis B cklers CD (RBCD). Fifty normal vol unteers served as controls. Each exon was amplified by polymerase chainreaction and directly sequenced. Results. Six different heterozygous mis sense mutations were detected in codons R124 L518 L527 and R555 ofthe TGFBI gene in 147 patients from 116 families. Among 89 families withGCD Avellino CD (ACD) with R124H mutation was detected in 94% and Groenouw type I with R555W mutation in 6% therefore in Japan ACDhas been referred as GCD. Among 27 families with LCD LCD type I (LCDI)with R124C mutation was detected in 48% atypical LCDI with L518Pmutation was in one family (3.7%) and LCD with deep stromal opacities(type IV) with L527R mutation was in 33%. No mutation was found in 4families with LCD. Among 4 families with RBCD a R555Q mutation wasdetected in 6 patients. Conclusions. We conclude that codons R124 andR555 of the TGFBI gene are also hot spots in Japanese patients with GCD LCD and RBCD where 94.4% of GCD was ACD with R124H mutation andthe remaining few percents (3.7%) were Groenouw I with R555W mutation. The L527R is the second common mutation in Japanese LCD. ,2001
1531,Macular corneal dystrophy type I (MCD) is an autosomal recessive inheri tance disorder which is caused by deficient enzyme activity of GlcNAc 6 sulfotransferase (GlcNAc6ST) a sulfotransferase needed in synthesizingcorneal keratan sulfate. This disease manifests as corneal opacity leadingsevere visual impairment. Previous linkage study revealed that MCD ismapped to chromosome on 16q21. The carbohydrate sulfotransferasegene (CHST5) encoding intestine GlcNAc6ST has cloned on 16q21 assame chromosomal location as MCD. We screened CHST5 in ninepatients with MCD and ninety five unrelated healthy controls. GenomicDNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes and 1658 bp genomic frag ment of CHST5 amplified by PCR was directly sequenced. No responsiblemutations which cosegregate with disease were found in CHST5 gene. Two polymorphisms of R163Q and T297M were identified. The R163Q wasobserved significantly higher frequency (p<<0.001) in the patients than thatin the controls. The significant linkage disequilibirium of R163Q polymor phism indicates that the most critical gene should be located very near toCHST5. Recently Akama et al. reported a couple mutations in cornea spe cific GlcNAc6ST (CHST6) in MCD patients. CHST6 is located approxi mately 30kb downstream of nan,2001
1532,To date the cause of more than 60 Mendelian syndromic and non syn dromic retinal dystrophies is still unknown. Towards the goal to identifiynovel candidates for retinal disease genes we are performing systematicexpression profiling of established UniGene EST clusters showing a highlevel of representation in retinal cDNA libraries. Cluster Hs.60473 is anassembly of two retina 3 read ESTs and was confirmed to be exclusivelyexpressed in retinal tissue by RT PCR and Northern blot analysis. Thescreening of retinal cDNA libraries and 5 RACE experiments yielded morethan 15 overlapping cDNA fragments that were assembled into a 1190 bpfull length cDNA containing an ORF of 196 amino acids termed C7orf9.Analysis of the deduced protein sequence revealed the presence of twoconserved RFamide related peptides. RFamides are a family of smallbioreactive peptides known to be expressed in vertebrate and invertebratenervous systems including the sensory retina. The C7orf9 gene containsthree exons localized to the D7S2493 D7S529 interval on chromosome7p15 p21 a region harbouring the gene for dominant cystoid macular dys trophy (CYMD). Due to its chromosomal location and retina specificexpression C7orf9 represents an excellent candidate for the CYMD gene. A possible involvement of C7orf9 in disease is currently being assessed bymutation analysis in affected patients of a large Dutch CYMD family previ ously linked to chromosome 7p. ,2001
1533,X linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS OMIM *312700) is a progressivehereditary retinopathy consisting of intraretinal splitting due to degenera tion. The RS gene resposible for the disease is located on Xp22.2 Ã¢\x80\x9422.1and has 6 exons. The encoded 224 amino acid protein is exclusivelyexpressed in retina and contains a highly conserved motif implicated incell cell interaction and possibly active in cell adhesion processes. Weanalysed the entire coding region of RS gene by PCR amplification fol lowed by direct sequencing (ABIprism 310 Perkin Elmer) in 3 unrelatedSpanish families affected with juvenile retinoschisis. Complete ophthalmo logical studies and Electroretinograms were recorded according to thestandard testing protocols. We detected three missense changes Gln154Arg Arg 213Gln and Glu215Gln. There was co segregation with the disease within each family. The mutations were located in exons 5 and 6emphasizing the critical functional significance of the discoidin domain ofthe XLRS1 protein. The identification of the responsible mutations for the disease coupled with complete familiar analysis allowed us to detect carri er women and therefore provide better genetic counselling in these fami lies. ,2001
1534, wuerzburg.deX linked juvenile retinoschisis (RS) is an early onset vitreoretinal disordercharacterized by schisis or splitting of the nerve fiber and ganglion celllayers of the retina. RS is clinically variable with symptoms ranging fromslightly reduced visual acuity to more significant complications such as reti nal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage. The gene underlying RS wasidentified by positional cloning and is composed of 6 exons encoding a 224amino acid precursor protein termed retinoschisin with a 23 amino acidhydrophobic leader sequence. Most of the protein consists of a discoidin like domain which is common to a family of proteins implicated in celladhesion. By immunohistochemistry we show that retinoschisin is exclu sively present in the membrane fraction of retinal tissue homogenates. Moreover retinoschisin antibodies specifically label rod and cone photore ceptors and most bipolar cells. The protein appears to be active as a disul fide linked oligomeric complex. To further analyze the role of retinoschisinin retinal cell biology we have generated a knock out mouse by targetingexon 3 of the murine Rs1h gene resulting in a true null allele. In addition a lacZ reporter was introduced in frame and has allowed us to establishthe developmental pattern of gene expression thus linking absent Rsh1transcription to early retinal pathology. Our current model assumes that theretinoschisin complex binds to the surface of photoreceptors and bipolarcells where it may function as a cellular adhesion protein stabilizing the cel lular organization of the retina. ,2001
1535, muenchen.deOptic atrophy type1 (OPA1) is a dominantly inherited optic neuropathy withan onset in early childhood and is characterized by progressive loss ofvisual acuity. The predominant locus for the disease has been localized to3q28 q29 a second locus has been mapped to chromosome 18q12.2 q12.3. Symptoms similar to those found in Leber hereditary optic neu ropathy LHON are suggestive of a mitochondrial disease. Recently theOPA1 gene on 3q28 has been identified as a dynamin related GTPasehomologous to the yeast Mgm1 gene which encodes a mitochondrial pro tein that plays a role for the distribution and morphology of mitochondria. We established the gene structure of the human Mgm1 homologue usingthe working draft sequence available from the public sequencing centres. Eight patients from non related families were screened for mutations byamplifying and sequencing all 28 coding exons. Only in a single patient wedetected a missense mutation 377A>C which changes an asparagine toan alanine. This mutation could not be found in 100 control chromosomes. A dosis Southern blot analysis revealed deletions in at least two morepatients suggesting haploinsufficiency as the causative disease mecha nism. The large number of exons the existence of exon deletions which escape nonquantitative PCR detection and non allelic heterogeneity posedifficulties to the molecular diagnosis of patients with this disorder. ,2001
1536,Two distinct phenotypes aniridia and primary open angle glaucoma(POAG) segregate within a large Tasmanian pedigree. We have identifieda novel PAX6 mutation associated with highly variable phenotype withinone branch of this pedigree and wished to investigate its role (if any) in rel atives with POAG. Eleven individuals in the aniridia branch of the pedigreewere subjected to detailed phenotypic analysis including anterior segmentand fundus photography automated perimetry and IOP measurement. Mutation analysis revealed a novel PAX6 1410delC mutation in 9 affectedindividuals not present in 9 unaffected relatives or spouses. One familymember believed to be mildly affected by the family with visual acuity 6/9and 6/7.5 was found not to carry the mutation. Clinical features in muta tion carriers ranged from total aniridia to minimal anterior segment findings. Other findings included keratitis cataract glaucoma optic disc anomaliesand foveal hypoplasia. POAG individuals in two additional branches of theextended pedigree had IOP measured Humphrey visual fields and stereodisc photographs taken and clinical history documented. The PAX6 muta tion was not detected in 7 individuals with POAG. Other genetic or envi ronmental factors involved in anterior segment development may interactwith the PAX6 gene to determine the severity of the phenotype in theaniridia branch and may also account for the slightly reduced vision in anon mutation carrier. Optic nerve anomalies were particularly common and the same genes may modify the aniridia phenotype as well as con tribute to POAG. ,2001
1537,We describe 9 members of a consanguineous Irish traveller family withsevere visual impairment due to anophthalmia microphthalmia or colobo matous microphthalmia. Two members have complete bilateral anoph thalmia five had unilateral anophthalmia and contralateral colobomatousmicrophthalmia and two had microphthalmia. There was no history ofchemical exposure no other associated malformations and chromosomalanalysis in two affected individuals was normal. There is pseudodominantinheritance in one family with an affected son born to an affected father ina consanguineous marriage. Only a small number of families with autoso mal recessive colobomatous micro/anophthalmia have been describedbefore. Several reports have been of families with a consistent expressionof exclusively bilateral anophthalmia in homozygotes in contrast to thefamily we describe with a more varied expression in homozygotes. This isthe first description of this condition in the Irish traveller population andrepresents a further disease allele for this population. A previously known14q32 locus for autosomal recessive anophthalmia and the recentlydescribed CHX10 gene on chromosome 14 known to cause autosomalrecessive anophthalmia have been excluded in this family suggesting atleast a third locus for this condition. Homozygosity mapping for autosomalrecessive anophthalmia is currently under way. ,2001
1538, u.ac.jpTwo Thai families with Norrie disease (ND) including 10 affected malesPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 393and one manifesting female in three generations are described. All affect ed males in each family had severely defective eye development with com plete loss of vision. In addition three male patients (one from a family 1and two from the other family) suffered from epilepsy and one female car rier from one family manifested blindness with phthisis bulbi in her righteye. Mutation analysis of the ND gene (NDP) revealed two different novelmissense mutations (L16P and S75P) that co segregated with ND in eachfamily suggesting that the newly appearing proline at codon 16 or codon75 alters the conformation of the ND protein and contributes to the severephenotype of ND in each family. It has been suggested that epilepticseizures or growth retardation that is associated with ND is the conse quence of loss of contiguous genes because most such patients had dele tions extending beyond the Norrie locus. Our finding that the three affect ed males in the two families with the missense mutations have epilepsydoes not support a contiguous gene effect but favor the pleiotropism ofNDP as far as at least the epileptic manifestation is concerned. The femalecarrier with unilateral blindness may be due to non random X inactivation. ,2001
1539,INTRODUCTION Mutations in the Myocilin gene account for 3% of pri mary open angle glaucoma with the Gln368STOP mutation being the mostfrequently observed. The next most frequently identified mutation to datein Australia is the Thr377Met mutation. We present detailed phenotypeanalysis in 4 glaucoma pedigrees with this mutation. METHODS Fourfamilies were identified with the Thr377Met mutation from over 2 000 glau coma samples from South Eastern Australia tested from the GIST project. Clinical notes visual fields and stereo disc photographs were obtained onall subjects. RESULTS All index cases had a positive family history ofglaucoma. One large family originated from the UK and 3 smaller familieswere of Greek or Macedonian extraction. The median age of diagnosis wasin the 4th decade and maximum recorded IOP was over 30mmHg in mostdiagnosed glaucoma cases. Half these cases required trabeculectomy. CONCLUSION The Thr377Met mutation has been identified in two ethnicsubgroups with a consistent glaucoma phenotype associated with elevat ed intraocular pressure with variable age of onset typically in early adult hood often requiring filtration surgery. ,2001
1540,Axenfeld Rieger (AR) malformations are characterized by aberration of theanterior chamber of the eye and are associated with early onset glaucoma. Mutation of the transcription factor PITX2 has been shown to underlie AR. Here we characterize a novel mutation of the PITX2 homeodomain. A V45Lmissense mutation of PITX2 found in a patient with AR malformation wasintroduced into the PITX2 cDNA by site directed mutagenesis. Recombi nant wildtype (wt) and mutant (mt) PITX2 proteins were expressed in COS 7 cells and subcellualr localization was examined by immunofluorescence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to compare theDNA binding abilities of wt and mt PITX2 proteins. Activation of a luciferasereporter gene was used to test the transactivation activity of wt and mtPITX2 proteins in HeLa cells. The V45L protein correctly localized to thecell nucleus but had a 2 to 7 fold decrease in DNA binding activity versuswt nan,2001
1541,Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/DMB) are X linked dis orders that result from heterogeneous mutations in the dystrophin gene. Several studies performed in groups of patients from different ethnic ori gins showed that the frequency of the DMD/DMB cases due to deletions ofone or more exons varies between 0.23 and 0.86. The remaining cases aredue to point mutations or duplications within the gene. DNA isolated fromperipheral blood lymphocytes of 51 patients with DMD/DMB from Chilewere analysed by multiplex PCR (Chamberlain and Beggs). Deletionswere detected in 24 patients (47%) 22 with a diagnostic of DMD and 2 with394 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian DisordersDMB phenotype. The deletions were mainly clustered in the central part of the gene (exons 43 52) in a 79 %. The proportion of deletions in ourDMD/DMB patients differ from those reported for European and NorthAmerican populations (55 65%) and is closer to the frequency of deletionsfound in the Mexican population (53 %). The status of the dystrophin pro tein was studied through Western blot in patients not showing deletions inthe dystrophin gene. Monoclonal antibodies directed to the amino rod andcarboxi domains of the dystrophin were used. A total of 8 patients showeda complete lack of dystrophin suggesting the presence of mutations lead ing into stop codons. Financed by Fundacion Andes CHILE ,2001
1542,Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are caused by mutations in thedystrophin gene. Large deletions and duplications in the dystrophin genein DMD and BMD are detected in about two thirds of patients. This enablesaccurate carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis in those families. Whensuch large mutations are absent carrier detection relies on linkage analy sis and determination of creatine kinase activities in female family mem bers. Still detection of small mutations is very important for optimal carrierdetection in all families. Previously used techniques for tracing microle sions focussed on exons in the two deletion hot spots of the dystrophingene. However microlesions do not cluster in hot spots. Therefore wedesigned a comprehensive DGGE based mutation scanning method ofthe dystrophin gene with a set of 95 DGGE amplicons covering all exonsof the dystrophin gene including intron/exon boundaries. To reduce theworkload we used multiplex combinations of up to 6 exons. The systemwas validated by confirming 24 previously detected point mutations. Wehave screened 48 DMD patients 34 BMD patients and 50 high risk carri ers. We identified 20 pathogenic mutations and 4 possible pathogenicmutations in the DMD group. In 34 BMD patients we found 4 pathogenicmutations and 2 possible pathogenic mutations. Reasons for the low muta tion yield may be missed deep intronic mutations inversions small dupli cations possible promoter mutations and wrong diagnosis. Especially inisolated BMD patients where dystrophin analysis of muscle biopsies wasnot possible misdiagnosis might play an important role. ,2001
1543,Starting from overlapping YACs we have previously reconstructed the full2.5 Mb human Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) gene in yeast andsubsequently set out to transfer it to murine ES cells. Given its Mb size wechose for yeast spheroplast / mammalian cell fusion. Of the several tens ofDMD gene positive clones two contained all DMD exons withoutdetectable gross mishaps in the gene. Transgenic mice containing thehuman DMD gene (hDMD) were generated and subjected to detailed phe notypic and expression analysis. RT PCR Western blot analysis andimmuno histochemical studies using human specific vs. human/mousecrossreacting antibodiess showed that the human DMD gene had theexpected tissue specific expression of the various dystrophin isoforms. Moreover the similar level of human and mouse muscle isoforms suggeststhat the transcription and translation levels are also properly regulated. Toanswer the question whether the product(s) of the full human DMD genecan functionally complement a murine DMD mutation the mice werecrossed with mdx mice. Phenotypical and immuno histochemical analysisshowed that the mdx phenotype was restored to normal. Finally analysisof global expression patterns using DNA chip and micro array technologywas used to investigate the differences in muscle samples of normal hDMD mdx and human DMD complemented mdx animals. We will pres ent data comparing normal and diseased mouse and human tissue whichshould give a wealth of novel insights into more global deleterious effectsof DMD mutations. These data should help to understand the phenotypicaldifferences of dystrophin deficiency in man and mouse and thus potential ly lead to secundary interventions to reduce disease severity in patients. ,2001
1544,According to the frame shift hypothesis Becker muscular dystrophy isassociated with in frame mutations in the dystrophin gene. The most fre quent type of mutations are intragenic deletions mainly clustered in tworegions distal (exons 45 53) and proximal (exons 3 13). BMD phenotype including skeletal myopathy and cardiac disorders shows considerableclinical diversity. Generally proximal deletions are associated with worseprognosis while in distal deletions BMD has typical benign clinical course. The aim of this study is to analyze genotype phenotype correlation in agroup of six BMD patients with deletions affecting proximal part of dys trophin gene encompassing exons 3 13. Dystrophin gene deletions weredetected by standard multiplex PCR method. Clinical evaluation includeddetail neurological and cardiological examination. Four patients had dele tions in the region from muscle promoter to exon 8 encoding for N termi nal distrophin domain. Early onset (9.4+/ 4.8 y.) and faster progression of disease characterized this group. For example one patient (del. of exons6 8) was wheelchair bound since age 30 with severe cardiomyopathy andanother (del. of exons 3 6) at age 15 y. had severe muscular dystrophy. Intwo patients single exon 13 missing was detected of dystrophin s roddomain. These patients had later presentation (16 20 y.) with moderatemuscular dystrophy at middle ages. Our study suggests that proximalgene deletions in BMD have various phenotypic effects depend on corre sponding domain of protein dystrophin. ,2001
1545,Purpose To correlate the electroretinogram(ERG)findings in patients withDuchenne/Becker muscular dystropy (D/BMD) with the genotype and aval uate the ERG findings in obligate carriers. Materials and Methods Fifteendeletion positive patients with DMD two deletion positive patients withBMD and six obligate carriers in two families having positive DMD historywere evaluated with DNA analysis ophtalmologic and ERG findings. Find ings No pathology was detectedin the ophthalmic examination of thepatients. In three out of 17 patients with D/BMD ERG was normal(in twopatients with DMD and in one patient with BMD).In 14 patients ERG waselectronegative in scotopic conditions. In these cases in photopic condi tions b wave was recorded subnormal whereas a wave being magnified. B/A amplitude ratio was less than 2 in all DMD cases except two cases withnormal ERG and in one patient with BMD. Mutational alterations observedin this three cases were exceptionally at 5 hot spot not like the others with in central region. In two patients Flicker ERG was found subnormal. In obli gate carriers ERG findings were normal. Conclusion ERG findings inD/BMD patients may show some correlations with molecularanalysis whereas it is not useful in obligate carriers. ,2001
1546,Duchene/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is an X linked recessivemuscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene located atXp21. BMD is a milder form of the disease which is characterized with lateronset and slower progression into adulthood. Most of the patients with thisform of the disease have in frame deletions of part(s) of the dystrophingene. Female carriers are rarely symptomatic and are mainly carriers ofDMD associated mutations. On the other hand only a few female carriersPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 395of BMD with symptomatic disease have been described so far. In this report we present a female carrier of a typical BMD with a manifesting dis ease. The patient is a 45 years old female who has two sons with a mildform of Becker muscular dystrophy. She presented with pseudohypertro phy of the calves mildly elevated serum CPK levels and myopathic elec tromyogram. DNA analysis using the multiplex PCR approach showed thatthe two sons have in frame deletion of exons 46 47 and 48. QuantitativePCR analysis using fluorescently labeled PCR products and automatedfragment analysis on ABIPrism 310 Genetic Analyzer confirmed that themother is also a carrier of this deletion. The reason for the expression ofthe disease in this patient is still unknown. The possibility of unequal X chromosome lionization is currently under investigation. ,2001
1547,Nine forms of AR LGMDs a heterogeneous group of muscular progressive disorders have been identified. Four genes which code for the sarcogly can glycoproteins from the DGC cause the more severe forms thesarcoglicanopathies (LGMD2C 2D 2E and 2F). The five milder forms areLGMD2A LGMD2B LGMD2G LGMD2H and LGMD2I and the known pro tein products are calpain 3 (2A) dysferlin (2B) and telethonin (2G).Through imunohistochemistry and western blot analysis we studied theexpression of the 7 known LGMD proteins in 218 muscle biopsies frompatients with clinical diagnosis of LGMD (195 families). A total or partialdeficiency of the following proteins was observed sarcoglycan (a b g d sarcoglycans) in 29 families calpain 3 in 60 families dysferlin in 25 fam ilies and telethonin in 4 families. In patients with known pathogenic muta tions it was possible to observe that the primary deficiency of one of theSG protein leaded to the secondary deficiency of the whole complex in themajority of the SG patients but SGs were normal in the 2A 2B and 2Gforms. Calpain 3 showed total or partial deficiency in LGMD2A patients buta secondary deficiency was also observed in two LGMD2B families. Patients with LGMD2B and 2G showed total deficiency of the respectiveproteins but no secondary deficiencies of dysferlin or telethonin wereobserved in patients not linked to these genes. Through protein analysis itwas possible to classify ~60% of the LGMD families suggesting whichgene should be primary screened for identification of mutations.

1548,The Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy included an heterogeneous group ofgenetic disease characterized by weakness on proximal muscles. Themost prevalent of them is the autosomal recessive form LGMD 2A with aclinical course ranging from severe to mild. The LGMD 2A gene whichcodes for calpain 3 has 24 exons. About 97 pathogenic distinct mutationshave been identified along the gene 70% of them are private mutations but a few of them seem to be more prevalent in some populations. We arescreening mutations in the CANP 3 gene in 24 LGMD 2A Brazilian families(including 68 patients) classified through linkage or with calpain deficien cy in muscle. Up to now pathogenic mutations were found in 21 families 6 of them in just one allele. Four novel changes where identified two non sense (R748X and 509 510insA exons 21 and 5) and two missense(K211E and M248R exons 4 and 5) which were not found in 50 normalcontrols. Interestingly although the Brazilian population is highly misci genated 2 recurrent mutations were found (corresponding to 45% of thesample) six families had the same 2362AG TCATCT mutation (prevalentin the Basque population) while five the same R110X change (identifiedonly in Brazilian patients). Haplotype analyzes in 10 of these families sug gest a common origin for these two mutations. No direct correlation wasfound between the type of mutation calpain expression in muscle andseverity of the clinical course particularly due to high intrafamilial variabil ity.

1549,Mutations in dysferlin gene (DYSF) are responsible for both autosomalrecessive LGMD2B and Miyoshi Myopathy (MM). DYSF gene maps tochromosome 2p13 spans more than 150 kb and contains 55 exons. The230 kDa protein product is located on the muscle fiber membrane its func tion is still unknown. Dysferlin RNA expression is strongly detected inskeletal muscle hearth and placenta lower expression is found in brain kidney and lung. The entire coding sequence has been identified as a 6.9kb mRNA. With the aim of investigating dysferlin expression in additionaltissues we analyzed dysferlin transcripts in peripheral blood lymphocytes(PBL) by RT PCR in eight normal controls and in four families with one ormore subjects showing a mild distal myopathy compatible with MM. Using14 overlapping nested sets of primers and PBL total RNA as template weamplified the entire dysferlin coding sequence. In PBL mRNAs of both nor mal and MM individuals we observed the same sequences as comparedwith muscle transcripts except for the deletion of 42 bp corresponding tothe skipping of exon 17. This finding suggests the presence of a PBL spe cific splice site. In order to identify small mutations we performed Het eroduplex analysis of the amplified cDNA fragments until now we found apatient homozygous for Arg959Trp missense mutation and detected sev eral polymorphisms. Dysferlin transcripts analysis in PBL seems to be auseful method to screen patients for mutation detection and to study theorganization of dysferlin gene and its expression in different tissues. ,2001
1550,In 95% of FSHD families the genetic defect is a deletion of a variable num ber of KpnI repeats in 4q35 region. Molecular diagnosis is based on thedetection by probe p13E 11 of short EcoRI BlnI resistant fragments (10 35 kb). Sequence homology between 4qter and 10qter loci facilitates inter chromosomal exchanges resulting in the reshuffling of 4q type BlnI resist ant and 10q type BlnI sensitive repeats from one chromosome to the other. In order to verify whether the occurrence of interchromosomal exchangescould play a pathogenic role in association with the 4q35 specificrearrangement we analyzed the segregation of BlnI resistant and BlnI sensitive alleles in 50 FSHD Italian families. DNA extraction and subse quent restriction steps with EcoRI BlnI and Tru9I were performed directlyin agarose blocks. The alleles were separated by PFGE and identified withp13E 11 and KpnI cloned sequences as probes. Both in affected and nor mal individuals we observed all kinds of interchromosomal exchanges (tri somy tetrasomy monosomy nullisomy and partial translocations). Wewere able to establish that the small 4q35 fragment causing FSHD israrely involved in interchromosomal exchanges high MW alleles are morefrequently implicated in subtelomeric translocations in most monosomicpatients the translocated allele was inherited from the parent not trans mitting the disease in 4 out of 8 sporadic cases both parents carried sub telomeric translocations. PFGE analysis of 4q35 rearrangements in FSHDgreatly improves the accuracy of molecular diagnosis and reveals theextent of interchromosomal exchanges suggesting that the instability ofsubtelomeric regions could play a significant role in the molecular mecha nism of the disease. ,2001
1551,Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM) is a group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by adult onset slowly progressive distal and prox imal muscle weakness and typical muscle pathology. Previously we havemapped the gene responsible for a recessive form of HIBM to chromo some 9p1 and narrowed the interval to one single YAC clone of 1Mb insize. As a further step towards the identification of the HIBM gene we haveconstructed a detailed physical and transcriptional map of this region. Ahigh resolution BAC contig that includes the HIBM critical region flankedby marker D9S1804 and D9S1859 was constructed. This contig allowedthe precise localization of twenty five genes and ESTs to the proximalregion of chromosome 9. The expression pattern of those mapped genesand ESTs was established by Northern blot analysis. In the process ofrefining the HIBM interval thirteen new polymorphic markers were identi fied of which 11 are CA repeats and 2 are single nucleotide polymor phisms. Certainly this map provides an important integration of physicaland transcriptional information corresponding to chromosome 9p12 13 which is expected to facilitate the cloning and identification not only of theHIBM gene but also other disease genes which map to this region. ,2001
1552,X linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is an unusual neu romuscular disorder which we recently assigned to chromosome Xq28 bygenetic linkage analysis. Biological and pathological studies evidence highlevels of Creatine Kinase associated to an excessive number of autophag ic vacuoles. By a collaborative network of neurologists neuropathologistsand geneticists we have collected and phenotypically explored 12 XMEAfamilies. According to the pathological homogeneity observed after musclebiopsy and immunohistochemistry experiments performed in affectedmales this disorder appears to segregate as a monogenic trait. We thusembarked in a positional cloning project by choosing a candidate geneapproach. To date more than 20 genes have been either direcly evaluat ed for potential disease causing mutations or their structure and expres sion pattern has been first characterized before searching for mutations. Inorder to improve such approaches we now use large scale mutationscreening apparatus as well as region specific expression microarray tocharacterize a specific muscle expression pattern correlated to this pathol ogy. We will present phenotypic immunohistochemical and genetics datarelated to XMEA. ,2001
1553, wuerzburg.deIn a boy suffering from severe congenital hypotonia and generalized mus cle weakness the muscle histology favoured the diagnosis of a severe formof Myotubular Myopathy. The muscle biopsy showed small rounded mus cle fibres with centrally located nuclei surrounded by a halo. CongenitalMyotonic Dystrophy was excluded by detecting a CTG repeat number inthe normal range on chromosome 19. All 15 exons of the Myotubularin(MTM1 MIM #310400) gene were checked by SSC analysis for sequencevariations. Exon 4 showed an aberrant pattern of bands. Direct sequenc ing revealed a transition of A(194 4)G at the splice acceptor site of intron3. We could not find this sequence variation in more than hundred controlchromosomes. After isolation of RNA from the patient s fibroblasts a regionbetween exon 3 and 5 was amplified by RT PCR. A fragment of normallength containing exon 4 and a short one lacking exactly exon 4 could beproduced in about equal amounts. This was confirmed by direct sequenc ing of the two bands. The RNA lacking exon 4 is out of frame and wouldlead to a non functional protein. Although we do not have the exact amountof alternative splicing in muscle tissue we postulate that the severe form of Myotubular Myopathy in this boy is caused by the described new unusu al splice mutation in the Myotubularin gene. ,2001
1554,Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of adult muscle dys trophies with an estimated prevalence of about 1 in 8000. DM has poly systemic manifestations including muscle weakness and myotonia. It haspattern of Trinucleotide (CTG) repeats in 3 untranslated region of the ser ine Theronine protein kinase gene located on chromosome 19q13.3. Dueto similarity in clinical picture with the other dystrophic patients and the lackof diagnosis methods we decided to establish moleculr analysis for DMgene. A combination of PCR and southern analysis technique was used. PCR products were visualised by silver staining. DNA probe was labeledby digoxigenin and southern analysis was performed. 60 cases wereexamined. DM gene mutation was detected in 30% of the cases. ,2001
1555, tokai.ac.jpAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that manifests as selective upper and lower motor neuron degen eration. The autosomal recessive form of juvenile ALS (ALS2) has previ ously been mapped to the 1.7 cM interval flanked by D2S116 andD2S2237 spanning approximately 3 Mb region on human chromosome2q33 q34. To understand the molecular mechanism for the pathogenesisof ALS2 identification of the gene and mutation that links to ALS2 is essen tial. To identify the transcribed DNA sequences mapped within the candi date region we searched the public databases in GDB Gene map 99 ofthe Human genome and UniGene at NCBI. Further genomic DNAsequences derived from public database were used as quarries to detectESTs. So far 42 putative non overlapping transcriptional units wereassigned to this interval. Those units contained 27 full length transcription al units. Fifteen of 27 genes were known (KIAA0005 CLK1 ORC2L NDUFB3 CFLAR CASP10 CASP8 FZD7 NOP5 UBL1 BMPR2 AIP 1 CD28 CTLA4 and AILIM) and 12 genes were novel (CALS 109 ALS2CR1 ALS2CR2 ALS2CR3 CALS 69 CALS 117 CALS 370 CALS 124 CALS 139 CALS 135 CALS 79 and CALS 156). Complete genom ic organizations of 23 genes out of 27 full length transcripts were definedby the computational analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA sequences. Inaddition a total of 396 exons was detected in 42 transcriptional units. Weanalyzed the expression of transcripts by RT PCR on total RNA extractedfrom normal human brain spinal cord and lymphocyte. So far 32 of 42units have been analyzed for expression and 31 of 32 units wereexpressed at least in the brain or spinal cord. Three single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) that were associated with ALS2 were also identified inthe intronic regions of CALS 139 and CALS 156. Further analyses of thecandidate genes represented by these units in the ALS2 patients are beingperformed to explore the genetic defect of nan,2001
1556,Hereditary spastic paraplegias are characterized by progressive weaknessand spasticity of the lower limbs due to degeneration of corticospinalaxons. Genetic heterogeneity is suggested by different modes of trans mission (autosomal dominant recessive and X linked). Recently twogenes responsible for an autosomal recessive (SPG7) and a dominant(SPG4) form have been cloned. MtDNA deleteions have been found in oneAD family. We investigated 14 AD and 9 AR HSP families. Clinical features Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 397neuroimaging findings and neurophysiological data have been reviewed. Molecular chatacterization included SPG4 and SPG7 genes and mtDNA. Both pure and complicated forms have been recognized in our series. Optic neuropathy retinopathy dementia ataxia and deafness were foundin the complicated forms. MRI disclosed a thin corpus callosum in tworecessive patients who were not linked to chromosome 15q. We did notdetect SPG7 mutations in AR HSP families. Conversely we found fourSPG4 mutations in pure AD HSP. Our data reinforce the notion of the theample variability in the presentation of HSP and confirm the relative rarityof the SPG7 associated form. Also we confirm that SPG4 mutations arefrequent in pure dominant HSP but account for about 30% of the forms. Thorough clinical and molecular studies are needed to address genotype phenotype correlations in HSP. ,2001
1557,Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a neurodegenerative dis order with characteristic neuropathologic findings of combined degenera tion of both the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems of the centralnervous system. The clinical symptoms are diverse with varying combina tions of myoclonus epilepsy ataxia choreoathetosis and dementia. Theprevalence of DRPLA in Japan was estimated as two to four per million arate that is similar to that of Huntington disease in Japan. Outside Japan DRPLA remains rare with previous reports of only eight Caucasian kin dreds including one African American family with Haw River syndrome. The reason for different racial prevalence of DRPLA is unclear. A molecu lar defect in patients with DRPLA identified in 1994 lies in the expansionof an unstable (CAG)n repeat in the DRPLA gene on chromosome 12p. Despite the demonstration of a common molecular defect in DRPLApatients clinical and neuropathological differences have been reportedamong DRPLA patients even within a family. There are also differentranges of normal CAG repeat lengths in different ethnic groups. Herein wedescribe the clinical radiological and genetic features in the first reportedChinese DRPLA family and compare the distribution of CAG repeatlengths at the DRPLA locus in normal Chinese with that of other ethnicgroups. Our study indicated that although the DRPLA allele size is distrib uted similarly in Chinese and Japanese DRPLA in Chinese is rare. So far only one intermediate sized allele containing more than 30 CAG repeatshas been reported in Chinese. The ethnic prevalence of DRPLA seems tobe better correlated with the prevalence of the intermediate sized alleles inindividual populations. ,2001
1558, luebeck.deSpinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA 1 [OMIM 164400]) is an autosomaldominantly inherited progressive neurodegenerative disease that primerilyaffects cerebellar Purkinje cells spinocerebellar tracts and pontine nuclei. The disease results from the expansion of a polyglutamine stretch withinthe SCA 1 protein (ataxin 1). The underlying mutation has been shown tobe an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat present within the coding regionof the gene. Normal alleles range from 6 to 39 units. They are charac terised by interruptions of 1 to 3 CAT trinucleotides that are thought to beinvolved in the stability of the trinucleotide stretch. Cerebeller ataxia hasbeen reported in patients carrying 40 to 81 trinucleotides. Interestingly these pathologic alleles miss any CAT interruptions. We analysed therepeat length and composition of 16 individuals with alleles between 36and 41 triplets for genotype phenotype correlations and have found the 39trinucleotide allele to be either interrupted by CAT repeats or formed by apure CAG stretch. Preliminary correlation studies yield evidence for theexistence of intermediate alleles in SCA 1. ,2001
1559,Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) or Machado Joseph Disease (MJD)is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder cause bythe expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the ataxin 3 protein. A neu ropathological hallmark of SCA 3 are intracellular aggregates forming neu ronal intranuclear inclusions (NII). To characterize cellular responses tonuclear aggregates in more detail we analysed nuclear inclusions inhuman postmortem brain of patients affected by SCA3 and controlsimmunohistochemically using a panel of antibodies directed against chap erones and proteasome subunits. About 20% of the nuclear inclusions inpontine neurons stained positively for the chaperone Hsp90? whereas nostaining by antibodies to Hsp27 Hsp60 and Hsp/Hsc70 was observed. Most nuclear inclusions in SCA3 are ubiquitin positive (75%) suggestingdegradation by ubiquitin dependent proteasome pathways. Surprisinglyonly a minority of the inclusions were immunopositive with antibodiesdirected against subunits of the 20S proteolytic core of proteasomes whereas most inclusions were stained by antibodies directed against the19S regulatory subunits thought to recognize bind and unfold ubiquitinat ed proteins. In addition most NII were immunoreactive with 11S subunitsantibodies. A comparison with normal control brains indicates more intensecytoplasmatic staining and less intense nuclear signals in SCA3 neuronssuggesting a redistribution of proteasomes. The high proportion of NIIstained with proteosome subunits 11S and 19S stands in marked contrastto the small percentage of NII immunostained with the 20S antibodiesused. These results suggest that most neurons containing NII recruit pro teasome subunits to NII possible in an attempt to refold mutant ataxin 3and to dissolve nuclear aggregates. ,2001

1561,Objective. Predominance of three low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)gene mutations in South African Afrikaner patients with familial hypercho lesterolaemia (FH) significantly enhances the diagnostic prospects of the disease in this population. We studied the degree of genetic heterogeneityin Afrikaner FH homozygotes in relation to phenotypic expression of the disease. Methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods wereused to screen FH homozygotes without (or with only one copy of) thethree founder related mutations D154N D206E and V408M for disease related LDLR gene mutations. Afrikaner FH homozygotes with these muta tions known to cause a receptor defective or negative phenotype weregrouped according to genotype for comparative analysis. Results. Muta tions W66G D200G (heterozygous state) and S285L (homozygous state)were identified in three of the four Afrikaner FH homozygotes subjected tomutation analysis. Significantly higher mean total (P<0.008) and LDL cho lesterol (P<0.015) levels were demonstrated in 24 FH homozygotes with atleast one copy of the receptor negative mutation V408M compared with23 patients with receptor defective LDLR gene mutations D154N and/orD206E. Conclusions. Mutations D200G and S258L may represent minor398 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disordersfounder events since these mutations emanating from Europe have previ ously been detected in eight Afrikaner FH heterozygotes. Inclusion of thesemutations in routine DNA screening would facilitate an improved diagnos tic service for FH in the genetically homogeneous Afrikaner population. ,2001
1562,Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD MIM 164200) is an autosomal domi nant condition of dysmorphogenesis and neurodegeneration. The physicalcharacteristics include eye defects craniofacial anomalies dental anom alies hand and foot malformations and neurologic deficits. The clinical andradiological findings appear to define a slowly progressive leukodystrophyand the possibility of genetic anticipation. We have refined the location ofthe ODDD gene on chromosome 6q22 between markers D6S266 andD6S1639 an interval of less than 3 cM. In an effort to clone the ODDDgene we have developed a YAC based physical map of the 6q22 region. We have characterized 37 YAC clones that form a complete contig of thecandidate region with at least two fold redundancy for each marker. Wehave identified the known genes assigned to the candidate region andhave refined their map positions. Several genes were considered as pos sible ODDD candidates and were analyzed by sequencing and SouthernBlot analysis. No mutations were identified in HSF2 HEY2 PLN COL10A1 and GRIK2 genes. More genes are in process of being evaluat ed as candidates. Repeat extension detection analysis did not detect largeCAG repeat expansions as a cause for ODDD. Direct cDNA selection wasperformed using eight YAC clones from the ODDD region and 800 non repetitive clones were isolated. We have analyzed 270 clones by sequenc ing and computational methods and found many to have large open read ing frames and no homologies to known genes and/or ESTs. We are in theprocess of further characterizing these clones that represent putative novelgenes. ,2001
1563,Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the defi ciency of homogentisate 1 2 dioxygenase (HGO) activity. The disease ischaracterized by homogentisic aciduria ochronosis and ochronotic arthri tis. AKU shows a very low prevalence (1 100 000 250 000) in most ethnicgroups. In Slovakia however the incidence of this disorder raises up to1 19000 that is difficult to explain by a classical founder effect since tendifferent AKU mutations have been identified in this relatively small coun try. We have determined the allelic associations of eleven HGO intragenicpolymorphisms for 44 AKU chromosomes from 20 Slovak pedigrees. These data were compared to the HGO haplotypes for all AKU chromo somes carrying corresponding mutations characterized thus far from non Slovak patients. The results show that the mutations P230S V 300G R58fs and IVS1 1G >A are shared by different populations and were prob ably introduced to Slovakia with the founder populations that spreadthroughout Europe. However these mutations represent only 16% of theSlovak AKU chromosomes. On the other hand six of the ten Slovak muta tions including the prevalent G152fs G161R G270R and P370fs mostlikely originated at a single and very small geographical location in thenorthwestern part of Slovakia. Based on the evidence that all six SlovakAKU mutations are associated to HGO mutational hot spots we suggestthat an increased mutation rate at the HGO gene is responsible for theclustering of AKU mutations in such a small geographical region. ,2001
1564,A syndrome of congenital corneal dystrophy and teenage onset perceptivedeafness has been reported in three sibships one of which with consan guineous parents consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. It isreferred to as Harboyan syndrome (MIM 217400). The corneal disorder inHarboyan syndrome is a congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy(CHED). We report a previously undescribed family with Harboyan syn drome. The proband is the sixth of a sibship of nine where four girls andone boy are affected. The parents are second cousins and unaffected. Genome wide homozygosity mapping using 358 microsatellite markersshowed 8 markers from 8 chromosome regions that were homozygous inDNA pooled from the patients while heterozygous in DNA pooled from theparents and unaffected siblings. Further study of individual DNA sampleswith closely spaced markers tentatively identified a segment at 20pter p13for which the affected sibling are homozygous by descent for a haplotypepresent in both parents. This preliminary result indicates the presence of agene at 20pter p13 whose mutation causes both corneal dystrophy andhearing loss. Of note a gene for nonsyndromic autosomal recessiveCHED CHED2 (MIM 217700) was recently mapped to 20pter p13. Thissuggests that Harboyan syndrome and CHED2 may be allelic with somemutations associated with hearing loss. Interestingly no locus was previ ously reported on 20p for recessive hearing loss in spite of the unparal leled genetic heterogeneity thereof. ,2001
1565,M bius syndrome (MBS MIM 157900) consists of a congenital paralysisof the VIIth (facial) cranial nerve frequently accompanied by dysfunction ofother cranial nerves. In addition orofacial and limb malformations defectsof the musculoskeletal system and mental retardation are seen in MBSpatients. In our hospital two new loci were revealed for MBS indicatinggenetic heterogeneity for this syndrome. The MBS2 locus was linked tochromosome 3q21 q22 between markers D3S1589 and ACPP spanning4.9 cM. The MBS3 locus was linked to chromosome 10q21.3 q22.1 between markers D10S581 and D10S502 spanning 3.7 cM. Several inter esting candidate genes were selected based on expression pattern and/orknown function and analysed by SSCP or direct sequencing. CRBP1 SOX14 EGR 2 and hPGT have been screened but no mutations werefound in these genes that could account for the M bius phenotype. For apositional candidate gene approach (partial) YAC contigs have been con structed for both loci and several interesting EST s and genes have beenmapped to these contigs prior to further examination. RNA in situ hybridi sation in mouse embryos was performed to determine the spatio temporalexpression pattern of positional candidate genes from the 3q21 q22 criti cal region. The in situ hybridisation for one paticularly promising candidategene revealed expression in the ganglia as well as in other cell types. Thisexpression pattern is compatible with MBS as the affected facial nerveemanates from the VIIth ganglion. Mutation analysis is being performed onthis gene as well as on several other candidates to proof their involvementin MBS. ,2001
1566,Duane syndrome (DS) is characterized by primary strabism globe retrac tion and narrowing of palpebral fissure associated to variable sight impair ment. DS is mostly sporadic. However some familial cases have beenreported with linkage to chromosome 2. DS has also been related to a con tigous gene syndrome with deletions on chromosome 8q12 13. We previ ously identified a 3 cM smallest region of overlap (SRO) for DS betweenmarkers D8S533 and D8S1767 in a DS patient with a microdeletion. ThenPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 399we investigated a DS patient with gonadal dysgenesis heterozygous for a translocation involving chromosome 8q13. STS and FISH analysisrevealed the break point position within the previously identified SRO cov ered by YAC 820e6. Two cosmid subclones from YAC 820e6 were foundspanning the breakpoint on chromosome 8q. In the breakpoint surround ing region a combination of sequencing data base search and hybridiza tion experiments identified sequences similar to a few ESTs none of whichrelated to known genes. Most of them have been better characterized aswell as the structure and position of the related genes. We positioned thechromosomal break in the second intron of one of these genes which istherefore interrupted by the translocation. Expression of the interruptedgene is almost ubiquitous with high levels in muscle as defined by North ern blot analysis. However its real function and the possible mechanismsinvolved in the disease process remain unsettled ,2001
1567,The characteristic sensitivity of Fanconi anaemia cells is towards crosslink ing agents however there have been several reports of a deficiency in FAcells in the repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) lesions more usuallyassociated with ionising radiation. Some reports have indicated subtle dif ferences in DSB repair kinetics whilst other analyses suggest a compro mise in the fidelity of DSB repair. Similarly Nijmegen breakage syndrome(NBS) is characterised by radiosensitivity but there are also numerousreports of increased sensitivity towards the lesions made by crosslinkers. These observations suggest an overlap in the repair mechanisms forcrosslinks and for DSBs. The gene responsible for NBS was recentlycloned and its protein product nibrin has been extensively analysed. Nib rin is found in the cell as a nuclear complex with the proteins hMre11 andhRad50. It is phosphorylated by ATM the gene mutated in Ataxia teleang iectasia in response to ionising radiation and mediates the relocalisationof the repair complex to discrete nuclear foci (ionising radiation inducedfoci IRIF) visible by immunostaining with antibodies to hMre11 nibrin orhRad50. IRIF are the sites of DSB repair by non homologous end joiningwhich requires the nuclease activity of hMre11/hRad50. We have exam ined the occurrence of IRIF stained for Mre11 Rad50 and/or nibrin in FAprimary fibroblasts and find no gross disturbances of this pathway in anyof the 7 FA complementation groups. Transformation of primary fibroblastsby SV40 T Antigen leads to a significant reduction in IRIF in all cells test ed possibly due to the interaction of T antigen with one or more membersof the complex. This effect is particularly strong in cells from one of the FAcomplementation groups FA D2 and leads to almost complete abrogationof IRIF formation. This suggests that the hMre11/hRad50/nibrin pathwayin these cells is far more readily disturbed by T antigen than it is in controlcells or cells from complementation groups FA E and FA G. Since nibrin isnormally phosphorylated after irradiation in FA D2 cells the disturbance infoci formation must lie downstream of this event. These findings are dis cussed in reference to the cellular DSB repair machinery and its involve ment in the processing of intermediates formed during crosslink repair. ,2001
1568,Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is a hereditary optic neuropa thy with estimated prevalence 1 12 000 (Denmark) to 1 50 000 (USA). Thepredominant genetic locus (OPA1 MIM 165500) resides at 3q28 29. TheOPA1 gene has recently been shown to encode a dynamin relatedGTPase targetted to mitochondria. We have screened a large panel ofADOA families to seek disease related changes in OPA1 and genotype phenotype correlations. Coding exons of OPA1 and splice sites werescreened in >100 ADOA patients of diverse ethnic origin by SSCP het eroduplex analysis and direct sequencing. Clinical data on visual acuity colour vision visual fields and optic disc appearance was collated. Puta tive mutations were tested for familial segregation by SSCP/restrictionenzyme site alteration and in 100 control chromosomes. To date we havefound 13 novel disease mutations and 19 new polymorphisms in nan,2001
1569,Fragile X syndrome a common cause of inherited mental retardation isassociated with a CGG repeat expansion within the FMR1 (fragile X men tal retardation 1) gene. In the normal population AGG triplets are usuallypresent at regular intervals within the repeat region most commonly atpositions 10 and 20. AGG interruptions are thought to stabilize the regionby preventing slippage during DNA replication. In families with fragile X however a different pattern of AGG interruptions has been observed. Sev eral groups have used a variety of techniques to analyze the repeat organ ization in fragile X premutation males and observed either a single or noAGG interruption in the 5 end of the repeat and long tracts of uninterrupt ed CGG repeats in the 3 end. We have developed a procedure forsequencing the repeat that allowed us to examine the alleles in 8 premu tation males with repeats ranging from 95 to 150. In contrast to the resultsof earlier studies sequence analysis revealed that although one male hadno AGG and another had one AGG five had two AGG interruptions in the5 end of the repeat. This suggests that two AGG interruptions may be acommon finding in males with large premutation alleles. If this proves to bethe case in males two AGG interruptions may also be observed in somepremutation females particularly in those whose offspring seem less like ly to undergo expansion to a full mutation. ,2001
1570,Fragile X syndrome is the most common inheritable disease that accountsfor mental retardation in 1 4000 males and 1 6000 females worldwide. The disease is caused by the expansion of a CGG repeat in the first exon of theFMR1 gene and the subsequent hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter. By means of Southern blot analysis of EcoRI/EagI digested gDNA wedetermined the length of the CGG repeat segment and the methylation sta tus of the FMR1 gene in 115 probands (105 males and 10 females) withmental retardation of unknown origin 12 obligate carriers and 27 sibs. All115 probands included in this analysis scored above 16 points accordingto Butler check list. 23 of them (20%) beared either full mutations (20) mosaic (2) or partially methylated full mutation (1). The high percentage offull mutations may result from an ascertainment bias or an unusual highfrequency of the disease in the Chilean population. In 12 carrier motherswith premutated allele (CGG)89 165 and full mutation the recurrence riskof having an offspring with full mutation was 10/20 (50%) and 6/7 (86%) respectively. This is a relative lower risk of expansion even for large pre mutations. The absence of carriers with intermediate number of repeats isindicative of underdiagnosis and points out to the need for a fragile Xscreening program in schools for children with learning disabilities in Chile. ,2001
1571,Stroke is a leading cause of death and neurological disability in adults. Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a disease characterized byhemorrhaegic lesions which affect the brain leading to stroke. CCM anautosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance is relatively common400 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorderspresenting in 0.5% of the general population. To date three genetic loci for CCM have been identified. CCM1 is caused by mutations in the KRIT1gene at 7q21 and it encodes a binding protein for Krev 1/rap1a a putativetumor suppressor. CCM2 and CCM3 have been localized to chromosomes7p13 p15 and 3q25.2 27 respectively but the causative genes are stillunknown. A CCM patient was identified having a familial inversion on chro mosome 7 [46 XY inv(7)(p15 q36)]. Using fluorescence in situ hybridiza tion (FISH) mapping the p15 breakpoint of the inversion could be localizedwithin a yeast artificial chromosome clone that mapped to the critical regionat 7p13 p15 defined by family studies. Further FISH mapping led to theidentification of a bacterial artificial chromosome clone spanning the 7p15inversion breakpoint. Through genomic DNA sequence analysis and cDNAcharacterization a gene was found that was directly interrupted by theinversion. The gene was determined to be expressed as a major transcriptof 2.3 kb in all tissues examined and additional alternative spliced tran scripts have also been characterized. We are currently screening DNAfrom CCM2 families as well as sporadic patients for mutations to prove thisnew gene is involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral cavernous malfor mation. ,2001
1572, hop paris.frPseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an inherited disorder of connectivetissue affecting essentially but not exclusively the elastic network andresulting in skin lesions decreased vision and vascular symptoms withhighly variable phenotypic expression. We have recently identified muta tions in the ABCC6 gene which encodes a transmembrane protein mem ber of the ATP binding cassette subfamily C as the genetic defect respon sible for PXE. The ABCC6 gene consists of 31 exons spanning 75 kb ofDNA on chromosome 16p13.1. Here we report on the finding of a pseudo gene that is highly homologous to nan,2001
1573,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of autosomal recessive neuro muscular disorders characterized by degeneration of the anterior horncells of the spinal cord leading to symmetrical muscle weakness and atro phy. Deletions of the SMNt gene located at chromosome 5q13 have attrib uted in more than 90 % of the SMA patients. In the present study we reportan unusual case of childhood onset SMA with a homozygous deletion ofSMNc gene. The patient was a 5 year old boy with delayed motor mile stones hypotonia muscle wasting and weakness clinically presenting aSMA phenotype. Molecular studies using Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR RFLP) and SingleStranded Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis with exons 7 and8 of the SMN gene showed the presence of SMNt but complete absenceof SMNc gene in the patient. The sequence analysis of the critical region(exon 7) of the SMN gene did not show any microdeletion duplication orpoint mutation in SMNt and also confirmed the homozygous deletion of theSMNc gene copies. Densitometric analysis of exons 7 and 8 also revealedthe presence of normal copies of the SMNt gene in the patient. The resultsof our study suggest that young onset SMA may result from centromericdeletion of the SMN gene in certain subtypes of SMA. This further adds tothe clinical and genetic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy. ,2001
1574,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a frequent autosomal recessive neu rodegenerative disorder leading to proximal paralysis with muscle atrophy. The gene involved in SMA located on the chromosome 5q13 was clonedand named the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. SMN gene is presentin telomeric (SMNT) and centromeric (SMNC) copies. Most patients withSMA carry homozygous deletions of exons 7 and/or 8 of the SMN gene. Recent studies demonstrated that the loss of the SMNt occurs by two dif ferent mechanisms deletion or conversion of SMNt to SMNc. Although twostudies found a roughly equal distribution of conversion event in all typesof SMA recently it has been reported that the conversion event usuallyoccurs in patients with milder SMA phenotype. Until now however it stillremains unknown if a sequence conversion event may also be associatedwith SMA type IV which represents the mildest form within the spectrum ofthe SMA phenotype. We present the molecular analysis of three patientswith adult onset SMA who carried an apparent homozygous deletion ofSMNt exon 7 but not of exon 8. By a simple PCR based assay we demon strated that in each case the apparent isolated deletion of SMNt exon 7was a gene conversion event of SMNt to SMNc. In conclusion our resultsprovide first evidence that a conversion event may be also associated withadult onset SMA phenotype and further support the notion that a geneconversion event may be correlated with a milder SMA phenotype and alater onset of disease. ,2001
1575,We have studied the deletions of the SMN (exons 7 8) and NAIP (exon 5)genes in 61 SMA patients. Homozygous deletions of either one or bothexons 7 and 8 of SMN1 have been demonstrated in 98 4% of SMApatients. Of 61 patients 17 showed a homozygous deletion of NAIP exon5 and SMN1 exons 7 and 8 36 showed a homozygous deletion of SMN1exons 7 and 8 and 8 have chimeric SMN2/SMN1 gene. Homozygousdeletions of exon 5 of NAIP gene have been demonstrated in 53 3% ofSMA type I and 5% of SMA type II patients. Chimeric SMN2/SMN1 genePosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 401has been demonstrated in 3 3% of SMA type I 10% of SMA type II and 45 5% of SMA type III patients. Prenatal diagnosis has been performed in20 SMA families by means of analysis of deletion of SMN1 and NAIPgenes and STR polymorphisms. SMN1/SMN2 ratio was analyzed by thedensitometry analysis (ALFexpress /Amersham Pharmacia Biotech/ andUltroscan XL /LKB/) of PCR products of exon 7 of SMN genes digested byDraI. This ratio ranged from 0.4 to 2.7 for SMA carriers (n=59) and from 0.9to 3.8 for control individuals (n=97). For all ratios from 0.4 to 1 and from 1.5to 3.8 the significant differences between SMA carriers and individualsfrom control group have been observed. We suggest that such approachwill be useful for population screening of SMA carriers. ,2001
1576,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a frequent autosomal recessive neuro muscular disorder leading to weakness and atrophy of voluntary mus cles. The survival motor neuron gene (SMN) a SMA determining gene ispresent in two highly homologous copies (telSMN and cenSMN). Themutations in telSMN are responsible for SMA. The large majority of SMApatients show homozygous deletions of either exon 7 or both exons 7 and8 in this gene. The homozygous deletion of exons 7 and 8 of telSMN genewas detected in 85 % of the Russian SMA patients. 37 ( 12 %) SMApatients show absence of exon 7 telSMN gene but retention of exon 8. Thispicture is caused by either large deletion up to exon 8 or gene conversionevent resulting in existence of chimeric gene. We suggest a simple andrapid assay of identification chimeric gene. This method allows to carryout analysis using one step PCR with telSMN/cenSMN specific primers. Chimeric gene was revealed in patients with mild form of the desease. ,2001
1577,Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder withthree major clinical phenotypes (SMA type I II and III). The disease iscaused by deletion conversion or in rare cases by point mutations in thetelomeric survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. There is a centromeric copyof the SMN gene SMN2 whose copy number influences clinical severity indicating that SMN2 gene is the main modulator in the clinical phenotype. Another important neighbouring gene coding for neuronal apoptosisinhibitory protein (NAIP) might also play a role in influencing the pheno type. In this study we present the genetic analysis of 108 SMA familiesaimed to find genotype phenotype correlations. In addition to the 122 indexpatients carrier parents and sibs 195 individuals were also included in thestudy. Homozygous deletions in exons 7 and 8 of SMN1 and in exon 5 ofNAIPt genes were recorded and correlated with the type of clinical severi ty. In addition lack of SMN2 gene was also recorded although the exactcopy number could not be established. Results were compared withhealthy controls. In our data deletion of exon 5 of NAIPt occured more fre quently in SMA I (63%) than in SMA II (9.3%) and III (4 5%) patients. Thesame findings were reported in other SMA populations however the differ ence between clinical types was much higher in our patients. In conclusion the size of the deletion in 5q13 might be in closer correlation with theseverity of the disease in the Hungarian SMA patients. ,2001
1578,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common autosomal recessive neuro muscular disorder with a variable phenotype caused by mutations in thesurvival motor neuron gene (SMN1) and phenotypically modulated bySMN2 copies. In our sample the SMN1 gene is absent in 84.2% of SMApatients so according to Hardy Weinberg equilibrium 99.3 % of all SMAcases must carry at least one SMN1 deleted chromosome. In order to iden tify the compound heterozygous in our group of nondeleted SMA patientsand to study the correlation between the SMN2 copy number and theseverity of SMA disease we have developed a PCR quantitative assayusing fluorescent primers. This assay based on the method described byMcAndrew has enabled us to determine the SMN1 and SMN2 copy num ber. From 35 non deletion SMA patients analysed we have found six indi viduals with only one copy of nan,2001
1579,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the second most common fatal autoso mal recessive disease after cystic fibrosis with the frequency 1 10000newborn. The results of deletion analysis in 23 SMA families from the NorthÃ¢\x80\x94 West region of Russia are reported. The deletions in the SMN 1 genewere the major mutations in these families. Different types of deletionswere found in 22 of 23 patients with SMA (96%). Homozygous deletions ofexon 7 and 8 in SMN 1 were identified in 65 % of our patients while theNAIP gene (exon 5) was deleted in 22% (5/23) of them. Homozygous dele tion of exon 7 of SMN 1 was detected in one SMA patient (4.3%) only. Analysis of deletions of SMN 1 SMN 2 and NAIP genes have shown thatpatients from the North West region of Russia have 7 types of deletiondamage. The most frequent deletion in SMA patients was the deletionexons 7 and 8 in SMN 1 gene. ,2001
1580,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common severe autosomal recessive disease. Homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the telSMN gene is found in 90 98% of SMA patients. Couples having children with SMA face a 25% riskof having affected offspring with spontaneous conception. PGD is an alter native method to prenatal diagnosis for couples who have a high risk of aninherited disease in their offspring. Two couples with SMA affected childrenwere enrolled in PGD IVF program. We performed PCR using a mismatchprimer to detect exon 7 deletion of telSMN. To determine the efficiency ofPCR at single cell level we tested 55 blastomeres. The PCR efficiencywas 69%. In PGD IVF cycle 67% (4/6) and 64% (7/11) of blastomereswere found to be unaffected and four embryos were replaced back to theuterus in each patient. One patient failed to get pregnant and the other isnow at 34 weeks of uneventful ongoing pregnancy. Genetic status of thefetus was confirmed by prenatal diagnosis with amniotic fluid cells per formed at 16 weeks of gestation. This study shows that PGD is feasible forcouples having a child with a deletion of homozygous exon 7 in telSMN. ,2001
1581, strasbg.frX linked myotubular myopathy is characterized by neonatal hypotonia muscle weakness and respiratory distress in affected males leading oftento early death. It is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene (myotubularin).The myotubularin family counts at least 10 members in humans 6 indrosophila and a single one in yeast. It can be subdivided in four sub groups already present in C. elegans and three groups have predictedphosphoinositide binding domains. MTMR2 a close homologue of MTM1 was recently found mutated in a recessive form of Charcot Marie Toothneuropathy. These proteins share the consensus active site of tyrosine anddual specificity protein phosphatases and of the lipid phosphatase PTEN. Recent results indicate that myotubularin is primarily a lipid phosphatase acting on phosphatidylinositol 3 monophosphate (PI3P) and may beinvolved in the regulation of PI3 kinase pathway. We have recently found402 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disordersmutations in 14 patients including 7 novel ones. We identified the most distal point mutation a nonsense associated to a very severe phenotype. Missense N180K was found in a 65 years old grandfather (the oldestknown patient with an MTM1 mutation) previously suspected to have auto somal centronuclear myopathy and in his two grandsons also mildly affect ed. P226T was found in a 12 years old boy who had respiratory distressat birth but attends now regular school and walks unaided. The later twocases confirms that some missense mutations are associated with mildmuscular phenotype and very prolonged survival. We present a summaryof the 140 different mutations identified up to now in 211 families. ,2001
1582,Deficiency of the mitochondrial matrix protein frataxin is the cause ofFriedreich ataxia an autosomal recessive disease characterized by neu rodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. Frataxin is thought to prevent toxiciron accumulation in mitochondria. Accordingly progressive atrophy ofneurons and cardiomyocytes in Friedreich ataxia may result from mito chondrial dysfunction caused by iron mediated free radical damage. How ever the disease is likely to involve a specific developmental cell loss par ticularly affecting sensory neurons in addition to the more obvious degen erative process. The early embryonic lethality of frataxin / mice also sug gests a role of this protein during development. To study the role of fratax in during differentiation we utilized the multipotent P19 mouse embryoniccarcinoma cells. Frataxin expression is induced two to three fold when P19cells differentiate into neurons cardiomyocytes or endodermal cells anincrease that can only be partially explained by an increase in mitochondr ial mass particularly in the case of neural differentiation. Stable transfec tion of undifferentiated P19 cells with a frataxin antisense construct doesnot inhibit their proliferation as precursor cells but severely and specifical ly compromises neuronal differentiation. Apoptotic cell death that normal ly occurs in a few cells when this differentiation pathway is induced isgreatly enhanced by frataxin deficiency. Induction of cardiomyocyte orendodermal differentiation which is not normally accompanied bydetectable apoptosis is not affected by low frataxin. Hence frataxin defi ciency does not lead to apoptosis by itself but appears to increase the vul nerability of differentiating cells to normally occurring apoptosis. This effectmay result from an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species asindicated by increased levels of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase infrataxin deficient cells. Our results raise the possibility that the early lethal ity of frataxin knockout mice and sensory neuronal loss in Friedreich atax ia may be due at least in part to higher sensitivity to apoptosis of fratax in deficient embryonic cells. Such vulnerability may be due to interferencewith signaling pathways rather than to a direct damaging effect of free rad icals. ,2001
1583,FSHD is the third most common hereditary disease of muscle. It is a higlyvariable disorder considering the age of onset and the clinical severity even within the same family. The disease is transmitted in autosomal dom inant fashion the estimated incidence is 1 in 20000 although new sporadicpatients have been reported frequently. The FSHD locus has been mappedto 4q35 (FSHD1A) and is closely linked to the highly polymorfic locusD4F1104S1. No gene has been detected in this region but a number ofshort repetitive sequences (D4Z4) were found. Deletion of D4Z4 leads toFSHD. A marker p13E 11 that mapped to 4q35 revealed shorter frag ments in genomic DNA digested with EcoRI in patients with FSHD com pared to control individuals. The fragment in patients is smaller than 38 kb. We introduced FSHD molecular diagnosis in our laboratory at the begin ning of 2000 using p13E 11 probe. Since than seven families including 18patients have been examined. Asymptomatic family members have beenincluded into the study as well. Out of these cases three patients wereidentified as familiar and two as sporadic FSHD cases. Two additional fam ilies are under evaluations. The genetic analysis was based on EcoRI/BlnIdigestion Southern blotting and hybridisation with p13E 11 probe. Thismethod enabled us to distinguish between the FSHD locus on 4q35 andthe highly homologous region of 10q26. The analysis was extended bydosage test using BglII/BlnI double digestion and the same probe in orderto identify individuals carrying translocated alleles from the homologous region of 10q26. ,2001
1584,Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset autosomaldominant (AD) disease characterized by dysphagia ptosis and proximallimb weakness. OPMD is caused by an expansion of a GCG trinucleotidestretch in the first exon of the PABP2 gene which usually contains six GCGcopies ([GCG]6) whereas the mutated gene contains 8 to 13 copies. The [GCG]7allele found in 2% of the population may act as a recessive muta tion or as a modifier of the dominant genotype. Nine Portuguese patients with OPMD (comprising six families) and 110randomly selected controls were studied by DNA analysis. Fluorochrome tagged primers were designed to amplify a fragment encompassing theGCG repeats. Amplicons were subjected to capillary electrophoresis andsized with the ABI GeneScan program (Applied Biosystems). Allele sizeswere confirmed by sequencing several samples from homozygous andheterozygous individuals. The diagnosis of OPMD was confirmed in the five families all of which pre sented mutations in heterozygosity in accordance with the observed ADpattern of inheritance. The [GCG]9expansion was found in four fami liesand [GCG]10in the fifth. The [GCG]9allele was previously found to be the most prevalent amongst French Canadian patients. In order to test the one founder theory studies with linked markers are in progress to deter mine the haplotype background of the [GCG]9allele. Two individuals het erozygous for [GCG]6and [GCG]7alleles were also detected in the con trol population corroborating the described polymorphic nature of the lat ter in this allelic combination. ,2001
1585, strasbg.frFriedreich ataxia (FRDA) the most frequent inherited ataxia is caused byloss of function of frataxin. In Caucasian population the most frequentmutation is a large GAA repeat expansion in the first intron. In some rarecases the expansion is interrupted by other repeat sequences. The pres ence and size of the GAA expansions can be determined by Southern blotanalysis which is reliable but time consuming or more commonly by longrange PCR which is simpler but not reliable for the detection of heterozy gotes. We are now currently analysing the FRDA (GAA) repeat by the flu orescent triplet primed PCR (TP PCR) method initially developped byWarner et al. for myotonic dystrophy (1996). This method is simple andreliable to detect all the cases with at least one expansion which is not thecase for the long range PCR. However artefacts and pitfalls may cause dif ficulties to distinguish homozygous from heterozygous expansions themain exemple being when the GAA expansion is interrupted by otherrepeat sequences. We present a study of patients from Reunion Islandwho present interruption of the GAA expansion by a (GAAAGAA) repeatsequence and some other patients from different origins who presentanother type of interruption a (GAGGAA) hexanucleotide repeat. Thesmall size of these expansions and their stability observed during trans missions may suggest that interruptions of the GAA repeat confer meioticstability as it has been observed for other disease causing expansionssuch as the fragile X (CGG) repeat. ,2001
1586,The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) Int13 Int22 and St14 wasanalysed to find out the polymorphism distribution in normal individuals inthe central region of Mexico and evaluate the efficacy of this markers forcarrier detection of hemophilia A. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)was done in 162 X chromosomes from unrelated Mexicans and the samemethod was applied to carrier detection in hemophilia A families. Screen ing revealed the existence of at least eight different alleles for Int13 fourPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 403for Int22 and ten for St14. Their heterozygous rate were 41.3% 52.6% and 83% respectively. Compared to Caucasians the Mexican populationshowed a markedly low heterozygous rate for Int13 marker. However Int22showed a relatively higher heterozygosity similarity to Turkish and Chinesepopulations. The St14 marker was the most informative and a new 680 pballele were detected. Gene diagnosis was performed in 30 suspectedhaemophilia A carriers from 6 families. 22 females (73%) were heterozy gous for at least one of the markers used only 8 females (26%) werehomozygous. Determination of polymorphisms in Int13 Int22 and St14VNTRs should prove to be a useful tool in the genetic diagnosis ofhaemophilia A in Mexico. ,2001
1587,A distinct nosologic entity that shows manifestations of progeroid syn drome combined with Ehlers Danlos (E D) features (OMIM 130070) hasbeen reported in about a half dozen cases. We have recently studied a 4year old brazilian boy with features consistent with this diagnosis. Thepatient exhibited developmental delay short stature progeroid facies craniofacial disproportion with small face prominent ears scanty eyelash es late closure of fontanels bilateral cataracts loose skin and prominentveins on both hands bruisability surgically repaired bilateral inguinal her nia pectus excavatus joint hypermobility in digits bilateral hip dislocationand waddling gait. The molecular basis of this rare progeroid syndrome with affected proteo glycan biosynthesis has been searched by some investigators. The cDNAof the galactosyltransferase I (XgalT 1) was isolated by two of us (Okajima T and Furakawa K) and after that we were able to identify and character ize two mutations in the galactosyltransferase I gene of one patient (J BiolChem 274 (41) 28841 1999). The results indicated that mutations inXGalT 1 were at least one of main molecular basis for progeroid form of E D syndrome. In the boy here reported and in his unaffected parents the genomicsequence of galactosyltransferase 1 (b4GalT7) was analysed by directsequencing of PCR products obtained from amplification of exon segmentswith primers located in flanking intron or UTR sequences. However nomutations could be detected except for a single silent heterozygous muta tion (R73R CGC to CGT) in exon 2. This finding may imply that other relat ed glycosysltransferases are probably mutated in this patient and that fur ther study of its pathogenic role in this disease should be undertaken. ,2001

Only themales with non obstructive azoospermia were included in this study. The Ychromosomal microdeletions chromosomal aberrations and other infertili ty factors were evaluated. Analyzed males with RD were divided into 3groups according to their sperm counts (I. 0 1x106/ml II. 1 20x106/ml III. >20x106/ml). Significant differences to controls were observed mainlyin Group I. where the frequency of delta F508 mutation was raised to11.4% (p=0.015) in 100% association with the TG10/T9 haplotype. More over these patients had an increased prevalence of TG12/T7(15.9% p=0.015) and a decrease of TG11/T7 (27.3% p=0.0002) haplo types. Increased frequency of 1540 A/G AA genotypes was observed inGroups I. III. with the highest significance (p=0.0004) observed in GroupI. The Y chromosome microdeletions were found in 9.1% of Group I. malesonly. In females from RD couples the tendency towards a decrease ofIVS8(T)9 (4.3% p=0.05) increase of both the IVS8(TG)12 (15.4% p=0.03)and (TG)12/(T)7 haplotypes (14.9% p=0.04) were disclosed. The patoge netic impact of these findings has to be clarified by further studies. Theseresults support the hypothesis that CFTR gene mutations and polymor phism might also affect spermatogenesis/sperm viability and point out theimportance of CFTR mutation/polymorphism screening in couples withsevere RD.

1589,Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutationscanning using an optimized denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) system has been performed in clinically well defined cohorts ofpatients of Dutch origin with cystic fibrosis (CF) congenital bilateralabsence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) oligospermia or pancreatitis. Inover 98% of (>800) fully analysed independent alleles of CF patients amutation has been identified in the coding sequence of the CFTR gene orin a flanking intronic sequence including six novel mutations. In addition in two patients a hemizygous genomic deletion involving part of a CFTRallele has been identified. In approximately 90% of (50) fully analysed independent alleles of CBAVD patients a mutation has been identified including four novel mutations. Particular mutations including A455E and3272 26A>G that are associated with mild CF were also detected inCBAVD. Homozygosity for the A455E mutation was shown in a CBAVDpatient. The relative frequency of the IVS8 5T allele appears to be hardlyincreased amongst Dutch CBAVD patients (4/50 alleles). In a cohort ofclinically strictly defined oligospermia patients (160 alleles studied) anincreased frequency of CFTR missense or (potential) splicing mutationswas identified in addition to two deltaF508 alleles and an IVS8 5T allele. Some mutations have been reported as (potentially) pathogenic including296+9A>T (once opposite to the non pathogenic mutation R668H) A120T(once) G576A and R668C on a single allele P750L (once) L997F (twice) S1235R (twice). This results in a frequency of 11/80 oligospermia patientscarrying a pathogenic CFTR mutation. Other detected variants most likelydo not or hardly alter the function of the CFTR protein. These mutationsinclude V11I R75Q (8 times) R297Q and 1341+12T>A. No truncatingmutations have been identified. A similar analysis in pancreatitis patients iscurrently ongoing. A complete overview of the mutations identified in allcategories of patients studied will be presented. ,2001
1590,"Fifteen common mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduc tance regulator gene (CFTR) were studied in 305 CF patients fromUkraine. The most frequent mutation found according to our expectationwas delF508 (40.8%). Ten further mutations were identified in our sample N1303K (2 65%) CFTRdele2 3(21kb) (1.4%) G542X (0 6%) W1282X(0 5%) R334W (0 3%) R553X (0 3%) 1677delTA (0 3%) R347P (0 3%) 1717 1GtoA (0 3%) G551D (0 16%).

We conclude that the 21kb deletionis a frequent mutation in Ukranian population as well as in populations ofEastern and Western Slavic descent. Screening for this deletion will sig nificantly improve the molecular genetic diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in fam ilies from Ukraine. Pilot carrier screening of these mutations was per formed in 126 patients from IVF clinic involved in IVF program. We havedetected CF carrier status in 3 case (delF508). The same mutation analy sis program was performed in 98 non fertile (non CBAVD) men involved inICSI program. We have detected CF carrier status in 2 case (delF508).The CFTR gene mutation test for CF carrier partners was recommended.

Gallati1 1Molecular Human Genetics Bern Switzerland 2Department of Paedi atrics Bern S', 'The genotype phenotype relation in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is known to bevery complex. Disease severity even varies among CF patients carryingthe same CFTR genotype. Factors that contribute to this variability are top ics of intense study. The rate of exon 9 skipping from CFTR mRNA isbelieved to be one of these contributing factors. Variations in the TG(m)and T(n) polymorphic repeats at the 3 end of intron 8 of the CFTR geneare associated with the alternative splicing of exon 9. The most commonmutation delta F508 is linked to the TG10/T9 polymorphism which waspreviously shown to lead only to negotiable amounts of exon 9 skipping. Using the LightCycler system we developed a new sensitive one step RT PCR method with high accuracy. In a clinically well described group (n=10)of delta F508 homozygous CF Patients (TG10T9/TG10T9) we performedquantitative real time RT PCR to determine the ratio of the aberrantlyspliced transcripts (Range between 2 and 23 %) in nasal epithelium andbuccal cells. In addition we determined the total number of normal andaberrantly spliced transcripts using ribosomal 28S rRNA for standardiza tion. We found that a decrease of CFTR transcripts (up to 70 fold) and anincrease in aberrantly spliced transcripts (up to 10 fold) in early childhoodis associated with a severe course of CF disease. Therefore quantitativetranscript analysis is a valuable indicator of disease progression. ",2001
1591,Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions asa chloride channel and controls the regulation of other transport pathways. Mutations in the CFTR gene are the cause of cystic fibrosis. Nowadays ita lot of mutations with different frequency in different populations areknown. We have developed two multiplex PCR systems for simple andrapid detection of the 11 more frequent mutations in CFTR gene in Russ ian population patients. The first one includes 8 pairs of primers whichallowed reviled the follow mutations del 21 kb Ã\x98F508 DI507 1677delTA 2143delT 2184insA 394delTT 3821delT. The second one allows to detectG542X W1282X and N1303K mutations by PCR/restriction analysis. Weconstructed pairs of primers which create the Bse NI recognition site innormal allele of each PCR product. The common informativity of both sys tems are 71%. ,2001
1592,Role of CFTR gene is well recognised in the pathogenesis of several lung diseases in adulthood but few data are available in the paediatric popula tion with respect to some lung diseases suggestive of CF with normal orborderline sweat test. In order to verify the pathogenetic role of mutationsor polymorphism in the CFTR gene we performed the DNA analysis in acohort of 80 patients (aged 4mo 17yr) not related and with no familial his tory for CF. Patients were referred to our Paediatric Department becausethe presence of chronic (over 3 months) respiratory symptoms (cough wheezing or sputum production). The screening of 11/27 exons of theCFTR gene and their intronic flanking regions was performed by Denatur ing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and automaticsequencing was performed on the anomalous DGGE patterns. Ten differ ent known mutations (F508del G542X I148T 1717 1G >A R553X R1066C S1235R R117H 3667ins4 and D110H) were identified at het erozygous state in 14/80 unrelated patients (17.5%). Seven compoundheterozygotes (M1V/4382delA F508del/R352Q F508del/S1252N F598del/3849+10kbC >T (3) A120T/F1052V) leading to CF diagnosiswere identified in 7/80 (8.75%). In 21/80 (26%) of paediatric patients withchronic respiratory symptoms at least one CFTR gene mutation was pres ent showing a significant increase over the expected carrier frequency of1/28 (3 5%) in the same population. The clinical laboratory and radiologi cal evaluations identify several causes of respiratory symptoms and somesubjects were afterwards diagnosed as cystic fibrosis patients (CF). Weobserved nasal polyposis in 7 patients (1 CF) chronic sinusitis in 6 aller gic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in 5 (3 CF) disseminated bronchiec tasies in 8 (2 CF) lobar atelectasia in 5 BPCO in 28 asthma in 14 bron chiolitis in 7 (1 CF). All patients presented sweat test in the normal or bor derline ranges (<60mEq/l) and also their pancreatic function was normal. In conclusion in our paediatric cohort CFTR gene plays a relevant role indetermining lung disease together with behavioural factors. It is noticeablethe relevant number of Cystic Fibrosis diagnosis among this cohort ofpatients with sweat test in the borderline or normal range. We suggest per forming a molecular study of CFTR gene in paediatric patients with chron ic respiratory symptoms also with a normal sweat test. ,2001
1593,Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease in the Caucasian population caused by several mutations in thecystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. Mutation frequen cies vary among ethnic groups being the most common a Phenylalanine508 deletion (Ã\x98F508). Aim Detect the presence of the mutations Ã\x98F508 G542X N1303K G551D R553X and S549N and other mutations in exon10 11 and 21 of CFTR gene in 5th region patients with a previous clinicaldiagnosis of CF. Patients and methods 14 non related patients were stud ied 13 had sweat tests chloride concentrations higher than 60 mEq/L andfrequent respiratory tract infections. 9 were pancreatic insufficient. In orderto discard the presence of an immune deficiency we determined seraimmunoglobulins (IgG IgA IgM) and total CD3+ and B lymphocytes. Themutations and M470V polymorphism were analysed by PCR amplification restriction enzyme digestion and electrophoresis and single strand confor mation analysis (SSCA). Results Patient s immunological parameterswere between normal ranges. 5 patients presented Ã\x98F508 mutation and 2patients had G542X mutation both found in one of their chromosomes. Intwo patients we detected a different patern in SSCA that could be due bya second mutation in the exon 10. No association between M470V poly morphism and the presence of the mutations were found. Conclusions Forthe first time G542X mutation had been detected in Chilean population. This mutation is prevalent in Spaniards and we can hypothezise that itcould be the origin of the mutation found in chilean CF chromosomes. Aper tus Laboratorios Andr maco ,2001
1594,We present results of studies carried out in a group of 70 patients with ten tative clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS). Most of the patients(66%) were referred from other pediatric centers in Poland. In 38 (54%)cases probant DNA was only available to limit molecular analysis. Analy ses of DNA methylation microsatellite polymorphism for loci within theAS/PWS region gene dosage of SNRPN and UBE3A mutation analysisperformed by SSCP and DNA sequencing are included in our moleculardiagnostic procedure. Cytogenetic analysis and FISH were performed for4 patients. The clinical diagnosis of AS was confirmed only in 7 cases. ASdiagnosis was excluded in 2 patients (one case of FRAX syndrome & oneof Cohen syndrome). The very low ratio of confirmed clinical diagnosis ofAS is absolutely surprising. We cannot exclude the possibility that wemissed a molecular defect. However the greatest probability is that in test ed patients the clinical diagnosis of AS was mistaken. It points to howmuch still needs to be done to increase practical knowledge of AS amongpediatricians and clinical geneticists in Poland. ,2001
1595, rostock.deParkinson s disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disor ders affecting about 1% of the population over the age of 50. Recently mutations in the alpha synuclein gene have been found to be responsiblefor some rare forms of autosomal dominantly inherited PD. Subsequently alpha synuclein has been identified as a major component of Lewy bodiesalso in sporadic patients. The search for interacting proteins of alpha synuclein revealed the identification of a protein called synphilin 1 whichwas shown to be another component of the Lewy bodies. Therefore weanalyzed the synphilin 1 gene as a candidate for PD. We screened 416sporadic and familiar German Parkinson s disease patients for mutationsin the coding region of the human synphilin 1 gene (SNCAIP). We identi fied no disease causing mutation in the coding region of the SNCAIP gene but direct sequencing revealed 1 intronic (A to G at position 69 5 of thefirst translated exon) and 5 exonic basepairsubstitutions (C729T in exon 3 C1603T in exon 7 G1896C C1953T and G2218C in exon 9). Whereas thefirst three exonic substitutions are silent polymorphisms the C1953T leadsto an Arg652Cys exchange and G2218C to an Glu740Gln substitution. Asthe G2218C substitution is present in several individuals of our unsffectedcontrol group we conclude that the G2218C transversion is rather a poly morphism than a common cause for PD. The functional implication of theG2218C transversion is currently being investigated. ,2001
1596,Mutations underlying PKU in Kuwait (as well as in other Gulf countries)were unknown. To identify these mutations we studied DNA samples from13 unrelated PKU families comprising all PKU cases diagnosed in Kuwait. Six families were of Kuwaiti origin 5 Bedouins 1 Egyptian and 1Lebanese. Most families were consanguineous. DNA samples were testedfor several common PAH gene mutations including IVS10nt546 (IVS10nt 11g >a). Negative samples were studied by heteroduplex analysis in MDEgel followed by sequencing. Six PAH mutations were identified IVS10nt546 (34.6%) K363fsdelG (15.38%) IVS2nt5 g >c (11.5%) G352fsdelG (7.6%) P281L (3.8%) and delE2/IVS2nt1 (3.8%). IVS10nt546was found in Kuwaiti Bedouin and Egyptian K363fsdelG and IVS2nt5g >cin Kuwaiti and Bedouin G352fsdelG in Lebanese delE2/IVS2nt1 inKuwaiti and P281L in Egyptian probands. All IVS10nt546 chromosomeshad an identical haplotype as judged by PCR RFLP and VNTR markers. The same was true for K363fsdelG and IVS2nt5g >c (the latter mutationwas accompanied by IVS2nt19t >c polymorphism). The methodology usedallowed detection of PAH mutations on 20 of 26 PKU chromosomes ana lyzed. More sensitive technique such as SSCP or DDGE has to be usedfor analysis of the remaining six PKU chromosomes (their haplotypes allowto anticipate four other PAH mutations). ,2001
1597,Phenylketonuria (PKU)is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level. More than 380 different mutations in PAH gene have been described todate. They are associated with different geographical and ethnic origin ofindividuals with PKU. Six PAH gene mutations identified in PKU patientsfrom Lithuania represent 80% mutant PAH alleles in PKU patients fromLithuania. The most common mutations R408W (67%) R158Q (8%) andR261Q (5%) have been detected in previous investigations (Kucinskas etal. 1997). The present study included PKU patients from Lithuania withPAH gene alleles not yet identified. DGGE based screening for PAH genemutations and subsequent identification of found changes in nucleotidesequence by direct DNA sequencing were performed. On this basis fivePAH gene mutations rare in our PKU patients (frequency of a correspon ding mutation is shown in parenthesis) were identified G272X (4.04%) E280K (2.02%) A403V (2.02%) R261X (1.01%) and L311X (1.01%). Outof them four (E280K A403V R261X and L311P) were new in Lithuania. Estimation of PKU phenotype (clinical manifestation and biochemical phe notype) dependence on PAH locus genotype was based on the predictlevel of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and the pre treatment serumlevel of phenylalanine. Our data confirm PAH locus genotype correlationwith PKU phenotype revealed by other investigators R408W/G272X severe PKU R408W/E280K severe PKU R408W/R261X severe PKU R408W/L311K severe PKU R408W/A403V mild PKU. ,2001
1598,We carried out genetic investigation of 90 patients with clinically diagnosedphenylketonuria in order to identify the following mutations R408W R158Q Y414C Ivs10nt546 Ivs12nt1. The most frequent mutation foundaccording to our expectation was R408W ( 56%). The frequency of othermutations were R158Q (2 8%) Y414C (1 68%) Ivs10nt546 (1 1%). Muta tion Ivs12nt1 was not found. The allelic variations of the minisatelliteVNTR polymorphism in 380 chromosomes were analysed. 7 allelic vari ants and 15 haplotypes were identified. The VNTR system showed het erozygosity of 72% in Ukraine. We present an analysis of microsatelliteSTR polymorphism by ALFexpress (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TheSTR alleles in 380 chromosomes ranged continuously from 226 254 bp we identified 8 allelic variants and 24 haplotypes. The heterozygosity ofSTR system in Ukraine was 74%. The linkage disequilibrium betweenmutation R408W and minihaplotype VNTR3/SRT238 in Ukraine wasfound. Strong linkage disequilibrium between mutation and minihaplotypehas substantiated the hypothesis of a single origin of this mutation. Earlyprenatal diagnosis based on examination of CVS has been performed in20 PKU families by means of direct analysis of mutations and by STR VNTR polymorphisms analysis. ,2001
1599,"The autosomal recessive disease phenylketonuria (PKU) is the result of adeficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzymatic activity due tomutations in the PAH gene. The average frequency of classical PKU inBashkortostan is 1 10707 newborns. We have carried mutational analysisin 57 families with PKU from the Bashkortostan. Using SSCP analysis fol lowed by sequencing of 7 exon of the PAH gene we have identified 4 muta tions R261Q R252W P281L and R252P and one polymorphism V245V. The mutation R261Q was observed in 8 2% of the PKU chromosomes. Two mutations R252W and P281L were detected in 2 9 and 2 5% of thePKU chromosomes respectively. The new mutation R252P in codon 252 ofexon 7 was found in one PKU family for the first time. The most of thepatients investigated are compound heterozygotes for the missense muta tion R408W and other identified or unknown mutation.

Single strand conformationpolymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to screen for mutations in the TPOgene from five unrelated TIOD patients in Taiwan and five novel mutationswere detected. Three frameshift mutations were found a single T insertionbetween nucleotide position 2268 and 2269 (c.2268 2269insT) in exon 13and two single C deletions at nucleotide positions 843 (c.843delC) and 2413(c.2413delC) in exon 8 and 14 respectively. In addition two singlenucleotide substitutions (c. G1477>A and c. G2386>T) located in exon 9 and13 respectively were identified. The former is a single nucleotide transition resulting in amino acid substitution (Gly493Ser) in the highly conservedregion of the TPO polypeptide. The latter is a single nucleotide transversion resulting in either amino acid substitution (Asp796Tyr) or alternative splicing. Of those identified TPO mutations c.2268 2269insT was most prevalentand was detected as heterozygous in all but one TIOD patients. All five Tai wanese TIOD patients investigated were compound heterozygous in theTPO gene. The method presented in this study could be used for carrierassessment and mutation analysis of newly identified TIOD patients. ",2001
1600, aachen.deCystinuria is a common inherited disorder of defective renal reabsorptionof cystine and dibasic amino acids. Mutations in the SLC3A1 gene encod ing the glycoprotein rBAT cause cystinuria type I. Secondly variants in theSLC7A9 gene have been demonstrated in non type I cystinuria its geneproduct b0 +AT is a subunit of rBAT. To estimate the role of both genes inthe aetiology of cystinuria we searched for sequence alterations inSLC7A9 and SLC3A1. 30 unclassified were investigated. In 15 unclassi fied patients we found point mutations in SLC3A1/rBAT (50%). Screeningof the SLC7A9 gene revealed 10 mutations in 8 unclassified patients(27%). In addition to previously published mutations in the SLC7A9/b0 +AT gene we detected two new mutations (F140S c747delG). Further more 5 new polymorphic sites were identified in SLC7A9. Three out ofthese localised in exons 2 5 and 6 showed statistically significant differ ences between patients and controls. These variants might be markers ofa functional variant in the SLC7A9 gene or in other genes related to cystin uria. An overall detection rate of 73% (22/30) in unclassified patients isdelineated for mutations in both genes. Evidently mutations in furthergenes and modulating factors might influence the phenotype in patientslacking mutations in SLC3A1 and SLC7A9. However the detection ratedoes not reach 100% owing to the limitation of the applied methods. Thepresented data show that testing for mutations in the two currently knowncystinuria genes is a meaningful molecular diagnostic approach as a firststep towards a well directed individual therapy.

1601,The production of transgenic rodents through the illegitimate recombina tion of pronuclear injected DNA can result in insertional disruption of hostgenes. Insertional mutants have formed both important models of mam malian development and routes to the molecular cloning of obscure loci. Of five rat (Sprague Dawley) transgenic lines generated in our laboratoryusing a promoter reporter (egr 1/NGFI A d4EGFP) construct only oneline of intermediate copy number displayed an overt phenotype. The sta bly inherited mutation is characterized by post natal male lethality occur ring at post natal (PN) days 5 11 which follows apparently normal littering peri natal nurture and weight gain. A sub group of (transgenic[tg]) females within each litter exhibit an intermediate phenotype manifested throughgeneral growth retardation (PN8 tg 13.2Ã¢\x80\x930.3g n=10 non tg 17.0Ã¢\x80\x930.6g n=6 PN41 tg 104.8Ã¢\x80\x933.9g n=4 non tg 137.7Ã¢\x80\x931.7g n=8 [meanÃ¢\x80\x93sem]) furgrowth retardation associated with (possibly secondary) skin chafing fromPN8/9 and early eyelid opening (PN11/12 v PN 14/15 in wild type ani mals). In 3 of 14 mutant rats a curling/ kinking of the tail is seen. The sever ity of this is variable even within the same litter. Parental care of themutant female offspring is maintained normally until weaning and thetransgenic mutants proceed to exhibit normal sexual maturity and fecundi ty. Preliminary observations have excluded a change in pituitary growthhormone expression as the underlying cause of growth retardation. Cur rent research is aimed at determining the genomic location of transgeneinsertion. ,2001
1602,Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene result in an X linked form ofmale pseudohermaphroditism known as AIS. These patients present viril ization defects that varies from sligthly undervirilized men with or withoutimpaired spermatogenesis (partial AIS) to subjects with aparently femaleexternal genitalia (complete AIS). We report the molecular analysis of theAR in two males with gynecomastia and normal male external genitalia inwhich two mutations in the steroid binding domain (SBD) of the AR weredetected. In subject #1 a point mutation was identified in exon 8 a C to T(GCG to GTG) substitution originating an Ala870Val change. In subject #2 a previously undescribed mutation was observed in exon 6 an A to G tran sition (CAG to CGG) originating a Gln802Arg change. Mutations affectingamino acid alanine at position 870 of the AR have been previouslydescribed in four unrelated patients three of them (mutants for valineinstead of alanine) exhibiting a partial form of AIS characterized by severehypospadias and the other one (alanine to glycine) with a predominatlyfemale phenotype. In this report we describe a new case of an AR genemutation altering codon 870 which in contrast with previous reports caus es only gynecomastia in a subject with normal male external genitalia andnormal sperm counts indicating the phenotypic diversity associated toidentical mutations in the AIS. Our findings are in accordance with previ ous reports indicating that most cases of subjects with gynecomastia dueto AIS have mutations within the SBD of the AR. ,2001
1603,"The androgen dependent development of male phenotype and genitalstructures depends on the presence of an intact human androgen receptor(AR) that mediates androgen action. The human androgen receptor geneis located on X chromosome Xq11 12. Mutations in the AR gene results inthe X linked androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). AIS is characterized bycomplete or partial absence of hormone action on target cells and resultsin spectrum of disorders in individuals with karyotype 46XY ranging fromnormal female phenotype (complete AIS) to undervirilized or infertile males(partial AIS). We analyzed 7 out of 8 exons (2 8) of AR gene in 42 patientswith diagnosis complete or partial forms of AIS and their mothers from 33families. AR gene have been investigated by PCR SSCP analysis directsequencing and restriction analysis. Nine missense mutations and onemutation in splice site have been identified in 16 individuals with completeand partial forms AIS. In three families mothers of affected individuals wereheterozygous carriers of mutations. Three of the mutations are novel. Twoout of these three novel mutations (C559S (TGC >TCC) IVS 6 DS + 2 T >C) were found in patients with complete form of AIS one of the mutations(G568R (GGG >AGG)) was found in patients with partial form of AIS. Mutation C559S creates a new Mnl 1 restriction site. This mutation hasbeen confirmed by restriction analysis. Seven mutations were previouslyreported. They were identified both in patients with complete form of AIS(V866M A765T L722F G724D) and patients with partial form of AIS(R855H M780I D695N).

Male infertility molecular analysis of Y chromosome microdeletions in a non selected population G. Massazza M. Poma M. R. Iascone U. Giussani D. Chinaglia A. ParmaOspedali Riuniti Bergamo I', 'Among couples with fertility problems male factors are the aetiology inabout 50% of cases. In addition to chromosomal anomalies microdele tions in the azospermic factor region (AZF) in the long arm of Y chromo some have been detected in men with azoospermia or severe oligosper mia. Every year in our Department about 1750 semen analysis are per formed 30% of which interests patients affected by varicocele and theremaining regarding men with fertility impairment. The aims of this studywere 1) to evaluate oligo azoospermia incidence on the total number ofsemen analysed 2) to assess if the only sperm count < 5x106 spermato zoa /ml in oligospermia could be a parameter sufficient to justify the chro mosome Y microdeletion screening 3) to correlate the clinical phenotype ofinfertile men with specific chromosome Y microdeletions In 11 months wehave performed 1615 semen analysis according to WHO guidelines(1992). The patients mean age was 33 years (range 15 62). We found 55azoospermic (3 4%) 282 oligospermic (17 5%) and 1278 normospermicsubjects (79 1%). Oligospermic and azoospermic patients showed all themorphological and functional semen parameters altered compared tomean values of normospermic population. Genomic DNA was extractedfrom 176 semen samples (45 azoospermic 131 oligospermic with spermcount < 5x 106/ml) and from lymphocytes of 16 oligospermic men enrolledin the protocol for assisted reproduction. The samples were analysed forchromosome Y microdeletion by multiplex PCR. Initially we amplified apanel of 6 Y specific STS that can identify 90% of possible microdeletionsin AZF a b c regions (Simoni et al 1998). ZFY and SRY were used asinternal controls of PCR reactions. Among patients selected according totheir sperm count we found 1 azoospermic subject deleted in AZFc locus. The successive histological examination of a testicular biopsy revealed aSertoli cell only syndrome. Among the 16 men enrolled to assisted repro duction protocol the cariotype was 46 XY in 15 subjects and XX in 1 sub ject. Four out fifteen oligospermic men were deleted in AZFb regions(26 6%). Although the number of patients analysed is still low our findingssupport that the research for Y microdeletions could be indicated inpatients with idiopathic infertility and sperm concentration < 5x 106/ml. Thehigh frequency of deletion (26 6%) found in our patients candidate forassisted reproduction suggests the recommendation to perform accurategenetic and molecular screening and genetic counselling before theirenrolment in an intracytoplasmic injection/ in vitro fertilization programme.

1604,Purpose To report a case of vitreous amyloidosis with a transthyretin(TTR) variant Ser44. Case A 44 year old Japanese female had a 2 month history of visual disturbance of the both eyes. No history for ocular andneurological disease existed among relatives. Corrected visual acuity wasRE 0.02 and LE 0.9. Both pupils did not react to light and were about 6mm in diameters. The vitreous in the both eyes were cloudy in which finefibrilar opacities were observed. Pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy of con junctiva of the right eye was performed. Methods Pathological and molec ular genetic studies were performed with the patient s informed consent. The vitreous and conjunctiva specimens were subjected for histopatholog ical examination. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood cells of thepatient and sequencing of the TTR gene was performed. Results The vit reous and conjunctiva specimens showed typical light microscopic andultrastructural features of amyloidosis. Direct sequencing of exon 2 of theTTR gene revealed a single base pair substitution which results in anamino acid substitution at position 44 phenylalanine to serine (TTR Ser 44). TTR Ser 44 variant had been found only in an American patient withamyloidal peripheral neuropathy however no ocular symptoms weredescribed. Conclusion Our studies indicate TTR Ser 44 variant couldcause vitreous amyloidosis. TTR related amyloidosis should be consid ered as a possible cause of vitreous opacities even in the absence of thefamily history. ,2001
1605, rostock.deNiemann Pick type C (NP C) disease is a rare autosomal recessive lipidstorage disorder. Its phenotype is clinically characterized by progressiveneurological deterioration with ataxia epilepsy and supranuclear gazepalsy. Biochemically a block in the translocation of LDL derived cholesterolfrom the lysosomes and Golgi apparatus is considered as the cause of thephenotypic alteration. NPC1 could be established as candidate gene inabout 95% of all NP C patients and its cDNA sequence and exon intronboundaries have been characterized. We describe for the first time thecomplete genomic sequence of human NPC1 covering 51kb. Mutationanalysis in 12 Caucasian NP C patients revealed 6 novel and 3 known dis ease causing alterations. Furthermore several common polymorphisms inexonic and intronic parts of the gene were identified. To assess the trans mission of NPC1 alleles 12 Caucasian NP C patients have been haplo typed for their mutational patterns including the polymorphic exonic lociH215R (644 a>g) I858V (2572 a>g) and N931N (2793 c>t). Additionally the latter SNPs have been haplotyped in 154 alleles of healthy Caucasiancontrol subjects. While 71 8% of our NP C alleles and especially two NP C patients (4 alleles) lacking a second mutated allele shared the haplo type (644g 2572g 2793t) this haplotype accounts for only 46 3 % in thecontrol group. Therefore we consider this haplotype to be associated witha non coding disease causing mutation. Whenever complete sequencingof the open reading frame of NPC1 reveals only one potentially disease related heterozygosity in NP C patients it is recommended to haplotypethese SNPs. ,2001
1606,Alpha Thalassemia is most frequently the result of deletions involving oneor both alpha globin genes on the short arm of chromosome 16. Thesedeletions involve homologous or non homologous recombinations basedupon the presence or absence respectively of homology betweenparental sequences at the site of recombination. One of the most commonmechanisms leading to alpha+ thalassemia involves misalignmentbetween the two highly homologous 4 kb duplicated units in which thealpha globin genes are embedded. Crossing over between the misalignedhomology boxes (X Y and Z) gives rise to the frequently occurring alpha3.7 (Rightward) and alpha 4.2 (Leftward) deletion. However several otheralpha+ thalassemia determinants have been described for which themechanisms are either still unknown or involve a non homologous recom bination event. We report the characterization of a novel 7.9 kb deletiontaking away one of the duplicated alpha globin genes and causing analpha+ thalassemia phenotype in two independent carriers of Surinam Indian origin. The molecular characterization of the deletion breakpointfragment revealed neither involvement of Alu repeat sequences nor thepresence of homologous regions prone to recombination suggesting anon homologous recombination event. This alpha+ thalassemia deletionwas found to give rise to an atypical HbH disease characterized by a non transfusion dependent moderate microcytic hypochromic anemia in com bination with a poly adenylation signal mutation of the alpha globin gene(alpha2 AA). Characterization of alpha+ thalassemia defects is in spite ofthe mild phenotype important for preventing obsolete and deleterious irontherapy in the carrier and severe HbH disease in the progeny. ,2001

All of them are based on PCR methodology. their main advantages are simplicity and rapidity. The analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the blood of the patient affect ed with beta thalassemia is carried out by the Amplification RefractoryMutation System (ARMS) method. The ARMS PCR is a simple and rapidmethod of detecting point mutations restriction fragment length polymor phisms (RFLPs) and small nucleotide insertion or deletion.

1608,Double heterozygosity for hemoglobin (Hb) C and Hb Lepore is a rare con dition which has been described only in a few cases. Hb C is predomi nantly found in Blacks with the highest frequency in West Africa while HbLepore Boston Washington is the most common hybrid Hb found mainly inthe Balkan peninsula. Here we present a 25 year old patient from Croatiawith this condition. The presence of two abnormal hemoglobins wasobserved on cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis during routine hemato logical and hemoglobin investigation. Hb C was characterized by DNAsequencing while the presence of Hb Lepore Boston Washington wasconfirmed by PCR amplification of the Lepore hybrid gene using 5 delta and 3 beta globin gene specific primers followed by Pvu II restriction enzyme digestion. Family studies showed that Hb Lepore was inheritedfrom the patient s father who has a Croatian ancestry while Hb C wasinherited from his mother who originates from Hungary. Since Hb C hasbeen found very rarely in this region haplotype analysis were performed totrace its origin in this family. It is known that Hb C occurs almost exclusivelyon one haplotype with a few exceptions due to recombination in the clus ter. Hb C in this family was found on haplotype which differs at two poly morphic sites from the usual Hb C haplotype. Additional two informativepolymorphisms (Taq I/inter gamma and Hpa I/3 beta) confirmed that thebeta C chromosome in this family was not derived from African Black chro mosomes but represents a new mutation. ,2001
1609,Alpha thalassemia is generally considered to be an expression defectcaused mostly by deletions silencing the expression of one or more alphaglobin genes. Although non deletion mutation alpha thalassemia is consid ered rare we frequently observe in our laboratory alpha thalassemia phe notypes induced by points mutation by various mechanisms. A family ofrecent Moroccan origin living in The Netherlands was studied because ofthe persisting microcytic hypochromic anemia observed in a non irondepleted young son. No abnormal hemoglobin components were visible onelectrophoresis or HPLC but the expression unbalance of beta/alpha =1.27 measured in absence of HbH inclusion bodies indicating the deple tion of one alpha gene. No deletion defects were detected by Southern Blotanalysis or by brake point PCR. Amplification and direct sequencingrevealed a normal sequence of both the alpha2 genes and the heterozy gous pattern for a C >T transition at position 119 of the alpha1 genes. TheCCT triplet at position 119 of the alpha gene codes for a proline which islocated at the beginning the H helix of the alpha chain and is therefore afundamental residue in the formation of the secondary structure of thealpha globin chain. Over 200 single amino acid substitutions have beendescribed affecting the homologous alpha1 and alpha2 globin chains mainly inducing detectable abnormal hemoglobin tetramers. The CCT >TCT mutation changing proline 119 to a serine is the first mutant everdescribed at this particular position suggesting that residue 119 might befundamental for dimers and tetramers formation. Indeed no abnormalhemoglobin fraction was detectable in the lysate probably indicating theabsence of tetramers containing the anomalous chain and an early prote olytic degradation of the monomer resulting in the unbalanced beta/alpharatio and in the mild alpha thalassemia phenotype observed in the carriersof this mutation. In spite of the mild character this mutation could generatean intermediate hemolytic anemia (HbH disease) in the progeny of parents with a combination of this point mutation with one of the frequent alphazero deletion defects. ,2001
1610,Beta thalassemia is a prevalent genetic disease in Vietnam. From peoplein all over the world more than 200 different thalassemia mutations inbeta globin gene have been reported so far. The aim of our research is get ting distribution of beta thalassemia mutations in a Vietnamese population. Further more those data will be served for prenatal diagnosis of tha lassemia mutations soon. Using multiplex PCR with control and specificprimers for 6 mutations frameshift codons 41 42( CTTT) codons 71 72(+A) nonsense codon 17(A T) codon 28(A G) codon 29(A G) and IVSII 654(C T) to screening 195 Vietnamese patients. The result shows thatthe mutation at codons 41 42 is the most common i Vietnam (42 6%).Whereas mutations 28 71 72 and IVS II 654 are less frequent (3 6 3 1and 2 0%). 49 beta thalassemia families were performed for those muta tions as well 18 cases a child and mother/father had mutation at codons 41 42 7 cases had mutation at codon 17 3 cases had mutation at codon 29 1 case hadmutation at codon 28 3 cases had mutation at codons 71 72 2 cases had mutation at IVS II 654. One patient had 2 mutations (71 72 from his mother and IVS II 654 fromhis father). ,2001
1611,Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common mitochondrial cytopathy of earlyage (infancy and childhood) and it may result from several defects of mito chondrial enzyme complexes. One of the most frequent form of LS (clas sical form) is associated with cytochrome c oxidase (COX complex IV)deficiency and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. No mutationsin any of 13 polypeptide subunits of human COX have been detected in LSpatients. Recently LS COX locus has been mapped to chromosome 9q34Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 409and mutated SURF1 gene has been identified in LS patients. We present the identification of SURF1 gene mutation in 18 Polish patients with clas sical form of Leigh syndrome. Sequence analysis revealed the presence ofnovel 704T>C transversion (Met235Thr) and two different recurrent dinu cleotide deletions (758delCA 845delCT). 845delCT was identified in 75%of all our patients in homozygote or heterozygote state. Besides onenucleotide 573C>G transversion resulted in silent mutation (Thr191Thr)was detected. Our study confirms the recent observations that SURF1gene is consistently involved in disorders of mitochondrial respiratory chainin patients with typical Leigh syndrome. The study was partially supportedby KBN CMHI Project No. S76/2000. ,2001
1612,X linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an immunodeficiency caused bylymphocyte differentiation block. XLA is caused by mutations in all fivedomains of the gene encoding Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK). The gene islocalised at Xq21.3 Xq22 and consists of 19 exons. There are no frequentmutations in this gene. Point mutations are the most common. We havedeveloped multiplex systems for simultaneous amplification and SSCP analysis of several exons of the BTK gene. DNA samples from 26 unrelat ed patients with XLA were analysed by this method. We have found 15mutations only two of them are described in BTK database. The novelrearrangements mutations from large deletions of some exons up to differ ent missence mutations were detected in different domains of BTK gene. Three of them were found in 6th exon. The correlation between genotypeand clinical features are rather interesting. X linked agammaglobulinemia(XLA) is an immunodeficiency caused by lymphocyte differentiation block. XLA is caused by mutations in all five domains of the gene encoding Bru ton s tyrosine kinase (BTK). The gene is localised at Xq21.3 Xq22 andconsists of 19 exons. There are no frequent mutations in this gene. Pointmutations are the most common. We have developed multiplex systemsfor simultaneous amplification and SSCP analysis of several exons of theBTK gene. DNA samples from 26 unrelated patients with XLA wereanalysed by this method. We have found 15 mutations only two of themare described in BTK database.

1613,The spectrum of mutations in the steroid 21 hydroxylase gene (CYP21B)and the frequency of 11 mutations among 70 patients with different formsof congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) were analyzed by means of PCRanalysis. Each of the CAH forms was characterized by specific pattern ofdiagnostically important mutations. The salt wasting (SW) form of the dis ease was more frequently associated with gene deletion (39%) and the668 13C G mutation in the second intron (23.5%) of CYP21 gene where as the majority of simple virilizing (SV) CAH cases were associated withthe 1172N mutation in exon 4 (23.5%) gene deletion (16.5%) and the 668 13C G mutation (16.5%). Mutations in the steroid 21 hydroxylase genewere detected in 70% of the chromosomes from the patients with the SWand SV forms of CAH respectivly. We investigated 78 chromosomes fromthe patients with nonclassic form (NC) of CAH only in 1.3% mutations(gene deletion) were found. Neither V281L nor P30L mutations commonfor the NC CAH patients from other populations were detected in this study. This result can be explained either by the fact that NC CAH cases in Rus sia are associated with other major mutations or with difficulties in clinicaldiagnostics of nonclassic form in our patients. ,2001
1614, We have analyzed the entire CFTR coding region by DGGE and screenedfor common PRSS 1 (R122H N29I) SPINK 1 (N34S) mutations in a totalof 65 chronic pancreatitis (CP) cases ( idiopathic CP iCP /incl. criteria NEngl J Med 1998 339 653 22 children 32 adults/ hereditary CP hCP/EUROPAC incl. criteria Med Clin North Am 2000 84 575 7 children 4adults/ and compared their frequency to 100 random controls /50F 50M age range 18 45 yrs./). In iCP the frequency of CFTR mutations deltaF508 R117H L997F was increased only in adults (p=0.01) and was associatedwith an increase of the IVS8(T)9/(TG)10 haplotype (p=0.001) and of the125G/C polymorphism (p=0.01) compared to controls. The frequency ofR122H and N29I PRSS 1 mutations was significantly increased in bothchildren/adults (3/22) with hCP (p<0.01) but not in all iCP cases (2/108)compared to controls. However the SPINK 1 N34S mutation was found ata considerable frequency also in controls (4/200 chromosomes) anobservation challenging its previously reported pathogenic potential. Ourdata indicate that mutations in CFTR PRSS 1 genes are associated withiCP/hCP with PRSS 1 alleles being more often observed in early onsetCP. In cases with positive screening results genetic counseling and long term monitoring for the event. development of other cystic fibrosis relatedsymptoms (in iCP) and the adenocarcinoma of pancreas (in hCP) shouldbe provided.

1615,"Venous malformations with glomus cells (glomuvenous malformations)are localized cutaneous lesions of vascular dysmorphogenesis. They areusually sporadic but sometimes familial. Using five families we havemapped the locus VMGLOM to chromosome 1p21 p22. In order to refinethis locus spanning 4 6 Mbp we now studied seven additional families. They exhibited linkage to VMGLOM and the combined LOD score for alltwelve families was 18.41 at q = 0.0 for marker D1S188. We found a dis tinct haplotype shared by seven families comprising seven alleles that arerare in the general population (P < 0.01). This indicated that the haplotypeis identical by descent in all seven families and hence the locus could berefined by inferring ancestral crossovers. Using this approach we posi tioned the causative gene between two markers on the same non chimericYAC of 1.48 Mbp. Positional cloning recently lead to the identification of themutated gene a novel regulator of vascular morphogenesis that we namedglomulin. Mutational analyses verified the common origin of the identifiedhaplotype. (', ') ",2001
1616,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of DNA preamplifica tion for the molecular analyses of a single or few cells. We therefore com pared the efficiency of original primer extension preamplification (PEP) degenerate oligonucleotide primer PCR (DOP) and modified PEP (M PEP) using each of the 5 amniocytes obtained from 50 pregnant women. As a preliminary experiment for the preimplantation genetic diagnosis(PGD) in order to avoid the X linked disorders DMD and SMA we haveamplified X Y centromeric sequences dystrophin gene exon 46 and SMNgene exon 7 from a small aliquot of each whole gemone amplification(WGA) products. Comfirmed with chromosome analysis we determinedthat 25 fetuses had the Y chromosome and the detection rates of PEP DOP and M PEP were 4 68 and 96% in Y specific amplification respec tively. The amplification rates of X specific region were 66 96 100 % inPEP DOP M PEP respectively and 14 52 66 % of dystrophin gene and4 46 74 % of SMN gene. Contaminated DNA sequences and false posi 410 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorderstive for female cells in Y specific PCR were not detected. This study indi cates that the efficiency of M PEP was significantly greater than the othermethods and that M PEP should be used for the diagnosis of fetal inher ited diseases. ,2001
1617,Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder ofcholesterol biosynthesis characterized by facial dysmorphisms mentalretardation and multiple congenital anomalies. The birth prevalence ofSLOS is estimated to be 1 20 000 to 1 40 000 possibly the second mostcommon recessive metabolic disorder after phenylketonuria. The carrierfrequency is calculated to be 1 100 to 1 50. SLOS is caused by mutationsof the D7 sterol reductase (DHCR7) gene. Up to now about forty differentmutations in all translated exons 4 9 have been described. The majority(50%) of the mutations are clustered in exon 9. We present mutationalanalysis of the DHCR7 gene investigated in a new group of Polish patientswith SLOS and in two pregnant women at risk. Five different point muta tions of a nucleotide substitution type W151X in exon 6 (on one allele) L157P in exon 6 (on two alleles) V326L in exon 9 (on six alleles) V338Min exon 9 (on one allele) and IVS8 1 g>c in splice acceptor site (on oneallele) were identified. Mutation V338M is a novel one the other substitu tions are recurrent in Polish and European populations and have beendescribed previously. Three mutations were found in one patient. Analysisof patient s parents revealed the presence of two different mutations onmother s allele. In two families molecular diagnosis of chorionic villiexcluded SLOS in fetuses. These studies were supported in part by KBN Project No.4P05E09118 and the Subsidies for Scientists 2000 Programmeof the Foundation for Polish Science. ,2001
1618,The autosomal recessive Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an inborn disorder of sterol metabolism with characteristic congenital malformationsand dimorphisms. All patients suffer from mental retardation. The gene of7 sterol reductase (DHCR7) responsible for the de novo biosynthesis ofcholesterol have been identified as a SLOS gene by Fitzky B. U. et al(1998). DHCR7 gene is localised on 11q13 and consists of 9 exons. DNAfrom 14 unrelated patients with dubious diagnosis SLOS were analyzed formutation in DHCR7 gene for different diagnostics. Four mutations in 2 fam ilies were revealed. The prenatal diagnostics without proband DNA wasperformed in one family with SLOS. Fetus received chromosome withmutation in 9th exon of DHCR7 gene from his mother and chromosomewithout mutation in 6th exon from father. Prognosis for fetus wasfavourable. Among these 4 mutations one was described by Fitzky B. U. etal (1998) three other were novel. ,2001
1619,To date 711 mutations have been identified in the LDLR gene encodingthe low density lipoprotein receptor in subjects with Familial Hypercholes terolemia. Although genotype/structure function correlations have beensubstantially investigated genotype/phenotype correlations have not beenexplored. Thus we have compiled a database containing standardizeddata for each LDLR mutation and developed the software that providessorting tools and allows optimized multicriteria research[http //www.umd.necker.fr]. The analysis of the 625 point mutations in theUMD LDLR database gives the following information [1] 58% of the muta tions are missense and 17% occur in CpG dinucleotides known to bemutational hot spots [2] although widely distributed throughout the gene there is an excess of mutations in exons 4 and 6 (ligand binding repeats) 7 (EGF like repeat) and 9 (EGF precursor like) [3] there is a deficit ofmutations in exons 10 and 13 (EGF precursor like) 15 (O linked sugar) 16 (transmembrane) 17 and 18 (cytoplasmic) [4] 47% of the small dele tions occur between repeated sequences and can be explained by theslipped mispairing model described by Krawczak and Cooper [5] 68% ofthe mutations in the ligand binding domain affect conserved amino acids involved in LDL binding [6] the functional data available for 183 (29%)mutations indicate 38% of class 2B (transport defective) and 33% of class1 mutations (null alleles) [7] finally the investigation of genotype/pheno type correlations is difficult since the clinical data is usually incomplete inmutation reports. Direct access to the database through the web siteshould facilitate the input of high quality clinical information and shouldovercome this shortage. ,2001
1620,CANP 3 gene consisted of 24 exons is one of 11 different genes in whichmutations cause Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2A) but justdefects of this gene determine considerable part of recessive LGMDcases. Many missense mutations and microdeletions detected in CANP 3gene make difficulties for DNA diagnosis of LGMD. The combination ofPCR analysis and hybridization of PCR products with oligonucleotidemicroarrays may permit to resolve this problem. Information about 326 LGMD patients is collected in computer database MYODYS 2.2 that we created by use common diagnostic criteria and medical documentation about 3900 Russian families with hereditary neu romuscular disorders. DNA samples of 43 individuals from LGMD familieswere obtained and PCR products of several parts of CANP 3 gene (Pm exons 1 2 3 4 5 6 19 20 21 22) were analyzed. 17 and 3 patients withLGMD are showed polymorphism (SSCP) in exon 4 and exon 21 accord ingly. By subsequent sequencing two mutations in exon 4 deletion of 1 bp(550Ã\x98A) and deletion of 15 bp (Ã\x98598 612) were detected. SSCP analysisand allele specific PCR revealed 550Ã\x98A of CANP 3 as common mutationin our group of Russian families with recessive LGMD (57% homo andheterozygous both). In control group (donors from healthy families n=34)one person turned out heterozygous for 550DA. Using computer analysisof exon 4 sequence we synthesized special set of six pairs of oligonu cleotides to detect 6 mutations identified in exon 4 of CANP 3 gene earli er. The microarray was prepared by immobilization of oligonucleotideprobes in gel pads using the previously described technology. Hybridiza tion of DNA samples with this microarray revealed the distinctive discrimi nation between 550DA homo and heterozygous. This approach seems tobe successful for the fast detection of the main part of point mutations inCANP 3 gene. ,2001

1622,Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a group of heterogeneous inherited dis orders usually transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. The diseasephenotype is characterized by various axonemal abnormalities of respira tory cilia and sperm tails leading to bronchiectasis and sinusitis some times associated with situs inversus (Kartagener s syndrome) and malesterility. We have isolated the first gene involved in PCD DNAI1 using acandidate gene approach. To date DNAI1 is the only gene known to beinvolved in PCD it is highly likely that numerous PCD causing genesremain to be identified.

1624,Molecular diagnostic confirmation/exclusion of Marfan syndrome (MFS)through FBN1 gene analysis by single stranded confirmation polymor phism (SSCP) is insensitive time consuming and expensive. Yet it wouldbe valuable for atypical cases and possibly affected family members. Aftersequencing the exon boundaries of the human FBN1 we designed PCRprimers to amplify all FBN1 exons and exon boundaries and screened twosets of patients and control individuals for FBN1 mutations by conforma tion sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) followed by sequencing. The firstset consisted of 46 DNA samples from 12 sporadic and 12 familial caseswith MFS 3 sporadic and 2 familial cases with annuloaortic ectasia (AAE) 1 case with familial ectopia lentis and from 16 control individuals. Thediagnosis was based on clinical evaluation and use of the diagnostic crite ria for MFS (AmJMedGenet 1996 62 417 ). The molecular analysis wasperformed blindly first with CSGE. Sequence variations observed byCSGE were identified by sequencing. The results showed FBN1 mutationsin all patients with MFS and in the patient with ectopia lentis but no muta tions in the patients with AAE or in control individuals. The second set con sisted of 18 patients with MFS and previously detected FBN1 mutations. CSGE followed by sequencing allowed us to characterize all but one of thepreviously detected mutations. Thus the sensitivity and specificity in thesesets were 100 per cent. Thus CSGE followed by sequencing can beoffered as a diagnostic test with high detection rate for confirmation/exclu sion of MFS diagnosis. ,2001
1625,"Approximately one third to one half of individuals with classical Ehlers Danlos syndrome (types I/II) have detectable abnormalities in the genesencoding the proa1(V) (COL5A1) or proa2(V) (COL5A2) chains of type Vcollagen a quantitatively minor component of type I collagen rich fibrils. Electron micrographs of skin from some patients with EDS were reportedto have larger diameter collagen fibrils than control. In general largerdiameter collagen fibrils correlate directly with structural properties (stiff ness and maximum force) and material properties (modulus and maximumstress) of tissues yet dermal tissues of classical EDS patients are friableand dermal scars have apparent reduced mechanical strength. To investi gate this apparent paradox we examined matrix deposition and collagenfibril morphology in long term cultures of fibroblast cell strains that have afourfold difference in the ratio of type V to type I collagen gene expression. Compared to control cells fibroblasts from 2 patients with OI type I due toCOL1A1 haploinsufficiency deposited 46% of hydroxyproline per mg pro tein and EDS cells from 2 patients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiencydeposited 38%. However the EDS cells synthesized approximately thesame amount of total collagen as controls and had similar secreted ratiosof type I/type III collagen as control cells. Average collagen fibril diameterfrom EDS cells was 39.6Ã¢\x80\x93 12.5 nanometers compared to 32.6Ã¢\x80\x936.9 nm forcontrol and 25.1Ã¢\x80\x93 5.2 nm for OI cells. These data indicate that type V col lagen may serve a dual function in dermal tissues. In addition to its posit ed role as a negative regulator of collagen fibril diameter type V collagenmay serve as a rate limiting nucleator of collagen fibrillogenesis in dermis. A reduced rate of collagen fibril formation in the dermis of classical EDSpatients with COL5A1 haploinsufficiency may override any mechanicaladvantage conferred by increased fibril diameter.412 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian DisordersP1588.

Alport syndrome can be caused by mutations in COL4A5 one ofthe six type IV collagen genes. The most common form of the Alport syn drome is an X linked dominant trait that has been associated with the geneof the alpha5 chain of type IV collagen (COL4A5). More than 300 differentmutations have been identified in COL4A5 gene and they appear random ly along the whole gene. We report the first systematic mutation screeningof all 51 exons with boundary intronic sequences of COL4A5 gene by sin gle stranded conformation analysis (SSCA) after amplification of eachexon by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in forty two patientsfrom 16 randomly collected AS suspected families in slovenian population. The nucleotide sequence of all PCR products revealed by the abnormalmobility shift on PCR SSCA was determined by the direct sequencingmethod using dsDNA cycle sequencing system (Perkin Elmer). PCR SSCA of the COL4A5 gene of eight unrelated Alport families showed thepresence of seven different mutations. Seven different mutations wereidentified in 8 families by cycle sequencing. Six of them are to the best ofour knowledge new G669R (GGT>CGT) G325R (GGA>CGA) R266X(CGA>TGA) G811R (GGA>AGA) G319D (GGT>GAT) and 1234+17 Tdel.

1626,Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a subtype of non insulin dependent diabetes characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance andearly age of onset. Several genes are known to or supposed to induceMODY HNF 4a/MODY1 glucokinase/MODY2 HNF 1a/MODY3 IPF1/MODY4 TCF2/MODY5 IB1 IB2 and NeuroD genes. We studied aSwiss family with 12 non insulin dependent diabetic patients over 3 gener ations. The average age of diagnosis was 36 Ã¢\x80\x93 15 years and the averageBMI 25 Ã¢\x80\x93 3 kg/m2. In addition 1 individual had an abnormal oral glucosetolerance test and 2 had gestational diabetes only. All candidate genes butHNF 4a were excluded by linkage analysis using 2 to 4 flanking markers. Direct sequencing of the 14 exons of HNF 4a in 3 patients revealed themissense mutation gtc to atc in exon 4 resulting in V121I. This mutation islocated in the DNA binding domain of HNF 4a a strongly conserved regionacross almost all species. This mutation cosegregates in all the MODYaffected patients and was never observed in 100 control chromosomes. Identification of this missense mutation allowed for the presymptomaticdiagnosis in the young generation. This should improve the medical follow up of the predisposed individuals. ,2001
1627,A large Iranian family with 102 members (8 deceased) from the Lore Tribeof Sirjan Kerman was identified and studied. This kindred composed of 25affected subjects in 16 nuclear families that spans over 11 interconnectinggenerations. Clinical examination of 12 subjects aged between 8 46 yearsrevealed initial presentation of congenital blindness as early as 1 3 monthsof life. Infantile nystagmus keratoconus leukoma and cataracts developedlater in life. Clinical presentation in this kindred is compatible with the diag nosis of Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). DNA extracted from 41 sub jects (including 12 affected) and cDNA synthesized for 6 affected and nor mal members. Highly polymorphic DNA markers from 5 different chromo somes (1 6 14 17 and 19) previously linked to various LCA loci was geno typed in this family.

1628,Isolated CH caused by low TSH synthesis is rarely reported. To date fivedifferent mutations of the TSH ÃÂ§ subunit gene have been identified world wide. The G29R mutation in the CAGYC region of exon 2 of the gene wasidentified in three different Japanese families. The C105T mutation wasidentified in two related Brazilian and two unrelated German families aswell as in one sporadic case from Belgium. Although this mutation appearsto be common in western populations has not so far been detected in anyGreek patient with low TSH hypothyroidism. In our population we haveidentified three different mutations. The first mutation a G to T transversionat nucleotide 94 in exon 2 changing the codon for the 11th aminoacid fromglycine to a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated protein was pre viously reported. Thus far three different Greek families with CH have beenidentified carrying this mutation. Two novel mutations were recently identi fied in exon 3 of the TSH ÃÂ§ subunit gene in two siblings and in one spo radic case. The two siblings were diagnosed at 3 weeks. They both carrya previously undescribed homozygous mutation in exon 3 of the TSH ÃÂ§ subunit gene namely a C to T transition resulting in a premature stop atcodon 49 leading to the formation of a truncated protein. More than half ofthe mature peptide (aminoacids 50 to 118) including the bL3 loop mostpart of the bsheet the seat belt and the carboxyl terminal are absent. It cantherefore be postulated that since functionally important residues for theTSH heterodimer formation are missing no TSH is secreted. The two sib lings had different hormonal and clinical profile. The reason for this differ ential effect of an identical mutation is not apparent. The parents (both het erozygous for the same mutation) denied consaguinity. Nevertheless theyboth originate from a small village. The second mutation is a T to C transi tion resulting in a change at codon 85 from cysteine to arginine. The cys teine residues of all glycoproteins are highly conserved it is thereforespeculated that this mutation results in conformational changes of the ÃÂ§subunit rendering it incapable to form a functional heterodimer with the asubunit. The rarity of reports on defects of the TSH ÃÂ§ subunit gene is unex plained. Is it really a rare genetic defect or does it escape detection? Asexpected this form of CH is not detected by neonatal screening using TSHmethodology. ,2001
1629, hamburg.deMutations in L1CAM lead to X linked disorders including the symptoms hydrocephalus adducted thumbs agenesis or hypoplasia of corpus callo sum spastic paraplegia and mental retardation (L1 disease). Approxi mately 35% of the more than 140 known pathogenic mutations in L1CAM are missense mutations and show some variability in phenotype expres sion which may depend on type and site of the mutation. Rare coding vari ants of unknown biological significance are also known. We established anexperimental model for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the effectsof L1CAM missense mutations by transfecting NIH 3T3 cells either with full length L1 encoding wild type (wt) or mutant constructs. Stable expressionon the cytoplasmic membrane was confirmed by immunocytochemistryand FACS analysis. Western blot analysis revealed bands correspondingto fully processed L1 protein from the wt construct and in addition or pre dominantly aberrant bands in the mutants. Transfected cells were used asPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 413feeder cells for primary neurons prepared from cerebellum of P5 mice. All mutations introduced so far were associated with a significant reduction ofneurite outgrowth measured after 23 hrs of co culturing.

1630,Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy[APECED OMIM 240300] is a monogenic autoimmune disease with auto somal recessive inheritance and no association with the HLA region. Wehave cloned the defective gene AIRE and identified 20 mutations inAPECED patients. Currently we are searching for patient mutations in thepromoter region of AIRE gene. In human and mouse tissues AIRE proteindisplays mostly in nuclei while cytoplasmic and nuclear localization can beobserved in transfected tissue culture cells. Further we aim to study thedistribution of AIRE in differentiated neurons. In human AIRE protein isexpressed in immunologically relevant tissues. Our results indicate thatmouse Aire protein is expressed in specific thymal cells as well as in sev eral other immunological and nonimmunological tissues. We have alsoshown that AIRE forms homodimers through HSR domain and acts as apowerful transcriptional coactivator. These functions are defective in cer tain patient mutations found in this domain. Our goal is to identify thegenes regulated by AIRE and to characterize the transcriptional regulationof the AIRE gene expression. Interestingly we have identified putativetranscription factors binding to the Aire promoter. ,2001
1631,"Non syndromic cardiac septation defects are common yet the responsiblegenetic changes remain uncharacterised. However mutations in theCSX/Nkx2 5 gene encoding a cardiac specific homeobox transcription fac tor have been reported to cause atrial septal defects (ASD) associated withatrioventricular (AV) conduction block. The CSX gene is expressed in car diac muscle during embryonic fetal and adult life and its Drosophilaortholog tinman is essential for the formation of the dorsal vessel. Target ed homozygous disruption of Nkx2 5 in mice causes lethality due to failureof heart looping. In man eleven mutations in the CSX gene have beendescribed in individuals with variable cardiac phenotypes. The majority hasASD and/or atrioventricular conduction defects. In addition ventricularseptal defects (VSD) tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) subvalvular aortic stenosis ventricular hypertrophy pulmonary atresia mitral valve abnormalities andEbstein s anomaly are observed. Along our studies on non syndromicfamilial cardiopathies we have collected two families with some memberspresenting ASD and AV block. In both families we identified a novel CSXmutation in the homeodomain Variable expressivity in the phenotype wasobserved in one of the families. In the first generation pacemakers havebeen implanted in the second two unaffected carriers and two memberswith ASD secundum (ASDII) and TOF were identified. Finally in the thirdgeneration members with ASDII VSD pulmonary stenosis atrioventricu lar septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were observed. Thusthe phenotypes caused by CSX mutations vary from non expression severe arrhythmia to TOF and PDA. Importantly mutation carriers do notnecessarily present AV block at young age. (', ') ",2001
1632,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most com mon hereditary renal disease. The disease is caused by mutations ofPKD1 and PKD2 genes though in several ADPKD families the PKD1and/or PKD2 linkage was not found. DNA presymptomatic diagnosis is per formed in our referential laboratory using highly polymorphic microsatellitemarkers for DNA linkage analysis. According to European recommenda tions CW2 (D16S663) 16AC2.5 (D16S291) CW3D (16S664) and KG8 areused for linkage to PKD1 gene and D4S231 D4S414 D4S1534 andD4S1563 for linkage to PKD2 gene. Presymptomatic DNA diagnosis wasperformed in 160 unrelated ADPKD families. Linkage analysis gave strongevidence in favor of linkage to PKD1 in 60 (38%) families and linkage toPKD2 in 8 (5%) families. In 92 (58%) families mutation in either testedgenes could not be excluded by linkage analysis. The direct detection ofPKD2 mutation is performed in proved PKD2 families using heteroduplexanalysis (HA) and sequencing.

1633, mrs.frA large number of paroxysmal neuromuscular and cardiac disorders arenow known to be channelopathies. Of particular interest are the syndromesin which cardiac and neuromuscular symptoms concur as they representpowerful tools to identify common pathways involved in cardiac and neu romuscular functioning. Andersen syndrome is such a condition in whichcardiac arrythmias (long QT) and periodic paralysis are associated. Spo radic as well as familial cases have been reported but no gene has beenidentified so far. Several long QT syndromes (LQT) have been defined ona genetic basis. To date six long QT genes have been localized five ofthem (LQT1 3 5 6) are now identified and encode potassium or sodiumchannels. The LQT4 gene has been mapped to chromosome 4q25 q27 butthe critical region extends over 18 cM and the gene remains unknown. Onepatient with Andersen syndrome was detected. Cytogenetic studiesrevealed the existence of a de novo reciprocal translocationt(4 12)(q26 p12). Co localization of the breakpoint at 4q26 with the criticalarea defined for LQT4 syndrome at 4q25 q27 strongly suggested that bothsyndromes could be caused by different alterations of the same gene. Thetranslocation breakpoint thus represented a very powerful tool to identifythe disease gene. FISH experiments with YACs and PACs showed that thetranslocation breakpoint at 4q26 lies in a 120 kb area entirely comprisedwithin the LQT4 critical region. Work is in progress in order to identify junc tion fragments from cosmid clones encompassing the breakpoint. Molecu lar cloning of the breakpoint should lead to identification of a gene for boththe Andersen syndrome and the LQT4 syndrome. Identification of thisgene will be an important step towards the understanding of both periodicparalysis and long QT syndromes. As the gene is likely to contribute theQT interval variability between normal individuals it could also play amajor role in normal cardiac functioning. Once the gene is identified large scale genetic studies could be performed to test the involvement of thegene in various cardiac arrythmias. Moreover functional studies and theestablishment of cellular and animal models will represent powerful toolsto test various pharmacological and genetic therapeutic approaches aswell as to better understand normal cardiac and muscular functioning. ,2001

The AS locus was assigned to a 14.9 cM region on 2p13 p14 by linkage analysis further restricted to a 6.1 cM intervalbetween markers D2S327 and D2S286. We observed two AS brothers born to non consanguineous healthy parents. Pregnancy and deliverywere uneventful in both cases. Patient 1 developed photophobia and bilat eral nystagmus at the age of 2 months. From the age of 3 months he suf fers from bronchial asthma poorly responsive to conventional therapy. Atthe age of 3 years a diffuse pigmentary retinopathy was evident in botheyes. Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) showed a conductive delay. Theelectroretinogram (ERG) was strongly altered. Patient 2 presented withphotophobia bilateral nystagmus and dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of2 years. A diffuse pigmentary retinopathy was found at the ophtalmologicalexamination. At present both patients are obese. Neither alterations in glu cose metabolism nor hearing loss are present. Mitochondrial DNA analysisfor common mutations underlying NARP and Leber s hereditary optic neu ropathy was negative. We tested two genes both located in the AS criticalregion Rab 1 and rhotekin respectively which appear good candidates forAS on the basis of their physiological functions. By direct sequencing of thecoding region of Rab 1 and of the coding region and exon intron junctionsof rhotekin no mutations were found except for one polymorphic changein Rab 1 gene. This change is located downstream the termination codonof the gene. ,2001
1635,DNA interstrand crosslinks are critical lesions for the mammalian cell sincethey affect both strands and block both transcription and replication theirrepair is essential for survival. Although the involvement of nucleotide exci sion repair (NER) proteins has been implicated little is known about themechanisms of crosslink repair in human cells. One approach to under standing this cellular process is the identification of crosslink repair genesby exploiting mutant mammalian cells with particular sensitivity towardsagents which cause DNA crosslinks such as Mitomycin C and photoacti vated psoralens. Cells from patients with the autosomal recessive disorderFanconi anaemia (FA) are particularly sensitive to these agents and arepresumed to have defects in the crosslink repair pathway. Similarly arange of hamster cells is available selected for crosslink sensitivity. Thesecells can be assigned to complementation groups on the basis of cellfusion and thus define separate genes in the crosslink repair pathway. Dis ruption of the yeast gene SNM1 (PSO2) results in hypersensitivity towardsDNA crosslinking agents and homologues of this gene are presumablyinvolved in crosslink repair in mammalian cells too. We have examined theability of the yeast SNM1 gene to complement the defect in 4 crosslinksensitive hamster cell lines and in human FA D2 cells in terms of survivaland chromosome damage. One hamster cell mutant was partially but sig nificantly corrected after gene transfer suggesting that the hamster SNM1gene is mutated in these cells. Three human SNM1 homologues havebeen identified and are being examined for complementation of thesecells. Mutation analysis in FA cells from complementation groups B and D1has so far excluded the involvement of human SNM1 in this disorder. ,2001
1636,We present the genetic study of 11 patients affected by the Unverricht Lundborg disease (ULD) and 3 relatives with isolated seizures extractedfrom 8 families and originating from La Reunion island. Ten subjects har bour the typical ULD mutation including one with isolated seizures ahomozygous expansion of a dodecamer repeat in the cystatin B (CSTB)gene promoter beyond 40 repetitions. Clinically those cases are very sim ilar with the typical photosensible myoclonus associated with generalisedtonic clonic seizures (GTCS) cerebellar involvement and mild mentaldeterioration. The mean age at onset is 9.6 years (range 5 to 21) with amean disease duration of 19.7 years (all patients are alive range 4 to 39).We observed a founder effect as the 10 patients with the homozygousexpansion present the same haplotype with homozygous alleles for 7markers spanning less than 1 cM of genomic DNA (D21S1890 D21S1885 D21S2040 D21S1259 D21S1912 PFKL D21S171 from centromere totelomere) bounded by GT10 and D21S1446. We also confirmed thegenetic instability since the expansion size was variable (mean 55.3 range 48 to 63) despite a probable single common ancestor. ,2001
1637, mrs.frBenign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) is an autosomal dominantepileptic disorder characterized by convulsions with onset at age 3 12months and a favorable outcome. BFIC had been linked to chromosome19q while the ICCA syndrome associating BFIC with paroxysmal dyski nesias had been linked to chromosome 16p12 q12 in several familiesfrom France. Association of BFIC with paroxysmal dyskinesias seemsquite frequent as many additional families of diverse ethnic backgroundwith similar syndrome have been linked to the chromosome 16 ICCAregion. Moreover one large pedigree with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyski nesias only has also been linked to the same genomic area. This raisedthe possibility that families with pure BFIC could be linked to chromosome16 as well. Seven families with BFIC inherited as an autosomal dominanttrait were collected in Argentina and France. Genotyping was performedwith markers at chromosome 19q and 16p12 q12. While chromosome 19qcould be excluded evidence for linkage in the ICCA region was found witha maximum two point LOD score at 3.32 for markers D16S3131 and SPN. This result definitely proves that human chromosome 16p12 q12 is a majorgenetic locus underlying BFIC and/or paroxysmal dyskinesias in affectedpatients and families. The peculiar phenotype displayed by one homozy gous patient suggests that the great intra familial variability of the ICCAsyndrome could be sustained by modifying genetic factors. ,2001
1638,Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene defects have been recently reported as a majorcause of the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) associated with conductionsystem disease. To assess whether the DCM with conduction system dis ease is associated with LMNA gene defects we screened the 12 exon ofthe gene in 5 familial DCMs with atrio ventricular (A V) block. We identified5 novel LMNA mutations in the five DCM families and first documented thecorresponding ultrastructural morphologic defect in the nuclear membraneof the cardiac myocytes. Three mutations are missense A423G in theexon 1 of the cDNA (K97E) C702T in the exon 3 (R190W) and G1083A inthe exon 6 (E327K). One is a non sense mutation G465T of the cDNA E111X predicting a truncated protein of 110 aminoacids and one is a 4 bpinsertion duplicating CTGC at 2869 in the exon 9. In all probands and oneaffected relative the ultrastructural study of the endomyocardial biopiesshowed structural defects of the nuclear membranes consisting of focaldelamination of the inner and outer membranes with bleb formation. Thesefeatures were absent in 50 EMB from DCM patients without conductionsystem disease proven by molecular analysis as non related with LMNAgene defects. The ultrastructural changes of the nuclear membrane arespecifically associated with LMNA defects and combined with the conduc tion system disease constitute useful markers for successful identificationof LMNA gene defects. ,2001
1639,In humans combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) has beenlinked with rare abnormalities in genes encoding pituitary specific tran scription factors. Very recently we have described the first moleculardefects of LHX3 a gene encoding a member of the LIM homeodomainproteins the murine counterpart of which having been shown to be neces sary for anterior pituitary development. LHX3 consists of seven exons withexons 2 3 and 4 and 5 encoding the LIM1 LIM2 and homeo domains respectively. One of the patients born to a consanguineous union dis played a complete deficit in all but one (adrenocorticotropin) anterior pitu itary hormones and a rigid cervical spine associated with a secondaryenlargement of the anterior pituitary as documented by MRI. Screening ofLHX3 had revealed a homozygous 23 bp deletion involving the last 3bases of exon 3 and the adjacent splice donor site. To evaluate the func tional consequences of this small deletion we have studied expressionLHX3 transcripts of the mutated allele by means of in vitro transcription. This analysis demonstrated the shift of the normal LHX3 splicing pathwaytowards an exon 3 deleted transcript. If translated the exon skipping eventwould result in a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon. The mutantLHX3 protein would lack both the LIM2 and the homeo domains. In vitroexpression of the recombinant mutant protein in CHO cells showed that itwas unable to transactivate the bTSH promoter. These functional assays which are consistent with loss of function of the mutant LHX3 protein raisethe question of the mechanism underlying the secondary occurrence of theenlarged anterior pituitary documented in the patient. ,2001
1640,Greater than 99% of individuals clinically diagnosed with achondroplasiahave been shown to have the same amino acid substitution (G380R) in thetransmembrane region of the FGFR3 gene. We present a newborn malewith physical and radiographic studies consistent with achondroplasia. Thepatient experienced severe episodes of apnea in the perinatal period thatcontinued until 10 months of age. Standard diagnostic techniques did notdetect either reported point mutation responsible for causing the G380Rsubstitution. Fluorescent sequencing of exon 10 encompassing the trans membrane region of FGFR3 failed to show any variations from normal. Additional regions known to have point mutations in other FGFR3 relatedskeletal dysplasias were also analyzed. Analysis demonstrated a novel Ato T transversion at nucleotide 835 in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene in thispatient. This missense mutation substitutes a cysteine for serine at aminoacid 279 (S279C) in the extracellular region of the FGFR3 protein. Twoother mutations (R248C and S249C) that create cysteine residues in thisregion have been previously associated with cases of Thanatophoric dys plasia type I. To date only one other mutation (Y278C) affecting the extra cellular domain of FGFR3 has been reported to be associated with anachondroplasia phenotype. These two patients demonstrate that exon 7 in FGFR3 is a strong candidate for mutational analysis in individuals with theclinical diagnosis of achondroplasia that have been shown to have a nor mal FGFR3 transmembrane domain. ,2001
1641, wuerzburg.deIn many cases of a classical Saethre Chotzen syndrome (acrocephalosyn dactyly type III MIM #101400) the TWIST gene encoding a basic helix loop helix transcription factor is the mutational target. In addition to thecraniofacial features of this autosomal dominant syndrome there are(often subtle) limb anormalities like cutaneous syndactyly of hands andfeet clinodactyly and/or broad halluces with valgus deviation. World wideand in our own cohort of more than 30 patients many private TWIST muta tions were found. About 66% were stop frameshift or large deletion muta tions. Haploinsufficiency appears to be be the pathogenic mechanisminvolved. In a group of patients with no clear diagnosis we found threeprobands not giving satisfaction to the clinical criteria but harbouring aTWIST sequence variation. There was the mother of a boy with trigono cephaly being not affected herself who carried an in frame deletion261del21 her son with trigonocephaly do not have the mutation. In a boywith an isolated sagittal craniosynostosis a Ser201Tyr missense mutationwas detected the unaffected father carried the same mutation. Bothsequence variants were not found in more than three hundred controlchromosomes. We conclude that there are rare silent sequence variationsin the TWST gene defining functional less important domains. ,2001
1642,ABSTRACT Holt Oram syndrome is characterized by congenital cardiacdefects and upper limb anomalies. Mutations of the TBX5 gene cause thiscondition. Intrafamilial phenotypic variability is well documented but etiol ogy is clear. Here we report on a set of monozygotic (MZ) twins with HoltÃ¢\x80\x94Oram syndrome. Monozygosity was confirmed by DNA microsatelliteanalysis. Both twins carried a one basepair de novo deletion mutation inTBX5 which leads to a frameshift and predicts a premature termination ofTBX5 protein. The twins shared concordant and complex cardiac defectsincluding secundum ASD a large membranous VSD multiple musculardefects pulmonic narrowing and mild tricuspid regurgitation. However their limb defects are discordant. Skeletal X rays show one twin hasabsence of thumbs bilaterally hypoplastic radial bones and hooked clavi cles and a bifid rib. The other twin has similar anomalies on her right buta thumb is present on the left though distal metacarpal and phalanx arehypoplastic. This genotype phenotype disparity suggests that the geneticbackground might play a important role in the intrafamilial cardiac pheno typic variability observed in Holt Oram syndrome. Factors other thangenetic background such as blood supply or the position of fetus in uterusmay also contribute to limb anomalies. Here we propose a monoallelicexpression model to explain the discordance. ,2001
1643, freiburg.deCampomelic dysplasia (CD) a skeletal malformation syndrome with XYsex reversal usually leads to death in the neonatal period (MIM 114290).CD is caused by heterozygous de novo mutations in and around the devel opmental regulatory gene SOX9 that encodes a transcription factor of 509amino acids with a central DNA binding domain and a C terminal transac tivation domain. Some 29 missense nonsense frameshift and splicemutations in SOX9 have been described that scatter over the entire cod ing region. No significant mutational hotspot has emerged but for the non sense mutation Y440X present in three independent cases. We have iden tified the Y440X mutation in 5 out of 38 additional unpublished CD caseswith proven SOX9 mutations. This mutation thus accounts for about 10%of SOX9 coding region mutations in CD. The TAC tyrosine codon at posi tion 440 is mutated to either TAG (5 cases) or TAA (3 cases) resulting inloss of an RsaI site allowing for simple diagnosis. As previously shown thetruncated SOX9 protein resulting from the Y440X mutation retains sometransactivation potential and may be regarded as a milder mutant allele as 5 of the 8 patients survived the neonatal period. ,2001
1644,Brachydactyly type B (BDB) is an autosomal dominant skeletal disorder characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of distal phalanges and nails. Recent ly heterozygous mutations of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase ROR2within a distinct segment directly after the tyrosine kinase (TK) domainhave been shown to cause BDB. We report four novel and one previouslydescribed mutation in ROR2 (three frame shifts one splice mutation onenonsense mutation) in six BDB families. The mutations predict truncationof the protein immediately before and after the TK. Patients affected withdistal mutations exhibit a more severe phenotype than those with proximalmutations. Our analysis includes an individual with homozygous BDB witha mutation before the TK showing extensive hypoplasia of phalanges metacarpals/metatarsals and anonychia. Moreover vertebral anomalies brachymelia of arms and a ventricular septal defect are present in thispatient and reminiscent of Robinow syndrome which is also caused byROR2 mutations. The BDB phenotype and the localization of BDB muta tions suggest a mutational effect that cannot be explained by simple hap loinsufficiency and is distinct from that in Robinow syndrome. ,2001
1645,Alagille syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities of liver heart eyes vertebrae and facialfeatures. The minimal estimated frequency is 1 70 000 live births. AGSphenotype is caused by mutations of the JAG1 gene located on chromo some 20p12. The JAG1 gene spans 36 kb and consists of 26 exons encoding a 5 5 kb transcript. The product of the gene is a ligand in theNotch signaling pathway. The purpose of our study was to identify JAG1gene mutations in the next group of Polish patients with AGS. We are cur rently studying seven patients. We have detected five DNA alternations byagarose electrophoresis SSCP and HA analyses. DNA sequencingrevealed presence of two novel mutations in the JAG1 gene. One of themwas a 7 nucleotide deletion in exon 2 (codons 58 60). The other mutationwas a substitution G to A in exon 4 (Cys187Tyr). In both cases identifiedmutations appeared de novo. Besides a transversion C to G in exon 22resulting in an amino acid substitution (Pro871Arg) known polymorphism was identified in a proband and his mother .

1646,"Mutations in the JAGGED1 gene encoding a ligand of the NOTCH recep tors are responsible for Alagille syndrome (AGS) a polymalformative dis order. SSCP and heteroduplex analysis have identified JAGGED1 muta tions in 65% of patients with AGS. More than 200 such mutations havebeen described. We used RT PCR and sequencing to study JAGGED1transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 9 patients with AGS withoutknown mutations. Mutations were identified in 3 of them resulting in 2 non sense mutations and a deletion at an exon intron boundary. Thus analysisof JAGGED1 transcripts can identify mutations not detected by SSCP. For5 other patients complete sequencing of the RT products revealed nomutation but the presence of heterozygous polymorphisms suggest thatboth alleles were equally transcribed. For 2 patients with previously identi fied splice mutations transcript analysis revealed the effects of thesemutations at the RNA level mutations in the donor sites of introns 21 and25 are responsible for deletion of exons 20 and 24 respectively. Theseresults demonstrate that RNA analysis is a very useful tool for identifyingmutations which SSCP cannot. It is informative about the stability and thesplicing of the transcripts. However it cannot be used as a routine proce dure because lymphoblastoid cell lines are not available for every patientwith AGS. ', ' ",2001

O. Ospedali Galliera Genoa I', 'Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (FHC) is a condition with a preva lence in the general population of about 1/500 and transmitted as autoso mal dominant trait. The disease is a primary abnormality of the myocardi um and is morphologically characterised by a hypertrophied and non dilat ed left ventricle. The clinical course of the disease is heterogeneous patients may remain asymptomatic some develop severe symptoms ofheart failure others die suddenly and unexpectedly often in the absence ofprevious symptoms. Molecular investigations have identified FHC causingmutations in nine cardiac contractile proteins b myosin heavy chain (b MHC) myosin binding protein C (MyBP C) cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) a tropomyosin (a TM) the two myosin light chain genes cardiac troponin I(TNNI3) a cardiac actin (ACTC) and cardiac Titin (TTN). Genotype phe notype correlation is crucial to understand the natural history of the diseaseand to assess the potential impact of a genetic diagnosis on the identifica tion and management of patients at high risk of sudden death. Due to thelarge size of the major genes involved in the disease our previous workhas been done mainly on part of one gene the b MHC. The recent avail ablility of the DHPLC technology has inproved the screening of mutationsthat is now more efficient and faster. We analysed the coding sequence ofthe three major genes (b MHC MyBP C and TNNT2) in twelve unrelatedItalian patients with FHC. PCR reactions were performed using specificprimers and conditions. Subsequently DHPLC analysis (denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography) was carried out on the WaveTM DNAFragment Analysis System (Transgenomic Cheshire UK). DNA fragmentelution profiles were displayed using the Transgenomic WAVEMAKER TMsoftware. Chromatograms were analysed and amplified fragments show ing alterations were confirmed and identified by automated bi directionalsequencing (MWG Biotech Germany).

Multiple heterozygous mutations inseveral ion channel genes (KvLQT1 HERG SCN5A KCNE1 and KCNE2) have been shown to cause autosomal dominant LQT. Autosomalrecessive LQT which is associated with deafness has been shown tooccur with homozygous mutations in KvLQT1 or KCNE1 in JLNS familiesin which QTc prolongation was inherited as a dominant trait. Recently anAmish JLNS family has been reported with QTc prolongation inherited asan incomplete dominant and deafness inherited as a recessive trait. In vitrobiochemical and functional studies indicate that the KvLQT1 C terminusfunctions as an assembly domain for KvLQT1 subunits. In this study afamily with clinical evidence of JLNS was analyzed for mutations by use ofsingle strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysesfor mutation screening in KvLQT1 gene. Novel compound heterozygousnonsense mutations R423X / Q435X in the C terminus of KvLQT1 wereidentified in both affected dizygotic twins both the parents and a siblingeach carried only one of the mutant alleles and were asymptomatic withmodestly prolonged QTc intervals (.46 .50 and .45 s. respectively). Thesetwo nonsense mutations lead to premature termination C terminus withtruncation of the postulated assembly domain. Our results show that novelcompound heterozygous nonsense mutations in C terminus of KvLQT1cause JLNS. ,2001
1650,Naxos disease (ND) is an autosomal recessive form of arrhythmogenicright ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) which co segregates with palmo plantar keratoderma and woolly hair. We mapped the locus for ND to17q21 where the gene for plakoglobin is located. Plakoglobin is a keycomponent of desmosomes and adherens junctions including those inheart and skin. The human gene sequence was ascertained by RT PCR and analysis in affected individuals showed that all carried a homozygous2 base pair deletion. This mutation produces a frameshift which terminatesthe protein prematurely altering the last 5 amino acids in the 13th armadil lo repeat and truncating the C terminal domain by 56 residues. The find ing that desmosomal molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of Naxos disease suggests that defects in cell junction integrity may be important inARVC. The recent discovery that recessive mutations in desmoplakin alsocause cardiomyopathy (Norgett et al Hum Mol Genet 200 9 2761 2766)supports this hypothesis. Since the cardiac phenotypes in recessive anddominant ARVC are very similar it could be that other proteins in the celladhesion complex present themselves as good candidates for the morecommon form of the disorder. ,2001
1651,Alleles ahrb and ahrd occur in inbred strains of mice C57BL and DBA/2 respectively. They are linked with differences in susceptibility to the toxicand carcinogenic effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). TheC57BL ahrd ahrd mice strain congenic with the C57BL ahrb ahrb has beengenerated in our laboratory after 10 backcrosses each followed by the418 Posters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disordersselection. Here we describe the transgeneration transmission of the stud ied alleles in cross breeding between the parent C57BL ahrb ahrb and thecongenic C57BL ahrd ahrd strains. The in vivo exposure of animals to thetoxic concentrations of cigarette smoke during the period of pairing and theearly pregnancy was shown by us to affect the fertility of ahrd males togreater extend than that of the ahrb males. The transmission of the ahrband ahrd alleles was assessed by genotyping the STR polymorphism atD12Mit2 locus linked with the ahr gene (the length of PCR products of theD12Mit2 alleles is 132 and 149 nucleotides respectively). It was found that depending on the sex of the progeny the linkage disequilibrium may occurin favor of the either allele. In the progeny of the heterozygous mothers(ahrb ahrd) the sex ratio was distorted in favor of the males and decreasedfrequency of ahrb allele was noted among the females. Following the cig arette smoke exposure the allele specific toxic effects on the fertility com bine with the effects on the alleles disequilibrium in progeny. ,2001
1652,In a family without prior haemophilia history a patient was diagnosed ashaving severe haemophilia A (FVIII C < 1U/ml). The intron 22 inversionwas negative. Mutation screening of the entire coding and flanking intron ic sequences of FVIII gene was performed. Results only revealed lack ofamplification of exon 26 indicating that partial deletion of the FVIII genewas the molecular defect in this family. His sister had a low FVIIIC level strongly suggesting she was carrier for haemophilia . However FVIIIC wasnormal in other female members and their carrier status could not be eas ily determined. A specific FVIII gene dosage by duplex real time PCR wasdeveloped in order to determine wether one or two copies of exon 26 werepresent. Relative quantitation was expressed as a ratio between the copiesnumber of FVIII exon 26 sequences and copies of a reference autosomalgene copies number. Twelve samples from non haemophilia families weretested as controls. Ratios study indicates that two clear non overlappingpopulations can be identified a ratio of 1.06 +/ 0.06 (n=6) was found forfemale individuals while it was 0.51 +/ 0.01 (n=6) for males demonstrat ing the efficiency of the method. Four independent analysis of relativefemale members revealed a mean ratio of 0.46 and 0.57 for the patient smother and sister respectively. Therefore they were both carrier for theFVIII exon 26 deletion. Using the same approach other female membersof the same family were tested and their status easily determined. ,2001
1653,Two variants of the MTHFR gene produced by transitions 677(C>T) and1298 (A>C) occur at high frequencies (0.1 0.37 and 033 respectively) inthe studied populations. In spite of this no case of combination of these twomutations on the same chromosome was found by authors studying thissubject (van der Put et al. 1998). It may be presumed that the recombina tion between the polymorphic sites separated by 620 bp distance will notonly be a rare event but also should increase the pathogenicity of the newallele with consequent elimination of the cases. Both polymorphic transi tions were studied by PCR RFLP. The PCR products encompassing677(C>T) mutation was 198bp and that including 1298(A>C) 163bp. Theproducts were cleaved with HinfI and MboII respectively. The doublymutated allele MTHFR cis 677T 1298C found in Polish population seemsto confirm that the disruption of the function associated with this recombi nation exceeds the additivity of the defects. In the studied person the dou bly mutated allele of MTHFR is paired with MTHFR 1298C on the secondchromosome and associated with the spina bifida at the level between L4and nan,2001
1654,Twenty seven patients from 23 families ( 17 Italian 2 Japan 1 Moroccan 1 Greek 1 Iraqui and 1 Pakistan 37 independent alleles) affected by lysin uric protein intolerance (MIM 222700 LPI) were studied for SLC7A7 genemutations. Thirty two of 37 independent alleles (86.5 %) were character ized. Fourteen mutations were identified by SSCP analysis and directsequencing of all SLC7A7 exons. Nine mutations (M1L M50K T188I Y457X 197del543 455delCTCT 786insT IVS6G >T and del ex4) werefound in single families. Only 1625insATCA W242X 1425delCTCT IVS3+1G >A and S386R mutations were identified in more than one inde pendent family. Most mutations are located in the SLC7A7 coding region except for two splicing mutations. Genotypes were completely defined in30 patients a single mutant allele was characterized in two patients. Fortwo patients who received the LPI diagnosis on the basis of clinical andlaboratory criteria no mutation was found in the SLC7A7 coding region(after sequencing of exons and intron exon junctions). Conclusions 1)strong allelic variability is observed in non Finnish LPI patients if comparedto Finnish LPI patients where a single mutation was found 2) this allelicvariability is more evident in Southern Italy where 9 different mutationswere detected 3) further studies (e.g. characterization of the promoter) areneeded to understand the molecular bases of the LPI like phenotype seenin patients without mutations of the SLC7A7 coding region.

1655,Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterised bydiverse clinic symptoms. This extreme phenotypic heterogeneity is alsoassociated to a genetic heterogeneity. At least seven complementationgroups (A to F) have been identified and their relative prevalence varieswidely among the ethnical backgrounds. The association of vertebraldefects anal atresia tracheo esophageal fistula renal malformation radialray defects cardiovascular defects other limb abnormalities genital malfor mations and hydrocephalus (VACTERL H) has emerged as a unique syn drome frequently associated to FA particularly to the mutation IVS4 + 4A >T in the FANCC gene. A regional FA register in the state of Rio de Janeiro Brazil was started since 1991 comprising 48 confirmed FA patients. Two FAcases were selected based on the severe phenotype described as VAC TERL H. Both patients had a conspicuous increased chromosomal insta bility in lymphocyte cultures exposed to DEB. Genomic DNA was extractedand a 131bp fragment across the intronic region of the IVS4 + 4A >T muta tion was amplified by PCR and then sequenced. Neither patients carriedthis mutation. The clinical overlap of FA with other malformation syndromespoints to the wide clinical spectrum of FA to which the clinician should beaware and promptly confirm the diagnosis by the cytogenetic diagnosticDEB test or using a known FA mutation panel. However the genetic het erogeneity of FA may impose several obstacles in establishing a diagnos tic molecular protocol since different phenotypes in FA from different eth nical backgrounds have been described carrying the same mutation. Wedemonstrated that the severe clinic phenotype of FA characterised asVACTERL H does not correlate with the IVS4 + 4A >T mutation in twoBrazilian FA cases.(Finantial support FAPERJ) ,2001
1656,Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized bytoxic accumulation of copper in the liver and subsequently in the brain andother organs. To date more than 150 WD causing mutations have beenidentified. They are mostly missense mutations but also nonsense inser tion/deletion and splice site mutations. Herein we report the RNA analysisfor four WD mutations that occur in the consensus sequence of the donoror the acceptor splice in exons 4 8 13 and 14. RT PCR was performed onpatient s total RNA extracted from peripheral lymphocytes and on normalcontrol s RNA extracted from peripheral lymphocytes or liver biopsies using appropriate primers for a first round PCR reaction followed fromnested PCR. The 1707+3 insT found in compound heterozygosity with anunknown mutation in a patient of Greek origin resulted to skipping of exon4 that contains Cu5 and created a downstream stop codon at aa position609. The 2866 6 T >G also found in compound heterozygous state with anunknown mutation in a patient of Italian origin resulted to defective RNAprocessing i.e. in frame exon skipping by removing exon 13 that codes forTm6 the predicted ion channel and exon skipping of both 13 and 14 exonthat codes for part of the large ATP loop where different critical functional ly protein regions reside. The 2122 8 T >G was detected in homozygosityin an Italian WD patient. The alterated RNA processing due this substitu tion resulted to removal exon 8 by exon skipping and activation of a cryp tic splice site thus adding 23 nucleotides to exon 8 that creates a frameshiftand a downstream stop codon at position 722. The 3061 12 T >A detectedin a patient of Spanish origin in compound heterozygosity with a missensemutation results in an in frame skipping of exon 14 removing part of thelarge ATP loop where different critical regions for protein function reside. ,2001
1657,The SLC12A3 gene encodes the thiazide sensitive NaCl cotransporter(NCCT) expressed in the apical membrane of the distal convoluted tubuleof the kidneys. NCCT consists of 1021 aminoacids organized in 12 trans membrane domains with the amino and carboxy terminals located intra cellularly. Inactivating mutations of this gene give rise to Gitelman s Syn drome (GS) inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. We have searchedfor mutations in the SLC12A3 gene in a group of italian patients with typi cal clinical features of GS (hypokalemia metabolic alkalosis hypomagne semia and hypocalciuria). All coding regions (26 exons) with their intron exon boundaries were analysed using the PCR and SSCP techniques. Samples with abnormal migration pattern were sequenced bidirectionally. In 21 patients we identified 19 different mutations that were evenly distrib uted along the gene without any hot spot for mutations. Sixteen of theseare novel variants including missense and splice site mutations onedeletion and one deletion insertion R158Q T163M A166E W172R G374V G463E A464T R642G S615W S615L R852S R958G C985Y 531 2A >G fs 697 >X724 fs 707 > nan,2001
1658,Gaucher Disease (GD) the most prevalent sphingolipid storage disorder inhumans is caused by a recessively inherited deficiency of the enzyme glu cocerebrosidase. More than 100 mutations have been described in the glu cocerebrosidase gene causing GD. Some of them are complex alleles bearing several mutations present in the highly homologous pseudogene due to crossover or gene conversion events between the gene and thepseudogene. The most frequent complex allele in GD is RecNciI definedby the presence of mutations L444P A456P and V460V. We analysedpatients who carried the L444P mutation and checked for the presence ofthe other two mutations. In total we studied DNA samples from 24 unrelat ed Spanish and 37 unrelated Argentinian patients by Southern blot PCRand sequencing. The molecular analysis showed three distinct Southernpatterns for RecNciI alleles. Two of these patterns correspond to allelesgenerated by either a crossover or a gene conversion event. The third pat tern which involves a new genomic rearrangement is currently beingcharacterised. Other recombinant alleles were also studied. A particularcase of a patient who bears a new complex allele due to a recombinationin intron 2 of the glucocerebrosidase gene was analysed and the recombi nation site was narrowed down to 18 nucleotides. ,2001
1659,The mutational screening of over 50 Spanish Gaucher disease patientsallowed the identification of 95% of the mutant alleles some of which werenew. In order to characterize the resulting enzyme these mutant alleleswere expressed in an improved baculovirus system. The new method gen erates recombinant baculovirus relaying on site specific transposition inmodified E.coli cells and allows selection of recombinant baculovirus. Inparticular mutations P391L N392I and I402T were studied. MutationP391L was found in a type 1 patient in heterozygosity with mutationN370S. Mutation N392I was identified in a type 2 patient in heterozygositywith mutation L444P. And mutation I402T was found in homozygosity intype 1 patient. Expression of wild type cDNA results in an overexpressionof acid beta glucosidase. Enzyme activity (measured with 4MU beta glu coside) was about 5 to 6 fold the value of control fibroblasts. Beta xylosi dase was also detected with activity increased over 4 fold. In the studieswith mutant cDNAs the mutant proteins were characterised by enzymeactivity and western blot. Preliminary studies with mutant cDNAs showreduced residual beta glucosidase activity and recognition by policlonalacid beta glucosidase antibodies consistent with the expected results onthe basis of the type of the amino acid change. ,2001
1660,Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by pathological finding of lysosomal storage ofautofluorescent lipofuscins. Five genes designated CLN1 CLN2 CLN3 CLN5 and CLN8 associating with infantile (INCL) classical late infantile(LINCL) juvenile (JNCL) Finnish LINCL (fLINCL) and progressive epilep sy with mental retardation (EPMR) respectively have been cloned andcharacterized although genes CLN4 CLN6 and CLN7 associating withANCL (adult NCL) pLINCL (Potugal variant form of LINCL) and tLINCL(Turkish variant form of LINCL) have not been identified. CLN1 and CLN2are characterized to encode lysosomal enzymes. CLN3 CLN5 and CLN8encode membrane proteins with unknown function. Presently pathogenicmechanism underlying NCLs is yet unknown. We previously hypothesizedthat a common pathogenic pathway exists which consists of various CLNgene encoded proteins and is involved in the development of each indi vidual NCL. We recently identified two novel proteins the slow and fastBattenin interactive proteins (BIPs and BIPf) which interact with CLN3 encoded protein Battenin. Both BIPs and BIPf are highly hydrophobic withunknown function. We have characterized that BIPs ang BIPf interact witheach other as well as with CLN8 encoded protein. More interestingly BIPfshowed a stronger interaction with Battenim the most common mutantprotein resulted from a 1.02 kb deletion in CLN3 gene compared to withBattenin. In addition BIPf strongly interacts with mitochondrial ATPasesubunit C that pathologically accumulates in all NCLs except infantile NCLand BIPs interacts weakly with CLN1 and CLN2 encoded proteins. Ourdata have suggested a novel trans membrane protein complex in whichBIP proteins appear to play important roles involved in the pathogenesis ofNCLs. ,2001
1661,Bartters Syndrome (BS) is clinically characterized by hypokalemic meta bolic alkalosis and renal salt wasting. It is divided into three clinical sub types I II and III where nephrocalcinosis is present in types I and II buttypically absent in the third type. Subtype III results from a defective reab sorption of chloride across the basolateral membrane in the thick ascend ing limb of Henle in the renal tubules it is caused by mutations in the CLC NKB gene which encodes a protein of 687 aminoacids and contains 12transmembrane domains like other members of the chloride channel fam ily. We screened a group of 10 italian patients for mutations of CLCNKBgene. The coding regions (19 exons) were analysed using PCR SSCPtechnique followed by bidirectional sequencing when an abnormal migra tion pattern was observed. Five patients presenting a severe hypokalemia(S K 2.4 2.9 mM) and early onset of the clinical manifestation (<5 years) were found to carry variant alleles. The genetic variants included one 3splice site mutation in IVS 7 one insertion of 5 bp in exon 12 two deletionsof exon 6 (breakpoints are underway) and one alteration of an aminoacidin exon 12 (I419V). This latter alteration has been reported as a polymor phism. These are the first genetic alterations described of the CLCNKBgene in the Italian population. ,2001
1662,Hypophosphatasia is a heritable form of rickets/osteomalacia for whichthere is no established medical treatment. This inborn error of metabolismmanifests an extraordinary range of clinical severity spanning death inutero to premature loss of teeth. To delineate the molecular pathologycausing the extreme clinical variability and various patterns of inheritanceof hypophosphatasia we initiated comprehensive mutational analysis ofthe tissue non specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene inour large patient population. Genomic DNA from more than 120 probands spanning the entire clinical spectrum is being studied. Using a subset of10 patients and single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) wedetected approximately 70% of the potential mutations (assuming twomutations for each case of autosomal recessive inheritance and one muta tion for rare cases of dominant inheritance). This success rate is in accordwith published efficiencies for SSCP. To increase the efficiency of mutationdetection we have developed the technique of denaturing gradient gelelectrophoresis (DGGE) for the ALPL gene. DGGE primers and conditionshave been developed for all the coding exons (2 12) and adjacent splicesites the amplified products incorporate a GC clamp on one end. For thesame subset of 10 patients we have detected 100% of expected mutationsusing DGGE. Hence our preliminary results demonstrate that DGGEanalysis will be significantly more efficient than SSCP. To date at least 65different mutations (in about 70 patients) have been identified as causativefor hypophosphatasia. For our group of 60 individuals studied thus far including patients and carriers we have identified approximately 20 previ ously unreported mutations further demonstrating the vast genotypic vari ability of the disease. Characterization of the ALPL mutations in our largepatient population will elucidate the molecular pathology and inheritancepatterns and should improve prognostication for hypophosphatasia. ,2001

Genom ic DNA was extracted and the promoter and the 5 exons of the BGT genewere PCR amplified then directly sequenced. Results the child washomozygous for a TA8 polymorphism within the promoter and for a mis sense mutation in exon 4 (N400D).Conclusions Crigler Najjar type II syn drome may be due to a combination of both polymorphism within the pro moter and missense mutation in the coding sequence of the BGT GENE. ,2001
1664, magdeburg.deFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD MIM 158900) is one ofthe most frequent forms of muscular dystrophies. In about 98% of familiesautosomal dominant FSHD is mapping to 4q35 and associated with a dele tion of a variable number of 3.3 kb KpnI tandem repeat units (D4Z4). Thisdeletion can normally be detected on Southern blots hybridized with probep13E 11 (D4S104S) through EcoRI fragments smaller than 38 kb. Cross hybridization of a homologous locus on 10q26 may complicate the inter pretation of results. This problem can be overcome in most cases by addi tional cleavage with BlnI which will shorten 4q type EcoRI fragments byabout 3 kb while 10q type EcoRI fragments containing an internal BlnI site are becoming very small. It has been reported that a subtelomericinterchange between 4q35 and 10q26 occurs in 21% of normal individuals. In about 8% of individuals the interchange occurs within the repeatregions resulting in hybrid repeat arrays being composed of both 4q typeand 10q type units. These data were ascertained by pulsed field experi ments. Here we report on two patients were probably such an interchangehad occurred and became evident after routine continuous electrophore sis. In both unrelated individuals probe p13E 11 (D4F104S1) is detectinglarge EcoRI fragments (> 40 kb) which are shortened after additionalcleavage with BlnI by more than 20 kb instead of the expected 3 kb. Cur rently we interpret these findings as hybrid arrays resulting from an 4q 10qinterchromosomal exchange with breakpoints in the tandem repeat region ,2001
1665,Introduction Hereditary angioedema (HAE)(McKusick 106100) is charac terised by recurrent attacks of skin and mucous membrane oedemas. Themost serious manifestation is the oedema of larynx mucosa which endan gers the patient s life. The genetic basis of HAE is the deficiency of C1inhibitor (C1 INH). HAE is an autosomal dominant trait its frequency is1 10000 1 50000 in the general population. Mutations can be detected inall regions of the gene. Material and methods DNA was isolated from 22unrelated patients with HAE. A denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) was introduced to detect mutations in the C1 INH gene. The het eroduplexes were visualized in the UV light in ethidiumbromide stainedpolyacrylamide gels. The exons with proved presence of heteroduplexesunderwent sequencing analysis to identify the particular mutations. Themethod of DNA sequencing with radioactively labeled 33P dATP was used. If restriction enzyme specific for mutated resp. non mutated allele existed the mutation was verified by restriction analysis. Results Novel mutations S48X 8493 8494delCC 16720delA and V432Gwere identified in Czech patients with HAE. All of them are supposed to bepathogenic the former three mutations result in truncated protein and thelatter one is located to the same codon as V432E which was proved tocause HAE of type II. Previously described mutations R444C and R444Hwere found in patients with clinical type II of HAE. Conclusion DGGE is an efficient method for screening of mutations in C1inhibitor gene. Additional analyses of the individual mutations may allowmore detailed structure function relationships to be ascertained. This study was supported by grant No. 5558 3 of IGA MZ CR. ,2001
1666,Deletion or duplication within human genes is associated with a number of diseases. Most notable from the perspective of the diagnostic laboratoryPosters: Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 421are dystrophin gene rearrangements in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and PMP22 deletions or duplications seen in hereditary neu ropathy with liability to pressure palsies and hereditary motor and sensoryneuropathy respectively. We are evaluating the application of real timePCR to the detection of such rearrangements. The technique employsdual labelled probes such as Scorpions which monitor the accumulationof PCR products. By using probes with differently labelled fluorophores amplification profiles from two amplicons in multiplex reactions can becompared revealing any quantitative differences that exist. We havedemonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in a test system compar ing dystrophin exons 8 and 45. This could be extended to multiple dys trophin exons in a cost effective manner by use of generic probes. Wehave also examined PMP22 gene dosage and preliminary results areencouraging. We conclude that real time PCR offers the potential for rapidgel free analysis suitable for diagnostic quantitative applications. ,2001
1667,Introduction Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurobehavioral disorder char acterized by mental retardation absence of speech seizures motor dis function and a happy disposition. This syndrome is caused by geneticabnormalities affecting the maternal copy of chromosome region 15q11 q13. A deletion of this region is found in about 70% of patients paternaluniparental disomy (2 3%) imprinting defects (3 5%) and mutations inUBE3A gene (4 8%). Most of the reported mutations produce truncatingprotein defects and the long exon 9 or exon 16 that contains the catalyticsite are involved. Subjects and methods We have studied 23 patients witha clinical diagnosis of AS with a biparental inheritance and a normal methy lation pattern. Exons 15 and 16 were analyzed by SSCP technique. PCRproducts from exon 16 were cleaved with MspI enzyme before elec trophoresis. Products were separated on 1XMDE gel solution at roomtemperature without glycerol and visualized by silver nitrate (0 2%) stain ing. Exon 9 has been sequenced directly. PCR products were sequencedon an ABI373A automated DNA sequencer. Results and Discusion Wehave found two mutations in exon 16. The first mutation is a 4 nucleotidedeletion (3093del4) reported previously in one case by Fang et al. (1999).The second mutation (not described before)is a 14 nucleotide deletion(3167del14) that predicted to affect the polyA addition. This one is presentin a patient affected by a severe clinical spatic tetraplegia (no prehensionand unable to sit) and a severe hypoplasia of corpus callosum. As report ed in other cases mutation of the UBE3A gene are associated with typicalfeatures of AS therefore in addition to the mutation the hypoplasia of cor pus callosum could explain this severe phenotype. ,2001
1668,Ectodermal Dysplasias (EDs) are a group of more then 50 distinguishablehereditary disorders with impaired development of ectodermal structure. The molecular basis for EDs is largely unknown. One of the most commontypes of ED is X linked anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (EDA) and theidentification of the gene ED1 mutated in this condition is one of the entrypoint to study the pathogenesis of the disease. EDA is a clinical syndromecharacterised by loss of hair sweat glands and teeth. ED1 gene encodesa protein product named ectodysplasin. EDA gene undergoes extensivealternative splicing and produces several transcripts the original shortestEDA O form encodes a 135 amino acid product that localise to the outercell membrane. The longest ED1 transcript encodes a 391 amino acidform EDA A that includes a positively charged domain 19 repeats of Gly X Y similar to the group of membrane associated collagenous type II pro teins. In addition to the collagen domain the C terminal domain of theEDA A protein contains a domain of homology to the member of the tumornecrosis factor (TNT) ligand family. More than 36 mutations of the ED1gene have been identified so far. In the present study we characterise anew ED1 mutation in a patient with clinical manifestation of EDA sparseand dry hair incomplete teething and pointed incisors teeth dry skin shortstature (10ÃÂ¡ 25ÃÂ¡ percentile) and learning disability. We amplified andsequenced all the exons of ED1 gene using the ABI 377 sequencer and weidentified a transition T >C at position 884 causing the amino acid change Val295Ala. The mutation was present in one allele of the probands moth er but not in the grandmother indicating a de novo mutation. ,2001
1669, halle.deIn man and mammals prenatal exposure to the teratogens retinoic acid(RA) and/or retinoids (RX) results in characteristic congenital anomaliesincluding cardiac and craniofacial malformations. Incidence and pattern ofthe malformations apparently depends on dose and stage of exposure. Based on a retinoic acid induced gene trap approach (Forrester et al. 1996) we set up a strategy to identify RA/RX downstream genes of mouseand human development that are possible candidate genes involved in thegeneration of congenital malformations. By RACE PCR of trapped ESclones we identified two novel genes that are expressed in early brainand/or heart. In northern analyses a cDNA fragment of the 1st gene(EScD 1) identifies a brain specific 6 kb transcript in embryonic head (10dp.c.) and adult brain. The 2nd gene (EScD 2) is expressed in fetal brain(2.5 kb) and heart (1.4 kb). By screening of mouse and human Marathon cDNA libraries and analyzing homologous ESTs we identified about 2 kb ofthe respective cDNA sequences including the polyA tails. The mouse andhuman sequences share homologies of 96 % (EScD 1) and 98 % (EScD 2). Searches for human homology revealed that the human gene EScD 2is represented within human BAC and cosmid sequences mapping tochromosome 16p13.3. Breakpoints within that chromosome segment areknown to be associated with cardiac anomalies. Using EscD 1 cDNAprimers we isolated a human BAC clone and localized the respective geneon chromosome segment 7q32 by FISH. The detailed analysis of theexpression patterns of EScD 1 and EScD 2 by whole mount in situhybridization and the study of the mouse gene trap phenotypes will giveinformation about the involvement of the two genes in early human devel opment and specific disorders of brain and/or heart.

1670,Currently most genetic diagnostic protocols are PCR based and do notreadily yield quantitative data. As a consequence potential deletions andduplications of the regions analyzed often go undetected unless specificmethods are applied. Southern blotting is the most commonly used methodbut is time consuming and laborious and the results are not always easyto interpret. We have applied a new method called Multiplex AmplifiableProbe Hybridization (MAPH). This technique allows the analysis of manyregions simultaneously using a series of probes constructed in such a waythat all can be PCR amplified with only one primer pair. Followinghybridization to immobilized DNA the probes are reamplified and separat ed by gel electrophoresis. Alternatively using fluorescently labeled primersit is possible to separate the different products on the ABI3700 a 96 cap illary sequencer. This allows up to 96 samples to be analyzed concurrent ly. By comparing peak areas of products between controls and patients weare able to detect both deletions and duplications. Microarray analysis hasalso been performed circumventing the size limitations imposed by elec trophoretic separation. We have applied this technique to the diagnosis ofseveral genetic disorders including Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystro phy Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy and mental retardation of unknownetiology. In the muscular dystrophies individual exons were examined whereas in the mentally retarded cases probes specific for the subtelom eric regions of each chromosome were prepared. We are investigating thepossibility of combining different probe sets and detecting products usingdifferent fluorescent labels further increasing the resolving power of thetechnique. ,2001
1671,422 Posters: Therapy for Genetic DisordersFor non viral gene therapy we managed to optimize the synthesis of tissue specificity protein conjugates combining capacity of internalization and ahigh level of expression of the gene. Selection of the chemical method ofmodification of the components has a significant effect on the success ofthe gene therapy experiment for it influences on the activity of the incom ing components and size complex of DNA conjugate. Proteins with highaffinity for hepatocyte receptors (asyaloorosomucoid) hepatocyte andmyocyte receptors (lactoferrin(Lf)) cancer cells (transferrin(Tf) a fetopro tein (a Ft)) etc. were isolated and purified. We mixed plasmid DNA withnative Lf and with conjugates which contained protein ligands mentionedabove and compounds tightly bound to DNA. At the same time we devel oped a new method of modification of hydrocortisone 21 hemisuccinate forcarrying foreign DNA. This carrier was chosen due to its ability to penetrateeasily into target cells and into their nuclei very low background concen tration in the blood plasma high rate of absorption it from the bloodstream. We tested synthetic conjugates and complexes with DNA by laser spec troscopy immunochemical physicochemical and enzymatic methods. Theefficiency of gene delivery (human apolipoprotein A I (apo A 1) human dis trofin cDNA (pDMD1) and reporter genes lacZ gfp) was tested in vitro andin vivo on laboratory animals. Some conjugates we tested using a modelmouse line (mdx) with Duchenne type muscular dystrophy. The tissuespecificity of gene delivery was demonstrated. The dynamics of geneexpression (7 21 days after injection) was evaluated in accord with the pro tocols of the synthesis of protein conjugates. ,2001
1672,Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe sub lethal disease whichresults in early lost of ability to walk at the age of 12 years approximately and premature death at the age of 20 25 years. In spite of some progressin therapy of this disease it is still impossible to improve quality and dura tion of life considerably. The most promising approach is gene therapy. Weare studying optimization of a transfection of mouse skeletal muscles (mdxmice Ã¢\x80\x94 a biological model of DMD) by looking for effective vectors andways for plasmid DNA delivery. For this purpose we have compared angene expression following intramuscular injection of these genes in thecomplex with different vectors. (1) Synthetic olygopeptide K8 and JTS 1 Ã¢\x80\x94number of transfected myofibres was increased compared to naked plas mid DNA from 1.1% up to 12% for Lac Z gene and from 1.2% up to 7% fordystrophin gene. (2) Using of an adenovirus EDS 76 and polylysine reli able has not increased an expression of a luciferase gene in muscles ofmice. A receptor mediated transfection using insulin ligand associated withpolylysine (3) bird s adenovirus EDS 76 (4) or adenovirus Ad5neo (5)have not resulted in increase of luciferase gene expression compared tonaked plasmid pCMV Luc. Following intravenous injection of naked plas mid pCMV Lac Z the expression of beta galactosidase was studied in a dif ferent mouse organs (skeletal muscles heart lung liver and spleen). Inaddition the optimum concentration of plasmid and duration of markergene expression were determined. ,2001

1674,Targeting of genomic sequences by replacement with homologous DNAsegments can be used to modify specific genes within chromosomal DNA. We used the small fragment homologous replacement (SFHR) strategy tocorrect transformed human airway epithelial cells from cystic fibrosis (CF)individuals homozygous for the Ã\x98F508 mutation (CFBE41o ). The trans fection was made using liposomes (GenePorter Gene Therapy Systems USA) combined with different concentrations of purified double strand DNAfragments. Lipoplexes were then added to cells and incubated for 5 hoursa 37ÃÂ¡C. Replacement at the appropriate genomic locus (exon 10) byexogenous DNA and expression of the modified CFTR mRNA wereassayed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Differentconditions that modulate SFHR mediated correction were evaluated including the type modification introduced into the genomic DNA (ie dele tion or insertion) the fragment to lipid charge ratio and stability of the mod ification as a function of time after transfection. PCR analysis was per formed on exon 10 genomic CFTR DNA and on mRNA extracted fromtransfected cells after 5 days of transfection duration. A corrected genotype(Ã\x98F508/wild type) was obtained as demonstrated by genomic and RNAanalysis transfecting 5x106 CF cells with a liposome to DNA fragmentcharge ratio equal to 6 1. To confirm the results we transfected wild typecell lines (16HBE14o ) with a DNA fragment carrying the Ã\x98F508 mutation. Heterozygous mutant cells were obtained when a charge ratio of 2.2 1 wasused corresponding to 12000 ng of DNA fragment. Kinetics of transfectionexperiment was also performed in order to optimize the transfection proto col of correction. Corrected alleles are efficiently transcribed up to 120hours from transfection as demonstrated by genomic DNA amplification. To gain further insights about the pathway(s) involved in the delivery oftherapeutic DNA fragments transmission electron microscopy (TEM) wasused to monitor lipoplexes within the cells after transfection of gold labelledDNA fragment. At 72 hrs after transfection large endosomes containinglipoplexes were detected perinuclear. This study demonstrate that SFHRtechnique is able to target and modify specific CFTR alleles in normal andÃ\x98F508 human airway epithelial cells by deletion and insertion of 3 bp respectively.

1675,Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with lack of dystrophin causes a pro gressive degeneration of skeletal muscles. Several years ago specialapproach for DMD gene correction using transplantation of myoblast cellcultures into patient s muscles is developed. These cultures are preparedfrom muscular biopsy samples of healthy donors in which containedmononuclear satellite cells. Satellite cells are myogenic precursor cells thatare activated during muscle growth and regeneration. There are some datathat donor s myoblast can fuse with recipient s myofibrils and expression ofdonor s genome contained normal DMD gene repair hereditary genedefect. In Russia we begin clinical trail of myoblast transplantation to volunteers DMD patients by protocol single muscle treatment and using own tech Posters: Therapy for Genetic Disorders 423nique for preparation of myoblast cell cultures. All donors were previously screened for human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis B C and herpesinfection. For the selection of donor recipient pairs it was analyzed sev eral HLA antigen blood groups and Rh Every recipient receivedcyclosporine (3 5 mg/kg body weight per day) two weeks before trans plantation and one month after transplantation for immunosuppresion. Suspension (10 ml) contained 50 90 millions of myoblast cells was trans planted ( 10 12 intramuscular injections) into m. tibialis anterior of one leg. Injection of equal volume of physiological salt solution into other leg (m. tib ialis anterior control) was administered in a similar manner. There were noany side effects in all recipients during 6 months 1 year clinical trail. Biop sy specimens of four DMD boys (age 6 10) 6 months after myoblast trans plantation were examined to detect donor s DNA and dystrophin expres sion. It was revealed donor s DNA in two cases and dystrophin expression(immunohistochemical labeling with Novocastra lab. dystrophin antibodieskit) in one case. Dystrophin and donor s DNA were absent in the sham injected muscles. ,2001
1676,It is estimated that as many as 20% of Duchenne muscular dystrophypatients have nonsense mutations in dystrophin gene. Nonsense suppres sor tRNAs have been suggested as potential agents for human somaticgene therapy. To investigate effects of suppressor tRNA gene transfectionin vivo we used mdx mice which have an ochre mutation in 23 exon of dys trophin gene. After in vivo transfection of genetic construction containingsuppressor tRNA gene (pcDNA3 sup tRNA ochre) by means of lactoferrinethe number of dystrophin positive (NDPM) myofibers was 2 5 % which isgreater than background level of revertant myofibers (1%). NDPM aftercontrol transfection of genetic construction containing dystrophin gene full length cDNA (pTG 11025) was 3 8%. In order to study possible toxiceffects of suppressor tRNA in vitro we have made a co transfection ofHeLa cells using two plasmids pcDNA3 sup tRNA (ochre or amber) andpCMV LacZ by means of non viral vehicle VSST 525. High concentrationof suppressor tRNA construction led to tenfold decrease of number trans fected cells in comparison with control transfection of pCMV LacZ only. Further increase in concentration resulted in complete absence of trans fected cells. On the contrary decreasing concentration led to augmentationof the number beta galactosidase positive cells. Thus over dose of sup pressor tRNAs in the cell have clear toxic effects in vitro. Our results sug gest existence of concentration threshold for the level of suppressor tRNAin the cell to gain therapeutic effect of suppression without toxicity. ,2001
1677,Sandhoff disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseasecharacterized by the intralysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. It isdue to mutations in the hexosaminidases beta chain gene resulting in aHex A and B deficiency. This disease predominantly affects the centralnervous system. Its evolution is dramatic and it still does not have any effi cient treatment. In order to test the feasibility of gene transfer methods inthis model specific AAV vectors were constructed. They contain the HEXAand HEXB cDNAs under the control of the CAG promoter. HeLa cellsinfected with AAV HEXA or AAV HEXB showed a high level of hex osaminidases activity demonstrating the functionality of both recombinantvectors. AAV HEXB was then injected in the murine model of Sandhoff dis ease. Intramuscular injections led to a huge restoration of Hex A and Bactivities in the injected muscle but no secretion was observed. AAV HEXB was also injected intracerebrally in hexb / neonates. Histologicalstaining showed a high enzyme activity in widely diffuse areas and totalhexosaminidases activity in the whole brain was restored to about the nor mal level. However when hexosaminidases activity was assayed after HexA and B separation by DEAE cellulose chromatography a massive restora tion of Hex B activity was obtained even though Hex A level only reached20% of normal. The coadministration of HEXA and HEXB vectors will prob ably permit to reach therapeutic levels of both hexosaminidases A and B especially in the central nervous system which is the mainly affectedorgan in this pathology. ,2001
1678,Fabry disease is an X linked recessive disease caused by a defectivelysosomal enzyme a galactosidase A (a GalA) characterized by skinlesions and involvement of heart central nerve system blood vessels andkidneys. We have identified a family of patients with Fabry disease. RT PCR sequencing of the peripheral lymphocyte RNA from all female carri ers and a male patient reveals a C to T mutation resulting in an amino acidsubstitution of Pro 40 by Ser. The serum a GalA activity from the malepatient was undetectable and the lymphocyte a GalA activity was less than10 % of the normal value. Recently a novel strategy to correct a pointmutation using chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides has been reported. Totest whether it is feasible to correct this mutation by chimeric RNA/DNAoligonucleotides we transfected the chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotideswith the correct sequence into cultured peripheral lymphocytes and EBVirus transformed lymphoblasts from the male patient. The cells weretransfected with a mixture of chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides andEffectene (Qiagen) and harvested 5 7 days later for preparation of genom ic DNA and cell extract. The conversion of mutant T to C was confirmed byallele specific PCR assay on the genomic DNA. The treatment increasedthe a GalA enzymatic activity from baseline 9.2Ã¢\x80\x930.7% and 8.5Ã¢\x80\x931.6% (of thenormal value) to 15.0Ã¢\x80\x932.1% and 20.9Ã¢\x80\x934.9% in cultured peripheral lym phocytes and EB Virus transformed lymphoblasts respectively. In conclu sion a point mutation in the a GalA gene was identified in a family withFabry disease. This point mutation can be corrected with chimericRNA/DNA oligonucleotides as demonstrated by allele specific PCR assayand increased level of a GalA enzymatic activity in the treated cells. Poten tially this gene therapy strategy can be used to treat Fabry disease in thisfamily. ,2001
1679,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease char acterized by degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord lead ing to muscular paralysis with muscular atrophy. No effective treatment ofthis disorder is presently available. Studies of the correlation between dis ease severity and the amount of SMN protein have indicated an inverserelationship. We report here that compound A effectively increases theamount of exon 7 containing SMN protein in SMA lymphoid cell lines bychanging the alternating splicing pattern of exon 7 in the SMN2 gene. Invivo compound A treatment of SMA like mice resulted in increasedexpression of SMN protein in motor neurons of the spinal cord. Further more SMA clinical symptoms of the mice significantly improved. Oraladministration of compound A to intercrosses of heterozygous pregnantknockout transgenic SMA like mice decreased the birth rate of severetypes SMA like mice and SMA symptoms were ameliorated for all threetypes of SMA like mice. These results suggest that compound A may be aneffective drug for treatment of human SMA patients. ,2001
1680,Children with fully recessive (Type I/I) cystinuria have a high risk of stoneformation in the first decade of life. However among 9 such children withproven rBAT mutations followed from birth onset of nephrolithiasis did notoccur until age 7 10 years despite maximal urinary cystine excretion in thefirst years. To assess inhibitors of urinary cystine precipitation we devel oped an assay in which radiolabelled cystine (4mM) was dissolved in urineat 37 degrees C. after alkalinization to pH10 with NaOH. Samples werethen brought to pH5 with HCl centrifuged and the %cpm precipitating wascalculated. The assay was also used to compare inhibition of urinary cys tine precipitation by endogenous macromolecules and by several standardand novel therapeutic agents. Percent cystine precipitation varied widelyamong normal children (74+/ 34%) whereas variability of repeated deter minations on a single individual was modest (64+/ 3%). Cystine precipita tion (%control) was strongly inhibited by D penicillamine (8+/ 9%) andDMSA (6+/ 3%)at concentrations corresponding to predicted urinary levelsfollowing oral doses of 2g/day and 2.1g/day respectively. Thiola was mod 424 Posters: Therapy for Genetic Disorderserately effective (37+/ 21%)whereas captopril was a weak inhibitor (77+/ 21%). To assess the ontogeny of endogenous inhibitors urine sampleswere dialyzed against PBS to normalize osmolarity. Cystine precipitationwas greater in urine from children from children 6 10 years (86+/ 5%) thanin children 0 5 years (58+/ 11%) p<0.025. In conclusion non dialyzableinhibitors of urinary cystine precipitation probably account for protectionfrom nephrolithiasis in very young cystinuria children. DMSA is compara ble to D penicillamine as an in vitro inhibitor of cystine precipitation andmay potentially be a therapeutic agent for cystinuria. ,2001
1681,Five human embryos with NTD Ã¢\x80\x94 craniorachischisis (CRS) and spina bifi da (SB) were revealed among 40 582 first trimester abortuses screenedfor malformations. Expression of SHH GLI3 and JAG1 genes and theirrelations to one another in the central nervous system were analyzed andcompared to the age control pattern. Expression of the genes of both theSHH and NOTCH signaling pathways was disorganized in NTD embryos. Broad double or multiplied SHH signal was revealed in the floor plate insubtotal CRS and SB a decreased floor plate SHH expression was notedin total CRS. Two signals were revealed in the site of the split cervical por tion of the notochord (primary site of neural tube closure). Additionaldomains of GLI3 expression were noticed between the two floor plates intotal CRS and SB. GLI3 was abnormally expressed in the floor plate insubtotal CRS. In the completely flat portions of the open neural tube pat tern of GLI3 expression characteristic of the neural plate persisted but inthe concave segments where the elevation of neural folds has alreadyoccurred GLI3 domain was located in the lateral parts corresponding to thedorsal side of the neural tube. Additional domains of JAG1 expressionwere revealed in the neural tube of NTD embryos. Abnormal pattern ofgenes expression may reflect partial or complete duplication of the axialstructures in NTD. ,2001
1682,Post transcriptional processes like mRNA stabilization post transcriptionalmodification and mRNA transport influence mRNA translation and proteinlevels and have been suggested to play an important role in developmen tal gene regulation. RNA binding proteins are involved in all these mecha nisms but their contribution to cell differentiation is still poorly understood. Our aim is to elucidate the function of genes encoding for RNA binding proteins in normal and abnormal development of neuronal structures inmammals. We have recently characterized a novel mouse cDNA which wecalled Etr2 and which is closely related to the elav type gene family. Wedemonstrate that Etr2 is expressed in the developing central nervous sys tem in the mouse (telencephalon rhombencephalon spinal cord). Withongoing differentiation Etr2 expression becomes restricted to the cerebel lum where it persists in the adult organism. To further analyze the possiblefunction of Etr2 in neural development we applied transient expression ofEtr2 in a heterologous system by microinjection of synthetic Etr2 mRNAinto Xenopus embryos at the two cell stage. Our results suggest that over expression/misexpression of Etr2 in Xenopus alters the expression profileof neuronal markers and/or developmental fate of neuronal precursor cellsalong the closing neural tube. To support these findings we are studyingthe effect of Etr2 transfection on neural differentiation in rat PC12 cells. Weare also on the way to isolate the Xenopus orthologue of Etr2 for structur al and functional comparison. We predict Etr2 and the respective humanhomologue as candidate genes for developmental defects of the centralnervous system. ,2001
1683,Numerous mutations which initiate abnormal retinal development havebeen identified however subsequent cellular events causing retinal pathol ogy are poorly understood. PURPOSE To identify groups of co ordinatelyexpressed genes during normal retinal development in the mouse. METH ODS Retinas were collected from normal mice at post natal (PN) days 5 8 12 and 15. For each time point Cy 3 labeled probes were prepared byRT PCR of 1 g of total retinal RNA. Probes were hybridized to microarrayscontaining 4600 murine genes. Each gene is arrayed in duplicate creatinga chip with 9200 spots. The ratio of expression for each gene between sub sequent time points was compared. For each time point genes which wereexpressed beyond 2 standard deviations from the mean on both spots ofthe array were selected for further analysis. This subset was subjected tocluster and k means analysis so that the expression pattern for each geneover the four time points could be assessed. RESULTS Over the four timepoints 369 genes had significant changes in expression. At each timepoint gene expression could be divided into 4 6 general patterns using k means analysis. CONCLUSIONS Alteration in gene expression duringretinal development is complex and dynamic. Patterning and cell cyclegenes are predominantly expressed between PN5 8. Thereafter they aresuperseded by genes controlling housekeeping and neuron specific meta bolic processes. Confirmation of the expression pattern of selected genesby northern blotting and in situ hybridization is in progress. ,2001
1684,Disruption of post squalene cholesterol biosynthesis by specific inhibitors(AY9944 BM15 776) or mutations in cholesterogenic enzymes leads tocharacteristic embryonic malformations including craniofacial dysmor phisms postaxial polydactyly shortened limbs chondrodysplasia andsensorimotor impairment. Mutations in the following enzymes have beenassociated with human syndromes 7 dehydrocholesterol reductase =Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome C3 sterol dehydrogenase = CHILD syn drome sterol delta8 delta7 isomerase = Conradi H nermann Happle syn drome. Mouse models for all three syndromes have been describedrecently (bare patches and tattered mutants and 7DHCR k.o. mice). Thepathogenic mechanisms are not known but some symptoms significantlyresemble the phenotype of Hedgehog signaling mutants. The Hedgehogfamily of proteins plays a key role in embryonic morphogenesis of both ver tebrates and invertebrates. The family members are post translationallymodified by covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety and their functioncan be inhibited by certain plant alkaloids (cyclopamine jervine) whichshow a structural similarity to cholesterol. To elucidate the disruptive mech anism we investigated the expression of cholesterogenic enzymes in themouse at various developmental stages by mRNA in situ hybridisation. Both proximal (7 DHCR bare patches tattered) and distal enzymes(HMG CoA reductase IPP isomerase) share a characteristic pattern ofPosters: Development Differentiation and Morphogenetics 425expression In addition to a weak ubiquitous expression a strong well defined staining occurs in dorsal root ganglia. Further foci of cholestero genesis are observed in cranial ganglia pharyngeal pouches and limbbuds. These results corroborate a specific function of cholesterol biosyn thesis in developmental pathways. ,2001
1685,Background. Hox genes control patterning of many different embryonicstructures including the axial and appendicular skeleton. In the developinglimbs Hox genes are expressed within specific bone elements. Loss of function mutations indicate that mice with targeted deletions of specificHox genes are missing the bone element in which that Hox gene would benormally expressed. Ulnaless is a semi dominant mutation and a model forderegulation of posterior HoxD gene expression. The Ulnaless limb phe notype in the zeugopod is allelic to the phenotype in Hoxa 11 Hoxd 11double mutant mice. This phenotype is characterized by severe reductionin the size of ulna and radius. Methods. Wild type and mutant Ulnalessembryos at different development stages were obtained and their limb phe notype compared. Limbs were processed to obtained skeletal preparationsand histological sections. mRNA expression of several genes was studiedby in situ hybridization. Results. On skeletal preparations a reduction inthe size of the mutant humerus radius and ulna as well as an abnormalshape of the radius and ulna is evident as early as 13.5 dpc. Histologysections showed a delay in the differentiation of the mutant humerus radius and ulna of 3 5 and 7 days of delay respectively when comparedto wild type littermates. Delay in differentiation in Ulnaless mutant radiusand ulna was confirmed by in situ hybridization using Ihh (expressed byprehypertrophic chondrocytes) and Collagen X (expressed by hypertrophicchondrocytes) as markers. Expression of genes of the Ihh feedback loop like PTHrP and PTH/PTHrP receptor are delayed in accordance withdelayed Ihh expression. Additional in situ hybridizations for a limited num ber of genes among them TGFb1 TGFb2 and several BMPs showedeither a normal temporal expression or delay. Conclusions. Reduction insize and abnormal shape of the Ulnaless zeugopod is evident as early asstage 13.5 dpc. The Ulnaless limb shows skeletal and histological evi dence of delay in development that affects more severely the ulna. Sever al genetic markers confirmed this delay in development. Although our geneexpression analysis has been extremely informative none of the candidateregulators of bone morphogenesis is expressed in an altered manner sug gestive of being a direct Hox gene target. Additional studies are needed toidentify the network of Hox gene transcriptional targets involved in bonedevelopment in vertebrates. ,2001
1686,The WT1 protein has been implicated in the control of proliferation and dif ferentiation of hematopoietic cells. An inverse correlation has beenobserved between WT1 expression and the cell maturation stage thus ahigt WT1 expression has been found in CD34+ cells whereas matureblood cells show no WT1 activity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clon al hematologic neoplasia that arises from the transformation of ahematopoietic stem cell resulting in altered proliferation and differentia tion. High levels of WT1 have been reported in bone marrow cells fromAML patients. To date however WT1 expression in cultures of AMLCD34+ cells supplemented with growth factors has not been assessed. Inthe present study we have determined the expression of WT1 inCD34+Lin cells from normal and AML origin and evaluated its expressionin cultures supplemented with recombinant cytokines (G CSF and GM CSF). CD34+Lin cells both from umbilical cord blood (normal control) andleukemic marrow were obtained by immune based negative selection WT1 transcripts were determined by RT PCR and confirmed by DNAsequencing hematopoietic cell maturation was determined by morpholog ic analysis. Our results show higher levels of WT1 in leukemic CD34+Lin cells than in their normal counterparts. When leukemic cells were culturedwith G CSF and GM CSF for 10 20 days large numbers of mature bloodcells were produced interestingly WT1 expression remained higt. Thesefindings suggest that WT1 expression does not interfere with cytokine induced myeloid terminal maturation of AML cells in vitro. ,2001
1687, halle.deThe spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a well known model for thestudy of hypertension and heart failure. Diverse quantitative trait loci(QTLs) for hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy indicate that differentchromosomal areas account for the development of the two diseases. Within the development of the clinical symptoms the SHR passes throughdistinct stages. Up to four weeks after birth the animals are normotensive and then males firstly evolve hypertension (12 weeks) and afteron hyper trophy of the left heart ventricle (26 weeks). To identify candidate genesthat contribute to cardiac hypertrophy we screened the hearts of theseSHRs for differentially expressed genes. For having a high resolutionmethod we established a subtractive hybridization system based on cDNAselection and suppression PCR. The subtractive hybridizations from the 4 to 12 and to 26 weeks stages resulted in 144 different cDNA clones. Thefollowing differential screening suggested 48 cDNAs to be candidates fordifferentially expressed genes. Northern blot analyses of meanwhile 18cDNAs identified 4 genes which are upregulated at their expression levelin the 26 weeks stage in comparison to the wild type Wistar Kyoto rat. According to homology searches in electronic databases we identified 4novel genes that are differentially expressed in hypertrophic growing SHRhearts. Next we will check the chromosomal localization of these genes inrespect to known QTLs for cardiac hypertrophy by FISH analysis and ana lyze the expression and integrity of these genes in other hypertrophic ani mal models.(Supported by BMBF) ,2001
1688,Embryonic stem cells (ES) are the origin of mature cells of the centralnervous system during fetal development. They provide the ability of plas ticity and reconstitution to the brain. There are experimental data that inneurodegenerative disorders e.g. Parkinson s disease the transplantationof ES may reduce the progressive loss of cells and their functional deteri oration. Conditionally immortalized striatal ES (ST14A) of the rat were426 Posters: Therapy for Genetic Disorderstransfected with the rat ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) cDNA in order to improve the functional efficiency of the grafted cells by secreting the neu rotrophic factor. The extent of CNTF expression was determined on thetranscription level by using real time PCR (FRET technology) and on theprotein level by Western blottting and flow cytometry. Cells were charac terized with regard to proliferation (H3 thymidine assay WST 1 test) andapoptosis (TUNEL assay). Differential RNA expression patterns wereinvestigated by using a microarray system. Transfected cell clones withconsiderably different expression levels of CNTF were isolated. They hadan increased proliferative activity compared to the native cells. Switchingfrom non permissive (33ÃÂ¡C) to permissive (39ÃÂ¡C) culturing conditions led todecrease of proliferation. Proportions of apoptotic cells were not signifi cantly different between CNTF transfected and native cells. About 250 dif ferentially expressed genes were analyzed. Concerning the CNTF trans fected cells the microarray data suggest a tendency towards a neuronaldifferentiation and a decreased level of pro apoptotic factors under per missive culturing conditions. Further efforts have to be done in order tocharacterize the neuronal differentiation of CNTF transfected ST14A cellson the protein level. The transfected cells will be characterized regardingtheir differentiation and migration in the in vivo transplantation ,2001
1689,The degeneration and loss of the motor neurons of the anterior horn is themajor neuropathological finding in childhood spinal muscular atrophy(SMA). Neuronal death naturally occurs during development of the spinalcord but the mechanism and timing of motor neuron death in SMA remainunknown. The objectives of this work were to compare the neuronal deathin control and SMA spinal cord and to determine whether the neurodegen erative process and the loss of motor neurons in SMA spinal cord are dueto an enhanced cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. A quantitativestudy was carried out comparing neuronal death in 57 control fetuses and12 SMA fetuses with homozygous absence of the SMN1 gene. Between12 15 weeks of gestational age a significant increase in nuclear DNA vul nerability was detected in SMA fetuses and was reflected by a decrease inthe number of neurons of the anterior horn. Neurons with nuclear DNA vul nerability are no longer detected at the end of the fetal period and the post natal period. The study by immunohistochemistry of two proteins involvedin apoptosis such as Bcl 2 and Bax did not show any differential expres sion in control and SMA spinal cords. Our findings indicate that in type ISMA the absence or dysfunction of the SMN1 gene is reflected by anenhanced neuronal death. This is associated with a progressive loss ofmotor neurons towards the neonatal period. Supported by FundaciMarat TV3 and FIS 00 481. ,2001
1690,Murine Foxq1 is a fork head transcription factor mainly expressed in kid ney and stomach. The 2.7 kb transcript was found in all tested embryonicstages as well as in embryonic stem cells. In order to analyze the tran scriptional regulation we isolated the genomic clones of the mouse Foxq1and human FOXQ1 genes including the 5 region. The DNA sequences ofboth genes are 80 5% identical and show high homology to the rat geneFoxQ1 (former HFH 1). The genes contain no intron and no TATA motifwithin the region of 25 35 bp 5 of the putative transcription start wasdetected by sequence analysis. The predicted proteins contain an identicalDNA binding domain and two putative activation domains which are con served between the 3 species. Reporter gene assays reveal that importantregulatory elements are located within a 200 bp sequence which is highlyconserved between mouse and man and is located around 500 bpupstream of ATG. Analyzing the region we identified three binding sites ofmembers of the Sp1 family of transcription factors band shift assays withthese sites showed two specific DNA/protein complexes. Using antibodiesagainst Sp1 and the related transcription factor Sp3 both complexes dis appeared. Reporter gene assays with the Drosophila Schneider cell lineSL2 together with Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression vectors showed that bothproteins are able to activate the reporter gene. A Yeast One Hybrid screenshould help to identify other factors which could explain the tissue speci ficity of Foxq1. ,2001
1691,The transcription factor runx2/cbfa1 belongs to the family of runt relatedgenes and is an essential factor for bone development. In humans muta tions in runx2/cbfa1 are responsible for cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD).Mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of runx2/cbfa1 die immediatelyafter birth and exhibit a complete lack of bone formation due to an earlyblock in osteoblast development. Recently it has been shown thatrunx2/cbfa1 is also involved in chondrocyte development. To further inves tigate this a transgenic mouse model was created in which the transcrip tional activity of runx2/cbfa1 is downregulated specifically in chondrocytes. A dominant negative construct consisting only of the DNA binding domainof runx2/cbfa1 under control of the Collagen2a1 promoter was used. Thispromoter is active only in resting and proliferating chondrocytes. The trans genic mice exhibit a markedly reduced size of the scapula and the stylo pod while zeugoppod and autopod are less affected. This phenotype canbe increased by crossing the mice to homozygousity. Using in situ hybridi sation it is shown that downregulation of runx2/cbfa1 signalling results in amarked delay in chondrocyte differentiation. Thus runx2/cbfa1 acts as apositive regulator during chondrocyte differentiation contributing to the cor rect pace of bone growth. ,2001
1692,Mutations in fibrillin 1 a microfibrillar glycoprotein with a ubiquitous distri bution are known to cause the Marfan syndrome (MFS). Given the patho physiology of MFS it has been hypothesized that fibrillin 1 plays primarilya load bearing function in the extracellular matrix. However it has beenshown that fibrillin 1 is expressed as early as the primitive streak in thedeveloping chick embryo. Since load bearing is not a critical function atthat stage of development we used an antisense approach to target fib rillin 1 during early chick development. Our initial studies were focused ongetting antisense oligonucleotides into the embryo. Using fluorescencetagged oligonucleotides we observed a greater accumulation of oligonu cleotide in the embryo if the oligonucleotides were bound to cationic blockcopolymers of polyethyleneglycol and polyethylenimine. Block copolymerbound phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides were inoculated intoeggs starting at four hours post fertilization. Control eggs were inoculatedwith equivalent volumes of PBS copolymer alone antisense oligonu cleotides without copolymer and sense oligonucleotide with copolymer. Atboth 3 and 6 days all control embryos were at normal stages. Embryosinoculated with antisense to fibrillin 1 with the block copolymer showed arange of abnormalities from delay in development to gross morphologicalabnormalities. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on fibrillin 1antisense targeted embryos using antibodies to chick fibrillin 1 and fibrillin 2. While significant immunostaining was observed in control and mock tar geted embryos we observed specific decrease in fibrillin 1 staining inembryos targeted with antisense to fibrillin 1. Fibrillin 2 immunostainingwas unaffected in these fibrillin 1 targeted embryos. These studies point tothe critical role fibrillin 1 plays in early embryogenesis and the greater effi ciency and efficacy of block copolymer bound antisense oligonucleotides. ,2001
1693,The molecular mechanisms of mammalian sex determination are poorlyunderstood. To date only a minority of sex reversal phenotypes in humanscan be explained by mutations in known sex determining genes suggest ing the existence of other intermediates in the sex determination pathway. We hypothesize that developmentally regulated genes differentiallyexpressed between the developing male and female gonad may controlsex determination. The purpose of our experiments was to compare geni tal ridges from males and females at nan,2001
1694, ulm.deIn male mammals the Y chromosomal gene SRY is usually required to ini tiate testis determination. Nevertheless there are some species with atestis determination that is independent of SRY. In the mole vole Ellobiuslutescens both sexes have the same karyotype 17 X. On the cytogeneticlevel there are no sex specific differences and the absence of Sry hasbeen shown by molecular methods. It is now speculated that one of the sexdetermining genes acting usually downstream of Sry is mutated and hastaken over testis determining function. The only candidate gene for testisdetermination without SRY is nan,2001
1695,True hermaphroditism (TH) is a sex reversal condition characterized bydevelopment of testicular and ovarian tissue in a single individual. TH is agenetically heterogeneous condition as 60% of the cases are 46 XX whilethe remainder are 46 XY or mosaics with normal or abnormal Y chromo some. Molecular studies have shown that 10% of 46 XX TH present SRYsequences and the mechanisms leading to testicular development in Ynegative 46 XX TH remain unknown. We report the results of molecularstudies performed in 4 TH patients presenting a 46 XX karyotype. Patients1 and 2 were SRY negative in both leukocytic and gonadal DNA. PCRanalysis in DNA obtained from blood leukocytes of patients 3 and 4demonstrated the absence of SRY but SRY was positive in DNA obtainedfrom their gonads. In patient 3 SRY presented a deletion at its 5 regionand in patient 4 a normal SRY sequence was found. The molecular find ings in patients 3 and 4 indicate unusual mechanisms leading to 46 XX TH in patient 3 SRY was absent in leukocytes but it was present and partial ly deleted in DNA from gonads. in patient 4 SRY was absent in leukocyticDNA but present and confined to the gonad We propose that this is anunusual mechanism for XX TH and that the early presence of SRY wassufficient to partially differentiate testicular tissue with subsequent loss( vanishing mosaicism) of this genetic material in most tissues. ,2001
1696,Distal chromosome 9p contains a locus that when deleted is a cause of46 XY gonadal dysgenesis in the absence of extragenital anomalies. Thislocus might account for the frequently observed cases of 46 XY puregonadal dysgenesis who do not harbor mutations in SRY the sex masterregulator gene found in mammalian species. The genomic organization of9p positional candidate genes is currently being studied and mutationalscreens are ongoing. Among pthers positional candidates including twoadditional doublesex related genes the evidence to support a role for thegene DMRT1 in vertebrate male sexual development is accumulating. Although formal proof of the requirement of DMRT1 in gonadal sex fatechoice has not been obtained so far the particular interest in this gene andperhaps other doublesex related genes identified in vertebrates lies in thatthey may provide an entry point to a conserved mechanism of sex deter mination across animal phyla. We discuss recent results and emergingviews on the genetics of sex determination while stressing that the major ity of cases of 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis remain unexplained. The latter islikely to be efficiently addressed by positional cloning efforts particularly byconsidering the wealth of sequence data provided by the Human GenomeProject. ,2001

1698,"Recently Spandidos et al. (1998) have reported a high level of microsatel lite mutation in spontaneously aborted embryos. We have analyzed STRmismatches at 55 families with a history of early embryonic failure (missedabortions and anembryonic pregnancies) and normal karyotype. DNA wasextracted from fetal membranes or chorionic villi and peripheral blood ofabortuses parents. We used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followingPCR amplification for 21 tetranucleotide high polymorphous loci located onseven autosomes. In 1222 parent/abortus allelic transfers 10 isolated STRmismatches in six loci were observed. The mutation rate of was 8.3 x 10 3 per locus per gamete per generation with the prevalence of the malegermline mutations. The study of alleles segregation of other DNA markerspermitted exclusion with high probability non paternity and uniparental dis omy as the possible reasons for parent/abortus mismatches. Together withtwo additional cases of somatic microsatellite mutations which we detect ed in spontaneous abortuses the mean mutation rate of studied tetranu cleotide loci was 9.8 x 10 3 per locus per gamete per generation. This isabout five times higher then the spontaneous mutation rate of this typeSTR loci reported by other authors in normal families. It can be suggestedthat genome instability detected at the level of repeated DNA sequencescan involve not only genetically neutral loci but also active genomic regionscrucial for embryonic viability. However because the mutation rates of dif ferent loci can differ to a marked degree an additional analysis of sponta neous mutation rate of studied loci in normal population is needed as wellas the necessity of further investigation of microsatellite mutation in a larg er sample of families with miscarriages. 428 Posters: Therapy for Genetic DisordersP1667. Human intrachromosomal telomerik like repeats relics of ancestral double strand break repair E. Giulotto1 C. M. Azzalin1 S. G. Nergadze1 N. Archidiacono2 M. Teti2 1University of Pavia Pavia Italy 2University of Bari Bari Italy ', 'Intrachromosomal location of (T2AG3)n telomeric sequences was report ed in different species and several authors proposed that interstitial telom eres (ITs) are relics of ancestral telomeric fusions. Sequence analysis ofabout 70 ITs allowed us to identify three classes (i) short ITs composedby few essentially exact T2AG3 units (ii) subtelomeric ITs composed bylarger arrays (several hundred bp) including degenerate units within sub telomeric domains (iii) fusion ITs in which two extended telomeric stretch es are oriented head to head. Surprisingly only one IT mapping at 2q13 belongs to the fusion class indicating that mechanisms other than thetelomeric fusion generated most human ITs. In particular several short ITsinterrupt precisely repetitive elements or are flanked by direct repeats of10 43 bp. This sequence organization suggested to us that these ITs wereinserted during the repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) that occurred inthe germ line. We sequenced the region homologous to one short IT fromdifferent primate species. In humans this IT extends for 67 bp and isflanked by a 43 bp direct repeat. The telomeric stretch and the directrepeats are conserved in humans chimpanzee and gorilla. Interestingly inorango and in gibbon the IT is missing and the 43 bp repeat is present onlyin one copy. These data unambiguously confirm that the IT was insertedduring evolution through the repair of a staggered DSB that produced 43bp protruding ends. The events leading to the insertion of this IT occurred7 15 m.y.a. between the radiation of the genera Pongo and Gorilla. ",2001
1699,Human Chromosome 21 is conserved in mouse Chromosomes 10 16 and17. To facilitate the construction of appropriate mouse models of Downsyndrome the evolutionary breakpoints between the three conserved seg ments on human chromosome (Chr) 21 were defined. The annotation ofthe complete genomic sequence of Chr 21 was used to identify all genesin the relevant breakpoint regions followed by database searches to iden tify the homologous mouse genes. The mouse T 31 radiation hybrid (RH)panel and PCR primers were used to map these genes to mouse chromo somes. This directly demonstrated the inclusion of two zinc finger genes an ankyrin/kinase gene and an anonymous ORF in the telomeric region ofmouse Chr 16 and places the Chr 16 Chr 17 breakpoint between genesZNF295 and nan,2001
1700, ulm.deSequence analysis has revealed pronounced conservation among thegenomes of higher primates. For example the genome of the chimpanzee(Ptr) is supposed to be more than 98% identical to the human genome. However genetic disparities are assumed to account for the reproductiveisolation and phenotypic separation of the species. The most conspicuousdifferences between the karyotypes of members of the family of Hominidaeare the fusion of great ape chromosomes 12 and 13 changes in hete rochromatin distribution and pericentric inversions. Comparing the G band ed chromosomes of human and chimpanzee nine pericentric inversionsand one insertion but no paracentric inversions or further translocationsare observed. In the case of 5 of these chromosomes with pericentricinversions the inverted regions are large enough and contain several Mbof euchromatin to foster the suspicion that these pericentric inversions hadan effect on reproductive isolation. The molecular definition of pericentricinversions is necessary to address their contribution to human evolutionand to investigate whether the characterization of evolutionary breakpointsprovides insights into general mechanisms of chromosomal rearrange ments. To isolate the genomic regions harbouring pericentric inversion breakpoints we compared the FISH pattern of BAC contigs in the respec tive regions on human chromosome 17 between chimpanzee orangutanand human. We identified BAC clones closely adjacent to and spanningthe inversion breakpoints on the equivalents of chromosome 17 in chim panzee and orangutan. BAC subclones were generated by PCR or restric tion digestion and localized by FISH to further narrow the breakpoints tomore restricted regions. Preliminary results suggest that based on the cor responding human sequence at 17q21.3 a gene should be affected by theinversion resulting in altered genomic organization of that locus comparinghuman and chimpanzee. ,2001

Hemoglo binopathies and thalassemias are the most common single gene diseasesin humans. Their distribution which is geographically localised overlapsthe distribution of monkey populations. We therefore screened 6 monkeyspecies for nucleotide diversity at the ÃÂ§ globin locus. Adult hemoglobin Acomprises two ? and two ÃÂ§ chains. The ? chain locus has two equivalentgenes and ? thalassemias typically result from large deletions. Becausethere are two ? genes and because our methods are optimized for detect ing point mutations we chose to focus on the ÃÂ§ globin locus. Results showthat we can amplify ÃÂ§ globin with human intronic primers in all 6 primatespecies we examined. We defined 6 different allels including one normal in each of three exons in ÃÂ§ globin gene. There were 3 missense 8 silentand 10 intronic alternations close to exon/intron boundary (Figure 1) together 21 alternations. One of the intronic alternations was frame shiftalternation due to T insertion. M. nemestrina is the most diverse of thespecies we studied. For this species 12 alternations were seen across all3 exons. ,2001
1702, halle.deThe human chromosome 20q13 (HSA20q13) segment has been shown tobe syntenic to distal mouse chromosome 2 (MMU2) containing imprintedgenes. In order to refine and expand the syntenic map between MMU2 andHSA20q13 we have generated a human BAC contig of approximately1000 kb in size spanning the area around the anchor markers GNAS1 andEDN3 which is the basis for the identification of novel genes within theregion of interest as candidates for imprinting. Several genes have beenisolated and characterized in terms of structure and expression pattern buttheir function remains unknown since they do not show homology to knowngenes nor proteins. Herewith we introduce two of such candidate geneswhich contain the human EST markers stSG10922 and A005Z17 respec tively. Starting out from stSG10922 a complete cDNA containing a 921 bpORF has been isolated consisting of 9 exons. Northern hybridisationrevealed a transcript of approximately 1 8 kb in size expressed in all tis sues analyzed. In case of the second gene a 3 2 kb transcript was detect ed in brain only. The corresponding cDNA has been isolated containing a1683 bp ORF and deriving from at least 13 exons. For both of these noveltranscripts homologous cDNA clones of the mouse have been isolated.

1703,To elucidate the inheritance patterns of rhythms patterns we used threePosters: Comparative Genetics 429month old BALB/c and C57BL/6J male mice and their F1 progenies. The mice were exposed to 12 12 L D illumination for three weeks. Cis platinum(0.04 mg/mouse) or saline was injected i.p. at (22 HALO) for 10 consecu tive days. On the 11th day 3 mice of each group were sacrificed at equi distant times (during 30 hours). Plasma WBC count and kidney Creatinephosphokinase(CPK) Alkaline phosphatase(AP) and Urea Nitrogen weredetermined. Rhythm parameters were determined and were comparedamong the groups. Results Prior to injection all group exhibited the samecircadian pattern and phase in WBC count. After injection two of the groupsexhibited a semicircadian rhythm and another group exhibited a phasechange. Pre and post injection different changes of the individual rhythmparameters were observed in the two parental strains and their offspringwith regard to AP CPK activity and Urea Nitrogen concentration. . Conclu sions 1. Strain dependent variations in time structure were found in twomice strains and in the F1 progeny albeit the identical entraining condi tions. 2. The stress induced by the drug affected differently the rhythms ofthe examined variables in the three mice groups. 3. Rhythms parameterswere segregated independently from each other in the F1 progenies a factthat suggests the existence of an independent genetic control for each. ,2001
1704,X linked retinitis pigmentosa 3 (XLRP3) a progressive retinal degenera tion is caused by mutations in the retintis pigmentosa GTPase regulator(RPGR ) gene residing in Xp21.1. RPGR transcription studies in man and mouse revealed several alternatively spliced isoforms in different tissues including retina. To further elucidate the genomic structure of this gene andto understand the regulation of tissue specific expression and splicing weperformed comparative genomic sequencing of RPGR and flanking regions in mouse and man. Both genes span nearly 59 kb. All previouslyidentified exons are conserved between the 2 species. In addition morethan 25 conserved regions were found in introns. One of them is identicalto a novel RPGR exon (ORF15) that was reported recently as mutation hotspot. 30% of all our XLRP patients showed frameshift mutations in thissequence. Northern blot analysis with an ORF15 probe revealed highmolecular weight RPGR transcripts (>15 kb) in retina and brain. In con trast the ubiquitously expressed consensus cDNA is only 2.8 kb in lengthand the discrepancy can not be explained by the ORF15 sequence. Fur ther transcription studies are underway in order to isolate additionalexpressed sequences. Our results demonstrate that comparative genomicsequencing enables the discovery of tissue specific exons when ESTs arenot available or in those cases where exon prediction programs fail. More over conserved sequences in RPGR introns represent potential regulato ry elements which are important for alternative splicing or tissue specificgene expression. ,2001

Analysis of ~195 kb of genomic sequence fromthe SOX9 region in the pufferfish Fugu rubripes revealed a similar lowgene content of only five genes. Four of these genes have been mappedin human and all reside on chromosome 17 revealing extensive intra chromosomal gene shuffling when compared to the gene order in Fugu. Inboth species very large intergenic distances separate SOX9 from ist flank ing genes 2 Mb and 500 kb either side of SOX9 in human and 68 kb and94 kb either side of SOX9 in Fugu. Comparative sequence analysis of theintergenic regions revealed five conserved potential regulatory elements E1 E5 up to 290 kb 5ÃÂ« to human SOX9 and up to 18 kb 5ÃÂ« to Fugu SOX9 and three such elements E6 E8 3ÃÂ« to SOX9.From the YAC transgenicdata elements E3 E5 are candidate enhancers for SOX9 expression inlimb and vertebral column and eight of ten CD translocation breakpointsseparate these elements from SOX9.Work is in progress to test the iden tified elements in transgenic mice. ,2001

The common approach in further analyzing such data An exciting promise of pharmacogenomics research is to develop gene is to first subtract the background from the foreground for each channel tests that will predict which individuals are at increased risk of side effects and to use the ratio of these two results as the estimate of the expression and which individuals will benefit most from each specific drug. Association level. The resulting ratios are after possible averaging over replicates the studies are often used. Atarget group is selected (eg those with abnormal usual inputs for further data analysis such as clustering. If with this back drug clearance and/ or side effects) and they are compared with a control ground correction procedure the foreground intensity was smaller than the group with no side effects or normal clearance. We discuss the issues background intensity for a channel that spot (on that array) yields no relating to selecting these groups and what sample size is required. It is usable data. In this paper it is argued that this preprocessing leads to esti important to know the population distribution of the polymorphisms being mates of the expression that have a much larger variance than needed studied and if possible select the control group from this population so the when the expression levels are low. design becomes a nested case control study.

The dog is wellsuited as a model system for a variety of human diseases as e.g. the spinalmuscular atrophy arthritis progressive retinal atrophies or von Willebrand disease. Furthermore dogs can produce a huge offspring during their lifeproviding geneticists with large well documented pedigrees impossible toobtain in human studies. Even several examples of gene therapy of canine diseases have already been reported. On the other hand molecular genet ic tools allowing for a more advanced knowledge of canine moleculargenetics are far behind of what we know for humans. We established acDNA library from canine testis tissue and picked random clones for analy sis. By sequencing and characterizing 600 clones we could show that thehomology between man and dog is much higher as the so far estimated80%. The characterized clones showed an homology of 85% 100% tohuman genes or ESTs. In addition we compared sequence homologies ofopen reading frames and 3 UTRs separately.
