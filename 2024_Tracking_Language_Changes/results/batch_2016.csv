24899,"RAS genes have attracted a significant deal of attention in biomedical re search due to central their role in mediating mitogenic signaling and to their oncogenic activation in at least one third of all human cancers including some of the most frequent and malignant tumor types such as colorectal carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. More recently, Ras genes have also been implicated in developmental disor ders including Costello and Noonan syndromes. In spite of the wealth of in formation accumulated over the last 30+ years on these genes we still have rather scant information regarding how their misregulation affects human health. More importantly, as of today, there are no efficacious inhibitors to treat those diseases caused by mutations or alterations in RAS genes. Our laboratory has been interested in the development of genetically modified (GEM) animal models that faithfully reproduce the natural history of these diseases and in the identification and subsequent validation of targets with potential therapeutic value. I will describe our GEM models for Costello (H Ras G12V) and Noonan (K RasI14V) syndromes along with our efforts to validate potential therapeutic strategies to correct their developmental defects. I will also describe our new generation of GEM models for K Ras mutant lung and pancreatic tumors and review the genetic approaches that we are utilizing to validate the therapeutic value of each of the kinases involved in the MAPK signaling cascade, the key pathway involved in K Ras oncogenic signaling. We hope that these studies will serve to guide the design of future clinical trails to treat people suffering from Rasopathy syndromes as well as cancer patients carrying K RAS mutant tumors.",2016
24900,"The retinal dystrophies (RDs) are degenerative diseases involving RPE and/or photoreceptors of the retina and currently without treatment options for the patients. RD may be syndromic or non syndromic and can affect pe ripheral, central retina or both. They affect about 1:4,000 individuals and there are more than 270 known causative genes loci. Mendelian (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X linked inheritance) and non mendelian inheritance have been described. This great clinical and genetic heterogeneity and the need for a genetic dia gnosis to help and refine clinical management and guide genetic counseling are a real challenge. Two decades ago, we started the study of RD in Spain (EsREtNet: AntiÃÂ±olo, Baiget, Carballo, Millan, Valverde & Ayuso). The modes of inheritance fre quency were established (15% Syndromic; and 12% dominant, 39% reces sive, 4% Xlinked and 41% sporadic cases and 4% unclassified Clin Genet. 1995 ) and the first mutated genes (RHO, CRB1, USH2A, etc) affecting Spa nish population were identified, using gene mutation screening approaches (SSCP , dHPLC) or Sanger sequencing. From 2007, we used array based primer extension (APEX) technology, with a diagnostic yield from 14% (for autosomal dominant RD; Blanco Kelly et al; Mol Vis 2012 ) to 54% (for Stargardt cases; Riveiro et al IOVS 2012 ) in RD patients. In 2011 new genomic analysis technologies, including next generation se quencing (NGS) and chromosome microarrays were implemented. In total 36% of the Ã¢ÂÂ3000 RD families were characterized and we identified new mutations and genes, and clinical associations. Molecular characterization allowed us to refine clinical diagnosis, to con firm or change the pattern of inheritance, improving clinical management of RD cases and families. Moreover, we have established very well characte rized cohorts of USH2A, NR2E3, RHO, XLRS, CHM or ABCA4 patients, useful for natural history of disease studies. Additionally, mutated cases for RPE65, PDEA, among others can be offered to be included in current clinical trials. At present, a more accurate and efficient algorithms for molecular diagno sis are available for RD patients to improve their clinical care, however we need still to improve the diagnosis rate and fill the gap to obtain effective therapies. International collaborative efforts for research on molecular, epidemiologi cal and therapeutic aspects are needed to achieve these goalsPL2 WhatÃ¢ÂÂs New? Highlight Sessio",2016
24901,"To date their detection has been limited to cytogenetic resolution as most first tier genetic screening methods are blind to their presence. We defined the genomic landscape of de novo BCAs associated with human congenial anomalies in 235 subjects using whole genome sequencing. We observed that 22% of all BCAs harbored additional cryptic complexity, ranging from three breakpoints to chromothripsis events involving up to 57 breakpoints. Compared to random expectations, BCAs were more likely to occur between loci in close physical proximity in the nucleus, and their breakpoints were significantly enriched for evolutionarily constrained and embryonically ex pressed genes. From our convergent genomic interpretation using orthogo nal datasets, we predict that the congenital anomaly phenotype was likely attributable to the BCA in at least 30% of subjects. An additional 4% of BCAs disrupted long range regulatory regions such as topologically associating domains (TADs) resulting in position effects on genes associated with spe cific clinical manifestations that were compatible with the proband sequen ced here. Remarkably, we observed a cluster of six independent transloca tions that disrupted a TAD and consequently altered MEF2C expression, mimicking the 5q14.3 microdeletion syndrome. These results suggest that de novo BCAs represent a highly penetrant class of genomic variation asso ciated with congenital anomalies, and that nucleotide resolution offers in sights into phenotypic prediction from direct gene disruption and alteration of long range regulatory domains that are likely to be a significant source of causal variation in human disease.",2016
24902,"Mammalian genomes are organized in distinctly folded chromatin modu les, called topologically associated domains (TADs) that are separated from each other by boundary regions. TADs subdivide the genome into discrete chromatin domains that direct the contacts enhancers can establish with their target genes. How copy number variations interfere with TAD structu re and how this might contribute to human disease, is not well understood. ABSTRACTS PLENARY LECTURES ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 5Back to index Here, we analyze partially overlapping duplications at the SOX9 locus, which are associated with a limb malformation (Cooks syndrome), sex reversal or no abnormality in humans. By analyzing patient cells and corresponding mouse models with chromosome conformation capture assays, we show that large duplications spanning a TAD boundary result in the formation of a novel chromatin domain, or neo TAD. The formation of this neo TAD ex plains the divergent phenotypes of the overlapping duplications at the SOX9 locus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the duplicated cis regulatory in formation is functionally isolated and does not influence genes outside the neo TAD. Instead, the pathogenicity of duplications depends on the combi nation of genes and cis regulatory information that are contained within the neo TAD. Taken together, our results show that duplications including TAD boundary regions can result in the formation of novel chromatin domains that are functionally and spatially separated from their genomic neighbors. Moreover, our findings provide a framework for interpreting the pathogenic effect of genomic duplications, frequently detected in patients with congeni tal malformations, intellectual disability or cancer.",2016
24903,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCCs) is the most common human cancer, resulting from aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway. While most cases are sporadic, some forms are inherited, as in Bazex DuprÃÂ© Christol syndro me (BDCS), an X linked dominant cancer prone genodermatosis. Studying a series of 6 BDCS families, we found mutations in the ACTRT1 gene, encoding the Arp T1 protein, in 2/6 BDCS families, and absent expression of Arp T1 in BDCS tumors and most of sporadic BCCs. High throughput sequencing revealed germline mutations in non coding sequences, belong to a new class of enhancers (eRNA), surrounding ACTRT1 in the remaining families. Muta tions reduced expression of the specific eRNAs and their enhancer capacity. Using Crispr Cas9 technology, we demonstrated that induced mutations in these enhancers significantly decreased the expression of Arp T1 protein. When stably expressed in MDA MB231 breast cancer and U2OS osteosar coma cell lines, wild type ACTRT1 reduced cell proliferation and migration. Consistently, xenografts of ACTRT1 MDA MB231 and ACTRT1 U2OS cells in nude mice demonstrated that ACTRT1 normally inhibits tumor growth. In deed, transcriptomic analyses revealed that ACTRT1 could modulate the ex pression of genes involved in regulation of cell cycle progression, cell death and survival or cell migration. Finally, Arp T1 acts as a tumor suppressor via its direct binding to Hedgehog signaling target genes, thus inhibiting their expression. Our study identifies a novel mechanism accounting for hereditary and spo radic BCCs, and suggests that ACTRT1 may be potential therapeutic targets in oncology.

24904,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) has proven to be useful for the identifica tion of the molecular basis of heterogeneous conditions such as intellectual disability with congenital anomalies. A large number of results remain non conclusive, especially when facing ultra rare conditions that limit genotype phenotype correlations. International data sharing catalyzes the identifica tion of additional cases and allows the delineation of new syndromes. We report on a female patient with developmental delay, moderate in tellectual disability, facial dysmorphism and severe constipation. Af ter a negative diagnostic work up, a proband clinical WES was perfor med and pinpointed a de novo acceptor splice variant of MSL3 was (NM_001193270.1:c.1345+1G>T). To assess the relevance of this finding we asked international collaborators for patients with truncating variants of MSL3. Seven unrelated individuals from France, UK, the Netherlands, Ger many, USA were identified with de novo single nucleotide variants (4/7), whole gene de novo deletions (2/7) or chromosomic inversion causing a fusion transcript of MSL3 and GAB3 genes (1/7). Clinical findings of patients with point mutation are very similar but less recognizable in patients with chromosomal anomalies. This include speech and walk delay, intellectual disability, neonatal hypotonia, facial dysmorphism, abnormal limbs, abdo minal symptoms and cutaneous anomalies. The MSL3 gene, located on the X chromosome, encodes a subunit of a transcriptional regulator complex responsible of lysine 16 of histone H4 acetylation (H4K16ac). Functional studies revealed a decreasing of H4K16ac mark and complex assembly de fects. In conclusion, we delineate a new syndrome of the epigenetic machi nery characterized by neurodevelopmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies.",2016
24905,"Introduction Since 2012, haplotype assisted noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) has been developed in our laboratory, and validated in a number of monogenic diseases using clinical samples from trio families. The purpose of this study was to summarize the performance of this method in different monogenic diseases. Method and MaterialCustomized panels were designed to capture the coding region and flanking area of disease associated genes. Genomic DNA from each trio family (fa ther, pregnant mother, and proband child) and plasma cell free DNA from each pregnant mother was targeted sequenced using the customized pa nels. Fetal fraction was calculated with the differently homozygous SNPs in both parents. Parental and fetal haplotype were deduced based on genetic information from the trio family and Hidden Markov Model. Amniocentesis was performed to confirm NIPD results. Result97 trio families covering 12 monogenic diseases have been tested before receiving prenatal diagnosis (Table). The mutations consisted of point mu tations and copy number variants. Mean gestational age of pregnant women while receiving NIPD was 18 weeks. Fetal fraction was between 2.8% to 22.6%, with the mean of 9.1%. 60 pregnancies were identified as disease affected. So far amniotic fluid was tested for prenatal diagnosis in 70 preg nancies, all consistent to NIPD results. ConclusionHaplotype assisted NIPD showed high accuracy in predicting the existence of fetal monogenic disease, and can be used in different diseases and muta tion types.

24906,"Introduction: De novo mutations (DNMs) originating in gametogenesis are an important source of genetic variation and can cause human disease. Here, we investigate the properties of DNM on paternal and maternal alleles in order to understand the underlying mechanisms. Methods: We applied whole genome sequencing to a cohort of 816 parent offspring trios, yielding in 35,793 autosomal single nucleotide DNMs. Ha plotype assembly could resolve the parental origin of 7,216 DNMs. We com pare parental age effects, genomic regions and spectra of paternal versus maternal DNMs. Results: Our results show that the number of DNMs in offspring increases not only with paternal age (0.9 DNMs/year), but also with maternal age (0.24 DNMs/year). The genome regions with highest enrichment for ma ternally derived DNMs are the known fragile sites FRA8B and FRA16D. We identify parent of origin specific mutation signatures that become more pronounced with increased parental age, with transitions in A. G context being the most biased mutations. Moreover, we find DNMs that are spatially clustered to have a unique mutational signature with no significant diffe rences between parental alleles, suggesting a different mutational mecha nism. Conclusions: We find that the different biology of male and female gameto genesis gives rise to distinct mutational patterns. These patterns are valuab le to understand physiology and pathology of the human germ line. PL3 My vision on genomic medicine",2016

24909,"The word epigenetics excites great interest within biology and beyond, despite uncertainty about its definition. At one level it concerns the signi ficance of the plethora of chemical marks on chromosomes that modulate gene activity (collectively known as the Ã¢ÂÂepigenomeÃ¢ÂÂ). Prominent among these marks is DNA methylation a modification that is directly applied to DNA and affects its interaction with proteins. Several clinical disorders invol ve genes that interpret or lay down the epigenome. For example, the autism spectrum disorders Rett syndrome and MECP2 duplication syndrome are caused by mutations in the gene for the protein MeCP2. The MeCP2 protein binds to sites on DNA that are chemically altered by DNA methylation and appears to interpret this Ã¢ÂÂepigeneticÃ¢ÂÂ mark to affect gene expression. Clues to the function of MeCP2 are provided by the spectrum of mutations causing Rett syndrome and the biochemical and genetic analyses. Recent evidence derived from animal and cellular models suggests that the primary function of this protein is to restrain transcription in a DNA methylation dependent manner. Interestingly, the resulting defects are reversible in model systems suggesting that the disorder may be curable. Current research addressing these aspects of MeCP2 biology will be presented.

24910,"Despite the rhetoric of precision medicine afforded through advances in ge netic technologies, and a common perception that genetic tests offer clear cut predictions, the reality in 2016 remains far from this in all but a few di stinct areas. Whole genome approaches do provide novel diagnoses or pre dictions in some families where all previous targeted genetic investigations drew a blank, but for many others the clinical significance of findings from new genetic technologies is unknown until much more evidence be that bioinformatic or clinical follow up can be gathered. One of the problems for practice is that the inversion of the phenotype to genotype approach pre viously used in genetic clinics, to predicting phenotypes from geno[me]ty pes is a quantitative qualitative as well as quantitative leap. This has impor tant implications for how we seek consent for, for example, whole genome sequencing. We can no longer expect patients to be able to have considered all the possible outcomes from such testing in any detail as part of a consent process. Indeed as genomic medicine becomes a mainstream activity, dis covery of genomic predispositions to disease that lies outside the clinical experience of the consenter will become more common place. Is Ã¢ÂÂfully in formedÃ¢ÂÂ consent a desirable goal in genomic testing? Or should we instead begin to focus on mechanisms that engender greater trust in the venture in question? Using the example of Ã¢ÂÂincidentalÃ¢ÂÂ findings from genomic testing, I will explore whether we are placing too much emphasis on consent as a gateway to testing and whether this, perhaps paradoxically, carries the risk of accusations of paternalism. Consent to genomic testing with a full under standing of all the possible outcomes and consequences will not be possible so we will need to consider how best to obtain broad or generic consent to testing that is realistic about the uncertainties and builds in mechanisms for revised interpretation in the wake of new knowledge.",2016

SchizophreniaÃ¢ÂÂs strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been chal lenging to identify. Here we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) ge nes. We found that these alleles generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse elimination during postnatal development.

These methods enable decomposing single cell heterogeneity into biologi cal divers, confounding factors and genetic effects. One of the main challen ges when linking genetic variation with single cell states is that most studies profiles cells from very few distinct genetic backgrounds.

24915,"Family history of cancer is one of the strongest predictors of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, being this risk higher with increasing number of affec ted relatives and when CRC occurs at young age. Crude estimates indicate that 20 25% of all CRC patients have at least one relative affected with the disease, which may be explained by shared genetic and/or environmental factors. Approximately 3 6% of all CRC patients carry germline mutations associated with syndromic hereditary colorectal cancer. This genetic pre disposition to CRC has been classically associated with germline mutations (and epimutations) in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2 , MSH6 and ABSTRACTS SYMPOSIA ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

Despite this knowledge, much of the genetic predis position to CRC remains unexplained. The identification of a germline mutation that causes the increased risk and aggregation of CRC in a family has clear consequences in the clinical ma nagement of its members. Therefore, important efforts are being invested to identify novel genes that explain this predisposition, in particular in fa milies with clear dominant inheritance of the disease. In the last decade, the rapid development and decrease in the economic cost of massively parallel sequencing based approaches and genome wide copy number techniques has allowed the identification of novel genes responsible of hereditary CRC cases, in some instances also associated with polyposis. For some of the identified genes, the evidence gathered to date is robust and their testing has been included in routine genetic diagnostics, while for others, the iden tification of additional pathogenic mutations in high risk families is manda tory to provide the required evidence to consider the study of the gene in the clinical setting.

24916,"Family and twin studies indicate that cutaneous melanoma (CM) suscep tibility has a strong genetic component. CM sometimes runs in families in which there is an inherited mutation in a single Ã¢ÂÂhigh penetranceÃ¢ÂÂ gene, but in the general population CM predisposition is likely governed by variati on in a combination of Ã¢ÂÂlow penetranceÃ¢ÂÂ genes. To date, genome wide asso ciation studies (GWAS) have identified 20 low penetrance loci associated with CM susceptibility in populations of European descent. The majority of these loci are related to well characterised CM risk phenotypes of light pig mentation and high numbers of melanocytic naevi. They include variants in or near pigmentation genes: MC1R, ASIP , TYR, SLC45A2, OCA2, IRF4 and TYRP1; and genes associated with naevus count: MTAP/CDKN2A, PLA2G6, IRF4 and TERT/CLPTM1L. Ten additional melanoma susceptibility loci not associated with either of these risk phenotypes have been identified. These lie in or near ATM, CASP8, CCND1, MX2, FTO, PARP1, AGR3, CDKAL1, RAD23B and SETDB1, suggesting a number of other pathways are involved in mela noma susceptibility. The ATM and PARP1 loci allude to involvement of DNA repair, while CCND1 and CASP1 point to regulation of cell proliferation or death respectively. High penetrance germline mutations in the CDKN2A and CDK4 genes account for susceptibility in ~40% of case dense CM families. Recently, exome sequencing has identified several new familial CM genes. Initial success was the finding of a variant (p. E318K) in MITF, the lineage specific transcription factor and oncogene for melanoma, which was 2.33 times more prevalent in melanoma cases than population controls, indi cating it is a medium penetrance melanoma susceptibility variant. Subse quently, the identification of rare germline gain of function mutations in the promoter of TERT, as well as inactivating mutations in genes encoding the shelterin components POT1, ACD and TERF2IP , implicate telomere dysregu lation as a novel risk pathway in familial melanoma. Additionally, mutations in BAP1 have been associated both with CM and uveal melanoma (UM) pre disposition, as well as susceptibility to mesothelioma and a range of other cancers. BAP1 is currently the only documented high penetrance UM gene, however it is responsible for susceptibility in only ~5% of UM families, therefore other as yet unidentified familial UM genes are likely to exist. In contrast to CM, there have been no GWAS for UM to date. A worldwide col laborative effort is needed to establish such an endeavour to increase our understanding of UM genetics.

24917,"Next generation genetics builds bridges between clinical research and population biobanks. Many diseases are multifactorial in origin, implying that they are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental com ponents. To date, common genetic variants have been identified associated with almost every multifactorial disease or trait. Nevertheless the relation between carrying genetic risk factors and disease outcome is not clear cut as some people develop disease while others are resilient despite carrying many genetic risk alleles. Population based prospective cohort studies fol low individuals before the onset of disease, allowing for studies that can identify biomarkers and disease modifying effects (including protective factors). The LifeLines Cohort Study is a large population based cohort stu dy and biobank that was established as a resource for research on complex interactions between environmental, phenotypic and genomic factors in the development of multifactorial diseases. Baseline phenotypes, biochemi stry and dietary data have been collected for 167,729 participants, aged 6 months to 93 years. Genetic information by GWAS is available for about 10% of the cohort. From a subset of approx. 1500 individuals (LifeLinesDEEP) more detailed genomic data was collected including genome wide RNAseq, methylation, metabolomics and gut metagenomics, allowing us to investiga te the intricate relationship between host genetics, diet and gut microbiome on the susceptibility to multifactorial diseases. Based on RNAseq data we are able to assess which common genetic risk variants impact the expressi on of nearby (cis eQTL) or distant (trans eQTLs) genes, even in a context dependent manner by deconvolution of the data into different blood cell types. Allele specific expression (ASE) even allows investigation of single patients from clinical families. A comprehensive analysis of the gut microbi ome revealed strong associations with dietary habits, life style, medication use and health parameters. We showed for example that the use of proton pump inhibitors one of the most widely used drugs in Western populations lead to a less healthy gut microbiome. We also showed that the gut micro biome plays a larger role in the variation in body mass index and blood lipid levels than host genetics. Our study supports the potential of microbiota modifying intervention by diet, prebiotics or probiotics to prevent or treat multifactorial diseases.

24918,"Identification of rare and low frequency variants is possible by whole ge nome sequencing, but to assure enough statistical power for analyses seve ral thousands of individuals have to be sequenced, at a cost that is still not negligible. An alternative cost effective approach is to integrate genotyping arrays data for a large number of individuals with a reference set of sequen ced genomes, either using public resources or by direct sequencing a subset of the study samples. The benefits of the latter strategy are expected to be higher for homogenous populations, especially in isolates, as there are fe wer haplotypes to be tracked down, and also because rare and less frequent alleles may have raised in frequency due to genetic drift or selection. We have generated a Sardinian specific reference panel for imputation by low pass whole genome sequencing of to up to 3514 Sardinians, and used this panel to impute a cohort of 6,602 Sardinian individuals genotyped at ~900K SNPs. We observed that efficiency of imputation was remarkably higher when compared to inferences made with existing public resources, and that low frequency and rare variants could be predicted with proper precision. Inferred genotypes were subsequently tested for association with several quantitative traits, revealing that this genotyping combined with populati on specific sequencing approach provides not only an average benefit in ac curacy, but also leads to the discovery of novel associations that would have been missed otherwise. Novel associated loci showing strong differences in frequency and linkage disequilibrium patterns compared to populations in 1000 Genomes or at which the causative variant was absent from the publi cly available reference panels were indeed misplaced or completely missed when a non Sardinian source of haplotypes was used for imputation. Over all, these results demonstrate the benefits of a population specific panel in Sardinians for complex traits genetics. ABSTRACTS SYMPOSIA ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

In particular, the success in noninvasive prenatal testing using cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has demon strated the power of this approach. We have ongoing efforts to explore the applicability of a similar approach for the noninvasive detection of cancer, using genomewide plasma DNA sequencing. Using this approach, we have found that cancer associated copy number aberrations and methylation ab errations can be detected in a genomewide manner in the plasma of cancer patients. We have also demonstrated that circulating tumor derived DNA is shorter than that from non tumor tissue in plasma. Very recently, we have shown that by using over 5800 methylation markers showing tissue specific methylation changes, one can profile the origin of DNA in plasma. Using this approach, one can pinpoint the tissue of origin of an observed plasma DNA aberration, thus helping one to localize the site of a putative cancer. This technology, called plasma DNA tissue mapping, has also shed light on the origin of circulating DNA in healthy subjects. In this regard, we have shown that most of the circulating DNA in healthy subjects is derived from myeloid and lymphoid cells. We believe that plasma tissue mapping has diagnostic applications in many other clinical scenarios associated with cell death phe nomena. S06 Behavioural disorder",2016
24920,"Autism is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that afflicts approxi mately 1% of live births. It is characterized by deficits in language, social in teraction and repetitive behaviors. I will summarize our findings regarding the discovery of genetic mutations and their contribution to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental delay (DD). I will present evidence from exome and molecular inversion probe sequencing of more than 10,000 children with simplex autism and show how these data may be used to pin point specific genes. The emerging data strongly argue that the develop ment of the human brain is particularly sensitive to the timing and expres sion of many different genes; multiple genetic perturbations within specific neurodevelopmental pathways related to long term potentiation, chromatin remodeling, synaptic function and Wnt signaling appear particularly impor tant; and that the maternal and paternal contributions differ significantly. I will present data on how grouping patients based on a specific gene can be used to predict clinical subtypes of autism. Next generation exome and ge nome sequencing data provide a powerful path forward for understanding the genetic architecture of these diseases but the heterogeneity demands an unprecedented level of global cooperation and networking.",2016
24921,"A key challenge in understanding autism is to establish whether this gene tically heterogeneous disorder is caused by common mechanisms. Tran scriptomic profiling has revealed consistently altered signatures in autistic brains. These include a program of 3 27 nucleotide Ã¢ÂÂmicroexonsÃ¢ÂÂ, which is misregulated in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Relative to all other types of alternative splicing, microexons display the most striking evolutionary conservation and switch like regulation during neuronal differentiation. These microexons modulate the function of inter action domains of proteins involved in neurogenesis and are modulated by neuronal activity. Most neural microexons are regulated by the neuronal specific splicing factor nSR100/SRRM4 through its binding to adjacent in tronic enhancer motifs, and reduced levels of this protein are also observed in autistic brains. Collectively, these results provide evidence that misregu lation of a splicing network affected by neuronal activity is associated with associated with autism spectrum disorder.",2016

In this presentation, I will summarize the progress in identifying schizophrenia as sociated variants from a diverse set of study designs based on published and unpublished data, show that they appear to converge on proteins involved in various facets of synaptic biology, and highlight work showing that some of the risk alleles have manifestations that are apparent in early childhood.

24924,"Mammalian cell nuclei contain three RNA polymerases (I, II, and III), each transcribing a different gene subset. The active forms of these polymerases are contained in supra molecular complexes known as Ã¢ÂÂtranscription fac toriesÃ¢ÂÂ. These complexes harbor >95% of nuclear transcriptional activity, and are embedded in the 3D structure of the nucleus. We recently descri bed a novel method by which the protein and RNA contents of transcription factories can be isolated and analyzed in a high throughput fashion. Using these approaches we may now directly interrogate aspects of mammalian transcriptional organization that remain elusive. For example, using nas cent RNA isolated from factories, we were able to show for the first time that many human introns are spliced in a recursive manner. This molecular mechanism utilizes cryptic, non canonical, sites embedded in introns. The tight association of these sites with intragenic cis regulatory elements, and potentially with underlying genetic variants, suggest a whole new way by which results from both genetic and functional studies should now be ap proached.

24926,"Since the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s, genetic te sting, selection and screening have been considered to be ethically justi fiable and allowed under most jurisdictions, but genetic modification of the human germline has for many been an ethical line that should not be crossed. Germline modification encompasses any biomedical intervention that modifies the genome that a person can transmit to his or her child and the childÃ¢ÂÂs entire lineage. Until recently, the technological tools that enable a viable path to realizing human germline modification were not available. However, two recent scientific developments have revived the international discussion on the ethics of germline modification and underscore the need to address the ethics and governance of human germline modification now. First, UK parliament recently legalized a novel reproductive genetic techno logy to prevent mitochondrial DNA disorders: mitochondrial replacement techniques. Now both the technological barriers as well as the policy bar riers for MRT are considerably lowered, at least in the UK, the first clinical use is expected shortly. This would encompass a modification of the mito chondrial genome. Second, recent advances in genome editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 make it possible to edit DNA sequences in virtually any organism of choice. In April 2015, Chinese scientists published the first report of the use of gene editing techniques for basic research in human embryos. Gene editing experiments in human embryos have now been ap proved in China, the UK and Sweden. These developments have sparked an international ethical debate. Leading scientific journals Nature and Science rejected the first Chinese publication for ethical reasons and published commentaries that called for an international moratorium. Others view the continuation of basic gene editing research on human embryos as a Ã¢ÂÂmoral imperativeÃ¢ÂÂ for its offers the future potential of correcting genetic disease, many of which are currently untreatable. Many, among which myself as a member of the Hinxton Group, emphasized the need for ethical and public deliberation about emerging genome editing techniques and (international) oversight.

24928,"Linkage analyses of large families affected by autosomal dominant primary familial brain calcification (PFBC; formerly known as idiopathic basal gan glia calcification (IBGC)) identified three candidate loci (named IBGC1 3). In 2012, mutations in SLC20A2 were found within the IBGC3 locus. In the following years, using next generation sequencing, three further PFBC ge nes (PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1) were discovered and the respective disease forms were subsequently designated as IBGC4 6. A systematic search of the MEDLINE database for articles published until 2014 for the three genes with more than one report in the literature (SLC2012, PDGFRB, and PDGFB) and a search of individual reference lists of all identified articles left 15 re ports of genetically confirmed cases with individual clinical information. A total of 179 cases were reported, including 162 individuals who belonged to 25 families. Availability of information ranged from 96.6% for ethnicity to 24.4% for age at onset. All cases, regardless of which of the three genes was mutated, had calcifications on comprehensive cranial computed tomogra phy, most frequently located in the basal ganglia (70.6%), subcortical white matter (40.8%), cerebellum (34.1%), or thalamus (28.5%). Mean (SD) AAO was 27.9 (22.3) years, and the AAO was likewise comparable across genes (P , .77). The most frequently described clinical signs were movement dis orders, such as parkinsonism (12%) and dystonia (19%). Penetrance of the imaging phenotype was 100% compared with only 61% of the clinical phenotype.

24929,"The pilot phase of the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has pro duced RNASeq from 1,641 samples originated from up to 43 tissues from 175 post mortem donors, and constitutes a unique resource to investigate the human transcriptome across tissues and individuals. Clustering of samples based on gene expression recapitulates tissue types, separating solid from not solid tissues, while clustering based on splicing separates neural from non neural tissues, suggesting that post transcriptional regulation plays a comparatively important role in the definition of neural tissues .About 47 % of the variation in gene expression can be explained by variation of across tissues, while only 4% by variation across individuals. We find that the rela tive contribution of individual variation is similar for lncRNAs and for pro tein coding genes. However, we find that genes that vary with ethnicity are enriched in lncRNAs, whereas genes that vary with age are mostly protein coding. Among genes that vary with gender, we find novel candidates both to participate and to escape X inactivation. In addition, by merging informa tion on GWAS we are able to identify specific candidate genes that may ex plain differences in susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases between males and females and different ethnic groups. We find that genes that decrease with age are involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer and identify novel candidates that could be involved in these di seases. In contrast to gene expression, splicing varies similarly among tissu es and individuals, and exhibits a larger proportion of residual unexplained variance. This may reflect that that stochastic, non functional fluctuations of the relative abundances of splice isoforms may be more common than random fluctuations of gene expression. By comparing the variation of the abundance of individual isoforms across all GTEx samples, we find that a lar ge fraction of this variation between tissues (84%) can be simply explained by variation in bulk gene expression, with splicing variation contributing comparatively little. This strongly suggests that regulation at the primary transcription level is the main driver of tissue specificity. Although blood is the most transcriptionally distinct of the surveyed tissues, RNA levels moni tored in blood may retain clinically relevant information that can be used to help assess medical or biological conditions.",2016

Despite rapid growth it remains incomplete, both in terms of missing gene structure elements (splice sites, exons, transcription start and termination sites) in annotated genes, as well as unknown numbers of unannotated genes. To address both issues, we are applying RNA Capture methodology coupled to Third Generation long read sequencing (Ã¢ÂÂCapture Long SeqÃ¢ÂÂ, CLS) in both Human and Mouse. We have designed capture libraries that target (a) the entire set of known intergenic lncRNA genes, and (b) thousands of regions suspected to harbour unannotated lncRNA based on small RNA, enhancer, conservation or orthology evidence. Analysis of > 2 million complete long reads of captured RNA from 6 tissues deepens known lncRNA annotations several times over: using conservati ve filters, the set of canonical lncRNA splice junctions increases by 250%. Around 80% of lncRNAs are detected, at a mean depth of 70 reads. We ob serve numerous cases of new exons, unified gene models underlying mul tiple annotations, and mono exonic genes. Taking advantage of long read information, we also map 132,305 polyadenylation sites genome wide.

24931,"Sexual reproduction is an ancient feature of life on earth, and the familiar X and Y chromosomes in humans and other model species have led to the impression that sex determination mechanisms are old and conserved. In fact, males and females are determined by diverse mechanisms that evolve rapidly in many taxa. Yet this diversity in primary sex determining signals is coupled with conserved molecular pathways that trigger male or female development. Conflicting selection on different parts of the genome and on the two sexes may drive many of these transitions, but few systems with rapid turnover of sex determination mechanisms have been rigorously stu died. I will discuss our current understanding of how and why sex deter mination evolves in animals and plants and identify important gaps in our knowledge that present exciting research opportunities to characterize the evolutionary forces and molecular pathways underlying the evolution of sex determination.",2016
24932,"Y chromosomes underlie sex determination in mammals, but their repeat rich nature has hampered sequencing and associated evolutionary studies. In an ongoing project, we are tracing Y functional evolution across represen tative mammals based on various types of high throughput sequencing data. We previously uncovered three independent sex chromosome originations in mammals and birds (the outgroup). The original placental and marsupial (therian) Y, containing the sex determining gene SRY, emerged in the theri an ancestor approximately 180Ã¢ÂÂmillion years ago, in parallel with the first of five monotreme Y chromosomes, carrying the probable sex determining gene AMH. The avian W chromosome arose approximately 140Ã¢ÂÂmillion years ago in the bird ancestor. The small Y/W gene repertoires, enriched in regula tory functions, were rapidly defined following stratification (recombination arrest) and erosion events and have remained considerably stable. Despite expression decreases in therians, Y/W genes show notable conservation of proto sex chromosome expression patterns, although various Y genes evol ved testis specificities through differential regulatory decay. Thus, although some genes evolved novel functions through spatial/temporal expression shifts, most Y genes probably endured, at least initially, because of dosage constraints.

24933,"Intraspecific variability in social organization is common, yet the underlying causes are rarely known. In this talk I will show tha, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a pair of hete romorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chro mosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approxi mately 13 megabases (55% of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. The lack of recombination can be explained by at least one large inversion, and this absence of recombi nation has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including re petitive elements in the non recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearran gements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination. <!

24935,"More than one half billion people are obese. Though substantial progress is being made in understanding genetic predisposition for obesity, much of the high heritability for the disease remains enigmatic. Our lab focuses on understanding how chromatin state biases can be established to generate or modify disease susceptibility. We have begun to dissect how core chro matin regulatory systems can impact metabolic phenotypes, their variabi lity and their distribution. In a first study, we have identified a paradigm of paternal diet induced intergenerational metabolic reprogramming (IGMR). We find that diet can act as a physiological suppressor of variegation, capab le of selectively modifying genomic output for the lifetime of the offspring individuals. This occurs in a chromatin state specified manner and controls transcriptome signatures in mature sperm of the father and in offspring em bryos. This model has allowed us to identify Polycomb and core hertero chromatin machinery as required for the manifestation of intergenerational metabolic reprogramming (Ost, Cell 2014). In a second study, we identify a Trim28 sensitive epigenetic switch that triggers obesity stochastically and in an apparently Ã¢ÂÂOn/OffÃ¢ÂÂ manner. Using genetic dissection and transcripto me analyses, we map this phenotype to control of a series of metabolically potent imprinted genes. We find that human children present in similarly distinct sub populations stratifying by Trim28 expression, imprinted gene dysregulation, and profoundly distinct transcriptome organization (Dalg aard Cell 2016). To the best of our knowledge, the latter data provide the first evidence of polyphenism in mouse and humans and break major as sumptions made in our understanding of complex trait genetics, evolution and medicine.

They can ensure resilience against environmental change, but also allow adaptation. Nowhere is this more important than in the gamete and the early embryo. We are seeking to understand what governs how DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks are patterned during gametogene sis and embryogenesis. Using mouse as a model, we have shown that tran scription is the major determinant of the DNA methylation landscape in the oocyte. To understand the mechanistic connection between transcription and de novo methylation, we have profiled histone modifications in growing oocytes and identify chromatin states permissive for and resistant to DNA methylation characterised by reciprocal enrichment of H3K4me2/me3 and H3K36me3. This finding is reinforced by the consequences on the DNA me thylation landscape of genetically ablating specific H3K4 demethylases and methyltransferases. Key to such studies is the development of methods for genome wide profiling of epigenetic marks in low numbers of cells, inclu ding at the single cell level, which could have application widely in epige netic studies, particularly for rare cell types and for investigating cell to cell heterogeneity in epigenetic marks at critical developmental transitions.

Despite its importance, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms, transcriptio nal pathways, cellular interactions, as well as the spatio temporal develop ment of the embryo at implantation stages is at present lacking, due to the embryoÃ¢ÂÂs inaccessibility.

24938,"After fertilization, massive oocyte RNA degradation takes place, followed by a cascade like activation of transcription from the embryo genome (Embryo Genome Activation, EGA). We have characterized human EGA by single cell RNA sequencing of over 340 oocytes, zygotes and isolated blastomeres from 4 cell and 8 cell stage embryos, focusing on the transcription start sites (TSS) using the STRT method (TÃÂ¶hÃÂ¶nen, Katayama & al. Nat Comm 6:8207, 2015). Our results revealed that 32 transcripts, including seven previously incompletely annotated PRD like homeodomain transcription factor genes, were the first to be transcribed at 4 cell stage (day 2 after fertilization), fol lowed by 129 transcripts at 8 cell stage (day 3). The total content of mRNA remained essentially unchanged in oocytes and zygotes, but was reduced 16 fold in 4 cell blastomeres, consistent with the cell division effect and oocyte transcript degradation. Supporting degradation, at 4 cell stage the majority of transcript reads mapped elsewhere than the 5Ã¢ÂÂ promoter and upstream regions of genes.

Gene therapy may constitute a good alternative for the treatment of Fanconi anemia (FA) patients lacking a HLA matched donor. However, in contrast to other disorders already treated by gene therapy, marked prolife ration and differentiation defects have been observed in FA hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), complicating the harvesting of a high number of CD34+ cells to be used in gene therapy protocols. On the other hand, the prolifera tion advantage of gene corrected FA HSCs may facilitate the hematopoietic reconstitution of the patient by a low number of transduced HSCs.

24941,"Classic spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a progressive motor neuron disor der, is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disease of infancy, with an incidence of approximately 1:10,000 and carrier frequency of 1:40 to 1:60. SMA is a monogenic disorder due to homozygous deletion or muta tion in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene at 5q13. An inverted duplication of a nearly homologous Ã¢ÂÂbackupÃ¢ÂÂ gene, SMN2 , is present only in humans. SMN2 differs functionally from SMN1 due to a c.840C>T substituti on which creates an exon splice inhibitor and results in alternative splicing that largely excludes exon 7 and generates a non functional SMN protein. Approximately 10% of transcripts, however, are full length and translate a normal protein. In effect, SMN2 incompletely rescues an otherwise lethal condition. The number of copies of SMN2 is inversely related to the severity of the phenotype. There is a broad range in phenotype. Over half of affected patients have the most severe form, type I, which presents in early infancy. These infants fail to sit or gain motor skills and generally die by 2 years of age, due to related respiratory muscle weakness and pulmonary infection. The less severe forms present as: type II, in later infancy with sitting achie ved, and type III, in childhood with walking achieved. Multiple treatment strategies for spinal muscular atrophy have entered cli nical trials in recent years. Pre clinical cell based and animal model studies have identified several approaches to rescue the phenotype and possibly intervene pre symptomatically. Initial drug trials in SMA examined repur posed use of existing drugs: HDAC inhibitors to increase gene transcription (valproic acid, phenylbutyrate), modulators of exon 7 inclusion in the SMN2 gene (valproic acid, hydroxyurea, quinazolones), and inhibitors of excitoto xicity (glutaminergic: riluzole; GABAergic: gabapentin) or muscle mitochon drial enhancement (l carnitine). None of these demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit. Current drug development for SMA focuses on three strategies: (1) splice site modulation to promote inclusion of exon 7 in the SMN2 transcript via: (a) intrathecal delivery of anti sense oligonucleotides (ASO), Ã¢ÂÂnusinersenÃ¢ÂÂ (Ionis/Biogen) or (b) small molecule oral drugs, Ã¢ÂÂLMI070Ã¢ÂÂ (Novartis) and Ã¢ÂÂRG7916Ã¢ÂÂ (Roche); (2) intravenous gene transfer therapy using scAAV9 SMN1 (AveXis/Nationwide ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital) and; (3) down stream mo dification via: (a) neuroprotective/mitochondrial enhancement, Ã¢ÂÂolesoxi meÃ¢ÂÂ (Trophos/Roche), or (b) troponin activation in muscle, Ã¢ÂÂCK 2127107Ã¢ÂÂ (Cytokinetics).This talk will focus mainly upon the ASO approach to generate full length transcript in target motor neurons, and will summarize the clinical trials that have demonstrated promising improvement in survival and motor function. A pre symptomatic study is also underway. Summary: Both targeted SMN2 gene editing drugs and AAV vector medi ated SMN1 gene replacement studies are advancing through clinical trials and show promising early safety and efficacy results. Downstream disease modifying drugs, by targeting motor neurons or muscle, may provide ad ditional supplemental benefit. Combined treatment may eventually offer a rational multidimensional approach to optimizing therapeutic benefit.

24942,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a major life shortening genetic disease leading to severe respiratory symptoms caused by mutations in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride/bicarbonate channel expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Absence of functional CFTR from the surface of respiratory cells reduces mucociliary clearance, promoting airways obstruction, chronic infections and ultimately lung failure [1]. To date ~2,000 CFTR mutations were reported [2] but one single mutation F508del occurring in ~85% of CF patients worldwide, is associated with intracellular CFTR protein retention and a severe clinical phenotype. Major clinical advances in treating CF symptoms (with mucolytics, antibio tics, etc) have significantly increased survival beyond the second decade (~25 years in Europe). However, to further increase CF patients life expec tancy, CF needs to be treated beyond its symptoms i.e., through treatments addressing the basic defect associated with each CFTR gene mutation [3,4]. One new drug, potentiator VX 770 (ivacaftor/Kalydeco) has hit the clinical setting but only for ~5% of all CF patients, i.e., those bearing G551D and 8 other mutations causing a similar defect in the channel [5]. More recently, a new drug (Orkambi), which combines corrector VX 809 (lumacaftor) rescuing F508del CFTR to the cell surface with potentiator ivacaftor, went into the clinic, following proven efficacy, albeit modest, in a phase III clinical trial for F508del/ F508del patients [6].As these therapies correcting defective CFTR become available, we should quickly pre assess how other CFTR mutations respond to such new drugs.

24943,"Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are often asymptomatic but predispose to aortic dissections, which are associated with high mortality rates. Thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD) can be subdivided into syndromic (associated with systemic manifestations) and non syndromic forms, alt hough recent clinical observations are blurring this distinction. A positive family history occurs in circa 20% of all TAA individuals. Most commonly, familial TAADs segregate in an autosomal dominant manner, but rare auto somal recessive and X linked families have been described. Non syndromic forms of TAA are strongly associated with mutations in genes encoding for proteins of the vascular smooth muscle contractile apparatus (ACTA2, MYH11) or its modifiers (PRKG1, MYLK, FOXE3). Syndromic presentati ons can be linked to alterations in the extracellular matrix (FBN1, FBLN4, MFAP5, LOX) and the transforming growth factor beta signalling pathway (TGFBR1/2, SMAD2/3, TGFB2/3). Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder in which affected individuals present with ocular, skeletal and cutaneous signs besides aneurysm and dissection. Loeys Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an aneurysmal connective tissue disorder that can be distinguished from MFS by the unique presence of craniofacial, skeletal, cutaneous, and/or vascular manifestations, prominently including hypertelorism, cleft palate or bifid uvula and arterial tortuosity with aneu rysms distant from the aortic root. In addition, aneurysms in individuals with LDS tend to dissect at an earlier age and smaller diameter compared to individuals with MFS. Whereas MFS is caused by mutations in FBN1, coding for an extracellular matrix protein, LDS is caused by loss of function mu tations in genes coding for components of the transforming growth factor beta signalling pathway. Significant clinical overlap exists between the phe notypes caused by mutations in the currently known LDS genes (TGFBR1/2, SMAD2/3, TGFB2/3). Recent work has demonstrated that both MFS and LDS lead to dysregulation of the TGFbeta signalling pathway. The latter has opened interesting avenues for the application of new therapeutic strate gies. Current next generation sequencing based gene panel testing for TAAD individuals yields a molecular diagnosis in up to one third of the patients, suggesting that several genes remain to be discovered.",2016
24944,"Autosomal dominant hypertension with brachydactyly (HTNB) is a salt independent Mendelian syndrome caused by activating mutations in the gene encoding phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A). These mutations increase the protein kinase A (PKA) mediated phosphorylation of PDE3A resulting in enhanced cAMP hydrolytic affinity and accelerated cell proliferation. The phosphorylated vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is dimi nished, and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) is dysregulated, potentially accounting for all phenotypic features. Untreated patients die prematurely of stroke; however, hypertension induced target organ dama ge is otherwise hardly apparent. Large vessel and cardiac function is preser ved in HTNB. The patients have normal platelet function. Cell based studies demonstrated that available PDE3A inhibitors inhibit the mutant isoforms. However, increasing cGMP to indirectly inhibit the enzyme appears to have particular utility. Since our report we have been referred additional families with suspected HTNB. We identified a novel aspartic acid substitution at the same site featured by one of our earlier families (p. G449D). We verified in creased PDE3A phosphorylation at Ser438 with a peptide SPOT assay. Our results shed light on PDE3A activation and could be relevant to the treat ment of hypertension in the general population. EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS E1 Novel genome sequencing technologie",2016
24945,"The human genome is arguably the most well assembled reference assem bly yet many gaps remain and aspects of its structural variation remain poorly understood ten years after its finishing. The discovery and resolution of this variation is critical to understanding disease. I will present our most recent work sequencing human and non human primate genomes using single molecule sequencing (SMS) technology. We have developed methods to detect indel and structural variants from several bases up to 50 kbp. We have closed or extended ~50% of the remaining interstitial gaps in the hu man genome and find that 80% of these carry long polypyrimidine/purine tracts multiple kilobases in length. Comparing the single haplotype to the human reference we resolve >35,000 structural variants and >500,000 in dels at the basepair level with 99.9% sequence accuracy. 92% of insertions and 60% of deletions between 50 5000 bp in length are novel representing large swaths > 15 Mbp of undiscovered genetic variation within human ge nomes. We find that such sequences vary extensively in copy number and affect functional elements in the genome. In addition, the analysis uncovers other categories of complex variation that have been difficult to assess in cluding mobile element insertions (eg. SVA) as well as inversions mapping within more complex and GC rich regions of the genome. Our results sug gest a systematic bias against longer and more complex repetitive DNA that can now be partially resolved. I will discuss the potential of this technology to create accurate de novo assemblies of additional human genomes and non human that more comprehensively capture the full spectrum of human genetic diversity and its importance to our understanding of genetic varia tion and disease.

A tangible effect of our networked world in the genomic and personalized medicine context is the increased sharing of genomic and clinical data between professionals, laboratories, hospitals, organizations, patients, participants, andÃ¢ÂÂincreasinglyÃ¢ÂÂacross national borders. Sharing data facilitates both translational and precision medicine, not to mention re search discovery. As various stakeholders in biomedical research and clini cal practice laudably move towards a data sharing culture, challenges arise. In particular, privacy and data privacy regulation play a large role in defining the proper contours of global data sharing. Data sharing is a social activity, and privacy is fundamentally a social consideration. Like any partnership, there are responsibilities on both sides. A central concern is that genomic (and clinical) data must be collected, used, and shared in ways that respect the fundamental rights and interests of individuals and society, as reflected in national and international laws, and most notably, privacy. Data sharing carries a spectrum of risks, particularly re identification of individuals and related others, and thereby represents a prima facie threat to their privacy. In this presentation, I outline the practices and benefits of genomic data sha ring; the dimensions of privacy and data privacy regulation that challenge data sharing; and the ways in which one organization that I am familiar with, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, is addressing these challenges. E4 Peroxisomal disorders still a need for metabolic assays?",2016
24948,"The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) include the Zelllweger spectrum disorders (ZSD) and Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP1). These disorders are due to defects in anyone of 14 PEX genes, whose protein products, or peroxins, are required for the assembly of func tional peroxisomes, which includes the process of matrix enzyme import, new peroxisome membrane formation and division of existing peroxisomes. Defects in 13 genes result in a ZSD phenotype due to the common end effect of reduced peroxisome enzyme functions and correlates best to the B oxi dation defects and accumulation of toxic products. In contrast, the distinct RCDP phenotype is due to a single pathway deficit in the synthesis of spe cialized membrane lipids, plasmalogens. In this lecture we will review per oxisome clinical, biochemical and molecular pathways, their relation to ZSD and RCDP phenotypes, new information on these disorders, single enzyme defects of peroxisome function that relate to PBD and rational management approaches. We will emphasize how scientists, physicians and families have worked together in a rare disease, to push the field forward.",2016
24949,"Peroxisomes are dynamic organelles, which, in humans, play an essential role in a variety of cellular catabolic and anabolic metabolic pathways, in cluding fatty acid alpha and beta oxidation, and plasmalogen and bile acid synthesis. Defects in genes encoding peroxisomal proteins can result in a large variety of peroxisomal disorders affecting either specific metabolic pathways, i.e. the single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies, or causing a ge neralized defect in function, assembly and maintenance of peroxisomes, i.e. peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Clinically, patients with peroxisomal dis orders may present with variable severity ranging from early lethality to subtle neurosensory aberrations. Up till recently, laboratory diagnosis of peroxisomal disorders primarily relied on metabolite analysis followed by biochemical testing and esta blishment of the underlying gene defect. The increasing implementation of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology as first choice of diagnostic evaluation is chancing the diagnostic landscape. While this approach should readily identify genetic defects in classical peroxisomal disorders, it may re sult in the identification of genetic variants with unknown consequences for peroxisomal functioning and short or long term pathogenicity in variant disorders or in patients with mild disease. Insight into the possible of such DNA variants on metabolism and, as an extension thereof, on the individu al requires a multidisciplinary approach combining genetic, biochemical and molecular biological studies. I will briefly review clinical, biochemical and genetic aspects of the different human peroxisomal disorders known to date, with emphasis on some recently discovered defects and including examples of cases where functional assays have been imparitive in the final diagnosis. E5 Ciliopathie",2016
24950,"The primary cilium is a solitary organelle protruding from the surface of almost all vertebrate cell types. Long considered a vestigial remnant, this organelle has recently become the focus of intensive research, that demon strated its many roles in sensing the extracellular environment, and in coor dinating key signaling pathways. In particular, during the embryonic deve lopment, the primary cilium is known to critically regulate main pathways such as Sonic Hedgehog, Wnt and planar cell polarity, that are implicated in left right axis formation, limb development and neurogenesis. Thus, it is not surprising that mutations in genes encoding ciliary proteins underlie a wide spectrum of Ã¢ÂÂciliopathiesÃ¢ÂÂ, that are characterized by substantial overlap among distinct conditions. Indeed, ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome (JS), Meckel syndrome (MKS), Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS), Senior Loken syndrome (SLS), some oral facial digital syndromes (OFD), Jeune asphyxia ting thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and other short rib polydactylies, may va riably share features such as retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis or cystic dysplastic kidneys, congenital liver fibrosis, polydactyly and other skeletal abnormalities, situs inversus, occipital encephalocele and midline oral and facial defects. Clinical heterogeneity is mirrored by genetic heterogeneity, with each ciliopathy being caused by mutations in several genes and, on the other hand, mutations in one gene causing a wide phenotypic spectrum, often encompassing different syndromes of variable severity. For instance, JS and the lethal MKS ciliopathy are allelic at 9 loci. Similarly, mutations in three genes (CSPP1, KIAA0586 and CEP120) cause a spectrum of pheno types with overlapping features of JS, MKS, JATD and OFD. The mechanism through which mutations in the same gene may cause such wide phenotypic variability remains unexplained, with genotype phenotype correlates only partly explaining this variability. The identification of genetic modifiers and other factors able to influence the penetrance and expression of ciliary mutations, represents one of the biggest challenges of current research on ciliopathies. E6 Cost effectiveness in genetic testing",2016
24951,"The existence of finite healthcare budgets and the scarcity of healthcare re sources mean that there is an opportunity cost for every decision made to introduce a new healthcare package, medicine, surgical procedure or dia gnostic test into clinical practice. The decision to allocate resources to a par ticular healthcare intervention excludes those resources from alternative possible uses within a healthcare system. Therefore, ideally, robust evidence is required to inform decision makers allocating healthcare resources about the potential costs and benefits of incorporating a healthcare intervention within clinical practice. Cost effectiveness analysis offers a potential frame work to evaluate the relative costs and benefits of healthcare interventions compared with current practice. Performing cost effectiveness analysis of diagnostics for rare diseases may be problematic for many reasons. The aim of this presentation is to describe the key challenges (methodologi cal, practical, technical and organisational) when conducting robust cost effectiveness analysis of diagnostic tests for rare diseases. The presentati on will begin by presenting an overview of methods of cost effectiveness analysis and explain how they are used by decision making bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

In this presentation I will discuss the analysis of sequence data from 7,855 clinical cardiomyopathy cases and 60,706 ExAC reference samples that we used to better understand genetic variation in cardiomyopathy that causes heart failure and sudden death. The analyses show that in some genes previously reported as important causes of a gi ven cardiomyopathy, rare variation is not clinically informative whereas, in other genes, diagnostic laboratories appear overly conservative when asses sing variant pathogenicity. The impact of cardiomyopathy research studies in the era of comprehensive sequencing is also discussed.

24953,"With the plummeting cost of sequencing, genetic data is becoming increa singly available for use in the diagnosis, treatment and prediction of disease. However, robust and accurate use of genomics in the practice of medicine requires high quality knowledgebases and the accurate interpretation of DNA variation. To address these needs, several efforts have been launched. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), in colla boration with the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), has published a guideline to enable a more systematic assessment of evidence for and against pathogenicity of DNA variants for Mendelian, or monogenic, disease. This includes recommendation for the use of standard terms: Ã¢ÂÂpathogenicÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂlikely pathogenicÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂuncertain significanceÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂlikely benignÃ¢ÂÂ, and Ã¢ÂÂbenignÃ¢ÂÂ to de scribe variants related to monogenic diseases. Variants are classified into these five categories based on combinations of criteria of varying strength (e.g. supporting, moderate, strong, very strong) and type (e.g. population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data, etc.) These gui delines have now been tested by the NIH Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research Consortium and implemented by many clinical laboratories and commercial platforms. In addition, clinical laboratories and expert working groups operating within the NIH funded Clinical Genome Resource Program (ClinGen) are applying the ACMG/AMP guidelines to resolve differences in variant interpretation identified in the NCBIÃ¢ÂÂs ClinVar database and build more granularity into the criteria using gene and disease specific parame ters to enable expert review of variants in ClinVar. As of Apr. 2016, over 500 laboratories had submitted over 125,000 unique interpreted variants to ClinVar. Prior analyses in May 2015 showed that ~11% of variants had interpretations submitted by more than one laboratory, and of those ~17% were interpreted differently. Through pilot efforts the majority of these dif ferences in variant interpretation appear to be resolvable and efforts are underway to resolve these differences using the ACMG/AMP guidelines.

The in troduction in a diagnostic setting raised novel ethical questions. Here we present the principles guiding embryo selection and prioritization that are applied at our center according to the chromosomal content and mutatio nal load of the embryos. Our embryo selection principles are based not only on technical and biological, but also on ethical criteria and have a profound impact on the organization of PGD operations and on the information that is transferred amongst the genetic unit, the fertility clinic and the patients. Those principles are also important for the organization of pre and post counselling and influence the way of interpreting and reporting preimplan tation genotyping results. From June 2014 until November 2015, 314 embryos from 50 couples have been tested in 82 cycles, leading to 16 clinical pregnancies (36% clinical pregnancy rate per cycle for which embryo transfer has been finalized) and the birth of 5 healthy babies, so far. Thirty one different indications, i.e. 27 for monogenic disorders, 3 chromosomal aberrations and 1 case of combi ned monogenic disorder with chromosomal aberration have been included.

24955,"Introduction: Classification of mosaic embryos as aneuploid embryos is a controversial topic, since the association between mosaicism in trophoecto derm cells and inner mass cells is unknown. Moreover, it seems that there is a mechanism by which mosaicism could be corrected. To clarify this issue the outcomes of transfer cycles with mosaic and euploid blastocysts were compared. Material and Methods: We retrospectively reanalyzed array CGH results from trophoectoderm biopsies of 816 blastocysts. We considered a mosaic embryo when the percentage of mosaicism, calculated by the log2 ratio, was higher than 25%. Array CGH analysis was performed using Agilent Sure Print G3 8x60K CGH microarrays with previous whole genome amplifica tion of genomic DNA. The main outcome measures were implantation rate, pregnancy rate and biochemical and clinical miscarriage rate. Results: We detected chromosomal mosaicism in 107 blastocysts (13.1%). Moreover, 49.4% of the analysed embryos were euploid, 30.9% aneuploid ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

The out comes of the cycles were compared between cycles where only mosaic em bryos were transferred and cycles where euploid embryos were transferred. Significant differences were observed in the clinical pregnancy rate (20.6% in mosaic group vs 38.9% in euploid group; p,0.042). Conclusions: Our data show that the transfer of mosaic embryos affects the outcomes of the IVF cycles. Even so, the mosaic embryos have a relatively good IVF success rate and therefore they should not be discarded in couples that donÃÂ´t have euploid embryos for transfer.",2016
24956,"Mosaicism impacts on the recurrence risk. In sporadic cases, a post zygotic event signifies a somatic mosaicism in the affected child and thus parents and siblings are freed from follow up. On the other hand, a pre zygotic mu tation transmitted by an unaffected mosaic parent implies recurrence risk in future offspring and thus prenatal diagnosis options might be discussed. To better estimate the contribution of pre and post zygotic events, we used sporadic retinoblastoma as a model because 80% of Rb cases are due to de novo mutations. We analysed 124 consecutive bilateral retinoblastoma probands carrying a heterozygous RB1 mutation previously ascertained by Sanger sequen cing and their unaffected, non carrier parents. In order to evaluate soma tic mosaicism in blood, the deleterious mutation identified in the proband was searched for in the trios using targeted deep sequencing. Observed recurrences, which should represent an estimate of germline and somatic mosaicism, were recorded for the 124 sibships. Deep sequencing evidenced one mosaic unaffected parent out of 124 tested couples, i.e a 0.8 % risk of mosaicism and thus a theoretical 0.4% risk of recurrence. Follow up in the sibships showed one recurrence out of 199 no vel births, i.e. an observed 0.5 % recurrence risk. Similar estimates were obtained by two independent methods, which is convincing. Consequently a mean 0.5% risk could be used or, more cautiously, a maximum recurrence risk of 2 out of 124 i.e. 1.6%. We believe these results could be considered for genetic counseling in other diseases with a high de novo mutation rate.",2016
24957,"Introduction: Chimaerism and mixoploidy are defined by the presence of cell lineages with different parental genomes or different ploidy states in a single individual, respectively. However, our knowledge on their mecha nistic origin is limited, as it results from indirect observations, often when the cell lineages have been subject to rigorous selective pressure during de velopment. Materials and Methods: We applied haplarithmisis on SNP genotype data to infer the haplotypes and the copy number of parental genomes in 116 single blastomeres comprising entire in vitro produced preimplantation bovine embryos (n,23). Haplarithmisis uncovers copy number aberrations and determines their mechanistic/segregational origin at the single cell level in unprecedented detail, enabling reliable reconstruction of the each embryoÃ¢ÂÂs cleavage history back to the zygote stage. Results: We demonstrate that chromosome instability is comparable bet ween bovine and human cleavage embryos. We further uncover a novel form of genomic instability whereby zygotes spontaneously segregate entire pa rental genomes into different cell lineages during the first post zygotic clea vage division. Importantly, we observed that parental genome segregation was not exclusively triggered by abnormal dispermic fertilization, but also normally fertilized zygotes can spontaneously segregate entire parental ge nomes into distinct cell lineages during cleavage of the zygote. Preliminary data show the mechanism to be conserved in humans as well. Conclusions: We discover a novel mechanism of aberrant cell division in the zygote culminating with the segregation of the parental genomes into distinct cell lineages. We coin this Ã¢ÂÂHeterogoneicÃ¢ÂÂ cell division. This mecha nism is likely the main cause for chimaerism and mixoploidy in mammals.",2016
24958,"Introduction: Approximately 15% of the couples are infertile worldwide. Impaired fertility of male partner is causative in approximately 50% of in fertile couples. Earlier studies from our lab have shown that about 8.5% infertility among Indian men is due to the Y chromosome microdeletions. Further, autosomal and mitochondrial mutations accounted for 20.5% of the genetic factors responsible for infertility among Indian men. However, etiology of large proportion (71%) of infertile men still remained unknown. Therefore, we performed exome sequencing to identify novel genes respon sible for male infertility. Materials and methods: we sequenced exome of 44 idiopathic infertile men using Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform with 100X coverage. Using various bio informatics tools, we have identified 32 novel and rare variants and they were further genotyped in 1000 cases and controls. Of the novel genes iden tified, CETN1 was found to be a strong candidate; hence we have sequenced complete CETN1 in 875 infertile and 552 ethnically matched fertile men. Identified variants were characterized using biophysical and cell biology approaches. Results: We have identified a total of 32 novel, stop gain and missen se variants from 30 genes. Sequencing of CETN1 revealed that one 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR (rs367716858) and a missense (rs61734344) variant are associated with male infertility. Functional studies have shown that rs61734344 (p.

24959,"Identifying causes of intellectual disability remains a considerable medical challenge. Here, we report on six patients from three unrelated consan guineous Algerian, Syrian and Saudi Arabian families presenting with a core phenotype of moderate to severe intellectual disability, speech delay and seizures. High throughput sequencing identified three distinct homozygous mutations in the FRRS1l gene: a missense variant (p. Lys155Glu), a one base pair deletion (p. Val195Glufs*35) and a nonsense mutation (p. Gln321*).FRRS1l encodes a previously uncharacterized peripheral constituent of the AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs). AMPARs are key elements of the mammalian brain responsible for a variety of processes including fast exci tatory neurotransmission, postsynaptic plasticity, or synapse development. These macromolecular complexes assemble from more than 30 different constituents. The inner core determines the biophysical properties of the receptors while the periphery is involved in various aspects of synapse phy siology. To further characterize the physiological role of FRRS1L upon brain deve lopment and function, we used reverse proteomics, biochemical, morpho logical and functional analyses to identify and characterize FRRS1L contai ning AMPARs assemblies. We demonstrated that AMPAR complexes containing FRRS1l are restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum and lack the inner core constituents of AM PARs at the plasma membrane. Virus directed deletion and overexpression of FRRS1l in adult rats alters the number of AMPARs in individual synapses resulting in markedly reduced or increased amplitudes of the EPSCs without effects on their time coursesOur data identify FRRS1L as a new neurodevelopmental disease gene and highlight the key role of this gene in the priming step of AMPAR biogenesis and fast excitatory synaptic transmission.",2016

24961," Early onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEE) represent a heterogeneous group of severe disorders characterized by severe seizures, interictal epi leptiform activity on a disorganized EEG background, developmental re gression or retardation, and onset before one year of age. Among a cohort of 50 patients with EE, we ascertained two unrelated patients with EOEE associated with severe developmental impairment and autosomal recessive variants (namely missense changes and splice site variants) of AP3B2 by means of whole exome sequencing. The targeted sequencing of AP3B2 in 86 additional unrelated individuals with EOEE led to the identification of an additional family with two affected children carrying a homozygous 4 bp deletion leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon. Two additional families with four affected individuals were gathered through the Matchma ker Exchange initiative by matching on autosomal recessive mutations of AP3B2. This report presents eight individuals from five unrelated families presenting with global hypotonia, an EOEE with stagnation or regression of psychomotor acquisitions with absent speech. Eye contact was poor and associated with an optic atrophy when assessed (5/5). Patients presented with a post natal microcephaly (7/8) and brain MRI identified a superior cerebellar vermis atrophy. AP3B2 encodes for a neuron specific subunit of the AP 3B complex, which is involved in synaptic vesicles biogenesis and transport. Conversely, a natural ap3b2 knockout mouse strain was reported with neurodevelopmental disorders including tonic clonic seizures. To con clude, these genetic evidences support the implication of autosomal recessi ve mutations of AP3B2 in EOEE with optic atrophy.",2016
24962,"One of the pathways known to regulate cell growth is the mTOR pathway through the MTORC1 and MTORC2 complex. Somatic mutations in genes within the mTOR pathway are a well known cause of hemimegalencephaly in humans by upregulating mTOR activity. Subsequently, germline mutati ons in mTOR pathway genes might also affect brain size. Here, we report germline de novo missense mutations in the mTOR activators RHEB (2 fami lies, 3 patients) and RAC1 (2 families, 2 patients). Mutations in both mTOR pathway genes cause an intellectual disability (ID) syndrome with aberrant head and brain size. Whereas patients with RHEB mutations show severe ID with hypotonia, epilepsy and macrocephaly, microcephaly was observed in patients with RAC1 mutations. Concordant with the human phenotype, we found that overexpression of mutant rheb in zebrafish embryos results in megalencephaly and increased neural proliferation, while overexpression of mutant rac1 causes microcephaly, decreased neuronal proliferation and cerebellar defects. Intrauterine transfer of mutant Rheb into the brain of embryonic mice disrupted neuronal migration and caused epilepsy. Neuro cognitive phenotypes observed in zebrafish carrying mutant RHEB peptides could be ameliorated through pharmacological treatment with the mTOR pathway antagonist rapamycin, providing clues for potential future thera peutic targets in patients with activating de novo RHEB mutations. Based on our genetic and functional data de novo germline mutations of mTOR pathway regulator genes RHEB and RAC1 cause ID with opposite alterations in head and brain size, which reflect the functional effect of these mutations during vertebrate development.",2016
24963,"PPM1D (Protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1D), or Wip1 , is a type 2C phosphatase that regulates stress response pathways including the DNA Damage Response, through inhibiting p53 and other tumour suppres sors. Mosaic mutations in non tumour cell lineages in the last exon (exon 6) of PPM1D have been found in patients with breast and ovarian cancer. These truncating mutations, which might have been chemotherapy induced, reta ined the phosphatase catalytic domain, leading to a gain of function effect. We diagnosed 4 children (2 14 years) with mild moderate intellectual disa bility (ID) who had de novo germline frameshift, nonsense or splice site mutations in exon 5 of PPM1D . Various behavioral and neurological pro blems were noted, such as ADHD, ODD, anxiety disorder, neonatal feeding problems, hypotonia, gait problems and a high pain threshold. Shared facial dysmorphisms show a broad forehead, lateral hypoplasia of eyebrows, long palpebral fissures, upturned nose, short philtrum and broad mouth. In fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from three patients, we tested p53 activation in response to ionizing radiation (IR) exposure. All three cell lines showed normal to increased p53 activation compared to controls, in contrast to the suppression of IR induced p53 activation pre viously seen in HeLa cells and U2OS cells transfected with cancer associated truncated PPM1D cDNA alleles with exon 6 mutations. In conclusion, we show that de novo germline mutations in exon 5 of PPM1D cause syndromic ID. Notably, these mutations do not appear to cause gain of function effects on p53 as has been shown for exon 6 mutations in breast and ovarian cancer patients. C03 Mutational Mechanism",2016

Here we applied high resolution ar ray CGH to 300 patients with congenital limb malformations. We found 31 pathogenic CNVs in known disease loci and identified 6 new loci previously not known to be associated with limb malformations. The pathogenic CNVs affected non coding cis regulatory elements more frequently than expected (21 non coding vs 16 coding). We performed functional studies in transge nic mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and/or segregation studies in these families to investigate the pathogenicity of 6 novel CNVs causing limb de fects. Overall we reached a diagnostic yield of 12%, which is comparable to copy number studies in other cohorts such as intellectual disability. Howe ver, the majority of the pathogenic CNVs (57%) were likely to result from changes in the non coding cis regulatory landscape, while only 43% were due to gene dosage effects or haploinsufficinency. Additionally, we identi fied 20 rare CNVs of unknown clinical significance (7%) that were inherited ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 20Back to index from an unaffected parent. Due to reduced penetrance, a key feature of limb malformations, these rare CNVs might still have an important impact on the skeletal phenotypes of our patients. Our results suggest that CNVs affecting non coding regulatory elements are a major cause of congenital limb malformations.",2016
24965,"Introduction: Most apparently balanced translocations are thought to result mechanistically from non homologous end joining (NHEJ) or, in rare cases of recurrent events, by nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Ho wever, few events have been studied with breakpoint resolution. Materials and Methods: Here, we use low coverage mate pair whole genome sequencing to identify and fine map rearrangement breakpoint junctions in individuals with previously detected germ line translocations. In total, 46 junctions from 22 carriers of balanced translocations including both phe notypically normal individuals (n,8) and affected individuals (n,14) were characterized. Results: Genes were disrupted in 48% of the breakpoints; recessive genes in 50% of the normal carriers (inferring a risk of mendelian disease in the offspring) and known dominant intellectual disability genes in 21% of the affected carriers. Finally, seven disrupted candidate disease genes involved in various cellular functions and pathways were identified. Microhomology (2 to 6 bp) was observed in 69% of translocation events. Surprisingly, small insertions (5 to 12 bp), originating from local genomic sequences, were ob served in 23%.Conclusions: Microhomology associated with templated insertions is a cha racteristic of breakpoint junctions for rearrangements mediated by the er ror prone replication based repair mechanisms (RBMs). Our data therefore indicate, that even though NHEJ likely underlie many of the balanced trans locations reported here, RBMs contribute to the formation of at least 20% of the cases. The involvement of RBM in these rearrangements supports the contention that a significant portion of so called germ line translocations may have a mitotic origin.",2016
24966,"Introduction: Chromoanagenesis is the process by which a single catastro phic event creates complex rearrangements confined to a single or a few chromosomes. It is usually characterized by the presence of multiple de letions and/or duplications, as well as by copy neutral rearrangements. In contrast, an array CGH screen of patients with developmental anomalies revealed three patients in which a single chromosome carries from 8 to 11 large copy number gains confined to a single chromosome, but the absence of deletions. Surprised by this finding, we set out to further characterize the se derivative chromosomes. Materials and Methods: Chromosome structure was evaluated using fluo rescence in situ hybiridization (FISH), Illumina massive parallel sequencing, and PacBio single molecule sequencing. Breakpoints were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Results: FISH and Illumina/PacBio sequencing revealed derivative chro mosomes maintain their original order, with inserted duplicons clustered together in distinct locations. Breakpoint junction sequences showed both microhomology and non templated insertions of up to 40 bp. Conclusions: Here we present three patients with a single altered chromo some composed of clustered insertional duplications, no deletions, and bre akpoint junction sequences showing microhomology and/or non templated insertions. These observations are difficult to reconcile with current mecha nistic descriptions of chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis. Therefore, we hypothesize those rearrangements to be of a mechanistically different origin. In addition, we suggest that large untemplated insertional sequences observed at breakpoints are driven by a non canonical non homologous end joining mechanism.

24967,"Gradual accumulation of mutations in human adult stem cells during life is associated with various age related diseases, including cancer. The number of stem cell divisions throughout life is believed to be a major determinant for mutation accumulation and could explain the extreme variation of can cer incidence across different organs. Yet, mutation patterns and rates of healthy adult stem cells remain unknown. Here, we determined genome wide mutation patterns in primary adult stem cells of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ran ging from 3 to 87 years. We find that the number of mutations increases linearly with age up to se veral thousand mutations per cell at 87 years of age, while mutation spectra remain constant throughout life. Small intestine and colon stem cells have a 2 fold higher mutation rate per year compared with liver stem cells. These differences could be exclusively attributed to the mutagenic action of spon taneous deamination of cytosine residues and may reflect the high stem cell division rate in these tissues. The genomic distribution of somatic mutations is non random and predo minantly associated with DNA replication dynamics in the small intestine and colon, and with transcription in the liver. These results indicate that a stable balance, between various mutagenic and DNA repair processes, is maintained throughout life and that the activity of these processes in adult stem cells varies between tissues.

24968,"Mutations affecting splicing are a significant contributor to human disease. Classification of splicing variants is often binary, with only those that fall within the canonical splice site (CSS) assumed to affect splicing, and to be akin to other protein truncating variants (PTVs). We performed both popu lation genetic and disease burden analyses to better understand the distri bution of splice disrupting variants in and around the CSS using 4,294 exo me sequenced trios from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study. We also used these data to compare the performance of several spli cing prediction tools. We observed that a subset of positions outside the CSS (including the 5th base after the intron/exon boundary at the donor end, and the last base of the exon) exhibited evidence of both high levels of purifying selection, and excess de novo mutations in patients. Additionally, within the two bases of canonical donor sites we observed strong evidence of discordant impact on splicing, with the base proximal to the exon showing significantly higher de novo enrichment and singleton ratio. We observed high concordance of the splicing prediction tools with our observations, however they failed to cap ture completely the landscape of splice disrupting variation. Taken together, these data suggest binary classification of variants as Ã¢ÂÂspli cingÃ¢ÂÂ only if they are in the CSS is oversimplified, and that this has a sub stantial impact on both the sensitivity and specificity of identifying genuine PTVs.

We hypothe size that the proteome wide turnover analysis is crucial to understand the functional impact of T21.Materials and Methods: We investigated the effect of the extra chr21 at the levels of transcript quantity, proteome quantity and protein turnover rate. We analyzed the primary fetal skin fibroblasts derived from a pair of mono zygotic twins discordant for T21, which uniquely allowed us to characterize the proteome changes due to T21 without the noise of genomic variability. To validate, we also analyzed the fibroblasts from 11 unrelated T21 indivi duals and 11 controls. We applied the cutting edge SWATH mass spectrome try to reproducibly measure the proteomes. Results: We quantified 4056 unique proteins for expression and ~2200 pro teins by pulsed SILAC experiment for turnover analysis in both normal and T21 fibroblasts from the twins. The proteome wide T21/normal fold change correlation was extremely low, indicating substantial post transcriptional regulation and buffering effects in T21. Overall, the protein degradation was faster in trisomy cells than the controls. Remarkably, those Chr21 encoded proteins that are members of heteromeric protein complexes in particular seemed to be exempt from responding to copy number alternations, like ly through accelerated protein degradation. Moreover, we found that both mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomal proteomes were degraded heavily in T21, but different degree of translational regulation shaped their final, divergent expression levels. Conclusion: Prevalent, organelle specific proteome remodeling was identi fied as the proteomic hallmark of T21 as compared to normal. C04 Complex Trait",2016

For the genetic association study, we considered a total of 173,480 individuals with phenotype and genotype data passing stringent quality control filters at 29.5 million genetic variants (MAF > 0.01%). Effect size estimates and their standard errors were combined across the three studies using inverse variance weighted meta analyses. Overall, 182,105 variants were declared to be associated with at least one blood cell trait, represented here by a set of 1,652 distinct sentinel variants. Of these 148 corresponded to previously reported GWAS hits thereby va lidating almost all the blood trait associations previously reported in Eu ropean samples. Associations with the remaining 1,504 variants are novel, augmenting the number of known associations by over 10 fold.

24971,"Introduction: The genetic basis of human immune responses to pathogens has a profound effect on susceptibility to human infectious and immune mediated diseases. A highly diverse set of immune cells is involved in produ cing cytokines to regulate these immune responses. However, the impact of genetic variation on the production of these regulatory cytokines during the course of infection is unknown. Materials and methods: In this study we profiled genome wide SNP geno types, FACS assessment of the cell populations as well as cytokine respon ses to major human pathogens (bacteria, virus and fungus) in whole blood, PBMCs, macrophages and T cells of 500 healthy individuals. We performed a systematic study to reveal organization of cytokine responses to different pathogens in different cell types. We then correlated the cytokine levels to SNPs and performed integrative genomics analysis to identify genes that control cytokine production in different immune cells. Results and conclusions: We have identified 15 novel loci significantly asso ciated (P<5x10 8) with different cytokine levels in response to pathogens. We show that the cytokine QTLs are under positive selection and are en riched to be associated with human diseases. Furthermore, SNPs affecting monocyte derived cytokines are enriched to be associated with infectious diseases, whereas SNPs that affect T cell derived cytokines are associated with autoimmune diseases. We show that the genetic variability in the im mune pathways is organized around a physiological response to specific pa thogens. In summary, we show that upon stimulation genetic variation plays a significant role in influencing human immune responses and diseases.",2016

In this study we explore the immune cell landscape for factors that influence cell abun dance. We measured over 210 different absolute cell levels and cell per centages from B, NK and T cells subpopulations from fresh blood samples of 500 healthy Dutch individuals. We observed a consistent gender effect, where females have higher cell levels, an overall negative correlation with age and a considerable fluctuation with respect to season. In addition, we assessed the influence of hormones and circulating antibodies in the im mune system and found no significant effect of these on cell variation. Next, we profiled the genotype of the 500 volunteers and searched for genetic associations to the absolute cell levels and proportions, these traits were controlled for gender, age effect and date of collection to evaluate for cell count QTLs (ccQTL) on ~7 million variants. We identified 11 independent loci associated with at least one cell type. Of these, 5 previously reported loci were replicated. Additionally, we performed an integrative genomics analysis to identify genes implicated to the variation of the cell levels, using RNA seq data from blood of ~600 samples from an independent Dutch co hort, we performed cis eQTL mapping and prioritized candidate genes for the novel loci. Furthermore, we detected that ccQTLs are enriched for SNPs associated with immune related diseases.

24973,"Introduction: The majority of complex disease associations are with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in non coding enhancer regions, which may regulate transcription through long range interactions with their target genes. The 6q23 locus, associated with several autoimmune diseases including RA, contains many intergenic SNPs situated a large di stance from any gene. The aim of this work was to identify causal disease genes at the locus by studying long range chromatin interactions in human T and B cell lines. Materials and Methods: Capture Hi C (CHi C) targeting both the disease intergenic region and all promoters within 500kb of associated SNPs was used to investigate potential interactions between RA associated variants and their functional targets. Targeted 3C qPCR analysis in B cell lines con taining the appropriate SNP genotype was used to study genotype specific interactions. Results: CHi C identified numerous looping interactions between restriction fragments containing intergenic SNPs and the IL20RA gene, upstream of IF NGR1 and lncRNAs downstream of TNFAIP3 . IL20RA and TNFAIP3 interac ted with the same lncRNAs, and with each other. 3C qPCR showed that the risk allele of the most likely causal SNP , rs6927172, was correlated with a higher frequency of interactions with IL20RA . The risk allele was also asso ciated with increased expression of IL20RA mRNA, and increased binding of enhancer histone marks and transcription factors in T cells. Conclusions: Complex looping interactions within the 6q23 region bring RA associated SNPs, genes and regulatory elements together. This work shows that GWAS associated SNPs cannot simply be assigned to the nearest gene, potentially identifying novel targets for new therapies.",2016

24976,"Introduction: Familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and its precursor, C cell hyperplasia (CCH), is associated with germline RET mutations causing multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. However, some rare families with ap parent MTC/CCH predisposition do not have a detectable RET mutation. Materials and Methods: To identify novel MTC/CCH predisposition genes we undertook exome resequencing studies in a family with apparent predispo sition to MTC/CCH and no identifiable RET mutation. Results: We identified a novel ESR2 frameshift mutation, c.948delT , which segregated with histological diagnosis following thyroid surgery in family members and demonstrated loss of ESR2 encoded ERÃÂ² expression in the MTC tumour. ERÃÂ± and ERÃÂ² form heterodimers binding DNA at specific estro gen response elements (ERE) to regulate gene transcription. ERÃÂ² represses ERÃÂ± mediated activation of the ERE and the RET promoter contains three ERE. In vitro, we showed that ESR2 c.948delT results in unopposed ERÃÂ± me diated increased cellular proliferation, activation of the ERE and increased RET expression. In vivo, immunostaining of CCH and MTC using an anti RET antibody demonstrated increased RET expression.

To assess the value of the components of the InSiGHT classi fication system, and of additional points of evidence not considered in their approach, we have performed a systematic investigation of 24 MSH2 and MLH1 variants identified in a single institution, six of which had not been previously classified. The data used for evaluation included: population fre quency, co segregation, tumor molecular characteristics (including loss of heterozygosity), RNA analyses, and in vitro functional assays. In addition, evaluation of the variants with multiple in silico programs was performed. Overall, previous classifications of 18 variants were confirmed based on no vel lines of evidence, supporting the utility of the InSiGHT approach. Among the in silico programs, PON MMR2 and MAPP MMR had the best overall ac curacy when assessed versus classifications according to InSIGHT criteria. Since one of the major problems associated with InSiGHT classification is the need of independent replication of functional results due to lack of cli nically validated in vitro assays, we propose that concordance of the two programs in predicting deleterious effects might be used as a surrogate for the functional MMR test. In sum, we propose an improved strategy for MMR gene variant interpretation, which can serve as a model for other disease genes.",2016

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder characterized by congenital defects, bone marrow (BM) failure and cancer susceptibility. FA patients require strict follow up including periodic BM testing. We have stu died the prevalence of clonal mosaicism in FA patients and whether it could be an early marker for cancer. Methods. Retrospective blood DNA samples of 129 FA patients (0 50yo) were analyzed by SNP array. Mosaic events were detected with MAD softwa re and experimentally validated by microsatellite and MLPA analyses. Results. We detected and validated 45 mosaic events in 14/129 patients, including 7 uniparental disomies, 15 deletions, 13 duplications, 3 complex rearrangements, 2 monosomies and 5 tri/tetrasomies. We detected 6 gains in 3q in 5 patients where 4 of them developed hematologic cancer and 3 events whose intestitial BP was within HLA loci. Compared to age matched population controls, FA individuals had a 110 250X rate of detectable mo saicism. Cancer was more frequently diagnosed (4X) in cases with detectab le mosaicism during a 0 10 year follow up. Conclusions. In FA, clonal mosaicism prevalence is increased and related to higher cancer risk. 3q gain, typically related to leukemia, is the most com mon rearrangement found in mosaicism in our cohort and in those patients with leukemia. Therefore, mosaicism detection in blood by SNP array could be used as an early marker for cancer in FA.

In 2009, it has been demonstrated a ~3 fold excess of the RB1 maternal canonical transcript due to an imprinting mechanism. As a consequence, maternally inherited hypomorphic mutations may retain suf ficient suppressor activity to prevent tumor development. Here, we change the perspective of retinoblastoma field demonstrating a differential allelic expression of hypomorphic variants that significantly influence the phe notyipic outcome in families at risk for RB onset. In one family, the father who presented with retinoma and the two children who developed retino blastoma were all identified harboring an hypomorphic splicing variant (c.2663+2T>C). RT PCR quantitative analysis showed a higher expression of the abnormally spliced product in the father along with an inversion of the ratio between the two differentially spliced isoforms. A parent of origin effect was demonstrated for another hypomorphic mutation (p. Arg661Trp) able to induce RB in a child of a male carrier with an anamnestic history positive for osteosarcoma. For the first time, here we also identified somatic mosaicism as importanant factor that can impact the phenotypic expres sion. Indeed, segregation analysis performed by high depth NGS assay in another family, showed a ~50% of mutated molecules in the proband with retinoblastoma in comparison with a ~30% in the father with retinoma, ac cordingly with a somatic mosaicism.

This study aimed to explore the impact of APC mutational mosaicism in unexplained polyposis. Methods: To comprehensively screen for somatic low level APC mosaicism, high coverage next generation sequencing of the APC gene was performed using DNA from leukocytes and a total of 53 colorectal tumors from 20 unrelated patients with unexplained sporadic adenomatous poly posis. APC mosaicism was assumed if the same loss of function APC mu tation was present in Ã¢ÂÂ¥ two anatomically separated colorectal adenomas/carcinomas per patient. All mutations were validated using diverse me thods. Results: In 25% (5/20) of patients, somatic mosaicism of a pathoge nic APC mutation was identified as underlying cause of the disease. In 2/5 cases, the mosaic level in leukocyte DNA was slightly below the sensitivity threshold of Sanger sequencing; while in 3/5 cases, the allelic fraction was either very low (0.1 1%) or no mutations were detectable. The majority of mosaic mutations were located outside the somatic Mutation Cluster Regi on of the gene. Conclusions: The present data indicate a high prevalence of pathogenic mosaic APC mutations below the detection thresholds of routine diagnostics in adenomatous polyposis, even if high coverage sequencing of leukocyte DNA alone is taken into account.

Discussion: The aim of avoiding the suffering of prospective parents may be acceptable provided additional criteria are met relating to the wider social context of screening: i) is private access available for other screening opti ons, ii) are services provided equitably following the outcomes of reproduc tive choice, and iii) is screening also offered prior to conception?",2016
24983,"Background: Carrier screening for autosomal recessive disorders aims to enhance reproductive decision making by identifying couples at a 1 in 4 risk in every pregnancy of having an affected child. Except for few countries or regions, carrier screening is not widely offered, and is mostly ancestry based. Technological advances enable carrier screening for multiple di seases simultaneously. This allows universal screening regardless of ance stry (population based expanded carrier screening). It is important to study how this can be successfully implemented, and what can be learned from already existing initiatives. Methods: Factors associated with successful implementation were identi fied by: 1) a literature review, and 2) two case studies; studying experiences with carrier screening in two high risk communities (a Dutch founder po pulation, and the Ashkenazi Jewish population), including a survey among community members. Results: Factors identified were: familiarity with (specific) genetic diseases and (the availability of) testing, high perceived benefits of screening (e.g. screening avoids much suffering), acceptance of reproductive options, per ceived risk of being a carrier, and low perceived social barriers (e.g. stig matization). In contrast to the Jewish community, the initial demand for screening in the Dutch founder population did not entirely come from the community itself. However, the large social cohesion of the community faci litated the implementation process. Conclusion: In order to ensure successful implementation of population based expanded carrier screening, effort should be made to increase know ledge about genetic diseases, create awareness and address personal bene fits of screening in a non directive way.

Advocates of EUCS mention three main moral advantages of this new proposition as compared with traditional (targeted and/or ancestry based) forms of carrier scree ning: EUCS will (1) further enhance the autonomy of prospective parents by providing them with more information relevant for making reproductive choices; (2) provide equal access to carrier testing services; (3) reduce the risk of stigmatisation. Our empirical ethics study aims to widen this account and provide a balanced picture of the potential pros and cons of EUCS. Methods: Semi structured interviews with 17 health (policy) professionals and representatives of patient organisations about their views on carrier screening including a possible EUCS scenario. Results: Stakeholders acknowledged the potential benefits of EUCS, but also expressed five main moral concerns: (1) Does EUCS respond to an ur gent problem or population need? (2) Is it possible to offer couples both understandable and sufficient information about EUCS? (3) How will socie tal views on Ã¢ÂÂreproductive responsibilityÃ¢ÂÂ change as a result of EUCS? (4) Is EUCS the best way to reach high risk populations? (5) Will EUCS reinforce disability based stigmatisation? Conclusions: While having the potential to overcome some moral limits in herent in traditional carrier screening, EUCS comes with moral challenges of its own. More research is needed to (further) anticipate the moral and practical implications of EUCS.",2016
24985,"Introduction: Expanded carrier screening panels analyze dozens or hundreds of recessive disease genes for couples planning to have children, but literature on the clinical utility of screening conditions beyond profes sional guidelines is scarce. We surveyed at risk couples for this purpose. Methods: Patients used an expanded carrier screen for up to 110 genes. At risk couples were those whose partners were also carriers for the same autosomal recessive diseases. We invited 465 consecutive at risk couples to participate in an IRB approved survey. Results: 70 completed the survey; 13 that reported a family history were excluded from analysis. 41 were not pregnant at time of screening. Of tho se that were not pregnant, 63% indicated that they would choose IVF with PGD, prenatal diagnosis, gamete donation, adoption, or no reproduction. 27% indicated that they were not planning to alter reproductive plans. The remainder did not indicate clear plans. Participants who do not plan to pur sue alternative options indicated perceived severity as a major reason. Of pregnant participants, 43% elected fetal diagnosis. Two reported interest in testing, but miscarried before the procedure could be done. Seven did not consider the condition sufficiently severe to consider pregnancy terminati on. Of 7 pregnancies that underwent prenatal diagnosis, 5 were unaffected and 2 were affected. One of the affected pregnancies was terminated and one was continued. Conclusion: Most at risk couples altered reproductive planning, demonstra ting clinical utility of this information. Perceived severity of the condition factored into decision making with milder diseases less likely to change planning.",2016
24986,"NGS technologies have allowed to test the carrier status of a large number of diseases in a cost effective manner and some reproductive centres call for the implementation of an Expanded Carrier Screening (ECS) test in oo cyte donation (OD) programs. One of the main arguments against ECS in reproductive medicine is that its results may turn out to be psychosocially harmful to the donors. Hence, this study aims to assess the emotional and psychological impact of ECS in an OD program. Our studied population consisted of 100 oocyte donors assessed in the fra mework of an OD program at Dexeus WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Health in Barcelona. We eva luated participantÃ¢ÂÂs acquired knowledge, satisfaction with genetic counsel ling, perceived usefulness of ECS, and emotional and psychological impact (anxiety and depression measured by STAI and HADS D scales) at three dif ferent moments: before pre test genetic counselling session, after post test genetic counselling session and after post donation follow up appointment. Although carriersÃ¢ÂÂ donors scored higher in the emotional and psychological impact questionnaires than those who were not carriers, none of the sub jects had HADS D and STAI scores considered pathologic at baseline, imme diate or follow up surveys. No correlation was found between the remaining variables and the psychological impact. Our findings suggest that ECS results in oocyte donors do not seem to have a meaningful emotional and psychological impact and seems to be well to lerated and accepted by our participants. Genetic counselling at different stages of the clinical process is essential in order to achieve the purposes of decreasing anxiety in the gamete donors.

24987,"For severely ill newborns quick molecular diagnoses are of utmost impor tance for clinical decision making and can prevent unnecessary and someti mes invasive diagnostics. To date, immediate molecular testing is not a rou tine procedure for all patients since this is available only for few diseases. Here we present a procedure to analyze 2800 genetic disorders in severely ill newborns and infants by rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS), and completed in approximately 2 weeks. WGS is carried out in parallel to stan dard diagnostic procedures. The final evaluation of the results is done by a multidisciplinary team. Thus far we have included 22 patients in the study and have provided a diagnosis of a monogenic disease for four patients. The se patients presented with different clinical characteristics and that could be explained by mutations in the EIF2B5, EPG5, KLHL41 and RMND1 genes. One patient was diagnosed with a 1p36 microdeletion upon routine diagno stic testing. In 12 patients without a diagnosis we got informed consent from the parents for further analysis in research setting. We prioritized genes using Network analysis based on gene co expression and patient specific Human Pheno type Ontology (HPO) terms. In addition RNA sequencing has been perfor med in a subset of child parent trios to assess whether aberrant expression patterns can help interpreting possible pathogenic variants. This research follow up has led to three potential new diagnoses. Currently we are evaluating the procedure. We will emphasize on pheno type selection, technical aspects of coverage and filtering methods.",2016
24988,"The combination of phenotype and genotype based prioritization strate gies proved to be highly effective for detecting disease causing mutations in high throughput sequencing studies. However, the performance of these approaches also depends on the precision of the clinical description and re quires some expert knowledge. Facial recognition technology, that detects dysmorphic features from two dimensional photographs, holds the pro mise to assist in deep phenotyping of syndromic patients. Therefore, we evaluated the syndrome predictions of image analyses in a cohort of more than 100 patients with a diverse spectrum of confirmed molecular diagno ses of monogenic disorders with the Facial dysmorphology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. Automated facial recognition yields the correct diagno sis amongst the first ten suggested syndromes in more than two thirds of the cases and shows a high correlation with syndrome predictions that were based on expert annotated features. Hereby, we could confirm the diagnosis in cases with only subtle facial features amongst them patients with Roth mund Thomson syndrome, Mowat Wilson syndrome, Ectodermal Dyspla sia, Fragile X syndrome, Rubinstein Taybi syndrome and Mabry syndrome. When exome data of patients was filtered for rare sequence variants and intersected with genes that were associated with the likeliest syndromes according to image analysis, the pathogenic mutations could be identified in all cases with few false positives. Our results show that computer assisted facial recognition is not only a promising technology that could be applied in the routine diagnostic workflow, but also a technology that allows diagnosis in cases with non typical clinical presentation.",2016
24989,"Copy number variation (CNV) is a common source of genomic variation and an important genetic cause of disease. Microarray based CNV analysis has become a first tier diagnostic test for patients with intellectual disability, with a diagnostic yield of 10 20%. However, for most other genetic disor ders the role of CNVs is less clear and genetic studies are generally limited to the study of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and other small variants. With the introduction of exome and genome sequencing it is now possible to detect both SNVs and CNVs in a single test. Here, we have performed exome based CNV screening on data from 2,603 patients affected by a range of 14 different genetic disorders for which exome sequencing was performed in a diagnostic setting. Using read depth analysis we identified 131 clinically relevant CNVs ranging in size from 729bp Ã¢ÂÂ 8.4Mb. This results in 53 conclu sive diagnoses, an overall diagnostic yield of 2%. CNVs were found exerting both dominant and recessive effects, as well as CNVs unmasking a recessive mutation that results in pathogenic compound heterozygous events. This study shows that CNVs play an important role in a broad range of genetic disorders and nicely illustrates how these CNVs can be readily detected from exome sequencing, without the need for additional genetic tests. This brings us closer to single test genomics. Funding: NWO 016.166.015 and ERC DENOVO 281964",2016

We have now further optimized a single molecule molecular inversion probe (smMIP) based targeted re sequencing approach 1. Single molecule tracing is enabled using up to 410 (1,048,576) molecular tags. Consensus calling of respective PCR duplicates allows correction for PCR and sequencing errors. The improved assay allows low frequency or sub clonal variant detection with variant levels of <0.05%. This assay provides very robust genotyping accuracy, high throughput, fast turnaround and cost effectiveness. We anticipate that this or similar assays allow novel applications in which mutations are present in very low relative abundance in any given DNA sample with important new applications bey ond cancer genetics. Here we present first successful applications that include: 1.) Accurate de termination of the fraction of mutated alleles for post zygotic de novo mu tations 2. 2.) Detection of previously unrecognized mosaic disease causing mutations for rare clinical syndromes. 3.) Detection of known Ã¢ÂÂpaternal age effect disordersÃ¢ÂÂ causing mutations as small clonal events in dissected testis material 3. 4.)

24991,"Nucleotide repeat expansions are a major cause of neurological and neuro muscular disease in humans, however, the nature of these genomic regions makes characterizing them extremely challenging. Accurate DNA sequen cing of repeat expansions using short read sequencing technologies is dif ficult, as short read technologies often cannot read through regions of low ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 27Back to index sequence complexity. Additionally, these short reads do not span the entire region of interest and therefore sequence assembly is required. Lastly, most target enrichment methods are reliant upon amplification which adds the additional caveat of PCR bias. We have developed a novel, amplification free enrichment technique that employs the CRISPR/Cas9 system for specific targeting of individual human genes. This method, in conjunction with PacBioÃ¢ÂÂs long reads and uniform coverage, enables sequencing of complex genomic regions that cannot be investigated with other technologies. Using human genomic DNA samples and this strategy, we have successfully targeted the loci of HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs Disease (HTT; CAG repeat), Fragile X (FMR1; CGG repeat), ALS (C9orf72; GGGGCC repeat), and Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10; variable AT TCT repeat) for examination. With this data, we demonstrate the ability to isolate hundreds of individual on target molecules in a single SMRT Cell and accurately sequence through long repeat stretches, regardless of the extre me GC content. The method is compatible with multiplexing of multiple tar gets and multiple samples in a single reaction. This technique also captures native DNA molecules for sequencing, allowing for the possibility of direct detection and characterization of epigenetic signatures.",2016
24992,"The FMR1 contains an unstable CGG repeat in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region. This repeat is expanded from around 30 (normal) to a range of 55 200 re peats in female premutation carriers. Premutations occur in the population with an estimated frequency of about 1 in 200 and are at risk for developing FXTAS and POF. Furthermore, the germline transmission of the repeat is highly unstable, and therefore premutation females will often transmit a full mutation to their offspring. The risk that a premutation female will transmit a full mutation is variab le. The larger CGG repeats expand faster to full mutations. In addition, AGG triplets interrupting the CGG repeat reduce the risk for expansions. Despite its importance, AGG measurement is not yet a standard feature of FMR1 dia gnostic work up. If determined, AGG interruptions are detected by a Triplet Primed PCR. Unfortunately, those AGG interruptions can be obscured becau se the normal and premutated allele camouflage each otherÃ¢ÂÂs interruptions. Here, we explore single molecule sequencing (Pacific Biosciences) to deter mine the AGG interruptions in a cohort of premutation females. We demon strate that single molecule sequencing correctly determines the size of both the normal and premutated allele for each female of the cohort. More intere stingly, the single molecule sequencing also allows the unambiguous sepa ration of the normal from the premutated allele which enables the detection of the location and number of AGG interruptions for each allele. We foresee that this technology will replace current tests and has the potential to im prove risk estimates allowing for improved genetic counseling.

The reanalysis of available Ge nome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data with novel sequencing based reference panels is a promising and cost effective approach to unravel and to better characterize the genetic factors that give susceptibility to tumor related processes. Materials and Methods: We developed GWImp COMPSs, an integrated fra mework that performs imputation and association testing, to re analyze 9 different cancer data, comprising around 80,000 subjects, through imputa tion with UK10K, 1000 Genomes phase 3 and Go NL. To date, we have ana lyzed 9,124 samples for bladder cancer and 11,209 samples for lung cancer. Results: Beyond confirming and fine mapping known loci for these cancers, we identified two novel loci associated with bladder cancer in the ZCCHC7 gene (MAF, 0.01, OR,0.28, p,5.7e 11, regulatory region variant) and in the GRIN2B gene (MAF, 0.01, OR,4.77, p,9.1e 11, intron variant). For lung cancer, a novel associated locus was found near the TECRL gene (MAF,0.01, OR,3.16, p,2.4e 8).Importantly, the ZCCHC7 intragenic variant is highly conserved and, accor ding to ENCODE and TRANSFAC, is a DNase I hypersensitive site with open chromatin histone marks (H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac), and it is predicted to disrupt the transcription factor binding site for several tran scription factors, including the binding of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1. Conclusions: By reanalyzing existing GWAS data with newer sequencing based reference panels, we identified novel low frequency variants asso ciated with cancer risk. These findings, will ultimately allow the develop ment of prognosis, diagnosis and therapeutic protocols.",2016

To ensure that the newly discovered height associated exome chip variants are independent of the 697 known height SNPs the conditional effect sizes derived from the same sample have to be calculated. To this end, the associa tion summary statistics for exome chip variants ought to be imputed using published HapMap association results. We improved on existing methods for summary statistics imputation by more accurate calculation of the imputation quality, accounting for variati ons in available sample size, and using UK10K sequencing data for LD esti mation with optimized shrinking. Our approach yielded a 10% reduction in root mean square error compared to standard methods. Variants with poor imputation quality (r2 0.8) markers, we additionally performed conditional summary statistic analysis to derive the effect of each (imputed) top exome variant conditional on all previously reported HapMap SNPs.

Families often have to cope with the difficul ties of having a disease without a name, lacking a precise genetic counselling hampering parenthood projects and inappropriate clinical management. Whole exome sequencing (WES) offers an unprecedented tool for genetic te sting without a priori hypotheses, specifically appropriated for undiagnosed patients with a developmental disorder. For patients with negative results of a diagnostic interpretation, a genotype first approach may be fruitful in assessing whether a genotype, or variants in a candidate gene, can recur rently be responsible for clinically recognizable phenotypes. International data sharing allows the identification of similar patients with ultra rare dis orders.

This was proposed to families after a clinical WES performed in a regional centre in a diagnostic setting. By com bining several methods for data sharing, and participating to the Ã¢ÂÂMatch maker ExchangeÃ¢ÂÂ initiative, new disease causing genes were identified and could ultimately lead to a diagnosis for the families.

Should NIPT become available as a first tier screening test, the role of midwives will become even more important as 80% of pregnant women are counseled in primary care. We assessed midwivesÃ¢ÂÂ attitudes, knowledge and educational needs regarding NIPT .Methods: Online survey completed by 436 (of the 2106) Dutch midwives, April June 2015. Results: The majority (68%) of midwives were in favour of replacing FCT by NIPT , although 40% preferred to maintain nuchal translucency measure ment. Only 2% preferred to implement NIPT after FCT with a lower risk cut off (>1:1000). Midwives were worried that women would not want to (74%) and/or cannot (65%) pay the estimated costs of NIPT (~530 euros). In total, 63% had followed training on NIPT .

Most midwives (87%) felt confident about counseling for NIPT; 60% believed counseling will become easier. Conclusions: MidwivesÃ¢ÂÂ attitudes towards NIPT as first tier screening test are positive, but many prefer to maintain NT measurement. Midwives worry that many women will not or cannot pay for NIPT which may lead to inequa lity. Knowledge seems good but can be improved in some aspects.

24999,"Introduction: In the Netherlands, there is broad societal and political sup port for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) if one of the parents is a carrier of HD. However, policymakers and funders expressed concerns about facilitating reproductive options that lead to children who will inevi tably be confronted with a parent with HD, and grow up in potential distres sing circumstances with consequently impairment of the quality of their life. To meet those concerns, we examined psychological functioning, coping and dynamics in these families. Methods: We conducted 10 semi structured interviews with 7 couples and 3 single parents who gave birth to at least one child after PGD. None of the carriers were symptomatic at the time of testing (1994 2011). At the time of the interview, 2 parents were symptomatic, one was deceased. Interviews were audio taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Results: PGD met parentsÃ¢ÂÂ expectations regarding relief from guilt feelings towards their child(ren). Those who had previous prenatal diagnosis repor ted that termination of pregnancy was extremely psychological burdening, whereas for PGD the procedure was more physically distressing. As long as the carrier parent was asymptomatic, the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs focus was mainly on the individual future disease process. When the carrier parent becomes sym ptomatic, the family becomes insidiously aware of the far reaching impact on all involved, which may initially have been underestimated. Conclusions: We did not observe specific issues related to PGD. However, it is of uttermost importance that parents have access to specific health care supporting the family system in issues related to (future) HD.",2016
25000,"Background and aims: In case of an increased risk at first trimester scree ning, most centers offer further testing by non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), or invasive prenatal diagnosis (PND) with rapid aneuploidy de tection. In contrast, we offer whole genome SNP array analysis at 0.5 Mb resolution, which has a broader scope. We aimed to investigate whether pregnant women and their partners made informed choices between NIPT and array testing after routine pre test counselling. Methods: 330 women and 103 partners participated. Informed choice was defined as a behaviorally implemented choice that is attitude consistent and based on sufficient knowledge, measured with the Measure of Informed Choice. Three categories of informed decision making were formed, 1) com pletely informed, 2) partly informed and 3) completely uninformed. Results: 87% chose NIPT , 12% chose invasive PND. Twenty six percent of the NIPT group made completely informed choices, versus 85% of the par ticipants who opted for PND. In the NIPT group, 60% of choices were based on sufficient knowledge, but were inconsistent with attitude, versus 32% in the PND group. Scrutinizing the attitudes, we found that 25% of participants choosing NIPT did prefer broader testing, but were held back by risks of an invasive procedure. Conclusions: Most women and their partners highly valued the avoidance of a miscarriage risk over invasive PND. Their attitudes indicate they would prefer results comparable to whole genome testing, but safely, i.e. perfor med by NIPT .

The disadvantages inclu ded the medical actions involved (57%), the need for hormonal treatment (56%) and long waiting lists for the procedure (42%).Understanding attitudes and experiences of couples who already performed PGD will deepen the insights of the special needs of this particular group, and should play a crucial role in developing programs for counseling, direc ting and accompanying future PGD users.",2016

Secondary aims were to elucidate reasons for accepting or declining PND and investigate differences between the accepting and declining group in perceived infor mation, knowing someone with DS and thoughts about decision making. Method: A questionnaire was completed by 76 pregnant women who under went invasive testing and 65 women who declined tests for chromosomal aberrations. Results: Apart from one question no significant differences were found in knowledge of DS between women declining or accepting PND for DS. Both groups had varying and in several aspects low levels of knowledge about DS and its consequences. Most common reasons to accept PND were Ã¢ÂÂto ease my worriesÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂto do all possible tests to make sure the baby is healthyÃ¢ÂÂ. Corresponding statements declining PND were Ã¢ÂÂtermination of pregnancy is not an optionÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂbecause invasive tests increase the risk of miscarriageÃ¢ÂÂ. More women declining PND knew someone with DS. Conclusion: Knowledge of DS at these levels is not a major factor when wo men decide to accept or decline PND for DS. Their choice is mostly based on opinions and moral values. C10 Epigenetic mechanisms in development and disease",2016
25004,"Changes in bone size and shape are defining features of many vertebrates, and underlie many of the traits that make us uniquely human.

Freshwater fish have a cis acting regulatory change that in creases GDF6 expression, and transgenic overexpression phenocopies evo lutionary changes in dermal bone size. Comparative genomics revealed that the human GDF6 locus also has undergone distinctive regulatory evolution, including complete loss of an enhancer that is highly conserved in other mammals. Functional tests show that the ancestral enhancer drives expres sion in hindlimbs but not forelimbs, in locations that have been specifically modified during the human transition to bipedalism.

25005,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is characterized by the absence of enteric ganglia along a variable portion of the distal gastrointestinal tract, which results in functional intestinal obstruction. This rare developmental disor der (1/5,000 live births) is attributed to a failure of the neural crest cells (NCC) to migrate, proliferate, differentiate or survive and to form the enteric nervous system (ENS). Isolated or syndromic forms of HSCR have a complex genetic etiology with a dozen factors involved, including EDN3, its receptor EDNRB and the transcription factors SOX10 and ZEB2.Over the last ten years, we have studied the role of these factors during ENS development and characterized the genetic and functional interactions among them. We showed that genetic interactions between Sox10 and Zeb2 or Edn3/Ednrb are essential for enteric NCC survival and differentiation. However, the cellular and molecular contribution of Zeb2 remains unclear. Here, the generation and characterization of the double mutant mice Zeb2 Edn3 and Zeb2 Ednrb revealed a genetic interaction between these three genes in ENS development. Indeed, double mutants present with increased distal aganglionosis as compared to single mutants. In parallel, gene regu lation studies combined with enteric progenitor culture and rescue experi ments allowed us to demonstrate the transcriptional regulation of EDNRB by SOX10 and ZEB2 and the essential role of the SOX10/ZEB2/EDN3 Ã¢ÂÂtria deÃ¢ÂÂ in controlling the differentiation status of enteric NCC. With these results, we can now integrate ZEB2 in the genetic interaction network known to be involved in ENS development, leading to a better un derstanding of the cellular bases of HSCR.",2016
25006,"Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive during infancy, and, subsequently, by obesity, hyperphagia, cognitive disability and behavioral abnormalities. This neurobehavioral dis order of genomic imprinting is caused by the lack of expression of genes on the paternally inherited chromosome 15q11.2 q13 region. The detailed ge netic basis of PWS is complex involving the loss of active copies of a cluster of non coding box C/D class small nucleolar RNAs, the SNORD116 snoRNAs. In stem cell models of PWS, we previously identified a new epigenetic com plex, composed of the zinc finger protein ZNF274 and the SET domain, bi furcated 1 (SETDB1) histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase, that is involved in silencing the maternal copy of the PWS critical region (PWS CR) encompassing the SNORD116 cluster. Here, using genome editing approaches, we have knocked out ZNF274 ex pression in PWS specific iPSC lines from multiple PWS patients with di verse genetic abnormalities and showed that the extent of transcriptional re activation of PWS CR genes varies during in vitro neurogenesis. While PWS CR gene expression in ZNF274 knockout (KO) iPSCs is ~5 % of normal levels, wild type mRNA levels are completely restored in neurons derived from PWS ZNF274 KO iPSCs. Surprisingly, the DNA methylation at the PWS IC remains unchanged upon ZNF274 KO, suggesting that the ZNF274 com plex acts as a second imprinting mechanism regulating the PWS CR gene expression during the course of neurogenesis. Our data further support the finding that ZNF274 may represent a potential target for future therapeutic applications to rescue the PWS phenotype.",2016
25007,"Our research focuses on when and how FMR1 gains aberrant methylati on, and whether hypermethylation is mechanistically associated with CGG somatic instability. Taking advantage of a large set of FXS HESC lines (9 in total), we show that FMR1 epigenetic gene silencing commonly occurs in the undifferentiated cells and that FXS HESC lines are heterogeneous for re peat size and methylation levels. By monitoring single cell lineages of FXS HESCs and patient derived iPS cells over time in culture, we demonstrate that CGG instability in fact exists in these cells, and is largely correlated with ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

Furthermore, we provide evidence for the existence of R Loops near the CGG repeats in FXS HESCs/iPS with an active FMR1, and demonstrate their co existence with single strand DNA slip outs from the G rich non template DNA. Taken together, we propose that the variability in methylation levels within undifferentiated FXS HESC lines re flects a widespread event within mutant FMR1 embryos, where methylation state is initially set. In accordance with our findings, we put forward a model that relies on R loop formation to explain how epigenetics and gene tran scription are mechanistically associated with CGG somatic instability in FXS.",2016
25008,"It has been recently shown that the chromatin landscape of the human ge nome is organized into non uniformly distributed chromatin modules re gions of coordinated behavior of multiple chromatin marks. These modules may represent either active elements of regulatory transcription units or their passive chromatin footprints. To describe the structures of these units, find the patterns of their location, decipher the main factors driving these coordinated behaviors and ultimately reveal their functions, we need to be able to define and reconstruct these modules with high precision. Towards this we have annotated genome wide inter individual variation in sever al chromatin modifications representing active marks (i.e. enrichment of H3K27ac histone modifications), promoter marks (H3K4me3), enhancer marks (H3K4me1), genetic polymorphisms (>7.5M SNPs) and expression level (RNA seq) in lymphoblastoid cell lines of 200 individuals. Using this high resolution data set we discovered a fractal structure of the chromatin interactions. To uncover main factors and mechanisms maintaining these chromatin interactions along the human genome we analyzed their distri bution upon stratification for evolutionary (i.e. density and properties of genes involved in the interactions), topological (i.e. variation in DNA topo logy between different cell lines and species) and replication (i.e. variation in replication timing) constraints. We consider the fractal network of the chromatin interactions as a meta phenotype which can explain better the links between genotype and higher level phenotypes such as transcriptome variation.",2016

Our recent findings indicated a possible contribution of ciliary dysfunction to the phenotypes of the 16p11.2 CNVs. To potentially identify driver and modifier genes of the 16p11.2 endophenotypes we have sequen ced the exomes and the transcriptomes of 250 deeply phenotyped individu als from 16p11.2 families. To avoid ascertainment bias and better represent the phenotypic spectrum, we recruited carriers among unselected popu lation cohorts, as well as in clinical settings. We are cataloging potentially deleterious variants in the 16p11.2 altered pathways, and performing cor relative analyses between quantitative traits (e.g. BMI, IQ) and transcript levels. Our results will be replicated with 306 exomes of 16p11.2 trios from the Simons VIP Consortium. The pilot phase of data analysis identified slightly deleterious variants in 16p11.2 interacting genes that potentially contribute to vertebral and MÃÂ¼l lerian duct defects recurrently seen in a subset of 16p11.2 patients. We have also identified, for example, an individual carrying a 16p11.2 deletion and a heterozygous loss of function variant in the pan ciliopathy gene CEP290, and an individual with a 16p11.2 duplication and a non synonymous mu tation in the rasopathy gene PTPN11.

A particularly remarkable example is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), one of the most common autosomal reces sive disorders in humans. Twenty years after SMN1 has been discovered as the SMA determining gene, a major unsolved question is still which cellular mechanism leads to motoneuron dysfunction and ultimately to SMA. Here we demonstrate the power of the protective genetic modifier, plastin 3 (PLS3) to answer this question. Homozygous loss of SMN1 causes SMA. SMN2 produces ~10% functional SMN protein, insufficient to counteract ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 32Back to index SMA. In contrast, elevated PLS3, an F actin bundling protein fully protects against SMA in SMN1 deleted individuals, carrying 3 4 SMN2 copies. We prove here that PLS3 rescued survival (>250 days) and motoric abilities in an intermediate SMA mouse model. Since PLS3 knock out in yeast impairs endocytosis, we hypothesized that disturbed endocytosis might be a key cel lular mechanism underlying impaired neurotransmission and NMJ mainte nance in SMA. Indeed, SMN deficit dramatically reduced endocytosis, which was restored to normal levels by PLS3 overexpression. Under low frequency electro stimulation, endocytic FM 143 uptake at NMJ level was restored to control levels in SMA PLS3 as compared to SMA mice. Moreover, proteomics and biochemical analysis unraveled CORO1C, another F actin binding pro tein, to directly bind to PLS3 in a calcium dependent manner. As PLS3, CO RO1C overexpression restored fluid phase endocytosis in SMN knockdown cells by elevating F actin levels and rescued the axonal truncation and bran ching phenotype in Smn depleted fish.

25011,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is associated with the partial chromatin relaxation of the DUX4 encoding D4Z4 macrosatellite re peat located on chromosome 4, and transcriptional derepression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. D4Z4 chromatin relaxation is consistently marked by CpG hypomethylation at the DUX4 promoter. In the most common form, FSHD1, D4Z4 chromatin relaxation is caused by a D4Z4 repeat array contraction to 1 10 units (normal range 8 100 units). In the rare form of FSHD, FSHD2, D4Z4 chromatin relaxation occurs on all D4Z4 arrays and is most often caused by mutations in the D4Z4 chromatin repressor SMCHD1.Not all FSHD2 cases can be explained by SMCHD1 mutations, thus we per formed whole exome sequencing in FSHD families with D4Z4 hypomethyla tion lacking SMCHD1 mutations. In two families we identified heterozygous mutations in DNMT3B, which segregated with D4Z4 hypomethylation and increased FSHD penetrance. Recessive DNMT3B mutations were previous ly shown to cause Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies syndrome type 1 (ICF1). These FSHD patients donÃ¢ÂÂt have immu nodeficiency, but ICF1 patients might be at risk of expressing DUX4 and de veloping FSHD. We propose that the effect of DNMT3B mutations on DUX4 expression and disease presentation, like for SMCHD1, depends on several aspects associated with the FSHD locus including D4Z4 repeat size, and the presence of a polymorphic DUX4 polyadenylation signal. This study suggests that multiple factors are involved in the epigenetic state at D4Z4 and the regulation of DUX4.Grant references:Neuromics, Prinses Beatrix Spierfonds, NIH NINDS, FSH society, Spieren voor Spieren, Friends of FSH Research.",2016
25012,"Background: Congenital myopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by early childhood hypotonia and muscle weakness. They are sub classified in seven distinct types based on clinical presentation and characteristic features on biopsy. To date, more than 30 genes have been associated with congenital myopathies and a large number of patients are still without a diagnostic. Methods: In order to identify the causative gene, three consanguineous families, from different ethnic backgrounds, were exome sequenced inde pendently. RNA sequencing was also performed on muscle biopsy from one affected. Results: Whole exome sequencing identified homozygous truncating muta tions in ZAK, encoding for the sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper con taining kinase. RNA sequencing confirmed a decreased expression of ZAK in muscle, suggesting mRNA decay. Transcriptome analysis showed simi larities of affected pathways with other muscle diseases including the up regulation of extracellular matrix components as well as a down regulation of sarcomeric genes. Conclusion: In this study, we linked a loss of function mutation in ZAK with congenital myopathy. Although transcriptome analysis was performed on only one patient, we obtained results suggesting affected pathways common to other myopathies.

25013,"Four genes encoding aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARSs) cause dominant, axonal Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease, which is characterized by impai red motor and sensory function in the distal extremities. ARS genes impli cated in dominant CMT disease thus far are glycyl (GARS), tyrosyl (YARS), alanyl (AARS), and histidyl tRNA synthetase (HARS). Functional analyses revealed that CMT associated ARS mutations reduce enzymatic activity, sug gesting that impaired tRNA charging is a component of disease pathogene sis. Currently, ARS variants of unknown pathogenicity are being discovered rapidly, making it important to proactively determine the subset of variants relevant to CMT disease. We performed a forward mutation screen in yeast that revealed 17 novel loss of function GARS and AARS mutations, one of which was subsequently found in a patient with CMT disease. These func tional data contributed to a rapid patient diagnosis. We are expanding the se efforts via programmed allelic series (PALS) in allelically heterogeneous yeast growth assays. If impaired tRNA charging causes CMT disease, then mutations in other ARS genes may cause this phenotype. To test this, we identified loss of function missense mutations in an ARS not yet associated with disease [threonyl (TARS)] and evaluated them for dominant toxicity in C. elegans. This revealed two classes of mutations: those toxic to neurons and those not toxic to neurons. These Ã¢ÂÂseparation of functionÃ¢ÂÂ mutations will be essential for determining the molecular pathology of ARS associated CMT disease, which we are pursuing in mouse. Combined, our data suggest that mutations in a broader panel of ARS genes cause dominant CMT disease and that improving ARS function is a relevant therapeutic strategy.",2016

Chorea is a hyperkinetic movement disorder resulting from dysfunction of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which form the main basal ganglia output projections. Here we used whole exome sequencing to unravel the underlying genetic cause in three unrelated individuals with a very similar and unique clinical presentation of childhood onset chorea and characteri stic brain MRI showing symmetrical bilateral striatal lesions. All cases were identified to carry a de novo heterozygous mutation in PDE10A (c.898T>C; p. Phe300Leu in two cases and c.1000T>C; p. Phe334Leu in one case), enco ding a phosphodiesterase highly and selectively expressed in MSNs. PDE10A contributes to the regulation of the intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Both substitutions affect highly conserved amino acids located in the re gulatory GAF B domain, which, by binding to cAMP , stimulates the activity of the PDE10A catalytic domain. In silico modeling shows that the mutated residues are located deep into the binding pocket, where they are likely to alter cAMP binding properties. In vitro functional studies showed that both substitutions do not affect the basal PDE10A activity, but severely disrupt the stimulatory effect mediated by cAMP binding to the GAF B domain. The identification of PDE10A mutations as a cause of chorea further motivates the study of cAMP signaling in MSNs, and highlights the crucial role of stria tal cAMP signaling in the regulation of basal ganglia circuitry. Pharmacologi cal modulation of this pathway may offer promising aetiologically targeted treatments for chorea and other hyperkinetic movement disorders. C12 Molecular Dysmorphology",2016

Approximately 50% of instances of FMD are allelic to the otopalatodigital spectrum disorders caused by gain of func tion mutations in FLNA, the mechanism by which these mutations result in hyperostosis is unknown. Using whole exome and targeted Sanger sequen cing in 20 cases of FLNA negative FMD, we found three mutations in genes encoding two components of the TGFÃÂ² activated kinase (TAK1) complex. Fifteen individuals had the same mutation, c.1454C>T , in MAP3K7 which encodes TAK1 kinase. A second de novo mutation in MAP3K7 , c.502G>C was discovered in a single individual. A second gene, TAB2 which encodes TAK1 binding protein 2, was shown to have the de novo mutation, c.1705G>A in a single instance. TAK1, a MAP 3 kinase, is activated via autophosphorylation within its kinase domain. We show the TAK1 mutations are gain of function, resulting in a hyper phosphorylated protein when expressed with TAB2. All three mutations variably alter the activity of more than one signalling pa thway regulated by this kinase complex. This includes increased p38 MAPK activation, a key pathway which regulates osteoblastogenesis. These fin dings show dysregulation of the TAK1 signalling complex produces a close phenocopy of FMD caused by mutations in FLNA.

Although numerous chromosomal abnormali ties have been associated with OAVS, no causative gene has been identified so far. Among other environmental factors, Retinoic Acid (RA) has already been described as a teratogenic agent leading to OAVS features in humans. As sporadic cases are mostly described in GS, we have performed whole exome sequencing on selected affected individuals and their unaffected parents, looking for de novo mutations. Consequently, we identified a he terozygous nonsense mutation in one patient in the MYT1 gene. Further, we detected one heterozygous missense mutation in another patient from a cohort of 169 OAVS patients. This gene encodes the Myelin Transcription factor 1 which is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system. Functional studies by transient knockdown of myt1a, homolog of MYT1 in zebrafish, led to specific craniofacial cartilages alterations and to the up regulation of Neural Crest Cells marker sox10 . Moreover, cells studies con firmed close links between MYT1, RA and the RA receptor beta (RARB). Indeed, All trans RA (ATRA) treatment led to an upregulation of cellular endogenous MYT1 expression. Additionally, cellular wild type MYT1 overex pression induced a down regulation of RARB leading to a negative feedback of the RA signaling pathway, whereas mutated MYT1 did not, confirming the pathogenic effect of the mutations.

This DNA bound complex regulates chromatin related processes like chromosome segregation, DNA damage repair, transcription and chromatin structure. Here we report on a family with two children and a mother with clinical features reminiscent of CdLS. While gene panel sequencing approaches failed to identify the disease causing mutation, an 87 kb spanning deletion co segregating with the phe notype was identified by array CGH. Besides the coding region of CYLC2, encoding a sperm head protein, no other genes were affected. Subsequent in silico analyses predicted the existence of a ~3 kb tissue specific regula tory element within this region, approximately 1 Mb distant from the next protein coding gene SMC2, which encodes a subunit of the cohesin related condensin complex.

SGS is caused by de novo germline mutations clustering within a 12 bp exonic region in SETBP1. Interestingly, identical mutations in SETBP1 occur somatically in myeloid leukemia, leading to increased cell proliferation. The aim of our study is to analyze comparatively germline and somatic SETBP1 mutations to gain insight into genotype phenotype correlations for SGS and into the molecular basis of SGS. We have gathered clinical information from over 45 SGS patients, constitu ting the largest SGS cohort yet. Comparing SETBP1 mutations in SGS and in leukemia shows that, despite sharing an overlap, the distribution of muta tions within the hotspot differs between both conditions. Overexpression experiments confirm that mutations in the SETBP1 hotspot destroy a de gron and lead to increased SETBP1 protein, with different mutations having varying effects on SETBP1 stability and protein levels. Furthermore, we perform saturation genome editing (Findlay et al. Nature 2014) to analyze the effect of all theoretically possible mutations in the SETBP1 hotspot and surrounding region. In silico modeling and functional studies substantiate that mutations seen more frequently in SGS are functionally weaker than those more prevalent in leukemia. Clinical data supports this finding; SGS patients with germline SETBP1 mutations shown to be functionally stron ger and more prevalent in leukemia show increased cell proliferation in vi tro, increased incidence of malignancy and decreased survival.

In recent years, the deployment of technologies for the analy sis of cell free fetal DNA, such as digital PCR and NGS, allowed for the im plementation of various non invasive prenatal tests in clinical practice and opened the way to the diagnosis of single gene disorders. However, to date, it has only being offered for paternal and de novo mutation exclusion, the study of the maternal inheritance remaining challenging because of the high levels of maternal background. Methods. We collected 190 plasma samples from women that underwent a classic invasive prenatal diagnosis for Achondroplasia, Cystic Fibrosis, Du chenne Myopathy, Hemophilia or Neurofibromatosis Type 1. Digital droplet PCR assays specifically designed for wild type and mutant alleles were used to evaluate the observed allelic balance in maternal plasma. A precisely de rived Likelihood Ratio Test, taking account of the inheritance pattern, the nature of the mutation and the observed fetal fraction, was used to infer the fetal genotype. Results. Concerning de novo and paternally inherited mutations, fetal geno type was determined correctly in 100% of the tested cases (49 samples) with fetal fraction >1%. About maternally inherited mutations, we showed that the percentage of conclusive results highly depends both on the avai lable amount of cell free DNA and the fetal fraction, thus leading us to pro pose recommendations in terms of blood volume to collect, for each type of single gene disorder. Conclusion. This proof of concept study of non invasive droplet digital PCR technology for the analysis of both paternally and maternally inherited fetal alleles demonstrates that NIPT for single gene disorders is now becoming achievable.

Materials and Methods: We applied the testing strategy to14 euploid fe tuses, from 11 on going pregnancies and 3 products of abortion, all with various ultrasound abnormalities. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was fol lowed by variant prioritization, utilizing a custom analysis pipeline (Fetalis algorithm), targeting 758 genes associated with genetic disorders which may present with abnormal fetal ultrasound findings. Results: A definitive or highly likely diagnosis was made in 6 of 14 cases (43%), involving 3 abortuses and 3 on going pregnancies. In the remaining 8 on going pregnancy cases (57%), a ZIC1 variant of unknown clinical signi ficance was detected in one case, while 7 cases did not harbor pathogenic variant(s).

Transcriptome wide gene expression profiles were studied for 12 and 18 month old mice analogous to human Lynch syndrome (LS) (Mlh1+/ ), and their wild type littermates (Mlh1+/+). Fur thermore, tumor phenotypes, microsatellite instability (MSI) and mismatch repair protein (MMR) loss, linked to LS were characterized. Altogether 6 CRCs were detected and 5 of them in WD fed mice. Interestingly, our results show that expression profiles of histologically normal mucosa from mice which developed CRC form a distinct cluster compared to healthy controls in MDS plot created with 100 most regulated genes in the CRC developing samples. The genes were selected with shrinkage T test. This kind of cluste ring clearly indicates a colon wide field effect of CRC predisposing events in the normal colon mucosa. It is assumed that MMR gene inactivation and consequent tumor initiation follows the classical two hit model. Our results, however, suggest that already decreased amount of Mlh1, when MMR is still intact, may be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis. Lynch syndrome mice did not lack Mlh1 or show MSI in their tumors, although Mlh1 RNA expression was already significantly decreased in their mucosa. The study was supported by grants from European Research Council (2008 AdG 232635), Jenny and Antti Wihuri foundation.",2016
25027,"Aims: Currently, one of the major challenges in genetic testing is determi ning the functional effect of (rare) variants. Here, we propose a novel in vivo approach to study the functionality of BRCA2 missense variants in zebrafish. We propose an in vivo functional assay to measure in embryos the capacity of homologous recombination for human BRCA2 mRNA containing variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS).Methods: We create DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in zebrafish embryos by irradiation. We use yH2AX and RAD51 foci assays as markers for DSB and HR repair respectively. We generated zebrafish brca2 knockdown models by morpholino injection and Crispr Cas9. After synthesis of human BRCA2 mRNA, rescue experiments will be performed with wild type mRNA and mRNA containing the VUS of interest. Results: We developed a protocol for visualising and quantifying RAD51 foci in tissues of wild type zebrafish embryos. Knockdown of brca2 by a mor pholino results in almost complete absence of RAD51 foci in irradiated em bryos. Similar results are currently being generated in the Crispr Cas9 brca2 knockout model. In a next step we will rescue the phenotype by microinjec tion of wild type human BRCA2 mRNA and mRNA containing VUS to study the effect of these VUS on the HR capacity. Conclusions: The zebrafish genome contains nearly all the genes involved in different DNA repair pathways in eukaryotes, including, homologous re combination (HR), in which BRCA2 plays a major role. Therefore, zebrafish provide an ideal in vivo model for studying variants in genes involved in DNA damage and repair. ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25028,"Li Fraumeni syndrome, due to TP53 germline mutations, is characterized by an exceptional high risk of multiple primary tumours. Considering that p53 pathway is activated in response to DNA damage, we recently developed an universal genotoxicity assay based on the transcriptional induction of TP53 target genes in human lymphocytes exposed to DNA damaging agents (Zer doumi et al., Mutat Res 2015). To evaluate the impact of genotoxic agents in vivo, we first characterized the mouse transcriptome in response to DNA damage, selected Trp53 target genes, developed a similar genotoxic assay in mice based on the ex vivo exposure of mouse splenocytes and then di rectly performed the assay after intraperitoneal (IP) injection of chemo therapies. The mouse ex vivo and in vivo genotoxic assays showed, like the assay performed in human lymphocytes, that all classical chemotherapies, except microtubule poisons, are strongly genotoxic. We then submitted 6 weeks old Trp53 / LFS mice and Trp53 wt/wt control mice to IP injec tion of chemotherapies or radiotherapy and performed monthly total body MRI. We found that genotoxic chemotherapies and radiotherapy accelerate the development of malignant solid tumours and hemopathies in Trp53 / mice. All these results strongly support that cancer treatments contribute to the development of secondary tumours in LFS and explain the sequential occurrence of tumours observed in LFS patients. This indicates that, in LFS patients, radiotherapy should be avoided, whenever possible, and that non genotoxic chemotherapies should be evaluated in order to reduce the risk of multiple primary cancers.",2016
25029,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a particularly aggressive blood cancer dif ficult to treat because of its recurrence affecting differentiation of hemato poietic progenitors. It is hypothesized that relapse of AML is due to incom plete eradication of leukemic stem cells (LSC) with self renewal and leuke mia initiating properties. Our ultimate goal is to characterize LSC based on their transcriptional profiling. Evidence suggests that CD34+CD38Ã¢ÂÂ cell population is enriched for LSCs but they remain rare and difficult to identify. Thus, we present a single cell RNA seq approach to characterize CD34+CD38 sorted cells in 2 AML indi viduals (AML1(M0), AML2(M5)) at the time of diagnosis and in 4 unaffected individuals (N). For 311 single cells, 1764 genes were detected on average (RPKM>10). We identified 763 and 858 significantly differentially expressed genes in AML2 and AML1, respectively using D3E. We demonstrate that the captured AML cells possess the hallmarks of LSC. The top highly expressed genes are stem markers including SOX4, CD74, CD69 and CXCL8. In particu lar, HOXA B cluster genes appeared markedly dysregulated demonstrating their leukemia initiating capability. Gene ontology revealed enrichment for annotation of apoptotic resistance and self renewal capacity as well. Fur thermore, 3 distinct clusters of co expressed genes were identified that di stinguished between N cells and AML cells with M0 and M5 (SEURAT tool).Finally, we hypothesized that prognostic gene expression signature is pre sent at diagnosis. Using TCGA RNA seq and clinical datasets, we identified genes whose expression correlated with AML patient survival. We confir med their differential expression in AML single cells and thus, their con tribution in leukemogenesis and potential relevance for clinical outcome prediction.",2016
25030,"Recent genomic studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have relied upon genome wide characterization of coding mutations using whole exome sequencing (WES) and copy number variants (CNV) using chromosomal microarray (CMA). In ASD, these efforts have revealed a strong associati on with de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and CNVs segments that alter the dosage of genes under evolutionary constraint. Unfortunately, the impact of balanced and complex structural variation (SV), which also repre sent LoF variation, remains uncharacterized in ASD and other human disea se studies. Here, we explored the full mutational spectrum of SV contribu ting to ASD by integrating large insert, short insert and synthetic long read whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies with CMA in 307 idiopathic ASD probands and 120 family members from the Simons Simplex Collec tion. Analyses revealed a diverse landscape of SVs beyond canonical CNVs, including inversions, insertions, and translocations. We also categorized 13 distinct subclasses of recurrent complex SVs and demonstrate that each ge nome sequenced harbored at least one such large complex rearrangement (~5 kb resolution). We identified 26 de novo SVs likely contributing to ASD, 50% of which were cryptic to detection by previous technologies on the se same samples. These data confirmed 13 previously proposed ASD risk factors and discovered 12 novel candidates. We estimate that the overall contribution of de novo SVs in ASD at this resolution to be at least 8.2%, or a two fold increase over previous analyses restricted to CNVs. These data suggest that cryptic and complex SV represent an important and presently underappreciated component of ASD etiology. ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25031,"Copy number variants (CNVs) of the distal 16p11.2 220kb BP2 BP3 regi on show mirror effect on BMI and head size, and association with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia, as previously reported for the proximal 16p11.2 600kb BP4 BP5 deletion and duplication. These two CNVs prone regions at 16p11.2 are also reciprocally engaged in complex chromatin looping, successfully confirmed by 4C, FISH, Hi C and concomi tant expression changes. We assessed the 220kb BP2 BP3 duplication by overexpressing each of the 9 encompassed human transcripts, CD19, NFAT C2IP , ATXN2L, TUFM, ATP2A1, RABEP2, SPNS1, LAT and SH2B1, in zebrafish embryos. Overexpression of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) induced a reduction in dividing cells in the brain and number of post mitotic neurons in the anterior forebrain at 2dpf, and of intertectal axonal tracts at 3dpf, re sulting in microcephaly at later stages. We showed similar results upon ove rexpression of CD247 and ZAP70, two genes belonging to the LATÃ¢ÂÂs immune system signaling pathway. Co injections experiments showed that KCTD13, MVP , and MAPK3, three genes mapping within the 600kb BP4 BP5 locus and major driver and modifiers, respectively, of the head circumference pheno type linked to that region, and LAT acted in an additive manner to increase the severity of the microcephaly phenotype, suggesting the presence of ge netic interaction. Chromatin conformation capture further showed that LAT cis and trans interacting chromatin partners were enriched for ASD genes (p,5.6E 03, OR,1.9).

25032,"Introduction: Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are genetically heterogeneous, and associated genes for both condi tions overlap substantially. Few mutations in POGZ were reported in recent exome studies. However, these studies did not provide detailed clinical in formation, leaving the pathogenicity and a clear phenotypic definition of the POGZ patient unknown. Patients and Methods: We collected the clinical and molecular data of 25 individuals with disruptive mutations in POGZ identified by diagnostic who le exome, whole genome, or targeted sequencing of 5,223 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (ID primarily) or by targeted resequencing of this locus in 12,041 individuals with ASD and/or ID. In parallel, we utili zed a Drosophila knockdown model of the POGZ orthologue row to provide further support for the importance of POGZ in cognitive function. Results: We defined common phenotypic features of POGZ patients, inclu ding variable levels of developmental delay and more severe speech and language delay compared to motor delay and coordination issues. We also identified significant associations with vision problems, microcephaly, hy peractivity, a tendency to obesity and feeding difficulties. In addition, we found that downregulation of row expression, specifically in neurons, leads to deficits in habituation, a form of non associative learning that is highly relevant for both ID and ASD. Conclusion: Combined, these data underscore the pathogenicity of loss of function mutations in POGZ and define a novel POGZ related syndrome. Some features may be explained by the high expression of POGZ early in fetal brain development, particularly in the cerebellum and pituitary.",2016
25033,"About one third of patients with schizophrenia do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication, and are thus considered to have treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS). This is one of the most disabling forms of mental illness and constitutes a major challenge and cost to public health, affecting at least 1 million people solely in Europe. The only drug backed by evidence based studies as a prescription for TRS is the atypical antipsy chotic clozapine, which requires frequent blood monitoring due to rare but potentially lethal adverse effects. Through an agreement with the major pharmaceutical companies that market clozapine in the UK (Novartis and Leyden Delta) we collected blood samples of 15,210 anonymous clozapine takers, which were genotyped on the Illumina OmniExpress beadchip by the Broad Institute of MIT and Har vard (Cambridge, USA) and deCODE genetics (ReykjavÃÂ­k, Iceland). We ob tained genotype data from 25,811 unscreened control individuals through public sources and collaboration with large scale genotyping projects. Ana lysis of this dataset showed significant associations in known schizophrenia loci (TSNARE1, CACNA1C, DRD2) and novel signals (RAPGEF4, ZNF664) which have been previously linked to brain development. In order to clarify the relationship between broad sense schizophrenia and TRS, we generated polygenic risk prediction scores from the largest available schizophrenia GWAS (Ripke et al. 2015), which were used to calculate risk profiles in TRS individuals. There was no compelling evidence of a stronger polygenic si gnal in this analysis, disputing the view that TRS represents simply a severe form of schizophrenia.

Introduction: Microtubules are crucial cytoplasmic structures regulating neuronal cells migration and polarity which are key processes in brain mor phogenesis. Their important role in human brain development is highligh ted by the neurological disorders arising from mutations in genes encoding tubulins or their cellular interacting partners. Materials and methods: Using genome wide SNP genotyping paralleled with whole exome sequencing, we investigated a large multigenerational Omani pedigree and a single nuclear family from India to identify the genetic basis of a severe autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental condition with cardi nal features of microcephaly and global developmental delay. We performed in vitro cell assays to examine the functional consequences of the identified mutations in key cellular processes. Results: We identified two novel mutations in the PRUNE gene affecting key functional motifs of the encoded protein: (c.88G>A/ p. Asp30Asn) in the ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 39Back to index extended Omani family, and (c.889C>T/ p. Arg297Trp) in the Indian family. Our studies identified PRUNE as a binding partner of ÃÂ² tubulin crucial for tubulin polymerization. This interaction is impaired by both mutations as shown by disrupted subcellular co localizations and undermined in vitro microtubules assembly. We also show that both mutations impair in vitro cell migration, proliferation and differentiation which are processes nor mally enhanced by wild type PRUNE. Conclusions: Our data confirm the essential role of tubulin related proteins in cortical development and define PRUNE as a pivotal interacting molecule important for normal microtubule assembly which may be mutated to result in human microcephaly and a global neurodevelopmental delay phenotype.

25035,"Primary microcephaly is a congenital neurodevelopmental disorder of re duced head circumference and brain volume, with fewer neurons in the cortex of the developing brain due to premature transition between sym metrical and asymmetrical cellular division of the neuronal stem cell layer during neurogenesis. We now show through linkage analysis and whole exo me sequencing, that a dominant mutation in ALFY, encoding an autophagy scaffold protein, causes human primary microcephaly. We demonstrate the dominant effect of the mutation in drosophila: transgenic flies harboring the human mutant allele display small brain volume, recapitulating the di sease phenotype. Moreover, eye specific expression of human mutant ALFY causes rough eye phenotype. In molecular terms, we demonstrate that nor mally ALFY attenuates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway via autophagy dependent removal specifically of aggregates of DVL3 and not of Dvl1 or Dvl2. Thus, autophagic attenuation of Wnt signaling through removal of Dvl3 aggregates by ALFY acts in determining human brain size. C16 Bioinformatics, statistical and population genetic",2016
25036,"Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of loci associated with complex diseases. A next crucial step is fine mapping: iden tifying causal variants that point to molecular mechanisms behind the asso ciations and, eventually, suggest therapeutic targets. Recently, fine mapping methods have been extended to use only GWAS summary data together with pairwise correlations of the variants. Common to these approaches is that they rely on computationally expensive exhaustive search restricting their use to a few hundred variants. We introduce a software package FINEMAP that replaces the exhaustive search by an ultrafast stochastic search and the reby allows fine mapping analyses to scale up to whole chromosomes. We show that FINEMAP (1) opens up completely new opportunities by, e.g., exploring 15q21/LIPC locus for HDL cholesterol with 20,000 variants in less than 90 seconds while exhaustive search would require more than 9,000 years, (2) provides similar accuracy to exhaustive search when the latter can be completed, (3) achieves even higher accuracy when the latter must be restricted due to computational reasons, and (4) identifies more plausible variant combinations than conditional analysis. At 15q21/LIPC locus with at least a 3 SNP association pattern with HDL, a missense vari ant and a promoter polymorphism are likely to be causal whereas the lead variant in single SNP testing has less evidence than a regulatory variant cor related with it. We believe that FINEMAPÃ¢ÂÂs approach of jointly modeling the whole locus together with its unprecedented computational efficiency will help reveal valuable knowledge that could otherwise remain hidden due to limitations of existing fine mapping methods.",2016
25037,"Rare genetic disorders, which can now be studied systematically with af fordable genome sequencing, are often caused by high penetrance rare va riants. Such disorders are often heterogeneous and characterised by abnor malities spanning multiple organ systems ascertained with variable clinical precision. Existing methods for identifying genes with variants responsible for rare diseases summarise phenotypes with unstructured binary or quan titative variables. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) allows composite phenotypes to be represented systematically but association methods ac counting for the ontological relationship between HPO terms do not exist. We present a Bayesian method to model the association between an HPO coded patient phenotype and genotype. Our method estimates the probabi lity of an association together with an HPO coded phenotype characteristic of the disease. We thus formalise a clinical approach to phenotyping that is lacking in standard regression techniques for rare disease research.

25038,"Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) are widely applied in human disease genetics. We have developed the first dedicated software for calculating, testing and plotting the results of polygenic risk scores PRSice (Ã¢ÂÂpreciseÃ¢ÂÂ). To impro ve PRS predictive power further, we investigate an alternative approach to the selection of SNPs to calculate genetic risk, in particular in the context of applying PRS to assess shared genetic aetiology between different traits. By splitting the genome into chunks (eg. 5Mb regions) and selecting an optimum threshold for each chunk, we are able to select SNPs with large effects on the target phenotype but more modest effects on the discovery phenotype, which would have been omitted based on discovery P value alone. We demonstrate, via application to real and simulated data, that this novel method PRSlice can improve phenotype prediction across a num ber of common contingencies. We firstly focus on using summary data for one disease to predict risk of another comorbid phenotype this not only improves disease prediction in scenarios where the highest powered GWAS available is in a different but related trait, such as using BMI genetic risk to predict hypertension but also provides insight into the shared genetic architecture between complex traits. Secondly, we demonstrate the value of this approach for predicting genetic risk across different worldwide popu lations, an increasingly common analysis strategy, demonstrating that the effects of allelic heterogeneity can be accounted for.",2016
25039," Recurrent pathogenic deletions and duplications at chromosome 16p11.2 are mediated by a complex set of highly identical and directly oriented seg mental duplications. This disease predisposing architecture results from recent, Homo sapiens specific duplications (i.e. absent in Neanderthal and Denisovan) of a segment including the BOLA2 gene, the latest among a series of genomic changes that dramatically restructured the region during homi nid evolution. All humans examined (n , 2,359) carry one or more copies of the duplication, which nearly fixed early in the human lineageÃ¢ÂÂa pattern unlikely to have arisen so rapidly in the absence of selection (p < 0.009). We show that BOLA2 duplications affect its expression levels among indivi duals and between humans and other primates. Its copy number correlates with both RNA expression (r , 0.36) and protein level (r , 0.65) in human lymphoblastoid cell lines. BOLA2 is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells, where it shows the greatest expression difference between human and chimpanzee. BOLA2 localizes to the cell cortex and forms a [2Fe 2S] bridged heterotrimeric complex with GLRX3 (glutaredoxin 3). We show that in vitro increasing BOLA2 results in a shift from dimeric GLRX3 to heterotrimeric BOLA2/GLRX3 complex and the latter is 3 fold more stable upon air ex posure. We are currently investigating the cellular phenotypes associated with BOLA2 differential expression and oxidative stress conditions to gain insights into the possible advantage linked to the emergence of the BOLA2 gene family at the root of the Homo sapiens lineage.",2016
25040,"It has been shown that population specific reference panel improves impu tation accuracy especially in the case of rare and low frequency variants. We studied how much better we can impute variants using a population based sequence reference panel instead of commonly used global 1000 Genomes or the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) reference panels. Specifically, we evaluated the utility of extending the Finnish low coverage whole geno me sequencing (WGS) panel (N , 1,941) with a jointly called whole exome sequencing (WES) based reference panel (N , 4,932) to successfully impu te coding variation into our test dataset of 10,489 Finns. Using the Finnish WGS reference panel we saw a ~100% increase in the number of well im puted exonic variants in 0.1 0.5% allele frequency range compared to the 1000G panel. The HRC reference panel gave us 7% more variants compared to the Finnish WGS panel but also introduced 0.8% false positive variant calls compared to 0.1% with the Finnish WGS reference panel mostly driven by rare variants with allele frequency <0.1%. By combining the WES panel with the population specific WGS reference panel, we observed over 20% more well imputed variants in the 0.1 0.5% allele frequency range compa red to the Finnish WGS only panel. As an example, we successfully imputed 422 loss of function (LoF) variants enriched in the Finnish population into the test dataset.

Here we explore sub continental ancestry using ~700,000 autosomal SNPs in a sample of ~7,000 Latin Americans from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru (DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004572). We describe a novel statistical approach exploiting patterns of haplotype similarity with increased precision over a related approach that was ap plied successfully to study the fine scale patterns of worldwide populati ons (DOI:10.1126/science.1243518) and Great Britain (DOI:10.1038/nature14230). We identify the contributions of geographically precise ancestral components, including those from Africa and Europe, to both re gions and individuals. For Brazil, we highlight how the sources of European ancestry vary considerably, reflecting influx at different times from the Ibe rian Peninsula, Italy and Northern Europe. In the former Spanish colonies, we identify ancestry from specific regions in Spain at the individual level. Strikingly, Native American ancestry within Latin Americans shows a strong correlation with DNA patterns of specific local Native groups. We demon strate that genetic patterns among these Native groups, as well as among different migrant groups, are clearly differentiated, which has important implications in understanding how genetic associations to phenotypes vary across Latin Americans with widely heterogeneous ancestral backgrounds. Overall, we are able to identify ancestry patterns at higher resolution than has been previously achieved, allowing us a fine grained analysis of how history shaped the genetic makeup of Latin America and how this affects association studies.

25043,"Mitochondrial disorders are both clinically and genetically diverse since de fective expression of mitochondrial (mt)DNA can be caused by mitochondri al or nuclear gene mutations. Recently, several novel genes encoding factors involved in mt tRNA processing have been identified as important causes of mitochondrial disease. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified muta tions in the TRMT10C gene (encoding the mitochondrial protein MRPP1), in two unrelated individuals who presented at birth with elevated CSF and serum lactate levels, hypotonia and deafness. Together, MRPP1, MRPP2 and MRPP3 form the mitochondrial ribonuclease P (mt RNase P) protein that is responsible for cleaving the 5Ã¢ÂÂ end of mt tRNAs from polycistronic pre cursor RNA molecules. Additionally, a stable complex of MRPP1 and MRPP2 has m 1R9 methyltransferase activity which methylates mt tRNAs at positi on 9, a vital modification required for folding mt tRNAs into their correct tertiary structures. Analysis of subject fibroblasts harboring TRMT10C mis sense variants revealed decreased protein levels of MRPP1 and defective mitochondrial protein synthesis. Cell lines from affected individuals showed an increase in mt RNA precursors indicative of defective mt RNA proces sing. The pathogenicity of the detected variants compound heterozygous p.(Arg181Leu) and p.(Thr272Ala) changes in subject 1, a homozygous p.(Arg181Leu) variant in subject 2 was confirmed by the functional rescue of associated OXPHOS and mt RNA processing defects following lentiviral transduction of wild type TRMT10C.

Whole exome sequencing of the family revealed compounding mutations in PPA2, a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein most commonly associated with complex V in the oxidative phosphorylati on respiratory chain. A further three unrelated pedigrees with six acutely affected neonatal individuals were recently identified with homozygous and compound heterozygous PPA2 mutations, resulting in much more severe symptoms including seizures, lactic acidosis and cardiac arrhythmia leading to death within days or months of birth. Comparison of fibroblast mitochon dria from normal and mutated PPA2 individuals showed the activity of in organic pyrophosphatase was significantly reduced in affected individuals. Recombinant PPA2 enzymes modelling hypomorphic missense mutations exhibit decreased activity that correlated with disease severity.

25045," Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) occurs in apparently healthy infants and remains unexplained despite thorough investigation including complete autopsy. The vast majority of cases are sporadic. We investigated two families with recurrence of SUDI in 4/5 and 2/2 siblings between 4 and 20 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of two affected cases in family 1 and one in family 2 revealed compound heterozygous missense variati ons in the PPA2 gene, encoding mitochondrial pyrophosphatase inorganic 2. This protein is thought to catalyze hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophospha te, the homeostasis of which is exceedingly important for the cell. The four missense variations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated according to autosomal recessive inheritance in both families. PPA2 protein levels were decreased in the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ fibroblasts compared to controls. We show that yeast cells lacking the orthologous gene (ppa2ÃÂ) are not viable due to the loss of mitochondria and are rescued by the human PPA2 gene but not when it carries the mutations found in patients. Using a regula table (doxycycline repressible) gene expression system we show that the primary consequences of the pathogenic ppa2 mutations are a decreased rate of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis and a drop in the electrical mitochondrial membrane potential. Altogether these data demonstrate that PPA2 is an essential gene in yeast and that biallelic mutations in PPA2 cause a novel mitochondrial disease associated with sudden death in infants.",2016
25046," Isolated complex I deficiency is the most common biochemical phenotype observed in patients with mitochondrial disease, and with an estimated 1300 proteins in the mitoproteome it is often associated with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies including custom, targeted gene panels or unbiased whole exome sequenc ing (WES) are hugely powerful in identifying the underlying genetic defect in a clinical diagnostic setting, yet a significant proportion of patients still lack a genetic diagnosis. These patients may harbour mutations in poorly understood or uncharacterised genes, and their diagnosis relies upon char acterisation of these orphan genes. Complexome profiling has recently iden tified TMEM126B as a component of the mitochondrial complex I assem bly (MCIA) complex alongside the ACAD9, ECSIT , NDUFAF1 and TIMMDC1 proteins. We describe the clinical, biochemical and molecular findings in six cases of TMEM126B related mitochondrial disease from four unrelated families. We provide functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of these TMEM126B variants and unequivocally establish this gene as a cause of complex I deficiency in association with either a severe multisystem pre sentation in infancy or pure myopathy in later adulthood. Functional experi mentation including lentiviral rescue and complexome profiling of subject cell lines establishes TMEM126B as the tenth complex I assembly factor associated with human disease and validates the importance of proteomic approaches in characterising novel disease genes whose physiological roles were previously undetermined.",2016
25047,"Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States, 6Division of Pediatric Neurology, University ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital, Zurich, ZÃÂ¼rich, Switzerland. Hereditary cerebellar ataxias are heterogeneous disorders characterized by gait disturbances, often accompanied by additional neurological symptoms and involvement of other organs. Here, we report on three human individu als from two unrelated families, who presented with recurrent episodes of acute liver failure in early infancy, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar vermis atrophy, and ataxia. By whole exome sequencing, we identified compound heterozygous mutations within the SCYL1 gene in all affected individuals. All mutations identified were predictably disruptive, causing loss of SCYL1 at the protein level. Despite clear parallels in clinical phenotypes between a Scyl1 deficient mouse model and human patients, recurrent hepatic fai lure represents a non neurological clinical manifestation that has not been anticipated from the mouse study. SCYL1 belongs to the evolutionarily high ly conserved SCY1 like family of catalytically inactive protein kinases and plays an important constituent of the coatomer (COPI) coated vesicles me diated membrane trafficking machinery. We showed that in SCYL1 deficient human fibroblasts the Golgi apparatus is massively enlarged, substantiating the notion that SCYL1 maintains Golgi morphology by interacting with se veral key components of COPI coats. Intriguingly, SCYL1 shares a functional role in retrograde Golgi transport with the NBAS gene, which was recently implicated in a syndromic as well as a non syndromic form of recurrent episodes of infantile liver failure, which suggests a common pathogenetic underpinning. Our study demonstrates that the discovery of human disease related ge nes can be accelerated by studying naturally occurring mouse mutants and further argues for an unbiased genome wide strategy in the molecular dia gnosis of patients with rare inherited disorders.

25048,"Ocular developmental anomalies (ODA) including Anophthalmia/Micro phthalmia (AM) have an estimated combined prevalence of 3.7 in 10,000 births. Mutations in SOX2 are the most frequent contributors to severe ODA, yet account for a minority of the genetic drivers. To identify novel ODA loci, we conducted targeted high throughput sequencing of 407 candidate genes in an initial cohort of 22 sporadic ODA patients. Patched 1 (PTCH1), an inhi bitor of sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, harbored an enrichment of rare heterozygous variants in comparison to either controls, or to the other candidate genes; targeted resequencing of PTCH1 in a second cohort of 48 ODA patients identified two additional rare nonsynonymous changes. Using multiple transient models and a CRISPR/Cas9 mutant, we show physiologi cally relevant phenotypes altering SHH signaling and eye development upon abrogation of ptch1 in zebrafish for which in vivo complementation assays using these models showed that all six patient missense mutations affect SHH signaling. Finally, through transcriptomic and ChIP analyses, we show that SOX2 binds to an intronic domain of the PTCH1 locus to regulate PTCH1 expression, findings that were validated both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that PTCH1 mutations contribute to as much as 10% of ODA, identify the SHH signaling pathway as a novel effector of SOX2 activity during human ocular development, and indicate that ODA is likely the result of overactive SHH signaling in humans harboring mutations in eit her PTCH1 or SOX2.",2016

In additional families, we identified two other mutations within the highly conserved proximal promoter sequence (c. 274T>G and c. 307T>C) by direct sequencing of the OVOL2 promoter. OVOL2 is a transcription factor and a direct transcriptional repressor of the established PPCD associated gene ZEB1. Both transcription factors regu late mesenchymal to epithelial transition.

Unlike the more common dominant and sporadic forms of aniridia, there has been no significant association with PAX6 mutations in individuals with GS and the mode of inheritance of the disease had long been regarded as uncertain. The aim of the present study was to characteri ze the molecular bases of GS. Materiel and Methods. We used a combination of trio based whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing in five simplex GS families. Functional analysis of the identified mutations was assessed in cell models. Results and conclusions. We found homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating mutations and de novo heterozygous mutations in a unique gene supporting the genetic homogeneity of this rare disease. The gene encodes a protein involved in calcium homeostasis. Expression in a heterologous cell system of the truncation mutants and of the missense mutants alone or in combination with the wildtype counterpart supported that both loss of function and dominant negative mutations cause Gillespie syndrome ending the long debate regarding the transmission of this rare syndrome.",2016

Here, we aimed to in vestigate the contribution of RCBTB1 in IRD and to assess the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. Whole exome sequencing data of over 1000 IRD patients were inspected for RCBTB1 mutations, and targeted next generation sequencing of the co ding region of RCBTB1 was performed in 280 IRD patients. In six families with isolated and syndromic IRD five distinct homozygous missense vari ants were found. All changes segregate with disease, affect highly conserved amino acids and are predicted to be deleterious. A Mediterranean founder haplotype was identified for mutation c.919G>A, p.(Val307Met), occurring in two families of Italian and Greek origin, respectively. Ocular phenotypes range from typical RP starting in the second decade to chorioretinal dystro phy with a later age of onset. RCBTB1 mRNA expression was demonstrated in human retina and RPE, and protein immunostaining was observed mainly in the inner retina. As RCBTB1 has previously been identified as a Cullin3 substrate adaptor, different components of the Cullin3 and Nrf2 pathway were quantified. This revealed a decreased mRNA expression of Nrf2 and five Nrf2 target genes. In conclusion, hypomorphic RCBTB1 missense mutations were identified in families with non syndromic and syndromic IRD respectively, putting forward RCBTB1 as a new IRD disease gene.

Methods: Extensive pre screening using next generation sequencing of known genes on over 1000 inherited retinal disease families led to a cohort likely enriched for novel genes for further whole exome/genome sequen cing. An integrated database server was developed based on the ExAC and Phenotips software to query genes and phenotypes (using human pheno type ontology (HPO)) in the pool of families. Results: To date, 84 families have undergone analysis (76 exome, 8 geno me). In 13 probands, likely disease causing mutations in known genes were revealed. Amongst these, specific alleles of ceroid lipofuscinosis 7 (CLN7/MFSD8 ) were consistently associated with a non syndromic retinal degene ration. Three genes, previously unreported in human retinal disease, have been discovered. These include GNB3 mutated homozygously (c.124C>T ; p. Arg42Ter) in a patient with a distinct stationary retinal dysfunction. 102 exomes of probands with inherited retinal dystrophy (from UCLEx) with detailed phenotypic data have been integrated into a computer searchable framework.

ORG 44Back to index Purpose: Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are clinically and genetically very heterogeneous, as ~125 genes have been associated with non syndromic IRDs. The purpose of this study was to develop a flexible, comprehensive and cost effective sequencing procedure for IRDs. Methods: About 4,000 probands with non syndromic IRDs were ascertai ned by partners of the European Retinal Disease Consortium (ERDC). In total, 6,200 molecular inversion probes (MIPs) were designed to capture ~1,600 protein coding exons and flanking intronic sequences of 108 IRD associated genes. The captured targets were sequenced on a NextSeq500 Illumina sequencer and the data were analyzed using an in house pipeline to find the causal genetic variants. Results: In pools of 120 samples the average coverage per probe was ~500X, where 95% of the probes were covered >10X. Analysis was completed for 2,500/4,000 samples. Sanger validation was performed for a representative set of variants identified in 290 probands from Nijmegen. We have identified the causal variants in 59% (172/290) of the cases, which included a number of plausible de novo variants and several novel genotype phenotype corre lations. Material costs for sequencing 108 IRD genes was Ã¢ÂÂ¬65 per sample, rendering it very cost effective. Conclusions: Taken into consideration that the Nijmegen cohort was pre viously prescreened using various genotyping methods, the corrected yield would be ~71%. At 1/10th of WES cost, this efficiency is equal or superior to other published gene panel (36 62%) or WES based (49 66%) sequence analysis.

We identified over 90 genes in which damaging de novo mutations show geno me wide significant (p < 1e 6) evidence for causing developmental disor ders, including 15 novel genes reaching this level for the first time. We also identified a novel seizure disorder associated with truncating mutations in SMC1A, a gene in which missense mutations are known to cause a different disorder. We estimated that we have statistical power to detect ~50% of all haploinsufficient genes, and that most haploinsufficient genes causing DDs have already been discovered. Our large number of genome wide significant findings allow us to compare empirically the power to detect novel DD as sociated genes using exome or genome sequencing. We find that, at current cost differentials, exome sequencing has much greater power for novel gene discovery for genetically heterogeneous disorders. Finally, we estimate that ~45% of our cohort likely carry pathogenic de novo mutations in coding sequences, with approximately half operating by a loss of function mecha nism, and the remainder being gain of function or dominant negative in ac tion.

Here we utilize this dataset to identify novel genetic causes of ID. Methods: Based on gene specific mutation rates we performed a statistical analysis to detect genes that are significantly enriched for loss of function or functional de novo mutations. To achieve the best possible power to iden tify novel candidate ID genes, we added data from previously published exo me sequencing trio studies giving rise to a combined cohort of 2,104 trios. Results: In our cohort of 820 ID patients we identified 4 novel genes signi ficantly enriched for functional or loss of function de novo mutations. We reproduce these results in the combined ID set of 2,104 trios and identify 6 further novel genes enriched for de novo mutations. In addition, we show that similar to known ID genes, these 10 candidate genes are highly intole rant to normal variation. A phenotype comparison of patients with de novo mutations in the same gene provides further support for a shared genetic cause. Conclusions: In summary, we identified 10 novel candidate ID genes by performing a meta analysis on WES data of 2,104 ID trios, highlighting the potential of unbiased statistical analyses of large trio based sequencing stu dies to identify novel candidate genes.",2016

Most affected persons showed additional symptoms including muscular hypotonia, epilepsy, and microcephaly. We identified relevant variants in 114 (76%) of families. Among these, 53 are meanwhile confirmed genes and likely clarify the cause of ARID in the corresponding families while in 60 the homozygous variant is located in a candidate gene. Despite the high hetero geneity we found variants in two unrelated families for four already descri bed genes, AHI1 , GPR56, PRRT2, and PLA2G6 . At least one patient has two distinct phenotypes because of two homozygous variants in different genes.

Until now, we have shown a dele terious effect for 12 variants in 10 genes (FAR1 , PGAP1 , PGAP2 , EZR, EDC3 , PTEN, TAF13 , FRRS1L , ZIP8, KIAA0586 ). In order to prove the causality of the candidate variants, identifying further likely pathogenic variants in similar ly affected individuals is necessary. Therefore we initiated a Consortium of Autosomal Recessive Intellectual Disability (CARID) to share data which al lowed identification of additional independent cases for 12 candidate genes, so far.

Therefore, to better investigate this hypothesis, taking advantage of the breakthrough genetic reprogram ming technology, we investigated morphological and RNA seq transcripto me changes on iPSC derived neurons from several patients for each disease related gene.

Non syndromic Intellectual disability (ID) and Coffin Siris syndrome (CSS) are associated with loss of function mutations in various components of the BAF complex, such as ARID1B, which is expressed in the human brain and in mammalian embryonic stem cells. To understand how mutated ARID1B affects human brain development and leads to develop mental delay phenotypes, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA seq) analysis in fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes from ID indivi duals harboring ARID1B mutations and control subjects. Pathway analysis of 452 genes showing prominent transcriptional changes between affected and control subjects indicated deregulation in cell movement related pro cesses, especially of embryonic stem cells. In ID individuals, qRT PCR ex pression analysis confirmed downregulation of two key regulators of actin organization and inducers of cell migration, Rho associated protein kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2. Using models for cell migration we found that siRNA mediated knockdown of ARID1B strongly reduced cell migration and led to downregulation of both ROCK1 and ROCK2. In addition to ROCK1/ROCK2, in both neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma cells, ARID1B knockdown led to downregulation of NCK1, an important mediator of activated receptor tyro sine kinase signaling that reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and promotes cell polarization and directional migration via pseudopodia formation. Our results indicate that ARID1B can regulate cell migration and raise the pos sibility that compromised cell migration due to ARID1B mutations could be implicated in ARID1B associated ID syndromes.

RDEB is caused by biallelic null mutations in COL7A1 , resulting in a complete absence of type VII collagen (ColVII). There is no cure for RDEB. Since 91% of COL7A1 exons are in frame and encode repetitive amino acid stretches, and low levels of ColVII already drastically improve the phe notype, COL7A1 seems a perfect candidate for antisense oligonucleotide (AON) mediated exon skipping therapy. Materials and Methods: We examined the feasibility of AON mediated exon skipping in vitro in primary cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and in vivo in a human skin graft mouse model after systemic delivery. The func tionality of the resulting protein was assessed in diverse in vitro and in vivo functional assays. Results: Treatment with AONs designed against a mutant exon 105 led to in frame exon 105 skipping at the RNA level and restored ColVII expression in vitro. Moreover, systemic administration of these AONs to nude mice in duced in vivo re expression of ColVII in skin grafts, generated from mutant patient cells, engrafted on the miceÃ¢ÂÂs back. Additionally, the resulting ColVII proved functional in vitro in trypsin digestion, type IV collagen binding and fibroblast migration assays, and in vivo in a ColVII deficient mouse model.

The disease phenotype comprises characteristic circumferential skin creases accompanied by intellectual disability, cleft palate, a short stature and dysmorphic features. Here we report that mutations in either MAPRE2 or TUBB underlie the genetic ori gin of this syndrome. MAPRE2 encodes a member of the microtubule end binding family of proteins that bind to the GTP cap at growing microtubule plus ends, while TUBB encodes a beta tubulin isotype that is expressed ab undantly in the developing brain. Functional analyses of the TUBB mutants show multiple defects in the chaperone dependent tubulin heterodimer folding and assembly pathway that leads to a compromised yield of nati ve heterodimers. The TUBB mutations also have an impact on microtubule dynamics in vivo. For MAPRE2, we show that the mutations result in enhan ced MAPRE2 binding to microtubules, implying an increased dwell time at microtubule plus ends. Further, in vivo analysis of MAPRE2 mutations in a zebrafish model of craniofacial development show that the variants likely perturb the patterning of branchial arches, either through excessive activity (under a recessive paradigm) or through haploinsufficiency (dominant de novo paradigm).

KWE was previously mapped to 8p23 p22 (KWE critical region) in South African families, who are expected to share the same mutation due to a founder effect. Using targeted resequencing of the KWE critical region in three South African families and SNP array/whole genome sequencing in two Norwegian families, we identified two overlap ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 48Back to index ping tandem duplications of 7.67 kb and a 15.93 kb respectively. The dupli cations are located upstream to the CTSB gene, and the 2.63 kb overlapping region includes an enhancer element that is active in keratinocytes . Based on NHEK cell line Hi C data and MCF 7 cell line CTCF ChIA PET data, three potential topological domains were revealed, all containing the enhancer and CTSB, plus either FDFT1 and even NEIL2. However, the activity of the enhancer correlated with CTSB but not with FDFT1 and NEIL2 gene expres sion in differentiating keratinocytes and other cell lines, and MCF 7 RNAPII ChIA PET data showed that the enhancer interacts with the CTSB promoter but not with the FDFT1 or NEIL2 promoters, suggesting that the enhancer normally regulates CTSB expression. In conclusion, we show that KWE in South African and Norwegian families is caused by tandem duplications in non coding DNA containing an active enhancer element for CTSB. Duplica tion of this region may cause aberrant expression of nearby genes due to changes in the topological domain structure, in response to environmental triggers. C22 Cardiovascular disorder",2016
25069,"Background: Genetic determinants of stroke, the leading neurological cause of death and disability, are poorly understood and have seldom been explo red in the general population. Methods: We performed a genome wide screen for common genetic va riants associated with incident stroke risk in 18 prospective population based cohorts comprising 84,961 participants, of whom 4,348 experienced stroke. We followed up variants with p<5ÃÂ10 6 in the largest available cross sectional studies (70,804 participants of whom 19,816 experienced stroke). For genome wide significant findings (p<5ÃÂ10 8), we explored associations with additional cerebrovascular phenotypes and undertook functional ana lyses in mouse and zebrafish mutants. Results: We replicated seven of eight known loci for ischemic stroke and identified a novel locus at chr6p25 (rs12204590, near FOXF2) associated with risk of all stroke: odds ratio (OR) ,1ÃÂ·08 (95%CI:1ÃÂ·05 1ÃÂ·12), p,1ÃÂ·48ÃÂ10 8 (minor allele frequency 21%). The rs12204590 stroke risk allele also in creased MRI defined white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, a marker of cerebral small artery disease, in stroke free adults (N,21,079; p,0ÃÂ·0025). Consistently, young patients with segmental deletions of FOXF2 exhibited extensive WMH burden. Conditional (inducible) deletion of Foxf2 in adult mice resulted in cerebral infarction, reactive gliosis, and microhemorrha ge. The zebrafish equivalents of FOXF2 (orthologs) foxf2b/foxf2a were ex pressed in brain pericytes and mutant foxf2b / cerebral vessels showed decreased smooth muscle cell and pericyte coverage. Conclusion: In our study of 155,765 persons in total (24,164 with stroke), we identified common variants near FOXF2 associated with increased stro ke susceptibility. Extensive epidemiological and experimental data suggest that FOXF2 mediates this association, potentially via differentiation defects of cerebral vascular mural cells.",2016
25070,"Paediatric cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders cha racterized by structural and functional cardiac abnormalities. Up to 40% of affected children die or undergo cardiac transplantation within five years of diagnosis. While understanding the molecular basis of paediatric cardio myopathy has greatly improved over the last decades, in many cases the underlying cause remains unknown. Currently available (targeted/custom based) diagnostic tests do not represent the whole spectrum of genetic etio logies and lead to a genetic diagnosis in a subset of paediatric patients only. Using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in two consanguineous families with idiopathic paediatric cardiomyopathy, we identified homozy gous truncating mutations in a new disease gene: alpha kinase 3 (ALPK3). This gene encodes a nuclear kinase essential for early differentiation of car diomyocytes, being involved in important transcription factor pathways. A third family carrying mutated ALPK3 was identified upon cohort screening. Patients with biallelic mutations presented with severe cardiomyopathy leading to early lethality or biventricular dysfunction in childhood. Some heterozygous family members showed adult onset cardiomyopathy with atypically distributed hypertrophy, indicating that this gene may also play a role in dominantly inherited cardiomyopathies. We provide microscopic evidence of intercalated disc remodelling, as previously observed in Alpk3 knockout mice. Further functional experiments and studies on the role of the gene in adult onset cardiomyopathies and cardiac hypertrophy are on going. In conclusion, biallelic truncating mutations in ALPK3 cause severe paedia tric cardiomyopathy. Our findings highlight the importance of transcription factor pathways in the molecular mechanisms underlying human cardio myopathies and underscore the high genetic heterogeneity of paediatric cardiomyopathies.",2016

De novo prote in truncating variants have been shown to be enriched among the 10% of Ã¢ÂÂsyndromicÃ¢ÂÂ patients with extra cardiac manifestations (Homsy et al., 2015). However, these findings do not explain the recurrence risk in the majori ty (~90%) of CHD cases which present themselves clinically as isolated cardiac defects. We exome sequenced 4,593 individuals from 1,823 CHD families (1,365 trios, 32 multi sibling families and 458 singletons), inclu ding both syndromic (n,610) and non syndromic cases (n,1,281). In the syndromic CHD cohort, we confirmed a significant enrichment of de novo, but not inherited, protein truncating variants, in known CHD associated genes, consistent with recent findings. Conversely, in non syndromic CHD we observed significant enrichment of protein truncating variants inherited from unaffected parents in known CHD genes. These findings point towards a role for variants with reduced penetrance in these non syndromic cases. Additionally, we identified three novel genome wide significant syndromic CHD disorders caused by de novo mutations in CHD4, CDK13 and PRKD1.

25072,"Aneurysm osteoarthritis syndrome (AOS, or Loeys Dietz syndrome type3, LDS3) is characterized by aortic aneurysms and early onset osteoarthritis, caused by SMAD3 mutations. Smad3 is part of the Smad2/3/4 transcripti on factor, essential for TGF ÃÂ² activated transcription. Although mutations in TGF ÃÂ² related genes result in aneurysm formation, the underlying mecha nism is unknown. Here, we examined aneurysm formation and progression in Smad3 / animals. Smad3 / animals developed aortic aneurysms rapidly, resulting in prematu re death, earlier in males than females. Aortic wall immunohistochemistry showed no increase in extracellular matrix and collagen, nor loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) but instead revealed medial elastin disruption and adventitial inflammation. Remarkably, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) were not activated in VSMCs, but were specifically activated in inflammato ry areas. Although Smad3 / aortas showed increased nuclear pSmad2 and pErk, indicative of TGF ÃÂ² receptor activation, downstream TGF ÃÂ² activated genes were not upregulated. Increased pSmad2 and pErk staining in pre aneurysmal Smad3 / aortas without immune infiltrates implied that the aortic damage and subsequent TGF ÃÂ² receptor activated signaling precede aortic inflammation. Finally, increased pErk together with impaired down stream TGF ÃÂ² activated transcription resulted in increased Smad3 / VSMC proliferation. Smad3 / animals recapitulate the aortic phenotype observed in patients with SMAD3 mutations. Smad3 deficiency leads to imbalanced activation of downstream genes and no activation of MMPs in VSMCs, causing an immu ne response resulting in rapid dilatation and rupture of the aortic wall. Our findings uncover new possibilities for treatment of patients carrying SMAD3 mutations; instead of treating with drugs targeting the TGF ÃÂ² pathway, they may benefit more from immune suppression.

25073,"Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner but rare X linked families have been descri bed. So far, FLNA is the only X linked gene associated with a syndromic form of TAAD, namely the periventricular nodular heterotopia type of Ehlers Danlos syndrome. However, FLNA only explains a small number of the X linked TAAD families. We performed targeted resequencing of nearly 500 extracellular matrix and TGFÃÂ² related genes in a cohort of 11 Marfan like probands without known causal mutation. We identified two patients with loss of function mutations in BGN, encoding the extracellular matrix small leucine rich proteoglycan biglycan. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of BGN in 400 male and 200 fema le TAAD patients, negative for known TAAD genes, identified a splice site mutation in a male proband and suggested a deletion in two other male probands. The latter were confirmed by micro array analysis. The clinical phenotype is characterized by early onset aortic aneurysm (age 1 year) and dissection (age 15 years). Other recurrent findings include hypertelorism, pectus deformity, joint hypermobility, contractures and mild skeletal dys plasia. Histological stainings of the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ aortic wall revealed a substan tial reduction in collagen content, while elastin fibers appeared normal. Bi glycan deficiency in male BALB/cA mice leads to sudden death from aortic rupture, indicating that biglycan is both structurally and functionally essen tial for the integrity of the aortic wall. These results confirm that BGN gene defects in human cause an X linked syndromic form of severe TAAD. C23 Functional Genomic",2016
25074,"Introduction: Life expectancy of men is about 5 years shorter compared with women but the underlying factor(s) have been elusive. Our previous results show that mosaic loss of chromosome Y in blood cells (LOY) is asso ciated with age, smoking, all cause mortality and non hematological tumors (Nat. Genet. 2014 PMID:24777449, Science 2015 PMID:25477213). The aim of the preset study was to test if men with LOY are more susceptible to AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD).Materials and Methods: LOY in blood cells was estimated using SNP array data from >3200 men from one AD case control study and two prospective cohorts. Whole genome sequencing was used for validations. A set of stati stical techniques were used to evaluate association between LOY in blood and AD diagnosis. Results: LOY was detected in ~17% of participants (median age,73, ran ge,37 96). We found that men with AD diagnosis had a higher degree of LOY mosaicism in the case control study (adjusted odds ratio,2.80, AD events,606, p,0.0184). Furthermore, analysis of the two prospective co horts showed that men with LOY in blood at sampling had an increased risk for incident AD during follow up time (HR,6.80, 95% CI,2.16 21.43, AD events,140, p,0.0011).Conclusions: Our results suggest that LOY in blood cells is associated with increased risk for both AD and cancer, suggesting a role of LOY in blood cells on disease processes in other tissues, possibly via defective immunosurveil lance functions of immune cells without the Y chromosome. Hence, as a ma le specific genetic risk factor, LOY might help explain why males on average live shorter than females. ABSTRACTS CONCURRENT SESSIONS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25075,"Trisomy 21(T21), is a model disorder of altered gene expression. We have previously used a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21 to study the global dysregulation of gene expression,eliminating genetic variation among individuals(Nature:508;345 350;2014). Majority of previous stu dies on aneuploidies were conducted ÃÂ¿n cell populations or tissues. Studies on gene and allelic expression of single cells(SC) may reveal important biological insights regarding the cellular impact of aneuploidy elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of gene dosage. We estimated the allele specific expression(ASE) from RNAseq of ~1000 single cells in different aneuploidies:352 SC fibroblasts (172 Normal 179 T21 cells) from the pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21, 166 from a mosaic T21, 176 mosaic T18, 151 mosaic T8, and 146 SC fibroblasts from mosaic T13.In the monozygotic twins,considerable number of heterozygous sites genomewi de were expressed monoallelically(Normal:73.5% 564,668 observations, and T21:78.7% 549,799 observations). There was considerable monoal lelic expression for chr21 sites in Normal and,surprisingly, in T21 cells as well(Normal:63,3% 5,009 observations,T21:72.8% 6,456 observations). We classified chr21 genes in three classes according to the level of the aggre gate monoallelic expression of their corresponding sites (9 monoallelic,29 intermediate,2 biallelic). We hypothesize that each class of genes contribu tes in a specific way to the phenotypic variability of Down Syndrome(DS).Similar results,(i.e. extensive monoallelic expression of genes on the super numerary chromosomes,were also observed in the other aneuploidies. Our analysis demonstrated that,for genes with monoallelic expression,the alte red gene dosage induced by the aneuploid chromosome is due to the num ber of cells expressing the gene on the supernumerary chromosome. This difference in the fraction of expressing cells could contribute to the deve lopment and variability of phenotypes in aneuploidies. This study provides a new fundamental understanding of gene dosage effects in aneuploidies.",2016
25076,"Recent advances in genomic techniques have generated an increasing inte rest in structural variants (SVs). However, there is still limited data on their functional impact. This is particularly true for inversions, in which their ba lanced nature and the complex repetitive regions where they appear make their study especially challenging. In this regard, we have designed a null model to elucidate the functional characteristics of these variants, taking as reference the most reliable set of human polymorphic inversions so far from the InvFEST database. Human inversions show the signature of natural selection, avoiding more often than expected not only genes, but also other functional elements such as enhancers, chromatin domain boundaries and highly conserved regions. Moreover, we measured the effect of 45 experi mentally genotyped polymorphic inversions on gene expression based on the transcriptome data from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 175 individuals from the Geuvadis project. Using a combination of well established tools and further filtering criteria to minimize false positives, we found that alt hough the majority of inversions do not appear to have any significant regu latory effect in this cell type, around half a dozen of them have a clear influ ence on specific genes, both in cis and in trans. Finally, we intersected SNPs reported as GWAS hits of different human phenotypes with the inversions in our dataset. All together, these results illustrate the potential impact of inversions on the human genome, and contribute to shed light on the mole cular mechanisms responsible for phenotypic variability.

Lower confidence transcribed loci, i.e. not supported by ENCODE or GTex RNA seq data, were systematically experimentally evaluated in 8 tissues by RT PCR amplification followed by highly multiplexed sequencing readout, a method we coined RT PCR seq. 78% of all assessed junctions are confirmed by this evaluation procedure demonstrating the high quality of the annota tion reached by the GENCODE gene set. In a second phase unvalidated junc tions were reevaluated by RT PCR seq in a second set of 8 tissues and with a novel pair of primers to account for tissue specificity and bad design of the oligos, respectively.

Mutations in the CRLF1 gene are implicated in CS/CISS1. A subset of CS/CISS1 cases remains yet genetically unexplained after CRLF1 sequencing. Materials and Methods: To identify new gene(s) implicated in the clinical phenotype, we used a whole exome sequencing approach followed by tar geted Sanger sequencing. Results: We identified homozygous mutations in the KLHL7 gene in five ca ses. KLHL7 encodes a BTB Kelch related protein involved in the ubiquitina tion of target proteins for proteasome mediated degradation. Mono allelic mutations in KLHL7 have been reported in three cases affected by a late onset form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. A critical evaluati on of the retinal phenotype in our probands revealed retinitis pigmentosa, so implying that KLHL7 mutations could show greater severity in recessive than in dominant cases. Conclusions: Although these data further support the pathogenic role of bi allelic KLHL7 mutations in a CS/CISS1 like phenotype, they do not explain all their clinical manifestations and highlight the high phenotypic hetero geneity associated to mutations in KLHL7. Uncovering whether KLHL7 and CRLF1 converge functionally can have important implications in the search for novel disease associated genes and pharmacological targets.

We previously reported an autosomal recessive form of such a disorder, intraosseus vascular malformation (VMOS) [MIM 606893], characterized by severe progressive life threatening craniofacial vascular malformations and supraumbilical raphe. Homozygosity mapping and massively parallel sequencing identified mutations in ELMO2, which conveys extracellular signals to cytoskeleton, in five unrelated families with eight affected individuals with VMOS. These include two splice site mutati ons, a one nucleotide deletion causing frameshift, and a complex rearran gement deleting the first exon. VMOS lesions had bones with abnormally expanded and malformed blood vessels lacking mature vascular smooth muscle layer. ELMO2 deficient cells had a significant downregulation of the associated partner DOCK1, resulting in deficient activation of RAC1 a key factor in controlling cell migration. Primary fibroblasts from an individual with VMOS had impaired cell migration, an essential process during angio genesis, which was rescued by external ELMO2 protein. Comparative phy logenetic analysis points out that Elmo2 first appeared with the divergence of jawed vertebrates from others, and might have acquired new functions in jawed vertebrates. Taken together, our study places ELMO2 in a critical position for maintenance of vascular stability in bone tissue, and sheds new light on the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying angio genesis in intramembranous ossification.

25087,"AIM: To examine whether raising the confidence threshold at which the al gorithm for a SNP based NIPT for the 22q11.2 microdeletion makes a posi tive call would increase the positive predictive value (PPV) without affecting test sensitivity. METHODS: 20,776 NIPT samples received between Feb Aug, 2014 were pre viously evaluated for the 22q11.2 deletion using primers targeting 672 SNPs in a 2.9 Mb segment of 22q11.2, and analyzed using a high risk confidence threshold of 0.90. Follow up information, including ultrasound findings, were collected for high risk cases. Here, the algorithmÃ¢ÂÂs confidence thresh old was raised to 0.95, and PPV recalculated for the entire cohort and for the subset of cases with prior known directly associated ultrasound anomalies (high a priori risk) and with no prior known anomalies (low a priori risk). RESULTS: At the original confidence cut off, the test had a PPV of 18%, which increased to 42.3% upon reflex sequencing of high risk samples at a higher read depth (HDOR). Raising the algorithmÃ¢ÂÂs confidence level increased the PPV to 52.4% and reduced the false positive rate from 0.12% to 0.07%, with no loss in test sensitivity. The PPV was 100% for high a priori risk cases, and 20% for low a priori risk cases. CONCLUSIONS: The updated methodology (raised confidence level + re flexing) eliminated 80% of the FP cases originally reported, yielding an improved PPV for this SNP based NIPT (52.4% vs. 18%). Given the higher than previously reported incidence of the 22q11.2 microdeletion and the benefits of early intervention, we expect this improved test to be highly ben eficial in prenatal testing.",2016

We aimed to study 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5 methylcytosi ne (5mC) patterns in human spermatogenic cells. Samples were obtained by testicular biopsy of 15 patients diagnosed with azoospermia. Chromo some and nuclei preparations were made by Ã¢ÂÂdirectÃ¢ÂÂ technique using hy potonic (0.9% sodium citrate) and colchicines treatment and fixation with methanol:acetic acid, 3:1. Using indirect immunofluorescence, we have ana lyzed the localization of 5hmC and its co distribution with 5mC in the nuclei and chromosomes from spermatogenic cells. To visualize nuclei and to iden tify chromosomes, we used QFH/AcD staining. To determine nucleus ploidy, we used FISH with two centromeric DNA probes.5mC was detected in all nuclei from both diploid and haploid cells and in all chromosomes from both mitotic spermatogonia and meiotic spermato cytes. 5hmC showed a different pattern: it was present only in some nuclei and was totally absent in mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. By comparing hydroxymethylation and FISH patterns in 5000 nuclei from each sample, we established that 5hmC was present in 32 52% of diploid nuclei from sper matogonia and Sertoli cells. In contrast, among haploid nuclei from sperma tids, only 0.6 1.9% was hydroxymethylated. Thus, in contrast to 5mC, global 5hmC pattern changes during human sper matogenesis. The presence of 5hmC in a minor set of spermatids suggests active demethylation of their genome. The fate of these hydroxymethylated spermatids during spermiogenesis is to be elucidated in further studies. Supported by RFBR (16 34 00532_mol_a).",2016
25089,"PGT was started in our center in 2012 with FISH diagnostics. In 2015 we be gan applying array comparative genomic hybridization (a CGH) for preim plantation screening and diagnostics. Indications for PGT included: advan ced maternal age (AMA) (>35), repeated implantation failure (>2), balanced chromosome rearrangements. Materials and Methods: We conducted 14 cycles, IVF+ICSI. Patients were di vided into 2 cohorts: 1) young patients (<35) and 2) AMA (>35). Average age was 29,5 ÃÂ±1,4 and 41,2ÃÂ±2,2, respectively. A CGH (Bluegnome, Illumina) was used to detect whole chromosome aneuploidies. Trophectoderm biopsy was performed on 5 6 day of embryo development. Blastocysts were vitrified and transferred in next cycle after PGT . Results: PGT was performed for 48 blastocysts and aneuploidy rates were 53,1% for young patients and 100% for AMA group. The reason for high aneuploidy rate in AMA group is age and small number of blastocysts. Complex chromo some abnormalities were more common in AMA group (Table 1). The most frequent aneuploidies were trisomies (37,5%) and monosomies (35,4%), Aneuploidies for X and Y chromosomes were detected in 8,3%.

25090,"Introduction: The frequency of IVF embryo aneuploidies is estimated to be high and its occurrence is related to maternal and paternal factors. The main factor is female age, however paternal factor could play an important role, mainly in patients with abnormal seminal parameters and chromosomal segregation. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study (from January 2013 to December 2015). For PGSv2.0 trophoectoderm geno me was amplified and aCGH performed using Agilent SurePrintG3 8x60K. The association between variables and male age was evaluated by logistic regression and chi square (SPSSv20.0).Results: The seminal parameters and sperm FISH from 428 patients (from 20 to 53 years old) were evaluated. 31% of the analysed patients had an abnormal sperm FISH. No significant differences were reported for male age and abnormal FISH (p,0.166), however patients older than 50y showed a tendency to higher sperm aneuploidies (50.0% vs 30.5%, p,0.081). To show the effect on embryo aneuploidy we analysed 155 blastocysts from 51 oo cytes from donor cycles where the male partner had a normal sperm FISH in order to evaluate the effect of male age in embryo aneuploidies avoiding the confounding effect of female factor and the abnormal FISH. The embryo aneuploidy rate was 26%. In these cycles no significant difference was re ported between male age and embryo aneuploidy rate (p,0.787) in oocyte donors. Conclusions: Increased paternal age is not associated with sperm and em bryos aneuploidies, therefore aging men do not have increased risk of pro ducing chromosomally abnormal offspring.",2016

There is variable phenotypic expession of the disease, and therefore it is classified into complete (CAIS), partial (PAIS) and mild (MAIS) AIS. Female appearence is characteristic finding for a complete resistance to androgen in an affected person with a male karyotype. Here, we presented four cases with CAIS. Case 1 is a 28 year old infertile woman. Cases 2, 3 and 4 were evaluated due to primary amenorrhea, 17, 16 and 15 years old, respectively.

Materials and Methods: Baltic young male cohort (n,974, 20ÃÂ±2.1 yrs, sperm concentration 81.6ÃÂ±73.0 mln/mL); genotyping of CAG and GGN repeats by fragment analysis PCR; linear regression (CAG and GGN repeat lengths as continuous variables), CAG and GGN trichotomised as short, intermediate, and long (i.e., CAGÃ¢ÂÂ¤21, 22Ã¢ÂÂ¤CAGÃ¢ÂÂ¤24, CAGÃ¢ÂÂ¥25; GGNÃ¢ÂÂ¤22, GGN,23, GGNÃ¢ÂÂ¥24), and treated as categorical variables for Wilcoxon rank sum and Kruskal Wallis tests; tests for nine groups of the combinations of short (s), interme diate (i), and long (l) CAG and GGN repeats (i.e., lCAG sGGN,long CAG short GGN, etc.).Results: The major findings of the study were: (1) Significant difference in serum FSH among the carriers of Ã¢ÂÂlong CAGÃ¢ÂÂ (Ã¢ÂÂ¥24 repeats; median 2.51 IU/L) and Ã¢ÂÂshort CAGÃ¢ÂÂ variants (Ã¢ÂÂ¤21 repeats, 2.92 IU/L; p,0.0007); (2) In dependent associations of Ã¢ÂÂshort CAGÃ¢ÂÂ (71.6 mill/mL) and Ã¢ÂÂshort GGNÃ¢ÂÂ (68.4 mill/mL) stretches with the highest sperm concentration; (3) The lowest sperm concentration (<51.8 mill/mL) among men with the Ã¢ÂÂlong CAGÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂlong GGNÃ¢ÂÂ combination; (4) A synergetic effect of Ã¢ÂÂlong CAGÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂshort GGNÃ¢ÂÂ on reduced total testosterone (18.8 19.1 vrs 25.5 28.6 nmol/L for other variants).Conclusions: Our results demonstrate for the first time that CAG and GGN repeats in the AR gene affect male reproductive parameters in a combina torial way, and may have pharmacogenetic implications in modulating the outcome of hormonal therapy.",2016
25093,"Introduction: Previously we have observed that Ã¢ÂÂlongÃ¢ÂÂ polymorphic CAG re peat sequence (henceforward CAG RS; 23 26x) of the androgene receptor gene (AR) are associated with significantly decreased intrafollicular fluid te stosterone levels, compared to Ã¢ÂÂmedium Ã¢ÂÂ(20 22x) and Ã¢ÂÂshortÃ¢ÂÂ (<20x) CAG RS, as well as with higher conversion of testosterone into estradiol in small antral follicles (PMID: 26404660). The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the CAG RS length on Elonva controlled ovarian hyperstimula tion (COH) in assisted reproduction. Materials and Methods: The prevalence of the three categories of CAG RS Ã¢ÂÂlengthÃ¢ÂÂ was assessed in DNA samples from 48 Ã¢ÂÂlowÃ¢ÂÂ, 191 Ã¢ÂÂintermediateÃ¢ÂÂ and 34 Ã¢ÂÂhighÃ¢ÂÂ responders by Sanger sequencing. Results: A significantly decreased prevalence of Ã¢ÂÂshortÃ¢ÂÂ CAG RS was found in 12.5% of low responders, compared to 30.0% and 32.3% in intermedi ate and high responders, respectively. High responders had significantly in creased proportion of shorter CAG RS and the difference of CAR RS between alleles with low and higher CAG RS repeats on both X chromosomes was significant (p<0.0001) between low and high responders. In addition, high responders with shorter CAG RS were characterized by an association with FSH/receptor gene polymorphisms 29 A/G and p. Asn680Ser, i.e. by an inte grated genotype: AG / AsnAsn. Conclusion. Longer CAG RS are linked to lower response to COH in asso ciation with other FSH R,LH R and LH polymorphisms, including other ge nes sensitive to the AR transactivation potential.

25094," Introduction: Male hypogonadism is a condition in which testicular func tion harms and decreased synthesis of sex hormones and incomplete sperm production occurs. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism(HH) affects the hypo thalamus and/or the pituitary gland, so secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone(GnRH) is absent or insufficient. HH may also result from isolated lack of production or poor biosynthesis of pituitary gonadotropins. Accord ingly, these patients required Gonadotropin treatment by means of admin istration of both FSH and ÃÂ² HCG to have mature sperms in the ejaculate in order to reach fertility. Besides, testosterone is an androgenic hormone which contributes directly to maintaining and promoting spermatogenesis. Given that the actions of Testosterone are mediated by its interaction with Androgen Receptor(AR),the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of CAG/GGN three nucleotides repeats expansion in AR gene on the effective ness of GnRH treatment. Materials and Methods: Sixty two HH subjects were subdivided according to their response to GnRH:31 HH men had positive and 31 HH men had nega tive response to GnRH treatment. The numbers of CAG/GGN in first exon of AR gene was analyzed using Hot Start PCR Sequencing technique. Results: The average of CAG repeats was statistically higher in patients who had positive response in comparison with patients who hadnÃ¢ÂÂt responded to GnRH(p<0.05),but the incidence of GGN repeats were not statistically differ ent among these groups(p>0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that in contrast to GGN,the length of AR gene CAG repeats polymorphism might affect the response to GnRH in HH men. Accordingly, it can be used as a predictive biomarker for response to GnRH in HH hormonal therapy.",2016

25097," Introduction: Microdeletions of Yq chromosome are the most frequent molecular genetic etiology for the male infertility which usually spans AZFa, AZFb and AZFc regions. Microdeletions are mostly seen in AZFc region and usually cover genes actively involved in spermatogenesis. Partial AZFc mi crodeletion may also happen with various spans namely gr/gr, b2/b3 and b1/b3. It is known that the micro TESE outcomes as the surgical process for sperm retrieval from the testis in infertile azoospermic men can be prede termined based on the type of AZF microdeletion. Present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of partial AZFc microdeletions on micro TESE results. Materials and Method: 200 infertile azoospermic men referred to Royan institute were evaluated for the presence of partial AZFc microdeletions be fore they undergo micro TESE.

Methods: We selected four providers and retrieved information on their di sease panels from their websites on the 1 st of February 2016. Disease seve rity was determined using a recently published algorithm. Results: The analyzed panels included from 75 to 255 diseases, while only 29 diseases were screened by all four providers. Overall, providers screened for 303 diseases of which 35% (range:37 40%) classified as profound, 28% (range:29 38%) as severe, 31% (range:19 28%) as moderate and 6% (ran ge:1 12%) as mild. The composition of panels regarding the severity of di seases differed significantly among the providers, mainly due to different frequencies of mild diseases (p,0.008). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the algorithm for disease classification had been designed based on medical professionalsÃ¢ÂÂ opinions on disease severity, which might not neces sarily reflect the lay public opinion. Conclusions: Analyzed panels show great diversity in their composition and size.

We also determined the levels of cell free fetal DNA and total cell free DNA. Materials and Methods We used the HRM technique for fetal genotyping of paternal mutations in maternal plasma from 32 pregnancies at risk of ÃÂ² thalassemia and 57 pregnancies at risk of HbS. The DNA levels in maternal plasma were measured using real time quantitative PCR. Multiples of the median (MoM) values were calculated in women at risk for ÃÂ² thalassemia or HbS. Results Twenty two paternal mutations were detected in 89 pregnant wom en. Although we were successfully able to detect the paternal ÃÂ² thalassemia mutations, the mutant HbS fetuses could not be distinguished from mater nal background in the early weeks of pregnancy. The detection of DYS14 in male fetuses was 100%. The MoM values of women at high risk of having HbS affected fetuses were higher than those for the other groups. Conclusion High resolution melting is a useful method for NIPD of ÃÂ² thalassemias by detecting paternal mutations in the maternal plasma.

25101,"A potential issue with the use of cell free fetal DNA(cfDNA) testing as a uni versal method of screening for aneuploidies, is the possibility of failure to provide a result. This is relevant to comparisons with conventional scree ning, which rarely reports test failures. Data from pregnant women with repeated quality control(QC) failures(i.e., final analysis metrics do not meet internal QC standards) were retrospec tively analysed using bioinformatics methods enabling genome wide detec tion of chromosomal copy number variations, in order to ascertain if such failures are caused by biological factors. Of the 11.584 samples analysed, 12(0.1%) did not returned a result because of a quality metrics failure. In 9 of these samples a single trisomy(T) was identified, whereas the remaining 3 samples showed a double trisomy, one of which involving chromosome 21(T2+T21). Pregnancy follow up at birth revealed five chromosomal abnormalities that have been overlooked: three cases of fetal mosaicism, one case of UPD15, and one case of T21. All the other pregnancies resulted in a normal karyotype, suggesting confined pla cental mosaicism occurrences. A retrospective analysis of the 11.572 preg nancies with a normal result for common aneuploidies revealed further 22(0.2%) samples with a single trisomy. These results demonstrate that aneuploidies other than T21, T18, T13 and sex chromosome aneuploidies, might represent a biological cause of repea ted QC failures. cfDNA testing for genome wide detection of fetal chromoso mal abnormalities has demonstrated a useful tool to reduce the incidence of test failures and to improve prenatal management, obtaining comprehensi ve information about the genetic makeup of the fetus.",2016
25102,"Current non invasive prenatal testing(NIPT) approaches, based on analysis of cell free fetal DNA (cfDNA), involve screening only for common fetal aneu ploidies. Such level of screening allows identification of ~83% of chromoso mal abnormalities detected by karyotyping in a general screening populati on. Hence, a significant proportion(~17%) of fetal chromosomal abnormali ties are not detectable by current cfDNA testing methods. To overcome these limitations, NIPT should be extended to cover the entire genome. Here we present the results of the clinical validation of a novel NIPT de signed to detect genome wide fetal chromosomal abnormalities. A large blinded clinical study was performed, including cfDNA testing of maternal plasma, collected from pregnant women at increased risk for fetal chromo somal abnormalities undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis. Performance was assessed by comparing test results with findings from G band karyoty ping and/or microarray analysis. Among 1419 samples analyzed, there were 100 trisomy (T)21 samp les, 31 T18 samples, 14 T13 samples, 36 samples with sex chromosome aneuploidies(SCAs) and 37 samples that had positive results for a varie ty of CNV aberrations, including both sub chromosomal copy number variants(CNVs) and whole chromosome trisomies. All euploid and chromo somally abnormal samples were classified correctly by NIPT . Clinical sensi tivity and specificity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21, T18, T13, SCAs and genome wide CNVs. This study has demonstrated that genome wide non invasive chromosomal assessment can provide sensitive and specific detection of common and other aneuploidies, as well as a wide range of sub chromosomal abnormali ties, analogous to what can be detected by cytogenetic G band karyotyping following invasive prenatal diagnosis.",2016

Normal and aneuploid samples could be correctly scored even at low fetal fractions, in some cases below 1%.Conclusions: Paired end MPSS allowed simultaneous assessment of fetal fraction, size distribution and chromosome counting which, integrated into a new analysis algorithm allowed the NeoBona test to be successful on a high proportion of samples. Setting analysis cutoffs at the new multifactorial Tscore as evaluated in the course of this study, resulted in high specificity, while also eliminating the need of a lower limit for FF at 4%, thus potentially extending the benefits of cfDNA analysis to a larger proportion of pregnan cies.",2016
25104,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life threatening genetic disorder as sociated with mutations within the CFTR [cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ATP binding cassette sub family C, member 7)] gene. Although >90% of CFTR mutations have already been identified, the severity of the disease, the absence of an effective treatment, and the great heterogeneity of mutations, raise the need for a more effective molecular characterization of CF mutations, especially in prenatal diagnosis. Materials and Methods: We validated this approach in a cohort of 298 samp les, the majority of participants were pregnant women or couples during screening. Sampling is ongoing. Genomic DNA was amplified using the Ion AmpliSeqÃ¢ÂÂ¢ CFTR panel. DNA libraries were pooled, barcoded, and sequen ced using an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. Results: The NGS method helped identifying among known mutations and polymorphisms, 54 rare variants, each found in just 1/298 samples. Among them, 27 are known as pathogenic or causing mild symptoms or CBAVD and 8 are known to be non pathogenic. We identified 19 new variants, not in cluded in the known CF mutation databases. These variants, of unknown clinical significance include c.164+18G>A, c.164+1457 delT , p. Leu541Pro, p. Tyr577Cys, p. Glu826Lys, p. Asp836Tyr, pVal1212Phe, p. Gln1476Glu, c.*325A>G. Conclusions: The next generation sequencing technology, fast and cost ef fective, applied to the analysis of the CFTR gene on a larger scale of samples should allow a better identification of unknown variants and should be pro ven a useful tool for the update of the existing mutation databases and the improvement of genetic counseling.",2016
25105," CGH array has had a major impact on genetic diagnosis over the last years. Comparing with conventional karyotyping, CGH array offers higher re solution and faster results, which makes it the first approach for most of postnatal cases as well as selected prenatal diagnosis referral indications. However, conventional karyotyping should still be considered as a valuable tool to confirm a number of CGH array pathological results or to elucidate the ethiological origin of some pathological findings for accurate genetic as sessment. Our Service in a public tertiary Hospital routinely offers QF PCR and karyo type to all prenatal invasive tests. From 2012 onward, CGH array has been progressively introduced to selected cases, such as fetal ultrasound abnor malities and genetic family history. A total of 534 CGH array prenatal cases were performed including amnio centesis (n,443) and chorionic (n,91) samples employing a 60 K custom oligonucleotide based CGH array (qChip Pre v1.1 Complete), that allows a resolution of 100 125 Kb in regions causing genomic disorders. Results were obtained at an average time of 7 days. Pathologic results were detected in 40 cases (7.5%) 19 of which (47.5%) were confirmed by karyotype. Three different categories of cytogenetic as certained abnormalities were defined: those that were surely detected by karyotype (n,10), those that were detected due to the CGH array pathologic result (n,8) that included unexpected possible inherited translocations, and rare findings (n,1) that was defined as a ring of chromosome 15.We conclude that although CGH array is an increasing, powerful analysis for prenatal diagnosis procedures, conventional karyotyping is still useful to as certain specific chromosomal rearrangements.",2016
25106,"Introduction: The increased sensitivity of chromosomal microarray (CMA) technology allows for improved detection of genomic alterations. Conse quently CMA is now recommended as a first tier test for evaluating multip le anomalies in the fetus. This technology has been embraced by low risk pregnant women in order to gain as much information about their fetus as possible. While there is an expected increase in the detection yield, there is also an increased risk of detecting VOUSs. Objectives: We describe our results within the unique setting of prenatal counseling, often complicated by the unknown phenotype and the paucity of information available. Results: A total of 750 prenatal samples were processed using CMA. The in dications for prenatal testing included: maternal age, abnormal ultrasound findings, family history and parental request. Clinical implication of detec ted CNVÃ¢ÂÂs was determined based on local guidelines and those described in the literature. Of samples tested, 32 (4%) were pathogenic variants, 6 (0.8%) were designated as likely pathogenic, and 55 (7.3%) were designa ted as VOUSs. Parental testing was done in some cases to determine whether the finding was inherited or de novo. All results were discussed in genetic counseling. Conclusion: Physicians and patients alike crave certainty. However, CMA testing often lead to the detection of VOUS, which may be associated with a variable phenotype, reduced expressivity and incomplete penetrance. In such cases, expectant parents are often confused and perplexed. In our ex perience, proper genetic counseling may alleviate parental anxiety and avo id undue termination of a clinically unaffected fetus.",2016
25107,"Introduction: Fetal aneuploidy caused by maternal meiotic chromosome se gregation errors is an established cause of pregnancy loss. We investigated whether unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions (RSA) are also asso ciated with increased rates of aneuploidy in spermatozoa of RSA partners (Ã¢ÂÂRSA malesÃ¢ÂÂ).Materials and Methods: Sperm samples of eleven Ã¢ÂÂRSA malesÃ¢ÂÂ were evalu ated for elevated diploidy and disomy levels of chromosomes 1 22, X and Y by multicolour Ã¢ÂÂsperm FISHÃ¢ÂÂ.Results: Compared with base line aneuploidy rates in healthy males, signi ficantly elevated mean disomy rates (pÃ¢ÂÂ¤0.05) were observed for chromo somes 1, 2 and 16, while chromosomes 3, 7, 8, 14, 17 and X were inconspi cuous in all eleven patients. We observed increased disomy rates for at least three chromosomes in more than 60% of our patients, but no significant increase of the overall mean sperm disomy or diploidy rate. Importantly, meiotic errors involving chromosome 16 contributed to increased sperm disomy in 7/11 of our patients. Conclusions: The high relative contribution of maternal disomy 16 to aneu ploidy related fetal loss is well established. Our data suggest that among pa ternal meiotic errors nondisjunction of chromosome 16 might have similar relative influence on fetal aneuploidy. Our findings argue against using the Ã¢ÂÂstandard clinical FISH probe setÃ¢ÂÂ 13/18/21/X/Y in Ã¢ÂÂRSA malesÃ¢ÂÂ, because aneuploidy of chromosome 1, 2, and 16, and probably also 6, 15 and 21 ap pear to be prevalent in spermatozoa from this particular group of patients, and chromosome 16 appears to be the most promising biomarker for dia gnostic and prognostic objects in RSA patients.

25108,"Rare developmental disorders are genetically heterogeneous. Genetic te sting following a termination of pregnancy, on account of congenital abnor malities, often fails to make a molecular diagnosis. In such circumstances, the recurrence risk for future pregnancies is based on the phenotype alone. For a suspected autosomal recessive syndrome, the risk to future pregnan cies would be reported as 25%, assuming inheritance of one causative allele from each parent. We report here results from trio based exome sequen cing of two unrelated fetuses, each with a suspected recessively inherited developmental disorder, within a larger series of nine trios. In both fetuses, a combination of a de novo loss of function mutation on one parental haplo type and an inherited loss of function variant on the other parental haplo type were identified, respectively, as the cause of the recessively inherited developmental disorders, Ellis van Creveld and Fraser syndromes. De novo mutation has only rarely been reported as a contributory cause of recessive disease, but it markedly reduces the recurrence risk for future pregnancies. Our results suggest that causative de novo mutations may contribute to the cause of autosomal recessive disease more frequently than has been consi dered hitherto.",2016
25109," RYR1 related congenital myopathies present clinical, histological, and ge netic heterogeneity: a subset of patients has an antenatal onset form of the disorder, characterized during pregnancy by decreased fetal movements, polyhydramnios and arthrogryposis. We present a case of two sib fetuses, affected by antenatal onset myopathy, conceived through artificial insemination with donor sperm. The first sib presented a NT of 7,76 mm at combined first trimester screening test. At 12+0 gestational week, ultrasound examination revealed large nuchal sep tated cystic hygromas, mild ascitic effusion, absent fetal movements, con tracted limbs and club feet. No cardiac or encephalic malformations were detected and biometric parameters were normal. The pregnancy was termi nated. Karyotype formula was 46,XY. Testing for myotonic dystrophy (DM1) was negative. In the second pregnancy, conceived by the same biological parents, first tri mester ultrasound examination demonstrated comparable clinical features (cystic hygromas, absent fetal movements and contracted limbs) and the pregnancy was terminated. Karyotype formula was 46,XX. Exome sequen cing performed on the second fetus revealed a compound heterozygosity for two novel mutations in RYR1: a frameshift mutation (g.38951153CG>C) and a splice acceptor site mutation (g.39019237G>A). Sanger sequencing confirmed these mutations and the healthy mother resulted heterozygous carrier of g.39019237G>A. Both variants are predicted to be pathogenetic and clinical findings are suggestive of a RYR1 related congenital myopathy. However, co segregation studies in the first fetus are needed. This clinical case confirms the great diagnostic power of whole exome se quencing in autosomal recessive disorders and exemplifies the hard challen ge of gamete donorsÃ¢ÂÂ selection process related to ultra rare diseases.",2016

Background: Chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing is widely used in prenatal and postnatal setting. Penetrance of many copy number variants (CNVs) is incomplete; this poses challenges for genetic counseling. The pur pose of our study was to compare the prevalence of 20 known recurrent pathogenic CNVs in prenatal and postnatal cohort. Methods: During 2010 2016 our clinical hospital based laboratory perfor med 8500 tests on index low risk prenatal samples (3600), fetuses with congenital malformations (2750) and postnatal samples (2150). Recurrent pathogenic CNVs were classified as high penetrance (>40%; 8 CNVs), mode rate penetrance (10 40%; 8 CNVs) and low penetrance (<10%; 4 CNVs). We calculated the prevalence of these CNVs in: I) normal fetuses, II) fetuses with malformations, III) individuals with developmental disabilities/congenital malformations. Results: CNVs were detected in 2% of prenatal samples (139/6350) and 6% (125/2150) of postnatal samples. Prevalence of high penetrance CNVs was 0.3% in group I, 0.6% in group II and 2.4% in group III and of moderate penetrance CNVs 0.5% in group I and II and 1.2% in group III. Prevalence of low penetrance CNVs was similar in all groups e.g for 15q11 microdeletion (NIPA1) it was 0.7% in all groups. Conclusions: We show that the prevalence of low penetrance CNVs is simi lar in low risk prenatal and in postnatal cohort, pointing that these CNVs may have a minor contribution to the overall heritability of developmental disorders. Information on prevalence for different pathogenic CNVs, espe cially as it pertains to diagnostic yield in genetic testing, should be useful to clinicians considering chromosomal microarray analysis in fetuses with and without structural anomalie",2016
25111,"Introduction: In about 5% of the couples with multiple miscarriages a ba lanced chromosomal aberrations in one of the partners is detected. Case: In our case, father is carrier of a der(22;22)(q10;q10) and as such can produce gametes with either two chromosomes 22 or none, both leading to a miscarriage due to a trisomy or a monosomy 22, respectively. The couple had had two miscarriages, however, they also had a healthy son who showed a 46,XY karyotype. This might indicate UPD22mat or the presence of a nor mal 46,XY cell line in the gametes of our patient. Results: Paternity testing confirmed that our patient indeed was the father. To look for a mosaicism with a normal cell line, karyotyping of a skin biopsy was performed and showed also in al cells a der(22;22). In buccal cells no normal cell line was found either, ,.The question is whether the children have a maternal UPD22. In literature 4 cases have been described of a UPD22, all as a result of a trisomy rescue mechanism and never a monosomy rescue. No cases of multiple children with UPD22 in one familiy have been reported as yet. Conclusion: Normally we tell carriers of a der(22;22)(q10;q10) that they can not have biological children. Our case show that this isnÃ¢ÂÂt always true. Two explanations therefore could be: there is a normal cell line present in the gametes of the father leading to normal sperm cells, or the healthy child ren have a maternal UPD22.

Both had elevated levels of ACTH, gonadotropins, progesterone, corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone, and reduced estradiol, testosterone, androstendione, 17 OH P , DHEA S, cortisol, aldosterone and renin activity. Sanger sequencing was performed to detect ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 59Back to index variants/mutations in CYP17A1 gene. Results: Mutational analysis showed that the two sisters were compound heterozygotes for p.

The present siblings were born from parents with origins near Sevilla (Spain). The analysis of 8 polymorphisms in CYP17A1 in this family and in two Brazilian families, homozygote for each of the mutations, suggested that paternal allele with p.

25113,"Introduction: DNA methylation has been shown to influence tissue specific gene expression and differentiation. Taking advantage of tissue specific me thylation patterns, several groups focused their work on the identification of fetal specific markers based on the methylation differences between ma ternal and fetal DNA for the development of non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal aneuploidies. Materials and Methods: Initially, MeDIP NGS was applied to characterize DNA methylation differences between 3 chorionic villus samples (CVS), 3 female peripheral blood (WBF) samples and 2 plasma samples. A subset of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was confirmed using MeDIP in combination with a targeted enrichment method followed by NGS. Fur thermore, the inter individual methylation variability of the selected DMRs was investigated and the classification efficiency of the method was verified using normal and trisomy 21 spike in samples. Finally, normal and aneuplo id pregnancies (n,32) were used for the detection of fetal aneuploidies (26 normal, 4 T21, 1 T18, 1 T13).Results: Initially, based on specific selection criteria 331 hypermethylated fetal specific DMRs were selected and confirmed in 24 samples (p<2x10 16). Twenty nine CVS and twenty eight plasma samples were used to assess inter individual methylation variability. Trisomy 21 spike in samples were detected with the z scores increasing as spiked in percentage increased. Fi nally, this method exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity for all normal, trisomy 21 and trisomy 18 cases. The trisomy 13 case was marginally be low threshold. Conclusions: Results show that this approach can potentially be used for the enrichment of fetal DNA in maternal plasma and the development of a novel NIPT method for fetal aneuploidies.

25114,"Disorders of sexual development (DSD) are a very important clinical issue with its different aspects relating to diagnosis, treatment and sex of rearing. The classification of ambiguous genitalia in patients is difficult because si milar or identical phenotypes may have several aetiologies. In one of every 4500 births, the genital appearance is abnormal and it is not possible to de cide at first glance the sex of the infant. To study the genetical aspects of DSD we have collected a cohort of 37 patients with different DSD phenotypes. Using GTG banded chromosome analysis we identified 4 46,XX males and 32 46,XY females. The karyotype of one male was 45,ÃÂ¥+mar. After PCR and FISH analysis of SRY gene location there of four 46,XX males were determi ned as SRY positive with Xp; Yp translocations and two 46,XY females were SRY negative.

The postnatal detection of trisomy 21 has been available since 2005 and prenatal detection since 2008. All centers that diagnose DS prenatally and postnatally in the period from January 01, 2005 to December 31, 2015 were included. In this study, 93 fetuses and 329 babies were diagnosed in the 10 year period. On average, each year 33 DS individuals were born and 13 DS fetuses were diagnosed prenatally. The cal culated incidence for the live born DS individuals in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 1:999. Between 2005 and 2015, the LB prevalence of T21 was 9.6 per 10000 births (range 6.3 12.3) and the total prevalence of T21 was 19.1 per 10000 births (range 10.8 25.0). The T21 prevalence per 10000 births in creases exponentially with the advanced maternal age. Prenatal prevalence per 10000 births is ~1 for mothers younger than 35, but increases expo nentially with advanced maternal age (32 for mothers older than 40 years). The most common indications for invasive prenatal testing were obstetric ultrasound screening combined with biochemical serum analysis followed by the advanced maternal age. There was an increase in total T21 preva lence, mainly explained by increasing maternal age. Live birth prevalence remained stable over time even after the introduction of prenatal diagnosis.",2016
25116,"Background: The Down syndrome (DS) etiology is still unknown. However, all data suggest that the mechanism is more complex than previously sup posed. Epigenetic mechanisms, including miRNAs gene expression regulati on, are one of potential influencing factors. The aim of this study was to com pare miRNAs expressions in placentas with normal and trisomic karyotype and to associate differentially expressed miRNAs with concrete biological pathways. Materials and Methods: In the pilot study, 754 miRNAs were profiled in 30 chorionic villi samples (CVS) 14 normal and 16 DS, using real time PCR technology and TaqMan Human miRNA Array Cards A and B. Twelve diffe rently expressed miRNAs between compared groups of samples were va lidated on 50 independent samples (25 normal and 25 DS) using TaqMan miRNA Assays. The Mann Whitney test with a cutoff p value < 0.05 was used for results evaluation. Functional annotation and diseases association of selected miRNAs were performed using several web based software tools (miRWalk, DAVID, WebGestalt).Results: Eight miRNAs were verified as upregulated in DS placentas; three of these miRNAs are located on chromosome 21 (miR 99a, miR 125b and let 7c). Many biological pathways associated with DS complications, as neurodegenerative diseases, leukemia, transcriptional regulation or apo ptosis, were identified to be potentially disrupted. Moreover, miRNAs ove rexpressed in DS placenta apparently regulates genes crucial for placenta development (GJA1, CDH11, EGF, ERVW 1, ERVFRD 1, LEP or INHA).Conclusion: Our findings suggest possible participation of miRNAs in etiolo gy of Down syndrome including DS placenta ectopic development.

25119,"Fetal aneuploidies constitute over 80% of chromosomal abnormalities at birth. Currently, themajority are detected using invasive screening tests, involving both risk to the mother and fetus. Recent studies propose non invasive methods to de tect fetal chromosomal aneuploidies in maternal plasma using common NGS technologies; whole genome sequencing or the selection of various chro mosomal loci using a proprietary methodology (DANSRTM), not available to the general scientific community. Hence, we here present a novel custom bioinformatic NGS design for non invasive prenatal testing. Our strategy employs the dosage detection of an unique set of markers along chromosomes 13, 18, 21, and X, compared to a control (chromosome 1). The design also incorporates chromosome Y markers for sexing, and numerous SNPs for fingerprinting and for the determination of the fractional fetal DNA concentration. Approximately 1,500 very reliable markers have been selected, with lengths ranging from 100 to 300 bp. The sequences have been captured using Roche NimbleGen EZ library and have been sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina platform. A total of 16 samples, including trisomies and normal controls have been used in the validation. Due to an error in the library generation, experimental modifications are still under development, and thus, the performance of the validation has been lower than expected. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate a 67% of sensitivity and 70% of specificity. In conclusion, our design would provide a sensitive and robust method for the fetal aneuploidies detection in maternal blood, and could decrease as well the number of invasive tests.

The aims of this study were to determine Fragile X syndrome (FXS) CGG repeat alleles and frequen cies in our population and to determine if TP PCR is an adequate method to perform generalized population prenatal screening. The molecular results of the study are: 1) a prevalence of premutation (PM) carriers of 1 in 106 which is the highest described to date in any population; 2) Information on the AGG interruptions and CGG repeat numbers that showed that the most frequent alleles are 10A9A9 (38,4 %), 9A9A9 (15,1 %) and 10A9 (10, 5 %). Furthermore, alleles with 0 AGG interruptions or with a pure (uninter rupted) CGG repeat run larger than 34 (presumably more unstable), were highest among PM alleles (10 % and 100 % respectively) compared to nor mal alleles (0, 7% and 0, 07 %, respectively). Collected geographic origins of participants make it very unlikely that the high prevalence observed in this study is originated by founder effects. As for the psychosocial aspects of the study, we found a very high voluntary participation, self reported high level of satisfaction and low levels of added stress. In addition, we detect low knowledge of the FXS (25%) and irrelevancy of the self reported health data. The high level of acceptance and unexpected high frequency of expan ded PM alleles in females in the Balearic Islands makes a very compelling argument for prenatal and/or preconceptional FXS screening.",2016

We showed a correlation between younger maternal age and a less stable transmission (pv,0.021, OR 0.734, CI (0.564 0.954)). Two cases in which the fetus inherited a mosaic of the al lele were found. We also found a woman who was not a pre mutation carrier and transmitted the allele in an expanded lengh to her fetus. Conclusions: No correlation was found between AGG number abnormalities and allele instability in the tested population. Younger women were found at greater risk for unstable transmission to their fetus. A case of non pre muta tion carrier that can transmit a CGG expansion was recorded. This unusual finding requires further evaluation.",2016
25123,"Introduction: Hyperandrogenism, a hallmark of polycystic ovarian syn drome, caused by fetal androgen exposure, is suspected to act via altered expressions of related genes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ex pression of GAGT 6 and StAR genes, involved in steroidogenesis pathway, in adult female rats prenatally exposed to androgen excess by comparing them in different phases of estrus cycle with non treated rats. Materials and Methods: Eight pregnant Wistar rats in the experimental group were treated by subcutaneous injection of 5 mg free testosterone on day 20 of pregnancy, while controls (n , 8) received 500 mL of solvent. Adult female off springs of each mother were divided into four groups based on observation of their vaginal smear. Along with measurement of serum ste roidogenic sexual hormones and gonadotropins levels using ELISA, RNAs were extracted from ovarian theca cells and relative expression levels were measured using Cyber green Real Time PCR. Results: Comparing intervention and control group, relative expression of GATA 6 and StAR increased by 2.08 (p<0.001) and 1.4 (p<0.05) fold, respec tively. Despite changes in expression of each gene in different phases, their trend of expression was almost similar, with the maximum change being observed in diestrus. Conclusions: This investigation on gene expression changes in ovarian theca cells in prenatally androgenized rats demonstrated elevated expression of the genes studied. Further studies on genes from steroidogenesis and other reproduction related pathways are recommended to confirm these findings and to further explore prenatal effects of excess androgens.",2016
25124,"Introduction: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to detect the com mon hemophilia A (HEMA) inversion mutations represents a major tech nical challenge. Indirect linkage analysis using polymorphic markers is possible, but is dependent on availability of informative markers. We have developed a single tube tetradecaplex panel of highly polymorphic micro satellite markers for simplified PGD of HEMA by haplotype linkage analysis with/without mutation detection. Materials and Methods: Twenty eight markers <1Mb from F8 were selected for initial testing. Compatible markers were optimized into a single tube pa nel and genotyped in 135 Chinese females. The panel was also tested on sin gle cell whole genome amplification (WGA) products. PGD was performed on a couple at risk of transmitting a point mutation, consisting of single tube multiplex PCR of fully informative markers and the mutation site amplicon, followed by GeneScan analysis. Minisequencing was performed on an ali quot of PCR product to detect the point mutation. Results: Thirteen markers were optimized into a single tube PCR panel to gether with AMELX/Y. Observed marker heterozygosities ranged from 0.45 to 0.84, and 80% of the studied population were heterozygous for Ã¢ÂÂ¥5 mar kers, while 95% were heterozygous for at least one marker on either side of F8. In the IVF PGD case, the point mutation was successfully detected from single embryo blastomeres and perfectly correlated with a specific marker haplotype. Conclusions: The single tube tetradecaplex marker panel provides a com mon platform containing sufficient marker redundancy for general appli cation to potentially any PGD of HEMA, through haplotype linkage analysis either alone or in combination with mutation detection.

25125,"Introduction: The current data support an important role of leptin system in the pathophysiology of male infertility in animals and humans. The aim of this study was to examine whether genetic variability in leptin and leptin receptor genes influence male infertility. Methods: We performed a case control study and were searching for an as sociation between polymorphisms of leptin and leptin receptor genes and male infertility. The study group consisted of 317 patients with idiopathic infertility and a control group of 241 fertile men from Slovenia. Four SNPs in leptin gene and four SNPs in leptin receptor gene were chosen and geno typed. Statistically significant SNP was further validated in additional 255 infertile patients and 168 controls from Serbia and Macedonia. Results: In the Slovenian population we found a statistically significant dif ference in genotype distribution for rs10244329 polymorphism in leptin gene (recessive genotype model, p value ,0.048). The trend toward stati stically significant difference in genotype distribution for rs10244329 po lymorphism was found also in the Serbian and Macedonian populations (p value,0.09). Conclusions: Our data suggest that genetic variability in the leptin gene might be associated with male infertility warranting further confirmation and mechanistic investigations.

25126," Introduction: Fetal intra uterine growth restriction, particularly when early (< 24 weeks) and severe (< 3rd percentile on estimated fetal weight) is as sociated with fetal genetic disease. However, scarce information is available about this association with microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. The aim of this multicenter study is to assess the incremental yield of ge nomic microarray over karyotyping in early and severe growth restriction. Material and Methods: This multicenter study included 139 consecutive early and severe growth restricted fetuses, studied during a 3 year period (January 2013 December 2015) in 3 centers of Barcelona. QF PCR and BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) array CGH (CytoChip Focus Constitutio nal, BlueGnome, Illumina) were performed in DNA extracted from amniotic fluid after amniocentesis. The incremental yield was defined by the rate of fetuses presenting with a pathogenic copy number variant below 10 Mb in normal QF PCR results, stratified by the presence of fetal malformations. Results: In our series 9 pathogenic copy number variants were found. Among non malformed growth restricted fetuses, a 5.7% (95%CI:1.3 to 10.1)(6/16) incremental yield of genomic microarray was observed over karyotyping, while this rate was 9.1% (95% CI: 0.7 to 18.9) (3/33) in mal formed fetuses. Conclusion: The use of genomic microarray provides a 5.7% incremental yield in non malformed restricted fetuses with a normal karyotype, incre asing up to 9.1% in malformed fetuses. These results confirmed previous findings of the single large series on growth restricted fetuses (3% and 10% respectively). Our findings support the use of genomic microarray after a normal QF PCR or/and karyotype.",2016
25127,"Introduction: Blood incompatibility between mother and fetus causes he molytic disease of the fetus and the newborn (HDFN), a potentially fatal condition. The blood groups mainly responsible for the most severe form of HDFN are RhD and Kell. Nowadays fetal Kell genotype can only be detected through invasive procedures, increasing the chance of maternal alloimmu nization. Detection of fetal Kell genotype in circulating cfDNA in maternal plasma would enable prevention of HDFN avoiding risks associated to in vasive procedures. In this study, an innovative test for Kell genotyping was designed and optimized on cffDNA to create a non invasive prenatal test for prevention of HDFN caused by Kell incompatibility. Materials and Methods: 17 samples: 1 alloimmunized pregnant woman plasma presenting anti K antibodies, 6 dilution of kell positive DNA in kell negative DNA and 10 control blood samples were collected and analyzed. Real time PCR was developed for the allelic discrimination of K1 and K2 and Kell genotype determination. Results: The K1/K2 genotype was correctly determined in all control samp les. Results on the Kell positive dilution allow to verify the linearity and efficiency of the method. Results on cffDNA from a Kell negative pregnant woman confirmed the Kell positive genotype of the fetus. Fetal fraction was determinate using the Kell positive DNA quantification. Conclusions: An efficient and reliable strategy for Kell genotyping is herein presented. The method was optimized on cffDNA in order to create a non invasive prenatal test which could be routinely used for the prevention of hemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn.",2016
25128,"Introduction: prenatal diagnoses of microdeletion syndromes, which donÃ¢ÂÂt show ultrasound alterations until the third trimester, are always difficult, especially if we want to correlate phenotype genotype. The introduction of microarray based technology enabled genome in prenatal diagnosis resul ting in the detection of recurrent microdeletions in foetuses. We try to corre lation between these ultrasound alterations and Koolen de Vries syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, facial dysmorphisms, epilepsy, heart defects and kidney/urologic anomalies. Materials and Methods: We present 4 foetuses with 17q21.31 microdeleti on. All of them showed anomalies in the third trimester, 3 ventriculomegaly leve moderate and one of them T .N. 4.2 mm at first trimester, V. I. hypereco genicity, severe CIR and disgenesis of corpus callosum at birth. Array SNPs performed on uncultured amniocytes. Array SNPs were performanced by HIScan Illumina, ES CYTOSNP850k. Results: All of them revealed a 17q21.31 microdeletion. Conclusions: The appearance of minor malformations in prenatal diagnosis, especially in pregnancies over 22 weeks, is a source of uncertainty when it comes to genetic analysis. However, these findings are the only prenatal expression of many genetic syndromes, as many of them do not present major malformations in this period. From our point of view, it is important to evaluate each case individually and make these genetic studies given the impossibility of another form of screening and its consequences in postnatal life. To our knowledge, this kind of malformations should be a high marker of this syndrome.",2016

25130,"Introduction: The MAMLD1 gene (Xp28) is thought to cause disorder of sex development (DSD) in 46,XY patients, mostly presenting with hypospadi as, and, recently, gonadal dysgenesis. However, there is some controversy about its role in sex development because some MAMLD1 variants are also detected in normal individuals, several MAMLD1 mutations have wild type (WT) activity, male Mamld1 knockout mouse have normal genitalia and re production; and other species with or without DSD harbor also MAMLD1 variants in the genome. We aimed to analyse MAMLD1 sequence variations in individuals presenting with a wide spectrum of DSD phenotypes. Patients and Methods: Sanger sequencing was performed in 108 46,XY DSD individuals to detect MAMDL1 gene variations/mutations. Functional experiments were completed in non steroidogenic and steroidogenic cell lines. We assessed transcriptional activity (on Hes3 and CYP17A1 promot ers) and expression of WT and mutant MAMLD1. Besides, we tested the MAMLD1 effect on androgen production by testing the CYP17A1 activity. Results: We found 9 MAMLD1 mutations (7 novel) in 9/108 46,XY DSD pa tients. In vitro assays revealed that most MAMLD1 variants acted similarly to the WT . Only the L210X mutation showed loss of function in all tests, while variants L724V and S730S showed a decrease in CYP17A1 promoter activation. We found no effect of either WT or any MAMLD1 variant on CY P17A1 enzyme activity. Also, no difference for MAMLD1 protein expression was found, except for a shorter L210X. Conclusion: Our data support the notion that MAMLD1 sequence variations may not suffice to explain the DSD phenotype in carriers.",2016
25131,"Introduction. Coordinated work of gene cascades in maternal and fetal cells is crucial for mother placenta fetus system formation and functioning. Reasons for up to 60% of spontaneous abortions remain unknown. Micro RNAs act as post transcriptional gene regulators, and affect gene expressi on directly in the cells of their origin or take part in intercellular signaling through vesicular transport. In current work, we investigated the expressi on of three micro RNAs in embryonic, chorionic and decidual tissues after spontaneous abortion compared to normal first trimester pregnancies. Materials and methods. Bioinformatic study was conducted and miR 335 5p, miR 203a and miR 204 5p were chosen for further investigation. Samp les of chorionic, embryonic tissue and decidua were taken after surgical termination of normally progressing pregnancies (n , 14) and spontaneous abortion (n , 10) in 5 9 week of gestation. Micro RNA expression was ana lyzed using quantitative real time PCR method. MiR 92a 1 5p was used as a reference gene. All experiments were conducted in triplicates. Data were analyzed using the 2 ÃÂÃÂCT method. Results. The expression of miR 203a 3ÃÂ was decreased in decidual and em bryonic tissues in spontaneous abortion compared to normal pregnancy. Expression of miR 204 5p and miR 335 5p was equal in all studied tissues and in spontaneous abortion compared to normal gestation. Conclusion. The results demonstrated that low miR 203a 3ÃÂ expression le vel in decidual and embryonic tissues could be associated with spontaneous abortion in first trimester of pregnancy.

25132,"of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Budapest, Hungary. Background: Preeclampsia is the leading cause of maternal and fetal mor bidity and mortality, affecting 3 8% of all pregnancies worldwide. Unfortu nately, the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is still not clear. miRNAs are small, non coding RNA molecules, which negatively regulate gene expression. They are associated with several pathological conditions, including preg nancy complications such as preeclampsia. The aim of our study was to find preeclampsia related miRNA regulatory mechanisms using bioinformatics approaches. Methods: We analyzed miRNA (GSE57050) and mRNA (GSE73374) ex pression datasets, which were created under similar experimental circum stances. Differently expressed miRNAs were identified for the estimation of their inhibitory effect. We integrated miRNA and gene expression profiles with the MAGIA web tool, and created a bipartite network from the signi ficant miRNA mRNA pairs using the Cytoscape software. Two subnetworks were expanded by protein protein interactions from the HPRD database. We analyzed the network elements using different bioinformatics tools and through literature research. Results: We created a network, which consists of 85 nodes and 80 edges signalizing the connections between 52 regulated genes and 33 miRNAs. 11 of the genes are preeclampsia related and 9 of them were targeted by mul tiple miRNAs. 8 miRNAs are associated with preeclampsia, and 13 miRNAs regulated more than one mRNA. Hsa mir 210 was the highest degree node in the network and its role in preeclampsia is well known. Conclusions: We identified several miRNA mRNA interactions, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Further investigations are needed to validate these mechanisms and to unfold the possibilities of de veloping potential therapeutic targets.",2016
25133,"Introduction: Around 10 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies result in miscarriage and about 50% of early pregnancy losses has chromosome ab normalities. Most of them are numerical abnormalities such as autosomal trisomies, poliploidies and monosomy X. However, structural chromosome abnormalities are also found in around 5% of the cases, most of them unba lanced, and identified through karyotyping. Materials and Methods: We describe the chromosome rearrangements de tected in a series of 1119 consecutive first trimester spontaneous miscar riages, obtained through CV sampling before evacuation and semi direct cytogenetic analysis. When an unexpected rearrangement was found in the CV sample, chromosome analysis of parents was performed. Results: Cytogenetic result was achieved in 1011 samples, from which 711 showed an abnormal karyotype (70.3%). Thirty six chromosome rearran gements were detected (5.1% of the abnormal cases), 5 balanced (0.7%) and 31 unbalanced (4.7%). Three of the balanced rearrangements presen ted with an additional trisomy. Among the unbalanced rearrangements there were 10 reciprocal translocations, 5 were previously unknown: 3 of them turned out to be inherited, 1 de novo and 1 with no information. Two inversions were unexpected and turned out to be inherited. Only 2 out of the 12 Robertsonian translocations were previously known; among the unexpected ones, 8 were de novo, 1 inherited and 1 with no information. Conclusions: Karyotyping allows the detection and interpretation of such unexpected chromosome rearrangements and adds valuable information for the genetic counseling of the couple and their family.

25134,"Around 10 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies result in miscarriage and about 50% of early pregnancy losses has chromosome abnormalities. Chromosomal mosaicism in chorionic villi samplings (CVS) is detected in 1 2% of the cases and can involve different numerical and structural chro mosome abnormalities. Depending on the distribution of the abnormal cells lineage among the placental tissues, there are different classes of mo saicism. The purpose of this work is to identify the rate and spectrum of placental chromosomal mosaicism involved in first trimester miscarriages in our population. We present the placental chromosomal mosaicism found in a series of more than one thousand of arrested pregnancies obtained through chorionic villi sampling before evacuation. The chromosomal analysis was carried out by semi direct/short term (STC) and long term culture (LTC). Of 1011 CVS samples analysed we obtained results in both cultures in 592 (58.5%). Among them 21 (3.5%) showed discrepant karyotypes. The chro mosome abnormality was present in STC in 9 cases (43%) while the karyo type obtained in LTC was normal only in two cases (9.5%). In all cases except four, chromosomal abnormality was numerical, and the structural abnorma lities were present only in LTC. In 33% of cases we found discrepant abnor mal karyotypes between both cultures. These data underline the importance of karyotyping both placental layers, also in spontaneous abortions, to obtain a reliable result and a predictive va lue for fetal involvement and provides clinical elements to offer an accurate genetic counselling.

Introduction: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in preimplantation em bryos, assessed predominantly by qPCR, was recently suggested as a poten tial novel biomarker for selection of the most competent euploid embryo (Fragouli E et al, 2015; Diez Juan A et al, 2015). The embryos with lower mtDNA content were reported to show significantly better implantation rates. Most importantly, embryos with mtDNA amount exceeding a certain threshold (0.003% by qPCR, 0.070% of total reads by NGS; Fragouli E et al, 2015) did not implant. Materials and methods: We reanalyzed 56 trophectoderm samples from euploid embryos (determined previously by aCGH) by NGS using the Ion Torrent platform allowing simultaneous CNV analysis of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. 18 embryos were transferred (10 SETs, 4 DETs with known mtDNA level and transfer outcome for both embryos). We analyzed a putative correlation of the implantation outcome and the level of mtDNA. Results: NGS confirmed euploidy and established mtDNA amount in all 56 cases (mean 0.064%, median 0.054%). 33% (6/18) of the transferred em bryos implanted, while 67% (12/18) did not. Interestingly, mtDNA amount did not differ between implanted and non implanted embryos (P 0.285). Moreover, in 2 successfully implanted embryos the suggested 0.070% thres hold was substantially exceeded (0.368%, 0.146% respectively).Conclusions: Although the results obtained by qPCR in two previous studies indicated the application of mtDNA content as a predictor of embryo com petence to produce viable pregnancy, the results obtained by NGS using the Ion Torrent platform should be further cautiously studied and verified in a larger cohort of samples.",2016
25136,"Introduction: Maternal factors that may lead to abnormal preimplantation development include mitochondria, which are the most abundant organel les in the oocyte. Genes required for mitochondrial function are encoded by both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the nuclear DNA (nDNA) neces sitating the coordination between the two genomes. Mitochondrial nuclear mismatch has been proposed as a cause of embryonic cell death. Changes in ATP synthesis and metabolic reactions in the mitochondrial electron trans port chain (ETC) have been linked to female infertility. This study explores the effect of differences in mtDNA and nDNA haplotypes in genes involved in the ETC by assessing preimplantation embryo development. Methods: Maternal and paternal mitochondrial DNA was analysed from 11 fertile and 12 infertile couples by Long range PCR and NGS. The selected nuclear genes were sequenced using SureSelect QXT from Agilent. Each sample was assigned to a mitochondrial haplogroup using HaploGrep and confirmed by the EMMA software. PGD cycles from the fertile group were compared for the proportions of both oocytes that fertilised and embryos that developed to blastocyst. Results: Several mitochondrial haplogroups were identified reflecting the diverse ethnic population in London. Overall more couples from the infer tile (4/ 12) had identical mtDNA haplotypes compared to the fertile group (1/11). Within the fertile group the presence of the T haplogroup was asso ciated with poor blastocyst formation. Analysis of the selected nuclear gene sequences as well as investigation of the interaction of the T haplotype SNPs remains to be investigated before mitochondrial nuclear mismatch can be correlated to embryo development.",2016

The chromosomes were found to be normal (Affymetrix HD 2.65M, resolution of about 100kb). As the sonographic markers beca me worse, NGS (TruSightÃ¢ÂÂ¢ One Sequencing panel, 4613 Gene, illumina Inc.) was performed, but still did not reveal the underlying cause. At week 22 the couple decided for termination of pregnancy. The pathological examination revealed a male fetus with low birth weight, microcephaly and severe con tractions with webs. The fetal brain was premature with agenesis of corpus callosum and hydrocephalus internus. The result of an interdisciplinary case discussion was the clinical suspicion of Neu Laxova Syndrome. Reevaluation of NGS data showed only one deleterious missense mutation in the PHGDH gene, and reevaluation of microarray data showed a down ward pattern of makers, indicating the possibility of a deletion affecting PHGDH. By MLPA the deletion of exon 12 and 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of the PHGDH gene was confirmed in the fetus and the mother. The healthy father was carrier of the mutation in the PHGDH gene.

Considering possible complete/partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS/CAIS), the AR was analysed, identifying a novel mutation. Disclosure of the CAIS diagnosis took place at 22 weeks and included participation of specialists in paediatrics, genetics and a paediatric urology. At 30 weeks, a psychological assessment was carried out for both parents. There was evidence of elevated somatiza tion and anxiety in the mother and both parents showed notable traumatic stress. However, both expressed a degree of relief at going into the birth with knowledge of the diagnosis and requested a Ã¢ÂÂbirth planÃ¢ÂÂ allowing for privacy with respect to (public) discussion of the diagnosis.

25140,"Background: Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a novel accurate scree ning technology for early detection of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies, but the test performance of NIPT for sex chromosomal abnormality (SCA) is not as good as it is for trisomy 21, 18, and 13. For the diagnosis of SCA, the maternal or fetal mosaicism, maternal chromosomal abnormalities, and multiple pregnancies have been considered as a confounding factor in NIPT . Here, we present a false positive fetal SCA (45, X) result caused by maternal sex chromosomal mosaicism. Case: A 36 year old primigravida was offered NIPT due to advanced mater nal age. The NIPT result was available at 13 +1 weeks and negative for trisomy 21, 18, and 13. However, Turner syndrome (45, X) was reported in NIPT . She underwent an amniocentesis at 15+5 weeks in order to confirm the identi fication of 45, X obtained through the analysis of NIPT and the result of am niocentesis showed that the fetus was normal (46, XY). For discordant result between fetal karyotyping and NIPT , full karyotyping analysis of her peri pheral blood was additionally performed. Among the 178 G banded karyo types randomly selected, 173 (97.2%) were normal (46, XX), but 5 (2.8%) were abnormal (45, X), indicating that maternal mosaicism for aneuploidy could result in discordant NIPT results.

25142,"INTRODUCTION: Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a recent prenatal screening procedure that estimates the risk of several fetal cytogenetic ab errations by means of analyzing the circulating cell free fetal DNA (ccfDNA) present in maternal blood. Although NIPT have been used to mainly detect chromosomal aneuploidies such as trisomy 21, 18 or 13, the implementati on of deeper and more robust next generation sequencing (NGS) protocols and algorithms are showing that other chromosomes and genomic regions can be analyzed with a reasonable sensitivity and specifitity. METHODS: Fetal DNA was extracted from plasma obtained in a BCT DNA free tube (Streck). Library preparation and sequencing proceedings were performed according to BGI NIFTY protocol. NIFTY algorithm was used to analyze the risk for fetal trisomies and other aneuploidies. Genomic results were validated with DNA extracted from 16th gestational week amniotic fluid using a custom Agilent 60k array CGH platform designed for prenatal diagnosis. RESULTS: NIFTY algorithm informed of a high risk for duplication of the whole short arm of chromosome 12 (dup12p).

25143,"Several countries have implemented Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) to analyze chromosomal abnormalities in high risk pregnancies. The majo rity of these tests are performed using sequencing technologies that pro vide both superior specificity and sensitivity compared to traditional first trimester screening. However, in order to provide all women with high performance prenatal screening, the NIPT assay cost and complexity need to be dramatically reduced. We present a platform that reduces the cost of the analysis by an order of magnitude making the assay available for high throughput diagnostic laboratories. Our solution, called Smart NIPT technology, provides a very high assay precision by counting individual fluorescently labeled DNA molecules. The technology uses DNA probes to specifically convert chromosomal targets of interest into DNA circles. These circles are then clonally expanded into dis crete fluorescently labeled DNA objects. The DNA objects are immobilized on a transparent nanopore filter and finally imaged and counted through the bottom of the well. By capturing thousands of DNA targets from each chro mosome, PCR amplification can be avoided with increased assay precision and reduced contamination risks as a result. We applied the technology to analyze 183 blinded plasma samples of which 15 were from women pregnant with a trisomy 21 fetus. All positive samples were classified correctly, separated from the normal samples with a mini mum of 6.6 standard deviations. No false positives were called. In conclusion, the Smart NIPT platform, supported by convincing clinical data, is a new solution that holds promise to provide NIPT to all pregnant women.",2016
25144,"Nowadays, genome wide approaches are part of Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT), analyzing fetal cell free DNA (cfDNA) through a maternal blood sample. Technical issues are not the keypoint anymore. Ethical questi ons, about their large scaled implementation and potential diagnosis of sub chromosomal imbalances, do occupy a major place. Another critical issue is about unexpected finding on maternal cfDNA, which is screened altogether with fetal cfDNA, far away from the original test aim. We report the case of Mrs R., a French forty year old pregnant woman, wi thout any medical history. She underwent NIPT , prescribed because of ma ternal age in Luxembourg where she lives, and performed in Belgium. By massive parallel sequencing of cfDNA, an abnormal genome wide repre sentation profile was detected with a gain of 1q, 6p, and chromosome 15 and the loss of 13, 14 and 22q. This specific abnormalities association, remi niscent of acquired chromosomal imbalances, indicated a possible Multiple Myeloma (MM). Clinical, biological and radiological assessments confirmed a smouldering lambda type free light chain MM. Array Comparative Geno mic Hybridization and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization were performed on tumor plasma cells from bone marrow puncture : they revealed the same anomalies as those detected by NIPT .This case report reminds that global medical and ethical thinking is highly required to plan safeguards against possible abuses allowed by these new techniques. It shows the potential power of this tool, whose consequences should be anticipated so as to enrich prior information given to patients.

25145,"Objective: The clinical importance of assessing the fetal KEL genotype is to exclude Ã¢ÂÂKÃ¢ÂÂ positive fetuses (genotype KEL1/KEL2) in Ã¢ÂÂKÃ¢ÂÂ alloimmunized pregnant women (genotype KEL2/KEL2). Non invasive assessment of the fetal KEL genotype is not yet available in the Czech Republic. The aim of this study is to assess the fetal KEL1/KEL2 genotype from cell free fetal DNA in the plasma of KEL2/KEL2 pregnant women. Methods: The fetal genotype was assessed by minisequencing (a dilution series including control samples). A total of 138 pregnant women (between the 8th and the 23th gestational week) were tested by minisequencing. The fetal genotype was further verified by analysis of a buccal swab from the newborn. Results: Minisequencing proved to be a reliable method. In 2.2 % of the examined women (3/138), plasma sample testing failed; 94.8 % of wo men (128/135) had the KEL2/KEL2 genotype, and a total of 3.1 % fetuses (4/128) had the KEL1/KEL2 genotype. Sensitivity and specificity reached 100 %, p <0.0001. Conclusion: Minisequencing is a reliable method for the assessment of the fetal KEL1 allele from the plasma of KEL2/KEL2 pregnant women.

25146,"Introduction: There is a great need for the development of highly accurate, cost effective technologies, which can facilitate the widespread adoption of Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT). We hereby present a novel cost ef fective assay of unparalleled accuracy which overcomes the limitations of current technologies. Materials and Methods: This method enables the targeted analysis of selec ted genomic regions at very high sequencing depth and allows highly accu rate fetal fraction determination to ensure extremely accurate aneuploidy detection. The analytical performance of the assay was evaluated in a blind study, which comprised 631 samples derived from pregnancies of at least 10 weeks of gestation that had also undergone invasive testing. Results: The blind study exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity and correctly classified 52/52 (95% CI: 93.2 100%) cases of trisomy 21, 16/16 (95% CI: 79.4 100%) cases of trisomy 18, 5/5 (95% CI: 47.8 100%) cases of trisomy 13, and 538/538 (95% CI: 99.3 100%) normal cases. The test also correctly identified fetal sex in all cases (95% CI: 99.4 100%). One sample failed pre specified assay quality control criteria, and 19 samples were non reportable due to low fetal fraction. Conclusions: The clinical impact of free fetal DNA (ffDNA) testing has been significant as indicated by its quick adoption in prenatal care. Our novel technology overcomes limitations of current technologies and exhibits near diagnostic performance. We believe that this method enables accurate and cost effective non invasive fetal aneuploidy detection of trisomy 21, 18 and 13, which is critical for wide spread adoption of NIPT .",2016

In prenatal diagnostic, microarray analysis is considered most beneficial in pregnancies with ul trasound abnormalities. We report chromosomal abnormalities detected ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 67Back to index by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in fetuses with increased risk of common aneuploidies without ultrasound abnormalities. We focus on chromosomal abnormalities that would not be detected by non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT).Materials and Methods: We performed SNP array analysis in 358 pregnant women, who underwent chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis bet ween July 2013 and January 2016. The high risk (HR) group (n,165) inclu ded fetuses with abnormal ultrasound findings as defined by Danish Society of Fetal Medicine. The group with increased risk (IR) (n,193) consisted of fetuses without ultrasound abnormalities with risk assessment for common aneuploidies (Astraia) higher than 1/300. SNP array analyses were perfor med by using Illumina CytoSNP 12 version 2.1. Results: Abnormal SNP array results were more prevalent in the HR group 14.5% (n,24) compared with IR group 5.7% (n,11) (p value 0.007). Within the IR group, nine cases were evaluated as pathogenic. Four of the nine pa thogenic chromosomal abnormalities detected by SNP array, would not be detected by NIPT or other diagnostic methods (aneuploidy screening, tradi tional karyotyping). However, all four conditions resulting from these chro mosomal abnormalities are known to have variable penetrance. Conclusions: In comparison with NIPT , SNP array can potentially identify additional genetic abnormalities in fetuses with increased risk of common aneuploidies without ultrasound abnormalities. However, the variable pe netrance of the additionally detected chromosomal abnormalities by SNP array makes genetic counseling challenging.",2016
25148,"Thalassaemias, the most common genetic disorders worldwide, are inheri ted in a recessive autosomal manner. Therefore, prenatal diagnosis of em bryos at risk presents the most common method of disease prevention and is predominantly based on genetic analysis of cells of fetal origin. This mate rial is mainly obtained through invasive procedures with 1 2% probability of miscarriage. Therefore, non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) approaches, based on analyzing fetal DNA circulating in the maternal plasma, were de veloped. Here, we present a novel approach for detecting beta globin gene mutations present in free fetal DNA (ffDNA). This method is based on High Resolution Melting (HRM) combined with quantitative analysis.ffDNA was isolated from maternal serum (Qiamp method) and screened for the presence of ÃÂ² globin gene parental mutations based on an in house HRM developed approach. In addition, previously described SNPs in the vicinity of ÃÂ² globin gene, for which parents presented distinct haplotypes, were also determined. Preliminary results from 12 cases of male embryos carrying the paternal mutation succeeded in obtaining the same diagnosis with the preceded ana lysis of corresponding chorionic villus sampling. Interestingly, the presence of SRY gene was clearly detected in mixtures of 0,5% of male with female genomic DNA while ffDNA is estimated to be no less than 3% of the maternal free DNA. The described approach may be directly applied for NIPT of cases where the embryo is male and has inherited the paternal ÃÂ² globin gene mutation.

25149,"Background: NIPT for aneuploidies is extremely efficient, particularly for trisomy 21(t21) and t18, with sensitivity and specificity >99%. Clinical uti lization of NIPT has grown rapidly. Patients and methods: In our referral center, women undergo NIPT for sev eral indications. We describe performance in 3 cases. Three rare aneuploidies were diagnosed combining NIPT (USA based labo ratories), karyotyping. First case: 42 year old woman , integrated first second trimester screen ing: high t18 risk. Ultrasound: atrioventricular septal defect and hydrone phrosis. NIPT: high t18 probability. Second case: 36 year old primigravida, IVF ICSI pregnancy, mildly in creased nuchal translucency. NIPT: normal male. Later sonogram demon strated thickened nuchal fold. Third case: 28 year old, normal first, second trimester screening. 15 week ultrasound: cardiac echogenic focus and choroid plexus cyst. NIPT: t21.Results: First case: declined invasive testing, at delivery baby showed mi nor t18 signs, however lacked classic features. Neonate died of respiratory complications at 3 weeks. Cord blood karyotype: 46,XX,der(14)t(14;18)(p10;q10) (Partial t18). Second case: Karyotype and CMA (amniocytes): atypical Klinefelter syn drome, with isochromosome X. Third case: amniocyte QF PCR: normal, however, full karyotyping: low level t21 mosaicism (50%). Conclusions: Many factors limit NIPT accuracy. One main limitation is ge netic discrepancy between fetal and placenta tissue. This is true in simple aneuploidies, moreover in incomplete/mosaic trisomies. In the first case, although chromosome 18 only partially duplicated, it was correctly identified by NIPT .However, rare isochromosome Xq Klinefelter induced false negative NIPT , consistent with lower performance of NIPT for detection of rare sex aneu ploidies. Xq duplication probably causes even lower detection rate than complete duplication. For low level mosaicism, NIPT detected a level of mosaicism of t21, below QF PCR detection threshold. These unusual cases are examples that demonstrate NIPT strengths and weaknesses.",2016

Introduction: Recently, non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been pro posed to be a powerful alternative to screening of aneuploidy with its high sensibility and specificity. However, there is a small chance of false posi tive results due to placental mosaicism. Methods: A 31 year old women went for NIPT at 19 weeks of gestation. The positive NIPT result was noted and Z socre value was 7.36 for chromosome 13. After informing the elevated risk for fetal trisomy 13, the pregnant wom an accepted invasive diagnosis by amniocentesis to confirm the result. Am niotic fluid cells were used for karyotyping by GTG banding and oligo array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).Results: The karyotype was 46,XY and aCGH result showed arr[hg19] (1 22) x2, (X)x1, (Y)x1 on amniocentesis for the fetus. Following an abnormal NIPT result, both of the karyotype and aCGH genotype were inconsistent. Then the case underwent genotyping for the placenta and cord blood after child birth. Interesting, the genotype was arr[hg19] 13q12.11q34 (20,407,324 115,092,619)x3, (X)x1, (Y)x1 which is compatible with trisomy 13 for pla centa, and had normal genotype for cord blood. Conclusion: The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommended that abnormal NIPT results should be confirmed by invasive procedures. This study show a false positive NIPT finding due to confined placental mosaicism because the fetal cell free DNA present in maternal plasma is mainly derived from placenta.",2016

PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF are the genes responsible for this syndrome, in which genetically heterogeneity is considered. PTPN11 gene mutation is seen approximately in 50% of the patients. Although fertility seems normal in females, males have decreased fertility. The incidence of undescended testes (UT) ranges between 60 77% that is the most responsible cause of impaired male fertility.

25153,"One of the most problematic findings in prenatal chromosomal studies is the presence of non hereditary small supernumerary marker chromosomes. It is common practice to identify the status of these chromosomes by perfor ming routine C and NOR banding.

Overall we have done it for eleven samples in the past two years. All eleven had markers that were not present in chromosomal study of either parent, the presence of genomic material was hard to detect and would fall into the category of sSMCs. In all these cases the sSMC was present in more than 15% of the studied cells.

Conservative structure of the AP genes comprises promoter, 9 exons and 8 introns named A H. The aim was to identify unknown nucleotide sequences of the PAG L gene family in the human genome. Material and Methods: Human gDNA templates (N,6) were isolated from leucocytes. The gDNA templates were used for PCR of the PAG L sequence with primers that should amplify the region from 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR to exon 2 (with exon 1and intron A), according to AP gene structures(769 1556 bp). After electrophoresis and UV visualization, dominant amplicons (approx. 700bp) were gel out purified, precipitated and sequenced in both directions. All chromatograms were analyzed with Geneious software. Obtained gDNA se quences were compared to PAG L cDNAs identified by NGS (Illumina).Results: Sequencing of amplicons (197 680bp) permitted to identify novel sequence of the human PAG L (named hPAG L). This region of exon 1 re vealed homology (88 99%) only to the pepsinogen family (especially PepA) in the primates. The identified sequence of the entire intron A (486bp) shared high homology (72 100%) to different gDNA clones of homo sapiens and PepA in some other mammals, including 76% homology (exon 1) and 51%homology (intron A) to the porcine PAG2 gene. Conclusions: This is the first report describing sequence identification of the hPAG L/PepA gene fragment (exon 1 and intron A).

Currently, the service uses an array CGH platform to detect imbalances, hy bridising DNA derived from embryo biopsies against Promega DNA as a re ference sample, prepared in the same way as the biopsy. As only a few cells are biopsied, whole genome amplification is required to generate sufficient detectable signal; however, this introduces noise, which is compounded by differences between quality and nature of biopsy and reference material. We have developed the embryo versus embryo algorithm (EvE) which enables the use of an in silico reference, and removes the need to prepare a reference sample for each embryo, significantly reducing labour and con sumable costs. Method: Two embryos are hybridised to an array. EvE takes the fluorescence intensity data for each embryo and for a stored reference embryo and per forms an in silico hybridisation, which can be analysed within standard ar ray CGH analysis software. Results: EvE was validated by retrospective analysis of 74 abnormal em bryos. Subsequently, EvE was trialled prospectively for three months (46 embryos). Overall, EvE demonstrated sensitivity >99% (95% CI 97.6 100) and specificity >99% (95% CI 98.4 100).Conclusions: We have validated and successfully completed a prospective trial using EvE for chromosome rearrangement PGD, which increases effici ency and reduces costs for this test.

25157,"Introduction: Complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) are very rare in humans. In three breaking point translocations the hexavalent meiotic configuration allows four patterns of segregation: 3:3, 4:2, 5:1 and 6:0. 64 different gametic chromosomal combinations can arise of which only 2 are normal/balanced. Carriers have an increased risk of producing embryos with unbalanced karyotype. PGD enables the selection of balanced/normal embryos for transfer, enhancing the possibility for a healthy child. Materials and methods: A couple suffered from two early miscarriages. The woman was found to carry CCR:46,XX,t(3;6;7)(3pterÃ¢ÂÂ3q13.2::7p22Ã¢ÂÂ7pter;6pterÃ¢ÂÂ6q21::3q13.2Ã¢ÂÂ3qter;7qterÃ¢ÂÂ7p22::6q21Ã¢ÂÂ6qter). Her first cousin had the same translocation. The couple went through stimulated and Natural Cycle IVF. Embryo biopsy was carried out on Day 5, collecting 5 7 trophectoderm cells. The cells were am plified by whole genome amplification through SurePlex. The amplification products were processed by 24sure+ microarrays (Illumina) and analyzed by BlueFuseMulti software. Results: In total 36 ova were retrieved and two ICSI PGD procedures were performed. From the first cycle 9 ova were aspirated and 4 embryos were biopsied, none was normal/balanced. The second ICSI PGD procedure has started with 27 eggs, 11 embryos were biopsied. We found three normal/balanced embryos. Two were transferred on Day 6 after fertilization. The third normal/balanced embryo was frozen for future transfer. The women conceived with one embryo.

However, in familial gross deletions, primarily diagnosed by MLPA or SNP arrays, the exact breakpoints location is unknown and identifying the deleted region is challenging. Aim: To present an effective and simple protocol to detect gross deletions in PGD by amplifying junction fragments. Methods: Four couples carrier of gross deletions in chromosomes 11, 16, FANCA and MSH2 opted for PGD. Deletions ranged between 6 241kbp. In order to confine the junction fragments 6 25 primers, flanking the deleted regions, were purchased. The closest primers were designed 500bp from the positive probe/ SNP , followed by several primers in a similar distance. Following amplification of a junction fragment, ampliconsÃ¢ÂÂ sizes were re stricted by moving toward the breakpoints. Results: In 3 cases we managed to create a junction fragment and applied it to PGD. Amplification failure in one case was due to extended duplication regions homologues to the deletion. Six PGD cycles were performed. One couple with deletion in chromosome 16 achieved pregnancy and another couple with simultaneous detection of 2 FANCA mutations and HLA matching has delivered one healthy child and BMT was performed successfully. Discussion: For maximal accuracy in PGD,direct detection of mutations along with haplotype analysis is required.

The FMR1 intermediate (35 54 CGGs) and premutation (55 200 CGGs) alleles have been related with the development of this condition. The FMR2 alleles with 11 or less CCG repeats are also a possible genetic cause of POI. A group of 68 women with ovarian dysfunction of unknown etiology, divided into three groups concerning their ovarian condition, and 47 con trol women from the Basque Country were analyzed. The FMR1 gene, in cluding the length of the repeat and the AGG interspersion pattern, and the number of CCG repeats of the FMR2 gene were evaluated. Considering the FMR1 gene, the frequency of alleles with 35 200 CGG repeats was statisti cally higher in the patient group and in the three subgroups. Moreover, these alleles appeared to have two interruptions, the first AGG located in the 10th position and more than 15 CGG at the 3Ã¢ÂÂ end with the predominant structure 9+9+n. The patient group presented, in general, more unstable alleles and therefore the FMR1 gene appeared to play a role in the etiology of POI in the patient group.

25162,"Introduction: A 31 year old woman was referred to our center at 20 weeks of gestation because of a male fetus presented congenital heart defect, left isomerism and ventriculomegaly. No consanguinity was reported but as fa mily history, her brother and a maternal uncle had mental retardation of unknown cause and similar physical characteristics. Methodology: Genetic prenatal studies performed in the fetus (karyotype and CGH array) were normal. The differential diagnosis of the fetus was in terpreted not only based in the autopsy findings but also mental retardation present in the two males. PQBP1, an X linked gene, was considered to be a potential candidate cause. Sanger sequencing of the coding region of PQBP1 (six exons, GenBank accession no. NM_005710.2) as well as the flanking in tronic sequences were performed from fetal genomic DNA and after in DNA of the consultant, her brother, mother, maternal uncle and aunt. Results: A 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR mutation (c. 20A>C; NG_015967.1:g.5579A>C) was identi fied in the fetus, the patient, her mother and both males affected with men tal retardation. The mutation identified was not described before in the scientific literature. It is considered as possible pathogenic because its location in the promoter region of the gene could affect the transcription/ traduction of the protein. Apart from cognitive impairment, physical similarities were found in both males. All these features are described in patients with other PQBP1 mu tations. Conclusions: PQBP1 should be considered as a candidate to study when an X linked unknown cause of mental retardation is associated with clinical features such as isomerism, short stature and microcephaly.",2016

However, limited publications pre clude evaluation of parameters (assisted reproduction, embryology, gene tic probability) influencing positive outcomes: donor live born babies and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This retrospective mul ticentre cohort study, co ordinated by the ESHRE PGD Consortium, aims to address this. In 2014, 30 PGD centres with published/known PGD HLA activity were invited to participate. Fourteen centres submitted data bet ween February September 2015, using a custom designed secure database (Redcap).

25164,"Premature ovarian failure is the endpoint of premature ovarian insufficien cy (POI) and represents the complete loss of ovarian function. Although POI is a multifactorial condition, the existence of familial cases shows that it can be inherited as the result of a genetic defect. The genetic analysis of families, particularly very informative consanguineous families, is therefore invalu able to identify genes involved in the pathology. We analysed two consanguineous families from Middle East, respective ly with 4 and 2 affected sisters. Combining linkage analysis, homozygosi ty mapping and exome sequencing, we identified in the first family a 1 bp deletion in the STAG3 gene, leading to a truncated coding sequence. STAG3 encodes a meiotic component of the synaptonemal complex, a ring that ent raps sister chromatids and is required for proper pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. STAG3 loss of function as the cause of POI was confirmed by the Stag3 deficient mouse model, in which both sexes were infertile due to loss of germ cells and degenerative gonads. In the second fa mily, this approach highlighted a premature stop codon in MCM9, encoding the minichromosome maintenance complex component 9, recently implica ted in POI associated with short stature. Furthermore, Mcm9 deficient mice were sterile with empty ovaries. Therefore, our results provided the first confirmation of the implication of MCM9 mutations in POI, expanding the phenotypic spectrum to females with normal height. The genetic analysis of consanguineous families combining linkage analysis and exome sequencing is a powerful way to unravel genetic etiologies, espe cially in highly heterogeneous conditions such as POI.",2016
25165,"Introduction: Recent developments in genomics and the wealth of data ac cumulated from the application of various diagnostic molecular approaches in prenatal diagnosis, combined with the advent of novel non invasive pre natal screening tests (NIPT), have introduced new challenges in this highly sensitive field. We provide a perspective of prenatal diagnosis derived from a single centerÃ¢ÂÂs evolving experience from more than 90,000 consecutive prenatal cases and we highlight important issues and current dilemmas. Materials and Methods: Prenatal cases were referred for various indications and more than 90,000 clinical investigations were performed by a combina tion of standard karyotype, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplifica tion (MLPA), standalone array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and exome sequencing. Results: Classic karyotype revealed 1.7% and 7.9% of pathological cases in amniotic fluid and CVS samples, respectively, common aneuploidies ac counting for 59.6% and 64.3% of the total abnormal. Molecular approaches increased the diagnostic yield by 0.6% for MLPA and 1.6% for aCGH, unco vering pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities undetectable by karyotype analysis. Finally, exome sequencing provided a further beneficial increase in our diagnostic capabilities. Conclusions: Current molecular diagnostic capabilities and the recent in troduction of NIPT point to one current major dilemma in prenatal diagno sis, with serious implications in genetic counseling of parents, relating on the one hand to reaping the benefits from the high detection rate afforded through new powerful diagnostic techniques, but accepting an invasive risk, and, on the other hand, offering a lower detection rate practically for Down syndrome only, with minimal invasive risk.",2016
25166,"r.o., Praha, Czech Republic. Walker Warburg syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive inherited condi tion characterised by brain and eye abnormalities and severe congenital muscular dystrophy. Most of affected individuals die before the third year of age. Disorder is caused by mutations in several different genes, one of them is ISPD gene. Our patients are two unrelated young women of Roma origin. Both of them were referred to genetic examination because of ultrasound detection of hy drocephalus of foetus in the second trimester of gravidity. Diagnosis was also confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Both women decided to ter minate their pregnancy. Karyotype of both foetuses was normal, but Array CGH identified homozygous a 290kb deletion of ISPD gene at chromosome 7, which is one of causes of Walker Warburg syndrome. Mothers and their partners are heterozygous carriers of this deletion. Genetic counselling was provided in affected families. They were informed about possibility of assi sted reproduction and PGD and about possibility of early prenatal detection of Walker Warburg syndrome from CVS. Unfortunately, in the subsequent gravidity of both our patients the foetal hydrocephalus was again confirmed in the second trimester. The overall incidence of Walker Warburg syndrome is unknown, but for example in the Ashkenazi Jewish population it is 1 in 60500 with frequen cy of heterozygous carriers 1 in 149. There is no study about frequency of Walker Warburg syndrome in Roma population. Walker Warburg syndrome should be considered in a differential diagnosis of prenatal detected hydrocephaly and it would be useful to assess frequen cy of ISPD gene deletion in Roma population.",2016
25167,"In the UK, karyotype analysis of couples with recurrent miscarriage has been replaced by genetic investigation of POCs and fetal tissues. As a con sequence, sample numbers for these tissues have increased by 69% in our laboratory since 2012. We have replaced karyotype/MLPA testing of mis carriage products with QF PCR for chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y, followed in the case of normal results by aCGH. All array imbalances >1Mb and any fully penetrant clinically significant array imbalances <1Mb are reported. In an 18 month period, 1391 samples were tested using this approach. 25.9% of samples were found to be abnormal on QF PCR and aCGH identified a further 9.4% of samples with clinically significant imba lance, giving an overall abnormality rate of 35.3%. The initial QF PCR test is rapid, cost effective and clinically indicated, detecting triploidy (4%) and maternal cell contamination in addition to the common aneuploidies. The aCGH analysis approach minimises the number of unknown and reduced penetrance CNVs that are reported; 0.7% of samples were reported to have an imbalance of uncertain clinical significance. Overall, our QF PCR/aCGH strategy has a lower failure rate and higher detection rate than karyotype or MLPA strategies. Detection of chromosome imbalance provides reasons for pregnancy loss and fetal abnormalities, minimising further investigations and informing risk of recurrence of both miscarriage and fetal abnormality.",2016
25168,"In April 2011 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) published new recommendations for investigation and treatment of couples with recurrent miscarriages; cytogenetic analysis should now be performed on products of conception rather than the coupleÃ¢ÂÂs blood samples. Inheri tance studies are only recommended if an unbalanced structural chromoso mal abnormality is detected in the products of conception. These recommendations were implemented in the SE Thames region in April 2012.We experienced an increase in the total number of products of concepti on samples from 2011/12 to 2012/13 (42.3%) and a further increase from 2012/13 to 2013/14 (18.4%), with concomitant increase of products with sample quality insufficient for analysis. Gestation was given for 1126 (61%) samples; the first trimester samples increased from 109 in 2011/12 (39.4%) to 181 in 2012/13 (51%) to 239 in 2013/14 (52.1%).

The aim of this work was investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphism on p53, IL 11, IL 10, VEGF and APOE have a higher prevalence among women with a history of recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and pregnancy loss (RPL).MATERIAL AND METHODS: SNPs genotyping (rs1042522 p53 R72P; rs1800896 IL 111082AG; rs1570360 VEGF 1154AG; rs11668344 IL 10; rs429358 APOE R112C; rs7412 APOE R158C) using TaqMan assays has been studied in 255 women. The control group included 89 oocyte donors. In the study group included 166 women: 77 with RIF and 89 with RPL. RIF was defined as a total of four transferred cleaved good quality embryos with negative hCG. RPL was defined as two or more miscarriages. RESULTS: The frequency of P72/P72 genotypes on p53 gene among women experiencing RIF was 9.5% compared with 13.5% for those with a history of RPL and 6% in controls (p<0.05). The frequency of E4 isoform on APOE gene among RIF was 18.6% compared with 28.9% for those with RPL and 13.5% in controls (p<0.05). A tendency between the frequency of genotypes distribution with respect to VEGF and IL 11 was shown with no statistical significance difference. As for IL 10 no differences were reported. CONCLUSION: This investigation reveals that in RIF and RPL patients P72 on p53 gene and E4 isoform on APOE are more prevalent than fertile popu lation. This information together with some additional markers will allow developments of diagnostic tests for detect risk for RIF and RPL before in fertility treatment is initiated.",2016
25170,"There are more than 450 skeletal dysplasias ranging in severity and degree of associated complications, and although individually rare, collectively they have a birth incidence of around 1 in 5000. Prenatal diagnosis is often prompted by the finding of short long bones on ultrasound scanning or in cases with a family history of skeletal dysplasias. Specific diagnosis can be difficult and relies on clinical, radiological and molecular criteria. Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of cranial sutures, has a prevalence of 1 in 2000 and around 15% of these are syndromic and associated with other anomalies. Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis of craniosynostosis can be difficult and so a definite diagnosis relies on DNA testing. The use of fetal MRI and CT scan imaging has advantages over ultrasound imaging and can provide excellent tissue resolution and a greater field of view. Detailed imaging allows for a clear differential diagnosis to be esta blished as early as possible, enabling further investigations such as mole cular diagnostic testing to be considered. This can allow for the distinction between lethal and non lethal dysplasias, and permit further discussions with parents around prognosis and management. We report 4 prenatal cases of Saethre Chotzen and Carpenter syndromes, Hypochondrogenesis, and Metatropic dysplasia with their clinical, radio logical and molecular features. We show the first UK case where fetal CT scan was performed as well as MRI images. The findings demonstrate the importance of fetal imaging in helping to reach a prenatal diagnosis and the impact it has on subsequent clinical management.",2016
25171,"Background: Chromosome microarray analysis can identify submicroscopic genomic imbalances that may not be detectable by karyotyping. Because of this increased yield, microarray analysis is emerging as a first line test for prenatal diagnosis in pregnancies with fetal anomalies or with invasive te sting for another indications. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays offer the ability to detect copy neural chromosomal aberrati ons such as uniparental disomy and absence of heterozygosity. Our centre offers combined rapid aneuploidy screening, by quantitative fluorescence PCR (QF PCR), with SNP array as a first line test in women undergoing inva sive prenatal testing. Report: We describe a consanguineous couple, known to be carriers for a recessive disease by family history, presenting with mul tiple fetal abnormalities at 12 weeks gestation. The fetal abnormalities were not in keeping with disease known to segregate within this family. Combined aneuploidy screening performed on chorionic villus sampling was suggesti ve of monosomy 21. SNP array subsequently demonstrated normal chro mosome copy number and near complete absence of heterozygosity (AOH) of chromosome 21. Further testing revealed homozygous mutations in the MKS1 gene known to cause Meckel Gruber Syndrome. Discussion: The initi al QF PCR result of monosomy 21 would have predicted a low recurrence risk for this family. SNP array demonstrated a significant proportion of the genome with AOH. This information, along with the findings from additio nal molecular testing identified that this couple was a carrier for a second recessive disease. The combination of both tests allowed for more accurate counselling in this and future pregnancies. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 73Back to index",2016

In 2004 Roscioli et al. characterized a large autosomal dominant pedigree segregating split hand/foot linked to chromosome 10q24. Since then postnatal cases with duplication of this region and SHFM phenotype have been described. Herein we present for the first time two prenatal cases of a de novo interstitial duplication of 10q24.32 and SHFM. Materials and Methods: In both cases amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks gestation, due to the presence of fetal SHFM, detected by ultrasound scan. Chromosome analyses were performed on cultured amniotic cells at approximately 350 band resolution. Array CGH was performed using com mercially available array (CytoSure, OGT , UK). Confirmatory FISH analyses were performed in cultured amniotic cells and peripheral blood lympho cytes from parents, using BAC clone specific for the 10q24.32 region. Results: G band chromosome analyses revealed normal karyotypes, where as the array CGH detected duplication at chromosome 10q24. In the com mon duplicated region 3 genes are mapped: BTRC, POLL and FBXW4, the results were confirmed by FISH. Conclusions: The detailed second trimester ultrasound scan can detect ma jor fetal malformations and is offered for routine prenatal care. Array CGH allowed a precise chromosomal diagnosis, confirming this analysis as a first tier approach to clarify molecular bases of fetal malformations.

25173,"ShterevÃ¢ÂÂ, Sofia, Bulgaria. Spontaneous abortions, defined as embryonic or fetal loss before 20 weeks of gestation, occur at a frequency of 10 15% of confirmed pregnancies. Establishing their etiology is essential for proper clinical decision in each case. About 10% of women with one miscarriage are at risk of recurrent spontaneous abortions, which is a great physical and emotional burden. The most common causes of this condition are fetal genetic abnormalities. In the present study we performed whole genome analysis by array CGH in 10 abortive tissues. We detected the following genomic anomalies: 2 cases with 47,XÃÂ£ , +22 [arr(22)x3]; 1 case with 47,XÃÂ¥, +20 [arr(20)x3], 47, XY, +16 [arr(16)x3] and 46,XY,arr(7p)x3. Since the last case represents a structural aberration we assumed a carriership of balanced chromosomal aberration and performed cytogenetic analysis of the parents. The karyotype of the mo ther showed balanced translocation with breakpoints 7q11 and 10p13 46, XX, t(7;10)(q11;p13), explaining the observed fetal anomaly. Based on this result we performed preimplantation diagnostics in the family using array CGH and only balanced embryo was transferred. The patient has successful ongoing pregnancy. Conclusion: We detected chromosomal aberrations in 50% of the analyzed cases. Among them were present both frequent (such as trisomy 16 and 22) and less common (trisomy 20) anomalies. The structural anomaly re vealed constitutional aberration which needs PGD for patientÃ¢ÂÂs safety and successful pregnancy. We conclude that genomic analysis is an effective tool in the complex diagnostic approach in spontaneous abortions and could be first line analysis with grate impact on decision making.",2016

In both cases origin and mechanism of non disjunction was elucida ted by the QF PCR .The first pregnancy of unrelated healthy parents (25 and 24 years) was referred to invasive prenatal diagnosis due to significant aneuploidy risk calculated from multi marker screening results in 2010. Diagnostic procedure was declined by the family and the newborn karyotype was 46,XX,+21,der(21;21)(q10;q10). Both parental karyotypes were normal (46,XX and 46,XY). QF PCR using peripheral blood of the newborn proved maternal origin of trisomy with non disjunction in meiosis I.

We report on a healthy 38 year old G2P1 woman who underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 14 weeks of gestation because she presented an abnormal first trimester maternal serum screening (1/196). A non mosaic 47,XX,+2 karyotype was found on direct cytogenetic analysis and on long term CVS culture. Amnio centesis was performed at 16 weeks of gestation. FISH analysis on uncultu red amniocytes revealed the trisomy 2 at a non significant level. However, conventional cytogenetic and FISH studies on cultured amniocytes detected mosaic trisomy 2 in two independent cultures. Detailed ultrasonographic examination at 18 weeks of gestation showed an eutrophic fetus, without malformation. The patient declined the option to conduct a fetal ultrasound follow up and decided to terminate the pregnancy. Genetic counseling for mosaic trisomy 2 remains delicate because of the rarity of published cases and the difficulty to determine if the trisomy in volves fetal tissues or only the amniotic epithelium. Moreover, it has been established that presence of autosomal trisomy in amnion correlates with poor outcome even when the fetus appears to carry only diploid cells. To date, 19 cases of mosaic trisomy 2 detected by amniocentesis have been reported. Of these, 10 cases were associated with prominent phenotypic ab normalities.

The patients were catego rized into ethnic groups based on their origin of birth and spoken language in three male generations namely Azeri, Fars, Kurd, Gilak/Mazani, Lor and Arab. Results: Among 3636 infertile men, 177 cases of Yq microdeletions (4.8%) were diagnosed, including 60 from Azeri origin (33.8%), 55 from Fars origin (31%), 23 from Kurd origin (12.9%), 10 from Gilak/Mazani (5.6%), 18 from Lor origin (10.1%), and 2 from the Arab origin (1.1%). There were also 6 cases of non Iranian (Afghan & Iraqi) origin. In 177 Iranian infertile men with AZF microdeletions we detected 157 microdeletions in AZFc (70%), 57 in AZFb (25.4 %) and 10 in AZFa (4.6%) regions.

Materials and methods: Fibroblast samples from patients carrying the ABCA4 variant c.5461 10T>C were analyzed by isolating total RNA, follo wed by RT PCR using specific primers spanning the variant. For detection of ABCA4 protein, fibroblast samples were lysed and analyzed by SDS PAGE followed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal ABCA4 antibody. Results: The ABCA4 variant c.5461 10T>C causes a splicing defect resulting in reduction of full length mRNA in cells from patients and the presence of alternative spliced mRNAs where exon 39 40 is skipped. The splicing defect is causing a reduced level of full length ABCA4 protein compared to controls not carrying the variant.

After filtering SNPs displaying extreme imbalanced allelic ratios, that are defined as lower than 0.3 and higher than 3.4 based on top 5% values, we validated heterozygosity by Sanger sequencing and AEI by pyrosequencing. Our RNA Seq results revealed that among 301 known retinal disease genes, 64 sho wed evidence for AEI. CDHR1 and EMC1, displaying some of the highest AEI frequencies (100% and 67% respectively), have already been positively va lidated by pyrosequencing. In both cases AEI is a feature exclusively present in specific gene isoforms. Comparative sequencing revealed an intronic SNP , rs4562752, strongly associated with AEI in CDHR1 002. In silico analysis predicts an impact of this variant on splice site selection and thus, explains the AEI observed for this isoform. Our results indicate that allelic transcrip tional alterations caused by cis eQTLs can indeed be traced by RNA Seq ana lysis. Validation of further relevant retinal genes is still ongoing.

25182,"Introduction: Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with aminoglycoside induced hearing impairment (AIHI). However, in many studies only MTRNR1 gene is analyzed. We performed whole mtDNA se quencing for identification of known and novel AIHI mutations, mtDNA het eroplasmy assessment and haplotype prediction. Materials and Methods: Hearing impairment patients with aminoglycoside exposure history (n,130) and normal hearing controls treated with ami noglycosides without ototoxic effect (n,100) were enrolled into the study. All participants were Caucasian. MtDNA was enriched by long range PCR and sequenced. MToolBox was used for haplogroup assignment, functional and prioritization analysis of identified variants, and heteroplasmy fraction assessment. Results: Mean coverage per mtDNA genome was >1000x in each subject. We found homoplasmic AIHI m.1555A>G mutation in MTRNR1 (5/130) and several putative AIHI related candidates, including m.7445A>G in MTTS1 precursor (1/130, familial case) previously not associated with AIHI. Het eroplasmy analysis trough the whole mtDNA genome and haplotype predic tion revealed higher heteroplasmy frequency in HI patients and recurrent haplotypes not observed in control subjects (H7c 3/130, HV10 2/130, R0a 3/130, W3a 3/130, W6a 2/130). We also identified patient harbor ing low level heteroplasmy of m.3243A>G mutation in MTTL1 associated with MELAS syndrome. This mutation was missed in previous Sanger se quencing screening and patient was misclassified to our AIHI group. Conclusions: NGS technology is a powerful tool for mtDNA analysis in AIHI patients allowing for known and novel mutations detection. Heteroplasmy frequency and specific haplogroups observed in AIHI patients may be an ad ditional factors modifying personal susceptibility to AIHI.

Introduction: Aniridia is a rare, bilateral, congenital ocular disorder causing incomplete formation of the iris, usually characterized by iris aplasia/hypo plasia. In the majority of cases, it is caused by mutation in the PAX6 gene, but it can also be caused by microdeletions that involve the 11p13 region. One third of cases are sporadic and result from de novo mutations. Materials and methods: We tested 6 patients with aniridia (full and partial forms), glaucoma and myopathia, and 1 patient with dysgenesis mesoder malis oculi with SNP microarray Illumina Human CoreExome 12.Results: Aberrations were observed in 4 patients. Two patients with full ani ridia were found to harbor heterozygous deletion in 11p13 sized 167.108 kb encompassing genes PAX6 and ELP4. One patient with partial aniridia had loss of heterozygosity in part of 20p11.1p11.21 sized 1.266678 Mb, contai ning VSX1 gene. VSX1 mutations have been previously reported in patients with abnormalities of the anterior segment and keratoconus. A heterozy gous deletion in 6q22.31q22.32 sized 659.704 kb., including genes: HEY2; NCOA7; HINT3 was found in one patient with dysgenesis mesodermalis ocu li. Gene HEY2 is involved in the signal transduction pathway of PAX6, FOXC1 and PITX2 genes, associated with the disease. Conclusion: In our study of patients with eye disorders we found in additi on to a microdeletion of PAX6, two new deletions encompassing HEY2 and VSX1 genes.",2016
25183,"Molecular genetic analysis of a family with apparent X linked inheritance of CORD was performed in order to establish the cause of visual impairment. Negative mutation screening of X linked genes RPGR and RP2 in the male proband was followed by WES which revealed possible compound heterozy gous mutations in two autosomal candidate genes: CERKL and CRB1. Segregation analysis in the extended pedigree demonstrated the proband and his affected brother were compound heterozygotes for the CERKL va riants, ENST00000410087:c.[863_864del];[1160 1G>A] that could account for their condition, however the CRB1 variants were both on the same (ma ternal) haplotype, CRB1 :ENST00000367399:c.[exon2:493_501del;exon4:1 024G>A]. An affected male cousin did not inherit either CERKL variant, but had inherited the variant CRB1 haplotype. The cause of his condition was therefore unresolved. Sanger sequencing of the coding regions of CRB1 in this individual did not reveal any additional mutations in other CRB1 exons, however, cloning and sequencing of exon 2 revealed a heterozygous frames hift deletion ENST00000367399:c.[613_619del] on the paternally derived haplotype, that had been masked by the deletion variant of the maternally derived haplotype. The phenotype in the cousin was therefore caused by compound heterozygous mutations of CRB1 . Our analysis has identified novel disease causing compound heterozygous variants in CERKL and CRB1 and shows two autosomal recessive retinal dis orders masquerading as an X linked condition in this pedigree, thus creating issues for genetic counselling. This illustrates the importance of segregation analysis in the extended family for the successful interpretation of WES data. This work was supported by Moorfields Special Trustees.

25184,"The numbers of reported pathogenic variants causing genetic disorders have increased dramatically since Next Generation Sequencing has beco me available. The Middle Eastern population, known to exhibit high rates of consanguinity and comprised of isolated ethnic groups, has contributed dramatically to the discovery of pathogenic variants causing deafness. We applied targeted genomic enrichment (TGE), along with massively paral lel sequencing (MPS), of 284 genes on unrelated Middle Eastern families. Our results doubled the number of genes associated with deafness in this population. A number of these required functional validation to determine the consequences of the variants. One of these was a synonymous alteration located in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ splice site of the MYO15A gene. Our challenge was to prove the consequences of this variant, since we could not check the splicing in the patientÃ¢ÂÂs RNA, due to the inaccessibility of human inner ear tissue and lack of MYO15A expression in lymphoblasts. As a result, a functional spli cing assay was performed to determine the consequences of the variant on splicing. Due to the high GC content surrounding the splice site, we created a modified human cell line expressing the wild type and mutant forms of the genomic region. Our results indicate that the mutation abolishes intron retention, an event that is likely to be a functional alternative splicing event. Considering the importance of providing evidence for pathogenic variants, our study demonstrates the use of a robust tool for investigating splicing variants, particularly for genes expressed in inaccessible tissues.

25185,"Introduction. CEP290 is pivotal in the assembly/maintenance of primary and motile cilia in a wide range of cell systems. Biallelic CEP290 mutati ons cause a wide spectrum of devastating ciliopathies ranging from mono symptomatic retinal dystrophy to multi visceral sometimes embryo lethal syndromes. The CEP290 retinal disease manifests invariably as a conge nital and dramatically severe cone dominant disease with visual function reduced to light perception. Using targeted NGS in individuals with retinal dystrophies, we identified a homozygote CEP290 1pb deletion (c.1666del; p. Ile 556Phefs*17) in a 15 year old girl having a rod dominant disease with preserved cone function (visual acuity , 6/10). The present study aimed at understanding the molecular bases of this observation. Material and Methods. RT PCR, RTqPCR, Western blot and cilia analyses were performed from patient and control fibroblasts. Results. Analysis of the CEP290 mRNA in patient fibroblasts revealed low levels of an altered splice form in which exon 18 was skipped (5% of the amount of the wildtype mRNA in controls) and Western blot detected low levels of a CEP290 protein around 290 KDa. The number of patient fibro blasts producing a cilium under serum starvation was in the normal range. Conclusions. The mutation identified in the patient is predicted to encode a premature stop codon in exon 18, downstream of the 1bp deletion in exon 17. The skipping of exon 18 with the upstream 1bp deletion allows produ cing low levels of CEP290 mRNA with an intact open reading frame and of a minimally shortened protein which expression may explain the preservati on of central vision.",2016
25186,"In order to overcome the lack of knowledge on the molecular bases of com plex hearing traits (Normal Hearing Function NHF, Age Related Hearing Loss ARHL), a fruitful gene discovery strategy is proposed: new candidate genes/variants identified through GWAS/metanalysis are then validated by targeted re sequencing (TRS) and functional studies in animal models. GWAS on NHF (quantitative) and ARHL (qualitative) on 4150 subjects from different cohorts (Italian isolates, Belgium, Caucasus and Central Asia) were performed. Two strongly significant loci (p value~2e 8) were identified, one of which (top SNP:rs11520167) includes a gene causing hearing loss in mice and affecting cochlear outer hair cells. Interestingly, it is the first example of a hearing loss gene modulating NHF. To further investigate the role of candidates identified we developed a cu stom TRS panel of 46 genes and analysed ~500 ARHL patients from our cohorts. 56 mutations of interest were identified: 5 frameshift indels, 2 nonsense and 49 missense affecting 22 different genes and 128 patients. According to the complex genetic structure of ARHL, three scenarios were detected: 1)different mutations in the same gene, 2)the same mutation in different patients and 3)different mutations in the same patient. Finally ge nes were prioritised and included for expression analysis in the otic vesic le of Zebrafish larvae and for the generation of Knock Out/In models and their accurate phenotypic characterisation. Results from the first series of genes (e.g. SLC44A2 and SLC9A3R1) will be presented and discussed. These results strongly support the usefulness of our approach to detect and validate new genes involved in NHF and ARHL.",2016
25187,"Introduction: Hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory deficit and is caused by genetic, environmental or multifactorial etiologies. It traditionally presented a challenge for genetic testing due to its heterogeneity. Materials and Methods: Seventy one patients with early onset sensorineu ral hearing loss were enrolled. First Tier approach includes the study of m.1555 and m.1494 mitochondrial mutations and MLPA study for identi fication of duplications/deletions and common point mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 genes. Second Tier was performed using a custom NGS panel of 92 genes on 16 negative patients. Haloplex technology (Agilent Technologies) was used for exons and flanking intronic sequences enrichment and sequen cing was performed on a MiSeq (Illumina).Results: First tier strategy detected 1 homoplasmic m.1555 mutation in MT RNR1 gene (1,5%) and 8 pathogenic conditions in GJB2 and GJB6 genes (12%). Second tier produced a coverage of targeted exons for >20 reads of 96,3% and a mean depth coverage of 454x. By our filtering strategy, the pa tients were classified as follow: 5 resulted with a pathogenic variant (31%), 5 with uncertain variants (31%) and 6 with irrelevant findings (38%). All relevant variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and characterizati on of novel variants is in course. Conclusions: Diagnostic capacity of NGS is indubitable although the pro gressive approach presented here may be useful to maintain a cost effective strategy and to cover all the technically excluding needs (mitochondrial, lar ge copy number variants, single nucleotide variants).

However, de novo AD pathogenic variants may also be found, while syndromic features could be rather mild or even misleading during child hood. Five families from the cohort of SLC26A4/PDS negative patients with HHL ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 77Back to index compounded by inner ear abnormalities (IEA) were analysed. One family has AR , another AD trait; in three cases the occurrence of HHL was appa rently sporadic. Four cases did not have syndromic signs, while one case had a syndromic form of HHL. Extended gene panel next generation sequencing (NGS) was carried out in all studied cases (TruSight One, Illumina, USA), verified by Sanger DNA se quencing in detected variants. We have identified likely pathogenic variants in all examined families. Most commonly compound heterozygous pathogenic variants were found in MYO15A (2 families) associated with AR NSHL, while compound heterozy gous MYO7A variants linked to Usher syndrome 1B and de novo AD EYA1 and CHD7 variants causing BOR and CHARGE syndromes respectively, were observed. In conclusion, this pilot study provided evidence that the genetic aetiology of inner ear disorders is heterogeneous.

The aim of the study was to screen for POU3F4 mutations in a large group of hearing loss patients, analyze audiological and radiological features in patients with HL caused by POU3F4 defects and to present our experience on cochlear implantation in these patients. Muta tions in the POU3F4 gene were first analyzed in a selected group of pati ents with gusher or gusher like incidence (n, 26) through sequencing of the whole gene. Subsequently, the identified mutations were screened for in a cohort of two thousand males with HL The molecular techniques used to detect POU3F4 mutations included whole exome sequencing, Sanger se quencing and real time PCR. Three novel (p. Glu187*, p. Leu217*, p. Gln275*) and one known p. Ala116fs141* POU3F4 mutations were detected. One of the novel mutations was revealed to be a de novo event. All probands with POU3F4 defects suffered from bilateral prelingual severe to profound HL. Morphological changes of the temporal bone in these patients presented a similar pattern, including malformations of the internal auditory canal, ve stibular aqueduct, modiolus and vestibule. Two of the patients with POU3F4 mutations received cochlear implants with good outcome. In summary, ex tensive clinical and genetic investigations show that POU3F4 mutations fre quently occur in patients with particular temporal bone malformations.

25190,"Background:Inherited retinal diseases (IRD) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous set of disorders, for which diagnostic next generation se quencing (NGS) services have been developed worldwide. Methods:We present the molecular findings for 537 individuals referred to a 105 gene diagnostic NGS test for IRD. We assess the diagnostic yield, the spectrum of clinical referrals, the variant analysis burden, and the genetic heterogeneity of IRD. We retrospectively analyze disease causing variants, including an assessment of variant frequency in ExAC. Findings:Individuals were referred from 10 clinically distinct classifica tions of IRD. Of the 4,542 variants clinically analysed, we have reported 402 mutations as a cause or a potential cause of disease in 62 of the 105 genes surveyed. These variants account or likely account for the clinical diagno sis of IRD in 51% of the 537 referred individuals. 144 potentially disease causing mutations were identified as novel at the time of clinical analysis, demonstrating a clear advantage of diagnostic NGS approaches for IRD but also highlighting the need for further evidence to assist clinical interpreta tion. Only 15% of molecular diagnoses are accounted for by mutations in the 33 genes identified as a cause of IRD post 2005, suggesting that whilst the continued addition of new disease causing genes will of course improve diagnostic services, there is a need to survey intronic and regulatory regions of genes known as a cause of IRD.

25191,"To study the genetic basis and to identify pathogenic mechanisms of Retinal Dystrophies(RD), a total of 10 Spanish families, remaining uncharacterized by Whole Exome Sequencing(WES), were analyzed by Whole Genome Se quencing (WGS). The WGS data were processed following an expert in house in silico pipeline developed by the University of Lausanne. We were able to characterize 4 out of 10 (40%) of the families. Biallelic single nucleotide va riations (SNV), undetected by WES due to the low depth coverage of the spe cific region, were detected in an X linked Retinitis Pigmentosa and two auto somal recessive RD families with mutations in the NYX, DFNB31 and ACBD5 genes, respectively. The identification of a nonsense mutation in the NYX gene, responsible for congenital stationary night blindness, led to the reas sessment of the clinical diagnosis. Interestingly, the WGS analytical pipeline in combination with homozygosity mapping analysis were able to identify a novel homozygous mutation in the ACBD5 gene in a maternal isodisomy case, leading to a new phenotype genotype association. A combination of a non biallelic SNV and a structural variation was found in an additional arRD family. Affected members of this family were compound heterozygous for a missense variant and a ~56kb deletion involving exons 32 and 33 in the EYS gene. In this study, we show the power of WGS coupled with homozygosity mapping in solving recessive cases.

The duplication was within a 849 Kb foun der haplotype and using SNPs located on a 1Mb genomic interval including MYO15A to infer haplotypes in disease individuals and in around 2,500 healthy worldwide subjects we reconstructed a median joining network to get insights into the origins and evolutionary history of the MYO15A dupli cation. We then performed WES in 12 families out of the 18 non MYO15A mutated and identified mutations in different genes which are likely to be causative of GHL in 7/12 families with an overall diagnostic rate of 58% (15/26). In conclusion, the MYO15A duplication, found in 28% of families and with a carrier population frequency of 1%, emerges as the major cause of GHL in North Oman and the strategy described could have primary impli cations for an efficient design of GHL diagnosis in Oman.",2016
25199,"HHL is characterised by clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Here, 70 Italian and Qatari HHL families were screened by analysis of 113 HHL genes by Targeted Re Sequencing (TRS) followed, in negative cases, by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to discover HHL candidate genes and by in vitro and in vivo validation of them. Ion Torrent PGMÃ¢ÂÂ¢(4.356 amplicons ensuring approximately 92,6% cove rage of the target region) and Ion ProtonÃ¢ÂÂ¢(293.903 amplicons ensuring approximately >99% coverage of the target region) were used for TRS and WES, respectively. Genomic variants were annotated by ANNOVAR and filte red according to:a) pedigree pattern of inheritance, b) allele frequency data, c) pathogenicity prediction. Functional studies were carried out in Zebrafish (expression and generation of K/O K/I).TRS allowed us to characterise 9/25 Italian and 8/15 Qatari families (over all detection rate of 43%) while for other 30 TRS studies are in progress. As regards to WES, 19 cases entered the pipeline. Some new genes (i.e. BDP1; PSIP1) and several strong candidates (e.g. TBL1Y, PIEZO1, LAMC1, PLS1) for which final functional validation is in progress were identified. Preliminary data include: 1) expression studies for PLS1 in Zebrafish larvae revealing a strong gene expression in the hair cells of the otic vesicle; 2) RT PCR on TBLY1 showing a cochlear expression in the Human cDNA and transfection of HEK cells displayed that the mutation alters the stability of the protein itself. These findings highlight the relevance of the combined approach based on NGS and animal model validation in understanding the genetics of HHL. Updated data will be presented and discussed.",2016
25200," Introduction: Congenital eye malformations are highly heterogeneous con ditions displaying a wide spectrum of overlapping phenotypes. Mutational load is not well known due to lack of systematic molecular characterization of large cohorts. Our aim is to perform comprehensive molecular screen ing for eye developmental causal genes using a next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel. Methods: 82 uncharacterized patients with several ocular phenotypes (A/M, aniridia, ocular coloboma, anterior segment dysgenesis and nerve optic malformations) were analysed. Six positive cases carrying previously known mutations or CNVs were included for validation. A custom targeted enrichment system for 121 genes was used, followed by sequencing on Illu mina platforms. Sanger validation and custom Agilent CGH arrays were used to validate candidate variants and CNVs, respectively. Results: Currently we have findings for 44 patients. Targeted NGS identi fied pathogenic mutations or novel potentially damaging variants in 44% of patients. After segregation analysis and phenotyping, we characterized the 30% of cases, mainly those suffering from A/M. A total of 19 different causal mutations, being 63% of them novel, were found in 17 genes. Complete het erozygous deletion of OTX2 and SIX6 was also been identified by NGS in a patient with syndromic bilateral anophthalmia. Further aCGH analysis con firmed a 6.2Mb microdeletion at 14q22.3 q23.2 encompassing both genes. Conclusions: Our custom NGS gene panel represents an accurate tool for genetic analysis of eye developmental diseases, allowing for a better under standing of pathogenic mechanisms, deciphering of novel phenotypic asso ciations and improving molecular diagnosis of these rare conditions.

Characteristic features are short statu re, facial dysmorphism, heart defects and cryptorchidism. Orthopedic, renal malformations, development delay and intellectual disability are also obser ved. Eyes complications are less described but very common since 95% of patients with NS displayed at list one or more ophthalmologic findings. Most of those findings are external features belonging to the characteristic facial dysmorphism of NS (hypertelorism, ptosis, down slanting palpebral fissu res and epicanthic folds). Strabismus and refractive errors (myopia, hyper metropia and astigmatism) are also frequent. Fundus changes are reported less frequently. Few cases of iris and/or optic disc coloboma in patients with NS or related disorders have been described since 1987. Only one study fo cused on eye abnormalities in NS had found coloboma in 4% (2 cases among 51 patients). None of the previously NS cases with coloboma was confirmed by molecular analysis. We describe 7 new cases of NS (or related disorders) with iris and/or optic disc coloboma and review the 10 previously reporter cases.

25202,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic basis of acute pain. Materials and methods: We measured experimentally induced mechanical pain threshold (least stimulus intensity) and pain tolerance (maximum tolerance stimulus intensity) in 1,114 previously genotyped subjects from the 10,001 Dalmatians cohort. The subjects were genotyped with either Hu manHap 300v1 or 370CNV Quad. QC protocol included removal of indivi duals with less than 97% genotyping rate, call rate below 98%, minor allele frequency below 2% and P value for FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium below 10E 10. Since subjects originated from three different groups, we performed a fixed effects meta analysis. Results: The results suggested one marginal hit for pain tolerance on chro mosome 2, belonging to ROCK2 gene (rs4260216, P,5.3x10 7). The effect size of this SNP was comparable among all subsets, with similar allele fre quencies and with very low heterogeneity (I2,0, P,0.540). This SNP also showed nominal significance association with pain threshold (P,6.8x10 4). There were no other SNPs in this region with suggestive significance, due to very low regional LD patterns. Conclusion: This gene was previously implied in cytokinesis, smooth muscle contraction and focal adhesion, thus suggesting a plausible biological role in nociception, which was also recently implied in mice study. Replication efforts on humans should focus on independent population, larger sample sizes and possibly even patients with chronic pain.

25203,"Perrault syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and female gonadal dys genesis. The prevalence of this syndrome is probably underestimated due to the discovery of secondary ovarian failure and no sign associated with deafness in boys. Recently five different genes: c10ORF2, CLPP , HARS2, HSD17B4, and LARS2 were involved in Perrault syndrome. A sixth candidate gene has been sug gested: LONP1.Thanks to NGS technique, we analyzed the five known genes and the addi tional candidate gene in a cohort of 17 patients (14 families) with a clinical picture suggestive of Perrault syndrome, 6 patients presented with neuro logical signs.

25204,"Purpose: Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an autosomal recessive dis order, affects children between birth and 3 years old and cases improper development of the eyeÃ¢ÂÂs aqueous outflow system that results in optic nerve damage and significant vision loss. PCG is predominantly caused by muta tions in the CYP1B1 gene. Aim was to understand more about the genetic factors verse the phonotypic presentation that affect the development and PCG in Saudi patients for proper diagnosis and patients care. Methods In this study we screened CYP1B1 in 75 PCG families at KKESH. DNA was extracted from affected individuals and available relatives. We performed PCR and sequence analysis to detect mutations and perform genotype/phe notype correlation. Results: This study describes a missense mutation to be responsible for di sease in less than 1% of the cases, the previously reported p. G61E mutation was found to be responsible for approximately 40% of all cases, emphasi sing on the founder effect expected from a consanguineous population like the Saudi population. Screening our cohort against the previously reported p. R469W mutation showed that it is responsible for approximately 1% of the cases. Approximately 34% were negative for CYP1B1 mutations, disease in these cases would be either due to regulatory or deep intronic mutations in CYP1B1 gene or other glaucoma known genes.

25205,"Purpose: Mutations in ABCA4 gene cause a wide range of recessive retinal disorders that can lead not only to macular dystrophies, but also more dif fuse and peripheral atrophy patterns. To date, over 800 pathogenic variants have been associated to this gene, showing an extremely high allelic hetero geneity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether certain ABCA4 alleles correlate with specific clinical features. Methods: Clinical assessment was performed to characterize and classify a cohort of 55 families into five different phenotypes: Stargardt Disease (STGD), fundus flavimaculatus (FF), bullÃ¢ÂÂs eye maculopathy, cone dystrophy and cone rod dystrophy (CRD). These families were genetically analyzed by a combination of highthroughput analyses, Sanger sequencing, genotyping microarrays, MLPA techniques, and cosegregation studies. When a new va riant was detected, the pathogenic effect was validated using bioinformatic predictions, human polymorphism databases and molecular assays. Results: In 62% of the families the two disease causing alleles were found. Overall, 61 different ABCA4 variants were identified, including 18 novel ones. Our results showed a strong correlation between particular ABCA4 associated dystrophies and certain genotypes. Thus, the presence of two missense variants were mainly related with diffuse retinal disturbances such as FF and CRD, whereas STGD patients carried one missense mutation together with a null or splicing variant. Conclusions: The clinical outcome of ABCA4 associated dystrophies may be determined by the type of the causative mutations. Our findings support that two missense variants are responsible for much more severe and diffu se phenotypes, suggesting that protein mislocalization or misfolding would cause more deleterious effects.",2016

RDs can be subdivi ded into different groups based on the primary degeneration of rod or cone photoreceptor cells. This study was conducted to investigate the underlying RD genes and mutation in consanguineous families from Pakistan. Material and Methods: Families were recruited after informed consent. Pe ripheral blood was collected and genomic DNA was extracted according to standard procedures. Homozygosity mapping was performed using Affyme trix Gene Chip Human Mapping 250 K NspI arrays. The data were analyzed using Homozygosity Mapper software. Primers for amplifying all exons and intron boundaries of all genes were designed with Primer3plus software followed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Minigene splicing assay and DNA walking were performed on respective samples. Results: Homozygosity mapping identified a novel locus in family A, one no vel gene (C8ORF37) in family B and a large novel genomic deletion of the (LCA5) gene in family C. Conclusion: Our study indicates the heterogeneous nature of retinal dystro phies in Pakistan. The amalgamation of traditional and modern molecular techniques is required for accurate identification of mutations. It is anticipa ted that these findings will contribute to future genetic testing in Pakistani families to minimize the risk of recessive disorders.",2016
25207," Introduction: Mutations in over 200 genes are associated to inherited mo nogenic retinal degenerative diseases (prevalence 1:3000 worldwide), but we are still far from completely understanding their ethiopathology. There fore, animal models are an essential tool to complement in vitro and cell cul ture assays. We aimed to generate two different mouse models by genome editing of CERKL and NR2E3, two retinal dystrophy genes, to dissect and characterize their precise role in photoreceptor cells. Methods: We have generated mouse models by the new approach RNA guided endonuclease CRISPR/Cas9 system. For CERKL, we performed a full gene deletion of nearly 100 kb. For NR2E3, we aimed to delete some of the functional domains. After zygote injections and embryo transfer, mosaic pups were genotyped to characterize the modified alleles, and were used as founder animals to obtain heterozygous homozygous mice in subsequent matings. Results: As no viability problems were observed, experiments to assess the effect of CERKL and NR2E3 deletions in retinal phenotype are currently being carried out on wildtype, heterozygous and homozygous littermates. Retinal morphology and functionality is being assessed and compared to other knock out and knock down animal models.

Methods: We aimed to characterize the gene expression pattern of sever al DUBs in the mouse retina. To this end, we detected mRNA and protein localization by in situ hybridization and fluorescent immunodetection. As a proof of principle, we also performed knockdown of selected DUB genes by morpholino microinjection in zebrafish embryos to study the resulting phenotype. Results: Several expression patterns emerge, from ubiquitous expression to DUBs mostly detected in the photoreceptor layer or axonal processes, poin ting to specific functions for different DUBs in the retina. Zebrafish knock down morphants of selected DUBs show moderate to severe eye morpholo gical defects, with defective formation of retinal structures: no lamination, no observable plexiform layers nor differentiated photoreceptors.

25209,"Introduction. Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and early onset and severe retinal dystrophies (EOSRD) are a leading cause of incurable blindness in children. The visual outcome is variable, ranging from light perception to low but measurable visual acuity in the first two decades. LCA/EOSRD can be the presenting symptom in a range of devastating ciliopathies with skel etal, neurologic and/or renal involvement. Both the visual and extraocular outcomes strongly correlate with the gene. Here, we assessed targeted NGS (T NGS) as a tool to improve the care of infants with severe visual deficiency. Methods. 300 index LCA/EOSRD cases were sequenced using a T NGS array comprising 45 genes causing monosymptomatic and/or syndromic EOSRD and 10 genes of differential diagnoses. Mutations and familial segregation analysis were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results. T NGS allowed identifying disease causing mutations in 184/300 (60 %) of the index cases: 10/184 had mutations that could not be detected by Sanger sequencing, including 9 heterozygote rearrangements (8 deleti ons, 1 duplication) and one mosaic (54 /395 reads), 6/184 had homozygous large deletions. Conclusion. The molecular diagnosis in LCA/EOSRD neonates is crucial to predict the visual outcome, and to decide whether vital functions should be monitored. Yet, the genetic heterogeneity of these blinding conditions long challenged routine molecular testing. The identification of the mutation un derlying the disease in 60% of the cases and the detection of second disease alleles missed by PCR based Sanger sequencing in 5 % out of them support the relevance of implementing routine T NGS for LCA/EOSRD.",2016
25210,"Introduction: CERKL mutations cause retinitis pigmentosa and cone rod dystrophy in human. The CERKL gene is a paradigm for high transcriptional complexity, with many isoforms produced by alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters. The protein displays several protein domains, such as lipid kinase, nuclear localization and nuclear export signals. Although the precise physiological function is still unknown, CERKL overexpression pro tects cells from apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress. Results: In vitro studies on cultured cells showed that CERKL binds mRNA and contributes to stress granule complexes. These in vitro results have been further confirmed in isolated retinal neurons (retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors), where CERKL co localizes with RNA and RNA binding proteins and is a component of the stress granules produced under oxida tive stress conditions. Moreover, differential localization of CERKL isoforms in rods and cones has been shown using a panel of in house antibodies. Conclusions: This differential isoform specifity is highly suggestive of spe cific functional roles for CERKL in different photoreceptor cell types. Future work will address the impact of CERKL mutations in rods and cones related to human visual pathophysiology.

25211,"Massive exome sequencing (WES) has revolutionized genetic diagnosis of highly heterogeneous monogenic disorders, as is the case of Retinitis pig mentosa (RP), the most frequent retinal disorder. A heterozygous stop mutation was identified by WES in the EYS gene in an isolated RP patient . A subsequent dosage study of the EYS exons in the fami ly was suggestive of a large deletion encompassing at least 10 exons, which was later supported by SNP cosegregation analysis. The identification of the second mutation confirmed EYS as the causative gene with autosomal recessive inheritance in the family. The second case was a large autosomal dominant RP pedigree with no plausible mutations revealed by WES in 5 affected members. Cosegregation of a rare FGF21 variant with the disease in this family highlighted a closely linked RP gene (CRX) as a promising can didate. Coverage and SNP studies of the CRX genomic region in the patients, followed by genomic mapping with specific PCR primers, identified the boundaries of a heterozygous 10 kb deletion, spanning exons 3 and 4 of CRX. The benefits of WES for the molecular diagnosis of highly heterogeneous mendelian disorders are well established. However, the main drawback is the identification of gross structural genomic alterations at heterozygosity by using standard variant calling strategies.

We studied 24 affected males from 16 families with either a structurally intact gene cluster or at least one intact single (hybrid) gene, but carrying rare combinations of common SNPs in exon 3 in single or multiple OPN1LW and OPN1MW gene copies. We applied a semi quantitative minigene splicing as say to assess twelve different OPN1LW/MW exon 3 haplotypes. Nine haplo types resulted in aberrant splicing of equal or more than 20% of transcripts including the known pathogenic haplotypes (i.e. Ã¢ÂÂLIAVAÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂLVAVAÃ¢ÂÂ) with ab sent or minute amounts of correctly spliced transcripts, respectively. In one family with strikingly different phenotypes we observed de novo occurrence of the Ã¢ÂÂLIAVAÃ¢ÂÂ haplotype derived from an ancestral less deleterious Ã¢ÂÂLIAVSÃ¢ÂÂ haplotype. We could establish an intrachromosomal gene conversion in the male germline as the underlying mechanism driving the phenotype change from macula dystrophy with deuteranopia into Blue Cone Monochromacy. The converted sequence was narrowed to a region of ~1300 bp originating from a downstream OPN1MW gene. Although gene conversion shaping the OPN1LW/OPN1MW genes has been postulated and inferred from new ari sing mutations, we are the first to demonstrate a de novo gene conversion within the lineage of a pedigree.

Deep intronic variants have also been shown to affect RNA splicing. About 30% of STGD1 patients carry one or no ABCA4 variant, and we hypothesize that the missing muta tions reside in the non coding parts. Transcript analysis is not straightfor ward as ABCA4 is specifically expressed in the retina. The purpose of this study is to (1) identify intronic variants in unsolved patients by ABCA4 locus sequencing, and (2) to prove their functional effects as well the effect of non canonical splice variants, by in vitro splice assays. Methods: Haloplex based locus sequencing was performed in 70 mono al lelic maculopathy cases. After applying splice site prediction programs, the effect of intronic variants was tested in vitro by cloning ~1.5 kb fragments into minigenes, transfecting them into HEK393T cells and performing re verse transcription PCR. Results: Haloplex sequencing revealed > 80 rare deep intronic vari ants which potentially activate cryptic exons. At least 12 are being ana lyzed by minigene splice assays. The non canonical c.5461 10T>C and c.6729+5_6729+19del variants were shown to result in exon 39/40 or 48 skipping, respectively, effectively resulting in null alleles. Conclusions: Two non canonical splice variants, among which the most fre quent severe ABCA4 variant, c.5461 10T>C, were shown to completely in activate ABCA4 function.

STL is characterized by midfacial underdevelopment and cleft palate (either alone or as part of the Robin sequence); eye abnormalities; hearing loss (both conductive and/or sensorineural); and mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and/or precocious arthritis. Eye findings include high myopia, cataract, retinal detachment leading to impaired vision or blindness. The degree of hearing loss varies among affected individuals and may become more severe over time. There are several types of STL, which are distinguished by their genetic cause and their characteristic signs and symptoms. The most common type I (STL1) is responsible for approximately 70% of reported cases and presents with a wide variety of symptoms affecting the eye, ear, facial appearance, palate and musculoskeletal system and occurs due to mutations over the entire COL2A1 gene on chromosome location 12q13.11.

A recent study (Gonzalez del Pozo et al) has questioned the pathogenicity of this variant detected homozygously in two asymptomatic individuals. However, the high prevalence of the p.

Cys759Phe mutation as a cause of syndromic or non syndromic RP .A total of 81 Spanish families affected with RP or USH, carrying the p. Cys759Phe mutation, either in homozygosis or heterozygosis, were ana lyzed using classical molecular techniques. Among them, 15 heterozygous cases were further studied by different targeted NGS approaches in order to identify the second causative allele. We could characterize 68 families being 12 of them homozygous for the p. Cys759Phe variant. Furthermore, fifty three compound heterozygous for USH2A were also found. In three out of 68 characterized patients, cau sative mutations in a different gene were identified being also carriers of the p. Cys759Phe. The remaining 13 uncharacterized families with the p. Cys759Phe in heterozygosis are being analysed by NGS for detecting di sease causing mutation. All these data together seem to point to the pathogenic causative role for p.

25218,"Introduction: 21 hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive endocri ne disorder due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. Severe enzyme defici ency can present as a classical salt wasting (SW) and simple virilizing form (SV). The In2G (c.293 13A/C>G) mutation provides ~ 2% enzyme activity. It encompasses 25% of the classic 21 hydroxylase deficiency alleles and 51% of the SW alleles. Materials and Methods: We have performed molecular analysis of the In2G (c.293 13A/C>G) mutation in 49 Macedonian patients with clinical and la boratory signs of severe form of 21 hydroxylase deficiency, 26 SW and 23 SV form, evaluated at the Department of Endocrinology and Genetics, Uni versity ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Clinic, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, using differential PCR/ACRS. Of the patients, 27 had Macedonian, 14 Albanian, and 8 Roma ethnic origin. Results: The In2G mutation was detected in 57.1% of the patients, 40.8% were homozygotes and 16.3% were heterozygotes. It was revealed in 65.4% (34/52) of the SW alleles, and 30.4% (14/46) of the SV alleles. Interestingly, In2G was detected in all Roma patients on 93.8% of the alleles (7 homozy gotes and 1 heterozygote), followed by 57.1% of the Albanians on 53.6% alleles (7 homozygotes and 1 heterozygote), and 44.4% of the Macedonian patients on 33.3% of the alleles (6 homozygotes and 6 heterozygote).Conclusions: We found different ethnic distribution of the In2G mutation in the Macedonian patients with severe 21 hydroxylase deficiency. High In2G frequency detected in our patients, that is comparable to the most of the other European countries, supports its role in classical phenotype of the 21 hydroxylase deficiency.",2016
25219,"Background: While many causes of 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD) have been elucidated, the mechanisms leading to 46,XX (ovo)testicu lar DSD are poorly understood. Both conditions may represent a phenotypic spectrum resulting from a common underlying genetic defect. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was applied to identify the molecular cause in ten unrelated patients with 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD. Transcrip tional activation of the variant of interest was assessed using luciferase assays. RNA seq was performed on patient derived lymphocytes. Immu nohistochemistry was done on gonadal specimens for markers of gonadal development. Results: We identified a novel heterozygous NR5A1 variant c.274C>T p.(Arg92Trp) in three unrelated cases with 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD. This variant is absent in genomic databases and is predicted to be deleterious. The Arg92 residue is conserved up to zebrafish and located in the RGGR motif before the C terminus helix in the conserved Ftz F1 box, likely affec ting DNA binding stability and specificity. Immunohistochemistry confir med SRY independent SOX9 expression and absence of FOXL2 in testicular parts of XX gonads and vice versa in ovarian regions. No consistent changes in transcriptional activation were seen. RNA seq showed upregulation of MAMLD1, a direct target of NR5A1. Conclusions: Previously, loss of function mutations in NR5A1 were found in a spectrum of male undervirilization. Here, a novel NR5A1 mutation was found in three out of ten cases with 46,XX (ovo)testicular DSD, an ultra rare condition. We hypothesize that this variant results in gain of function and triggers testicular differentiation in 46,XX individuals. We propose NR5A1 mutation p.(Arg92Trp) as a novel and recurrent cause of 46,XX (ovo)testi cular DSD.",2016
25220,"AddisonÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the failure of the adrenal cortex. Besides HLA and a few shared autoimmunity predisposing associated loci, the genetics underlying AD is largely unknown. The Swedish Addison registry consists of 700 AD patients accurately charac terized regarding their clinical phenotype and autoimmune serological pa rameters. 83% of the patients have 21 hydroxylase autoantibodies and 62% have at least another autoimmune disease. We resequenced 1,900 target genes involved in immune function and autoimmunity in all AD patients and in 1,500 healthy controls. Targets included coding sequences, full UTRs and conserved intronic and intergenic regions. GATK, LASER and KING software were used to call variants, pinpoint predicted non Europeans and identify related samples, respectively. Single SNP and aggregate association tests, as well as pathway analysis will be performed in order to confirm known and unravel novel loci associated with AD and its co inherited autoimmune di seases in the Swedish population. We expect that our study of a slightly unconstrained Swedish population isolate will enable to improve global diagnostic and medical AD treatments by finding disease variants likely to be causative across different populati ons.

25221,"Background: In around 30% of families with colorectal adenomatous po lyposis, no germline mutation in the known genes APC, MUTYH, POLE, POLD1, or NTHL1 can be identified, although a hereditary etiology is likely. Methods: To uncover new high penetrance causative genes, exome sequen cing of leukocyte DNA from 104 unrelated patients with unexplained ade nomatous polyposis was performed. For data analysis and variant filtering, an established bioinformatics pipeline including in house tools was applied. Results: We identified two unrelated patients with differing compound heterozygous loss of function germline mutations in a DNA repair gene. The pedigrees, genotypes, and the frequency of mutations of this gene in the general population are consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. By transcriptional analysis, by functional analysis of the tumor tissue and by use of various in silico tools we found strong evidence for a loss of function effect. No germline mutation in any other gene known to cause polyposis was identified in these patients. Both index patients had an affected sibling carrying the same mutations. Besides colorectal and duode nal adenomas, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and early onset astrocytoma were reported in the two patients and their affected siblings. In addition, we identified one unrelated patient with a biallelic PMS2 germline mutation, representing Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency Syndrome (CMMR D). Conclusions: The present study is the first to identify biallelic pathogenic germline mutations of the given DNA repair gene in patients with a suspec ted hereditary tumor syndrome. Our data suggest that the reported cases represent a novel recessive subtype of colorectal adenomatous polyposis.",2016
25222," Disorders of sex development (DSD) are group of heterogeneous conditions that usually present with atypical genitalia and/or delayed puberty. One of the most common disorders in this group is the Androgen Insensitivity Syn drome (AIS) the affected individuals are phenotypically females with resi stance to androgen action and 46,XY karyotype. More than 600 mutations associated with the variable phenotype of the disorder are known in Andro gen Receptor (AR) gene (Xq12). Fourteen XY female patients were referred to our team due to primary amenorrhea and/or discordance between phe notypic and chromosomal sex. Molecular analysis of AR gene was conducted using Sanger sequencing (9 patients) and targeted Next generation sequen cing (5 patients). Mutations in 6 patients were found: p. Q147Ter, p. R616H, p. R780W and p. I842N. The mutation was inherited from the heterozygous mother in 4 of the cases. The mother of the one patient was not a carrier and the mutation was de novo. DNA sample from relatives of the last patient were not available. Further analyses revealed mutations in SRY, SRD5A2 and NR5A1 genes in three of the remaining eight cases. Conclusion: Sanger sequencing of AR is indicated for patients with strong suspicions for AIS while use of targeted next generation sequencing of known genes associated with DSD could be beneficial in cases with atypical phenotype and clinical data. The combination of routine and new genetic technologies could be crucial for the molecular diagnosis in such genetically heterogenous diseases as 46,XY DSD.",2016
25223,"Introduction: Alport syndrome (AS) is a progressive inherited renal disease caused by mutations in three large collagen IV genes (COL4A3, COL4A4, CO L4A5), comprising about 50 exons each. Recently, the introduction of next generation sequencing allowed the analysis of all three AS genes in a single step. Despite that, the total mutation detection rate has been estimated bet ween 55 80%. Materials and Methods: We selected three Italian families with clear clinical evidence of AS but no molecular diagnosis, despite having been subjected to extensive candidate gene analyses. The probands were screened by whole exome sequencing (WES) using the Nextera Rapid Capture kit on a Next Seq500 platform. All exons of AS genes were adequately covered. Results: Analysis of variants within AS genes identified pathogenic muta tions in all families. In Family 1, we identified an homozygous 24 bp in frame deletion in COL4A3 (p. Val11_Leu18del), segregating with autosomal recessive AS. The variant is predicted to disrupt the signal peptide, possibly altering COL4A3 protein secretion. In Family 2 proband, a COL4A5 hemi zygous missense mutation (p. Gly491Asp) was found in exon 33, which was not covered by previous targeted resequencing. In Family 3, we detected an heterozygous intronic variant (c.2245 40A>G) altering COL4A5 exon 29 branch site, as we confirmed by in vitro studies. Analysis of the pattern of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) on DNA from blood revealed a correlation between unbalanced XCI and phenotypic manifestations in mutant females. Conclusions: WES was fundamental to provide a molecular diagnosis in 3 AS families, highlighting non obvious pathogenic variants that escaped pre vious screenings.

25224,"Introduction: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe form of chronic kidney disease, frequently diagnosed prenatally. AR PKD is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene, nevertheless, the same phe notype is part of many other disorders. Thus, the molecular genetic analysis can be very useful in differential diagnosis of ARPKD. Herein, we present the results of molecular genetic analysis in 52 families with clinically suspected ARPKD. Materials and methods: The analysis of PKHD1 was carried out using next generation sequencing and subsequent MLPA (multiplex ligation de pendent probe amplification). In some of the families, genetic analysis of HNF1ÃÂ², PKD1/2 was carries out. The cohort of probands was divided into 2 groups (Group A and B) on the basis of their fulfillment of clinical criteria of ARPKD. Patients fulfilling all criteria were placed in Group A (n,24). Group B consisted of 30 patients. Results: The detection rate in PKHD1 amounted to 81% in Group A, and 27% in Group B. Six families within Group B without mutation in PKHD1 harbored mutations in other genes (HNF1ÃÂ², PKD1/2 and NPHP11 ).Conclusions: The detection rate of PKHD1 mutations in children fulfilling all clinically diagnostic criteria of ARPKD is high, reaching 81%. However, mu tations of PKHD1 were also detected in some of the patients without having met all three clinical criteria, especially in patients who died perinatally. The important sign of ARPKD in children proved to be congenital hepatic fibro sis.

25225,"Introduction:Untreated familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) increases the risk for develo ping atherosclerosis and cardio vascular disease in early adulthood for up to 100 fold. Slovenia launched the program of universal screening for hyper cholesterolemia in 5 year old children in 1995 with routine measurement of fasting serum cholesterol. Additionally, the routine genetic screening using NGS technology was introduced in 2011 to identify causative genetic variants in individuals with positive result of the screening. Materials and Methods: 272 individuals (149 females) were sent to a tertiary paediatric outpatient clinic due to the increased level of serum cholesterol and referred to genetic testing. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples according to established laboratory protocol. Samples for NGS were prepared using ADH MASTR assay (Multiplicom, Belgium) for detection of variants in 4 genes as sociated with FH (LDLR, PCSK9, APOE and exon 26 of APOB) and sequenced on a MiSeq platform with MiSeq reagent kit v2 (Illumina, California) follo wing the manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs protocol. Results: 105 (38.6%) of individuals had causative variant identified in LDLR gene followed by 55 individuals (18.4%) with causative variant in APOB and none in PCSK9. Additionally, 51 participants (18.7%) were carriers of APOE E4 isoform genotype. The results of genetic analysis were negative for 66 par ticipants (24.3%).Conclusions:Results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of universal screening programme with most participants having genetically confirmed FH. Additionally, data for family history may not suffice for reliable identification of FH patients.

25226,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbi dity and mortality worldwide. However, the biological mechanisms under lying the development and progression of COPD are not yet well understood. We analysed sequence based transcriptomics data in COPD cases and con trols from the EvA study, as part of the AirPROM project. Cell material was obtained by airway epithelial brushing (305 cases/232 controls) and bron choalveolar lavage (182 cases/174 controls).Case control differential expression was tested using an exact permutati on test, and lasso regression was used to assess whether differentially ex pressed genes were able to predict case control status. The dataset was divided into training and testing sets of randomly selected individuals, and average predictive values across 50 iterations of ~80% for brushing and ~70% for lavage were obtained. A small number of genes were selected in more than 40 out of the 50 iterations suggesting their potential relevance in biological processes relevant to COPD. Additionally, genes were clustered into modules according to their co expression across individuals, and the association of these modules with COPD status and other related traits were tested using weighted gene co expression network analysis. This approach highlighted some of the genes selected by the lasso regression analysis. Genome wide data has now been generated for this set of individuals and integrative analysis is in progress. Overall, these analyses will highlight genes relevant to biological processes present in COPD patients and have the potential to improve our understan ding of this complex disease.

25227,"Introduction: Molecular diagnosis of combined pituitary hormone defici ency (CPHD) and septo optic dysplasia (SOD) by classical gene screening cascade has a poor success rate due to the increasing number of implicated genes, the genetic overlap with other clinical entities such as congenital hy pogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and the recently postulated oligoge nic inheritance. Aim: To design, implement and validate a targeted NGS panel to identify the genetic determinants of CPHD and SOD. Subjects and Methods A cohort of 82 CPHD or SOD patients were analysed with the HYPOPIT .V1 panel, including a total of 73 genes: 50 found to be mutated in pituitary dis orders and 23 genes in associated signalling pathways. Variants were valida ted by Sanger sequencing, MLPA or aCGH. Results: After having completed the analysis of 26 patients (CPHD n,19; SOD, n,7), we have identified likely pathogenic variants in 11 (42%); 7 of which presented potentially relevant variants in more than one gene, some of them in genes known to be implicated in CHH, such as FGFR1, FGF8, and PROKR2, and in holoprosencephaly associated genes (CDON, GLI2, ZIC2, PTCH1, EYA4 ). Interestingly, in 3/11 patients, we also detected variants in CHD7, a gene implicated in CHARGE syndrome. Conclusions: Targeted NGS identified disease relevant variants in 42% of analyzed CPHD and SOD cases, supporting the hypothesis of digenic/oligo genic inheritance in 27% of the examined patients. These results confirm the utility of the targeted NGS approach for improving the molecular dia gnosis of CPHD and SOD. Supported by grant FIS 12/00649 from ISCIII & FEDER.",2016
25228,"Introduction: A congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is a congenital hamartomatous pulmonary lesion that results from abnormal overgrowth of tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar, or alveolar tissue. The clini cal presentation is variable, ranging from the most serious phenotype which may result in hydrops fetalis to mild phenotype with possible resolution. Affected new borns present with severe respiratory distress or remain asymptomatic until later in life. Surgical resection is the definitive treat ment. The disorder is rare (1/8300 1/35,000 live births) and occurs mainly sporadically. The condition is due to a defective branching morphogenesis of the lung at different developmental stages. What triggers this developmen tal defect is unknown, yet alteration of the signalling pathways controlling lung development are thought to be the cause. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was conducted on 15 CCAM trios follo wing the standard protocol. Results: Damaging de novo mutations in four genes known to be involved in airway epithelium response to cigarette smoking and lung cancer (SPG11, MICAL2 and LRRC16A) or soft tissue sarcoma (SCYL1) found in 4/15 pa tients. Importantly, damaging mutations forming compound heterozygotes were detected in SLC15A1, a gene involved in lung peptide clearance in bronchial airway epithelial cell lines. Likewise, mutations in interacting ge nes co existed in several patients and its relevance is being assessed. Copy number analysis is underway. Conclusion: CCAM is genetically heterogeneous with different mutated ge nes in different patients and it is likely to require mutations in more than one gene to give rise to the developmental anomaly.

Introduction: In congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) insulin secretion is dys regulated leading to severe hypoglycaemia in neonates and infants. Focal forms of CHI have been reported in 20 50% of mutation positive patients. The focal form is caused by a paternally transmitted recessive mutation in ABCC8 or KCNJ11 on chromosome 11p15 and a second somatic event in the affected islet of Langerhans. In pancreatic lesions we investigated the gene tic mechanisms underlying focal form of CHI. Methods: Patients with proven ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutations and receiving therapeutic surgery were included. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and gene expression were analysed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Deletions, du plications and uniparental isodisomy (UPD) were tested by methylation specific MLPA. The effect of UPD on gene expression levels was analysed by massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE) and real time quantitative PCR. Results: LOH was found in 10/11 focal lesions, in contrast to surrounding pancreatic tissue or blood cells. Monoallellic expression of mutant ABCC8/ KCNJ11 alleles occurred in all lesions, whereas unaffected pancreatic tissue showed biallelic expression. Both, ABCC8 and KCNJ11, are located in pro ximity to the Beckwith Wiedemann imprinting control region on chromoso me 11p15 that is prone to UPD. Paternal UPD 11p15 was specifically found in samples showing LOH, neither deletion nor duplication was detected. Pa ternal UPD in focal lesions resulted in expression changes of 11p15 imprin ted genes and upregulation of endocrine transcription factors. Conclusions: Focal form of CHI is caused by somatic paternal UPD 11p15 leading to monoallelic expression of mutant ABCC8/KCNJ11 and affects gene expression of lesional endocrine cells.",2016
25230,"Introduction: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the most frequent inborn me tabolism error, is caused in 90 95% of the cases, by mutations in the 21 hy droxylase gene (CYP21A2 ). The deficiency can present as severe, or classical form (C), and non classical one (NC). CYP21A2 and C4 genes constitute the RCCX module. About 70% of haplotypes have a bimodular arrangement, with one module carrying CYP21A2 and the other the highly homologous pseudogene CYP21A1P . A regulatory region of the CYP21A2, named Z pro moter (ZP), is located 5.6 kb upstream. Materials and Methods: 628 pati ents (137 C, 491 NC) diagnosed as 21 hydroxylase deficient were studied. In 380/628 we studied the most frequent mutations. In 248/628 the enti re CYP21A2 gene was sequenced. Gene dosage was analyzed by MLPA. In 80/628 the ZP was sequenced. The RCCX region was studied by Southern blot, MLPA and long range PCR. In vitro and/or in silico analyses, developed in our laboratory, were performed to determine the biological implications of novel mutations. Results: 100% of C and 86% of NC patients were fully genotyped. We have identified 10 novel mutations in the coding region and one in the ZP . All novel variants showed pathogenicity. We identified 3 novel haplotypes among 16 different conformations of the RCCX module. Conclu sions: The CYP21A2 gene is located in one of the most complex regions of the genome. Our results represent one of the larger series of patients in Latin America.

25231,"Introduction: A biomarker that can be used for the evaluation of disease progression and the treatment efficacy in cystic fibrosis (CF) would be of a great importance. Increased expression of the human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) was previously described in CF lung biopsies, but it is unknown whe ther serum HE4 concentrations are elevated in CF. Materials ans Methods: 77 young and 57 adult CF patients were enrolled together with 117 normal controls. Serum HE4 was measured by an immu noassay and its expression was investigated using RT qPCR in CF versus non CF respiratory epithelium biopsies. The expression of the potential re gulator miR 140 5p was analyzed using an UPL based RT qPCR assay. HE4 was measured in the supernatants from unpolarized and polarized CF bron chial epithelial CFBE cells expressing wt or F508del CFTR. Results: Serum HE4 levels were significantly elevated in affected children and in adult CF patients (median 99.5 and 115.7 pmol/L, respectively) compared to controls (36.3 pmol/L). In CF patients, HE4 levels positively correlated with disease severity and CRP concentrations, while an inverse relationship was found between HE4 and the spirometric FEV1 value. HE4 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated with a decreased miR 140 5p expression in the CF airway biopsies. There were 2 fold higher HE4 concen trations in the supernatant of polarized F508del CFTR CFBE cells compared to wt cells. Conclusions: HE4 serum levels correlate with the overall severity of CF and the degree of pulmonary dysfunction. HE4 may thus be utilized as novel in flammatory biomarker and possibly also as measure of treatment efficacy in CF lung disease.",2016

These diseases are common in the Saudi population and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Over 50 ciliopathy genes, which encode proteins that influence the structure and function of the primary cilia, are implicated in cystic kidney disease. Materials and Methods: In order to define the phenotype and genotype of cystic kidney disease in fetuses and neonates, we correlated antenatal ul trasound examination and postnatal renal ultrasound examination with targeted exon sequencing, using a renal gene panel. A cohort of 50 fami lies in whom antenatal renal USS findings in affected cases included either bilateral cystic kidney disease, echogenic kidneys or enlarged kidneys was investigated. Results: In this cohort, causative mutations and inferred causative muta tions using parental DNA were detected in 35 families (70%). Extra renal malformations, including encephalocele, polydactyly and heart malforma tions, consistent with ciliopathy phenotypes, were frequently detected. Mu tations were found in 14 different genes with a total of 15 novel pathogenic variants. Mutations in CC2D2A followed by PKHD1 were the most common cause of an antenatally suspected ciliopathy in our cohort. Conclusion: In families with ciliopathy phenotypes, mutational analysis using a targeted gene panel allows a rapid molecular diagnosis and provides important information for patients, parents and their physicians.",2016

This study aimed to determine whether fetal hypothyroidism (FH) affects GLUT1 and GLUT4 gene expressions in insulin sensitive tissue of young (3 months) and aged (19 months) offspring rats. Materials and Methods: Pregnant Wistar rats were divided into two groups: The FH group received water containing 0.025% 6 propyl 2 thiouracil du ring gestation and the controls consumed tap water. Offspring from both groups (n,6 in each group) were followed until month 3 and month 19. GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA expression in isolated heart, adipose tissue, and soleus muscle were measured using real time polymerase chain reaction in 3 and 19 months offspring. Results: Compared with controls, in FH rats, GLUT1 expression was lower in all tissues in both the young (34%, 41% and 84% for heart, adipose and so leus, respectively) and aged rats (51%, 64% and 78% for heart, adipose and soleus, respectively). In addition, FH rats had lower expression of GLUT4 in adipose tissue (84% for young and 88% for aged rats) and higher expressi on in heart (104% for young and 388% for aged rats) and soleus (290% for young and 591% for aged rats) tissues. Conclusion: Hypothyroidism during fetal life affects mRNA expression of glucose transporters during later life in both young and aged rats; these changes may contribute to impaired carbohydrate metabolism.",2016

The aim of this study was to identify novel mutations in the most prevalent MODY genes (HNF4ÃÂ±, GCK and HNF1ÃÂ±) in patients from Castilla y Leon. Patients and Methods: We have studied 232 patients with clinical diagnosis of MODY from Hospitals from Castilla y Leon. The HNF4ÃÂ±, GCK and HNF1ÃÂ± genes were analyzed by direct sequencing. In silico predictions of the patho genicity were carried out using: PolyPhen, pMut and SIFT .Results: We have identified a total of 46 patients with mutations in HNF4ÃÂ±, GCK or HNF1ÃÂ± genes (20%) and 15 from these were novel mutations (32,60%). A missense mutation and a nonsense mutation had not been pre viously reported in the HNF4ÃÂ± gene (p. T117I, p. R131X), both in exon 4. The following novel variations were identified in GCK gene: IVS7+1G>A, p. M57I, p. T116P , p. K205N, p. Trp257_Leu266delinsPLLLLfsX27, p. F316fsX352, p. C371X, p. V374M, p. G385A, p. Y413X. Three more unreported mutations were identified in HNF1ÃÂ± gene (p. T137fsX17, c.865 INSC, p. T458I). In silico analysis predicted all of the novel mutations to be pathogenic. Conclusions: Recurrent mutations have not been detected in our cohort of MODY patients. It implies that there is still a high incidence of novel mu tations. It is necessary to study all the coding region and adjacent intronic regions of prevalent MODY genes for improving the diagnosis. Supported by FIS FEDER PI13/01741",2016

The causative mutations in known ge nes have not been identified in more than 50% of 46,XY DSD cases. Among the detectable causative factors, deletions or nucleotide mutations of the SRY gene account for about 10 15 %. This implies that the vast majority of patients with gonadal DSD do not have an underlying molecular etiopatho genesis as of yet. Material and methods: Ten unrelated patients diagnosed as complete 46,XY GD were selected to be included in the study. All patients with the diagnosis of XY complete GD met the clinical criteria for the inclusion. Sequence ana lysis of SRY, WT1 and CBX2 genes were performed in all patients and the genomic DNA from 10 unrelated females with complete 46,XY GD were pro cessed on the Affymetrix Cyto2.7M array consistent with the manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs protocol. Results: The analysis result suggested that the most significant region maps to chromosome 8q24.3 which was previously reported by another indepen dent study with a similar patient cohort and this region being probable can didate related to complete 46,XY GD. Conclusion: Duplication of 8q24.3 region may be responsible for DSD etio logy, because of in total three different cases with either partial or complete gonadal dysgenesis have been identified.

The aim of the study is to present the renal replacement therapy methods in our groups, genetic changes linked with the type of HUS, complications and mortality rate. Methods. A retrospective analysis was supported on 49 children patients, aged 2 months to 17 years, with the diagnosis of HUS. We analyze the cases using the classic classification and evaluate the cases using data linked to re nal replacement therapy need and mortality. Genetic testing was performed by Semmelweis University Budapest for 3 aHUS patients. Results. More than 80% of patients were dialyzed. Mortality was correlated with the severity of extra renal involvement (less than 20%). One patient was found to be homozygous for a common deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes, no other copy number alterations were identified (although in parents). The second patient was found to be heterozygous for a substitution in exon 23 of the CFH gene (c.3592G>C) causing a glutamic acid to glutamine change at codon 1198 of the complement factor H protein (p. E1198Q) and hetero zygous for a substitution in exon 7 of the CFHR5 gene (c.1067G>A). Other patient was found to be heterozygous for a mutation causing amino acid change (Q950H) in scr16 of complement factor H, and heterozygous for the rare allele of the CFH E936D polymorphism. Conclusions. Different mutations were discovered in our cases, some expec ted to have a pathogenic role in the development of aHUS.",2016
25237,"Introduction: Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a rare but clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease caused by pathogenic mutations in several genes leading to impaired production and secretion of gonadotropin hormones and consequently sex hormones. HH is characte rized by an absence or delay of puberty and infertility. The association of HH with hyposmia or anosmia is defined as Kallmann syndrome. Molecular genetic testing of HH is important, as it can prompt the treatment. Materials and Methods:11 subjects (10 males, one female) aged between 16 and 67 years with suspicion of congenital HH were included. Seven ma les had Kallmann syndrome, 3 males had normosmic HH. The female had suspicion of Kallmann syndrome. Three subjects had other congenital ano malies associated with HH (colour blindness, anomalies of heart, learning ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 89Back to index disabilities, long limbs, sensorineural deafness, bimanual synkinesis, hyper telorism). Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of 24 genes known to be associated with HH was used to identify genetic variants that were subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Six mutations in five genes (PROK2, GNRHR, PROKR2, FGFR1 and CHD7) were detected in six patients. Among them, three variants namely PROK2 NM_001126128.1: c.171_172delTT (p.

Conclusion: NGS enables fast and reliable identification of causal mutations in several genes related to HH simultaneously. Presented subject group with HH was genetically very diverse and the results expand the spectrum of mu tations implicated in HH.",2016
25238,"Introduction: Molecular diagnosis of cystic and glomerular inherited kidney diseases (IKD) is complicated by their high genetic heterogeneity and phe notypic variability. Clinical manifestations of these diseases cover a broad range of phenotypes that can be mimicked by mutations in several genes. We aimed to develop a more comprehensive approach for genetic diagnosis of these IKD. Materials and methods: Massive parallel sequencing of 124 genes causative or associated with cystic or glomerular IKD was performed in 216 patients, a validation cohort (114 patients) and a diagnostic cohort (102 patients).Results: We identified 136 of the 140 mutations in the validation cohort in cluding several CNVs, demonstrating similar sensitivity than Sanger sequen cing with the advantage of detecting CNVs in a single approach. Moreover, the kidney panel allows a more comprehensive analysis by identifying 1) mutations in low frequency mutated genes, such as NPHP3 mutations in pa tients with clinical suspicion of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disea se and CUBN mutations in nephrotic syndrome; 2) complex inheritance pat terns, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients with two pathogenic mutations in PKD1 and/or PKD2 genes or Alport syndrome patients with mutations in two different collagen IV genes; 3) coinheritance of mutations in two genes causative of different IKD. Conclusions: Massive parallel sequencing of this kidney disease gene panel is a comprehensive, efficient and cost effective tool for genetic diagnosis of cystic and glomerular IKD.",2016
25239,"Introduction: The large number of implicated genes and their oligogenic inheritance complicates the genetic diagnosis of patients with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) and Kallmann sÃÂ­ndrome (KS). Aim: We set out to identify the molecular defect in a cohort of CHH, HH and KS patients using a targeted NGS panel. Subsequently we evaluated the number of cases with monogenic or oligogenic inheritance. Methods. Cohort of 58 probands: 39 CHH, 16 KS, 2 CHARGE with HH and 1 CAH with HH. All were screened for mutations using the NGS panel, HY POPIT .V1, which includes a total of 73 genes: 50 found to be mutated in pi tuitary disorders and 23 genes in associated signalling pathways. Variants were validated by Sanger sequencing, MLPA or arrayCGH. Results: Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified in 19/58 probands (33%). The phenotype could be explained by the identified muta tions in 8 of these (42%). In the remaining 11 probands, only one mutation was identified; 9 in genes with reported oligogenicity, and two are individu als with heterozygous variants in GNRHR and GNRH1 suggesting the possi bility of oligogenic inheritance for these genes. Interestingly, a heterozygous mutation in POU1F1 was observed in an adult patient with KS. Conclusions: Targeted NGS has increased our mutation detection rate and has also demonstrated the implication of further genes in the etiology of these pathologies.",2016
25240,"Aim and Introduction: Identification of abnormal kidneys in the fetus may lead to termination of the pregnancy and raises questions about the under lying cause and recurrence risk in future pregnancies. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of targeted next generation sequencing in fetuses with prenatally detected kidney anomalies in order to uncover genetic explanations and assess recurrence risk. Also, we aim to study the relation between genetic findings and post mortem kidney hi stology. Methods: The study comprises fetuses diagnosed prenatally with bilateral kidney anomalies that have undergone postmortem examination. The approximately 110 genes included in the targeted panel were chosen on the basis of their potential involvement in embryonic kidney development, cystic kidney disease, or the renin angiotensin system. DNA was extracted from fetal tissue samples or cultured chorion villus cells, aminocytes, or fibroblasts. Data analysis was performed using CLC Geno mics workbench, publicly available databases, and prediction tools. The Regional Ethical Committee approved the study. Results: Samples from 61 fetuses from 57 families were included in the stu dy. Two fetuses had mutations in the nephronophthisis associated gene, TMEM67 and six fetuses had mutations in kidney developmental genes. For these fetuses kidney histology is presented. Conclusion and Perspectives: In eight (14%) fetuses we identified a likely genetic cause of the kidney anomalies. Ten fetuses from eight families, in which no mutations were identified, have been selected for exome sequencing in order to uncover novel genes asso ciated to fetal kidney anomalies.",2016
25241,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency (LPLD) is characterized by severe hyper triglyceridaemia. The most debilitating clinical manifestation of the disease is recurrent, severe and potentially life threatening acute pancreatitis. LPLD is caused by loss of function mutations in the gene encoding LPL, regulated the plasma levels of triglyceride. Variant of the LPL gene Ser447stop called LPL S447X is the only variant associated with increased LPL enzyme activity leading to reduced triglyceride levels. It was developed a LPL gene therapy product, Alipogene tiparvovec (Glybera, AMT 01, AAV1 LPLS447X), an adeno associated virus serotype 1 based gene therapy that results in the expression of gain of function S447X vari ant of the human LPL gene. The aim of this work was to establish a molecular genetic screening pro gram of patients with LPLD caused by loss of function mutations in LPL gene, suitable for AAV1 LPLS447X gene therapy. Method: The examined group has consisted of patients with severe or multi ple pancreatitis attacks. Genomic DNA has been extracted from whole blood. Screening algorithm in LPLD patients has been: 1. HRM based LightSNiP as say to detect the most common LPL mutation Asn291Ser (cooperation with TIBMolBiol), 2. MLPA (P218 MRC Holand) confirmed using QF PCR, 3. se quencing LPL promoter and 10 exons. Results: In LPLD patients, synonymous and nonsynonymous LPL sequence variants have been detected. In silico analysis have been performed to de termine the pathological status of sequence variants with uncertain signifi cance. Conclusion: It is currently possible to identified patients with LPLD caused by loss of function mutations in LPL gene, eligible for the introduction of treatment of the therapeutic LPL S447X gene.

25242,"Introduction The role of somatic mutations in the development of complex autoinflammatory diseases has barely been studied. We performed genetic testing for familiar monogenic autoinflammatory diseases in the case of an adult with late onset recurrent fever and severe upper abdominal pain. The patient was eventually clinically diagnosed with CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease based on capsule endoscopy and was treated successfully with an anti TNF blocker. Aim Study the rate and distribution of a novel and somatic mevalonate ki nase (MVK) gene mutation detected by Sanger sequencing, in a patient with CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease. Methods Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) of all MVK exons (2000 reads of target) was performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells, and followed by exon 3 fusion PCR MPS (10,000 reads per target) in DNA from neutrophils, and from FACS sorted T (CD3+), B (CD19+) and monocyte (CD14+) cells. Results The somatic mutation was detected in 22% of the MVK exon 3 reads and was confirmed to be the only mutation in the entire MVK coding region. The mosaicism rate was twice higher in DNA of CD14+ monocytes (50%) than in neutrophils (23%), B (17.6%) or T cells (21.7%).Conclusion This may be the first report of a somatic MVK mutation in the context of CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease. The mutation source was traced as far as a multi potential hematopoietic stem cell. However the mutation appeared to ex pand in circulating CD14+ monocytes despite effective anti TNF treatment. The pathogenic and auto inflammatory significance of this monocyte sub population remains to be studied.",2016
25243,"Introduction: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. It is characterized by early onset (<25 years of age), non obese and non auto immune mediated associated diabetes and accounts for 1 5% of all diabetic patients. Differentiation of the various subtypes allows an optimal treat ment and delay of diabetes related complications. Mutations in at least 13 genes are responsible for MODY and therefore mutation analysis of all genes in one next generation sequencing experiment seems an optimal diagnostic strategy. Materials en Methods: All coding exons and at least 20 bp of flanking in tronic sequences were enriched using the Agilent SureSelectXT Inherited Disease Panel, followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq2000. Data analysis was performed using a home made pipeline for MODY related genes. Results: High quality sequence data was obtained. Variant analysis using a low stringency analysis pipeline revealed a pathogenic mutation in 10 out of 69 patients in GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A or HNF1B. In addition, 4 possibly patho genic mutations were found in ABCC8 and KLF11, genes that are not routi nely tested in MODY patients. Conclusions: This approach gives a mutation detection ratio comparable to Sanger Sequencing. The procedure is fast and efficient and reveals mutati ons in genes that otherwise might not have been tested in a gene by gene approach.",2016
25244,"HNF1B heterozygous mutations are the cause of Ã¢ÂÂRenal Cysts and Diabetes SyndromeÃ¢ÂÂ, a clinically heterogeneous disorder characterized by maturity onset diabetes of the young, renal disease (cysts, small kidney, hyperurice mic nephropathy), liver test anomalies (cholestasis) and abnormalities of the genital tract. In the last 4 years, we tested 29 patients for a suspected HNF1B related dis order. Through sequencing and MLPA analysis, we identified a mutation in 14 patients from 11 unrelated families. Six patients carried large deletions involving the whole gene (de novo in three patients with available parental DNA). One carried an intragenic deletion (exon 1 to 4). One had a splicing mutation. One had a promoter variant of uncertain significance. Five pati ents from 2 unrelated families carried missense mutations. No typical clinical presentation can be described. Patients with loss of func tion mutations (gene deletions and splicing) tend to have an earlier onset of symptoms, with hyperechogenic kidneys detected in the antenatal period and congenital urinary and/or genital malformation. Progression of kidney disease appears to be slow. All adult patients had diabetes mellitus or glu cose intolerance. Two had cholestasis and two developed unexplained liver cirrhosis at a relatively young age (39 and 44 years). A 21 year old woman also had mild developmental delay: after MLPA analysis that identified an HFN1B deletion, array CGH was performed and a large (1.3 Mb) deletion was found. In conclusion, we confirm the wide phenotypic heterogeneity of HNF1B related disorders, but we point out that liver disease can be a major com plication in patients.",2016
25245,"Introduction: Nephrolithiasis is a prevalent condition with high morbidity. Heritability accounts for 56% of the disease incidence. Patients often pre sent with acute flank pain and dysuria that necessitates surgical interven tion. High concordance rate among monozygotic twins suggest a strong genetic component. Recent studies on monogenic cause of nephrolithiasis identified that dominant mutations are more frequent in adult onset kidney stones. We sought to identify pathogenic mutations underlying late onset nephrolithiasis in two pedigrees with recurrent stone formers. Materials and Methods: 6 adults from two pedigrees with multiple stone formers were recruited. Biochemical markers of renal function were com prehensively analysed and genetic diagnosis carried out by whole exome sequencing. Results: Based on segregation pattern, deleteriousness (Phylop and Gerp++ scores) and scarcity of variant (MAFÃ¢ÂÂ¤0.02) both in the reference popula tion and in the in house database, two missense mutations in ADCY10 (p. P1200L) and SLC25A25 (p. Q349H) were identified to underlie the condition in pedigree 1 and 2 respectively. Conclusion: ADCY10 encodes a unique class of adenylyl cycliseses. Varia tion at this gene has been already proposed to underlie absorptive hyper calciuria. We identified a rare missense mutation in exon 26 of ADCY10 (c. C3599T) that co segregate with nephrolithiasis in pedigree 1. Fur thermore, WES analysis revealed that a missense mutation in exon 8 of SLC25A25 (c. G1047C) co segregate with nephrolithiasis in pedigree 2. SL C25A25 encodes a calcium binding carrier that regulates uptake or efflux of adenine nucleotides into or from mitochondria. Our in silico analysis sugge sted that variants involved in Ca 2+/PO4 3 metabolism and purine metabolism contribute to hereditary nephrolithiasis and their functional impact merit further investigation.",2016

Approximately 20% of the patients do not respond to treatment with steroids and are classified as steroid resistant (SRNS). A significant number of SRNS cases are caused by inherited mutations in proteins that form the glomerular filtration barrier. The aim of this study was to search for mutations in a SRNS familial case, using whole exome sequencing (WES), as this method has become a tool of choice for genetic screening in diseases with high genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability such as SRNS. Material and Methods: WES was performed in one familial SRNS case. NPHS1 , NPHS2 and WT1 mutations had been already excluded after Sanger sequencing. We used strict genetic criteria for reduction of variants. Sanger sequencing was performed in order to confirm the mutation identified. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25247,"Introduction: Genetic features of Chronic Pancreatitis (CP) have been ex tensively investigated mainly testing genes associated to the trypsinogen activation pathway. However, different molecular pathways involving other genes may be implicated in the pathogenesis of CP .Materials and Methods: 81 patients with Idiopathic CP have been investi gated using Next Generation Sequencing approach with a panel of 70 genes related to six different pancreatic pathways: premature activation of tryp sinogen; modifier genes of Cystic Fibrosis phenotype; pancreatic secretion and ion homeostasis; Calcium signalling and zymogen granules exocytosis; autophagy; autoimmune pancreatitis related genes. Results: We found mutations in 34 out of 70 genes examined. 65/81 patients (80.2%) were positive for mutations in one or more genes, 16/81 patients (19.8%) had no mutations. Mutations in the CFTR (Cystic fibrosis trans membrane conductance regulator) gene were detected in 33/81 patients (40.7%) and 23 of them exhibited at least one mutation in genes of other pancreatic pathways. Of the remaining 48 patients, 13/81 (16%) had mu tations in genes involved in premature activation of trypsinogen and 19/81 (23.5%) had mutations only in genes of the other pathways: 40/65 patients positives for mutations showed variants in two or more genes (61.5%).Conclusions: Our data suggest a high rate of genetic heterogeneity in chronic pancreatitis and that trans heterozygosity may predispose to the Idiopathic CP phenotype.",2016
25248,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD;# 173900 and #613095) is the most common inherited kidney disease and is characte rized by the development and progressive enlargement of cysts in kidneys and other organs, eventually leading to end stage renal disease and usually a late onset multisystem disorder characterized by bilateral renal cysts. AD PKD is caused by mutations in the PKD1 gene (*601313) in approximately 85% of the cases and in the PKD2 gene (*173910) in the remaining 15%. The genetic diagnosis of this disease is very difficult due to the existence of 5 pseudogenes with high resemblance (98%) to the PKD1 gene. We have developed, validated, and carried out a methodology based on a long PCR followed by several internal PCRs that allows specific and accura te analysis of the entire PKD1 gene while avoiding the amplification of the pseudogenes. We used this long PCR approach for the analysis of the PKD1 gene in more than 100 ADPKD families. This procedure allowed the identification of the disease causing mutation in 75,3% of our patients. The vast majority of the mutations detected are null variants (nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice sites).According to the results produced in this study, a high percentage of ADPKD cases is associated with mutations in the PKD1 gene. Specific sequencing of the PKD1 is the most efficient approach to determine the molecular cause of the disease in ADPKD patients. An accurate genetic diagnosis is essential to provide reproductive options to ADPKD patients and their families in addi tion to appropriate genetic counselling.",2016
25249,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder with extensive genetic heterogeneity and is estimated to affect 1 in 15,000 to 30,000 individuals. It usually comes to medical attention because of re current pneumonia, otitis media and upper respiratory tract infections early in the life, or, in the adult male, infertility. Respiratory infections are caused by defective mucociliary clearance due to immotile or dysmotile respiratory cilia with or without ultrastructural defects. In this study, we analyzed 6 patients from Serbia with diagnosis of PCD ac cording to clinical presentation. We used a NGS panel with 4813 genes to detect disease causing mutations in this patients. We have detected vari ants in 6 different genes. In each patient only one gene was affected. Va riants were detected in the genes previously associated with PCD: DNAL1 (c.347A>T , c.350T>G and c.485G>A), LRRC6 (c.27T>G and 1397T>C), DNAH11 (c.7798C>T , c.8555C>G), DNAH5 (c.1137C>T , c.7624T>C, c.4356 2A>G) and CCDC40 (c.

25250,"Context: The term pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) was coined to descri be the clinical condition resulting from end organ resistance to parathor mone (rPTH), caused by (epi)genetic alterations within or upstream GNAS. Though knowledge is growing, there are few data on the prevalence of un derlying (epi)genetic defects. Objective: To ascertain the relative prevalence of PHP associated molecular defects. Design: With a special questionnaire, we collected data from patients (n,407) clinically and molecularly characterized by the EuroPHP network. Results: Isolated rPTH (31%) was caused only by epigenetic defects, 70% of patients showing loss of imprinting affecting all four GNAS differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 30% loss of methylation restricted to the GNAS A/B:TSS DMR. Multihormone resistance without AlbrightÃ¢ÂÂs heredita ry osteodystrophy (AHO) (15%) was essentially due to epigenetic defects, although 10% had point mutations. In patients with rPTH and AHO (10%), the rate of point mutations was hig her (28%) and methylation defects lower (70%). Patients with multihormo ne resistance and AHO (38%), presented all types of molecular defects with different frequencies. Finally, isolated AHO (4%) and progressive osseous heteroplasia (2%) were exclusively caused by point mutations.

Extreme hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides >10 mmol/L) is associated with chylomicronemia (CM) and increased risk of RAP . The re currence of pancreatitis episodes varies significantly between CM patients. We have investigated the gene expression profiles of adult patients with CM in a spectrum of RAP .Materials and Methods: A total of 62 subjects participated in this study: 15 healthy controls and 47 CM subjects divided into three groups: 0 (n,21), 1 3 (n,10) or Ã¢ÂÂ¥4 (n,16) acute pancreatitis episodes. Whole blood RNA samples were hybridized on Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array. After RMA norma lization, differential expression moderated T tests (Bioconductor package Limma) and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses were performed. Results: At a p value <0.01, a FDR of 5% (Benjamini Hochberg method) and a >2 fold change expression significance levels, a set of 41 probes have been found differentially expressed in CM subjects with no pancreatitis, 103 in the CM group with 1 to 3 pancreatitis, and 94 in the group with Ã¢ÂÂ¥4 pancrea titis compared to controls. Of the identified annotated probes, 14 are shared by all CM groups; 3 are specific to CM with no pancreatitis; 11 are specific to CM with 1 to 3 pancreatitis, and 17 are specific to CM with Ã¢ÂÂ¥4 pancreatitis.

The aim of our study was to search for the genetic etiology. Materials and Methods: The whole exome (SureSelect V4+UTR, Agilent) sequencing was performed (HiSeq2000, Illumina) in the two patients and their parents. Variant filtering included MAF<0.01, autosomal recessive mode of inheritance conditions and pedigree analysis. Candidate variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and their pathogenicity was tested by in silico analyses. Results: In both affected sisters, two novel heterozygous RFX6 variants were identified: c.1316_1319delTCTA (p. I439Tfs*13) and c.1154G>A (p. R385Q). Each was inherited from another unaffected parent. Both variants were found to be pathogenic by in silico analyses. Mutations in the gene RFX6 are associated with neonatal diabetes, pancreatic and biliary hypoplasia and duodenal/jejunal atresia classified as the Mitchell Riley syndrome (MRS) with autosomal recessive type of inheritance.

Moreover, a recent gene expression study confirmed the expression of Klotho in renal distal tubular cells. Aim of the study: To evaluate the role of Klotho polymorphisms in human essential hypertension and salt sensitivity. Design and Methods: 32 SNPs in Klotho gene identified with a previous GWA were used in the genetic analysis. Selected SNPs were studied in three dif ferent clinical settings: 1. Pressure natriuresis relationship (PNat) in 580 naive essential hypertensive patients, never treated before, (NHP) by Acu te salt load (NaLoad: 310 mMol in 2 h iv), 2. Low salt diet (137 pts, Low SD: <100 mEq/die for 15 days), and 3. Follow up cohort (FUP , median 150 months) of 230 hypertensive patients. Results: 15 SNPs (with tagging rÃÂ²,0.80) out of 32 were selected in the iden tified gene region. Six of these resulted significantly associated to BP varia tion after Naload and/or LowSD and/or FUP . Particularly, the genotypes in a missense mutation in exon 2 were associated to salt sensitivity (SBP variation and PNat after Na load) and decrease in kidney function in FUP confirming the similar effect in the two different clinical settings.

25254,"Introduction: The SERPINA1 gene encodes for Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT), an acute phase glycoprotein that inhibits Neutrophil Elastase (NHE). Muta tions in this gene cause reduced levels of AAT in the plasma, Alpha 1 Anti trypsin Deficiency (AATD), and reduced inhibition of NHE leads to emphy sema. Moreover, mutated forms of AAT can aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes causing hepatotoxicity and liver disease. AATD is characterized by high allelic heterogeneity, asking for a way to discriminate functionally impaired alleles as new missense variants are observed in the gene. Methods: By combining CADD score, amino acid conservation, protein struc ture modeling and alignment with other SERPIN polypeptides, we have de veloped a computational strategy to identify missense variations that could result in impaired protein function. We tested our strategy against the group of already characterized pathogenic missense mutations to assess specifi city and sensibility of the method. This approach has then been applied to missense variants reported in human population from the ExAc 0.3 databa se (~63.000 exomes) to identify candidate missense mutations for functio nal studies. Results: Our strategy performed well to correctly classify already known pathogenic mutations. When applied to ExAc 0.3 data, it identified 8 yet un characterized missense variants with high probability to affect the SERPI NA1 protein function. These variants could represent new rare pathogenic alleles diffused in the human population. Functional consequences of these mutations are being evaluated by in vitro studies. Conclusions: We have developed a computational strategy useful to prioriti ze new pathogenic variants in the SERPINA1 gene and identify new poten tial pathogenic alleles.",2016

The epidemiological data indicates its prevalence as 1 out of 50,000 to 100,000 live births in western population, while it is estimated to be greater in Arab ethnic families due to high rate of consanguinity. Genetic studies have found the association of EPCAM and SPINT2 genes mutation in disease etiology. Materials and Methods: Sanger DNA sequencing was carried out for the ge netic screening of EPCAM gene in affected and corresponding normal family members. The study was approved by ethical committee and sample was obtained after informed written consent. Results: Two consanguineous Qatari families were enrolled in the present study and sanger sequencing of all coding exons in EPCAM gene was per formed. The sequence analysis revealed c.498_499insC mutation in exon 5, which presumably truncates the protein synthesis (p. Gln167Profs*21). This truncation predictably removes the C terminal domain of EPCAM protein, which is suggestively involved in the attachment of EPCAM protein to intra cellular membrane. Conclusion: The identified mutation, c.498_499insC, seems to have founder effect in Arab population because it has previously been reported in a Qa tari, Kuwaiti and Saudi families. The present molecular study has evidenced this mutation as a genetic hotspot and suggests to formulate a molecular diagnostic test in Qatari families, affected with tufting enteropathy, for ge netic counseling.",2016
25257,"Introduction. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism, caused by mutations in gene ATP7B. Although WD is established as monogenic disorder, heterogeneity in phenotype is observed even among patients possessing the same type of mutations in gene ATP7B. One of the candidate genes which might play the role of a modifier locus is COMMD1 (former MURR1).Materials and methods. 54 patients, clinically diagnosed with WD (LeipzigÃ¢ÂÂs Score, 2001) were tested for mutations in ATP7B gene: by PCR Bi PASA and direct sequencing (for other mutations); and for possible changes in gene COMMD1 by direct sequencing of its three exons. Results. Wilson disease was genetically confirmed in 42 patients. In total 82.4% of WD patientsÃ¢ÂÂ alleles were identified: H1069Q (72.22%); M769H fs*26 (1.85%); Val73GlufsX4 (1.85%) and D1267G, D765N, M645R (0.93% for each); 27.78% of the alleles remained unidentified. Three nucleotide changes were identified in COMMD1, of which two represented reported synonymous changes: rs55677935 and rs9096. The third one Ã¢ÂÂ two nu cleotide deletion in geneÃ¢ÂÂs regulatory region (rs569267407) was found only in two patients Ã¢ÂÂ siblings, showing different clinical symptoms Ã¢ÂÂ one dying from fulminant hepatitis at age of 17, the second Ã¢ÂÂ being asymptomatic at age of 19, when first being diagnosed with WD due to family screening. Conclusions.1) There were no variants in gene COMMD1 found that could be related to different phenotype of WD patients;2) Change found in COMMD1 regulatory part could be a cause for different protein activity, but the clinical significance remains unclear.

25259,"Background: Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE; MIM #201100) is a rare and severe autosomal recessive zinc deficiency disorder molecularly diagnosed by the identification of a biallelic anomaly of zinc transporter gene SLC39A4. Its pathognomonic symptom is an acral and periorificial dermatitis occur ring in early life that responds in a spectacular fashion to zinc therapy. Yet, our experience in the molecular diagnosis of AE showed that more than a half of the cases of suspected AE were not due to a primary zinc dyshomeo stasis that would be associated by alterations of SLC39A4.Purpose: Our goal was to determine the genetic cause of genodermatoses very suggestive of an AE, albeit with no SLC39A4 mutation. Method: We sequenced the whole exome of a series of simplex and multi plex families with a AE like dermatitis. Results: Beside the identification of a few exceedingly rare syndromes mi micking AE, the most striking result was the presence of dominant muta tions in filaggrin and in laminins, some of them were already known to be associated with an increased susceptibility to atopic dermatitis (AD).Conclusions: Our work highlighted atopic dermatitis as the main clinical diagnosis of AE. This suggests that a sub group of the common disease re presented by AD could be diagnosed by genetic testing. Further studies are needed to determine whether these severe cases of AD are exceptional or if the efficiency of zinc therapy can be extended to the treatment of all AD patients with similar anomalies.",2016
25260,"Background: Zinc is a key factor of various biological processes. Intestinal absorption is the critical step of zinc homeostasis regulation. Acroderma titis enteropathica is a rare cause of hereditary zinc deficiency. Mutations in SLC39A4, coding a transmembrane zinc transporter, mainly expressed in enterocytes, have been described in Acrodermatitis enteropathica patients. Since its identification by our group in 2002, clinical molecular testing for SLC39A4 mutations is available. However, functional consequences of SL C39A4 mutations are poorly characterized. In these conditions, assessment of pathogenicity of newly identified variants of unknown significance re mains challenging. Methods : We evaluated the effects of missense SLC39A4 mutations in HeLa cells transfected with wild type or mutated, hemagglutinin tagged, SLC39A4 transcript. To model decrease of transport activity by SLC39A4, we perfor med time lapse measurements of zinc cytoplasmic levels. Finally, the effects of putative splice site mutations were tested by minigene assay. Results: Disruption of SLC39A4 membrane trafficking has been showed in 8 missense mutations, located in N terminal extracellular domain of the transporter. Effect on splicing of c.192 G>C mutation of exon 1 of SLC39A4 has been confirmed. We propose a strategy to quantify zinc transport to in vestigate consequences of mutations without effect on SLC39A4 localizati on. Conclusion: Functional assessment of SLC39A4 mutational spectrum provi des key information for interpreting the significance of pathogenicity in the daily practice of a molecular biology laboratory.",2016
25261," Introduction: Heterozygous aggrecan (ACAN) mutations have been report ed to cause short stature with bone age (BA) acceleration and premature growth cessation. In order to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and the response to growth promoting therapies, a detailed clinical evaluation of 66 individuals from 12 families with ACAN mutations, 7 novel truncations, 5 missense, was performed. Results: Adults have mildly disproportionate short stature (SDS median: 3.3, range: 0.9 to 4.5) with normal/slightly elevated sitting height indices (SDS median:2.1, range:0.4 3.8) and early growth cessation and/or lack of pu bertal growth spurt. Growth of upper extremities appears less affected with arm spans typically greater than height (arm span height: median:+5.5cm; range: 4 to +13). Some cases had osteochondritis dissecans and early onset osteoarthritis requiring knee joint and other large joints replacement sur geries in the 2nd 3rd decade. Two families had degenerative disc disease in the 4th decade. Prepubertal height is less affected (median SDS: 1.8, range: 1.0 to 4.2). In contrast to most children with short stature, many with ACAN mutations show an advanced BA (BA CA, median:+1.3yr; range:+0 to +3.5) reflecting a reduction in the remaining growth potential. Nine patients have been treat ed with rhGH and/or GnRH analogs or aromatase inhibitors. Conclusions: Heterozygous ACAN mutations result in a wide phenotypic spectrum ranging from mild and proportionate short stature to a distinct skeletal dysplasia with disproportionate short stature and brachydactyly. Some also cause articular/intervertebral disc cartilage dysfunction lead ing to early onset osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease requiring intervention. Careful monitoring of patients with ACAN mutations may help to identify important genotype phenotype correlations and to understand their pathogenicity.",2016

Results: Phagocytic activity of PMNs in response to non opsonized E.coli was significantly reduced in familial AgP patients compared to healthy sib lings and non related controls (p , 0.032). A similar reduction of phagocy tic activity could not be observed in sporadic AgP in the cohort compared to matched controls. In the family both directed and random migration of PMNs was significantly reduced in AgP patients compared to healthy con trols (p , 0.042 and p , 0.028, respectively). This significant reduction in chemotactic activity was not observed in cohort patients compared to mat ched controls. Conclusions: The differences in PMN function between familial AgP and the sporadic form suggest distinct pathophysiological pathways, although lea ding to a similar clinical presentation.

25263,"Background: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common hair loss disorder charac terized by a sudden onset of patchy areas of hair loss, which can occur on the scalp or elsewhere on the body. Immunological and genetic association studies support the hypothesis that AA is autoimmune in nature. Recent evi dence points to a significant role of miRNAs in autoimmune diseases;but the role of miRNAs in AA has not been investigated so far. Methods: We performed a systematic analysis to investigate whether com mon variantsamong all known autosomal microRNAs loci contribute to AA development. Gene based analyses were performed by VEGAS for all miRNAs listed in miRBase and their flanking sequences using the largest GWAS data set of 3,253 patients and 7,543 controls. Result: As a result, 78 of the 617 investigated microRNAs showed nominally significant p values. After correction for multiple testing, three microRNAs (miR 1237, miR 30b/d, miR 548h 2) showed significant association with AA. The most promising one was miR 30B. Target gene analyses for 3 di sease associated microRNAs revealed 2,072 nominally significant predicted target genes. Gene based p values were calculated for the predicted target genes revealing 42 of them to be significantly associated with AA after cor rection for multiple testing,including IL2RA, ERBB3 as genome wide signi ficant loci from former AA GWA studies. By luciferase assays, we validated the site specific regulation of IL2RA, STX17 and TNXBof miR 30B. Conclusion: Our study is the first to suggest the importance of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of AA which could be of interest for development of the rapies in the future.",2016
25264,"Introduction: It has been proposed that apoptosis is effective on interverte bral disc degeneration. Especially death receptor pathway and mitochondri al pathway are reported to have a significant role in apoptosis mechanism. This study is the first study in which both polymorphisms and expressions of apoptotic genes in patients with intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) are evaluated together. The aim of our study is to determine whether poly morphisms and expressions of apoptotic genes involved in both pathways are related with grades of IVDD or not. Materials and Methods: Blood and tissue samples of 100 patients diagnosed with lumbar disc degeneration were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their radiological degeneration grades as grade 2 (mild) and grade 3 and 4 (severe). Polymorphisms in Fas (rs 2234767), Bcl 2 (rs 1801018) and Bax (rs4645878) genes were determined with real time PCR. Expressions of these genes were analyzed immunohistochemically follo wing Histological Degeneration Scoring. Results: Whereas no relationship was found among polymorphisms of Fas and Bax genes and their expressions, we have determined a relationship among GG genotype of Bcl 2 and their expressions. Additionally, we have found that ratio of Bax positive cells is related with IVDD grades. In addition to this, we have found that radiological degeneration grades were compatib le with histological degeneration scores. Conclusions: GG genotype of Bcl 2 gene may influence the level of its expres sion and may be effective in development of IVDD. Additionally, expression of Bax gene may be related with different grades of IVDD.",2016
25265,"Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS, OMIM #208050) is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder characterized by tortuosity and elon gation of the large and medium sized arteries and a propensity towards an eurysm formation and vascular dissection. ATS is caused by mutations in SL C2A10 encoding the facilitative glucose transporter 10 (GLUT10). GLUT10 deficiency leads to the disarray of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to the activation of the TGFÃÂ² pathway, but the pathomechanisms of ATS is still an enigma. To discern the pathomechanisms underlying the ATS aetiology, we perfor med gene expression profiling and biochemical studies on skin fibroblasts. Transcriptome analyses revealed the dysregulation of several genes invol ved in TGFÃÂ² signalling and ECM homeostasis as well as the perturbation of specific pathways that control both the cell energy balance and the oxi dative stress response. Biochemical and functional studies showed a mar ked increase in ROS induced lipid peroxidation sustained by altered PPARÃÂ³ function, which contributes to the redox imbalance and the compensatory antioxidant activity of ALDH1A1. ATS fibroblasts also showed activation of a non canonical TGFÃÂ² signalling due to TGFBRI disorganization, the upregu lation of TGFBRII and connective tissue growth factor, and the activation of the ÃÂ±vÃÂ²3 integrin transduction pathway, which involves p125FAK, p60Src, and p38 MAPK. Stable GLUT10 expression in patientsÃ¢ÂÂ fibroblasts normali zed redox homeostasis and PPARÃÂ³ activity, rescued canonical TGFÃÂ² signal ling, and induced partial ECM re organization.

SRPIII is uniformly lethal due to pulmonary hypoplasia and other organ system abnormalities. To date, mutations in 11 genes, coding for ciliary proteins, have been reported in ATD/SRPIII. Here, we report the molecular screening of 71 individuals (53 ATD, 18 SRPIII) by targeted NGS of a customized ciliopathy gene panel, called ciliome. The ciliome allowed us to identify the molecular basis of 70% (50/71) of ATD/SRPIII cases. Mutations in DYNC2H1 were identified in 34/50 (68 %) and were not associated with kidney disease but with liver and retina in volvement. Mutations in other genes, namely IFT140 (6%), WDR60 (6%), IFT144 (6%), WDR34 (4%), IFT80 (2%), WDR35 (2%) and TTC21B (2%), were associated with multiple organ damage including kidney insuffici ency or liver cirrhosis illustrating the overlap with Saldino Mainzer and Sensenbrenner syndromes. We also identified one heterozygous mutation in DYNC2H1 and IFT140 for a living ATD case, supporting a digenism. We finally identified homozygous mutations in a new ciliary gene, KIF24, in two ATD sibling fetuses with renal, hepatic and pulmonary involvement. In the 21 families with no identified molecular bases, radiological features were typical and multi organ involvement variable. We conclude that DYNC2H1 is the major gene responsible for ATD/SRP III.

Its prevalence is 1 in 12 million live births. Bi allelic mutations in the responsible gene ATP6V0A2 lead to increased pH in Golgi, resulting in impaired glycosyltransferase activity and organelle traf ficking. Here we present a consanguineous family with four unaffected and two affected sibs (a male and a female) with microcephaly, dysmorphic fea tures, cleft lip/palate, vision/hearing impairment, wrinkled skin, tendency to infections, bleeding diathesis and defective wound healing. Materials and Methods: SNP genotype data were used to detect regions with homozygosity shared only by the patients. Exome sequence data for the in dex patient were used to search for a rare, homozygous deleterious muta tion in the possibly linking regions. Results: Linkage analysis pointed to a large region at 12q24.21 24.32 with a multipoint LOD score of 2.58 and including 198 genes. Causative muta tion search in linkage regions identified homozygous frameshift mutation p. S695RfsX12 (c.2083_2086del) in ATP6V0A2.

25268,"INTRODUCTION: Proteoglycans (PGs) are major components of the extra cellular matrix (ECM), and fulfill an essential role as both structural and regulatory biomacromolecules. They are composed of a core protein onto which one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains are covalently at tached. Specific deficiencies in the enzymes (XYL T1/2, B4GAL T7, B3GAL T6 and B3GAT3) involved in the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker re gion between the core protein and its GAGs are known as linkeropathies. RESULTS: We describe the clinical features of an infant from consanguineous parents from India, in whom we identified the previously reported homozy gous p.(Gly223Ser) (c.667G>A) missense mutation in B3GAT3 using whole exome sequencing. B3GAT3 encodes glucuronyltransferase 1, which adds the fourth saccharide to the linker region. The boy, who expired at age 2.5 months, displayed generalized cutis laxa, osteopenia and multiple perinatal fractures, adducted thumbs, bilateral club feet and large joint contractures, severe dysmorphic features, blue sclerae and corneal clouding. Structural modeling of the substitution shows that the mutation substitutes a nonpo lar Gly residue by a polar Ser residue in the catalytic pocket of the enzyme. Functional studies to further investigate the pathogenic consequences of the defect are ongoing on a cellular overexpression model of the mutant alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This is only the fifth reported child with a B3GAT3 muta tion. Two other missense mutations (p.(Arg277Gln) and p.(Pro140Leu)) have been reported.

We aimed at exploring the genetic variability and functionality of this locus . Firstly, we resequenced the FLJ42280 genomic region in two extreme BMD groups from the BARCOS cohort of postmenopausal women; we statistically compared the number and frequency of variants between the two groups, and we analyzed their overlap with functional elements from ENCODE. Se condly, we performed cis eQTLs analyses to determine whether the GWAs SNPs, and others in strong linkage disequilibrium with them, correlated with gene expression levels. We identified 110 variants, 18 of which were novel and 59 were low fre quency variants (LFV). The number of LFV was balanced between the two extreme groups and frequency differences of all variants were below the statistical power of the design, although 9 showed trend and are currently being genotyped in the complete BARCOS cohort.

The disease is diagnosed in young infants and is characterized by spontaneous resolution of the cortical thickening, with episodes of re currence and reduced penetrance. The underlying genetic cause is an unique recurrent arginine to cysteine substitution (p.(Arg1014Cys), c.3040C>T) in the helical domain of the ÃÂ±1 chain of type I collagen (COL1A1).We describe six unrelated probands with Caffey disease. Molecular analysis of COL1A1 confirmed heterozygosity for the c.3040C>T (p.(Arg1014Cys)) mutation in three probands. Biochemical collagen studies on one of these probandsÃ¢ÂÂ dermal fibroblasts showed intracellular ÃÂ±1(I)2 dimers, which are at least partly secreted into the extracellular matrix. In the remaining three probands a novel c.2752C>T nucleotide change (p.(Arg918Cys)) was identi fied. This mutation also causes the formation of ÃÂ±1(I)2 dimers, which were not secreted into the extracellular matrix. Although both arginine to cysteine substitutions are in relative close pro ximity, they affect different protein regions. While the p.(Arg1014Cys) maps to the gap region between two Major Ligand Binding Regions (MLBR2 3), the p.(Arg918Cys) is located within the cell interacting domain MLBR2, as sociated with (severe to )lethal Osteogenesis imperfecta.

Parallel developmental disorders in other species could provide complementary models for human rare diseases by unco vering new candidate genes, improving the understanding of the molecu lar mechanisms and opening possibilities for therapeutic trials. Our study investigated the clinico pathological features and genetic causes of three developmental syndromes in dogs; craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO), previously undescribed skeletal syndrome, and severe tooth wear due to hypomineralization. Materials and Methods: We established study cohorts for each disease and characterized their clinical features. Either a genome wide association stu dy combined with targeted resequencing or whole genome sequencing was utilized to identify the causal variants. Results: For the studied disorders, we identified pathogenic variants in the canine SLC37A2 , SCARF2 and FAM20C genes, respectively. CMO is a clinical equivalent to an infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease) for which SL C37A2 is a new candidate gene. SLC37A2 is a poorly characterized member of a glucose phosphate transporter family without previous disease associa tions. Mutations in SCARF2 and FAM20C have been associated with human van den Ende Gupta and Raine syndromes and our results demonstrate that the canine disorders show remarkable similarity to human syndromes.

CHH is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal involvement, short stature, variable features like blond fine sparse hair, and defective cellular immunity affecting T cell me diated responses. Patients may have a severe combined immunodeficiency requiring bone marrow transplantation or they may be asymptomatic. CHH is caused by mutations in the RMRP gene (RNA component of mitochondri al RNA processing endoribonuclease), an untranslated gene with only 267 nucleotides that encode an RNA subunit of an RNase MRP complex. This is the first nuclear encoded RNA in which mutations have been found to lead to human diseases. RMRP is characterized by a very high density of SNPs and several pathogenic variants.

We performed a comprehensive clinical and molecular assessment in a lar ge cohort of CCA patients to delineate clinical diagnostic criteria and guide molecular analyses for FBN2.FBN2 analysis using either Sanger Sequencing or PCR based next genera tion sequencing was performed in 122 clinically well characterized pro bands. For 10 clinical characteristics, the positive and negative predictive value to find an FBN2 mutation was determined in order to establish a weighted clinical scoring system on 20 points. Statistics were performed using SPSS 22.0.Forty seven probands harbored an FBN2 mutation (mutation uptake rate 39%). All but 2 mutations were located in the neonatal region (exons 22 36) with half of them altering or producing cysteines. Three patients had large intragenic deletions or frameshift mutations. Five FBN2+ patients de veloped cardiovascular complications. Logistic regression analysis reveals a significantly higher score in FBN2+ versus FBN2 patients (p<0,001). Cut point analysis using a ROC curve revealed that a clinical score of 11+ yields a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 60% for the FBN2 result. In addition, in patients presenting with a clinical score of 11+ and at least crumpled ears and arachnodactyly, the probability of finding an FBN2 mutation is 60%.BOF15/MET V/011; FWO:1881515N",2016

The gold stan dard for the diagnosis of OA is the histology of synovial cell. The synovial cell consists of from one to four layers of cells including fibroblast cell and several biomarkers for OA and chondrogenesis. For OA, the chondrocyte im plantation and osteochondral autograft procedures are used as treatment of methods which are expensive and have side effects. Another method is im plants being made of several materials can be used as knee implant. CHI3L1, COMP , MMP1, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, HIF1A, NFKB, EPAS1 genes are asso ciated with chondrogenesis and they are well known biomarkers for OA and chondrogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to determine the invitro cytotoxicity and the level of mentioned genes expressions of synthesized Mg Y RE12, Mg Y RE13 and Mg Y RE24 alloys by Micro/Nano Mechanical Characterization Laboratory of Physic department as implant materials. HEL299 which is the fibroblast cell line as model of synovial fibroblast is used. For this purpose, HEL299 was exposed to various concentrations of Mg Y RE12, Mg Y RE13 and Mg Y RE24 at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT . The expression levels of genes were evaluated with qRT PCR. To compa re control and exposed HEL299 cell line, Mg Y RE12 suppressed COMP , ADAMTS5, HIF1A, NFKB and EPAS1 genes, Mg Y RE13 suppressed CHI3L1, ADAMTS5, HIF1A, NFKB, EPAS1 genes and Mg Y RE24 suppressed CHI3L1, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, MMP1, HIF1A, NFKB, EPAS1 genes.

25278," Introduction: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD, MIM#119600) is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by hypoplasia/aplasia of the cla vicles, delayed closure of the cranial sutures and multiple dental abnorma lities. Other features that may be present are macrocephaly, brachycephaly and bossing, short stature and other skeletal abnormalities. The prevalence of CCD is one in 1 million. Mutations in the RUNX2 gene are responsible for 60 70% of the cases (~40% are de novo). The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological findings and may be confirmed by RUNX2 gene mutation analysis. Materials and Methods: We report 5 CCD patients (4 families), in which RUNX2 sequence analysis was performed. Results: All the patients presented with typical clinical features and spe cific radiological findings. The RUNX2 gene molecular study revealed 2 missense mutations (in 2 families) affecting highly conserved amino acids p. Arg190Trp and p. Lys218Asn. The later represents a novel base substitu tion (c.654A>C), located in the DNA binding Runt domain. Further studies will be performed in the other 2 families. Conclusions: These cases illustrate the importance of clinical clues for the diagnosis, as well as the intra and interfamilial variability of this disease. The molecular confirmation allowed a more accurate genetic counselling for patients and families, namely by the opportunity to offer prenatal diagnosis. Although CCD has an overall good prognosis, its earlier diagnosis may lead to a better management from a multidisciplinary team thereby providing an improved quality of life for patients.",2016
25279,"Introduction: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD; MIM 119600) is a rare autoso mal dominant inherited disorder that causes an abnormal skeletal genesis characterized by short stature, absent or delayed closure of cranial sutures, hypoplastic or absent clavicles, and dental anomalies, such as delayed tooth eruption of permanent teeth, hypodontia, and supernumerary teeth. It has been demonstrated that hypomorphic or haploinsufficiency of the runt re lated transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene is causative for CCD. RUNX2 en codes an osteoblast specific transcription factor, which recognizes specific DNA sequences via the runt domain, and has an important role in the diffe rentiation of osteoblasts and the maturation of chondrocytes. Materials and Methods:Mutational analysis was performed with fragments covering the entire coding region of the RUNX2 gene. In addition, biochemical analyses were carried out to investigate the role of detected mutant RUNX2 in the CCD pa thologies. Results and Conclusions:In this study we described the case of a 9 year old Japanese boy with CCD who carries a novel mutation in the RUNX2 gene (c.473c>a) that resulted in an amino acid substitution (p. A158E) in the runt domain of the gene pro duct. Although A158E RUNX2 showed stable exogenous expression in trans fected COS7 cells and a normal nuclear localization pattern, it did not show transcriptional activity in a reporter assay. This indicates that the A158E mutation in RUNX2 is causal for the CCD in our current case.",2016
25280,"Introduction: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by skeletal fragility leading to recurrent fractures. It is mainly an autosomal dominant disorder with 85 90% of cases having mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 . The objective of this study was to identify mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 in patients with clinical suspicion of OI. Material and Methods: The coding regions of COL1A1 and COL1A2 were screened in 47 families with OI by next generation sequencing (NGS). Most families were Spanish, but patients from other countries were included. We confirmed the mutations by conventional Sanger sequencing. Familial ana lysis were performed when samples were available. Results: We identified 28 different pathogenic mutations in 31 families (68%). Most common mutations were missense variants affecting glycine residues but splicing and frameshift mutations were also found. There were 12 novel mutations (COL1A1 ,6; COL1A2 ,6) and eight mutations were con firmed to be de novo. Conclusions: NGS is a suitable method to accomplish molecular diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta. Large deletions/duplications and deep intronic mutations which were not analysed in this study could explain the low rate of mutation detection. The large majority of pathogenic variants identified were missense muta tions affecting glycine residues and thus expected to cause collagen I triple helix disturbance.",2016

Genetic factors are known as contributors to its patho genesis. Up to date, a large number of genes were involved in this process, such as PITX1, TBX4 and RBM10. Our aim was to determine the candidate disease causing mutations in Chinese patients with isolated clubfoot. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of isolated clubfoot pedigree and 53 sporadic patients. Whole exo me sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were performed for identifing disease causing mutations and validation, respectively. Results: A putative pathogenic mutation c.4717G>T (p. D1573Y) in filamin B (FLNB) gene was successfully identified by WES and was shown to co segre gate with the family anomaly in a three generation family with six isolated clubfoot affected individuals. In addition, two novel missense mutations in FLNB [c.1897A>G(p. M633V) and c.2195A>G(p. Y732C)] were further iden tified from 53 sporadic patients with isolated clubfoot. Conclusions: Our results indicated that FLNB mutations were associated with isolated clubfoot,and provide a concrete evidence for involvement of FLNB in pathogenesis of isolated clubfoot and expand the clinical spectrum of FLNB mutations.",2016

These are mesenchymal gaps that bridge the gaps among flat bones of the skull, and serve as key growth centers coordi nating skull brain concerted development. The suture mesenchyme houses a craniofacial specific skeletal stem cell niche, recently characterized. Re cent evidence suggests that NSC is due to a stem cell abnormality at this site. Our aim is to characterize the stem cell population isolated from open and fused sutures of NSC patients, focusing on the expression of lineage specific markers. Cavarial stem cells (CMSC) were isolated from NSC biospecimens and clonal ly diluted. The expression of bone marrow stem cell markers (THY1, a skel etal stemness marker; TIE2, tyrosine kinase recognized as haemopoietic/angiogenic marker; ENPEP , glutamyl aminopeptidase involved in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells; and ITGAV, an integrin playing a key role in bone marrow niche environment) was analyzed both in suture tissues and matched cell clones, with and without osteogenic induction. CMSCs clones homogeneously displayed a THY1+/TIE2 /ENPEP immuno phenotype, indicating that explant cultures allow a significant selection of cell populations for both sutures and synostoses.

25283,"Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NSC) is a congenital malformation due to the premature ossification of calvarial sutures, with an unclear multifactori al etiopathogenesis. The Bardet Biedl Syndrome associated gene 9 (BBS9), encoding a structural component of the primary cilium, has been associated to the NSC phenotype in a GWAS. The role of BBS9 in the osteogenic commit ment and differentiation of somatic stem cells inside skull bone and sutures is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how BBS9 modulation affect cilio genesis and osteogenesis, in cells isolated from fused (p CMSC) and unfused (n CMSC) sutures of NSC patients. Cells were cultured either in standard growth or in osteoinductive conditi ons; BBS9 was silenced using siRNA, and its expression analyzed through qPCR. The number of primary cilium expressing cells, and the activity of the cilium related Hedgehog pathway were analyzed comparatively in all cells. BBS9 expression was higher in p CMSC compared with n CMSC, and under went a further increase upon osteogenic induction. The number of ciliated cells was lower in p CMSC compared with n CMSC. Following BBS9 silen cing, the percentage of ciliated cells raised significantly in p CMSC, equali zing to the percentage observed in n CMSC. Furthermore, the expression of Hedgehog pathway related genes (SMO, GLI1, GLI3, IGF1) in p CMSC was significantly dysregulated, compared with n CMSC, and reverted to normal upon BBS9 silencing. Taken together, our data point towards a functional role of BBS9 in the osteogenic commitment of suture derived cells, highlighting a key role of the primary cilium in the abnormal osteogenic process underlying NSC pa thogenesis.",2016
25284,"Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NCS) is a congenital malformation, with unclear etiopathogenesis, due to premature suture fusion, which alters skull brain landmarks. Cognitive impairment, typically involving the langua ge domain, has been reproducibly found in NCS patients. In a paleoneurobiology perspective, the skull of anatomically modern hu mans (AMHs) has evolved to a more globular shape, compared to Neandert hals, while improving cognition and linguistic abilities. Recent studies from our group pointed out that critical genes have been selected in AMHs and should be crucial for skull globularization, while playing a putative role in neurogenesis, neo cortex and subcortical patterning, neuronal interconnec tion, and synaptic plasticity. Hence we aimed to investigate the role of candidate genes for skull globula rity in the premature ossification of calvarial sutures occurring in NCS, cho sen as a model disease. To this aim, these selected genes were comparatively analyzed through qPCR in sutures of NCS patients versus control samples from unaffected in dividuals. Differential expression of DLX5, ROBO1, SLIT2, NCAM1, TGFB2, DCN, RUNX2, and SFRP2 was found. The expression levels of these genes was also significantly modulated in cells induced towards osteogenic diffe rentiation in vitro. Taken together our data seem to suggest that the molecular signaling ac ting at the site of premature suture fusion in NCS partially overlaps with the gene regulatory network that shaped the skull and the brain during human evolution and that improved our cognitive abilities. We claim that this over lapping may be informative of the common molecular machinery regulating the skull brain concerted development and evolution.",2016
25285,"Introduction. Cutis laxa (CL) is a rare disorder of elastic fibers and is cha racterized by lax skin, skeletal and developmental anomalies. Several forms have been described. ARCL2A (OMIM 219200) presents lax skin with per sistent wide fontanels, intrauterine growth retardation, hip dislocation, scoliosis, and inguinal hernia. A subgroup of patients with ATP6V0A2 gene mutations have also metabolic problems mostly N and O glycan biosynthe sis defect. Here we present two cases of ARCL2A both with homozygous ATP6V0A2 gene mutations, in one of whom, ethylmalonic aciduria was also observed. Case I. A 6 year old male patient from consanguineous parents was referred because of lax skin and a previous sib affected with CL. He showed a large fontanel and lax skin. Mutation analysis revealed homozygous ATP6V0A2 gene mutations, (c.187C>T , p. R63X). No mutations were identified in the FBLN5 gene. Case 2 was a 17 day old baby with facial dysmorphism, congenital hip dysplasia, a wide anterior fontanel, lax skin and pectus excavatum. Muta tion analysis revealed homozygous nonsense ATP6V0A2 gene mutation, (c.187C>T , p. R63X). During follow up, urine organic acid screening tested because of developmental delay, revealed high levels of ethylmalonic acidu ria. A repeated analysis supported the same result. DISCUSSION: To best of our knowledge no previous association of cutis laxa syndrome with ethylmalonic aciduria has been reported. Increased ethyl malonic acid in urine is observed in a number of inborn errors of metabo lism, as well as in people with the SCAD coding region polymorphism.

25286,"Patients with germline mutations in CYLD are recognised to develop a range of patterns of presentation, including familial cylindromatosis (FC), Brooke Spiegler Syndrome (BSS) and multiple familial trichoepitheliomas (MFT). Here we present a case of a 29 year old female patient with multiple facial and genital papules, a pattern not previously associated with CYLD muta tion. The patient began to develop multiple, asymptomatic, skin coloured papu les around the nose and upper lip from the age of 16. There was no family history of skin tumours. White, firm papules began to develop within the labia majora from the age of 25, and numbered more than 20. A biopsy of the facial lesions showed trichoepithelioma. The labial lesions demonstrated hi stological features consistent with epidermoid cysts. Sanger sequencing of the coding exons of CYLD revealed a novel heterozygous base duplication in exon 8, c.966dupG, resulting in a frameshift mutation. Pubic tumours are a feature recognised in CYLD mutation carriers, and one that challenges the paradigm of ultraviolet radiation induced tumour in duction. We undertook local review of records from four further patients carrying a CYLD mutation (c.2460delC) who had undergone excision of ge nital lesions, and none were found to have epidermoid cysts. A search of the literature did not reveal this pattern of presentation in other patients with CYLD mutations. MFT may be genetically heterogeneous, with only 44% of patients demon strating germline mutations in CYLD. Our finding of MFT and labial cysts may represent an infrequent, novel pattern of presentation associated with CYLD mutation.",2016

However, detailed analysis of the deleted region pointed at candidate gene XYLT1, a gene reported to be associated with skeletal development. Sequence analysis was performed on the remaining allele and identified a small intragenic deletion, originating from his father. Subsequent RNA studies using NGS technology revealed se veral out of frame transcripts. XYLT1 mutations have recently been reported as causative in recessive Des buquois skeletal dysplasia (DBSD), but the skeletal features in our patient do not fit this diagnosis.

25288,"Introduction. Inherited desmosomal diseases are characterized by skin and/or cardiac features. The dermatological features might be a clue in the determination of the underlying life threatening cardiac disease. We propo se a clinical algorithm in order to identify the patients at high risk of cardiac involvement and to orientate gene sequencing. Methods. Systematic review of published articles. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were: 1) at least one identified mutation in the following desmoso mal genes: JUP; PKP1, PKP2, DSP , DSG1 to 4, DSC1 3 and CDSN; 2) Descripti on of the dermatological phenotype. Results. 78 articles fulfilling the criteria were published. They correspond to 458 patients. Palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), hair shaft anomalies (HSA), and skin fragility were the major features. Isolated PPK or isolated HSA are associated to a desmosomal disease limited to skin. The combination of PPK and HSA was recorded in 161 patients, and this association is at high risk of cardiac disease (129/161 patients, 80.1%). Skin features appeared as the initial clinical manifestations in the majority of cases. However, they had led to cardiac monitoring in only 2.3% of those patients. We delineated three major phenotypes: the PPK HSA non fragile skin subtype (77%), always associated to cardiac involvement; the PPK HSA skin fragility normal cardiac function subtype (19.9%) frequently associated Plakophillin1 ano malies; the PPK HSA skin fragility cardiac involvement subtype (3.1%) always due to DSP mutations.

In this study we investigated 8 patients belonging to 3 related Tunisian fa milies with autosomal recessive DUH presents with punctuate palmoplan tar keratosis (PPK). To find the causative gene, we performed homozygosity mapping followed by trio whole exome sequencing. In the mapped candidate locus on chromosome 6q, a unique single nucleoti de variant in the ENPP1 gene was identified. Sanger sequencing confirmed the segregation of this variant (c.358T>C; p.

ENPP1 encodes the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phos phodiesterase 1, a cell surface enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and generates extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate. ENPP1 has been shown to play a role in skin pigmentation as the underlying cause for domi nant Cole disease. Whereas Cole Disease mutations are heterozygous and affect conserved cysteine residues In the SMB2 domain of ENPP1, this novel Cys120 missense mutation is located in the SMB1 domain and must be in the homozygous state to cause DUH.

25291,"Introduction: Proteoglycans are found on the surface of animal cells and in the extracellular matrix. They consist of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains attached to a core protein through a linker region. Biallelic mutations in B4GAL T7, the gene encoding galactosyltransferase I (ÃÂ²4GalT7) which is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker region, are the cause of the rare progeroid variant of the Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS). This disorder, which lacks a relevant in vivo animal model, is mainly characterized by short stature, hypotonia, a progeroid facial appearance and skeletal abnormalities. Methods: We developed and characterized a knockdown (KD) zebrafish mo del for the progeroid type of EDS by using morpholino injections targeted against b4galt7. Results: Morphant embryos showed morphological abnormalities such as a small, round head, withdrawn jaw, more front facing eyes and mild develop mental delay compared to wild type and negative control embyos. The total amount of sulfated GAGs was severely reduced in morphant embryos and whole mount immunohistochemistry showed that heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were severely diminished in the heads of b4galt7 KD embryos. In addition, alcian blue staining demonstrated that cartilage struc ture in the head of morphant embryos are absent or strongly misshapen and immunohistochemical staining revealed a disturbed filamentous actine pattern in their head and tail. Conclusion: A b4galt7 KD zebrafish model has been developed which seems to be specific as it mimics partly the human phenotype of patients suffering from progeroid EDS. Currently, a b4galt7 knockout zebrafish model is being created using the CRISPR/Cas technology.",2016

We present detailed phenotype of an 18 years old male patient with mEDS type II. Clinical findings: The patient was the second child of consanguineous parents of Turkish descent. In infancy he presented with hypertelorism, lar ge anterior fontanel, flattened occiput, low hair line and wide neck, bilateral adducted thumbs and arachnodactyly. He had umbilical hernia, diastasis recti, constipation, bilateral hydronephrosis, as well as cryptorchidism. He had delayed psychomotor development. MRI of cerebrum showed a corti cal heterotopia of 5 12 mm, interpreted as neuronal migration defect. He had myopia, strabismus and mild unilateral perceptive hearing loss. He was diagnosed with scoliosis, joint hypermobility, repeated shoulder luxations, and had surgery for pes cavus. The skin was hyperextensible with delayed wound healing, easy bruising and development of large hematomas. Results: No mutations were found in the CHST14 gene.

We present an 8 year old girl with FKBP14 related EDS and COX negative fibers in muscle biopsy. She was born prematurely with microcephaly, hip dysplasia, valgus deformity of feet, severe muscular hypotonia and muscle atrophy. During the first months of life excessive sweating and hyperlactaci demia was noted. Motor milestones were delayed. Acyl carnitine profile in serum and transferrin electrophoresis were normal. EMG showed a myo pathic pattern which prompted us to muscle biopsy. Histopathology and EM showed no structural abnormalities. However, COX staining was nega tive and activity of respiratory chain complexes II+III was reduced. Thus, a mitochondrial disorder was suspected and selected mitochondrial genes (SURF1, SCO2 and MTATP6) were screened but no mutation was found. Du ring infancy motor function improved, but joint hypermobility was noted and she developed hearing impairment, easy bruising, chest deformity and scoliosis starting at the age of 7 years. Based on these findings FKBP14 deficient EDS was suspected and confirmed by sequence analysis which revealed the recurrent homozygous c.362dupC mutation in FKBP14 gene. In conclusion, muscle biopsies in FKBP14 related EDS may sometimes yield unusual findings such as mitochondrial dysfunction which probably is a secondary finding.

Conclusion: This panel provides a powerful tool for the molecular diagno sis in EDS and will help for the characterization and best knowledge of the different EDS types, but also the genetic counseling and the management of patients.",2016
25297,"Introduction: We report two young male patients with the clinical diagnosis of Ehlers Danlos syndrome type VIII (MIM130080), which entity is a very rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by periodontal disease at young age and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum like skin alterations. Ad ditional features like marfanoid habitus, joint hypermobility, osteoarthritis and vascular manifestations were described in literature. The striking sym ptom of chronic leg ulcer was also noted in one or two cases. Neither the pathomechanism nor the underlying gene has been determined so far. Case Report: We performed detailed clinical phenotype analysis of our pati ents, who are brothers, taking into account that less than hundred patients were published until now and plenty of questions are unanswered yet. Both of our patients were attending at dermatological examination because of chronic leg ulcer to be formed on the basis of brownish plaques over the ti bia. Obvious causes in the background like diabetes, arterial and venous cir culation problems were excluded. Karyotype was normal. Anamnesis unra veled almost complete loss of teeth caused by periodontitis in both of them. Discussion: Our poster contains beside the presentation of anamnestic data, physical examination and basic laboratory studies the results of the histolo gical, endocrinological, radiological and immunological work up. Conclusion: We confirm that chronic leg ulcer can be an important sign leading to the diagnosis of Ehlers Danlos syndrome type VIII as it was pro posed in a previous publication by Ronceray et al. (Case Reports in Derma tological Medicine, 2013).",2016
25298,"Ellis van Creveld (EVC) syndrome is characterized by short ribs, shortened tubular bones, trident aspect of the acetabular roof, post axial polydactyly, congenital cardiac defects, dysplastic nails and teeth and labio gingival ad hesions. EVC is caused by mutations in EVC or EVC2. More recently, mutati ons in DYNC2LI1 or WDR35 have been reported in a few cases. Here, we report the molecular screening of 26 EVC family (31 cases, 17 fe tuses and 14 postnatal cases) by targeted NGS (called ciliome), associated with MLPA and array CGH technology. By Ciliome analysis, we identified variants in 20/26 families (10 nonsense, 5 splice site, 1 missense, 5 deletions) in EVC (10), EVC2 (9), EVC/EVC2 (2) and DYNC2LI1 (1). In 18 cases, the absence of any variant (6/18) and the identification of i) an heterozygous variant only (5/18), ii) an Ã¢ÂÂhomozygousÃ¢ÂÂ variant confirmed only at the heterozygous state in the father (3/18), iii) deletions identified by ciliome (4/18) prompted us to perform MLPA and CGH at EVC/EVC2 loci. We identified in 6 families the same deletion of 48Kb encompassing exon 3 to 11 of EVC always inherited from the mother. Finally, in 4/26 families only one heterozygous variant was detected and in 6/26 fa milies, neither variant nor deletion were detected in EVC/EVC2, supporting the involvement of another disease gene. Exome sequencing is in progress. By combining ciliome analysis, MLPA and array CGH, we conclude that EVC and EVC2 account for 73 % of EVC families. Our study emphasizes the high frequency of an EVC deletion of maternal origin.",2016
25299,"OBJECTIVES: Skeletal dysplasias (SD) are responsible for variable types of short statures, deformations and pain, leading to severe disabilities. Since ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 104Back to index 2007, all patients seen for expertise in the french Centre of Reference (CR) for skeletal dysplasia, are systematically recorded in CEMARA, database de dicated to rare diseases. The study objective is to characterize the epidemiological data about SD in France, to better assess care services needs. METHODS: The CEMARA system records for each patient a common data set, sharing its ontology accorded to the Nosology and Classification of Con stitutional Skeletal Dysplasias. CEMARA cases were reviewed for the period 2007 20015. A ÃÂ« case ÃÂ» was defined according to the status of the diagnosis assertion: confirmed, likely, unlikely. The regional prevalences were standardized. RESULTS: On the 31/12/2015, 7.874 patients with SD were identified in CEMARA. The mean of annual new cases was 887. Two third were of ped iatric age. The three main diagnoses were Osteogenesis Imperfecta (1120), achondroplasia (272) and fibrous dysplasia (242). 42% of the diagnosis were confirmed. The age at onset was 14% in antenatal, 28% at birth, and 43% at a later stage. The median transport time to the CR was 33 minutes (30 km). The prevalence of patients with SD at the 31/12/2015 was 18.20 per million (IC 95% [11.59 27.46]) in Paris region. CONCLUSION: This is the first global study about SD at an almost national level.

25300,"Introduction: Epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica is severe often life and health threatening disease affecting sublamina densa of epiderma derma junction of the skin. This disorder is caused exclusively by mutations in CO L7A1 gene resulting in recessive or dominant condition. While nonsense, frameshift and splicing mutation are characteristic for recessive condition, missense mutations particularly glycine substitution can contribute to eit her dominant or recessive condition. Currently, more than 300 disease cau sing variants in COL7A1 are known. Materials and methods: Mutational analysis was carried out in 11 Hungari an patients with phenotype either autosomal recessive and dominant epi dermolysis bullosa dystrofica (DEB) using targeted next generation sequen cing followed by variant analysis. We analysed all exons and their flanking regions of COL7A1 gene. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. DNA library was prepared using transposon based protocol and analysed by massively parallel sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform. Re sulting reads were mapped to human genome hg19 and data were further evaluated using GeneTalk and HGMD database. Results: MPS analysis of 552 genes in patients with assumed recessive type of EB revealed pathogenic homozygotic mutation (c.425A>G, K142R) in 2 patients, which is prevalent in central Europe. In addition, previously unknown compound heterozygote frameshift, nonsense and missense mu tations were found. In dominant EB patients we identified 4 novel missense glycine substitutions and 1 glycine missense mutation previously annotated as pathogenic. Conclusion: Using gene panel approach and massively parallel sequencing we were able to effectively identify novel mutations in epidermolysis bull osa patients.",2016
25301," Farber disease (Farber lipogranulomatosis) represents a broad clinical spectrum presenting from infancy through late childhood, with joint disease (arthritis and/or contractures), subcutaneous nodules and hoarseness as sociated with the pro inflammatory and pro apoptotic characteristics of the lipid ceramide. Farber is caused by mutations in the ASAH1 gene, which lead to acid ceramidase deficiency, accumulation of ceramide, and a distinct va riety of disease phenotypes, culminating in two recognized diseases: Farber disease and Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsy (SMA PME). The prevalence of both diseases is currently unknown and awa reness of them is limited due to their rarity; both are likely underdiagnosed. We have begun collecting data including genotypes, clinical, biochemical and immunologic phenotypes, on a growing cohort of over 30 living Farber patients from around the world. Our findings so far reinforce the validity of the characteristic symptoms of Farber disease (arthritis, nodules, dys phonia). However, it also reveals that there are patients who present with only one or two of these symptoms, and that the spectrum of disease inclu des remarkably attenuated forms with relatively little associated disability. These insights provide an indication for screening of certain pediatric and young adult polyarticular arthritis patients for acid ceramidase deficiency, and such programs are being initiated. Acid ceramidase enzyme therapy is currently under development, and Plexcera Therapeutics is working with physicians and patients to develop a natural history study framework to better understand disease progression and factors influencing the different phenotypes, as well as what benefits can be derived from currently available anti inflammatory treatments.",2016
25302,"Introduction: FOP is rare, severely disabling genetic disorder characterised by heterotopic ossification of muscle and soft tissues. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of FOP in France using data from two national health data collection systems: registry data from CEMARA and me dical/administrative data from PMSI. Materials and Methods: Records in CEMARA and PMSI (for the period 2006 2012) were reviewed for evidence of FOP . Patients who either died before or were born after 01/01/2012 (prevalence date) were excluded. Results: CEMARA 85 patients with FOP were identified in CEMARA. At the prevalence date, 63 had an FOP diagnosis, 10 had experienced symptoms but had not yet received an FOP diagnosis, and the remaining 12 did not have an available diagnosis date. The prevalence was therefore 1.3 cases per million. The mean age was 29, and the age distribution was as follows: 44%<20, 48% 20 60, and 8%>60. PMSI242 patients with the ICD 10 code for FOP were identified in PMSI. The mean age was 42, and the age distribution was as follows: 18%<20, 60% 20 60, and 22%>60. The prevalence of patients with the FOP code was 3.7 cases per million; however, it is unknown whether these patients have a cor responding clinical diagnosis. Conclusion: This study shows a minimum prevalence of 1.3 cases per milli on, higher than previous studies demonstrating 0.36/M (Spain) and 0.61/M (UK). A forthcoming study linking the two data sets will help to refine the accuracy of this estimate.",2016
25303,"Introduction: Frank Ter Haar syndrome (FTHS), also known as Melnicke Needles like syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skeletal, cardio vascular, and eye abnormalities, such as increased intraocu lar pressure, prominent eyes, and hypertelorism. The most common under lying genetic defect in Frank Ter Haar syndrome appears to be a mutation in the SH3PXD2B gene on chromosome 5q35.1. Until now, only six mutations in SH3PXD2B gene has been identified. A genetic heterogeneity of FTHS was suggested in previous studies. Material and Methods: FTHS was suspected clinically in a girl of 2 years old, born from non consanguineous Moroccan healthy parents. The patient had been referred to a medical genetics outpatient clinic for dysmorphic facial features. Whole exome sequencing was performed in the patient and their parents, in addition to Sanger sequencing that was carried out to confirm ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

Trp269Ter (maternal alle le) and c.892delC; p. Asp299ThrfsTer44 (paternal allele) in the SH3PXD2B gene. Sanger sequencing confirmed this mutation in the affected girl and demonstrated that their parents carry this mutation in heterozygous state. Conclusion: Our results confirm the clinical diagnosis of FTHS in this repor ted family and contribute to expand the mutational spectrum of this rare disease. Our study shows also, that exome sequencing is a powerful and a cost effective tool for the diagnosis of a supposed genetically heterogeneous disorder such FTHS.",2016

25305,"Introduction: Giant congenital melanocytic nevi (GCMN) are rare melano cytic benign tumors associated with neurocutaneous melanosis and risk of melanoma and other malignancies. The genetic cause is likely to be the ac quisition of postzygotic alterations. There are evidences of predisposition for GCMN development. We hypothesized that germline variants in mela noma susceptibility genes (MC1R, ATM and MITF) have a role on this pre disposition. Materials and Methods: Analysis of MC1R gene was performed in 21 pati ents by Sanger sequencing. Evaluation of ATM and p. E318 MITF variant was performed in 76.2% (16/21) of them by CoreExome genotype platform (Il lumina). ATM variants were evaluated by ExAC Browser European frequen cy (EB E freq) and functional effect (Polyphen and Shift information).Results:MC1R variants were detected in 57.1% GCMN patients. Statistically signi ficant differences between patients and control population (N,296) in terms of number of alleles or type (Red hair vs non Red hair alleles) were not detected. However, we observed a higher prevalence of patients harbo ring >1 MC1R variant (19%) compare to control population (9.8%). Moreo ver, 18.7% (3/16) GCMN patients carry rare ATM variants: p.

E318K MITF variant was not detected in the set of patients. Conclusions: The study suggests that GCMN patients have a higher incidence of MC1R variants and rare ATM variants. Study of a large number of patients is necessary to confirm such findings. Fundings was provided by FEDASEM, FEDER, Isabel Gemio Research Foun dation and Leo Messi Foundation.",2016
25306,"Hermansky Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is a heterogeneous group of genetic dis orders that typically manifests with oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding diathesis. HPS is associated with defects in Biogenesis of Lysosome related Organelle Complexes (BLOCs), a unique group of proteins that function tog ether in the formation and/or trafficking of endo lysosomal compartments. BLOC 2, for example, consists of three proteins HPS3, HPS5 and HPS6. Here we present a patient with defective BLOC 2 due to a novel mutation in HPS5.Under NHGRI clinical protocol 95 HG 0193, we performed extensive pheno typing in a patient with mild oculocutaneous albinism, easy bruising, absent platelet dense bodies, and no pulmonary fibrosis. Targeted panel sequen cing identified a novel homozygous intronic mutation (NM_181507.1:c.285 10A>G) in HPS5 that predicted to activate a cryptic acceptor splice site. RT PCR analysis showed an insertion of nine nucleotides in the transcript level that predicted to lead to in frame insertion of three amino acids (p. Ser95_Gln96insSerCysSer) in protein level. Gene expression analysis revealed 60 70% reduction of two shorter transcripts of HPS5 and significantly redu ced amounts of HPS5 protein and its interacting partners (HPS3&HPS6). Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy showed accumulation of early endosomes (EEA1) and altered expression and distribution of late (Rab7) and recycling (Rab11) endosomes and lysosomes (CD63) in patient cells compared to control, affirming pathogenicity of the mutation.

25307,"Abdominal hernias are some of the most frequently diagnosed conditions in clinical practice, with more than twenty million hernia repair surgeries per formed annually around the world. While family studies suggest that gene tic factors play an important role in hernia susceptibility, studies assessing specific genetic risk factors have been limited. Because the risks associated with hernias, specifically, bowel incarceration with a substantial risk of mor tality, must be balanced against the risks associated with their treatment, which include chronic pain (6%) and hernia recurrence (10%), there is a clear need for a better understanding of hernia etiology and improved treat ment options. We conducted the first large scale genetic study of hernia risk, identifying noncoding variants at four novel genetic loci underlying the risk of inguinal herniaÃ¢ÂÂthe most common type of hernia. We showed that four genes in these loci (EFEMP1, WT1, EBF2, and ADAMTS6) are expressed in mouse connective tissue. We investigated whether risk SNPs in these loci were associated with other abdominal hernia subtypes, specifically, um bilical, femoral, and ventral hernias. We observed significant associations between the EFEMP1 and WT1 loci and each of these subtypes, including a genome wide significant association between EFEMP1 and ventral hernia ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 106Back to index (p , 7.9*10 10). Pathway analysis suggested that WT1 and EFEMP1 might influence connective tissue maintenance/homeostasis through their action on extracellular matrix enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases that degrade collagen and elastin fibers. This indicates that these loci affect the risk of hernias across anatomical sites and suggests their mechanism of ac tion may underlie hernia susceptibility more generally.",2016

Clinical features ranges from extremely severe pheno type up to moderate adult forms. Modes of Inheritance could be either auto somal dominant or recessive. Material and Methods: Patients were classified according their first clini cal evidence as: i) Intra utero and perinatal: Perinatal HPP . ii) After birth and before 6 months of age: Infantile. iii) Between 6 months to 18 years: Childhood and iv) after 18 years old: adult. Sequencing of ALPL has been performed in 49 index patients and eleven familiars. In silico analysis for those mutations without evidence of HPP has been performed. Results: 37 different mutations have been found in all the 49 patients with HPP . Additionally familial study was positive in the 11 families. Interestingly, we found in 13 patients 11 new mutations that have not been previously related to HPP yet. In silico analysis these 11 mutations have shown a clear pathogenic effect. Cosegregation analysis also supported this idea. Clinical features of these new variants included: 4 adult, 2 childhood, 4 infantile and 3 perinatal HPP .Conclusions: Although ALPL has been widely studied in Hypophosphatasia, our studies highlighted the possibility to find new undescribed mutations that expands the genotype responsible for HPP and adds clinical infor mation correlated to these new variants that is very useful for molecular diagnosis and also to follow up patients with HPP because a new enzyme replacement therapy for HPP has been developed.",2016
25309,"Introduction: Cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED) also known as Sensen brenner syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive heterogeneous ciliopathy primarily characterized by skeletal and ectodermal abnormalities accompa nied with progressive renal failure.

Materials and Methods: We present two cousins with similar phenotype from both consanguineous parents. Whole exome sequencing and analysis was performed by core facility of IGBAM (TUBITAK) using Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 and HomSI (TUBITAK, Turkey) homozygosity mapping analyses program. Results: The boys (at 9 and 5 y.o. when referred) presented similar dysmor phic facial appearance (high prominent forehead, frontal bossing, telecan thus, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, broad nasal bridge, anteverted nares, full cheeks, micrognathy and low set prominent ears). Skeletal findings were short stature, limb shortening, short ribs, narrow chest, brachydactyly. Ectodermal findings were abnormally shaped teeth, dental fusion, hypo/mi crodonty, sparse hair, clinodactyly, abnormal nails and skin and joint laxity. Elder patient had progressive renal failure and transplantation is program med. Both had normal karyotypes: 46,XY. Using WES, we found novel homozygous missense p.

ESHG. ORG 107Back to index resistance. To date, both dominant and recessive transmissions were repor ted but without phenotypic expression in heterozygous carriers in families with recessive mode of inheritance. Methods: We investigated a consanguineous family consisting in two parents and their four children, including the proband, referred for primor dial dwarfism. She had prenatal and postnatal short stature and microce phaly below 4SD for height and OFC, moderate developmental delay, fee ding difficulties, minor facial features, and normal X rays. Two children had normal psychomotor development and height at average range. The fourth child had learning difficulties and height at 2SD. Their mother and fatherÃ¢ÂÂs heights were at 2,5 SD. Based on unusual high IGF1 levels in the proband, we performed IGF1R molecular analysis in this family. Results: An Homozygous missense mutation c.384T>C;p. Phe112Leu was identified in the proband. Both parents and the child having height at 2SD and learning difficulties were heterozygous, whereas both siblings having average height didnÃ¢ÂÂt harbour the mutation. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first family described with pheno typic expression in both heterozygous and homozygous carriers of IGF1R mutation. It seems that each pathogenic allele confers a 2SD height and OFC drop associated with learning difficulties, leading to mild phenotype in he terozygous carriers and severe phenotype evoking primordial dwarfism in homozygote carrier. Since this diagnosis requires special care, it is necessa ry to identify these patients referred for primordial dwarfism by performing IGF1 dosage.",2016

This conditi on has often been considered as a nonspecific manifestation of mosaicism. It has sometimes been mistaken with the pigmentary stage of incontinentia pigmenti. In a few patients, various X chromosome rearrangements have been reported, but the molecular basis of LWNH has remained unknown. We performed deep exome sequencing on skin DNA from a 6 year old pati ent with congenital non progressive linear naevoid hyperpigmentation fol lowing BlaschkoÃ¢ÂÂs lines on his trunk and limbs, without other cutaneous or neurosensory symptoms. We identified a postzygotic heterozygous KITLG c.329A>G (p.

25312,"We observed three siblings from a Moroccan consanguineous family with an early onset chronic and symmetric arthritis diagnosed as rheumatoid fac tor negative polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Genome wide SNP genotyping and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed in affected and unaffected siblings to identify the causative gene defect. Four homozygosity regions in chromosomes 3, 6 (n: 2) and 13 were identi fied as exclusively shared by affected siblings. WES identified three potential candidate variants in these regions: two amino acid substitutions, Pro86Ser in TATDN2 and Asp169Val in FARS2, and a frameshift deletion in the LACC1 gene. Genotyping of 352 healthy Moroccan individuals and bioinformatic analyses supported the frameshift c.128_129delGT variant in the LACC1 gene, leading to a truncated protein (p. Cys43Tyrfs*6), as the most probable causative gene defect in this family. Additional analyses of the LACC1 gene in a group of 23 Spanish sporadic patients with systemic onset JIA revealed no additional pathogenic mutations. Our findings show a homozygous truncating LACC1 mutation as the genetic defect underlying a severe inflammatory joint disease that segregated in a family with a recessive mode of inheritance. These evidences expand the clinical phenotype associated with LACC1 mutations to other forms of JIA than the previously described systemic onset JIA.

After identifying deleterious mutations in a gene encoding the low density lipoprotein recep tor related protein 6 (LRP6) with WES , all its exons were re sequenced with molecular inversion probes, in 67 patients with TA, 1,072 patients with OFC and in 706 controls. Results: We identified a frameshift (c.4594delG, p. Cys1532fs) and a cano nical splice site mutation (c.3398 2A>C, p.?) in LRP6 respectively in the pa tient with TA and OFC, and in the patient with severe TA only. The targeted re sequencing showed significant enrichment of unique LRP6 variants in TA patients, but not in nonsyndromic OFC. From the 5 variants in patients with TA, 2 affect the canonical splice site and 3 were missense variants; all variants segregated with the dominant phenotype and in 1 case the missen se mutation occurred de novo. Additional features in patients with unique LRP6 variants were short stature (4/7), other dental anomalies (5/7) and clinodactyly (3/7). LRP6 acts as a co receptor in the WNT/ ÃÂ² catenin signaling pathway. Our findings further expand the spectrum of LRP6 phenotypes and highlight the role of WNT signaling in dental and orofacial development.

Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) is one of the contributing factors behind low back pain (LBP). Vertebral bone marrow signal changes also known as Modic changes (MC) are a specific phenotype of LDD. MC have heritability of MC is estimated around 30% and strong association with LBP .Materials and Methods: Two Finnish families were studied using whole exo me sequencing and traditional genotyping to identify variants co segrega ting with MC. We focused on rare (MAF < 0.01) and private variants with harmful in silico predictions and variants located in regulatory regions. Results: In Family I an insertion and deletion mutation in the heparan sul fate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) gene, resulting in a premature stop codon, co segregated with MC. The HSPG2 encodes structural protein in mammalian cartilage and basement membranes called perlecan. Mutations in HSPG2 cause rare autosomal recessive disorders with osteochondrodysplasia. Mu tations in HSPG2 have also been associated with idiopathic scoliosis. In the Family II a single nucleotide polymorphism in the MAML1 gene was iden tified in all affected family members. Maml1 knock out mice suffer from impaired chondrocyte maturation. Additionally MAML1 affects the activity of RUNX2 transcription factor.

The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic defect(s) causing this disorder using exome sequencing. Methods: Three patients and two healthy non family members were exome sequenced. Rare variants with harmful prediction that were shared by the patients, but not found from the healthy controls, were validated by Sanger sequencing in four affected and five unaffected family members. The func tional role of the identified variant was studied in vitro. Results: A variant rs41310883 on TUFT1 introducing Thr175Met substi tution was found to co segregate with the disease. The variant was shown to decrease TUFT1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in HEK293 cells. Thr175Met overexpression in ATDC5 cells resulted in increased calci um content and reduced proteoglycans in ECM when compared with over expression of wild type TUFT1 and cells with empty vector. Furthermore, ATDC5 cells overexpressing wild type and mutant TUFT1 displayed reduced expression of marker genes of chondrogenic differentiation and disrupted formation of cartilage nodules during differentiation. Conclusions: We identified a novel susceptibility gene for MTP I OA. Further studies are needed to fully characterize the role of TUFT1 in the pathophy siology of OA.",2016
25317,"Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is a clinically and genetically hetero geneous group of skeletal dysplasias. MED is characterized by pain parti cularly in hips and knee joints. Early onset joint pain usually progress to osteoarthritic degeneration, necessitating total joint arthroplasty. A short stature, waddling gait, and enhanced fatigability are often seen. Mild child hood neuromuscular disorders have previously been reported as a presen tation of MED caused by mutations in COMP .Here, we present a striking case of a 68 year old woman initially diagnosed with myopathy from the age of 50. Throughout life, she exhibited difficul ties in more heavy physical activity due to fatigue, but otherwise she had no joint related symptoms. The pedigree revealed multiple members diagnosed with early onset ar thritis or Legg CalvÃÂ© Perthes disease, as well as several members diagnosed with childhood or adult onset of myopathy. Within the family, numerous analyses had been conducted without final molecular diagnosis. According to the pedigree, an autosomal dominant inheritance was stron gly suspected. Molecular analysis of five MED related genes identified a c.2152C>T mutation in the COMP gene consistent with the diagnosis of au tosomal dominant MED. To our knowledge, this is the first case of COMP related MED with myopathy in adulthood without other MED characteristic joint symptoms. As patients with MED may be wrongly diagnosed with neuromuscular disorders, it is important to be aware of neuromuscular symptoms as a sole symptom in MED in all age groups.",2016

Fifty six molecularly proven cases have been reported in the medical literature to date. Clinical report. The patient was born SGA at term as the only child of healthy Italian parents. Paternal and maternal ages at conception were 39 and 31 years respectively. We evaluated the girl at 14 years. Cardinal history fin dings were delayed motor milestones with normal speech development and a full scale IQ of 74; mild autistic traits; stiffness gradually involving small and large joints and resulting in pronounced functional impairment of the shoulder girdle and tibiotarsal joints in her early teens; GH defici ency; thelarche variant; bilateral chronic otitis media with effusion lea ding to tympanosclerosis; marked retinal vessel tortuosity; astigmatism; laryngospasm during procedural sedation. Congenital heart disease (CHD) requiring surgery (tetralogy of Fallot and peripheral pulmonary stenosis) was identified at 2 weeks of age. Her long standing hepatomegaly, alrea dy present at 6 months, and mild protein losing enteropathy might be pa thogenetically related to perturbed extracellular matrix homoeostasis, as both of them were not significantly modified either by cardiac therapies or, more recently, by constrictive pericarditis.

25319,"Patients with either Myhre or Marfan syndrome may have devastating com plications of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and skeletal systems, but with nearly opposite characteristics. Herein we provide thorough phenotypic information on Myhre patients, including the first detailed report of advan ced pathologic findings in the heart, lung, and other tissues in the less un derstood Myhre syndrome. We provide evidence that an abnormal fibrotic process is occurring in these patients and provide pathologic evidence of the life threatening abnormal wound healing that leads to restrictive disease. Marfan syndrome, caused by pathogenic mutations in FBN1, involves dysre gulation of TGFÃÂ²/SMAD pathways and is characterized by long bone over growth, joint laxity, cystic lung disease and aortic dilation. Myhre syndrome, caused by mutations in one of two codons in SMAD4, is a condition in which patients have short long bones, compact body habitus with tightening of the joints, hearing loss and thickening of tissues. As we describe, this thicke ning includes cardiac and lung tissue, which can cause restrictive disease. Although undoubtedly underdiagnosed in the past, greater awareness of this condition and the availability of clinical whole exome sequencing have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of reported patients with Myhre syndrome. We provide the first reported images and descriptions of Myhre tissue, demonstrating an abnormal healing process, which involves proliferative fibrosis and adhesions. We propose screening protocols for patients with Myhre syndrome and recommend restricting instrumentation and elective procedures for these patients to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.",2016
25320,"Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by enamel defects. To date, mutations in >20 genes have been implicated in either isolated or syndromic AI. We used a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel targeting 585 known or candida te genes in dental disorders to screen a cohort of 61 patients with isolated and syndromic forms of AI. We were able to identify the molecular defect underlying the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ phenotypes in 15 cases (~25%), suggesting that se veral additional genes mutated in AI remain to be discovered. Interestingly, mutations in COL17A1 were the most frequent cause of isolated AI in our cohort, accounting for 8% of patients with isolated AI. Furthermore, NGS based screening of multiple AI genes allowed us to identify a rare case of di genic inheritance in AI, with unlinked heterozygous mutations in COL17A1 and LAMA3 modifying the severity of the phenotype. Finally, sequencing in a seven year old patient presenting with isolated AI revealed the presence of a homozygous missense mutation in CNNM4, mutations in which result in Jalili syndrome, a diagnosis that was subsequently confirmed by ophthal mological investigation. Therefore, we demonstrate that a large proportion of the genetic heterogeneity of AI remains unsolved and that non Mendelian inheritance patterns exist in AI. We also demonstrate that the dental clinic may be a gateway for the diagnosis and management of rare genetic disor ders.

25321," Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a clinically heterogeneous genetic disor der characterized by cafÃÂ© au lait spots, iris Lisch nodules, axillary and ingui nal freckling, and multiple neurofibromas. It is caused by dominant loss of function mutations in the suppressor gene NF1 that encodes for neurofibro min that functions as a negative regulator of RAS activity signalling. In the present study we report clinical and molecular findings of 14 patients (6 unrelated and 7 from 3 families). We screened DNA and RNA isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes from patients that fulfil clinical criteria for NF1. In addition, single and multi exon deletions/duplications screening was performed by MLPA (Kits P81, P82 and P122). The entire NF1 gene co ding region was PCR amplified from total cDNA in several overlapping frag ments, and sequenced afterwards. We identified 9 novel mutations 6 of those were de novo: c.1218_1224delTCACTAT; c.1569delA; c.6752delG; c.3975 ? _8457+?del, r.1722_1748del27 and c.7044G>A (p. Gly23478Stop).

25322,"The previously identified non coding RNA, PRINS, is differentially expressed in psoriatic uninvolved and healthy epidermis. Our in vitro experiments in keratinocytes showed that PRINS expression is altered after exposure to various stressors i. e. UVB, translation inhibition and microbial agents. A re cently described potential stress signal in psoriatic involved skin may be the extracellular DNA, a potent activator of several inflammatory pathways, but its involvement in PRINS signaling was not studied before. The aim of our study was to investigate which pathways are induced in ke ratinocytes by extracellular DNA, and whether PRINS is able to affects the induced inflammatory reactions, thereby its high expression in psoriatic un involved epidermis may contribute to disease pathogenesis. The synthetic DNA analogue poly(dA:dT) induced PRINS expression and the production of psoriasis associated cytokines IL 6, IL 8, IL 12, IL 23 and TNF ÃÂ±. Cytokine production was mediated through NFÃÂºB , STAT3 and MAPK pathways in keratinocytes. To study the role of PRINS in the poly(dA:dT) induced cytokine production we silenced or forced its expres sion by vector based methods. Robust overexpression of PRINS reduced poly(dA:dT) induced IL 6 and IL 8 production on mRNA as well as protein level, but did not affected the production of the other investigated cytokines. In silico analysis revealed an approximately 100 nucleotide long comple mentary region between PRINS and IL 6, suggesting the direct interaction between the two RNA molecules. According to our result we propose that PRINS might act as a regulator of IL 6 production through the interaction with IL 6 mRNA, leading to the degradation of it.

25323,"Introduction: Tooth agenesis is one of the most common developmental anomalies in man. Oligodontia, a severe form of tooth agenesis, occurs both as an isolated anomaly and as a syndromal feature. Materials and Methods: We performed exome sequencing on 20 unrelated individuals with apparent non syndromic oligodontia and failed to detect mutations in genes previously associated with oligodontia. Results: In three of the probands, we detected heterozygous variants in LRP6, and sequencing of additional oligodontia affected individuals yiel ded one additional mutation in LRP6. Three mutations (c.1144_1145dupAG [p. Ala383Glyfs( Ã¢ÂÂ)8], c.1779dupT [p. Glu594( Ã¢ÂÂ)], and c.2224_2225dupTT [p. Leu742Phefs(Ã¢ÂÂ)7]) are predicted to truncate the protein, whereas the fourth (c.56C>T [p. Ala19Val]) is a missense variant of a conserved residue located at the cleavage site of the proteinÃ¢ÂÂs signal peptide. All four affected individuals harboring a LRP6 mutation had a family history of tooth agene sis. LRP6 encodes a transmembrane cell surface protein that functions as a co receptor with members from the Frizzled protein family in the canonical Wnt/ÃÂ² catenin signaling cascade. In this same pathway, WNT10A was re cently identified as a major contributor in the etiology of non syndromic oligodontia. We show that the LRP6 missense variant (c.56C>T) results in altered glycosylation and improper subcellular localization of the protein, resulting in abrogated activation of the Wnt pathway. Conclusions: Our results identify LRP6 variants as contributing to the etio logy of non syndromic autosomal dominant oligodontia and suggest that this gene is a candidate for screening in DNA diagnostics.

25325,"Introduction: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor for the Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), which blocks the in teraction between RANKL and RANK thereby inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Four polymorphisms within the OPG gene, and one polymorphism located 43kB upstream of OPG were analysed in relation to bone mineral density (BMD) and low trauma fractures in Maltese post menopausal women. Methods: A case control collection of 1045 women was used. Cases were women who suffered a fracture, whereas controls had no fracture history. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction followed by re striction fragment length polymorphism or real time PCR. Results: Homozygosity for the A163G minor allele G was associated with lower spine BMD (adjusted OR: 2.6 [95% confidence interval 1.0 7.0]) rela tive to research subjects with a normal BMD. Women carrying two copies of the minor allele for the T950C, G1181C and rs2062377 variants had an in creased fracture risk which was independent of BMD (adjusted OR: 2.7 [1.2 6.5], 2.7 [1.2 6.6], 2.4 [1.1 7.0] respectively). The same variants increased wrist and humerus fracture risk. No association with BMD or fractures was seen for the T245G variant. Haplotype based analysis revealed that the hap lotype block containing all major alleles was protective for fractures (OR: 0.7 [0.5 0.8]), whereas that containing the minor allele for the T950C and G1181C variants increased fracture risk by 3 fold, highlighting the possi bility that the effect of the rs2062377 could be through linkage with these polymorphism. Conclusion: OPG gene polymorphisms predispose to reduced BMD or in creased fracture susceptibility in Maltese postmenopausal women.",2016
25326,"Introduction: Osteoarthritis is one of the most debilitating diseases invol ving degeneration of the articular cartilage of joints and causing disabilities, especially in the elderly population. Genetic and epigenetic factors contribu te to development of primary osteoarthritis. In this study we analyzed the consequences of telomere shortening on cartilage transcriptome in patients with osteoarthritis. The silencing effect of telomeres on genes located near by is known as telomere position effect and the aim of our study was to de termine if telomere shortening causes changes in expression of these genes. Materials and Methods: We analyzed patients with knee osteoarthritis and utilized unaffected and affected cartilage, collected from the same joint of each patient during total joint replacement surgery. We measured relative telomere length in chondrocytes obtained from 50 patients with qPCR. Ad ditionally, analysis of 20 cartilage transcriptomes was completed via RNA Seq on Ion Proton in 10 patients with osteoarthritis. RNA Seq data were analyzed with STAR, Bowtie2, HTSeq and R. Results: Analysis of relative telomere length in 50 patients with osteoarthri tis revealed severe shortening of telomeres in affected cartilage compared to unaffected cartilage. Analysis of cartilage transcriptomes showed significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes from the telomere proximal regions of all chromosomes in the cartilage with telomere shortening. Conclusions: Our results show that telomere shortening affects telomere po sition effect and contributes to osteoarthritis pathology through changes in the cartilage transcriptome of telomere proximal genes.

25328,"Introduction: Type XIV osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a novel form of mo derately severe OI caused by null mutations in TMEM38B . TMEM38B en codes the ER membrane monovalent cation channel, TRIC B, proposed to counterbalance IP 3R mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Howe ver, the molecular mechanisms by which TMEM38B mutations cause OI are unknown. Methods: We identified 3 probands with recessive mutations in TMEM38B and investigated calcium signaling and collagen synthesis in proband fibro blasts and osteoblasts. Results: TRIC B protein is undetectable in proband fibroblasts and osteo blasts, although TMEM38B transcripts are present at 19 86% of control levels. TRIC B deficiency causes impaired release of ER luminal Ca 2+, asso ciated with deficient store operated calcium entry, despite normal stability of SERCA and IP 3R, the channels for ER Ca2+ uptake and release, respectively. Disturbed Ca2+ flux is consistent with ER stress and increased BiP . In the absence of TRIC B, synthesis of type I collagen is dysregulated at multip le steps. Collagen helical lysine hydroxylation is reduced despite increased LH1, and telopeptide hydroxylation is increased despite decreased Ca 2+ de pendent FKBP65. Although PDI levels are maintained, procollagen chain as sembly is delayed in proband cells. The resulting misfolded collagen is sub stantially retained in TRIC B null cells, consistent with a 50 70% reduction in secreted collagen. Lower stability forms of collagen that elude proteoso mal degradation are not incorporated into extracellular matrix, resulting in matrix insufficiency. Conclusions: These data support a role for TRIC B in intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis, and demonstrate that absence of TMEM38B causes OI by dys regulation of multiple Ca2+ regulated collagen specific chaperones and mo difying enzymes in the ER.",2016

Hypothesis free analysis revealed the most significant genes and enriched pathways to be already involved in vascular disease or mineralization, both hallmarks of PXE. This panel will aid in risk stratification and genetic counseling of PXE patients (FWO14/ ASP/084).",2016
25337,"Introduction: Psoriasis is a complex, chronic autoimmune condition with a genetic component. Recent genome wide association studies have identi fied several psoriasis associated loci in intergenic regions whose function is not well understood. Here, bioinformatic and molecular biology techniques were used to identify potentially disease causing variants and their target genes in an intergenic risk locus at 9q31.Materials and methods: The 9q31 locus was characterised using several available datasets in order to (1) identify all SNPs in tight linkage disequi librium with the lead SNP , rs10979182, and (2) search for regulatory fea tures within the SNP set. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chro mosome conformation capture (3C) were used to confirm the presence of regulatory SNPs and identify gene targets, respectively, in a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). Results: 90 SNPs were highly correlated with rs10979182 (r2>0.8) and in tersected three regions clearly displaying marks of enhancers, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, in several cell types according to ENCODE. ChIP confirmed that three SNPs in these regions also bind to these histone marks in Ha CaT cells. Preliminary 3C experiments suggested the presence of long range DNA interactions between intergenic regions and the candidate gene KLF4, but further tests are required to confirm if the psoriasis associated SNPs are involved in these interactions. Conclusions: This work has identified SNPs in the 9q31 locus that have a po tential regulatory function in psoriasis. Further 3C analyses, alongside other functional techniques, must be conducted to identify which genes are likely to be affected by these SNPs.

25338,"Mutations in IL36RN, CARD14 and AP1S3 have been implicated in different pustular psoriatic manifestations, especially in generalized pustular psoria sis (GPP). We recruited 51 GPP patients, 3 patients with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and 4 patients with acrodermatitis con tinua Hallopeau (ACH), and screened them for qualitative and quantitati ve changes in IL36RN, CARD14 and AP1S3 as well as for point mutations in further 4 genes coding for other members of the IL 36 pathway. Within the GPP cohort, we identified 13 homozygous/ compound hetero zygous carriers of mutations (25.5%)) and 3 carriers of a single mutation (5.9%) in IL36RN . Carriers of two mutations had a significantly lower age of onset than non carriers (p<0.01). Concomitant skin/ mucous manifesta tions as well as a continuous course of disease were less often observed in carriers of two IL36RN mutations than in non carriers, while there was no difference in frequency of psoriatic arthritis. Two of the four ACH patients carried one IL36RN mutation. We identified 4 GPP patients that carried he terozygous missense variants in CARD14 predicted/ previously shown to lead to a change in NF ÃÂºB levels. Allele frequency of two AP1S3 mutations was similar in pustular psoriasis (2.6%) and in normal individuals (2.3%). We did not observe any evidence for quantitative changes or point mutati ons in genes coding for other members of the IL 36 pathway in any of the 58 patients. Our analyses point to further genetic overlap between pustular psoriatic manifestations and indicate a specific phenotype in IL36RN caused genera lized pustular psoriasis.

25339,"Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata type 1 (RCDP1) is a peroxisome bio genesis disorder caused by mutations in PEX7 gene encoding a peroxisomal matrix proteins receptor with type 2 peroxisome targeting signal (PTS2). Punctate calcifications in epiphyseal cartilages and coronal clefts of verte bral bodies, cataract, intellectual disability and growth retardation charac terized RCDP1. Most patients die before 10 years for respiratory distress or cardiac malformations. Less than 20% survive 12 years, and single patients beyond 20 years are reported. We describe a 34 year old girl, second child of healthy parents from a small Italian village. Pre and post natal growth restriction, congenital bilateral ca taract, seizures, absence of pituitary gland with GH deficiency and mitral in sufficiency with atrial regurgitation were recorded. At clinical examination she presented with severe intellectual disability, shortening of long bones with prominent proximal involvement, spasticity, keratosis pilaris and sca ling skin. RCDP1 was suspected but skeletal X rays of childhood were not available. Peroxisomal function evaluation revealed reduced red blood cell plasmalo gens, increased plasmatic phytanic acid concentration, and normal levels of very long chain fatty acids. PEX7 molecular testing demonstrated a homo zygous c.653C>T (p. Ala218Val) mutation, a recurrent mutation previously associated to milder RCDP1.We report clinical, biochemical and molecular features of one of the oldest ever reported patients with RCDP1, the first with congenital pituitary hypo plasia and GH deficiency. Interestingly, mutations in PEX7 can also cause an atypical phenotype with longer survival and milder neurologic involvement, normal or near normal growth, and absence of rhizomelia.

Aim: To present a case report and perform a literature search to understand the aetiology of the severe AN, within the syndrome. Method: The child had history and clinical assessment, laboratorz work up (for the aetiology of AN), genetic testing and imaging to evaluate foramen magnum and cranium. Results: A 7 year old boy, known with achondroplasia phenotype from birth, presents with specific dysmorphic features of achondroplasia, severe obe sity (BMI,33.9 kg/m2,>3SD WHO reference), scoliosis in the thoracic and lumbar spine, cervical, axillary and arm folds achantosis niachantosis and linguistic delay, with difficulties adjusting to normal school curriculum. He had normal values of glucose, insulin (HOMA index 0.93), Hb1C and IGF I. Hypothalamic pituitary axis assessment was normal. Other lab work were unremarkable. CT of the neck and cranium revealed slightly reduced fora men magnum and mild hydrocephalus (Evans index,32). The PCR RFLP test showed a heterozygotic G1138A mutation in FGFR3 gene. The clinical, paraclinical workup, genotype and imagistics, suggested the diagnoses of SADDAN syndrome and severe obesity. Diet and lifestyle changes were re commended. The genetic cause for this severe form of achondroplasia in not known. Conclusions: A cause for the severe AN was not established in this case.

Skeletal radiogra phic features include flattening of vertebral bodies, barrel chest and atlan toaxial instability. Mutations have been identified in the DYM gene with an autosomal recessive inheritance. We report two male dizygotic twins first evaluated at 4 years of age with severe short stature ( 4.6SD and 6.9SD, respectively), microcephaly ( 5SD), severe ID. In both siblings radiologic findings enclosed generalized pla tyspondyly with minimal notches and anterior pointing of the vertebral bo dies, rhizomelic limb shortening. Both siblings have cerebral abnormalities (hypoplastic corpus callosum, lateral ventricular dilatation and one sibling presents cerebellar vermian hypoplasia with secondary dilatation of the IV ventricle). Differential diagnosis was discussed among DSME group arguing that cerebral malformations are not typically reported in the DSME. Moreo ver, the typical barrel chest of DMCs was not clinically evident at our first evaluation. We performed WES (Illumina platform HiSeq 2000), on the siblings samp les using an in house implemented pipeline. The analysis identified in both patients a homozygous known mutation in the DYM gene (c.1877delA; p. Lys626AsnfsX720), for which predictive studies suggested loss of function of the relative protein. The variant was confirmed with Sanger sequencing.

Until now, however, large intragenic deletions in this gene have not been described as a cause of TCF12 related craniosyn ostosis. Here, we describe three large intragenic deletions in TCF12 identi fied by whole genome sequencing (WGS).Materials and methods: Within the framework of a broader study on cranio synostosis, WGS of nineteen index cases with coronal synostosis and their family members (forty six samples in total) was carried out by Complete Ge nomics, a BGI Company (Mountain View, CA, USA). The WGS data were ana lyzed using an autosomal dominant disease model. Deletion specific PCR and dideoxy sequence analysis were performed to confirm the WGS results. Results: Using WGS, three large intragenic deletions of 84.949, 8.580 and 5.363 base pairs were identified in TCF12, deleting exons 7 18, 19, and 20, respectively. The first two deletions overlap the exons in which most patho genic point mutations have been described. All index patients had coronal suture synostosis and all deletions were inherited. However, not all parents with the deletions showed clinical signs. Similar non penetrance has pre viously been described in TCF12 related craniosynostosis caused by point mutations. Conclusions: Three large intragenic deletions were identified in TCF12 using WGS, indicating the importance of screening for larger rearrangements in patients suspected for TCF12 related craniosynostosis.",2016
25344,"Aortic aneurysms and dissections are a typical complication of connecti ve tissue disorders such as Marfan and Loeys Dietz syndrome, which are caused by increased TGFB signaling. Since the latter was also found in cancer, the question of increased cancer risk in patients carrying germline mutati ons of TGFB signaling members raised when we recently observed a patient who next to an aortic aneurysm and skeletal signs of Marfan syndrome had colon cancer at the age of 60 years. We therefore performed exome sequen cing with selective analysis of known connective tissue genes and found a potentially disease causing TGFB1 variant c.553C>T/, (p. Arg185Trp/,). Mutations in the TGFB1 gene are known to cause Camurati Engelmann disease, which is characterized by hyperostosis of the long bones and the skull, proximal muscle weakness, severe limb pain, a wide based waddling gait, and joint contractures. Since there is one patient with Camurati En gelmann disease and aortic dissection in his teenage years described in the literature, we assumed that the connective tissue phenotype of our patient was caused by this variant. We considered that his colon cancer might also be related to the TGFB1 variant, but for safety reason extended the exome analysis to known colon cancer genes, which indeed showed in addition a known MLH1 splice site mutation c.2103+1G>T/,. Our observation there fore indicates that despite the link between TGFB signaling and cancer deve lopment, increased cancer risk in patients with germline mutations has not been described so far and may actually be attributable to an independent second disorder.",2016
25345,"Introduction: The aim of the study was to determine genetic defects in the group of patients with a trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS) pheno type derived from the Czech population. Materials and Methods: Each of 9 probands (8 with TRPS I and 1 with TRPS II) was analyzed by use of the 228 B1 MLPA kit (MRC Holland), which covers the relevant 8q24 chromosomal region in order to detect TRPS1 gene and EXT1 gene rearrangements. Additionally, mutational analysis of the coding part of the TRPS1 gene was conducted. Results: In the proband with TRPS II, a large deletion was detected (about 10 Mb), which includes genes TRPS1 and EXT1. In 6 of 8 probands with TRPS I we found some mutations which consider to be the causal ones. It was one large TRPS1 intragene deletion (exons 2 Ã¢ÂÂ 5); two small structural mutations (a deletion in the exon 5, an indel mutation in the exon 4); two nonsense sub stitutions (in the exon 4 and in the exon 5); and one missense substitution (in the exon 6).

25348,"Introduction: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an autosomal dominant dis order characterized mainly by bone fragility and blue sclerae. OI is caused by mutations in type I collagen genes; COL1A1 and COL1A2. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a common disorder for osteogenesis imperfecta patients. More than half of the OI patients have also dentinogenesis imperfecta. Whole Exo me sequencing (WES), involves exome capture, which limits sequencing to the protein coding regions of the genome, composed of about 20,000 genes, 180,000 exons, and constituting approximately 1% of the whole genome. A major indication for use is molecular diagnosis of patients with suspected genetic disorders or of patients with known genetic disorders with substan tial genetic heterogeneity involving substantial gene complexity. Materials and Methods: In this study, we performed WES for a patient pre diagnosed as Ostegenesis Imperfecta. He had also dentinogenesis imperfec ta. Results: The WES results confirmed with Sanger sequencing revealed as a misense mutation at codon 560 of COL1A1 gene: c.1678 G>A (G560S). The mutation was on exon 25 and according to the dbSNP database this mutati on corresponded to rs67507747.Conclusions: It is very important to perform WES after an algorithm. This algorithm has to include, a suspect of a mendelian disorder, multiple genetic conditions in the differential diagnosis, and even if it is available the con ventional diagnosis is prohibitively expensive. Finally, Sanger sequencing in order to confirm the results is also advised.",2016
25349,"Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by decreased bone mine ral density (BMD) and an increased fracture risk. It is determined by envi ronmental and additive genetic susceptibility factors. In a meta analysis by Estrada et al. (2012), 56 loci were found associated with BMD, 14 of which were also associated with osteoporotic fracture. Notably, the list was enri ched for genes of the Wnt pathway. To better understand the role of Wnt pathway genes in determining osteo porosis, we aimed at exploring the allelic architecture of SOST, WNT16 and DKK1 with an emphasis in their coding regions. We resequenced all the exons and intronic flanking regions in two extreme BMD groups from the BARCOS cohort of Spanish postmenopausal women. Selected variants were then genotyped in the full cohort and tested for association to BMD. Initially, 17, 3 and 13 single nucleotide variants were identified in WNT16 , SOST and DKK1, respectively. Seven SNPs showing biased frequencies in the two extreme groups and 6 rare variants located in putative regulato ry elements were genotyped. Significant results were obtained for an in tronic SNP (rs142005327) in WNT16 and for all the missense variants in WNT16 (rs2908004, p. G72R/p. G82R; rs2707466, p. T253I/p. T263I) and SOST (rs17882143, p. V10I). The associated SNPs are in linkage disequilibri um with the respective GWAs hits. A rare variant (rs570754792, SOST) was found in 3 women whose BMD was below the mean of the BARCOS cohort. Our results, suggest that missense variants in SOST and WNT16 are most likely to influence BMD. Funding: 2014SGR 932 (Catalan Government), SAF2014 56562 R (Spanish Government).",2016

In this study the role of common genetic variants in sele noprotein genes (SEPP1 rs3877899, rs7579, SELS rs34713741 TXNRD1 rs35009941, TXNRD2 rs9605031, GPX4 rs713041) and SOD2 gene (rs4880) in the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and aortoiliac oc clusive disease (AOID), as well as their associations with cardiac diseases and function in patients were evaluated. Materials and methods. A series of 516 AAA patients, 352 AIOD patients, and 510 controls were analyzed. Patients were characterized in terms of co ronary and non coronary atherosclerosis and its complications. Genotyping was performed using the TaqMan based assays. Selenoprotein P (SeP) and thioredoxin (Trx) levels in plasma were assessed by ELISA. Results. Higher plasma SeP levels were associated with more favorable car dio metabolic profile in our patients (BMI values, HDLC, TG levels). In AIOD, as compared to AAA, the increased frequency of the GPX4 rs713041TT ho mozygotes was observed: OR,1.66, P,.023 (OR,1.62, P,.046 for AAA wit hout concomitant peripheral atherosclerosis). In patients with systolic heart failure, lower frequency of carriers of the SEPP1 rs3877899G rs7579G ha plotype, and increased levels of studied selenoproteins were found. Higher plasma selenoprotein levels were also associated with presence of small AAA. Conclusions. This study identified variant alleles of the selenoprotein genes as potential genetic markers that indicate predisposition to occlusive and aneurysmal types of arterial disease and to systolic heart failure. Expression of selenoproteins seems to be induced during AAA and heart failure deve lopment, to protect against oxidative stress.

25353,"Introduction: Several studies have suggested C reaction protein (CRP) is associated with the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), but it is unclear whether this association is causal. To avoid confounding or re verse causality, we used Mendelian randomization analysis to study the cau sal role of CRP and diameter of abdominal aorta. Materials and Methods: 465 Chinese participants were included in the analysis. CRP gene rs1205 was used as an instrumental variable of plasma high sensitivity CRP level. We assessed the association of hs CRP levels with diameter of abdominal aorta and other risk factors or confounders in the conventional models, and also assessed the associations of the gene with the diameter of abdominal aorta, hs CRP and other factors. We used two stage least squares for the Mendelian randomization analyses to assess the relati onship between the expected hs CRP level estimated from the gene and the diameter of AAA. Results: In the conventional analysis, hs CRP was associated with AAA (P<0.001, 95% CI 0.03 0.12). rs1205 in CRP gene was associated with hs CRP levels (P<0.0001), but unrelated to other factors, including age, gen der, smoking, drinking and history of hypertension. The results of Mende lian randomization analysis showed a null association of hs CRP with AAA (P,0.71, 95% CI 0.30 0.20). The first stage F statistics was 12.87, indica ting sufficient strength to ensure the validity.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the association of apelin mRNA expression in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues with fasting gluco se, insulin, and insulin resistance among non diabetic subjects. Material & methods: Under a cross sectional analytical design a total of 62 non diabetic subjects, aged Ã¢ÂÂ¥18 years, were eligible for the study. Omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues were obtained during open abdominal surgery. The mRNA expression of apelin in omental and subcutaneous adi pose tissues were assessed by Real Time PCR. Serum levels of apelin, trigly cerides, total cholesterol, glucose, and insulin were measured and homeo static model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA IR), ÃÂ² cell func tion (HOMA B), and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUIK KI) were calculated. Results: Apelin mRNA expression in omental adipose tissue was positively correlated with insulin levels (r,0.281, P,0.034) and HOMA IR (r,0.270, P,0.043) and negatively correlated with QUICKI (r, 0.270, P,0.043).

These conditions have complex genetic pathology, often heterogeneous disorders with overlapping clinical symptoms that are not always penetrant. Classifying variants as pathogenic, as influencing clinical severity or just normal variation is complex.

Patients with inherited arrhyth mia, cardiomyopathy, aortopathy and sudden death conditions are screened with a 101 cardiac gene NGS panel. Gene variants are analysed according to patient phenotype, but the analysis flags variants classified as pathogenic in all genes.

To assess the frequency of rare desmosomal variants in a cohort of apparently healthy athletes in order to evaluate their pathogenic role. Methods. 188 unrelated young athletes (mean age 20 yrs, male/female ratio 3:1), eligible at the pre partecipation clinical evaluation, underwent conven tional genetic screening for major disease causative genes: Desmoglein2 DSG2, Desmoplakin DSP , Plakophilin2 PKP2, Desmocollin2 DSC2, Plakoglo bin JUP . Variants selection was based on the absence or low frequency (mi nor allele frequency <0.0002) of the genetic variants in the general popula tion, aminoacid conservation across species, in silico pathogenic evaluation. Results. Genetic screening identified putative pathogenic rare genetic vari ants in 8 (4.26%) athletes: 3 in DSG2, 2 in DSP and PKP2 respectively and 1 in DSC2. Only one of these variants was also reported in a patient with definite AC criteria. All 8 genotype positive athletes had no family history for AC or SD and showed no clinical signs of the disease at the second level cardiological evaluation. Conclusion. Our study demonstrated the presence of rare genetic desmo somal variants in healthy athletes, questioning their contribution in AC phenotype. The presence of desmosomal variants in the healthy population highlights the importance of clinical evaluation and cascade genetic scree ning in the families of mutation carriers to determine genetic variants pa thogenicity.",2016
25357,"Introduction. Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (AC) is an inherited myocar dial disease characterized by fibro fatty replacement of myocardium, main ly linked to mutations in desmosomal genes. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) enables the analysis of many genes at the same time in a single run. Purpose. We developed a targeted NGS panel for the parallel analysis of 150 genes associated with different cardiomyopathies in the diagnostic setting. Materials and methods. 62 AC patients were analyzed using NGS technology on a Miseq platform (Illumina) using a custom panel of 150 genes associated with cardiomyopathies. The selection of the detected variants was based on the frequency, the conservation rate of the aminoacid, the potential patho genicity and the functional effect on the protein. Results. We identified 92 potentially pathogenic variants in desmosomal genes in 27 patients (43%), 7 of them carried 11 additional non desmoso mal variants, while 26 probands (44%) carried exclusively rare variants in sarcomeric (MYO6, MYH7, MYBPC3, MYH13, TNNI3, TNNT2) and ion chan nel genes (KCNQ3, CACNA1C, SCNN1G, TRPM4, SCN5A, SCN10A, KCNA5, KCNE3, CACNA1B, KCNQ1, KCNK3). Conclusions. The presence of rare likely pathogenic variants in non desmo somal genes in AC probands may exert independent or synergistic effect on pathogenesis of AC. Deeper investigation is necessary to determine the role of these variants on the onset of the clinical phenotype. Cascade genetic screening remains imperative to clarify their role in AC families and to iden tify relatives at risk.",2016
25358,"Inherited cardiomyopathies are caused by mutations in different genes, which makes genetic screening particularly challenging. Targeted next ge neration sequencing (NGS) enables mutation detection in large cohorts of patients affected with genetically heterogeneous diseases. Purpose: developing and validating a targeted NGS system for the genetic diagnosis of inherited cardiomyopathies. Methods: Mutation screening was performed in 19 probands affected with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), 2 with hypertrophic cardiomyo pathy, and 1 with dilated cardiomyopathy, using a NGS gene panel compri sing the exons and adjacent boundaries of 56 genes involved in the main inherited cardiomyopathies. Target capture was performed by HaloPlex kit (Agilent) and samples were sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) at BMR Genomics (Padua). Variants were called using GATK Unified Geno typer, GATK Haplotype Caller, FreeBayes and VarScan2 and annotated with Annovar and SNP Shot (BMR Genomics), the latter used also for variant prioritization. Results: We identified 38 variants validated by Sanger sequencing (SS) and 2 expected false positives (unbalanced variants) and we confirmed 25 out of 27 variants previously detected by SS. Coverage >20X was obtained for 91.95% of 1.416.998 analyzed nucleotides and 90.93% of ACM genes. Among ACM patients, 11 carried mutations in ACM genes and 3 genotype negative carried variants in genes associated to other cardiomyopathies. Conclusions: Our approach represents a valuable tool for mutation scree ning in patients affected with inherited cardiomyopathies. Optimization of target capture will further improve the ability of mutation detection.

25359,"Introduction: ARVD/C is a rare hereditary cardiovascular disorder asso ciated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Patients and Methods: Altogether, 31 cases with clinical diagnosis of ARVD/C underwent genetic counseling followed by TruSight One panel se quencing (Illumina, USA). Detected variants, classified according to ACMG.net , were confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing and familial segregation analysis, where possible. Results: Positive family history was present only in 3 cases (10%) with se vere ARVD/C. Likely pathogenic variants were revealed in 22/31 (71%) of patients in known ARVD/C associated genes, mainly PKP2 in 10/31 of all cases (32%). In addition, variants in DSP , DSG, DSC were identified in 2/31 (6% each). Likely pathogenic variants in DES, TMEM43, TGFB3, ANK3, LDB3, JPH2 and SCN5A occurred once (3% each). One compound heterozygote for DSP/JPH2 mutations was revealed. In 9/31 patients (29%) the molecular etiology was not elucidated by our approach. Only 4/9 patients did not have a detectable DNA variant, in 5/9 patients variants in genes associated with other type of hereditary cardiovascular disease were observed (e.g. KCNE3/ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 119Back to index TRPM4, SCN10A/TRDN, TRPM2, SOS1, FBN1). Conclusion: We carried out a pilot study of ARVD/C variant distribution by an extended next generation sequencing panel in a representative cohort of Czech patients with a predominantly severe ARVD/C. Majority of likely pa thogenic variants were found in PKP2 and the significance of DNA variants in other Ã¢ÂÂnon ARVD/C relatedÃ¢ÂÂ genes should be further assessed in order to provide clinical guidance and risk assessment in extended families.

25361,"Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X linked recessive disease typically charac terized by dilated cardiomyopathy, predominantly proximal skeletal myo pathy, prepubertal short stature and neutropenia. From biochemical point of view the disease is associated with excess of 3 methylglutaconic acid, hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperammonemia. The disease is caused by mutations in the tafazzin gene (TAZ) which lead to cardiolipin deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction. Male patients have variable clinical findings, while female carriers are usually asymptomatic. The TAZ gene was screened for mutations by Sanger sequencing (using Big Dye terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit) in male and female siblings both with left ventricular noncompaction and hypotonia. Additionally, the brot her presented an intermittentneutropenia and increased urinary levels of 3 methylglutaconic and 3 me thylglutaricacid. The molecular genetic testing of the TAZ gene revealed a novel muta tion c.253insC, p.(Arg85Profs*54) in exon 3 of the TAZ gene. Both siblings carry the same mutation. The mutation was inherited from asymptomatic mother. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of Barth syndrome phe notypically manifested in a heterozygous female carrier with normal karyo type. A possible explanation could be non random X inactivation predomi nantly involving the non affected X chromosome.",2016
25362,"Introduction: Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common cardiovascular con genital malformation affecting humans with a prevalence of 0,5 2% in gen eral population. Although it can be diagnosed as an incidental finding, many patients develop life threatening complications that have awoken interest in understanding a molecular basis that remains unknown. Based on 90% heritability and high incidence of familial clustering, our objective was to identify any genetic factor that could predict patients at risk of developing symptomatology. Materials and Methods: Assuming a complex mode of inheritance, we con ducted a transversal exome wide association study in a discovery cohort of 570 cases and 484 Spanish controls that we genotyped with the Axiom Exome Array (Affymetrix) and imputed association results based on the Phase 3 1000 Genomes Project reference panel. We performed association analysis for the total sample and 6 different subgroups classified based on thoracic aortic measurements and valve morphology. The replication series comprised 512 cases and 1,483 European controls that we genotyped with MassArray System (Sequenom). Finally, we performed meta analysis using METAL. Results: We prioritized 13 markers identified during the discovery study for replication along with 5 FBN1 markers previously described as associated, but were not able to replicate any result. Discussion and Conclusions: These negative results support bicuspid aor tic valve complexity (that should not longer be considered a unique entity), the need to establish worldwide collaborations to increase sample size and power and the association of FBN1 with thoracic aortic dilation and not the valvular malformation itself.

NOTCH1 gene is a well proved candidate gene and its mutations have been found both in fami lial and sporadic cases of BAV. Materials and Methods: 66 BAV patients from the GISSI VAR study have been genotyped for the NOTCH1 gene. Results: We identified 64 variants, both in heterozygous and in homozygous state. Fifty two are common polymorphisms present in almost all patients. Eleven variants are new and never reported in literature: two are non synonymous substitution, Gly540Asp in exon 10 and Glu851Gln in exon 16; ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

We selected four statistically relevant and seven new variants identified in six BAV patients and correlated them with clinical and demographic variables as well as imaging and histological parameters. Our preliminary data show that 4 were BAV patients with isolated stenosis in over 60 year old patients. We suppose that these variants correlate with a late necessity to undergo to surgery that is driven by the presence of ste nosis and not by aortic valve regurgitation or ascending aortic aneurysm. Conclusions: We completed the genotyping of 66 BAV patients and found 11 new variants in the NOTCH1 gene never reported in literature. These data confirm that the identification of new clinically relevant biomarkers for BAV requires a deeper genetic understanding of the NOTCH1 gene variants, that could be targeted by future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",2016
25364,"Introduction: The clinical significance of exon level copy number variation (CNV) in inherited cardiovascular conditions has not been widely studied to date. Sequence changes make up the vast majority of reported pathogenic variants in genes associated with inherited cardiomyopathies and arrhyth mias. Methods: We considered a sequential series of 287 patients submitted for an arrhythmia panel, 370 for a cardiomyopathy panel, and 36 for both. Germline DNA from blood was tested, and the gene panels were selected by ordering physicians based on each patientÃ¢ÂÂs clinical indication. Sequence and CNV analysis was performed by validated Next Generation sequencing (NGS) methods, and identified CNVs were confirmed by microarray analysis. Results: Six single or multi exon deletions were identified in patient samp les: two deletions in MYBPC3 in two unrelated patients presenting with hy pertrophic cardiomyopathy; two RYR2 deletions in two unrelated patients presenting with arrhythmia; a PKP2 deletion in a patient presenting with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy; and a CTNNA3 deletion in a patient pre senting with cardiomyopathy. Except CTNNA3, all deletions were classified as pathogenic, and no other pathogenic variants were identified in these individuals. Conclusions: Historically, CNV analysis for these genes was either not widely available clinically or was available as a reflex test. In this case series, CNVs accounted for about 4% of the positive findings, suggesting that CNV analy sis may be an important component of genetic testing for inherited cardio myopathies and arrhythmias in the future.",2016
25365,"Introduction: The ESC guidelines recommend genetic testing merely in pa tients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, a significant subgroup presents with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction without dilatation. Our aim is to compare the yield of NGS gene testing and prognosis in LV dysfunction patients versus DCM patients. Materials and Methods: 262 DCM and 127 LV dysfunction patients under went complete cardiologic evaluation and NGS gene testing of 46 cardio myopathy genes. Genetic or familial predisposition was defined as familial inheritance pattern and/or a (likely) pathogenic mutation. Long term out come used a combined endpoint of life threatening arrhythmia, heart trans plantation, and death. Results: A genetic or familial predisposition was equally distributed bet ween DCM and LV dysfunction patients (100 (38%) vs 57 (45%); P,0.21). A (likely) pathogenic mutation was more frequently found in patients with positive familial inheritance , irrespective of a DCM or LV dysfunction phe notype (20 (25%) vs 17 (9%); P,0.001 and 12 (27%) vs 11 (13%) P,0.049, respectively). After a median follow up of 56 months, long term outcome did not differ between DCM and LV dysfunction. However, in both DCM and LV dysfunction patients outcome was worse in the presence of a genetic/familial predisposition. Conclusion: The diagnostic yield of NGS gene testing is comparable between DCM and LV dysfunction without dilatation. Prognosis is worse in both DCM and LV dysfunction patients with a genetic or familial predisposition. Therefore, genetic screening should also be performed in patients with LV dysfunction.",2016
25366,"Purpose: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and systolic dysfunction. Nowadays 30 50 genes are associated with DCM and a genetic cause of this heterogeneous disorder is found in 30 40% of all patients. The aim of this study was to increase the diagnostic yield of genetic testing by using next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. Methods: In 406 idiopathic DCM patients Sanger sequencing was performed for several genes. A subgroup of 172 patients received one or both of the following gene panel tests: CardioChip (34 genes) and next generation who le exome sequencing using a targeted filter (45 genes). In the gene panel subgroup, TTN was tested in 93 patients. Genetic variants were defined as variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS), likely pathogenic (LP) and pathogenic (P) variants. Results: Sanger sequencing of several genes detected a genetic variant in 16.5%. Genetic variants were found in 46% by gene panel testing. In the gene panel subgroup of 172 patients, a variant in MYH7, PLN and LMNA was detected in 4.1% . A variant in other genes was found in 40.7% . The highest detection rates of likely pathogenic variants or pathogenic variants were found in TTN (13%), RBM20 (3.2%) and MYH7 (2.5%).Conclusions: Our data illustrate that gene panel testing in DCM patients increases the diagno stic yield, with the highest diagnostic yield in TTN . We suggest that genetic analysis in idiopathic DCM patients starts with NGS gene panel testing wit hout prior single gene testing.",2016
25367,"Introduction: According to the WHO, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main cause of death worldwide. CVD involve a large group of heterogeneous disorders that cannot always be precisely diagnosed, so therapy and outco me heavily depend on proper genetic profiling. The aim of this study was to determine genetic variants in patients with CVD. Materials and Methods: DNAs from 11 patients with CVD were analyzed using NGS targeted resequencing of 176 genes included in TruSight Cardio gene panel (Illumina). Variant detection was upon reference human genome (GRCh37).Results: Detected gene variants are as follows: heterozygous ACTA2 :p. Arg258Cys, in a patient with aortic dissection; heterozygous KCNJ2:p. Arg218Trp in a patient with LQTS; double heterozygosity for CACNA1C:p. Arg514Gly and SCN5A :p. Arg800His in a patient with severe hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia; double heterozygosity for ELN:c.890 1G>A and SCN5A : p. Gly9Val in a patient with SVAS, pulmonary valve stenosis and arrhythmia. An interesting finding is the co occurrence of dominant pathogenic variants in different genes, as in the case of two of the patients, which may explain the complexity and severity of the observed phenotypes. In conclusion, detection of common and new variants in the patients with CVD has confirmed or shifted diagnosis, further establishing genetic asso ciation studies involving NGS as analysis of choice for clinical diagnosis and research with large implication on treatment and prognosis of patients and their families.

Recently, the in creased frequency of pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) in congenital heart disease was demonstrated by several different studies. Materials and Methods: We investigate the contribution of CNVs in the pa thogenesis of CHD using molecular methods in 29 cases of stillbirth and new born from ServiÃÂ§o de VerificaÃÂ§ÃÂ£o de ÃÂ³bitos, HC FMUSP . DNA samples from skin and heart tissues were evaluated using AmpFÃ¢ÂÂSTRÃÂ® MiniFilerÃ¢ÂÂ¢ PCR Amplification Kit (Life TechnologiesÃ¢ÂÂ¢, California, USA) and Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) with different kits (MCR Holland, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Results: The results showing several different CNVs such as ZNF74, NCAM2, NFATC1 and AR genes associate with cardiac phenotype. In 9 of 28 stillbirth and new born (32%) with CHD and additional structural abnormalities, we identified cases of Edwards Syndrome, Patau Syndrome, Down Syndrome and one case of Phelan McDermid Syndrome with duplication of ZNF74. Also we identified one case of Turner Syndrome and one case of Turner Syn drome with Y chromosome mosaicism. Only one isolated CHD case did not showed pathogenic CNVs. Conclusion: Molecular autopsy showed efficiency for identifying pathogenic CNVs associated with CHD and also allowed the adequate genetic counse ling.

25371,"Introduction: Heterozygous missense mutations in RYR2 are associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. We identified a novel nonsense mutation p.(Arg4790*) in RYR2 in a young woman follo wing resuscitation from a cardiac arrest. We generated human induced plu ripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to characterise this mutation. Methods: We generated hiPSCs from the affected individual and differen tiated these cells into cardiomyocytes (hiPSC CMs). We performed confocal calcium imaging on the hiPSC CMs and undertook analysis to determine the molecular mechanism by which the mutation results in a phenotype. Results: Baseline calcium imaging showed significantly more patient hiPSC CMs displayed calcium transient abnormalities compared to control hiPSC CMs (66.7% vs 28%). 52.6% of patient hiPSC CMs which displayed normal transients at baseline developed transient abnormalities in response to iso proterenol whilst only 19% of control hiPSC CMs developed abnormalities. More patient hiPSC CMs displayed spontaneous calcium transients at lo wer external calcium concentrations suggesting a lower threshold for store overload induced calcium release (SOICR). The application of carvedilol corrected baseline calcium transient abnormalities in 80% of patient hiPSC CMs. Allele specific qPCR showed expression of both RYR2 alleles, sugge sting that the p.(Arg4790*) mutation does not result in haploinsufficiency. Conclusions: The patient hiPSC CMs display an abnormal calcium handling phenotype with increased abnormalities at baseline and after application of isoproterenol, and a reduced threshold for SOICR. The abnormal calcium handling phenotype was rescued by carvedilol indicating a potential thera peutic approach to prevent arrhythmias.

Juvenile deaths were ascribed to this mutation in a previous publication without DNA confirmation. Research Question: Does the RYR2 p. R420W mutation affect survival in a well ascertained autosomal dominant, multiplex (5 generation) three pedi gree population? Study population: All persons born at an a priori 50% risk from three pedi grees segregating the RYR2 p. R420W were ascertained (n,79). Individuals were included if the disease status of Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 50% of their sibship was known (n,66). We excluded 6 juvenile (< 9yrs) deaths (n,60). Affected individuals included mutation positive and/or obligate carriers (OC) and/or SCD under 50 years. Unaffected status was defined as mutation negative. The remain der were unknown (UK).Methods: Genetic and clinical data from all available medical records were collected from family members. Of 60 individuals, 27 (45%) were affected (16 mutation positive, 6 OC and 5 SCD) and 26 (43%) were unaffected. The unaffected and UK groups were combined. Time to death was compared us ing Kaplan Meier time to event analysis and multivariate Cox regression. Results: Affected status was significantly associated with mortality: RR , 4 (95% CI: 1.1 14.5) and affected males died earlier than females RR,7 (95% CI 1.5 34.5).Conclusions: The RYR2 p.

The genetics of cardio myopathies represents one of the most active areas for the research in mole cular genetics. The aim of our study was genetic testing of 29 patients with diagnosed DCM using next generation sequencing technology. All probands underwent clinical examination and genetic analysis. The control group included thirty healthy asymptomatic subjects without cardiovascular di sease or a family history of DCM. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole peripheral blood using the standard extraction kit. Exome libraries were sequenced on a SOLiD 5500xl flowchip in paired end mode (75plus 25bp). Molecular genetic analyses included also 50 different genes implicated in causing DCM. We didnÃÂ´t find any causal mutation in these genes in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, we found missense muta tions in other genes: SCN5A, SLC9A5, SLC26A9, SLC8A3 and MEGF8. In six patients with dilated cardiomyopathy was detected a disease causing mu tation rs1805124, T/C in SCN5A gene.

25374,"Introduction: Dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular noncompaction are overlapping, genetically heterogeneous disorders with an average low diagnostic yield. Multigene testing may raise detection rate, while a larger increase in variants of uncertain significance hinders genetic counseling. We report a case of recurrent neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventri cular noncompaction in two consecutive pregnancies from a healthy con sanguineous couple that suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Materials and Methods: The index patient was studied with a custom desi gned CardioMass v2.1 NGS panel including 268 genes associated with car diomyopathies and cardiac rhythm disorders. Capture was based on Roche NimbleGen technology and sequencing was performed on a MiSeq Illumina platform. Family studies confirmed NGS variants by direct sequencing. Results: An apparently de novo mutation in MYH7 in the two siblings dis closed germinal mosaicism in the family. Furthermore, both children, as well as their healthy parents, were carriers of a rare heterozygous variant in HCN4 which was previously described in association with bradycardia tachycardia syndrome and left ventricular noncompaction. Conclusions: These results highlight the usefulness of a NGS approach for genetically heterogeneous disorders. This case further shows the challenge of interpretation and the importance of familial segregation studies in the diagnosis of patients with multiple potentially pathogenic variants.

After application of 18 dyn/cm 2 unidirectional or ÃÂ±3 dyn/cm2 of oscillatory shear stress (0.5 and 6 hours stimulation) we performed chro matin immunoprecipitation of H3K27ac mark for active enhancers. Bioin formatical analysis of the sequenced immunoprecipitated DNA fragments revealed thousands of unique specific shear stress induced peaks corre sponding to activated enhancers which were frequently found in proximity of genes regulated by shear stress. Further investigation of the peaks identi fied binding sites of several transcription factors implicated in shear stress responses and adaptation processes, e.g. SMADs for unidirectional and HIC1 for oscillatory flow. In conclusion, we demonstrate a genome wide analysis of shear stress responsive regulatory elements that control the expression of genes important for shear stress induced physiological and pathological endothelial phenotypes. The data provide a deeper insight into the diseases such as atherosclerosis and might open novel targets for therapy. Funded by CiM Flexible Funds, MÃÂ¼nster, Germany.",2016
25376,"Introduction: Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterised by elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol and early symptoms of coronary heart disease. Estimates suggest <10% of FH patients are diagnosed in most countries. Cascade genetic testing, as recom mended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2008) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (2013), may successfully identify new cases. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the Randox FH Multiplex Arrays for this purpose. This FH array is designed to detect 40 FH causing genetic alterations, accounting for 71% of mutations in Great Britain and Ireland. Materials and methods: Close relatives (N,199) of mutation positive index cases (previous confirmation by DNA sequencing) were selected for genetic testing. Screening was conducted as a blind study to remove bias. Mutatio nal analysis was performed using the FH Multiplex Arrays I & II and the Evi dence Investigator analyser (Randox Laboratories Ltd, Crumlin, UK). Results: A true positive rate of 97.8% (89/91 patients) and a true negative rate of 100% (108/108 patients) demonstrates the sensitivity and specifici ty of the test in detecting 37 of 40 targeted family mutations present on the arrays, suggesting a concordance rate of 99% for the Randox FH Multiplex Arrays for cascade genetic screening. Conclusion: The FH arrays successfully identify the most prevalent mutati ons in the Great Britain and Ireland cascade screening population. This will enable a cost effective method for targeted identification of people affected by FH, permit enhanced FH monitoring/management thus reducing FH as sociated morbidity and mortality.",2016
25377,"Introduction: Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is characterized by el evated low density lipoproteins (LDL c) leading to premature cardiovas cular disease. FH is caused by lost of function variants in LDLR, APOB and gain of function variants in PCSK9. Lost of function PCKS9 variants lead to decreases in LDL c. Herein, we describe a family with a LDLR pathogenic mutation and two rare PCSK9 variants and their phenotype consequence. Patients and Methods: LDLR, APOB, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1 were analysed in a FH family, by NGS and MLPA. Results: A heterozygous known pathogenic LDLR mutation, c.2479G>A was observed in the proband and two offspring (Table). Interestingly, son 3 had normal LDLc levels despite having the LDLR mutation. Two variants in PCSK9:[c.137G>T;c.2023delG]+[c.137G>T] was also detected. PCSK9:c.137G>T is a previously described lost of function variant associated with decreases in LDL c. PCSK9:c.2023delG;p. Val675Leufs*130 is a rare variant in the C terminal, identified in a single individual in ExCA. In silico analyses predict the absence of two conserved Cysteines, critical for the correctly folding of the protein, therefore leading to a lost of function. Table.

25378,"Molecular studies in patients with aortic pathology syndromes such as Mar fan and Loeys Dietz syndromes include NGS of FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 as well as their parents to determine the origin of the mutation. Recent reports have shown that somatic mosaicism in parents of individuals with autosomic monogenic genetic diseases is more common than previously thought. Thus, an important proportion of de novo mutations could be the consequence of low level mosaicism in one of the parents. We analyzed 44 parents of patients considered as de novo mutations in FBN1 (n,42) and TGFBR1 (n,2) in order to detect somatic mosaicism. PCR amplicons for the exons of interest in each case were obtained followed by NexteraXT technology to generate libraries and deep sequencing using Mi seq sequencer. The obtained data were analyzed using a somatic alignment to detect low frequency mosaicisms. In 3 index cases we found low frequency mosaicism in one of their parents (in DNA blood sample and buccal cell swab and urine when available).

25379,"Introduction: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic vascu lar disease leading to stenosis, dissection and aneurysm affecting mainly the renal and cerebrovascular arteries. FMD is often an underdiagnosed cause of hypertension and stroke, has higher prevalence in females (~80%) but its pathophysiology is unclear. Methods and Results: We analyzed ~26K common variants (MAF>0.05) generated by exome chip arrays in 249 FMD patients and 689 controls. We replicated 13 modestly associated loci (P<10 4) in 402 cases and 2,537 controls and confirmed an association between FMD and a variant in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1). Three additional case control cohorts including 512 cases and 669 controls replicated this result (overall OR,1.39; P,7.4ÃÂ10 10; 1,154 cases and 3,895 controls). The top va riant, rs9349379, is intronic to PHACTR1, a risk locus for coronary artery disease, migraine, and cervical artery dissection. The analyses of geometri cal parameters of carotids from 2,500 healthy volunteers indicate higher intima media thickness (P,1.97ÃÂ10 4) and wall to lumen ratio (P,0.002) in rs9349379 A carriers, suggesting indices of carotid hypertrophy previous ly described in carotids of FMD patients. Immunohistochemistry detected PHACTR1 in endothelium and smooth muscle cells of FMD and normal human carotids. The expression of PHACTR1 by genotypes in primary hu man fibroblasts showed higher expression in rs9349379 A carriers (N,86, P,0.003). Phactr1 knockdown in zebrafish resulted in dilated vessels indi cating impaired vascular development. Conclusions. We report the first susceptibility locus for FMD and provide evidence for a complex genetic pattern of inheritance and indices of shared pathophysiology between FMD and other cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases.",2016

A number of studies indicated that abnormal metabolism of sulfur amino acids and folates is associated with MS compo nents. Methods and results: We analyzed the role folate deficiency in pathogene ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 125Back to index sis of the metabolic syndrome in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model. The SHRs fed a folate deficient diet showed significantly reduced serum folate (104 ÃÂ± 5 vs. 11 ÃÂ± 1 nmol/L) and urinary folate excretion (4.3 ÃÂ± 0.6 vs. 1.2 ÃÂ± 0.1 nmol/16 h), ectopic fat accumulation, impaired glucose tolerance and increased systolic blood pressure. Next, by using BXH/HXB recombinant inbred strains derived from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and Brown Norway progenitors we detected a deletion variant in the folate receptor 1 (Folr1) promoter resulting in decreased expression of Folr1 mRNA in the kidney. Analysis of the SHR. BN chr.1 congenic strain confirmed that the Folr1 promotor variant in SHR cosegregates with redu ced renal expression of the mRNA and renal folate reabsorption, decreased serum folate levels, ectopic fat accumulation, reduced muscle insulin sen sitivity, and increased blood pressure. Transgenic rescue experiments per formed by expressing a Folr1 transgene in the SHR ameliorated most of the metabolic disturbances. Conclusions: These data support hypothesis that genetic and nutritional fo late deficiency is associated with development of the metabolic syndrome in SHR model and constitutes a previously neglected mechanism that may contribute to increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

25381,"Introduction: Tetralogy of Fallot is one of the most common congenital heart disease (CHD) with an incidence of 7% of CHDs. This disorder consists of four anomalies: ventricular septal defect; over riding aorta; right ventri cular outflow obstruction and right ventricular hypertrophy. Several tran scription factors were identified to be involved in non syndromic Tetralogy of Fallot, notably NKX2 5 and GATA4 . The latter is a zinc finger protein that regulates the down stream target genes, through binding to the specific mo tif (T/A)GATA(A/G), in order to control cell proliferation in the developing heart. The aim of this study was to screen the GATA4 mutations in series of Moroccan patients with Tetralogy of Fallot. Materials and Methods: thirty one patients were recruited in cardio ped iatric department of HASSAN II university hospital Fez. After obtaining consents, we have collected blood samples, and extracted genomic DNA specimens. Then, we carried out PCR and direct sequencing of the GATA4 coding regions for each patient. The obtained sequences were analysed by Bioinformatic alignment tool. Results: we detected two missense mutations and five synonymous mutati ons. These mutations were clustered on exons two and five. In addition to eight polymorphisms spread over the intronic regions, in particular, introns one and four. Considering the non synonymous mutations alone, GATA4 mu tation rate in our cohort reaches 6.5%.Conclusions: given the important role of GATA4 in regulating the heart de velopment process, the identified mutation seems most likely to be respon sible of the observed phenotype in the mutation carriers. Finally, to confirm these results a larger Moroccan TOF cohort will be pertinent.",2016
25382," Introduction: Heart transplant (HT) is a life saving treatment for patients with end stage heart failure. A low incidence but significant problem in HT is the antibody mediated rejection (AMR). In AMR, there is complement ac tivation which contributes to graft damage. Purpose: The aim of this study is to analyze if genetic variants in genes re lated to complements pathway could be associated with the development of AMR. Methods: Genetic variants in 42 genes related to complement pathway have been analyzed by next generation sequencing (Trusight one sequencing panel Illumina) in 48 HT patients, 24 with and 24 without AMR. Statistical was performed with SNPstats. Results: 287 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 42 genes were ana lyzed in both groups (AMR vs control). Three SNPs (rs1143674, rs7562325 and rs1143676) in ITGA4, which codifies for integrin alpha 4 protein, sho wed significant association with AMR. Haplotype association analysis, com prising these 3 SNPs, showed that there is a significant association between AGT haplotype and AMR (OR (95%),9.33 (2.14 40.58) p,0.0047). Other three SNPS (rs1899450_MBL2, rs1048118_CFP , and rs3774268_MASP1) also showed significant association with AMR (p<0.05).Conclusions: AGT haplotype in ITGA4 gene and rs1899450_MBL2, rs1048118_CFP , and rs3774268_MASP1 could be associated with develop ment of AMR in HT patients.

About 35 40% of FH individuals lack of mutations. Herein we analyse the synony mous variants found in individuals without genetic confirmation of the di sease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individuals with possible/confirmed clinical dia gnosis of FH were remitted to our service for genetic testing. LDLR, APOB, PCSK9 and LDLRPA1 was analysed by Next Generation Sequence (NGS). MLPA was performed to detect large insertion/deletions in LDLR. Synony mous variants with frequency <0.01 were selected for in silico analyses. RESULTS: Rare synonymous variants were found in 12 out of 100 patients. The synonymous LDLR:c.2388C>T;p. Ile759Ile, with allele frequency of 0.00001 in ExCA, is located at the 2 position of the splice donor site within exon 16. In silico analyses using Human Splicing Finder identified a new site in enhancer motifs (ESE) and other splicing motifs predicting an impact in protein expression. Ex SKIP revealed the mutated allele has a higher chance of exon skipping than wild type. ESEfinder predicts the lost of two junction sites to SRF1 in the mutated allele with respect to wild type. These data suggest this variant might affect critical regulatory sequences which could change the primary structure protein. CONCLUSIONS: Rare synonymous variants should be analysed in pati ents without genetic confirmation of FH especially those with any predic ted impact on protein regulation.

The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inherited va riants have been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and play a role in phenotype of HCM. Purpose: To study the role of RAAS polymorphisms and mitochondrial ha plogroups on the HCM clinical expression in a population of patients with HCM and genetic diagnosis. Methods: Study population comprised 156 patients with HCM carrying a causative mutation in a sarcomeric MYBPC3 and MYH7 gene. All individuals underwent cardiac examination. We genotyped six RAAS polymorphisms and six mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPÃÂ´s) which defi ne the most common European haplogroups. Results: On multivariable analysis, CMA polymorphism ( 1903A) carriers showed a phenotype characterised by systolic impairment and left ventricu lar dilatation. The DD ACE was associated with a lower survival free from AF and stroke. Polymorphism T174M, was related to a higher hypertrophy. The mitochondrial haplotype V was associated with a reduced survival free from AF and limiting dyspnoea. Haplotype U was associated to dyspnoea. Carriers of haplotype J had more often systolic impairment. Haplotype HV was as sociated with non sustained ventricular tachycardia and sudden death risk score.

25386,"Introduction: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common autosomal dominant genetic disease associated with sudden death and progressive heart failure. Genetic testing is routinely offered to these patients as a means to improve prognosis through appropriate lifestyle and medical interventi ons. However, because mutations in at least 30 genes have been linked to HCM, conventional diagnosis by Sanger sequencing is laborious and time consuming. Advances in high throughput sequencing technologies have the potential to solve this problem, but they also raise new challenges. The aim of this study was to develop a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach to screen for mutations in patients with this disorder. Methods: The study population comprised 60 unrelated consecutively eva luated patients diagnosed with HCM. A capture library was designed and target regions were sequenced on an Illumina platform.

Prevalence might change according to the ethnicity and affecting mainly male patients in their third to fourth decade of life. They are inhe rited as autosomal dominant traits; but recent studies identified complex thought rare genotypes. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mutations in the disease genes underlying such inherited disorders in 400 patients of Sardinian ancestry. We analysed by means of NGS 148 arrythmogenic genes in a consecutive series of 400 Sardinian patients enrolled at the San Francesco Hospital form years 2014 to 2015. In addition, to identify genes significantly enriched in the Sardinian series, we performed a mutation burden test by using as con trol dataset of continental Italians. We confirmed the genetic heterogeneity of the BrS, LQTS and CPVT but in addition we identified: a) a burden of complex genotypes (compound/doub le heterozygous and triple mutation carriers) with a higher prevalence in Sardinians compared with continental Italians (7.8% vs 3.2%) and b) new potential CPVT/LQTS candidates (such as CACNA1B, CASQ2) thus confir ming the idea of a possible genetic overlap between the different disorders. As expected, the use of NGS in the Sardinian population to assess the con tribution of genetics to such malignant cardiac traits, can further elucidate causal mechanisms and in addition these results identify a burden of com plex genotypes that, in panels derived from more cosmopolitan populations, are missing.",2016

Aortic dilatation or ectopia lentis are key features other findings are aggregated to create the systemic score. A score of 7 or more contributes to a diagnosis of Marfan. The nosology does not help directly to diagnose Loeys Dietz syndrome. 77% of probands attending the Aberdeen Marfan Clinic who fulfil the Ghent 2010 nosology for a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and 74% who fulfil Ghent 1996 have an FBN1 mutation.

Aortic root dilatation and mitral valve prolapse are the most common cardiovascular signs and source of major clinical concern because they can lead to severe complications. Arrhythmias such as atrial flutter and ventricular dysrhythmias have been described in MFS, but currently avai lable knowledge is limited. We report on a 13 year old female who presented with several unexplained episodes of ventricular dysrhythmia/fibrillation; recurrent myocarditis and cardiomyopathy were excluded and an ICD was positioned. Previously, she underwent corrective surgery for inguinal hernia and flat feet. Pre operative ECGs resulted normal. Additional clinical investigations revealed abnormal ECGs, severe aortic root dilatation, mitral valve prolapse, mild pectus cari natum and scoliosis, arachnodactyly and mild craniofacial MFS signs, while ectopia lentis and myopia were excluded. Molecular genetic analysis of FBN1 (HRM and MLPA), TGFBR1/2, SMAD3 and TGFB2 for suspected MFS or Loeys Dietz syndrome resulted negative. Therefore, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed which led to the identification of a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in FBN1 (NM_000138 c.7800C>G p. Tyr2600X), previously described in a subject with Marfan syndrome (UMD FBN1 mutations database ID 207), and absent in genetic databases of general population cohorts (1000 genomes, ExAC databases).To our knowledge, this is the first description of ventricular fibrillation as presenting symptom in a pediatric MFS patient. This case confirms that po tentially life threatening arrhythmias should be considered in MFS. Large multi centre studies are needed to gain information on this issue.",2016
25394,"Aim: AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a signal molecule that phos phorylates and inactivates 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reduc tase, the key enzyme controlling cholesterol biosynthesis. We aimed to test whether AMPK signaling pathway is effective in human macrophages which play crucial role in atherosclerosis. In addition, to identify novel modulators of AMPK pathway while exploring the effect of statins on plasma microRNA (miRNA) profile of individuals without coronary artery disease (CAD). Med hod: We measured the expressions of selected genes involved in AMPK path way in THP 1 macrophages treated with simvastatin to assess dependence of their expression on cholesterol level. The AgilentÃ¢ÂÂs miRNA Microarray analyses were performed to compare plasma miRNA profile of individuals (Ã¢ÂÂ¤30% stenosis) treated with and without statin. MiRDB target prediction tool was utilized to identify miRNA target genes involved in AMPK pathway for differently expressed miRNAs. Expressions of target genes were ana lyzed by using real time PCR. Results: Significantly decreased expression of 5 miRNAs (miR 625 5p, miR 550a 3 5p, miR 550b 2 5p, miR 550a 5p, miR let 7d 5p) were observed in individuals receiving statins compared to non statin group (fold change>1.5, p<0.05). In addition, simvastatin increased the expression of AMPK ÃÂ±1, AMPK ÃÂ±2, AMPK ÃÂ²1, AMPK ÃÂ²2 and SREBF2 in THP 1 macrophages. Using miRDB target prediction tool, we identifed AMPK ÃÂ±1 is a strong candidate (target score,95) for miR 625 5p. Conclusion: Our results suggests that statin may downregulate the expres sion of miR 625 5p and induce AMPKÃÂ±1 expression which in turn may ac tivates cholesterol syntesis pathway. Apoptosis associated miR 625 may be used as a novel biomarker for effectiveness of statins therapy in patients with atherosclerosis.",2016
25395,"A patient support group, communicating with each other through Facebook, requested us to develop research on chromosome 6 anomalies. With the help of this patient support group, we recruited 253 patients with deletions or duplications of chromosome 6. We received detailed clinical information (including array reports) of 101 of these patients. Genotype phenotype comparison revealed a recurrent phenotype in seven patients with an overlapping 6q25.1 deletion. TAB2 was the most likely can didate gene in this region. Their phenotype (mitral valve defect and/or di lating cardiomyopathy (DCM), short stature, hyperlaxity and facial features, resembling Noonan syndrome) was so specific, that it could be matched to two unsolved familial cases without chromosome anomalies, known to our department. Exome sequencing and targeted sequencing of TAB2 was performed and mutations segregating with the phenotype were detected in both families. We concluded that mutations of TAB2 and deletions of chro mosome 6q25.1 including TAB2 are associated with cardiac disease and a Noonan syndrome like phenotype. We show that a Facebook based patient support group was able to participate in research, leading to the recognition of a disease gene and the associated phenotype.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms in the phenotypic dif ferences of HCM caused by MYBPC3 truncated mutation using a zebrafish model. Material and Methods: We performed the functional study of two new founder mutations in MYBPC3 which cause HCM and origin truncated pro teins of different lengths: variant A (p. Pro108Alafs*9, 91%) and variant B (p. R891Afs*160, 17%). We injected MYBPC3 variants A or B mRNA in ze brafish embryos at one cell stage to analyze the cardiac size and function. Results: We created a viable zebrafish model of HCM with expression of the human variants A and B. Pathogenicity was suggested by changes in cardiac chambers. Ventricular size was increased when MYBPC3 variant A mRNA was injected. Similar results were found with variant B vs control; neverthe less the differences were not significant between variant A and B. These pre liminary results could indicate that two variants have a dominant effect over phenotype expression of HCM, in contrast with others authors who suggest haploinsufficiency mechanisms due to a markedly lower protein expression of small truncated transcripts. More studies are needed to complete the cha racterization of this animal model and to explore future therapies.

25397,"Introduction: The effect of Coagulation Factor II G20210A (FIIG20210A) and Factor V Leiden (FVL) combined with cardiovascular risk factors on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) was studied in a Maltese population. Methods: Samples from the Maltese Acute Myocardial Infarction (MAMI) study including 423 cases with first MI and 465 controls were tested for the FVL and FIIG20210A mutations using PCR RFLP with MnlI and HindIII re spectively. Interactions with lifestyle and metabolic risk factors were tested using data from questionnaires and medical history. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated to estimate the risk of MI overall and in subgroups. Results: The estimated risk of MI is 1.6 (95%CI 0.64 3.9) for FVL and 1.5 (95%CI 0.76 2.96) for FIIG20210A. An association between FVL and MI was observed in smokers [OR 5.3 (95%CI 1.3 21.5)] but not in non smokers [OR 0.95 (95%CI 0.24 3.84)]. FIIG20210A was associated with a risk of MI amongst research subjects with at least one metabolic risk factor (diabetes, hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia), [(OR 3.5 (95%CI 1.5 8.4)]. In indi viduals having at least one triggering factor (metabolic and/or smoking), a 4.4 fold (95%CI 1.3 14.8) and 3.6 fold risk (95%CI 1.5 8.6) were observed with FVL and FII20210A respectively. Conclusion: FIIG20210A and FVL increase risk of MI in the presence of cer tain cardiovascular risk factors with which they interact synergistically. This may be the basis of contradictory results in the literature. These findings highlight the importance of prevention and treatment of these risk factors.*These authors contributed equally to the study.",2016
25398,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, known to be one of the leading causes of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Due to the large number of causative genes and high rate of private mutations, mutational screening requires the use of extremely sensitive and specific detection methods. Recent technical advances by introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide new possibilities of dilated cardiomyopathies detection. The aim of our study was evaluation of genetic profile of next generation sequencing results in Slovak patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In the cohort of 19 unrelated patients with clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy (n,19; 12 male, 7 female, age range 29 71 years) H558R mutations (exon 12) in SCN5A gene in heterozygous and homozygous form were detected. Altogether, 105 376 sequence variants were identified, 94% were single nucleotide sequence variants, 6% of se quence variants represented insertions and deletions. Among the 103 non synonymous variants three sequence variants (rs34580776, rs41277370, rs942077) where predicted to be Ã¢ÂÂdamagingÃ¢ÂÂ associated with cardiomyo pathy (SIFT score 0 0.5). NGS analyses revealed also the presence of novel mutation of CANX gene.

25399,"Next generation sequencing, also called massively parallel sequencing (MPS), currently is the fastest growing method in the field of molecular genetics. This new technology enables diagnostics of genetically heteroge neous diseases with a significant phenotypic and genetic overlap. On the basis of precise molecular genetic diagnosis it is possible to clarify the dia gnosis in patients with cardiac disease and especially to identify pre sym ptomatic individuals in the family for purposes of monitoring or treatment. Here we present our diagnostic NGS workflow for the analysis of 46 genes involved in pathogenesis of the inherited cardiomyopathy using TrueSight Enrichment technology (Illumina) and for the 51 genes described in asso ciation with arrhythmia disorders using PED Mast Plus technology (Multi plicom) followed by sequencing on the MiSeq (Illumina). This study com prised group of 130 unrelated patients with DCM, ARVC, ventricular fibril lation and arrhythmias. In this study we reanalysed variants detected in our group of patients with a hindsight of 2 years. Based on different databases (dbSNP , ClinVar etc.) as well as co segregation analysis in pedigrees we revealed that several variant originally classified as pathogenic or potentially pathogenic were false posi tive and are newly classified as variants with unknown clinical significance or benign. We will demonstrate this discrepancy on several selected cases and family pedigrees. Our findings point to the need of periodical reassessment of described va riants because their interpretation is constantly changing. Moreover, tight cooperation, clinical and NGS data sharing between investigators focused on the same diagnostic is extremely important to clarify and interpret detected variants.

Genome wide association approach continu es to reveal association of gene polymorphism with OBS in different popula tion. Such studies have not been reported for ethic Arabs. Materials: In this study, we performed a genome wide association study using the Affymetrix High Density Axiom platform GWAS for OBS incidence in 5,016 Saudis of Arab ancestry (3013 controls, 2003 cases).Results: In the discovery set, we identified four susceptibility SNPs for OBS: the rs564702 (OR,1.31; P,1.85x10 8) residing on the KCNMB2 gene, rs16891982 (OR,1.56; P,4.31x10 8 on the SLC45A2 gene, rs2523946 (OR , 1.30; P,2.72x10 8) on the MICD and rs7180536 (OR,1.29; P,4.82x10 8) on the SQRDL gene that demonstrated genome wide significance levels. Fur thermore, two variants, the rs7551194 (OR,1.36; p,7.22x10 7) on POU3F1 and rs2171693 (OR,1.39; P,1.08x10 7) on the PBX1 gene both located on chr1, were also strongly linked to obesity. Besides, three other variants, rs10810271 (OR,1.38; p,6.02 x 10 6) on the FREM1, rs7135639 (OR,1.25; p,5.19x10 6) on the MED13L and rs7890737 (OR,1.30; p,6.92x10 6) on the GPM6B as well as two protective variants, the rs17118166 (OR,0.71; P,3.80x10 6) on SGCD and rs35488337 (OR,0.74; p,3.88x10 6) on ETS1 gene showed borderline association with disease. These variants retained their associations in the replication set, and several haplotypes were simi larly implicated in the disease.

Various substrates of organic cation transporter 1 are associated with cardiovascular biomarkers. We investigated, whether the Oct1 polymorphism rs2297374 is associated with cardiovascular biomar kers and with the risk of cardiovascular death and if the associations found are influenced by antidiabetic therapy. METHODS: The data from the LURIC study, a prospective cohort study of Caucasian individuals scheduled for coronary angiography, were used. We identified 1208 type 2 diabetics, whereof 72 use metformin and 1135 are not on metformin therapy. Cardiovascular mortality was assessed in non diabetics, type 2 diabetics and metformin and non metformin users with different Oct1 rs2297374 genotypes using Cox proportional hazard models and associations with cardiovascular biomarkers were investigated. RESULTS: Cardiovascular mortality risk was for each minor allele copy HR 0.83 95% CI 0.70, 0.98 in patients with T2DM and HR 0.82 CI 0.69 0.97 in non metformin users. In these 2 patients groups the variants of rs2297374 were significantly associated with HDL and total cholesterol levels. No diffe rences in cardiovascular mortality and no associations with the investigated biomarkers were seen in non diabetics and type 2 diabetics on metformin therapy. CONCLUSION: The minor C allele of rs2297374 in the Oct1 gene is asso ciated with decreased cardiovascular mortality in non metformin users eventually due to its influence on HDL and total cholesterol levels.

25402,"Introduction: There is evidence for favourable effects of diets rich in ome ga 3 fatty acids (FAs) on cardiovascular disease. However, little is known on the genetic contribution to FA levels, since most studies have focused on serum lipid concentrations typically used in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: We undertook common and rare variant genome wide multi phenotype analyses (MPA) of FA levels using nuclear magnetic resonance based measures of FAs and 1000 Genomes imputed data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohorts 1966 (N,4949) and 1986 (N,3055). To avoid multicollinearity issues, we selected four FAs for MPA: omega 3, 6, 7/9 and other polyunsaturated FAs. Expression quantitative locus (eQTL) analysis was performed on the Dutch BIOS consortium RNA seq data (N,2116). Results: The common variant meta analysis detected 10 signals associated with FAs (P<5x10 8), including a novel FA locus at MACROD1 (rs1006207). Variation in the other identified loci PCSK9, GCKR, FADS1, ZNF259 , LIPC , PDXDC1, PBX4, APOE and ADAMTS3 has previously been associated with tri glycerides and cholesterol levels, but not specifically with FAs. FADS1 was also identified in the rare variant MPA. The eQTL analysis indicated eight out of 10 MPA identified signals with significant cis eQTL effects on gene expression levels. The novel MACROD1 variant was a cis eQTL for PRDX5 ex pression, suggesting a role in protection against oxidative stress. Conclusions: With a combination of refined lipid measures, MPA and eQTL analysis we have identified genetic loci and differentially expressed genes involved in FA metabolism, providing novel clues for the complex relation ship between lipids and cardiovascular disease.

25403,"Introduction: Peripheral arterial disease(PAD) is a condition that is caused by narrowing of limb arteries due to atherosclerosis. Femoral, popliteal and tibial arteries are more affected in patients with diabetes mellitus(DM). In this study, we investigated the effects of diabetes mellitus and genetic back ground, solely and together in the pathogenesis of PAD. Materials and Methods: In our study we planned to evaluate the effects of Factor V LEIDEN, Factor V H1299R, Prothrombin G20210A, Factor XIII V34L, B Fibrinogen 455 G>A, PAI 1 4G/5G, HPA1 , MTHFR C677T , MTHFR A1298C, ACE I/D, APO B R3500Q, and APO E polymorphisms using a Vien naLab CVD StripAssay. Patients were placed into four groups: 50 patients with DM and PAD, 50 patients with PAD and without DM, 30 patients with DM and without PAD and 30 controls. Results: In the formation of PAD regardless of the presence of diabetes, MTHFR A1298C and PAI 4G/5G homozygous mutation seems to be deter minant (p<0.05 for both). In the presence of DM, PAI 4G/5G homozygous mutation determined the formation of PAD (p<0.05). In regression analy sis, PAI 1 4G/5G gene homozygous mutation was 17,1 times more risky, (p<0,008) 95% CI(2,113 138,660), MTHFR A1298C homozygous mutation was 316,6 times more risky (p<0.001)95%CI(10,763 9315,342) the possi bility of diabetes mellitus with peripheral artery diseases.

25404,"Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), also known as GordonÃ¢ÂÂs syndro me or familial hyperkalemic hypertension (OMIM 145260), is a rare mono genetic disorder mainly characterized by arterial hypertension and hyper kalemia. So far, 4 genes have been identified to be mutated in PHAII patients, either WNK1, WNK4, KLHL3 or CUL3. All patients can be effectively treated by thiazide diuretics, compatible with over activity of the thiazide sensitive Na+ Cl cotransporter in the kidney. A 60 years old female patient had been diagnosed with hyperkalemia e.c.i. > 10 years. Metabolic acidosis and hypertension were not present. Plasma potassium level was 6.3 mmol/L (normal range 3.5 5.1 mmol/L) as well as a mild hyperchloremia with low plasma levels of aldosterone and low normal plasma levels of renin. Sanger sequencing revealed a novel heterozygote G>A mutation in exon 11 of KLHL3, leading to an amino acid change (V434M). This mutation was adjacent to already known disease causing mutations. Prediction models indicate that this V434M has a deleterious effect on KLHL3 function. No ad ditional mutations were found in WNK1, WNK4, and CUL3. The patient was treated with hydrochlorothiazide, which resulted in normalization of potas sium plasma levels as well as in lowering of her normal blood pressure. Genetic analysis of her two daughters, revealing the same hyperkalemia (6.3 and 5.9 mmol/L, respectively) without hypertension, showed that both car ry the same heterozygote mutation in KLHL3. They were also treated with hydrochlorothiazide. The genetic analysis of KLHL3 in this family revealed that the diagnosis of PHAII is not always the obligatory combination of hyperkalemia plus hy pertension.",2016
25405,"Introduction: Despite the identification of rare causal variation in several genes, most notably BMPR2, a large proportion of cases of heritable (~20%) and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (~80%) still remain unexplained at the molecular level. Methods: As part of the UK 10,000 Genomes BRIDGE project the whole geno mes of 1,250 unrelated individuals diagnosed with idiopathic and heritable PAH are being sequenced and extensively phenotyped. Stringent filtering based on MAF < 1/10,000 in both BRIDGE and ExAC and deleteriousness and conservation scores are used to prioritise pathogenic variants, coupled with phenotypic information. Results: To date, 5844 whole genomes of rare disease patients have been sequenced including 625 PAH cases. 107 PAH subjects (17%) possess clear ly or likely pathogenic mutations in one of the known PAH genes. The ma jority of loss of function and likely pathogenic missense mutations have been identified in BMPR2 (73 PAH cases [12%]). A further 14 subjects had (micro )deletions of 5kb to 3.8Mb affecting either the entire BMPR2 locus or one or more exons within the gene. Additional variants in the promoter and other non coding regions of BMPR2 are undergoing functional investi gation. We also identified individuals with homozygous (n,6) and potential compound heterozygous (n,6) mutations in EIF2AK4 (2%).Conclusions: Of the known PAH genes, BMPR2 mutations are the most com mon. It is likely that non coding variation around known PAH genes, in par ticular BMPR2, will explain further PAH cases. The genetics underlying PAH appear complex and a large sample size is necessary to test for novel rare sequence variation association.",2016
25406,"Aortic aneurysms/dissections are common manifestations in hereditary connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Loeys Dietz syndrome (LDS). Exploration of underlying pathomechanisms has re vealed prominent dysregulation of the transforming growth factor (TGF) ÃÂ² signaling pathway. Most recently, mutations in SMAD2, encoding a key tran scriptional regulator of TGF ÃÂ² signaling, have been shown to cause aortic aneurysmal disease. Here, we expand the phenotypical spectrum associated with SMAD2 mutations in two families presenting with syndromic aorto pathy. The application of a custom targeted resequencing panel, including SMAD2, led to the identification of two novel missense mutations, both affecting highly conserved amino acids in the functionally important DNA binding MH2 domain of SMAD2. The first mutation (p. Asn318Lys) was found in a 63 years old female pro band presenting with an LDS phenotype: facial features (high arched pa late, broad uvula, downslanting palpebral fissures), skeletal abnormalities (arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum and scoliosis surgeries at ages 11 and 36 years), aortic root replacement (age 53 years). Segregation analysis re vealed the presence of the SMAD2 mutation in the daughter who presents with marfanoid features. The second mutation carrier (p. Ser397Tyr) was diagnosed with LDS. Cardiovascular symptoms include aortic root dilatati on and marked tortuosity of the neck vessels, no major skeletal abnormali ties were noted. We confirmed presence of the mutation in a daughter with hypertelorism and arterial tortuosity and mother with hypertelorism and normal echocardiography.

25407,"Introduction: Atherosclerosis is accompanied by increased oxidative stress. MtDNA is exposed to oxidative damage, since it is located near the ROS pro duction sites. To describe possible somatic mtDNA mutations arising during atherogenesis, we have compared heteroplasmic mtDNA variations in the carotid plaques and blood using massive parallel sequencing. Materials and methods: Ten paired samples of DNA extracted from the abla ted carotid plaques and from the blood of the patients, were analyzed. MtD NA was amplified in two overlapped PCR products, sequenced and analyzed on the MiSeq platform, using 1% threshold for variant calling. Single nu cleotide indels were not considered if detected in more than two individuals. Results: The mean base coverage across the mitochondrial genome was about 8000. All individuals had heteroplasmic positions at the minimum 1% level (average 3.2 positions per plaque sample and 3.1 positions per blood sample). Altogether, 50 heteroplasmic positions were revealed, 12 of them were common for the blood and plaque samples, and only 1 position was found to be heteroplasmic in two individuals. The heteroplasmic positions were concentrated in the control region (30%), and in protein coding ge nes (54%). Transition to transversion ratio was elevated (9:1), as well as nonsynonymous mutations (73% of all protein coding heteroplasmies, in cluding 2 frameshifts), comparing to population polymorphisms. Conclusions: There is considerable heteroplasmic mtDNA variation in atherosclerosis, with no significant differences between blood and carotid plaques. The somatic mtDNA variation characteristics differ from those of inherited polymorphisms.

25408,"Introduction: The transforming growth factor ÃÂ² (TGF ÃÂ²) superfamily signa ling plays critical roles in the regulation of cellular growth, differentiation and development. Mutations in the plasma membrane components of the TGF ÃÂ² signaling pathways including mutations in BMPR2, ENDOGLIN and ALK1 genes have been shown to cause pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia types 1 (HHT1) and 2 (HHT2), respectively. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms of the majority of the reported mutations are unknown. Materials and Methods: The C terminally tagged cDNAs of BMPR2, ENDOG LIN and ALK1 in mammalian expression vectors were used as templates to generate the required missense disease causing mutations by QuikChange site directed mutagenesis. The constructs were transfected into HeLa and HEK293 cells and the expressed proteins were analyzed biochemically and by confocal microscopy. Results: Ten of the examined eighteen missense mutants in BMPR2 have shown aberrant subcellular trafficking with the extracellular domain mu tants predominantly retained within the lumen of the ER. Similarly, the ma jority of the analyzed missense mutants in ALK1 and ENDOGLIN exhibited aberrant trafficking and intracellular retention by the ER quality control ma chinery. In addition, we found that the plasma membrane trafficking of these mutants was amenable to correction by chemical chaperones. Conclusions: ER retention of TGF ÃÂ² mutant proteins is a major cellular me chanism underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension and hereditary he morrhagic telangiectasia. Manipulation of this ER retention is a potential target for therapeutic intervention is these diseases.",2016

The aim of this study is to evaluate a target Next Generati on Sequencing (NGS) panel, which includes sarcomeric genes not only en coding thick/intermediate and thin myofilament (TTm) proteins, but also other sarcomeric genes and some causative genes of HCM phenocopy. A Ion AmpliSeqÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Custom Panel for the enrichment of 19 genes, 9 of which not encoding TTm proteins, was established. By using Ion Personal Genome Ma chine, we studied: (i) a training set (n. 73 DNA samples) already genotyped to optimize the NGS strategy; (ii) a discovery set (n. 19 DNA samples). In the training set we identified 71 out of 72 expected mutations and 15 additional mutations, 10 of which in genes not encoding TTm proteins; of them, 4 are identified in MYOM1 gene. In the discovery set we identified 20 mutations: the diagnostic yield was increased of about 20% and, among the mutations not belonging to genes encoding TTm proteins, we identified mutant alle les of MYOZ2 (one), MYOM1 (two) and LAMP2 (one) genes. Our combined targeted NGS Sanger sequencing based strategy allowed: a) the molecular diagnosis of HCM with greater efficiency than using the conventional (San ger) sequencing alone; b) the identification of less frequently mutant alleles associated to HCM like MYOM1 and MYOZ2 genes (Siegert et al., 2011; Osio et al., 2007).

25410,"Affecting 1Ã¢ÂÂ2% of the population, bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart malformation. Although it is usually asymptoma tic, 10Ã¢ÂÂ20% of individuals with BAV develop life threatening thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA). Several studies have indicated that up to 10% of left si ded heart defects are caused by deleterious copy number variations (CNVs). Hence, we hypothesize that CNVs may also contribute to the pathogenesis of BAV/TAA. CNV analysis was performed in 100 unrelated BAV/TAA patients using the CytoSNP12.2 array, followed by data analysis with the CNV WebStore tool. CNVs affecting protein coding genes with a potential role in the cardiovas cular system and with a low frequency in healthy individuals (MAF<0.5%) were manually prioritised for validation with MLPA/qPCR/MAQ. Each BAV/TAA patient carried approximately 14 CNVs, which is comparable to what is observed in healthy individuals. After filtering based on gene con tent, 15 candidates remained, of which six could be validated. These CNVs did not encompass any known BAV/TAA genes and segregation analysis did not support fully penetrant pathogenicity. According to DECIPHER, CNVs overlapping with candidate CNVs were also identified in controls or in high ly dissimilar diseases without cardiovascular involvement, further demon strating the unlikeliness that these CNVs directly cause BAV/TAA. Our results show that this BAV/TAA cohort is not enriched for deleterious CNVs causing BAV/TAA. This finding is in contrast to prior studies of other left sided heart defects, which identified CNVs as a major causative factor. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that certain CNVs contribute as modifiers, creating a sensitised background for BAV/TAA.",2016
25411," Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a debilitating disease that contributes to the manifestation of complex disease, such as coronary heart disease, with a strong genetic component. However the genetic basis for the disease is not fully understood yet. Materials and Method: In the present study, we performed a genome wide association study using the Affymetrix High Density Axiom platform for the disease in the ethnic Saudi Arab population (cases versus).Results: In all, in the discovery study, we identified nine variants that dis played significant (PÃ¢ÂÂ¤10_7) or suggestive (PÃ¢ÂÂ¤10_6) association with the di sease. The lead variant was the rs4506565 [1.29(1.19 1.40); p,8.78E 10] on chr10 in the TCF7L2 gene. Another variant rs16976967 [1.22(1.12 1.33); p,4.17E 06] on chr15 in the MNS1 gene showed suggestive association with disease. On the other hand seven other variants showed weak protective properties against the disease. These included the rs10789192 [0.83[0.76 0.9); p,4.52E 06] on chr1 in the PDE4B gene, rs681828 [0.82(0.76 0.88); p,5.44E 07] on chr1 in the KCNK1 gene, rs13411975 [0.84(0.77 0.92); p,8.76E 06] on chr2 in the SNTG2 gene, rs9824601 [0.82(0.76 0.88); p,1.39E 07] on chr3 in the MRPL3 gene, rs4352831 [0.88(0.82 0.95); p,6.48E 06] on chr8 in the ADCY8 gene, rs150524 [0.82(0.76 0.89); p,1.47E 06] on chr17 in the CCL1 gene and the intergenic rs9948423 [0.7(0.6 0.81); p,2.15E 06] on chr18. Interestingly, we were able to validate the associations of these variant with disease in a separate cohort. Conclusions: The study revealed several variants throughout the genome that conferred risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our validation experiment suggests a strong genetic link to the disease in ethnic Arabs. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 133Back to index",2016
25412,"Introduction: Factor XI (FXI) level is an intermediate phenotype of venous thromboembolism a complex disease with a high heritability (~60%). The Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) performed in the GAIT 1 (Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia) Project revealed significant associa tions between the FXI levels and SNPs in KNG1 and F11 genes. Our aim was to identify the genetic variability of KNG1 and F11 that could explain such association. Materials and Methods: The KNG1 and F11 were completely sequenced (exons, introns and promoters) in 110 unrelated individuals from the GAIT 2 Project using Next generation sequencing (NGS) Illumina MiSeq Platform. Association analyses were performed with FXI levels using the PLINK and SKAT package. Also we identified by data filtering and in silico predictions the putative causal mutations. Results: A total of 762 genetic variants were detected. Several significant nominal associations were identified between common variants and cluste red low frequency variants in KNG1 and F11 with FXI levels. Among these associations, the missense rs710446 was significant after the permutation test. In addition, two putative causal mutations were related with high and low FXI levels. Conclusions: Using NGS we investigated the genetic architecture of the F11 and KNG1 loci. This information contributes to the identification of the Ã¢ÂÂmis sing heritabilityÃ¢ÂÂ of this key intermediate phenotype. Concretely, we identi fied putative rare mutations, common variants and clustered low frequency variants associated with FXI levels that may contribute to the risk of venous thromboembolism.

25413,"Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a rare lipid metabolism disease, where mu tations in causative known genes can only explain a low percentage of cases. This disease is characterized by very low plasma concentrations of trigly cerides and total cholesterol (under 30mg/dl), and undetectable levels of LDL and ApoB. Later in life, ABL is associated with atypical development of retinitis pigmentosa, coagulopathy, column neuropathy and myopathy. We used whole exome sequencing (WES) to study a family with two affec ted children and their asymptomatic parents. Mutations in causative known genes for ABL (MTTP) and for diseases with similar phenotype such as Fa milial Hypobetalipoproteinemia (APOB, PCSK9 and ANGPTL3) have been previously discarded by Sanger sequencing. By examining homozygous and compound heterozygous inherited variants, we found that both children carried mutations in TMC6 and SEC23A genes. Although TMC6 does not show a consistent relationship with lipid metabo lism, recent studies have demonstrated that SEC23A, an essential compo nent of coat protein complex II (COPII) coated vesicles, could be involved in the apoB100 lipoproteins exit from the endoplasmic reticulum to de Golgi apparatus. Besides, SEC23A has been associated with Craniolenticulosutural dysplasia (CLSD), disorder characterized by late closing fontanels among other fea tures. Since both children showed unexplained late closing fontanels, our study strongly indicate that SEC23A could be a new ABL causative gene not previously described. Functional assays are currently being developed for both genes to confirm these results.",2016
25414,"Introduction: Plasma amino acid profile in an adolescent boy with history of early onset developmental delay and autism revealed profoundly elevated levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, valine and isoleuci ne, without an increase in their coressponding branched chain 2 ketoacids. Notably, alloisoleucine was not detected and Maple Syrup Urine Disease was ruled out. The biochemical phenotype suggested a defect in the first step of BCAA catabolism. Results: Targeted Sanger sequencing of BCAT2 gene that encodes mitochon drial BCAA aminotransferase revealed a novel homozygous inframe dele tion (NM_001190; c136_147del; p. His46_Pro49del). Studies conducted on patientÃ¢ÂÂs fibroblasts demonstrated a marked reduction in valine oxidation and somewhat impaired leucine oxidation supporting a deficiency of the BCAT enzyme. Protein structural analysis and additional functional studies are ongoing to elucidate the mechanism linking the mutation and enzyme activity. Conclusion: Till date, there is only one reported case of BCAT2 deficiency in the literature that resulted from two compound missense heterozygous BCAT2 mutations in a 25 year old man with normal development and six year history of headaches with mild memory impairment (Wang et al 2015). Our findings lead to discovery of a novel inborn error of catabolism of BCAAs caused by an inframe BCAT2 deletion resulting in developmental delay and autism. References1. Wang XL et al.

25415,"Mitochondrial diseases are clinically heterogeneous group of disorders af fecting energy production. Due to clinical and genetic complexity it is diffi cult to recognize them in clinical practice. We present two cases which were clarified by targeted NGS panel. Case 1: 14 year old male who was born by Caesarian section due to fetal overgrowth. He has intellectual disability (ID), verbal dyspraxia, mildly decreased muscle tone, bilateral moderate sensorineural hearing loss and seizures. MRI and EEG were normal. We found compound heterozygous mutations in BCS1L gene (c.232A>G, p. Ser78Gly and c.245C>T , p. Ser82Leu; NM_001257342.1). Mutations in BCS1L gene are associated with mitochon drial respiratory chain complex III deficiency which leads to reduced activi ty of electron transport chain and increased production of reactive oxygen species. Case 2: 15 year old female, who was born with microcephaly (occipito frontal circumference 31cm, 3SD). She has dysmorphic features, severe ID, microcephaly, epilepsy and mitral valve prolapse. In infancy lactate and alanine were mildly elevated. CT showed enlargement of lateral ventricle and brain atrophy. Muscle electronmicroscopical investigation was normal. We found a novel de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in PDHA1 gene (c.1014_1017dup, p. Arg340Leufs*13, NM_001173454.1). Mutations in PDHA1 gene are associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex defici ency. This causes malfunction of citric acid cycle and deprives the body of energy. We asked for ID and epilepsy associated genes for case 1, microcephaly and ID associated genes for case 2 from NGS panel. These cases illustrate that NGS is a powerful tool which enables diagnosing patients with non classical phenotypes and thus sometimes provides a new perspective to clinicians.",2016
25416,"Background: HLD C variation is one of the main phenotypes in most non communicable disorders like metabolic syndrome. Genetics and environ mental factors have undeniable effects on level of HDL C; among them can be noted to body mass index (BMI) and FTO gene. The current study wants to examine interaction between BMI and FTO and CETP SNPs and their ef fects on HDL C level changes in metabolic syndrome. Material and methods: 1142 subjects were selected from TCGS (%49 male). 382 well defined MetS used as a case and the others used as control. Nine selected polymorphisms from FTO and CETP genes were genotyped by Te tra ARMS PCR. After adjustment for covariate like age, sex and smoking, the association and interactions between studied alleles and HDL C and meta bolic syndrome in different BMI groups, was tested using plink software and PASW Statistics 18.Results: Among all nine SNPs, in presence of BMI, lower serum HDL C had the strongest association with 3 SNPs: rs3764261 (OR: 0.6281, CI95%; 0.6243 0.632, P,2.31*10 6), rs1800775 (OR: 1.517, CI95%; 1.508 1.526, P,7.15*10 6) and rs1864163 (OR: 1.062, CI95%; 1.018 1.108, P,5.08*10 3). Also other SNPs with other parameters of lipid profile showed signi ficance association. Conclusion: In summary, there are some significance relationships between HDL C level and studied polymorphisms in the presence of BMI in metabolic syndrome subjects. It seems that the effects of FTO variations on HDL C le vel are affected by BMI, and BMI play a important role.",2016
25417," Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that entails defects on proteins of the glycosylation pathways. The majority of them are involved in the N glycosylation pathway of proteins (N CDGs), being PMM2 CDG the most frequent disease. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that some glycosylation disorders occur with greater frequency than current estimates. The aim of our work was to establish the mutational spectrum of CDG patients in the Spanish population, focusing on non PMM2 CDG. 83 suspected CDG patients were selected based on their clinical ground and/or abnormal serum transferrin isoforms. Sanger sequencing and/or enzymatic analysis identified 45 PMM2 CDG patients (54%). The genetic analysis of the remaining 38 suspected non PMM2 CDG was addressed by Sanger sequencing or targeted exome sequencing of 43 CDG genes or whole exome sequencing or TruSightTM One sequencing panel (Illumina). 23 non PMM2 CDG patients were genetically diagnosed (60.5%), finding pathogenic mutations on 15 different CDG genes (ALG1, ALG6, ATP6V0A2, B4GALT1, CCDC115, COG7, DOLK, DPAGT1, DPM1, GFPT1, MPI, PGM1, RFT1, SRD5A3, SSR4). All of them are involved in the synthesis of the oligosaccharide linked to dolichol or its transfer onto the protein ex cept ATP6V0A2, B4GALT1, CCDC115 and COG7 which are involved in the processing of the glycan or Golgi homeostasis. Overall, 28 different muta tions were identified, 14 of them are novel mutations. In conclusion: next generation sequencing has improved the diagnosis of these heterogeneous pathologies but reverse phenotyping of the CDG patients will lead an accu rate molecular diagnosis because without phenotype information, genome analysis would be of limited medical value.

25418,"Cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS) are inborn errors of meta bolism involving defects in endogenous synthesis and transport of creatine resulting from pathogenic mutations in the genes GAMT, GATM and SLC6A8 . CCDS have a broad differential diagnosis; clinical features include intellectu al disability, speech delay and seizures. Although rare, CCDS are thought to be under diagnosed with defects in the creatine transporter, SLC6A8, esti mated to account for 2% of X linked intellectual disability and 1% of males with intellectual disability of unknown aetiology. Here, a targeted CCDS se quencing panel was validated for diagnostic use in the Leeds Genetics La boratory, delivered as an integrated service involving first line biochemical testing. This service has thus far detected a pathogenic SLC6A8 mutation in one child with global developmental delay and a homozygous pathoge nic GAMT mutation in two children with severe speech and language delay, with further familial testing where appropriate. Additionally, Whole Exome Sequencing data were obtained from 1133 trios in the Deciphering Deve lopmental Disorders Study, of which 42% of probands were males with at least one relevant clinical feature and 5% had an X linked variant reported by the DDD Study. No pathogenic variants in SLC6A8 were identified in this cohort, consistent with the predicted rarity of CCDS. Nonetheless, this is the first CCDS genetic diagnostic testing offered in a United Kingdom accredited laboratory, uniquely integrated alongside a biochemistry service. It remains likely that CCDS is significantly under diagnosed and it is therefore anticipa ted that the service validated here will contribute to an increased diagnostic rate in the UK.

Migalastat, an oral pharmacological chaperone, stabilizes amenable mutant forms of ÃÂ± galactosidase A in FD patients, increasing lysosomal activity. ATTRACT is an 18 month, open label study, comprising a randomized comparison stu dy of ERT experienced patients switching to 150 mg QOD migalastat HCl (n,36) or remaining on ERT (n,21) and a 12 month open label extension (OLE) with migalastat. Materials and Methods: In the migalastat group, 31 patients with amenable mutations completed the 18 month period and entered 12 month OLE; 49 with amenable mutations received Ã¢ÂÂ¥1 migalastat dose during the combined 30 months. Results: In patients receiving migalastat for 30 months, the mean (95% CI) annualized rate of change (mL/min/1.73m2) from baseline (cbl) in eGFR/CKD Epi and mGFR/iohexol were Ã¢ÂÂ1.7 (Ã¢ÂÂ2.7, Ã¢ÂÂ0.8) and Ã¢ÂÂ2.7 (Ã¢ÂÂ4.8, Ã¢ÂÂ0.6); rates were comparable to those reported in patients receiving ERT for 18 months. In patients receiving migalastat for 30 months, the mean (95% CI) cbl in LVMi (g/m2) were Ã¢ÂÂ3.8 (Ã¢ÂÂ8.9, 1.3) for all patients and Ã¢ÂÂ10.0 (Ã¢ÂÂ16.6, Ã¢ÂÂ3.3) for those with LVH. For ERT treated patients, previously reported 18 month changes in LVMi were Ã¢ÂÂ2.0 (Ã¢ÂÂ11.0, 7.0) for all patients and +4.5 (Ã¢ÂÂ20.9, 29.9) for patients with LVH. LVMi reduction from baseline to month 30 in patients with baseline LVH treated with migalastat was statistically significant.

Patients diagnosed with this disorder show a potentially fatal phenotype after galactose intake in the first days of life. A galactose restricted diet quickly resolves this acute symptoms. The exact mechanism(s) causing the complications (cognitive impairment and in females ovarian insufficiency) and the time window in which the damage occur remain uncertain. The national newborn screening in our country is limited to PKU and Con genital hypothyroidism, and this is why a fast analysis for urinary biomar kers in patients suspected for genetic metabolic disease is an emergency. We present the biochemical abnormalities, the clinical pictures and evolution in three newborn patients diagnosed with classic galactosemia after the first days of life; concentration of urinary galactose (between 9.890 and 11.897 mmol/molCreatinine) and galactitol (between 4.380 and 9.832 mmol/mol Creatinine) were measured using an Bruker Avance 400 MHz Spectrome ter; the 1H NMR spectrum of urine helped in a fast diagnosis but also in comparing the biochemical peculiarities with clinical pictures in our pati ents.

25421,"Introduction: COQ2 encodes para hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase, that catalyzes the second step of the final reaction sequence of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) biosynthesis. A homozygous mutation in COQ2 was the first molecular defect reported in a family with primary CoQ deficiency in 2006, followed by the identification of other 10 families. Their phenotypes vary widely but genotype phenotype correlations remain to be clarified. The structure of human COQ2 has been inferred by sequentially cloning the 5Ã¢ÂÂ region (amplified from genomic DNA) and the 3Ã¢ÂÂ region obtained from cDNA and the reported human sequence shows 4 in frame ATG initiation codons. Methods: we employed in silico and experimental analyses to characterize the 5Ã¢ÂÂ region of COQ2, to analyze the topology and subcellular localization of Coq2p and set up a yeast model to validate COQ2 mutations. Results: We provided experimental evidence showing that the functional human COQ2 transcript is shorter than what was previously thought and that Coq2 is a mitochondrial protein with the C terminus facing the inter membrane space. We engineered all the known COQ2 missense alleles into the S.cerevisiase orthologue to analyze the respiratory phenotype in the de leted strain. Our model proved to be simple and reproducible and demon strated the hypomorphic nature of all mutations. We also showed that the residual activity (measured by CoQ content in yeast) clearly correlates with patientsÃ¢ÂÂ clinical phenotype. Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that the affected tissues dis play a specific sensitivity to different levels of CoQ10 deficiency.

Patients with type Iq, caused by mutations in the SRD5A3 gene, have oph thalmologic abnormalities, ataxia, intellectual disability, speech delay and hypotonia. We report the first patient with type Iq who was diagnosed by clinical whole exome sequencing. The patient was referred for evaluation of nystagmus noted at 3 months, optic nerve atrophy, hypotonia and global developmental delay. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The patient rolled over at 8 months, sat at 10 months and walked at 24 months. She has no words at 2 years. ERG, brain MRI and EEG are normal. She is an only child, and her parents are first cousins. Whole exome sequencing identified a c.57G>A (p. W19X) variant in SRD5A3, which has thusfar only been described in 5 patients. Our patientÃ¢ÂÂs features are similar to the other individuals described, although she does not have ataxia. Transferrin isoelectric focusing was consistent with a type I profile. Ophthalmologic findings in patients with c.57G>A seem to be restricted to optic nerve atrophy, nystagmus and strabismus. Ataxia is less common, and cerebellar malformation may be absent. Intellectual disability is described as being mild. We review the literature about the Iq subtype, further delineate the clinical phenotype of the c.57A>G mutation, and propose that testing for congeni tal disorders of glycosylation type 1q be considered in any patient with ny stagmus, strabismus or optic nerve atrophy, hypotonia and mild intellectual disability.",2016

A large number of defects related to the disruption of normal pyruvate metabolism and/or mi tochondrial function, with a growing list of mitochondrial diseases caused by different nuclear gene defects, makes the molecular diagnosis a labor intensive work that requires a systematic multidisciplinary approach. Herein, we present data relative to the massive parallel sequencing, using the IlluminaÃÂ® clinical exome TruSightTM One Sequencing panel, of a cohort of 29 patients, all selected for having neonatal/infantile encephalopathy with CLA. The clinically significant deemed variants found were confir med by subsequent Sanger sequencing. In thirteen out of the 29 patients, we yield the molecular diagnosis, with mutations in PDHA1 (3), PDHX (1), PHKA2 (1), ACAD9 (1), TK2 (1), NDUFS4 (1), FOXRED1 (1), GFM1 (1), TSFM (1), PDSS1 (1) and COQ2 (1) genes. In silico predictions supported a patho genic role in each case. Segregation analysis in parentsÃ¢ÂÂ DNA confirmed their carrier condition. The overall rate of positive diagnosis was 45%. In absence of previous diagnostic work up, an impaired real time oxygen consumption rate in cultured intact patientsÃ¢ÂÂ fibroblasts is been used as standard method to evaluate the mitochondrial functionality when samples were available. Underscoring the genetic heterogeneity of congenital lactic acidosis, our findings implicate 11 different genes in 29 patients.

Materials and Methods: Twenty five COPD patients who were current smo kers, 22 smokers and 23 healthy nonsmokers (for only PBLs studies) parti cipated in this study. The 4977 bp deletion was detected using a quantita tive real time PCR. Results: The frequency of the mtDNA4977 was significantly higher in the sputum cells of patients with COPD compared to smokers without COPD (p<0.0001). This difference was not observed in PBLs. Levels of cellular oxidative stress were significantly higher in the sputum cells of subjects with COPD than in the smoker group. However, mtDNA copy number, mito chondrial membrane potential (ÃÂÃÂ¨m) and cellular ATP levels in PBLs and sputum cells were not significantly different between the studied groups. The Pearson analysis revealed no correlations between the accumulation of mtDNA4977, and intracellular ATP content and ÃÂÃÂ¨m values of the spu tum cells, although there was a positive correlation between increased mtD NA4977 and the levels of cellular oxidative stress in COPD patients (r:0.80, p<0.0001).Conclusions: Our studies may suggest that the accumulation of mtDNA4977 in the sputum cells of smokers with COPD does not seem to have an impor tant impact on mitochondrial dysfunction in relation to ATP production and ÃÂÃÂ¨m when compared to those of healthy smokers.",2016
25426,"Introduction: Cystinosis is caused by biallelic mutations of the cystinosin (CTNS) gene, encoding a lysosomal cystine transporter. Intralysosomal cy stine accumulation drives progressive organ dysfunction. In Quebec, about 50% of cystinosis patients harbor the W138X nonsense mutation causing a stop codon in exon 7. Nonsense mutations trigger nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of mutant transcripts and inhibit protein translation. Materials and Methods: Aminoglycosides, such as geneticin (G418), have nonsense suppressor activity, which permits translational read through of premature stop codons. To test the effect of G418 on the W138X mutation, we treated CTNS W138X/W138X human fibroblasts for 24h in culture and exami ned CTNS expression and intracellular cystine levels. Using ZFN technology, we also generated a Ctns nonsense mutant mouse (Y226X) for in vivo stu dies of aminoglycoside like compounds. Results: After 24h treatment with G418, CTNS mRNA transcript levels in CTNS W138X/W138X fibroblasts increased to normal levels. Furthermore, G418 reduced intracellular cystine levels by 60%. These results suggest that G418 reduces NMD of CTNS W138X/W138X transcript and allows production of functio nal CTNS. In addition, we confirmed that CtnsY226X/Y226X mice have decreased levels of Ctns transcript and intracellular cystine accumulation, as well as glucosuria and early swan neck lesions of the proximal tubule by 6 months of age. Conclusions: G418 promotes read through of the CTNS W138X mutation, producing sufficient CTNS protein for cystine efflux from lysosomes. This suggests that nonsense suppressor compounds may offer an effective the rapeutic strategy for cystinosis involving nonsense mutations. Our Ctns Y226X/ Y226X mice provide a pre clinical model for screening next generation non sense suppressor drugs. Fellowship: Cystinosis Research Foundation.",2016

Further, the clinical and anthropometric data revealed that the history of hypertension [p<0.001; OR,13.64 (9.15,20.34)], male gender [p,0.003; OR,1.86 (1.22 2.81)] and BMI [p<0.001; OR,1.31 (1.17 1.46)] were the main risk factors for DR. The se results provide strong evidence of association of variants in these genes with susceptibility to DR.",2016
25429,"Introduction: Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are leading problems of modern civilization. In pathogenesis of both disorders key role is played by obesity. Numerous data implicate obesity with DNA hypermethylation including genes regulating insulin sensitivity, however there are only a few reports concerning promoterÃ¢ÂÂs methylation of insulin pathway genes. The aim of our work was to assess the rate of global and site specific DNA me thylation of main insulin pathway genes in obese insulin resistant patients. Methods: Global and site specific DNA methylation was analyzed in lym phocytes and adipose tissue of insulin resistant subjects and controls using EpiJet DNA Methylation Analysis Kit. Site specific DNA methylation was ana lyzed within promoters of INSR, PIK3R1 and SLC2A4 using Real Time PCR. Results: Strong positive correlation between global DNA methylation and BMI was displayed in both types of investigated tissues. Simultaneously, DNA methylation positively correlated with glucose level and insulin resi stance ratios (HOMA IR, QUICKI) in both tissues. Furthermore, increased promoter methylation of analyzed genes was noticed in visceral adipose tissue of insulin resistant patients comparing to controls. WhatÃ¢ÂÂs more, the promoter methylation rate of INSR and SLC2A4 positively correlated with glucose level and insulin resistance and negatively with gene expression. PromotersÃ¢ÂÂ methylation status of all genes correlated positively with BMI. Conclusions: Obtained results indicate the role of DNA hipermethylation in insulin resistance. Aberrant profile of promoters methylation was shown for numerous genes regulating insulin sensitivity including ADIPOQ, LPL or PPARÃÂ³. Present study showed the association between promoters methyla tion of main insulin pathway genes and insulin resistance.",2016

Mutant proteins in Gaucher and Niemann Pick Typ C1 disease are exposed to the ER associated degrada tion (ERAD). In the present study we intend to investigate on the mole cular process underlying inadvertent pre mature degradation of mutant ÃÂ± galactosidase A enzyme (ÃÂ± gal A, OMIM * 300644) in Fabry disease (OMIM # 301500).We used MALDI TOF mass spectrometry to identify ubiquitinated lysine moieties 130, 240 and 426 of ÃÂ± gal A that would lead to proteasomal targe ting. Substitution of these three lysines reduced ubiquitination of the enzy me. Furthermore, we over expressed mutant ÃÂ± gal A in HEK293H cells and applied inhibitors of cellular ubiquitination and the proteasome, summa rised as Ubiquitin/Proteasome System inhibitors (UPSi) in order to prevent the degradation process. Usage of two UPSi, MG132 and Rosiglitazone, led to an twofold increased enzyme level suggesting a potential clinical relevance for this compound class. In search of intracellular binding partners via im munoprecipitation the direct physical interaction of ÃÂ± gal A to different ER resident chaperones (e.g. Calnexin and BiP/GRP78) was confirmed. Further studies will be performed to identify E3 ubiquitin ligase outfit involved in mutant ÃÂ± gal A ubiquitination and degradation in disease state.",2016
25431,"Introduction: More than 1500 mutations causing FH are known. Their detec tion is classically performed by Sanger sequencing and MLPA of the LDLR. Between 2008 and 2012, we used a microarray (LIPOchipÃÂ®) for detecting the (around 250) most frequent mutations in the Spanish population. Be cause of the high potential mutation heterogeneity, during 2013 we tested the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Roche 454 based SEQPRO LIPO RSÃÂ®.Material and Methods: The SEQPRO LIPO RS kit amplifies 48 amplicons cov ering the coding regions of the LDLR, PCSK9 and LDLRAP1 and 2 regions of APOB. The SEQPRO LIPO RS software automatically generates variants lists that were compared to a Mutation Database to provide pathogenic signifi cance. 160 samples of FH patients from Catalonia were screened with this kit. Results: DNA was obtained from patients diagnosed used the Dutch MedPed criteria. 27 samples were diagnosed as possible FH (values between 3 and 5), 55 as probable FH (values of 6 and 7), 55 as definite FH (values Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 8). No values were indicated for 23 patients. Mutations were found in 66 samples, representing 41% of all samples. Forty five different mutations were found, 32 of them being unique, all in the LDLR gene except one mutation in APOB (p. R3527Q). Most mutations were amino acid changes or lead to null al leles. Carriers of mutations whose pathogenicity was already demonstrated showed a higher Dutch Medped than carriers of variants of unknown signifi cance (9.34 vs 6.44).Conclusion: This NGS based kit was proven adequate for FH mutation detec tion.

25433,"Introduction: Gaucher disease, one of the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by a recessively inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme glucorebrosidase, encoded by the GBA1 gene. We investigated the usefulness of neopterin, as a potential biomarker in Gaucher disease and analysed its evolution in response to enzyme replacement therapy. Materials and methods: We measured plasma neopterin levels in 31 pati ents with non neuronopathic Gaucher disease, before and after the onset of enzyme replacement therapy and compared the results with those of 18 healthy controls. Plasma chitotriosidase activity served as a reference bio marker, against which we evaluated the evolution of neopterin. Results: In treatment naÃÂ¯ve patients, neopterin levels were significantly in creased (mean 11.90ÃÂ±5.82 nM), compared with controls (6.63ÃÂ±5.59 nM), and returned to normal levels (6.92ÃÂ±4.66 nM) after average interval of 3.8 years of macrophage targeted recombinant enzyme substitution. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the diagnostic value of neopterin indi cated a cut off value of 7.613 nM, corresponding to an area under the curve of 0.780 and indicating a good discrimination capacity, with a sensitivity of 0.774 and a specificity of 0.778.Conclusions: Plasma neopterin levels reflect the global accumulation of Gau cher cells and the extent of chronic immune activation in this disorder.

25434,"INTRODUCTION: Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type IX (MIM: 30600) re sults from a deficiency in hepatic phosphorylase kinase (PHK) activity, ac counting for ~1/100000 births. PHK is a decahexameric enzyme composed of four subunits, ÃÂ±, ÃÂ², ÃÂ³ and ÃÂ´ encoded by four different genes: PHKA2, PHKB, PHKG and CALM, respectively. Mutations in PHKA2 (MIM 300798) cause the most common subtype, X linked recessive GSD IXa (75% of all GSD IX). Her ein, we report a patient with clinical symptoms compatible with GSD VI or IX. PATIENT AND METHODS: A four year old patient with hepatomegaly, growth retardation, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperlipidaemia and mild fasting hypoglycaemia with hyperketosis was remitted to our service. PYGL, PHKA1, PHKA2, PHKB and PHKG2 were analyzed by Next Generation Se quencing (NGS). RESULTS: We identified the previously undescribed hemizygous variant PHKA2:exon18: c.1963G>A. In silico analyses showed two possible conse quences: 1st missense variant, p. Glu655Lys, affecting a highly conserved amino acid and predicted to be likely pathogenic; 2nd Splicing variant: Ma xEnt, NNSPLICE, GeneSplicer, SliceSiteFinder like predict that this variant disrupt the ex18 canonical splice donor site, probably resulting in an aber rant protein. The variant was absent in the mother, thus, it is likely to have arisen as Ã¢ÂÂde novoÃ¢ÂÂ event. CONCLUSIONS: NGS helped us to improve GSD clinical diagnosis, allowing the simultaneous analysis of several genes. The novel hemizygous variant PHKA2:c.1963G>A, could explain the GSD IXa phenotype observed in our patient. Functional studies should be performed to determine and confirm the pathogenic mechanism, in order to provide genetic counselling to the family.",2016
25435,"In France, HFE hereditary hemochromatosis counts for 95 % of hereditary iron overload. The homozygosity for the p. Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene leads to hepcidin deficiency, enhanced body iron storage and clinical impact. In Biomnis, the detection of the p. Cys282Tyr allele is based on real time PCR using TaqmanÃÂ® probes. Two compound heterozygous states for the p. Cys282Tyr mutant and either the p. His63Asp or the p. Ser65Cys variant alleles are commonly screened although they are associated with mild iron level increase. In recent years several new mutations in HFE gene have been described: for instance a no vel C282Y/R226G compound heterozygous state has been found displaying the biochemical hemochromatosis phenotype. In the course of our genotyping technique for p. Cys282Tyr allele, we have detected abnormal profiles for two patients. A Sanger sequencing has been performed and two new variants have been identified at the 281 codon. For patient 1, the p. Thr281Lys has been found associated with the p. Cys282Tyr and p. His63Asp at the heterozygous states, and for patient 2, the variant p. Thr281Met turned out to be linked to the p. His63Asp allele at the hete rozygous state. Both new mutations do not affect the normal Cys225S S282Cys disulfide bridge in the HFE protein. However while the p. Thr281Lys allele in patient 1 could show the same specificities as a neutral and hypomorphic variant, the p. Thr281Met allele, related to a marked hemochromatosis phenotype in patient 2, could be consistent with a deleterious character. Further investi gations of that mutant protein will be required.",2016

The mutational spectrum of PAH gene in Southern Italy have been documented elsewhere, but in particular from Campania and Sicily. We sequenced the PAH gene and genotype phenotype correlations and genotype based prediction of BH4 responsiveness in 37 PKU patients from Puglia were done. The mutational spectrum included 30 variants with c.1066 11G>A being the most frequent (12,16%). One new variant, c.870 T>G was found. The genotype phenotype correlation was concordant in 90%. The genotype based prediction to BH4 responsiveness was around 40% in our patients; thus, this information could be useful for the selection of candidates for BH4 therapy. The present study enlarges the molecular epidemiology of PAH mutations, particularly with respect to Southern Italy. Our data reinforce the wide heterogeneity of PAH mutations in PKU patients and moreover, reveal a good correlation, with patients carrying null mutati ons in both alleles showing the highest degree of concordance with the most severe phenotypes as previously reported. Finally, the increasing information obtained in this and other studies will improve the prediction of the evolution of the disease and the diagnostic applicability of mutational analysis.

25437,"Introduction: Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a rare autoso mal codominant disease characterized by < 5th percentile of the age and sex specific levels of LDL cholesterol. Most cases are caused by mutations in the APOB gen and, less frequently, by ANGPTL3 mutations. Some FCHL patients with APOB mutations, but not with ANGPTL3 mutations, present with hepatic steatosis and intestinal lipid malabsortion. The molecular cha racterization of these entities is thus often needed for clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling. Aims: To perform molecular diagnosis of FHBL in 20 suspected cases. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from whole blood samples of 20 probands and subjected to PCR. and Sanger sequencing of exons and flan king exon intron of the APOB gene. Probands without APOB mutation were subjected to ANGPTL3 screening. Results: From the 20 probands with the suspected disorder, 10 of them presented APOB mutations. Of these, 9 were in exons and 1 in a splicing zone. A prematurely stop codon was generated in all these probands thus encoding truncated apoB 100 proteins. Two of the 10 probands without APOB mutations presented mutations in ANGPTL3. One was a 5pb delection (c.363_367delCTCAA) generating a prematurely stop codon that impairs ANGPTL 3 function. Conclusions: APOB gene mutations were found in the half of the analyzed probands while ANGPTL3 gene mutations were found in the 20% of pro bands without APOB gene mutation. The identification of unresolved cases could be improved by studying other genes potentially causing inherited hypolipidemia.",2016
25438,"Hyperphenylalaninemias are genetic diseases prevalently caused by a wide range of mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. In vitro ex pression analysis of mutations offers the opportunity to elucidate the mole cular mechanisms involved, investigating the severity of biochemical phe notype, and how a mutation exerts its deleterious effects on the enzyme. To study the effects of mutations on PAH activity, we used an in vitro ex pression system in combination with liquid chromatography applied with ESI MSMS for the quantification of tyrosine produced from phenylalanine to assess the residual activities of 8 missense variants (Y204C, L212P , L249P , L249F, R270K, R261P , S196Y and T380M) associated with PAH deficiency. The assays showed a decreased activity ranging from 7% to 51% that of the wild type protein, with the exception of Y204C, which revealed no signi ficant impact on enzyme function (94ÃÂ±6%). Three mutations (L249F, S196Y, and T380M) were associated with low intermediate levels of activity (21 51%). Mutations L212P , L249P , R270K, and R261P showed very low resi dual activity (7 17%).Moreover, in western blot analysis, all of the mutant proteins with rather low activity (L212P , R270K, R261P) also presented with reduced amounts of protein. Instead, L249P , S196Y, T380M with low activity showed substan tial amount of protein. In particular, L249P showed a clear contrast between strong reduction of activity (7ÃÂ±0,11) and high protein expression. Results from the experimental modulation of mutant residual activity have major implications, both for our understanding of genotype phenotype cor relations and for the discussion of molecular basis of BH4 responsiveness, useful for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",2016
25439,"Introduction: Next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have allowed to promote a cheaper and faster genetic diagnosis. However, due to the un certainties of NGS, the need of a holistic approach to inborn errors of meta bolism (IEM) diagnosis is still unambiguous. To evaluate the NGS utility on the clinical field, targeted genic panel approach was designed for the dia gnosis of a set of IEM. The aim of the work was to compare the diagnostic yield of NGS in patients presenting consistent clinical and biochemical sous picion of IEM with those with no specific biomarkers. Materials and methods: Subjects studied (n,146) were classified in 2 cate gories: Group 1 (n,81), patients with consistent clinical and biochemical suspicion of IEM; Group 2 (n,65), cases with clinical suspicion of IEM but with unspecific or negative biomarkers. 175 genes (defects in amino acids, organic acids, free fatty acid oxidation, neurometabolic and complex mole cules metabolism) were studied through HaloPlex Target Enrichment Sy stem and Illumina sequencing. Results: Definitive genetic diagnosis was achieved in 73 out of the 146 pati ents (50 %); in 12/146 (8.2 %) only one mutation or variants with uncertain significance were detected in candidate genes; and in 61/146 (41.8%), no mutations were found. For group 1, the diagnostic yield was 78% (63 out of 81). This rate went down to 15.4% (10 out of 65) in group 2 (X2 , 76.171; p < 0.0001).

25440,"Introduction: Newborn screening (NBS) in Norway is mandated for 20 In born Errors of Metabolism (IEM). Rapid genotyping after a positive NBS result may have a major impact on follow up and treatment. Using NBS screening samples we evaluated next generation sequencing using a large gene panel as 2nd tier tests for IEM. Materials and Methods: Six samples with known diagnoses (1 PKU+TFP , 1 CPT2, 2 PA and 2 MMA) were included, 5 with known genotype. DNA (~1.8ng) extracted from the NBS dried blood spots was amplified with the IonAmpliSeq IEM panel (570 genes) and sequenced on IonTorrent PGM. Us ing Ion Reporter software, the detected variants were filtered to only show variants within the 32 relevant NBS IEM genes, in exonic or splice regions, with 5000Exomes Global MAF<0.01.Results: In total 1740 2122 variants were detected in each sample, with 2 12 variants remaining after initial filtering. In the 5 previously geno typed samples, all disease causing variants were confirmed. In one MMA sample with unknown genotype, only three potential variants remained after filtering, including the two which likely account for the phenotype: NM_052845.3(MMAB):[c.291 1G>A(;)c.571C>T]. The results were available within 3 days after DNA extraction. Conclusion: The tested workflow may reduce turn around time for geno typing substantially, and show the possibility of quickly confirming positive metabolic screening even with large genes and multiple disease genes in volved. Bioinformatic filtering before variant evaluation avoids incidental findings outside the screening mandate genes and drastically shortens anal ysis time.

We present two cases of infantile mitochon drial disease with pathogenic mutations in QRSL1 (hGatA) involved in Glu tRNAGln amidotransferase (Glu Adt), which is composed of three subunits, hGatC, hGatA and hGatB. Patients and methods: A girl (Pt250) suddenly suffered from hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis on day 1. Subsequently tachypnea, hypertrophic cardio myopathy, adrenal insufficiency and hearing loss appeared. She died of car diac failure at 5 months. Another girl (Pt860) developed cyanosis and lactic acidosis on day 3. She died of interstitial pneumonia at 2 months. We perfor med enzyme analysis, whole exome sequencing and their validation tests. Results: The enzyme analysis showed combined respiratory chain defici encies (I, III, and IV) in both cases. The whole exome sequencing revealed Pt250 harbored a homozygous mutation c.398G>T (p.

To identify genetic factors involved we meta analyzed all studies where first phase insulin secretion has been in vestigated through intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) and where GWAS (n,4834) or metabochip (n,741) data was available. Methods: The traits Acute Insulin Response to glucose (AIR), Peak Insulin (PI) and Disposition Index (DI) were defined. Variants were imputed using the 1000G reference panel and tested for association using linear regression adjusted for age and sex and in an additional analysis also for BMI. Results: A common T2D variant in MTNR1B was associated with the IVGTT traits at genome wide significance (PI p,2.5ÃÂ10 26, AIR p,4.3ÃÂ10 19, DI p,3.3ÃÂ10 17) and variants in CDKAL1 with both PI(p,4.9ÃÂ10 15) and AIR(p,9.5ÃÂ10 13), these variants also influenced oral glucose stimulated insulin secretion (OGTT). Other common T2D variants were associated at p<0.01 revealing potential mechanisms for these variants. Variants in IGF2BP2 andADCY5 influenced the IVGTT but had little effect on the OGTT suggesting they exert direct effects on the pancreas rather than systemic effects. Putative novel associations were observed on chromosome 7, 11 and 2 (p<5ÃÂ10 8) but these variants need further validation. Conclusion: Our genome wide analysis on the largest dataset for intrave nously measured insulin secretion showed that T2D risk alleles at the MT NR1B and CDKAL1 loci were strongly associated with our measures and it provides new insight into physiological mechanisms of other diabetes risk variants.",2016
25444,"Krabbe disease is a very rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage dis order caused by deficiency of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase (galacto sylceramidase). Traditionally diagnosis relied on measurement of enzyme deficiency using a radiolabelled natural substrate; a method in use at our laboratory for well over 30 years. Subsequently a more convenient fluo rimetric substrate has been implemented in some laboratories, however there are known (albeit infrequent) issues with this methodology including false positive and negative results. Most laboratories are now using GALC gene analysis as a first or second line test for Krabbe disease. A recurrent 30kb GALC deletion has been identified in some populations however many GALC variants are family specific and therefore definitive enzyme analysis (either pre or post DNA testing) can be invaluable for confirmation of a diagnosis. Sanger sequencing of the GALC coding region has been carried out in 32 families at our centre to date. We present several patients with novel pathogenic variants and also several patients with a false positive en zyme deficiency caused by a non pathogenic sequence variant (c.550C>T) which is thought to confer reduced enzyme activity in vitro (possibly more frequently observed with the fluorimetric enzyme methodology).

MODY3 is misdiagnosed as Type1 Diabetes due to the similar clinical features. miRNAs are involved in the development of diabe tes, diabetic complications, insulin expression. The present study explores the functional miRNAs in the pathogenesis of MODY3 by determining the HNF1A regulated miRNA/miRNAs in MIN6 cells. Materials and Methods: Glucose stimulated MIN6 cells, expressing HNF1A endogenously, were transfected with the human HNF1A cDNA expression vector for overexpression and with siRNA binding to HNF1A mRNA to si lence HNF1A expression. Overexpression and silencing were confirmed with RT qPCR and Western Blotting. The HNF1A regulated miRNA/miRNAs was determined by RNA Seq of the total RNA extract in the HNF1A overex pressed and silenced cells. Results: 238 known and 91 novel miRNAs showed significantly differential expression when total RNA extract expression from HNF1A overexpressed and silenced cells were compared. Previously known miR 129 1 3p, miR 129 2 3p, miR 200b 3p, miR 296 3p, and miR 378a 5p, associated with diabetes in the literature, showed the most significant differential expres sion. Conclusion: This study revealed presence of HNF1A regulated known and novel miRNAs in MIN6 cells. The most significantly differentially expressed 5 miRNAs are selected as candidate miRNA molecules in the pathogenesis of MODY3. Validation of the candidate miRNAs and their effect on insulin secretion in MIN6 cells are in progress.

MODY3 associated with HNF1A gene mutations is the most common form of MODY. HNF1A is a transcription factor that regulates a number of liver specific genes and genes involved in glucose metabolism. Materials and Methods: The functional properties of HNF1A gene variations (p. T10M, p. S345K) which were identified in Turkish MODY patients were analyzed. The effects of the candidate mutations on HNF1A transactivation function were determined by dual luciferase reporter assay. The effects of mutations on the nuclear localization of HNF1A were analyzed by immu nofluorescence confocal microscopy. DNA binding activity of mutant HNF1A and wild type proteins were also compared by colorimetric DNA protein binding assay. Results: Dual luciferase assay results showed that both p. T10M and p. S345K mutant proteins have similar transactivation activity as the wild type HN F1A. Immunostaining studies revealed that p. T10M mutant protein localize in the nucleus as the wild type HNF1A while p. S345K mutant protein is in the cytoplasm. DNA binding ability of p. T10M mutant protein was reduced, but p. S345Y mutant similar compared to wild type. Conclusion: Preliminary results showed that both mutant HNF1A proteins have reduced activities and malfunctions compared to wild type.

The iPSCs generated have been characterized and presented the hallmarks for the se cells: (1) typical iPSC like morphology and growth characteristics, (2) conservation of the mutations identified in the three patients, (3) positive staining for alkaline phosphatase activity, (4) expression of pluripotency associated markers (OCT4, NANOG and SOX2) and surface markers (SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA1 60, and TRA1 81), (5) demethylation of the OCT4 and NANOG promoters, (6) normal karyotype and (7) differentiation potential into all three primary germ cell layers in vitro. Our next step will be the iPSC diffe rentiation into neurons, hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes serving as an in vivo platform for modeling these two disorders of propionate metabolism.

25449,"Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) and propionic acidemia (PA), inborn meta bolic diseases inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, are the most fre quent organic acidurias. However, each of them is classified as rare disease since their incidences are estimated at ~ 1:50 000 for MMA and ~ 1:100 000 150 000 for PA. Specific mitochondrial enzymatic deficiencies in the catabolism of branched chain amino acids cause MMA and PA. Four MMA and one PA patients from Serbia were analyzed. We detected five previously described variants: p. Asn219Tyr, p. Arg369His p. Val553Glyfs*17 in MUT, p. Thr198Serfs*6 in MMAA , p. Ile144_Leu181del in PCCB gene and four novel genetic variants: p. Leu549Pro, p. Glu564*, p. Leu641Pro in MUT and p. Tyr206Cys in PCCB gene. In silico and eukaryotic expression studies confirmed pathogenic effect of all novel variants. Aberrant enzymes p. Leu549Pro MUT , p. Leu641Pro MUT and p. Tyr206Cys PCCB did not show residual activity in activity assays. In addi tion, activity of MUT enzymes was not rescued in the presence of vitamin B12 precursor in vitro which was in accordance with non responsiveness or partial responsiveness of patients to vitamin B12 therapy. Our study brings the first molecular genetic data and phenotypic characte ristics for MMA and PA patients for Serbia and the whole South Eastern Eu ropean region.

25450,"Mitochondria are the powerhouses of all eukaryotic cells which produce energy in a process called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Complex I (CI), the first and the biggest of five multi protein complexes that compo se the mitochondrial OXPHOS system, consists of both mitochondrially and nucleus encoded subunits. Because of its size and its dual genetic origin, biogenesis of CI is a complex event that requires a set of not yet completely characterized assembly factors. Mutations in genes encoding either CI struc tural subunits or assembly factors result in isolated CI deficiency, which re presents the most common cause of OXPHOS dysfunction. Using whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing, we identi fied TMEM126B as a disease causing gene in three unrelated patients pre senting with exercise intolerance and muscle weakness due to isolated CI deficiency. TMEM126B is a putative CI assembly factor that is not well cha racterized and its mutations led to the accumulation of CI assembly interme diates in patient fibroblasts. Lentiviral complementation with the wild type cDNA restored the assembly of CI confirming the pathogenic nature of the identified mutations and establishing TMEM126B as a novel mitochondrial disease gene.",2016
25451,"Introduction: It is known that environment has an impact on epigenomes, especially of cancer cells. It is, however, not clear how this occurs. A hall mark of cancer cells is energy reprogramming whereby glycolysis is prefer red over OXPHOS. We propose that mitochondrias might play a role in epi genome modifications. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in aberrant methylation of nuclear genes. Methods: Methylation analyses of 26 nuclear genes were performed by MS MLPA on: leucocytes and muscle samples from 23 mitochondrial disease patients; human skeletal muscle (HSkM) cell line treated with Rotenone, an OXPHOS inhibitor. OXPHOS function was determined by Trimethylrodamine esther stain and quantifications on confocal microscopy were performed using ImageJ. Methylation was analyzed by GeneMarker v1.95.Results: muscle samples from patients presented higher frequency of aber rantly methylated genes than leucocytes (p,0,02). Caspase8 was the most frequently methylated gene in muscle (76,9% vs 0% in leucocytes). Unex pectedly, experiments in OXPHOS inhibited HSkM cells revealed changes in the methylation of a single gene: Caspase8. The methylation status of this gene was augmented when the mitochondrial membrane potential came down due to Rotenone action and reverted when Rotenone was removed. Conclusions: Our observations indicate that mitochondriaÃ¢ÂÂs dysfunction is related to methylation alterations in nuclear genes. These epigenetic fin dings could contribute in the practice, to explain the wide phenotypic spectrum of mitochondrial diseases. In addition, this suggests that mitochon drias have a potential role in the link between environment and epigenome. Grant: National University of Cuyo, Argentina.",2016
25452,"Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing the diagnostic and research screening for rare diseases, particularly for those genetically and clinically heterogeneous like primary mitochondrial disor ders. NGS approaches are particularly suitable for investigating the causati ve mutations in small families and even in single individuals, for which the traditional linkage analysis is limited. These technologies, in fact, are con tributing to deepen the knowledge on the heterogeneous genetic causes of mitochondrial diseases and to significantly reduce the percentage of cases lacking a molecular diagnosis, with several new disease genes discovered. In this study we analyzed a cohort of 125 patients, that failed to show mu tations in mtDNA and in specific nuclear genes after traditional SangerÃ¢ÂÂs sequencing, performing a combined, two step strategy, based on targeted genes panel as a first NGS screening, followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) in still unsolved cases. This approach has allowed us to reach a mole cular diagnosis in the 20% of these difficult cases, but it has also revealed unexpected and conceptually new findings. These include the possibility of marked variable penetrance of recessive mutations, the identification of large scale DNA rearrangements, which explain spuriously heterozygous cases, and the association of mutations in known genes with clinical pheno types never described before. Importantly, WES on selected cases allowed us to discover pathogenic mutations in genes encoding non mitochondrial proteins, an observation that widens the complex genetic heterogeneity of mitochondrial disease and suggests a new area of investigation in mitochon drial medicine.",2016

25454,"Maple syrup urine disease syndrome (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disease resulting from deficient function of the branched chain alpha ketoacid de hydrogenase complex (BCKD), responsible for degradation of branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. BCKD is composed of four components, E1a, E1b, E2, and E3, whereas variants in genes coding for E1a (BCKDHA ), E1b (BCKDHB) and E2 (DBT) lead to MSUD (MIM# 248600). In this study, we analyzed 4 Serbian patients diagnosed with MSUD accor ding to biochemical data and clinical symptoms. We used Sanger sequencing for targeted analysis of BCKDHA , BCKDHB and DBT genes. In BCKDHA gene, we detected two previously described variants, c.1312T>A (p. Tyr438Asn) and c.861_868delAGGCCCCG (p. Gly288Valfs*11), and also two novel mis sense variants, c.581A>G (p. His194Arg) and c.892G>A (p. Val298Met). In BCKDHB gene, we detected one previously described variant, c.410C>T (p. Ala137Val), and a novel deletion, c.857_871del15 (p. Glu286_Met290del). All novel missense variants were predicted to be damaging by PolyPhen2, SIFT , PROVEAN and MutPred algorithms, and the protein sequence align ment using Clustal Omega pointed out to evolutionary conservation of af fected residues. Protein modeling using I TASSER showed that both novel BCKDHA variants lead to improper folding of the protein and thus result in an unstable protein.

25455,"The main purpose of expanded newborn screening (NBS) is to diagnose ge netic disorders at an earlier step to start treatment before the appearance of clinical symptoms. In metabolic disorders, quantification of amino acids and acylcarnitines in dried blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry al lows the detection of more than 30 different pathologies. The entire dia gnosis process requires further sample collection for a second tier test and genetic confirmation. In this work, we present our experience with the use of massive parallel sequencing (MPS) for genetic analysis of 84 consecutive DNA samples from newborns referred to confirm the results of the Spanish NBS program. The analysis was done by a customized panel to capture the sequence of the more frequent actionable metabolic disorders. Additionally, Illumina clinical exome TruSightOneÃÂ® combined with a gene virtual captu re was used. Biallelic pathogenic mutations were found in 53 patients while only one mutation was detected in 24, in PAH, ACADM, ACADVL, GCDH, MCCC1, MCCC2, and SLC22A5. No mutations were found in some newborns with hyperphenylalaninemia or biochemical suspicion of VLCADD or GCDH deficiency. Pathogenic mutations (loss of function or previously described mutations) were found in 128 alleles while variants of unknown clinical si gnificance were detected in 18 alleles. In two newborns suspected to have a variant condition of MSUD and argininemia, pathogenic mutations were de tected for the first time in BCAT2 and SLC7A1 respectively. The results show the usefulness of MPS as second tier test for diseases confirmation and for differential diagnosis of metabolic disorder.

Lango Allen, S. E. Flanagan, C. Shaw Smith, M. Wakeling, T . Laver, A. T . Hattersley, S. Ellard; University of Exeter Medical School, Exeter, United Kingdom. A genetic diagnosis of neonatal diabetes (NDM) guides clinical management and can lead to improved treatment. Approximately 15% of patients born to consanguineous parents donÃ¢ÂÂt have mutations in known genes. The aim of this study was to identify novel recessive causes of NDM to gain insights into mechanisms underlying pancreatic beta cell development and function. We performed exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping in 10 patients with NDM born to consanguineous parents in whom the known causes had been excluded. We identified homozygous likely pathogenic variants in 5/10 patients. Two genes, TMEM167A and CD274 , have not previously been linked to human di sease. TMEM167A encodes a protein important for vesicular transport and interacts with the product of a known NDM gene (IER3IP1 ). CD274 is essen tial for immune regulation and the knockout mouse phenotype supports an aetiological role. Three patients had mutations in previously reported disea se genes: EPG5 (regulates autophagy), SPATA5 and COQ9 (both important for mitochondrial function). Importantly for our patient, individuals with COQ9 mutations can be successfully treated with oral CoQ10 therapy. In addition to NDM, these three patients had clinical features overlapping previously reported cases. Although the possibility of a dual aetiology cannot be exclu ded, these genes encode proteins in pathways known to be affected in the pathophysiology of diabetes, supporting their role in NDM. Identification of further patients is required to confirm these findings.

Nine patients presented typical symptoms and / or specific metabolic profi le; others were with unclear or insufficient clinical data. Results: In 7 affected probands causative gene mutations were found (data shown in table). Sanger sequencing was performed for confirmation of the results. Conclusion: NGS of focused gene panels gives high diagnostic yield when applied to well defined patient groups. Identification of causative mutations is possible even in families with missing probands and may help for their ap propriate genetic counseling and medical management.

Most disease causing mtDNA mutations are hetero plasmic and the degree of heteroplasmy varies in different tissues. Thus, the determination of mutant loads in affected tissues is important in making the diagnosis and correlating clinical phenotype. Next Generation System (NGS) approach also allows simultaneous analyses of a group of genes or of the whole exome, thus, the mutations in causative gene(s) can be identified in one step. Objective: Aim of this study was to make genetic analysis in a much faster and more efficient way; and to identify the specific degree of heteroplasmy. Methods: Nextera XT Illumina platform was used and NGS analysis has been performed on 52 DNA blood samples. Results: Data analysis confirmed the classical mutation 8344R in a sample used as a positive control and showed the presence of risk factors as 7080, 13889 and 12634.

Genotyping results were analyzed in correlation with obesity, obesity parameters (weight, BMI) and complicati ons (diabetes, flebitis, hypertension, prostate cancer). Lifestyle risk factors were considered (environment, smoking, alcohol, coffee). Allele frequencies were calculated and compared with literature. Results. Intron 1 of the FTO gene (16q12.2) had the strongest signal (10 4 10 5 p values) when associated with weight, BMI and obesity level (18 highly correlated SNPs). A locus on chromosome 7 (7q31.1) showed lower associations (3 SNPs). FTO SNPs also revealed strong correlations with diabetes, especially in obese. Hypertension was found associated with po lymorphisms on chromosomes 4, 12 and 13 (BANK1, PPP3CA, AT2B, FRY genes) but not obesity mediated.

We present the results of molecular genetic analyses in a newborn male with typical biochemical markers of OTCD who died due to severe hyperammonemia and multiorgan failure seven days after birth. Methods: Genomic DNA from blood and cDNA from postmortem liver were amplified by PCR, and respective PCR products were analyzed by Sanger se quencing. The extent of the genomic deletion was determined by sequencing PCR products containing the deletion boundaries, and confirmed by MLPA. Results: Amplification of genomic DNA did not yield any PCR product of exon 2, Sanger sequencing did not reveal any other changes in the remai ning exons. A 2,325 bp large deletion starting 2,113 bp upstream of exon 2 and ending 73 bp in intron 2 was identified in genomic DNA. Congruently, deletion of exon 2 was also observed in liver mRNA (r.78_216del, predicted p. Cys27Ilefs*10). In addition, an unexpected splicing variant with deletion of exons 2 4 (r.78_386del, p.

Until now, more than 950 variants were identified in the PAH gene. Novel missense mutations p. F233I, p. R270I and p. F331S in this gene were found in the Slovak population. Previously, we performed PAH functional assays for testing the impact of these mutations on the functionality of PAH protein using prokaryotic expression system. In this work, we focused on the expression of PAH mutated proteins in eu karyotic cell line HepG2 in the presence of sepiapterin which acts as the precursor of BH4. However some authors report that BH4 has no effect on PAH mRNA expression and has only effect on proper protein folding, other research papers report that PAH mRNA expression is increased in presence of BH4. Therefore we performed Real Time PCR and Western blot analyses to investigate the impact of sepiapterin on the level of mRNA and mutated PAH proteins.

25466,"Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disease that, if is untreated, will impaire cognitive development resulting from a neurotoxic effect of hyper phenylalaninemia (HPA); the associated clinical phenotype varies and the potential genotype phenotype correlations would help in understanding the pathophysiology of this disease. Its metabolic phenotype is accountab le to multifactorial origins both in nurture [where the normal nutrition in troduces L phenylalanilne] and in nature, where mutations (>520 alleles) occur in the PAH gene. The allelic variation at the PAH locus yield greater or lesser risk of impaired cognitive development according to the degree of HPA. The clinical evaluation of a group of 20 PKU patients (with different stage of treatment) from neurology section of Cluj Children Hospital, Roma nia, was done according to The MÃÂ±nchen development scale for the children with mental age below 3 years, with The Simon Binet test for children with mental age 3 7 years and with The RavenÃ¢ÂÂs Progressive Matrices for those above 7 years. Biochemical phenotypes associated were included in severe PKU when the level of Phe is above 1200 ÃÂ¼mol/l, moderate PKU (Phe: 600 1200 ÃÂ¼mol/l) or mild HPA for Phe: 120 600 ÃÂ¼mol/l. The leukocyte DNA was isolated and using polymerase chain reaction with subsequent restriction analysis, we identified patients homozygous for mutation R408W (more than 50%), patients compound heterozygotes for R408W/L48S, R408W/R413P , R261Q/IVS12+1>a, Y268C/ IVS12+1>a, or R408W/R261Q mutati ons.

25467,"miRNAs are regulatory short non coding RNAs involved in many cellular processes and pathological conditions, thus they have emerged as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in human diseases. In this work we have analysed the miRNA profile in plasma samples from patients with the rare metabolic disorder propionic acidemia (PA) and in different tissues from the hypomorphic murine model. PA is characterized by the toxic intracellu lar accumulation of propionyl CoA due to propionyl CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme deficiency and usually presents as a neonatal form with patients developing neurological deficits and cardiomyopathy in the long term. We have used a qRT PCR miRnome panel to analyse the expression of 752 miRNAs in Pcca / (A138T) mouse liver and in plasma samples from PA pa tients and controls. In mouse, we have found 14 significantly dysregulated miRNAs from which three also exhibited altered plasma levels in PA pati ents. In mouse tissues we selected miR 34a 5p, miR 338 3p and miR 350 to investigate their potential targets in relation to PA pathology. The levels of the three miRNAs were found increased in brain and heart of the hypomor phic mice at different ages, correlating in some cases with a decrease in spe cific predicted targets such as BCL2, MEK1, p38, JNK and ATP5G1, involved in apoptosis, stress signalling and mitochondrial function. Taken together, our results point out to the role of miRNAs in PA pathophysiology and un derscore their potential use as biomarkers of the disease.",2016
25468," Introduction: The generation of mouse models for heteromeric amino acid transporters has been proved to be a powerful tool to understand the renal amino acid transport in mammals and subsequently our knowledge about aminoacidurias. Materials and Methods: We have generated and characterized a double loss of function mouse model for the two basolateral amino acid transporters LAT2 and TAT1 (hereafter, dKO). Animals were treated with a high protein content diet, amino acids were quantified in urine and plasma samples to assess renal function, and expression of amino acid transporters was analy zed by RT qPCR in the dKO, the single KOs and control mice. Results: We found a decreased reabsorption of aromatic and neutral amino acids and to a lesser extent, of basic ones and proline, which is exacerbated under rich protein diet. A strong renal phenotype in the dKO versus single ones supports a coordinated function of LAT2/4F2hc and TAT1 on the baso lateral transport in renal reabsorption. The expression analyses demonstra te the upregulation of one particular isoform of the basolateral transporter y+LA T1, and in a lesser extend of SNAT3.Conclusion: There is cooperation between LAT2/4F2hc and TAT1 in the renal reabsorption, where TAT1 supplies neutral amino acids for LAT2 ex changer. The dKO model presents a significant remaining tubular reabsorp tion of neutral amino acids suggesting the existence of compensation by other basolateral transporters. y+LAT1 and SNAT3 seem to be two of them. Altogether, our results provide new insights into the in vivo mechanisms of amino acid resabsorption in the kidney.",2016
25469," Sanfilippo C syndrome is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mu tations in the HGSNAT gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in hepa ran sulphate (HS) degradation. The enzyme deficiency causes the storage of partially degraded HS molecules inside the lysosome. The disease has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and is characterized by a severe and progressive neurodegeneration for which no effective treatment exists. Previously, we demonstrated, on Sanfilippo C patientsÃ¢ÂÂ fibroblasts, that the use of siRNAs targeting EXTL2 and EXTL3, genes involved in HS synthesis, could be effective as a short term substrate reduction therapy (SRT).Here, we have used five different lentiviruses encoding shRNAs targeting EXTL2, to analyse the effect of a long term treatment.

25470,"Studies trying to elucidate the pathophysiology of obesity consistently de scribe a highly heterogeneous disorder at the clinical and molecular level, with high heritability. At least 10 genes, mostly with recessive inheritance, have been reported to cause monogenic severe obesity, and there are a few more candidates of strong effect in association studies. The aim of this study was to establish the contribution of rare genetic va riants in candidate genes to early onset obesity (BMI>3SDS, <3y). Using a pooled DNA sequencing approach, which allows analyzing many samples with reduced costs, we screened 15 candidate genes for obesity in a cohort of 480 patients and 480 controls (BMI<P50). We focused on very rare vari ants found in single or few individuals per cohort. Seven of the 15 genes (BDNF, FTO, MC3R, MC4R, NEGR1 , PPARG and SIM1 ) were differentially represented between patients and controls; we identi fied 30 rare variants in patients and 5 in controls (p,0.0001). The difference of probably pathogenic variants (15 in patients vs 1 in controls) was also significant (p,0.0005); all were single allele changes and none of the indivi duals carried more than one variant. Our data reveal a higher burden of rare and probably pathogenic heterozy gous variants in several candidate genes in patients with severe early onset obesity compared to controls. Our results reinforce the role of the melano cortin pathway and bring to light other genes that may carry highly pene trant obesogenic single allele variants, like FTO, PPARG and BDNF.

25471,"Introduction: Obesity is a multifactorial disorder with high heritability (50 75%), probably higher in early onset and severe cases. Although rare mono genic forms and several genes and regions of susceptibility, including CNVs, have been defined, the genetic causes underlying the disease still remain largely unknown. Methods: We studied a cohort of Spanish children with severe (BMI>3SDS) non syndromic early onset (<3y) obesity (EOO). We obtained molecular karyotypes of 157 cases. Large (>100kb) and rare (<1/2,000 controls) CNVs were validated, segregated in the family, and studied in a larger sample (323 EOO cases/480 controls). Additionally, mutation analysis of the genes al tered by CNVs (n,16) was completed in both cohorts by NGS using a pooled DNA strategy. Results: A higher burden of duplication type CNVs was detected in EOO cases versus controls (OR,1.85, p value,0.008). Likely pathogenic CNVs in cluded duplications of glutamate receptor (GRIK1, GRM7), the X linked gas trin peptide receptor (GRPR) and the NPY genes, all inherited from obese parents. Results were replicated by MLPA in the extended cohort. By NGS focusing the analysis on rare variants, we identified a missense mutation in NPY, a nonsense mutation in GRIK1, and 5 missense mutations in GRPR in EOO cases, but no mutations in controls. Conclusions: Our data reveal a higher burden of rare CNVs and point mu tations in patients with EOO compared to controls. Genes altered by CNVs are candidates for contributing to the pathogenesis of morbid EOO. Among these, NPY, GRPR and two glutamate receptors are likely involved in highly penetrant, monogenic and familial obesity. Grants: FIS PI1302481/PI1302195 FEDER, 2014SGR1468",2016
25472,"Introduction: Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a multiple malformati on syndrome caused by 7 dehydrocholesterol reductase enzyme deficiency. Decreased cholesterol, elevated 7 dehydrocholesterol (7 DHC) and oxida tive derivatives of 7 DHC are putative pathophysiological factors of SLOS. According to literature vitamin E is effective in reducing 7 DHC derived oxysterols in cultured SLOS fibroblasts. We have started a study on clinical effects of vitamin E in SLOS in 2014.Materials and Methods: Seven SLOS patients were enrolled in the study re ceiving 230 mg (age: 4 10 years) or 2x230 mg (above 10 years) RRR alpha tocopheryl acetate beside cholesterol supplementation. Plasma vitamin A and E concentrations were monitored regularly by HPLC. Behavioral effects of the therapy were determined using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. During follow up, upon anecdotal reports of the parents, we created another questionnaire focusing on slee ping habits and photosensitivity as well in addition to behavior. Results: Patients were vitamin E deficient prior to therapy, while vitamin A concentrations were normal in all but one patient. Absorption of the vitamin was satisfactory, plasma vitamin E concentrations showed normalization in all patients. According to ABC improvement in irritability and stereotypic behavior was detected in one patient. Using our questionnaire positive ef fects on self injurious and stereotypic behavior, improvement of sleeping habits and photosensitivity were observed in four patients. Conclusions: Vitamin E deficiency is likely to be the consequence of higher utilization and not inadequate absorption and can be normalized using high treatment doses. Our results suggest potential benefit of vitamin E treat ment in SLOS.",2016

25474,"Attachment of carbohydrate chains to proteins is a common post transla tional modification occurring ubiquitously in mammalian cells. N Glycosyla tion pathways use the lipid carrier dolichol (Dol) as an obligate precursor. Mutations in the genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of Dol cause deficiencies in cellular function and lead to a variety of debilitating diseases called congenital disorders of glycosylation type I. One of the vari ants, SRD5A3 CDG, is caused by nonsense mutations in the gene encoding polyprenol reductase, SRD5A3 , which plays a crucial role in the dolichol cyc le by catalyzing conversion of polyprenol to dolichol. Decreased content of dolichyl phosphate affects the assembly of the Dol linked Glc 3Man9GlcNAc2 glycan and its transfer to proteins upon N glycosylation. Flp In technology was used to obtain several HEK293T cell lines expressing miRNA silencing endogenous SRD5A3 and simultaneously complemented with mutated variants of SRD5A3.

WD affects from 1/30000 to 1/100000 individu als worldwide. ATP7B gene (MIM #606882), responsible for WD, is a copper transporter P ATPase that plays a key role in incorporating copper into ce ruloplasmin and moving excess copper out of the liver. Over 200 different mutations have been identified in the ATP7B gene. Materials and Methods: Patients with clinical evidence of WilsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease were remitted to our service for genetic testing. Analysis of the ATP7B was done by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) was performed in all patients in order to detect deletions/duplications in the ATP7B gene. Results: Twenty unrelated patients were analyzed. Four of them carried pa thogenic variants at ATP7B. Table shows their biochemical characteristics and genotypes. Three patients were simple heterozygous for known mutati ons in ATP7B. One patient was compound heterozygous. Conclusions: Most of the patients with mutations in the ATP7B gene are simple heterozygous. This data can suggest the importance of conducting a thorough analysis of gene promoter ATP7B as well as finding new targets for molecular diagnosis of EW.",2016

Type II results from a combined deficiency of XDH/XO and aldehyde oxidase. Pa tients present with hematuria, renal colic, urolithiasis or even acute renal failure. Molybdenum cofactor deficiency (type III) is characterized by the lack of sulfite oxidase as well as XDH/XO and aldehyde oxidase activities. About 150 cases have been described so far. Materials and Methods: Hypouricemic patients were found from 3 800 blood and urine samples. Following tests were set up: a) evaluation of UA in serum and urine with exclusion of secondary causes of hypouricemia b) estimation of urinary xanthine, c) allopurinol loading test and finally XDH/XO activity assay in plasma with molecular genetic analysis. Results: Nine Czech cases were detected, which is one of the largest group worldwide, in the terms of the number of patients. All individuals had pro found hypouricemia as the first sign. Urinary concentrations of xanthine were in the range of 170 598 mmol/mol creatinine (ref.range: < 30 mmol/mol creatinine) . XDH/XO activities in plasma in two cases were 0 and 0.37 pmol/h/mL of plasma (ref.range:3.2 9.2 pmol/h/mL of plasma ). The non sense heterozygous mutation p. R825X was found in two patients.

Recent publications have pointed somatic mutations re sulting in copy neutral loss of heterozygosity(CN LOH) for part or full HLA haplotype. Patient:A 15 year old female previously diagnosed with AML M5 was re ferred to clinic with leukemia relapse. Bone marrow showed 97% of blasts. Cytogenetic analysis detected CALM AF10 fusion gene. FLT3, NPM1 muta tions were negative. Unrelated donor search was initiated. But, after two blocks of re induction chemotherapy she didnÃ¢ÂÂt achieve remission and developed sepsis, pneumonia. So, haploidentical HSCT was a treatment of choice. Unfortunately, the evidence of disease progression made it impos sible. Patient had to choose palliative care. Result:HLA typing by SBT and NGS indicated that the patient was homo zygous: A*02:01 B*18:01 Cw*07:01 DRB1*11:04 DQB1*03:01. Con firming result was obtained in registry of unrelated stem cell donors.

MATERIAL METHOD: MEFV (exons 2,3,5,10), TNFRSF1A (exon 2 7), MVK (exon 2 11) and NLRP3 (exon 3) were sequenced in 286 pediatric patients. Two groups were studied:one included 194 patients with AID and the other, 92 FMF patients without MEFV gene mutations (FMF WT).RESULTS: In AID group, 10% NLRP3, 6% TNFRFS1A, 21% MVK and 32% MEFV mutations were detected. Overall mutation rate was %38; the rate was 3% for pathological mutations. In FMF WT group, 20% NLRP3 and 29% MVK mutations were detected.

25482,"Tight junction structures (TJ) are crucial for intestinal epithelium homeo stasis as they control the paracellular flux and maintain the apico basal po larity of intestinal cells. In celiac disease (CD), disrupted barrier function and increased paracellular permeability are observed, and these could be due to TJ disassembly caused by gliadin induced innate and adaptive immu ne responses. Gene expression analysis showed a deregulation of TJ related pathways in small intestinal mucosa in CD and interestingly, altered expres sion of several genes including TJP1 (TJ assembly), INADL (apico basal po larity) and PPP2R3A (negative control of cell growth and division) were not reversed after >2 years on gluten free diet, suggesting genetic involvement. To determine the effect of gliadin and the genetic background on epitheli al barrier integrity, we performed functional and expression studies in an intestinal epithelium model, the Caco 2 subclone C2BBe1. Incubation with pepsin trypsin digested gliadin (PTG) for 4 hours was able to inhibit the for mation of cell monolayers but not to disrupt the integrity of those previously formed. When genes crucial for TJ formation were silenced by siRNA, PTG stimulation resulted in the alteration of the TJ pathway and other connected networks, specially Toll like receptor signaling. Downregulation of central genes in the TJ pathway (TJP1, TJP2 or TJP3) resulted in increased expres sion of several chemokines. Constitutive altered expression of TJ genes in CD might result in an immature gut barrier that could in turn enhance CD related gliadin toxicity and result in the activation of proinflammatory cyto kine response.",2016

In the novel region, CCNT2 and R3HDM1 were constitutively underexpressed in disease, even after gluten removal. Moreover, several genes within this region were coexpressed in patients, but not in controls. Other novel genes, like KIF21B, REL and SORD showed altered expression in active disease. Apart from the identification of novel CD loci, these results suggest that ancestry based stratified analysis is a useful approach for association studies in complex diseases.",2016
25484,"Introduction: Chromosomal translocations are major portion of molecular rearrangement that detected on leukemic subtypes and depending on type of fusion genes, involved in the leukemogenesis. Therefore, accurate scree ning of this rearrangements is very important in leukemia type identificati on and appropriate therapeutic approaches. Materials and Methods: To identify chromosomal rearrangements in pati ents with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we used a multiplex RT PCR protocol in which more than 80 chromo somal breakpoint containing different variants of 29 prevalent translocati ons were monitored. Of note, a deletion and one duplication, in 8 parallel ne sted PCR reactions, in the presence of optimized primers was also assessed. Results: In a retrospective analysis on pooled samples from 20 afflicted AML and ALL patients, at least one chromosomal rearrangement was detected by multiplex RT PCR in 50% of AML and 45% of ALL cases. The efficiency of multiplex RT PCR method used here was investigated by analysis of avai lable cell lines as positive control for translocations and sequencing of PCR products. Conclusions: Here, we notified that the use of multiplex RT PCR method could promisingly identify the molecular abnormalities involved during translocation of either AML or ALL patients. Another prominent of this me thod is that even in low amount of sample can be considered as a potential diagnostic method.",2016
25485,"Introduction: Chimeras are defined as individuals whose cells are derived from two or more zygotes. Here we report a case of congenital blood chi merism identified by implementing various genotyping technologies in a Chinese patient. Materials and Methods: The patient with ventricular septal defect from Shanghai ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Medical Center was one of fraternal twins and had no history of transfusion and transplantation. Blood grouping was performed with standard gel centrifugation test cards. ABO genotyping was determi ned with polymerase chain reaction followed with direct sequencing and clone sequencing. Short tandem repeats analysis was further performed on the blood sample. Results: The patientÃ¢ÂÂs red cells were mix filed agglutination with anti A antibody , which showed a double populations of O and A red blood cells, whereas his parents were normal type B and type A respectively. Molecu lar typing showed that normal B101/O02 and A102/O01 genotypes were identified in his parents respectively, however, the patient exhibited the A102,O01,O02 three alleles. Moreover, short tandem repeats analysis of the patient revealed three alleles for D5S818,D2S1338,D19S433,vWA,D12S391 and D18S51 loci. We hypothesized that an exchange of blood cells between the fetuses occurred in utero and the additional alleles were contributed by his twin sibling. Conclusions: Using various molecular methods, we identified the blood chi merism in a Chinese patient and provided a basis for further study of this case. Our research also implicated that performing genotyping techniques could reveal the genetic backgroud of blood chimerism and take a deep un derstanding of the rare case of tetragametic chimerism.

25486,"Introduction: Frequent upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and deve lopment of susceptibility to URI in childhood, results from complex interac tions among host genetic factors, exposure to pathogens, and environmental influences. The goal of this study was to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes and susceptibility to URI in childhood. Materials and Methods: The study enrolled 82 children susceptible to URI and OM and 61 children not susceptible to URI, as a control group, who were exposed to similar environmental/host risk factors (atopic manifestations, day care attendance, passive smoking, breastfeeding). DNA of all child ren was studied for specific SNPs in cytokine genes. Genotyping for IL10 1082AÃ¢ÂÂG, IL10 3575TÃ¢ÂÂA, TNFA 308GÃ¢ÂÂA, IL2 330TÃ¢ÂÂG and IL6 597GÃ¢ÂÂA were performed on 7500 Real Time PCR System, using TaqMan pre desi gned assays, while genotyping for CD14 159CÃ¢ÂÂT was performed by using PCR and restriction enzyme digestion with Hae III. Results: The incidence of IL10 1082 polymorphic genotypes (GA/GG) was significantly higher in children susceptible to URI and OM, than in control group (RR 1.145, 95 % CI 1.011 1.298; p,0.047). Children with high produ cing IL10 1082 (GA/GG) genotypes, exposed to passive smoking, day care attendance, lack of breastfeeding and with allergic manifestations, were more likely to develop susceptibility to URI and OM. Conclusion: This study pointed out that IL10 1082 polymorphic genotypes (GA/GG) are associated with increased risk for susceptibility to URI and OM in childhood. Avoidance of environmental risk factors may modify the risk for URI and OM susceptibility children with IL10 1082 polymorphic geno types.",2016
25487,"Erythrocytosis is a rare disorder characterised by increased red cell mass and elevated haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit. Several causative genes have been identified in pathways including oxygen sensing, erythro poiesis and oxygen transport. Despite screening for such genes, in many pa tients no causative variant is identified. In this study, we combined whole genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted next generation (NGS) sequencing approaches to identify novel genes for idiopathic erythrocytosis. WGS was performed on samples from 10 idiopathic erythrocytosis patients as part of the WGS500 project resulting in 4 novel candidate genes for ery throcytosis, EPO, GFIb, KDM6A and BHLHE41 being proposed. In order to evaluate the likely pathogenicity of these, we sought to replicate these variants by screening a cohort of 125 patients using a custom targeted NGS panel comprising the exonic regions of 21 genes, including the 4 novel genes arising from WGS500, 8 known erythrocytosis genes and 9 others as sociated with relevant biological pathways. As a result, 32 exonic rare variants across 36 patients (29%) were detec ted, of which 10 were known erythrocytosis causing variants and 22 were novel variants, some with high likelihood of functionality, for which familial segregation, replication and functional studies are underway to further evi dence of causality. Of particular interest is the discovery of an additional rare variant in EPO suggesting that this gene should be actively surveyed in idiopathic erythrocytosis patients. Finally we propose that the NGS panel could be used as a clinical tool, to improve accuracy of diagnosis of idiopa thic erythrocytosis.",2016
25488,"Background: Hemoglobin SOman results from double mutations in the ÃÂ² globin chain; the classic ÃÂ²S mutation (ÃÂ²6 GluÃ¢ÂÂVal), and a second mutation in the same chain (ÃÂ²121 GluÃ¢ÂÂLys) identical to that of HbOArab. In the literatu re only 6 carriers have been described. HbS Oman carriers can have severe clinical presentation matching sickle cell disease. Objective: Study the clinical pheno genotype, and cell biology of both carri ers of HbSOman and compound heterozygotes HbS SOman. Design/Method: A cross sectional study that includes all identified carriers of HbSOman and compound heterozygotes. Demographic and clinical phe notype data were collected, including family pedigrees that were tracked to the same grandmother indicating a founder effect. Hematological parame ters and HPLC were performed. Results: We identified 53 carriers, 27 males and 26 females and 6 HbS SOman patients, 4 males and 2 females, age range between 2 75 years. Hemoglobin range was 7.5 14.7 g/dl (11.9+1.6), and SOman 9.5 25.3% (15.9+3.7) for carriers, while Hb ranged from 3.2 7.8 g/dl (5.2+2.4) and SOman 6 24.6% (11.6+6.6) for compound heterozygotes. Clinical severity index correlated with the SOman percent in the carriers with a cut off va lue of 14% and with decreased production of ÃÂ± chains due to deletional or non deletional mutations; however, there were no such correlations in the compound heterozygotes who presented in early infancy with severe trans fusion dependence. Other genetic modifiers seem to have no effect. Conclusion HbSOman is a severe form of SCD; carriers can be severely sym ptomatic and compound heterozygotes present as thalassemia major with early transfusion dependence. HSOman cells have increased sickling and hemolytic characteristics.",2016
25489,"HLA G is an immunotolerogenic molecule whose expression is modulated in pathological situations (cancers, infectious, inflammatory and autoim mune diseases). Higher HLA G expression correlates with a reduction in transplant rejection. HLA G displays a high level of polymorphism in its 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 3Ã¢ÂÂuntranslated regions, we previously showed that haplotypes formed by these SNPs can predict sHLA G levels and lung transplantation outcome. Yet, the mechanisms modulating HLA G expression or clinical outcome are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to predict transcription factor binding sites each haplotype. To fully characterize HLA G variation in co ding and untranslated regions, we typed 500 healthy individuals by NGS. Data were analyzed by the Xegen Company. Using all SNPs, including 19 SNPs in transcription factor binding sites, we could define 35 haplotypes, 24 with estimated frequencies below 0.3%, and 11 with estimated frequen cies above 1%, the latter representing 96% of the 1,000 haplotypes inve stigated and their structure was similar to previously observed. Analysis of transcription factor binding site content revealed that all haplotypes carry multiple sites for SP1. Similarly, while all haplotypes display a progesterone receptor binding site, a mutation in this region characterizes the haplotype associated with poor lung transplantation outcome. Other haplotypes dis played specific binding sites for Oct 1, C/EBPÃÂ±, TEF 1, Elk or STAT . These results support that NGS technology offers a pertinent solution for complete HLA analysis in clinical context and that nucleotide variations in transcripti on factor binding sites can account for the modulation of HLA G expression and clinical outcomes.

25490,"Inherited Thrombocytopenias (IT) are a group of heterogeneous disorders caused by almost 30 genes. Although many genes have been identified since the introduction of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), almost half of IT pa tients still remains without a molecular diagnosis. As IT are characterized by a wide genetic heterogeneity, identification of novel disease genes is still challenging. In our cohort of 274 affected families characterized at the mole cular level, 5 genes are responsible for about 50% of cases, while the remai ning genes are responsible each for less than 2% of cases. To overcome this difficulty and describe novel IT genes, we performed WES in 107 patients (86 families) affected with autosomal dominant IT of unknown molecular origin. We compared the cumulative variant allele frequencies (sum of the allele frequencies of each variant) of each gene in our IT cases to that of a control cohort, consisting of the Exome Aggregation Consortium non Fin nish European samples (33.370 individuals) and we found 7 genes, affecting 22 families, significantly enriched in rare variants (f<1Ã¢ÂÂ¢10 5) in IT cases. Two genes (ACTN1, ETV6) are known to be causative for IT . The identified variants was confirmed to be pathogenic through segregation analysis and functional studies. For the other 5 genes, which are novel candidate genes, segregation analysis and screening of further IT patients are ongoing. Conclusions: the availability of a large patients cohort can overcome the problems due to genetic heterogeneity and led to the identification of 5 strong candidate IT genes in our cohort.",2016
25491,"Introduction: A cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (JAK), is encoded by Janus Ki nase 2 gene (JAK2), plays an important role in growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. A point mutation, characterized as V617F, is found mostly in Philedelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Recently, micro particles (MP) were related with the thromboembo lic complications. This study focuses on the role of JAK2 V617F in MP produc tion from endothelial cells (EC).Materials and Methods: Lentiviral vectors, carrying JAK wild type or mutant in addition to green fluorescent protein (GFP), were transfected to Human Embryonic Kidney cells by Lipofectamine. The viral particles were collected by ultracentrifugation and infected into Human Umbilical Vein EC. In order to isolate MPs, the infected EC culture supernatants were centrifuged and concentrated. The spectrophotometric evaluation of the MP was performed. After labeling of MPs with CD31, the flow cytometry analysis were perfor med with applying 0.5 0.9 ÃÂµm microbeads to set up MP gates. Results: In this study, we have successfully infected the lentiviral vectors into EC. The analysis of the infected EC supernatants was demonstrated that the MPs were composed of RNAs. Labeling the MPs with EC marker CD31 revealed the origin MPs to be EC and both JAK2 and JAK2 V617F increased the MP production 2 fold compared to GFP control. Conclusion: This study provides insight to understand the possible effects of JAK2 V617F on EC regarding to the MP production. Further studies might be helpful to understand the role of JAK2V617F on EC and as well as the role of MPs for thrombus formation.",2016
25492,"The killer immunoglobulin like receptors (KIR) genes belong to the immu noglobulin superfamily and are widely studied because of the critical role they play in coordinating the innate immune response to infection and di sease. Resolution of the complete KIR repertoire remains challenging as the region is repetitive and extremely polymorphic, both on the population and sequence level. All together, the KIR genes cluster spans ~150 kb of chro mosome 19q13.4. Highly accurate, contiguous, long reads, like those generated by SMRT Se quencing, when combined with target enrichment protocols, provide a straightforward strategy for generating complete de novo assembled KIR haplotypes. Here we generated complete diploid haplotypes of the KIR re gion for 8 individuals on the PacBio RS II platform. The haplotypes ranged in size from 75 kb to 250 kb and captured complete, phased sequence in formation, with one exception in which a gap of 1 kb was found. This par ticular example was later determined to be the largest and most complex haplotype in the cohort. Large structural variations within the region were also observed, with two haplotypes showing deletions spanning both the centromeric and telomeric regions and one other haplotype containing a large tB01 insertion. These data represent the first demonstration of de novo assembled KIR haplotypes derived from diploid human genomes using single molecule se quencing. The resulting sequences demonstrate the extensive diversity and heterogeneity of the KIR region, which makes investigation into this locus uniquely suited for long read single molecule sequencing.",2016
25493,"Introduction: Chromosomal rearrangements involving the human KMT2A gene (MLL, mixed lineage leukemia) are associated with development of acute leukemia. The presence of certain MLL rearrangements is an indepen dent prognostic factor and patients are usually treated according to high risk protocols. Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection provides an ob jective assessment of treatment response. However, MRD assays using MLL fusion transcripts as molecular markers usually do not provide sufficiently sensitive detection of residual leukemic cells. Methods: For the identification of MLL breakpoint sequences we used two different approaches. First approach was long range PCR followed by se quencing of the PCR products. Second approach included combination of conventional chromosome microdissection, next generation sequencing and sequencing of the final PCR products. Leukemia/patient specific se quences of the chromosomal breakpoint were used to develop MRD assays and enabled us to perform sensitive monitoring of MRD using qPCR in 9 acute leukemia patients. Results: We identified unique breakpoint sequences in 9 patients with acute leukemia. Using first approach we detected MLL/AF6, MLL/AF9 (2 pa tients), MLL/AF10, MLL/ENL (2 patients) and MLL/ELL. Second approach was used for identification of MLL/AF10 and MLL/AF4 breakpoints. Iden tification of unique breakpoint sequences was followed by the design of sufficiently sensitive MRD assays. The MRD levels of residual leukemic cells correlated with clinical outcome. Conclusion: MLL breakpoints could be identified by various methods (in verse PCR, panhandle PCR). Our results show other approaches for identi fication of unique MLL breakpoint sequences, which can be utilized for the design of the leukemia specific assay for MRD monitoring in patients with acute leukemia.",2016
25494,"Leukemia is the 12th most common cancer in Europe, affecting approxi mately 13 in 100000 people. As part of the European epigenome project BLUEPRINT , we have recently conducted a survey of DNA methylation in over 170 samples from diverse hematopoietic cell types including various leukemia subtypes. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 153Back to index Globally, we find that cells of the lymphoid lineage modulate their methylo me more than those of the myeloid lineage. Although many sites of dynamic DNA methylation coincide with tissue specific regulatory regions, a signi ficant proportion (particularly in terminally differentiated lymphoid cells) is associated with large partially methylated domains (PMDs) a tendency that is amplified in the related malignancies. They appear compact hetorochromatin, associated with repressive histone marks, low transcriptional activity and late replication timing. At the same time, these regions coincide with active regions of open chromatin in em bryonic stem cells, indicating that they might have originated from areas under Ã¢ÂÂlockdownÃ¢ÂÂ from the pluripotent state to ensure cell fate. We propose that PMDs represent higher order chromatin structures that are established early during lymphoid differentiation as part of lineage commit ment. Over time and with increasing number of cell replications these regi ons experience passive loss of methylation ultimately forming large domains of low and intermediate methylation. We find that in lymphoid leukemias these regions are further enlarged and contribute to low global methylation, presumably caused by the high proliferation rate that is a hallmark of most cancers. As such, we believe the chromatin structures underlying PMDs are of significant importance for cell identity and integrity.",2016

Congenital neutropenias usually are characterized by bacterial recurrent severe infections but chronic viral infection is not a part of the clinical picture of this group of rare diseases. Case presentation. A male without significant family history of chronic in fections or malignancy, who had at 4 years of age generalized warts with an evolution of 4 years was diagnosed accidentally at 11 years of age with mild neutropenia(700/mmc) and mild decreased platelet count(130.000/mmc).Bone marrow aspiration showed normal cellularity without any dys plastic feature. He was treated with Prednison and G CSF without response. Secondary causes of neutropenias were excluded by absence of drug admi nistration history, negative serology for HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, EBV and nega tive ANA, dsDNA, ANCA antibodies. Immunologic tests showed IgA,0,46g/l(0,7 4,32),IgG,6 g/l(6,44 11,96),IgM,2,12 g/l(0,52 3,57),BLf,270(300 500),TLf,2548(1400 2000),CD4+,1093(700 1100),CD8+,1381(600 900),NK,79(200 300).

We performed whole exome sequencing in the members of a large 6 genera tion pedigree with a hitherto unknown AID. Medical data were collected re trospectively. IL 1ÃÂ² and IL 18 concentrations were analyzed in plasma. Skin biopsies were obtained of lesional and uninvolved skin from three patients for routine histology and immunohistochemical staining of IL 1ÃÂ² and IL 17.Exome sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous c.1333T>C p.(Ser445Pro) variant in NLRC4. The variant segregated with the 13 affected family mem bers (LOD score 3.58). Prediction software programs (Sift, Polyphen) in dicated pathogenic properties. Moreover the variant is located next to the recently described p.(His443Pro) pathogenic mutation. In affected family members, the clinical phenotype was influenced by weather conditions, stress, and infection. Severity of the clinical phenotype varied considerably. In a subset of the patients, the clinical symptoms resolved promptly after anakinra treatment, while other patients responded only partially. Biop sies of lesional skin showed a unique lymfocytic histiocytic infiltrate in the dermis, unlike the histology of previously described autoinflammatory skin disease.

25497,"ADP ribosylation post transcriptional modification of proteins carried out by PARP1 is capable of shifting gene expression up and down. In human pro inflammatory macrophages (M1) PARP1 acts as a repressor of genes en coding cytokines and as indicated in our study the differentiation process of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and premonocytic cell line THP1 into ma crophages is associated with the loss of PARP1. Therefore, we searched for the mechanism responsible for PARP1 repression during pro inflammatory macrophage development. The differentiation of HSC and THP1 was indu ced with GM CSF and PMA, respectively. The expression of PARP1 was deter mined with real time PCR and western blot. The contribution of miRNA was verified using Ago2 inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid, RNA synthesis was monitored with nascent RNA capturing, cell cycle was analyzed with flow cytometry. Chromatin association with transcription factors was monitored with ChIP .The reduction of PARP1 protein in macrophages results from transcripti on repression of PARP1 gene as these cells demonstrate lower Pol2 occu pancy around TSS and de novo synthesis of PARP1 mRNA. Moreover, Ago2 inhibitor failed to rescue PARP1 decrease indicating that miRNA does not contribute to mRNA degradation. The treatment of proliferating macropha ge precursors with mimosine, which mimicks differentiation induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, triggered comparable decrease in PARP1 ex pression. Further analysis revealed the cell cycle dependent modulation of Sp1 interaction with PARP1 promoter as a mechanism responsible for the differentiation induced PARP1 transcriptional repression.

25499,"Introduction: Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are severe medical con ditions caused by non redundant defects of innate or adaptive immune re sponses, leading to recurrent, severe infections. Severely affected PID pati ents with an unknown genetic defect were selected for diagnostic exome sequencing. Methods: 160 PID cases were included in this study. First, variation in 294 genes known to cause PIDs are studied using an in silico filter during exome data analysis. Next, 102 patients without a genetic diagnosis after step 1 gave permission for exome wide analysis of the data. In selected cases in vitro stimulations of identified cytokine production capacity defects and provided additional functional evidence for the diagnosis. Results: Diagnostic exome analysis revealed (likely) pathogenic mutations in known PID genes in 32 cases (20%). Exome wide analysis led to identi fication of additional causative mutations in 10 cases, for which underlying genes have a known role in specific immunological pathways. One example with direct clinical implication of this approach was the characterization of the genetic, and functional defects in 3 patients with autoimmune lym phoproliferative syndrome type V and (de novo) CTLA4 mutations. Several studies suggest abatacept as treatment for patients with CTLA4 deficiency. Conclusion: Exome sequencing can provide a genetic diagnosis in a signi ficant number of patients with PIDs. It is important to perform exome wide analyses after an analysis of the known PID genes because many new PID genes are only just being discovered. The molecular diagnosis provided no vel insight in therapeutic options for a subset of our patients.",2016
25500,"The correlation between the genetic structure of the population and the dis tribution of genetic disorders supports a population perspective in medical genetics, especially in the field of rare monogenic disorders. The benefits are even higher if applied to population isolates. Finland presents a characteristic population history with a restricted num ber of founders, isolation, several population bottlenecks, and recent expan sion of the population. This has led to the enrichment of some deleterious variants and loss of others, creating a phenomenon called the Finnish Disea se Heritage (FDH). By definition, FDH disorders are more frequent in Finland than elsewhere. Within each disorder the majority (if not all) of the Finnish patients share the same founder Fin major mutation, again over represented in Finland. No netheless, FDH disorders are rare (1:10,000 1:100,000). Today, FDH com prises 36 disorders (32 autosomal recessive, two autosomal dominant, and two X chromosomal) with a disease spectrum spreading to all branches of medicine, but more consistently in pediatrics. Some FDH disorders can be effectively treated, assuming the correct diagnosis has been performed. Investigating by whole exome sequencing the molecular defects behind rare immune disorders in Finnish patients, we identified rare homozygous FDH Fin major variants in the CUBN (megaloblastic anemia) and RECQL4 genes (Ra padilino syndrome). In addition, we found a previously known disease associated AICDA variant causing primary antibody deficiency (HIGM2) as part of a founder haplo type. The variant is strongly enriched in Finland (~38.5 fold) compared to other populations with European ancestries, suggesting it as a potential Fin major mutation and HIGM2 as a newly found FDH disorder.",2016
25501,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients frequently have autoantibodies to ci trullinated peptides, suggesting the involvement of the citrullinating enzy mes, peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs), in RA. Previous linkage studies showed that a RA susceptibility locus included four PADI genes, however it was not clear which PADI gene confers RA susceptibility. Peptidylariginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) was identified as a susceptibility gene for RA in a trans ethnic meta genome wide association study (GWAS). PADI4 is one of the PADI gene family and converts arginine residue to citrulline residue. PADI4 is highly expressed in immune tissues and cells, especially bone mar row, macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes. Peptidylcitrulline is an im portant molecule in RA, because it is an antigen of ACPA and only PADI enzy mes (translated protein from PADI genes) can provide peptidylcitrullines by modification of protein substrates. To understand the importance of PADI4 gene in the progression of RA, we used Padi4 / mice and showed that PAD4 is significantly affected to progress of collagen induced arthritis (CIA) RA model mice. In Padi4 / CIA mice sera, the concentrations of serum anti CII IgM, IgG, and levels of inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly rather than in WT CIA mice. We demonstrated that Padi4 expression was in duced by CII immunization. In Padi4Ã¢ÂÂ/Ã¢ÂÂ mice, inflammatory cytokine levels were significantly decreased compared with those in wild type mice. Inte restingly, Padi2 expression was induced in immune cells of Padi4 / mice in compensation for the defect in Padi4. As the results, we suggested that Padi4 enhanced collagen initiated inflammatory responses.",2016

We evaluated digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) as a novel method for SCID detection. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from one 3mm DBS punch using wash steps and denaturation at 99ÃÂ°C. Simultaneous quantification of TREC and RNAseP (internal control) was performed using AutoDG and QX200 ddPCR Bio Rad system. A total of 10 diagnosed patient DBS (1 X linked SCID, 1 RAG1 Omenn syndrome, 2 idiopathic T cell lymphopenia (iTCL), 1 chr22q11.2 deletion negative TCL, 2 DiGeorge syndrome, 1 CHARGE syndro me, 1 ataxia telangiectasia and 1 cartilage hair hypoplasia) and 80 normal DBS (ageÃ¢ÂÂ¤7days, gestational ageÃ¢ÂÂ¥36weeks) were screened for TREC levels. Results are expressed in TREC/ul blood. Results: All previously diagnosed patient DBS were confirmed to contain Ã¢ÂÂ¤15 TRECs. Normal DBS ranged 46 276, average of 132 TRECs. Dilution ex periments showed LLOQ at 14 TRECs. LOD was 11 TRECs. Precision experi ments showed <20 %CV for intra assay (at 54 TRECs) and inter assay (at 60 TRECs) reproducibility. A reference range study is currently ongoing. Conclusions: We have developed a highly sensitive and accurate multiplexed ddPCR method for absolute quantification of TREC in DBS without the need for standard curve. The method is cost effective, high throughput and sui table for NBS testing.",2016
25504,"Introduction: In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) apoptosis is thought to be defective, producing increased extracellular DNA and dsDNA antibo dies. The p53 pathway is crucial in apoptosis regulation. We investigated if expression of enzymes (OGG1 and SIRT1) and transcription factor (FOXO1) involved in p53 pathway were altered in SLE, and associated with immune activation. Material and Methods: We studied 32 SLE patients (10 with active lupus nephritis (LN), 12 with inactive LN, and 10 SLE in absence of LN); and 20 healthy controls. The mRNA levels for p53, SIRT1, OGG1 and FOXO1 were quantified by RT qPCR in the urinary cellular pellet. Results: Urinary mRNA levels of p53, OGG1 and FOXO1 were significantly di minished in active LN (p<0.01, p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively), whereas in the other patient groups were similar to control group. However, the expres sion of SIRT1 in the urinary sediment had a significant increase (p<0.01) in active group compared to controls. Furthermore, the three patient groups showed an inverse correlation between FOXO1 and OGG1 mRNA levels with antibodies anti dsDNA (r, 0.47 and r, 0.55, p<0.01), and Systemic Lupus Activity Index (SLEDAI) (r, 0.22 and r, 0.41, p<0.05). Whereas urina ry expression of SIRT1 had a direct correlation with anti dsDNA (r,0.87, p<0.001) in active LN. Conclusions: These data show a transcriptional dysregulation in DNA repair enzymes SIRT1 and OGG1, and transcription factor FOXO1 involved in the p53 molecular pathway in SLE patients. In addition, mRNA quantification in the urinary sediment could be a non invasive method to establish its asso ciation with the renal impairment in SLE.",2016
25505,"Introduction: KLF1 is a transcription factor, promoting shift in expression from ÃÂ³ to ÃÂ² globin. This process is carried out either directly, by activating transcription of ÃÂ² gene, or indirectly by activating transcription repressors for silencing ÃÂ³ genes. Variations of KLF1 lead to increased expression of fe tal hemoglobin (Hb F), showing clinical benefits for thalassaemia patients, making it an ideal target for gene intervention to increase HbF levels and thus ameliorating the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype. Material and Methods: This study aimed to identify possible variations of KLF1 gene, in ÃÂ² thalassaemia heterozygotes and normal controls presen ting high levels of HbF>4%. DNA from 47 blood samples was obtained (32 heterozygotes/ 15 normal) and analyzed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of KLF1 gene. Results: An already characterized alteration ( 148G>A) detected for the first time in the Greek population (ÃÂ² thalassemia heterozygote, HbF 19,5%) in coexistence with one published variation of unknown significance (c.544T>C,p. Phe182Leu). Two alternations, not yet recorded (g.1980C>A, c.831A>C), were found in ÃÂ² thalassemia heterozygotes, (HbF: 5,9% and 10,1%) and a frequent polymorphism (c.304T>C,p. Ser102Pro) was present in the majority of tested samples. ÃÂ³ genes investigation prior to this of KLF1 revealed the polymorphism 158C>T (HBG1, Cretan type) for the first time in an Albanian origin sample. Conclusions: KLF1 analysis in a small cohort of samples revealed variations that could possibly contribute in differential HbF expression. More extensi ve analysis of the above gene along with other non globin genes modifying factors of HbF expression has to be conducted especially in ÃÂ² thalassaemia patients in order to unravel the mechanism of Hb F regulation.

25506,"The 15q11.2 q13 region has been well characterized, being associated with a range of syndromatic copy number variants (CNVs), and comprises five established break points sites (BP1 to BP5).While the clinical effect for BP1 BP3, BP2 BP3 and BP4 BP5 CNVs is well established, the same cannot be said for BP1 BP2 CNVs. Recently the 15q11.2 BP1 BP2 deletion has been reviewed, emerging as a microdeletion syndrome with low penetrance and variable expressivity being the CNV frequently inherited from a healthy parent. This microdeleti on is considered to be a risk factor for several neurodevelopment disorders. For the reciprocal duplication the picture has been less conclusive. Aiming for a better understanding of the clinical significance of this CNV, we collected patients with intellectual disability and/or other clinical features, referred for microarray testing, gathering clinical details for the ones with the duplication. Data was collected from two genetic laboratories. With a total of 1545 patients, we identified eleven carrying the duplication at 15q11.2 BP1 BP2. It was possible to assess inheritance in only four cases, all inherited from a healthy parent. All patients presented intellectual disa bility, and facial dysmorphism was the second most common feature obser ved.

25507,"There are many copy number variations (CNVs) that are associated with susceptibility for neurodevelopmental disorders. One such novel CNV is de letion and duplication at chromosome 16p13.11 whose clinical significance is becoming more ascertained. CNVs at 16p13.11 show broad phenotypic manifestations and incomple te penetrance. They are significantly enriched in individuals affected by developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, dysmorphic features and congenital anomalies. Pathogenic 16p13.11 CNVs vary in size, but harbour the critical region called interval II (chr16: 15.48 16.32 Mb, GRCh37/hg19).We investigated the burden of CNVs at 16p13.11 (HumanCytoSNP 12 v2 1 BeadChips; Illumina Inc.) in a sample of 3,212 individuals with a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, clinically referred for chromosomal mi croarray analysis. Cases were compared with 14,747 controls from the Estonian Genome Center. We identified 16 patients with CNV within the 16p13.11 region, representing ~ 0.5 % of the patients analyzed, as compa red to ~ 0.15 % in the Estonian general population. Eight cases were with deletion and eight with duplication in that region, including one prenatally diagnosed case. We found that patients with CNV in 16p13.11 present with varied clinical features as previously described. These features are incompletely pene trant. All deletions and duplications identified encompass the critical region of the CNV. The sizes of the rearrangements vary between 0.3 2.7 Mb. Our findings confirm that genomic abnormalities at chromosome 16p13.11 predispose to a range of neurocognitive and developmental disorders in in dividuals who carry them",2016
25508,"Introduction: The chromosome 1q21.1 locus is a region with a high suscep tibility to recurrent deletions and duplications. These disorders have incom plete penetrance and variable expressivity. Hence the clinical significance of this copy number variation (CNVs) can be difficult to evaluate (from deve lopment delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, autism, psychiatric and behavioural problems to normal phenotype).Materials and Methods: Our laboratory has examined 664 samples by tar geted array comparative genomic hybridization using an (Cytochip ISCATM 8x60 v2.0 Illumina). Samples were received from patients with mental re tardation, epilepsy, autism and/or congenital anomalies. When parental samples were available, the familiar study was performed. Results: We have identified 5 patients with microdeletion and 3 patients with microduplication 1q21.1. One patient with microdeletion was referred for microcephaly and the other 4 patients for developmental abnormalities or mental retardation. In two cases the parents are also affected. We have only one case of parental samples and the deletion was of paternal origin. Two patients with microduplication were referred for epilepsy and the other one by autism. All have macrocephaly. In two cases we have the paren tal samples and the duplication was of maternal origin in both cases. Conclusions: In our group of patients the recurrent 1q21.1 CNV is the most frequent anomaly (1,2 %). The macrocephaly is constant in patients with duplication 1q21.1. The family study is inherited origin in all our studied cases. The clinical variability and the incomplete penetrance make genetic counselling very difficult, especially in prenatal diagnosis.",2016
25509,"Introduction: The 2p15p16.1 microdeletion syndrome has a core phenotype consisting of intellectual disability, microcephaly, hypotonia, delayed grow th, common craniofacial features, and digital anomalies. So far, more than 20 cases with this syndrome have been reported in literature; however, the size of the deletions and their breakpoints vary making the identification of candidate genes challenging. Recent reports pointed to four genes (XPO1, USP34, BCL11A and REL) which were included, alone or in combination, in the smallest deletions causing the syndrome. Results: Herein, we describe 8 new cases with 2p15p16.1 deletion and re view all published cases. We demonstrate functional deficits for the above 4 candidate genes using patient lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs) and knockdown of their orthologs in zebrafish. All genes were dosage sensitive based on re duced protein expression in LCLs. In addition, deletion of XPO1, a nuclear exporter, co segregated with nuclear accumulation of one of its cargo mole cules (rpS5) in patient LCLs. Other pathways associated with these genes (e.g. NF kB and Wnt signaling as well as DNA damage response) were not impaired in patient LCLs. Knockdown of xpo1a, rel , bcl11aa and bcl11ab resulted in abnormal zebrafish embryonic development including microce phaly, dysmorphic body, hindered growth, small fins as well as structural brain abnormalities. Conclusions: Our multifaceted analysis strongly implicates XPO1, REL, and BCL11A as candidate genes for the 2p15p16.1 microdeletion syndrome.",2016
25510,"Microdeletion of 2q31 involving the HOXD gene cluster is a rare syndrome. The deletion of the HOXD gene cluster is thought to result in skeletal ano malies in these patients. HOX genes encode highly conserved transcription factors that control cell fate and the regional identities along the primary body and limb axes. Several patients with this syndrome have neurological manifestations. We experienced a new patient with 2q31 microdeletion en compassing the HOXD gene cluster and some neighboring genes including the ZNF385B. The patient showed digital anomalies, growth failure, epilep tic seizures, and severe intellectual disability. MRI showed delayed myelina tion and a low signal intensity in the bilateral basal ganglia. Abnormal MRI findings in the 2q31.1 microdeletion syndrome have been reported in some other patients. They were also haploinsufficient for ZNF385B. The ZNF385B is a zinc finger protein expressed in brain. We suggest that haploinsufficien cy of ZNF385B is responsible for the neurological features of this syndrome.",2016

Some facial features are characteristic for the syndrome (i.e. round face, frontal bossing, arched eyebrows, deep set eyes, upslanted palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, thin upper lip, minor ear anomalies). Haploinsufficiency of HDAC4 seems to be the most critical for the phenotypic spectrum. Here, we have attempted to assess chromosome ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

Molecular karyotyping by SNP/oligonucleotide mi croarray (resolution: >1kbp) was used to analyze 300 children with ID, au tism spectrum disorders and congenital malformations. Results. Cytogenetically visible 2q37 deletions were detected in 2 cases. Molecular karyotyping confirmed the presence of these deletions (5Mb and 8.5Mb). Furthermore, a CNV within 2q37.3 (44kbp) leading to HDAC4 loss was detected in a patient. All affected female patients had ID, autism and minor ear anomalies. One had widely set nipples and hypotonia. Another one had a short statue. Two patients presented with ocular hypertelorism. HDAC4 haploinsufficiency was observed in all three cases. Conclusions. We show that 2q37 deletions can be common in children with ID, autism, congenital malformations tending to a frequency as high as 1%. Therefore, one can suggest that 2q37.3 deletions are likely to be more com mon among these children than previously recognized.

25512,"Duplications involving the short arm of chromosome 7 are rare events, and most occur in association with rearrangements of other chromosomes as a consequence of missegregation of a balanced translocation in a carrier pro genitor. The majority of the patients described have a 7p terminal duplicati on in association with other imbalance, making 7p interstitial duplications even more rare events. The ones described have variable sizes, usually with cytogenetically visible imbalances, with few characterized by array Compa rative Genomic Hybridization. Here we report a 12 year old male with global developmental delay, facial dysmorphisms, hypotonia and epilepsy that was analyzed by Agilent 180K oligonucleotide array CGH, with an average probe spacing of 17Kb. The analysis revealed a 5.5 Mb interstitial duplication in chromosome 7p21.2p21.1(14,624,128 20187,355)[hg19].Common to all reported patients with 7p duplications is the presence of in tellectual disability and variable facial dysmorphisms, while manifestations like cardiac anomalies, skeletal anomalies and hypotonia are present only in some of the patients. The reported patient is the third reported with autism, after the report of a 7p21.1p22.2 de novo duplication, larger but overlap ping the one reported, and a 7p11.2p14.1 proximal duplication. This is the first report of a 7p21 interstitial duplication associated with epilepsy. Establishing the exact boundaries of 7p pure interstitial duplications, iden tifying the genes involved and their functional characterization might lead to pinpoint candidate genes responsible for specific manifestations.

25513,"Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array CGH) has increased the diagnostic yield in patients with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and multiple congenital anomalies due to its improved re solution. The short arm of chromosome 8 (8p) is structurally complex be cause of the existence of two olfactory gene clusters flanking a 5Mb region of 8p23.1, several low copy repeats (LCRs) and common inversion polymor phisms that makes this region prone to various recurrent genomic rearran gements that include: 8p23.1 deletions or duplications, 8p23.1 paracentric inversions, pericentric inversions, 8p translocations, 8p inverted duplicati on with associated terminal deletion, among others. In addition to these 8p pathogenic imbalances, others have been reported as copy number variants (CNVs) without apparent clinical significance. In our cohort of 1500 pati ents, with ID and/or ASD studied by Agilent 180K oligonucleotide array CGH, we have detected 14 patients with 8p imbalances (5 deletions, 8 dupli cations and one inverted duplication).

25514,"Heterozygous loss of function mutations in the activity dependent neuro protector homeobox gene ADNP , which encodes a transcription factor in volved in the SWI/SNF remodelling complex, were recently shown to be as sociated with moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID). Additional cli nical abnormalities which included short stature, muscular hypotonia and facial dysmorphisms had enabled the delineation of a new entity termed Helsmoortel van der Aa syndrome (OMIM 615873). Since its first report in 2014, studies in large ID cohorts identified mutations in 14 unrelated pati ents, suggesting that ADNP mutations are a comparatively frequent cause of autosomal dominant ID. We report on three unrelated German patients (two boys and one girl) in whom ADNP mutations were detected by next generation sequencing. Cli nical problems that are in accordance with those of previously reported patients included severe ID, muscular hypotonia, short stature and hypopla stic corpus callosum. Borderline microcephaly, which had so far only been reported in a minority of patients, was present in two of our patients. One patient had unilateral iris coloboma, which has hitherto not been reported in association with ADNP mutations. Our findings corroborate the assumption that ADNP mutations are one of the more frequent causes of ID in sporadic patients, and they expand the clinical spectrum of the probably underdiagnosed Helsmoortel van der Aa syndrome.",2016
25515,"Introduction: Copy Number Variations (CNV) are known to underlie several diseases such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and schi zophrenia. It is also well known that CNVs play important roles in microde letion syndromes. Several methods were developed to detect CNVs. One of these methods, array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH), is now the recommended first tier test for molecular diagnosis in patients with cognitive disorders. aCGH detects genome wide CNVs, however, findings should be validated. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify CNVs detected by aCGH in patients with cognitive disorders,.Materials and methods: aCGH (AgilentÃÂ® 8x60K) analyses for 150 patients with cognitive disorders detected 19 CNVs either of unknown clinical si gnificance or of likely pathogenicity. Afterwards, these CNVs were verified by SYBR Green based quantitative PCR (qPCR).Results: Verification was done in 18 CNVs. Of these, 4 CNVs turned out to be false positives. Two CNVs were de novo. Clinical correlation of the CNVs revealed that these 16 CNVs were among the already known microdeleti on and/or microduplication syndromes. In order to draw attention to the importance of verification, two patients will be presented: One with a con firmed and paternally inherited deletion at 2q37, and the other with a false positive duplication at 1q21.3.Conclusion: The current study has shown that CNVs detected by aCGH ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

25516,"Successful application of arrayCGH to prenatal and postnatal genetic dia gnosis led to a significant increase in the detection rate of chromosomal ab normalities. Here, we reflect on our 5 year experience (2011 to 2015) with the implementation of arrayCGH. Different array platforms were used with increasing probe density and, since 2013, included SNPs to investigate patients whose phenotype was consistent with an imprinting disorder or an autosomal recessive disorder caused by autozygosity. We examined 1414 patients belonging to 1261 fa milies (95 prenatally, 1319 postnatally), who were referred mostly for intel lectual disability, autism and/or congenital abnormalities. In 10/95 (11%) prenatal and in 365/1319 (28%) postnatal cases we identi fied possibly relevant copy number variations (CNV) or regions of absence of heterozygosity (AOH). Overall there were 1125 relevant CNVs that required further investigation originating 468 reportable CNVs (203 deletions, 265 duplications), ranging in size from 43kb (intragenic deletion of MBD5 ) to 154Mb (X aneuploidy). After segregation analysis and/or confirmatory tests, 266 variants were classified as pathogenic and 202 as of uncertain clinical significance. We also detected an AOH containing a gene associated with Bardet Biedl syndrome, consistent with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype, and a case of partial UPD(14).Large size rearrangements can be benign and, conversely, very small size CNVs may be pathogenic. The global analysis of our array database suggests a postnatal cut off of 30kb and, for prenatal reporting, a 150kb cut off for deletions and a 200kb for duplications. However, we recommend analyzing each case on an individual basis and in close connection with the clinicians.",2016

Both are normocephalic, brain MRI demon strated mild cortical atrophy in the older brother only. Lactate, ammonia, Acyl carnitine, liver function and lipid profile were normal. Whole Exome sequencing of the affected siblings, both parents and two un affected sisters revealed only one variant that was homozygous in both af fected children, heterozygous in the sisters: ARV1 p.

Arv1 / mice exhibit a dramatic lean phenotype. In mammalian cells, Arv1 is required for normal choleste rol, bile acid and triglyceride homeostasis, its knockdown increases lipid mediated cell death.

Who le exome sequencing was performed to depict the complex genetics autism spectrum disorder. Material and methods: Exome sequencing and selective analysis of ASD known genes was applied at first. Then a second analysis extended to re maining OMIM genes was carried out (qGenomics Laboratory) Results: ASD related genes analysis did not reveal any significant finding, but the extended study to other OMIM genes identified a likely pathogenic mutation in GDI1 gene (c.389 1G> C; hemizygous splicing variant). This gene has been strongly associated with intellectual disabilities (ID) although there is only evidence from 3 published families with X linked ID and GDI1 mutations (one nonsense, two missense) (Strobl Wildemann G, et al. Am J Med Genet A. 2011). Conclusions: The mutation found in the studied family provides more evi dence about the GDI1 role in X linked ID. Furthermore, GDI1 seems to be related also to another clinical feature, ASD. Our findings suggest including GDI1 in ASD panels as well as in X linked intellectual disabilities. Finally, our work underlines the utility of whole exome sequencing instead of specific gene panels for an accurate diagnosis and complete genetic counselling.",2016
25519,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are clinical ly and genetically heterogeneous diseases. Recent whole exome sequencing studies indicated that genes associated with different neurologic disorders are shared among these disorders or converge on common functional pa thways. The aim of this study was to design a customized multiplex PCR based gene panel to investigate the genetic bases of ID and ASD comorbidity. The gene panel covers 74 genes, including a subset of genes that are found recurrently mutated in ID or ASD conditions, genes shared among ID and ASD disease network and ID/ASD genes that are directly connected to these. We analy zed 18 clinically selected patients with ID and ASD without syndromic fea tures, negative for Fragile X test and array CGH. For all 18 patients, 85 97% of the targeted regions achieved read depths of at least 20x, with average read depths ranging from 91x to 612x. 22 rare single nucleotide variants (SNV) were found in the exonic sequences of 16 out of the 18 patients: most of them are predicted to be deleterious and have very low frequency or are no present in public databases. Although familial segregation analysis will be helpful to determine the pathogenic nature of the variants, likely causa tive variants have been assigned for 8 (44%) of the patients. These results confirm the diagnostic value of the targeted gene panel for investigating children with ID and ASD. Funding: Italian Ministry of health Young Investigator Grant GR 2011 02347754 to E.

Materials and Methods: We compared 17 patientsÃ¢ÂÂ trio WES yield with the retrospective costs of diagnostic procedures by comprehensively examining patient records and collecting resource use information for each patient, be ginning with patient admittance and concluding with WES initiation. We cal culated cost savings using scenario analyses to evaluate the costs replaced by WES when used as a first diagnostic tool. Results: WES resulted in diagnostically useful outcomes in 29.4% of pati ents. The entire traditional diagnostic trajectory average cost was $16,409 per patient, substantially higher than the $3,972 trio WES cost.

Biallelic aberrations in this gene are causative for an autosomal recessive disorder with epilepsy, severe intellectual disa bility (ID) and cortical dysplasia (CDFES), however, due to the limited num ber of reported individuals, the full mutational and clinical spectrum has still to be characterized. Methods and Results: Targeted sequencing, chromosomal microarray analy sis or multi gene panel sequencing identified homozygous mutations, com pound heterozygous CNVs or compound heterozygous CNVs and mutations in eight individuals from six unrelated families. All aberrations were inheri ted from healthy, heterozygous parents and are predicted to be deleterious for protein function. Epilepsy occurred in all patients with onset in the first three and a half years of life. Further common aspects were severe ID (7/8), regression of speech development (5/8), and behavioural anomalies (7/8). Interestingly, cognitive impairment in one of two affected brothers was in comparison relatively mild with good speech and simple writing abilities. Cortical dysplasia that was previously reported in CDFES, was not present in MRIs of six individuals and only suspected in one.

25523,"Coffin Lowry syndrome (CLS) is a rare X linked semi dominant mental re tardation syndrome, in males characterized by severe intellectual disability, growth retardation, distinct facial features and progressive kyphoscoliosis. In females, the phenotype is less explicit and ranges from the full pheno type as seen in males, to completely absent. The diagnosis in females can be challenging. Furthermore, data on the natural history in affected females is still scarce. We describe a familial case of CLS with two affected adult females and no affected males. The molecular analysis of the RPS6KA3 gene revealed a he terozygous frameshift mutation in exon 11, once previously reported in the literature. Both sisters presented well known features of CLS: intellectual ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 160Back to index disability, facial dysmorphic features and soft, fleshy hands. Both females were affected by a psychiatric disorder, including psychotic disorder and depression. Interestingly, there was a strongly intrafamilial variability in the severity of psychiatric disease and psychosocial functioning. Both parents were asymptomatic. The genetic testing to determine whether the mother is an asymptomatic carrier is ongoing. To our knowledge this is one of the very few families with affected females only. This case demonstrates the variability of clinical phenotype and natu ral history of CLS in adult females. Furthermore, we illustrate the challenges of treatment of a psychiatric disorder in females with CLS. akattentidt@gmail.com",2016
25524,"Corpus callosum agenesis (CCA) corresponds to complete or partial ab sence of the corpus callosum, the main brain structure connecting the two hemispheres, and is the most frequent brain malformation in humans. CCA is usually diagnosed antenatally, and prenatal counseling is therefore a crucial issue, especially in apparently isolated CCA. To determine the type and frequency of genetic anomalies and to identify new genes involved in CCA, we recruited prospectively a cohort of 150 patients with CCA and in tellectual disability (ID), and several families with CCA without ID. Clinical examination has allowed establishing a diagnosis for 10 patients, whereas a chromosomal abnormality was identified in 20 patients. Next, we have sequenced 423 candidate genes selected for their known or putative asso ciation with CCA in humans (345) or mouse models (79) in 100 probands. A pathogenic mutation was identified in 18 patients in 8 different genes (ARID1B, ZBTB18, TUBA1A, FOXG1, SPTAN1, ARX, MED12, DYNC1H1). In addition, we have sequenced the exome of 5 trios, 4 sib pairs, and 3 families with CCA without ID segregating as a dominantly inherited trait. Our results show that next generation sequencing approaches are powerful diagnostic tools for CCA and confirm the large genetic heterogeneity of this condition, in which many genes are still unknown. Moreover, the identification of ge nes involved in CCA without ID will change the paradigm of prenatal genetic counseling.",2016
25525,"Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a powerful tool for de tecting relative small genomic imbalances. Here we report on the design and potential of a targeted aCGH for the evaluation of patients with neurodeve lopmental disorders. An array was designed on AgilentÃ¢ÂÂs SureDesign web application in 8X60K format, covering 6,803 genes, with a probe spacing of 0.66 20 kb. Overall 39 patients were analyzed and 479 genes had aberrant copy number (CNV). These genes were screened by an algorithm for brain specific gene expression (publically available data). Expression heat maps were found for 316 genes: 93 were below the expression threshold of 5.5, 134 had expres sion level up to 9, and 86 had high expression level up to 13, respectively. Comparing custom array with commercially available Agilent 8X60K plat forms, the custom one is superior in terms of numbers of specific genes co vered. Furthermore, comparing the resolution of arrays (33 kb SurePrint 3G, 60 kb ISCA), our design has much higher average resolution of 8.2 kb and therefore has a capability to detect smaller CNVs. Considering that our cu stom array was able to detected imbalances in 220 genes that are expressed in brain, the design presented showed to be a powerful tool for detecting genomic imbalances in genes that are involved in neurodevelopmental dis orders. This preliminary data are strong indications that implementation of targeted custom aCGH in research may reveal new candidate genes under lying neurodevelopmental disorders.

Epilepsy represents a major clinical challenge during early years in WHS, with significant impact on quality of life. The main aim of this work it will be to describe social, demographic and clinical features of a cohort of WHS in Spain trying to esta blish whether or not the level of psychomotor development in this cohort correlates with size of the deletion and other clinical features. Methods: Using high resolution SNP array, we finely mapped CNVs in around 40 individuals with WHS. Seizure and other phenotypes data were collected through a comprehensive questionnaire supplemented with avai lable medical records, and statically analyzed. Results: We show a complete description of a cohort of WHS in our coun try. Although main clinical features were similar to other previous studies, our cohort showed a better degree of psychomotor development than other ones. In fact, seizures in this cohort were preferentially under a febrile con text (91%), and related to communication skills; more than 60% was able to communicate (non verbal), 46% say words, and 27% to make short sen tences, in a context that positively correlates with shorter deletions. Conclusions: We founded a direct correlationship between size of the deleti on, severity of the epilepsy and the level of psychomotor development delay. Our preliminary results suggested that epilepsy in WHS may be a complex event and may it involve the synergistic effects of loss of two or more genes. Granted by Endoscreen S2011/BMD 2396",2016

Exome trio analysis is a very effective strategy to identify de novo, hemizygous, newly homozygous and in compound heterozygous potentially causal variants of rare genetic disorders. Methods: We performed exome sequencing using Ion AmpliSeqTM Exome RDY technology (Life Technologies) with Ion ProtonTM and Ion S5 XLTM. Sequencing reads were analysed using Torrent Suite software. Trio annota ted variants using ION Reporter were prioritized with an in house analytical pipeline to identify causative genetic variants. Results: We present the analysis of the first 130 trios referred to NIMGe netics. Patients were mainly children with syndromic intellectual disabili ty (55%). The genetic etiology was potentially elucidated in 55 probands harboring 38 causal variants and 22 likely causative variants, achieving a 43% molecular diagnostic rate. Among these patients, 36 harbored de novo variants, 6 hemizygous maternally inherited variants, 4 in compound hete rozygous variants, 7 newly homozygous variants and 3 variants inherited from parents.

Deletions and point mutations are detected in less than 1% of patients. Deletions affecting single exons or the entire FMR1 gene arise eit her de novo, are transmitted from mothers carriers of the same deletion, or derive from a maternal pre or full mutation allele. We report on the transmission of a mutant FMR1 allele from a premutati on carrier mother to her two children. The healthy mother is carrier of an FMR1 allele with an expansion in the premutation range (approximately 84 CGG repeats). A deletion of the entire exon 1 was detected in her 2 year old son diagnosed with fragile X syndrome. The analyses were based on a RP PCR and a methylation sensitive MLPA assay, including CNV analysis. A prenatal investigation for her daughter showed that she is carrier of a full mutation with approximately 285 CGG repeats. This latter analysis was per formed on chorionic villi using RP PCR.

We performed systematic stati stical analysis and genotype phenotype correlation in patients with FOXG1 syndrome based on the molecular and clinical data of a total of 83 patients with a point mutation in FOXG1. Our analysis shows a higher phenotypic variability than expected. The most characteristic clinical features in pati ents with a FOXG1 mutation are: (1) severe microcephaly, including primary microcephaly, (2) short stature, (3) moderate to severe psychomotor delay, with some patients achieving unsupported walking and speech, (4) preser vation of social interaction, (5) frequent neurological abnormalities inclu ding hypotonia, stereotypies, dyskinesia, strabism, bruxism, and spasticity, (6) variable forms of epilepsy, (7) abnormal sleep pattern, (8) gastrointesti nal features, (9) development of scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis, and (10 ) brain anomalies. Our results show a correlation between location and coding ef fect of the FOXG1 mutation.

25530,"Introduction: Intellectual disability (ID) and specific language impairment (SLI) cover a wide range of conditions with heterogeneous phenotypes and etiologies, making them challenging for clinical geneticists. Mutations in forkhead box protein P1 (FOXP1), a transcription regulator, are associated with ID and SLI, with or without autistic features (MIM: 613670). Multiple FOXP1 patients have been described, though so far, no specific phenotype emerged. Materials and Methods: We report on the clinical and molecular data of 21 novel and well characterized patients with FOXP1 mutations and review the 25 previously reported FOXP1 patients to delineate the condition. Results: Phenotypic analysis shows a combination of neuromotor delay, ID, SLI, and typical facial features including a high broad forehead, bent downs lanting palpebral fissures, ptosis, blepharophimosis, and a short nose with bulbous tip. Relative macrocephaly, strabismus, a wide mouth with down turned corners, and pronounced nasolabial folds appear more variable. Behavioural problems and autistic features are common. Brain, cardiac and urogenital malformations seem associated. Molecular data show de novo mutations in all cases, either monogenic or part of a more extended intersti tial 3p deletions. Subgroup analysis reveals sensorineural hearing loss and more severe ID in patients with interstitial 3p deletions. Conclusions: FOXP1 related ID syndrome is a recognizable entity that seems more frequent than expected. We expand the phenotypic description with typical facial features and associated organ system involvements. This will enable clinicians to make a gestalt diagnosis and will be helpful to evaluate genotype phenotype correlations when interpreting large NGS data obtai ned in patients with ID and/or SLI.",2016
25531,"Background and aims: FOXP1 is a member of the Forhead Box P (FOXP) sub family of transcription factors, which also includes FOXP2. Disruptions of FOXP2, the closest relative to FOXP1, have been involved in the etiology of familial verbal dyspraxia. In the last few years, 11 individuals with FOXP1 variants have been repor ted, supporting the implication of this gene in the pathogenesis of human cognitive disorders including language impairment. These patients show autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, global developmental de lay and moderate to severe speech delay. We report on three new individuals with de novo FOXP1 variants showing features that are consistent with this new clinical entity (MIM 613670).Method: Whole genome aCGH was carried out in patients 1 and 2 using a custom designed 60K oligonucleotide array (KaryoArrayÃÂ®v3.0).Whole exome sequencing was performed as a trio in patient 3 to identify de novo mutations related to the phenotype after a normal result using aCGH.

25532,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) continues to facilitate the genetic diagnosis of patients with intellectual disability (ID). Sensitive methods exist for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels less than 20bp in size. However, the discovery of long indels 20 200bp in size, remains challenging even in non repetitive regions of the genome such as exons. As a result the role of small deletions (long indels) is currently unknown and under reported in many studies. We analysed the WES data from 98 patients with ID to identify pathogenic long indels located in exons of 650 ID genes using Pindel and Platypus. All patients had previously screened negative for WES based SNV, small indel and large copy number variants. To assess the sensitivity of the calling algo rithms we compared variants discovered in the patient cohort to 35 exonic indels described in the Genome of the Netherlands dataset with an allele frequency greater than 5%, 20 200bp in size. We were able to detect 74% (n,26) of common exonic indels, serving as an estimated detection sensitivity. Further analysis of the rare variants within the patient cohort identified two indels predicted to explain the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ clinical syndrome (diagnostic yield 2%). A 42bp homozygous deletion of exon intron border in PGAP3 gene, and a 114bp heterozygous complex in del disrupting the MECP2 gene. Despite the fragmented nature and short read length of WES data, using specific software tools for long indel detection increases diagnostic yield in patients with ID.

Our patient presented with intelectual disability, behavioural abnormality and dysmorphic features, Whole genome oligonucleotide mi croarray (PerkinElmer CGXTM HD 4x180K Oligo Array) analysis revealed a 2.41 Mb duplication on chromosome 16p13.3 (chr16:788,264 3,203,164; hg19) encompassing 124 genes (including 71 OMIM genes) as well as the critical regions for alpha thalassemia with intellectual disability (AT ID), tu berous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), and polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1). FISH stu dies in both parents gave normal results, proving the de novo occurrence of this aberration in the child. According to the literature, 16p13.3 duplication consists of a contiguous gene syndrome with variable phenotypic expressi on, and CREBBP is the critical gene responsible for the main clinical features of 16p13.3 microduplication. To date, there is no evidence of other genes in this region contributing to the phenotype. It is suggested that other genes play additive or modulator role justifying some of the features found in in dividuals with dup 16p13.3.In the presented girl, the 16p13.3 duplication is responsible for the clinical phenotype, although it does not include the CREBBP gene.

25534,"Syndromic or non syndromic intellectual disability (ID) has multiple un derlying etiologies including in particular monogenic rare disease. Most of these causes are currently unknown. In the last five years, the development of whole exome sequencing (WES) has lead to identify many new genes re sponsible of ID. Using WES we identified the same de novo missense hete rozygous mutation (p. Glu209Lys) in the PACS2 gene in two patients pre senting with moderate ID, neonatal seizures and similar recognizable facial dysmorphism (bulbous nasal tip, wide mouth, thin upper lip and everted lower lip). A moderate neutropenia is observed in one of them. This mutati on involves a highly conserved amino acid in an acid domain constituted by ramified amino acids, leading to possible polarity and protein conformation changes. The PACS2 gene encodes for a protein mainly expressed in brain, heart, kidney, pancreas and testis. PACS2 is involved in controlling the ex changes between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, in ER homeostasis and in apoptosis induction. Cellular studies have demonstra ted that PACS2 knockout would lead to ER dissociation and mitochondria fragmentation, as well as a defect in tBid mediated apoptosis. PACS2 is also a paralog to PACS1 (54% of identical sequence) previously reported in a hu man disorder characterized by ID. These data allow considering PACS2 as a new gene responsible for ID with recognizable facial features.

In an attempt to further characterise very rare emerging CNV syndromes we undertook genome wide chromosomal microarray analysis and comprehen sive psychiatric phenotyping of adults with idiopathic ID recruited from ID psychiatry services across England. Of the 202 adults recruited to the study 11% had CNVs classed as likely pa thogenic by the clinical diagnostic laboratory. These included a 1.7Mb de letion at 2q13 and a 2.4Mb duplication at 4p16.3, both of which are poorly characterised in adulthood. We undertook further targeted recruitment of children and adults with CNVs in these regions to expand the phenotypic data on these emerging pathological CNVs. Study of adults with idiopathic ID and psychiatric disorders has enabled the phenotypic characterisation of two CNVs associated with co morbid patho logies.

25536," Two families with members displaying substantial motor impairment, mild intellectual disability and periventricular white matter abnormalities on cerebral MRI were referred to our department. Four affected siblings in family 1 had been thoroughly investigated for neuromuscular disorders, including mitochondrial disease. Two siblings in family 2 were previously diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis due to cerebral MRI abnormalities. A trio from each family was analysed using the Trusight One sequencing panel, targeting 4813 disease associated genes on an Illumina MiSeq platform. All six patients (10 31 years old) were homozygous for a splice site mutation c.1320+1G>A in ABCC9. ABCC9 encodes sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2), which is a regulatory subunit of the K ATP sensitive potassium (KATP) channel. These SUR2 containing KATP channels are enriched in the sarco lemma, where they sense intracellular ADP content and trigger the opening or closing of potassium channels. These channels are critical in cells during periods of high energy demand. The outcome ABCC9 of the c.1320+1G>A variant is an in frame deletion (r.1165_1320del) resulting (if translated) in a SUR2 protein lacking 52 amino acids (p. Ala389_Gln440del). This com promised SUR2 protein might explain some of the clinical findings in these patients. Whereas heterozygous mutations in ABCC9 are known to cause Cantu syndrome (hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia, OMIM#239850), we speculate if the homozygous mutation identified in these two families may cause a new, distinct syndrome.",2016
25537,"Intellectual disability (ID) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder cha racterized by an extreme genetic heterogeneity with more than five hundred genes now described as implicated in mendelian forms. We performed exo me sequencing in a large family with five affected individuals presenting with mild ID, ptosis, growth retardation and hypotonia with a suspected autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. We identified a 2 bp deletion causing a frameshift in BRPF1, a gene not yet implicated in ID. The muta ted transcript is expressed in fibroblasts and leads to a truncated protein. The BRPF1 protein activates two histone acetyltransferases (KAT6A and KAT6B) causing syndromic ID in human when mutated. We have therefore investigated how the truncation can affect BRPF1 interaction with its part ners KAT6A and KAT6B, as well as its histone H3 binding ability. BRPF1 is located in the 3p25 region, involved in a deletion syndrome characterized by ID with additional features, and presumably due to the loss of the SETD5 gene. The identification of a truncating mutation in the BRPF1 gene perfect ly cosegregating with ID in one large family with phenotype overlapping the 3p25 deletion syndrome suggests that BRPF1 might also participate to the cognitive and dysmorphic phenotype of this syndrome, and especially pto sis, hypotonia, and growth retardation, as these clinical features are present in patients with 3p25 deletion only when BRPF1 is included.

Additional patients with de novo mutations in YY1 were collected through targeted re sequencing of YY1, further exome sequencing studies, and through Gene Matcher2 and Decipher3. In total, eight patients with de novo mutations in YY1 (four mis sense and four truncating mutations) and three patients with small deleti ons encompassing YY1 were identified. All patients showed below average IQ that ranged from moderate ID to mild learning problems. Other recur rently observed features included intrauterine growth retardation, feeding problems, behavioral problems, and dystonia. In four patients, typical facial dysmorphisms were present: facial asymmetry with a broad forehead, full ness of the upper eyelids, and a Gingko leaf like shape of the upper lip. To gain insight into the effects of YY1 mutations on downstream signaling, we profiled lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with mutations and deleti ons of YY1 through RNA seq and ChIP seq for YY1 and enhancer chromatin marks. In conclusion, we show that de novo mutations in the transcription factor YY1 are recurrently observed in patients with ID, and we present a characterization of the main gene network nodes affected by YY1 mutations and deletions.

Purpose: Our goal was to determine the efficiency of exome sequencing to unravel the molecular cause of ID in patients with severe phenotype seen by clinical geneticists from Western France hospitals. Method: Following a trio based exome sequencing strategy, we investigated 75 patients with severe ID which could not been explained by fragile X syn drome, copy number variations (CGH array) or even by known candidate genes. Results: For almost 50% of the cases tested so far, we have been able to ex plain the molecular cause of the disease or highlight new ID candidate genes.

Va riable features comprised ocular coloboma, joint laxity and/or dislocation, vertebral anomalies, branchial anomalies, cardiac, and renal defects. To date, a unique patient has been reported with a de novo probably patho genic mutation in PUF60 (p. His169Tyr) associated with DD, microcepha ly, craniofacial and cardiac defects. We report on three additional patients carrying a de novo heterozygous mutation in PUF60 identified by whole exome sequencing (WES), including a splice site mutation (c.24+1G>C), a nonsense (p.

We sequenced 151 index cases with the Illumina TruSight One panel which targets the coding sequences of 4813 genes involved in human pathology. Our aim was a diagnostic yield close to exome sequencing but less expensi ve. All patients had a negative diagnostic work up before sequencing inclu ding chromosome microarray analysis. A definitive or likely diagnosis was found for 42 index cases (28%) in 39 different genes: 30 were autosomal dominant (de novo or with a low mo saicism in one parent), 6 were autosomal recessive, 6 were X linked. We also made 4 partial diagnoses which do not explain the whole phenotype. Besi des, 10 variants were classified as variants of unknown significance. Finally, we identified 7 incidental findings irrelevant with the indication. In our series, 56 patients had autism and ID with normal motor develop ment and autistic regression. In these patients, we achieved a unique dia gnosis (1.7%); therefore our diagnostic yield was 42% among our 95 pati ents with ID and no autism. We had also 35% diagnoses in our 40 patients with ID and epilepsy. Overall, this technique provides a significant advance in the diagnostic strat egy of patients with ID. However, it highlights the need to better characterize its clinical indications. Mostly, our experience suggests that ID as part of an autistic syndrome is currently not a good indication due to the supposed multifactorial nature of this pathology.

Among the 1200 genes of the X chromosome, 115 of them so far are X linked intellectual disability genes (X LID). PQBP1gene is well known to be involved in syndromic and non syndromic X LID. Here we report a French family with 5 affected males who showed severe to mild intellectual disability associated with developmental delay.

This mutation was inherited by all the affected relatives. The mo thers and the grandmother have been found heterozygous for the mutation. Material and methods: NGS for XLID was performed for 2 patients using SO LiD 5500 sequencer (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Sorting and calling of SNP/InDel were performed using SAMTOOL and GATK software. All sequence variants were prioritized by scoring phylogenetic conservation and functional impact (SIFT and Polyphen 2). Candidate variants were con firmed by Sanger sequencing.

25544,"Introduction: Primary microcephaly is an important clinical symptom as sociated with various genetic disorders and can be found isolated or as one of the features of a syndrome. Microcephaly and intellectual disability usu ally present together and more than 300 OMIM entries are described with the coexistence of these two features. In this report we describe a patient with microcephaly, deficiency of speech development, delayed motor skills, seizures and a homozygous RTTN gene mutation. Materials and Methods: Cranial MRI, EEG, echocardiography, abdominal USG, visual evoked potential (VEP) and brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) tests were performed. Karyotyping, FISH analysis and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed. Results: The index patient was 9 years and presented with primary micro cephaly, developmental delay, recurrent seizures, and intellectual disability. Cranial MRI showed pachygyria, neuronal migration anomaly and cerebro cerebellar atrophy. EEG showed frontotemporal epilepsy. Echocardiogra phy, abdominal ultrasonography, VEP and BAER tests were normal. The patient had normal karyotype and FISH analysis for Prader Willi/Angel man Syndrome. WES analysis revealed a causative homozygous missense (c.2796A>T) RTTN gene mutation. Conclusions: RTTN gene encodes rotatin protein which is localized at the cil iary basal bodies. In mice, rotation protein defects result in abnormal axial rotation and neural tube differentiation. Even though specific functions in human are still unknown, it is suggested that rotatin has similar effects on the development of the neural tube and the notochord. Since clinical vari ability in patients carrying autosomal recessive RTTN mutations has been described, it is important to further define the clinical spectrum of RTTN associated disorders.",2016
25545,"Introduction: Mutations in the STXBP1 gene were first described to cause Ohtahara syndrome (Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, EIEE) charac terized by very early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with frequent tonic spasms and a suppression burst pattern on electroencephalogram. In the following years a wider phenotype was recognized having milder forms of epilepsies. Material and Methods: More than 150 patients with intellectual disability (ID) and movement disorders, in whom genomic imbalances and fragile X syndrome had been excluded, were screened for exonic variants using the TruSight One enrichment panel (Illumina). Results: Here, we present three female patients with an ataxia tremor re tardation syndrome caused by a de novo dominant STXBP1 mutation. Two of the girls were diagnosed through next generation sequencing as mutations in STXBP1 were not suspected. The third patient was diagnosed by targeted genetic testing due to its clinical features strikingly similar to the first two girls. All patients showed intellectual disability and movement disorders. Additional behavioral disturbances such as hyperactivity, stereotypic beha vior, hand biting and hyperventilation burst were also recognized in affected patients with STXBP1 mutations Conclusion: In summary, the characteristic feature of our three patients is the lack of epilepsy which is in contrast to the majority of the patients. Hence, epilepsy is not a mandatory feature of patients with a STXBP1 mu tation.",2016
25546,"Introduction: The direct implication of several X linked genes in XLID has been questioned, mainly due to the lack of replication of the particular fin ding and to inherent difficulties in validating de novo variants. We present the identification of a microdeletion encompassing the SHROOM4 gene, detected through whole exome sequencing in a large Greek kindred with syndromic XLID, thus establishing the involvement of SHROOM4 in Stocco dos Santos Syndrome and syndromic XLID. Materials and Methods: A 45 yr old male, presenting with mild dysmor phic features, kyphosis, short stature, moderate intellectual disability and with four other similarly affected male relatives, was referred for genetic testing. Common genetic causes had been previously excluded. Whole exo me sequencing (WES) was performed on an Ion Proton PI chip, followed by variant prioritization utilizing a custom analysis pipeline, including CNV detection through a modified coverage analysis plug in. Results: Combined analysis of WES data from the proband revealed a high ly probable deletion of the Xp11.22 chromosomal region, approximately 1,85Mb in size encompassing OMIM genes SHROOM4 and BMP15. Subse quent aCGH analysis confirmed the presence of the microdeletion in 3 other similarly affected males in the family and the expected maternal segregation in the kindred. Conclusions: The findings presented herein provide important evidence confirming, the hitherto debatable, involvement of the SHROOM4 gene in syndromic XLID and its association with Stocco dos Santos syndrome. Fur thermore, the employed data analysis pipeline illustrates the power of WES analyses for the detection of constitutional CNVÃ¢ÂÂs, particularly those asso ciated with X linked genetic disorders.

25547,"Introduction: The IQSEC2 is known to have a significant role in cytoskeletal organization, dendritic spine morphology and synaptic organization. Material and Methods: We studied a non consanguineous family with five affected individuals with unexplained mild to severe ID and one with lear ning disabilities, studied by next generation sequencing. Results: Here we report on the first splicing variant in IQSEC2 (g.88032_88033del; NG_021296.1) that co segregates in a family diagnosed with an X linked form of ID. In a percentage of the cells, the variant activates an intraexonic splice acceptor site that abolishes 26 amino acids from the highly conserved PH domain of IQSEC2 and creates a premature stop codon 36 amino acids later in exon 13. Interestingly, the percentage of aberrant splicing seems to correlate with the severity of the disease in each patient. The impact of this variant in the target tissue is unknown, but we can hy pothesize that these differences may be related to the amount of abnormal IQSEC2 transcript. Conclusions: To our knowledge, we are reporting a novel mechanism of IQSEC2 involvement in ID. Variants that affect splicing are related to many genetic diseases and the understanding of their role in disease expands potential opportunities for gene therapy. Modulation of aberrant splicing transcripts can become a potent therapeutic approach for many of these diseases.

25548,"Introduction: Kabuki syndrome is a rare genetic disease involving multiple malformations, intellectual deficiency and a distinctive facial phenotype. Ge netic transmission of Kabuki syndrome is mainly autosomal dominant with an estimated incidence of 1 in 32,000 births. In most cases, a KMT2D point mutation is responsible of the syndrome. Materials and Methods: A large cohort of French Kabuki patients was collec ted. For each of them, a previous clinical assessment was performed and 260 probands with a high confidence were selected. KMT2D analysis was done by Sanger sequencing. Highlighted variants were scored into a 5 categories classification of pathogenicity based on scientific literature, public mutation databases, population frequencies, mutation nature, family segregation and prediction tools. Results: We identified more than 200 unique pathogenic or likely patho genic mutations among which 50 were never published before. Truncating mutations were the most common type of variations. Missense mutations showed a non homogenous distribution with high density in exons 50 to 53 encoding the highly conserved SET domain of KMT2D protein. Most of mutations were de novo and a very few cases showed a dominant inheri tance from a parent with all or any clinical evidences of the proband. Some of these de novo mutations were recurrent highlighting the existence of mu tational hot spots on KMT2D. Conclusions: This large cohort allowed us to collect and classify a large number of unpublished mutations. This work has been shared on a public LOVD database (http://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/KMT2D) in order to improve both interpretation of KMT2D variants and management of Ka buki patients.",2016
25549,"Background and aims: Implementation of exome sequencing in individuals with intellectual disability syndromes has enabled the identification of de novo heterozygous mutations in up to 40% of patients with severe ID. Re cently, heterozygous truncating mutations in KAT6A have been reported in 10 individuals by two independent groups as the cause of a distinct ID syn drome. Common features included global developmental delay, hypotonia, speech delay, microcephaly and/or craniosynostosis and craniofacial dis morphisms. Here we present a girl with a de novo heterozygous mutation in KAT6A with a phenotype that resembles the one reported in previous cases, reinforcing the association between KAT6A mutations and a new recogniz able syndrome. Method: Whole exome sequencing was performed as a trio in this family in an attempt to identify de novo mutations causing the ID and the peculiar phenotype observed in this girl. At 22 months she presented with growth and developmental delay, congenital heart defects, microcephaly and di stinctive facial features. Inicial investigations (cerebral MRI, skeletal survey, abdominal US scan, metabolic screen, standard chromosome analysis and a 60K customized aCGH) were all normal. Results: A de novo mutation in KAT6A was detected: NM_001099412.1:c.4228_4232delAAAGA(p. Lys1410Glyfs*7).This change was confirmed by San ger sequencing. Discussion and conclusion: This case contributes to delineate the phenotype of a new intellectual disability syndrome associated with KAT6A mutations and highlights the potential of whole exome sequencing for the identificati on of causal mutations in individuals with intellectual disability where no diagnosis has been reached after routine investigations.

25550,"Barel et al. (2008) mapped a new KCNK9 imprinting syndrome to chromo somal region 8q24 in a large Arab Israeli family, and demonstrated that this syndrome is caused by a specific missense mutation 770G>A in exon 2, re placing glycine at position 236 by arginine (G236R) in the maternal copy of KCNK9 within this locus. KCNK9 (also called TASK3) encodes a member of the two pore domain potassium channel (K2P) subfamily. This gene is normally imprinted with paternal silencing, thus a mutation in the maternal copy of the gene will result in disease, whereas a mutation in the paternal copy will have no effect. Exome sequencing in 4 other patients with deve lopmental delay and central hypotonia revealed de novo G236R mutations. These patients demonstrated congenital hypotonia, variable cleft palate, normal MRIs and EEGs, delayed development, and severe feeding problems. Associated facial dysmorphic features included dolichocephaly with bitem poral narrowing, short philtrum, tented upper lip, palatal abnormalities, and small mandible. Features in older members of the original Arab Israeli family included intellectual disability of variable severity, severe feeding dif ficulties in infancy with dysphagia of liquids and dysphonia with a muffled voice into early adulthood, generalized hypotonia, weakness of proximal muscles, elongated face with narrow bitemporal diameter, and reduced fa cial movements. We describe the clinical features in the 4 recently recogni zed patients and compare them with those found in members of the original Arab Israeli family and suggest this may be a treatable disorder.

It interacts with neuronal proteins, including the synaptic scaffolding protein CASK, which is associated with an X linked intellectual disability (ID) syndrome (OMIM#300749). To date, only a few patients with pathogenic variants in KIRREL3 have been reported (OMIM#612581): their phenotype was described as mild to severe ID, without further details, highlighting the need for a better clinical delinea tion of this syndrome. Here, we report a case of a 12 year old male with moderate ID, obesity, ADHD and behavioural problems, mostly hyperphagia. The patient also had mild dysmorphic features, such as enophthalmia, bulbous nose, short phil trum, thin upper lip and wide spaced teeth with two missing superior cani nes. Brain MRI revealed wide asymmetrical ventricular spaces. Array CGH, FMR1 testing and 15q11.2 DNA methylation were all normal.

25552,"Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are over lapping disorders that constitute a major public health problem with a cu mulated frequency of about 2.5%. Progress in genome analysis has allowed the identification of many recurrent CNVs and more than 600 genes impli cated in monogenic forms of ID/ASD. However, information on the clinical spectrum and natural history is often lacking behind. These data are essen tial for improved clinical management of patients and genetic counselling of family members. Therefore, we initiated a unique database model for specific genetic causes of ID/ASD, called GenIDA (genida.unistra.fr), whereby clinical information is entered and updated by the family of the affected individual based on a structured clinical questionnaire that is available in multiple languages. We have used Koolen de Vries syndrome (KdVS) as a test case for the GenIDA approach. KdVS is a multi system condition characterized by (neonatal) hy potonia, moderate ID, epilepsy, congenital abnormalities and characteristic facial dysmorphism. We transferred a large existing family based KdVS clini cal dataset (>70 cases) and asked parents to update the data on the GenIDA website. This project shows the willingness of parents to participate in studies dealing with rare diseases affecting their child. Direct comparison with data collected by clinicians allowed us to evaluate the quality of the data entered by families, search for novel and/or more penetrant comorbidities (i e. be havioral problems like hyperactivity were significantly more reported) and generate a first natural history analysis.

25553,"LINGO1, a transmembrane receptor, is predominantly expressed in central nervous system and is involved in the inhibition of neuronal myelination, through activation of the NgR1 signaling pathway. Various GWAS and ex pression studies have implicated increased expression of this gene with Multiple Sclerosis, Essential Tremor and ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease. We have stu died two unrelated Pakistani consanguineous families from different areas of the country. Eleven patients of both families presented with moderate to severe intellectual disability, speech and motor delay. Out of 11 pati ents, four presented with microcephaly and seven with generalized tonic clonic seizures. We performed exome sequencing in order to identify the potential causal variant. We have identified a homozygous missense variant (NM_032808.6:c.869G>A:p.(Arg290His)) in family one and different homo zygous variant in family two (NM_032808.6:c.863A>G p.(Tyr288Cys)) in LINGO1, that were predicted to be pathogenic by SIFT , PolyPhen and Mu tationTaster, and segregated with the phenotype in the respective families. NgR1 signaling pathway mediated by LINGO1 NgR1 complex, negatively regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and neuronal survival. Previously mouse and zebrafish models have been described and presented the role of LINGO1 in abnormal neuronal development and central nervous system myelination. Taken together, our results indicate that LINGO1 missense va riants cause autosomal recessive intellectual disability.

25554,"Introduction: The autosomal dominant mental retardation syndrome 20 (MRD20) is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the MEF2C gene and characterized by severe intellectual disability with absent speech, limited walking abilities, hand stereotypies, epilepsy, and lack of major malforma tions. MEF2C is essential for early neurogenesis, neuronal migration and differentiation of the brain. To date, all individuals reported have been sim plex cases, resulting from de novo deletions or point mutations. We report a case with putative gonadal mosaicism in a parent leading to siblings with MRD20.Material and methods: Female siblings (2 and 10 yrs) of healthy unrelated parents. The children had a similar phenotype with severe intellectual disa bility, absent spoken language, few seizures, stereotypic hand movements, unstable wide based gait, and minor facial dysmorphism. Whole exome sequencing was carried out and mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: A pathogenic heterozygous frame shift mutation in MEFC2, NM_001193347.1:c.582delT was detected in lymphocytes from both girls. The mutation was not found in lymphocytes from any of the parents. The parents did not wish to have any other samples taken in order to confirm a somatic or germline parental mosaicism. Conclusions: Finding the same mutation in siblings, and not in the parents, indicates parental gonadal mosaicism. To the authorsÃ¢ÂÂ knowledge, this has not been described before for MRD20, suggesting that the recurrence risk, for parents with a child with MRD20, might be higher than by chance alone. Considerations of (and testing for) mosaicism might be considered a helpful tool in the genetic counseling of these families.",2016

Excel analysis and Chi squared testing was performed. Undiagnosed pati ents were labelled Ã¢ÂÂlikelyÃ¢ÂÂ genetic disease if they had 2/3 of: developmental delay, congenital abnormality or parental consanguinity, and Ã¢ÂÂhighly likelyÃ¢ÂÂ if they had 3/3. Undiagnosed patients with obvious alternative causes were not labelled. Results: 749 patients were included. 53.8% (403) had undergone genetic testing, of which 26.2% (164) had a confirmed genetic diagnosis. 40.7% of those undergoing genetic testing had a confirmed genetic diagnosis (128/403).

25562,"Introduction. Recurrent mosaic duplications are exclusive in the available literature. This is especially the case in terms of clinically relevant X chro mosome duplications in females. However, a growing amount of reports on somatic genome variations causing intellectual disability and congenital malformations allows speculations that mosaic (sub)chromosomal rear rangements might be more common and clinically relevant than previously recognized. Materials and Methods. Molecular karyotyping using SNP/oligonucleotide microarray (resolution: >1 kbp) was performed in a cohort of 402 children with intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy and/or congenital malformati ons. Results. Four girls (~1%) have exhibited mosaic duplications spanning Xq26.2q26.3.The age varied from 1 year 1 month to 6 years. Shared features included intellectual disability/developmental delay, microcephaly, broad phyltrum and wide nasal bridge, long lashes, ptosis; one patient demonstrated autistic features. The overlapping region for all duplications included 8 genes: GPC3, MIR19B2 , MIR106A, PHF6, HPRT1, MIR503, MIR424, PLAC1. Although non mosaic duplication in this region involving genes PHF6 and HPRT1 has been described in the literature previously, the lack of phenotypic resemblance to the detected cases and an original bioinformatics analysis allow the specu lation that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 might be a new chromosomal syndrome associated with intellectual disability and congenital malforma tions. Conclusions. Our study demonstrates that mosaic duplications Xq26.2q26.3 are relatively common in children with intellectual disability, autism, epi lepsy and/or congenital malformations. Furthermore, our findings demon strate the possibility that mosaic chromosomal rearrangements can be a cause for a new chromosomal syndrome.

Sequence variants were called by two independent platforms: the GATK pipeline installed on the MiSeq and the CLC Biomedical Genomics platform (Qiagen, Hilden, Ger many). All variants with putative effect on amino acid level were screened for clinical und molecular concordance (i.e. disease association of the gene, published mutation) and all modes of inheritance (dominant de novo, auto somal recessive, X recessive) were considered. The results were discussed in a team of clinicians and molecular geneticists and relevant variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: Using the mendeliome in a diagnostic setting, we established a diagnosis in 16 of the 57 index patients (28%). For seven further patients, we found one or two possibly causative candidates (13%). 5 patients (9%) showed incidental findings which either made treatment or surveillance necessary (homozygous MUTYH mutations, SDHA mutation) or led to an increased risk for a recessive disease in children (PAH or CFTR mutations).Conclusion: Mendeliome sequencing significantly increases the diagnostic yield in patients with ID unsolved by previous routine testing (array CGH, karyotyping). However, variant interpretation remains challenging and re quires standardized procedures for using the new technology in a standard diagnostic setting.",2016
25564,"The genome wide significance of non coding CNVs has not been studied in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Therefore, by high resolution chro mosomal microarray analysis, we investigated all non coding CNVs in 121 patients with undiagnosed NDDs. We detected 548 rare non coding variants with a median size of 8 kb, of which 94 (~17%) were seen < 3 times in our total in house arrays and had medium to high regulatory scores. The scoring system was based on the evolutionary conservation and affected non coding RNAs, cis regulatory elements and histone modification markers. Conside ring the pattern of inheritance and/or literature assessment, we classified 9 of 94 (~9.6%) as strong candidates of which 6 were true positive. From the se variants, two (25 kb de novo and 122 kb inherited losses) were within the regulatory enriched intronic parts of ALCAM and GRM5 respectively, both involved in major neuronal processes. We also detected a 21 kb maternal ly inherited X chromosomal gain in a boy, overlapping the non coding last exon of the gene SYAP1 and strong regulatory elements in cis. Furthermore, we found a 44 kb loss affecting strong regulatory elements near the DAAM1 and DACT1 involved in the Wnt signaling pathway which co segregated with the phenotype in a family with three affected members. Of note, in the latter two cases, whole exome sequencing did not reveal any pathogenic variant. Accordingly, we were able to illustrate a genome wide overview of rare non coding CNVs in patients with NDDs as well as non coding CNVs possibly con tributing to the phenotypes of 4 (3.3%) of the patients.

25565,"Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to assess the penetrance of NRXN1 deletions. Methods: We compared the prevalence of NRXN1 deletions identified among 19,263 clinically referred cases to that of 15,264 controls. The bur den of additional clinically relevant CNVs was used as a proxy to estimate the relative penetrance of NRXN1 deletions. Results: We identified 41 (0.21%) previously unreported exonic NRXN1 deletions ascertained for DD/ID, significantly greater than in controls [OR,8.33 (95% CI 2.98 23.25), p< 0.0001)]. Ten (22.7%) of these had a second clinically relevant CNV. Subjects with a deletion near the 3Ã¢ÂÂ end of NRXN1 were significantly more likely to have a second rare CNV than sub jects with a 5Ã¢ÂÂ NRXN1 deletion [OR,19.30 (95% CI 3.50 147.24), p<0.0001]. The prevalence of intronic NRXN1 deletions was not statistically different between cases and controls (p,0.613). The majority (63.2%) of intronic NRXN1 deletion cases had a second rare CNV, a five fold greater prevalence than for exonic NRXN1 deletion cases (p,0.003).Conclusions: The results support the importance of exons near the 5Ã¢ÂÂ end of NRXN1 in the expression of neurodevelopmental disorders. Intronic NRXN1 deletions do not appear to substantially increase the risk for clinical phe notypes. Funding support: C. L. is supported by a Frederick Banting and Charles Best CIHR Doctoral Award. A.

25566,"Introduction: Phelan McDermid (PMS) or 22q13.3 deletion syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Clinical features include moderate to severe intellectual disability and behavioural problems in the autism spectrum. Other researchers had observed a beneficial effect of intranasal insu lin on development and behaviour in a pilot study in six children with PMS. To validate this effect, we conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial using a stepped wedge design. Material and methods: Twentyfive children aged 1 to 16 years with a 22q13.3 deletion including the SHANK3 gene participated in the clinical trial for a period of 18 months. Starting 6 months before the trial, children were sy stematically assessed for development and behaviour every 6 months. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th assessments were followed by daily nose sprays containing either insulin or placebo for a 6 month period. A 5th assessment was done directly after the end of the trial. Results: Intranasal insulin did not cause serious adverse events. It increased the level of developmental functioning by 0.4 1.4 months per 6 month pe riod that, while not statistically significant in this small group, was conside red clinically relevant. A stronger, significant effect was observed in children older than 3 years, who usually show a decrease of developmental growth. Conclusions: Although the application of intranasal insulin is a promising therapeutic approach, clinical trials in larger study populations are required to prove the therapeutic effect of intranasal insulin in PMS.

25567,"Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is defined by the association of severe intel lectual disability, a typical facial gestalt and additional features, including breathing abnormalities. It is caused by haploinsuffciency of the TCF4 gene. The PTHS phenotype overlaps with different conditions, including mainly Angelman, but also Mowat Wilson, Christianson and Rett syndromes. A total of 260 subjects were referred because of clinical suspicion of PTHS. The genetic diagnosis was obtained in 40/260 (15%) as follows: TCF4 in tragenic variants (30); large 18q21 deletions (2); partial TCF4 deletion (1); balanced de novo translocations (2); MECP2 variants (2); UBE3A variant (1); ZEB2 variants (2).All patients were first distinguished into two categories, depending on clini cal presentation. Group A included 125 subjects who all had severe ID with nearly absent speech and high clinical score for PTHS; group B included the remaining 135 subjects with mild to moderate ID and low clinical score for PTHS. All patients with a proven genomic mutation were in group A, increasing test sensitivity from 15% to 32%.A clinically driven flowchart is suggested in PTHS phenotype, including step by step the following tests: 1)TCF4 analysis; 2) array CGH; 3) conventional cytogenetics; 4) NGS gene panel analysis (TCF4, CNTNAP2, NRXN1, UBE3A, SLC9A6, MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1, MEF2C, ZEB2, ATRX); 5) whole exome se ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

25568,"Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder cha racterized by a distinctive phenotype. PTHS phenotype is caused by mutati ons or variable size deletions involving TCF4 gene (18q21) implying haplo insufficiency of this gene. Mosaic structural rearrangements are extremely rare events and pose great challenges for interpretation. There is very limi ted literature on mosaic deletions affecting TCF4 gene in which patients are described to manifest the full spectrum of the disorder. Herein, we report two unrelated individuals bearing deletions in a low mosaic state. The first case is the non affected father of a patient with a PTHS spectrum phenotype. A deletion of 263.4 kb was identified in the patient removing exons 4 9 of TCF4 gene. The deletion was inherited from the father who carries the deletion in a mosaic state (~20%). This is the first PTHS case reported in the literature of a deletion affecting TCF4 inherited from a clini cally unaffected parent. The second case involves a patient with a phenotype consistent with PTHS. Array CGH revealed a very low mosaic (15%) 18q21.2q21.33 deletion of 10.17Mb in size harbouring theTCF4 gene which was confirm by FISH ana lysis (11%). Family studies are ongoing. Our findings and review of the literature support that deletions affecting TCF4 independent of their size appear to have no significant effect on the se verity of the syndrome. However, it is also demonstrated that mosaic 18q21 deletions can have a normal phenotype which contradicts previous observa tions that mosaic status of such deletions cause similar phenotypes.",2016
25569,"Verheij syndrome (OMIM 615583) is associated with rare de novo 8q24.3 microdeletions. Patients show developmental delay, short stature, microce phaly, coloboma, and craniofacial, skeletal, cardiac and renal defects. Initial ly two patients were described with deletions of 15 24 Mb, later followed by five patients with much shorter deletions, the smallest encompassing only three genes, SCRIB , PUF60 and NRBP2 . A de novo loss of function missense PUF60 mutation was also found in a similar patient who however lacked coloboma and renal abnormalities. These observations and knockdown of PUF60 and/or SCRIB in zebrafish suggested that the two genes influenced different symptoms, together exacerbating the phenotype of the syndrome. We report a 16 year old boy with autism, moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, cardiac and renal defects, skeletal anomalies and a facies with bitemporal narrowing, thick eyebrows, long philtrum, broad nasal root and thin upper lip. Karyoty ping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Whole exome sequencing of the family trio identified a private heterozygous de novo deletion of four nucleotides in PUF60 (NM_078480.2:c.407_410delTCTA,p. I136Tfs*31). The patient showed no eye symptoms but no focused ophthalmological exami nation has been performed yet. The presence of severe renal hypoplasia in the patient and his overall similarity to the typical picture of the Verheij syndrome suggest that also the renal symptoms can be attributed solely to defects of PUF60 which may be of key importance for the syndrome.

25570,"Smith Magenis (SMS) and KBG syndromes are rare autosomal dominant dis orders characterized by distinctive facial features and intellectual disability (ID), caused by RAI1 and ANKRD11 haploinsufficiency, respectively. Here we describe a 46,XX girl aged 8 years, who shows mild to moderate facial dysmorphisms, ID, and an autism spectrum disorder. Upon exclusion of 17p11.2 SMS locus deletion by previous genetic investigation, RAI1 muta tional screening identified an unreported heterozygous missense mutation (p. G1036R) inherited from the healthy father who shares with his daugh ter the facial aspect only. MLPA and RT qPCR analyses on RAI1 revealed a wild type condition, whereas high resolution array CGH analysis disclosed a rare de novo deletion at 16q24.3, never reported in healthy subjects. The deletion affects the last two exons and the 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR of ANKRD11. RT qPCR per formed on the KBG gene revealed the simultaneous existence of wild type and truncated mRNA, each present at 50% of the total amount detected in healthy controls. Based on these findings and considering that ANKRD11 mutations have been reported in a few clinically borderline Cornelia de Lange (CdLS) patients, a clinical revaluation of the proband was performed. Neither microcephaly and developmental delay, generally associated to CdLS, nor macrodontia and short stature, hallmarks of the classic KBG phenotype, were observed. However, the proband shows a composite phenotype mixing up KBG and SMS signs. This peculiar clinical picture might result from the combined ef fect of RAI1 mutation and ANKRD11 de novo deletion, which does not likely imply gene haploinsufficiency, as in classical SMS and KBG syndromes.",2016
25571,"Deletions and duplications involving the genes RBFOX1 and DOCK8 have been implicated in intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disor ders (ASD). However, the clinical significance of these CNVs is controversial. We analysed 14 RBFOX1 deletions (20 309 kb), six RBFOX1 duplications (34 kb to 1.34 Mb), and eight DOCK8 deletions (22 227 kb) from unrelated individuals. Our analysis revealed that five DOCK8 deletions were terminal and three were interstitial. Two deletions lie within intron 1, two include only exon 1, and four include multiple exons. Thirteen of the RBFOX1 de letions lie within a single intron; deletion of intron 3 and intron 4 are the most common. Though the clinical information provided is limited, seven individuals with RBFOX1 deletions have a diagnosis of ASD. The clinical si gnificance of duplications is difficult to interpret since intragenic gains can lead to loss of function, whereas whole gene duplication can lead to triplo sensitivity. Half of the RBFOX1 duplications have one breakpoint upstream of the gene and one breakpoint in intron 2, which is predicted to maintain the reading frame if the duplications are in direct tandem orientation. One RBFOX1 duplication lies entirely within intron 3 and two include only exon 4, which could lead to an out of frame transcript. Our analysis sheds light on the genomic structures of small CNVs implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Only two CNVs had identical breakpoints, suggesting diversity in RBFOX1 and DOCK8 rearrangements rather than a few common variants. However, the clinical significance of these CNV remains unclear since all CNVs we included were inherited. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 173Back to index",2016
25572," Introduction: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disor der characterized by intellectual disability, regression of development and progressive microcephaly. RTT is mainly caused by mutations in MECP2; although mutations in other genes (CDKL5 and FOXG1) are also found. Ho wever, a number of patients who show a clinical diagnosis of RTT have no mutations in these genes. Recently, Next Generation Sequencing technology (NGS) has changed genetic diagnosis because of its ability to detect rare, de novo mutations. Material and Methods: We designed a NGS panel with 21 genes (ARX, BDNF, CDKL5, FOXG1, FOXP1, FOXP2, GABRD, HERC2, JMJD1C, KCNQ2, MECP2, MEF2C, MFSD8, PLP1, SCN2A, SHANK3, STXBP1, TBR1, TCF4, UBE3A and WDR45). The panel consists of 11874 amplicons (196.569 Kb), with 98.57% target coverage. Target enrichment was performed by HaloplexHS. Libra ries were sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM platform. SureCall software was used for raw data alignment and variant annotations. Torrent SuiteTM and Ion ReporterTM software were then used for variant analysis. Results: Our custom panel has been validated detecting all the known mole cular changes (table below). Furthermore, new variations have been found which are under study.

The vast majority of cases occur spora dically due to de novo heterozygous mutations. RSTS is caused in 50 60% of cases by mutations in the CREBBP gene and by EP300 gene mutations in 5 8%.Subjects and methods: A 9 year old female patient was referred from Neu ropediatrics for suspected RSTS. DNA was obtained from blood of the pati ent and her mother. CREBBP and EP300 MLPA, panel based NGS of CREBBP and EP300 genes and Sanger sequencing confirmation was carried out. Se quence changes were compared to the mother. Results: The patient and her mother presented with mild learning difficul ties, short stature and microcephaly. The mother had broad thumbs, whe reas the child had normal thumbs and halluces. A novel heterozygous de letion in exon 31 of EP300 gene (c. 7219_7222del) was found in both the proband and her mother, indicating that the mutation is inherited. This is a clearly pathogenic frameshift mutation (p. S2407fs).Conclusion: This is the first report of an inherited EP300 mutation in RSTS worldwide, and the first familial RSTS case in Spain, demonstrating that transmission is extremely rare. Since most individuals with RSTS due to EP300 mutation are mildly affected, this entity is likely underdiagnosed. thus special attention should be paid in them.",2016
25574,"BACKGROUND: Rubinstein Taybi syndrome is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by growth deficiency, broad thumbs and great toes, intellectual disability and characteristic craniofacial appearance. Mutations in CREBBP account for around 55% of cases, with a further 8% attributed to the paralogous gene EP300. Comparatively few reports exist describing the phenotype of Rubinstein Taybi due to EP300 mutations. METHODS: Clinical and genetic data were gathered from 9 pa tients from the UK and Ireland with pathogenic EP300 mutations, identified either by targeted testing or exome sequencing. RESULTS: All patients had mild or moderate intellectual impairment. Behavioural or social difficul ties were noted in eight, including three with autistic spectrum disorders. Typical dysmorphic features of Rubinstein Taybi were only variably present. Additional observations include maternal pre eclampsia (2/9), syndactyly (3/9), delayed bone age (2/9), feeding or swallowing issues (2/9), scolio sis (2/9) and hypermobility of the elbow (2/9). Six patients had truncating mutations in EP300, with pathogenic missense mutations identified in the remaining three. DISCUSSION: The findings support previous observations that microcephaly, maternal pre eclampsia, mild growth restriction and a mild to moderate intellectual disability are key pointers to the diagnosis of EP300 related Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Variability in the presence of typical facial features of Rubinstein Taybi further highlights clinical hetero geneity, particularly among patients identified by exome sequencing. Fea tures that overlap with Floating Harbor syndrome including craniofacial dysmorphism and delayed osseous maturation were observed in 3 patients. Previous reports have only described mutations predicted to cause haplo insufficiency of EP300. This cohort includes the first described pathogenic missense mutations in EP300.",2016

The 5 patients shared the characteristic features of the SAS: intellectual disability with limited speech development (5/5), cleft (1/5) or high arched palate (4/5), and dental abnormalities (5/5). 4 patients presented one frac ture and osteopenia was seen in two of the patients, confirming that this fin ding could be added to the list of distinctive findings. All patients had dental abnormalities with macrodontia of primary and permanent teeth, irregular shape of the teeth, dental crowding.

Biallelic mutations of genes belonging to the SLC25 family cause a wide range of metabolic disorders with CNS involvement. As a deletion of the SLC25A43 gene has been subsequently found in a healthy subject and the expression of this gene in the brain is low, a pathogenic role for the SLC25A5 has been suggested. The deletion identified in our patient is the smallest deletion reported so far encompassing the SLC25A5 gene and confirms that its deficiency can cause neurodevelopmental disorders.",2016

Using whole exome sequencing we identified potentially deleterious variants in eight patients.

Analyses of coexpression networks and biomedical text mining suggest that these pathologies and SMS are part of the same disease network. Further support for this hypothesis comes from transcriptome profiling of 10.5 dpc embryos that shows that the expression levels of both ZEB2 and MAP2K2 are perturbed in Rai1 / mice. Chromatin conformation capture revealed contacts between RAI1 and the ZEB2 and GLDC flanking loci, as well as between RAI1 and human orthologs of the genes that show perturbed expression in a Rai / mouse model, in particular genes mapping to MMU11. This finding possibly explains the enrichment of MMU11 mapping genes within genes differentially expressed in Rai1 / mouse embryos. These holistic studies of RAI1 and its interactions allow insight into SMS and other disorders associated with intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities, demonstrating the utility of a comprehensive genomic approach even in the diagnosis of distinctive disorders.

25580,"Introduction: Syndromic intellectual disability (ID) comprises a group of clinically and genetically heterogenous conditions, in which intellectual de ficits are associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms. Herein, we present genetic analyses leading to identification of a novel gene associated with syndromic ID in a consanguineous family. Materials and Methods: All family members including two affected siblings were SNP genotyped in order both to perform genome wide copy number variation (CNV) profiling and linkage analysis. This strategy was accompa nied by exome sequencing in the affected sib pairs. Results: CNV analysis did not detect common pathogenic CNV events in the two affected sibs. SNP derived linkage analysis was overlapped with exome variants, which enabled us to investigate exome variants only in linkage in tervals. This collective effort led us to identify a new substitution in a novel gene encoding a member of alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily on chromo some 20. Upon this finding, the first degree cousin of the affected sib pair having a similar phenotype was also recruited to the study. The variant was also shown to be segregating with the disorder in this new branch of the family. Pathogenicity of the variant is supported further by in silico tools and its absence in public databases and apparently healthy 300 controls from Turkey. Conclusions: Combined analysis of linkage and exome sequencing has pro ved to be a powerful approach proved to identify defective genes in con sanguineous pedigrees. This study was supported by the grants of TUBITAK (113S331) and Istanbul Development Agency (TR10/15/YNK/0093).",2016

The minimal critical region also involved the CDX1, SLC6A7, CAMK2A, ARSI and CD74 genes. Authors suggested that CAMK2A could be responsible for the ID, alt hough a combinatorial effect with the other deleted genes could not be ruled out. We report on a new patient with TCS1 and ID, with a smaller deletion (ranged from 150kb to 180 Kb) that only included TOCF1, ARSI and CAMK2 genes. The girl was referred for genetic evaluation at four months of age, due to abnormal craniofacial development. MLPA of TCOF1 showed a complete deletion of the gene. At the last evaluation at the age of 10 years, her facial features fit the diagnosis of TCS and she also presented behavioral disorders and intellectual disability. CGH array was performed confirming that ARSI and CAMK2A were also deleted. The function of the ARSI gene is not related with the phenotype of the patient, but CMK2A can play a role in the neuronal development. In conclusion, our patient presents a novel small deletion that narrows down the minimal critical region for a contiguous genetic disorder with TSC and ID, and strongly supports the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of CM K2A gene is responsible for the ID.",2016

TTD1 (ERCC2), TTD2 or Sabinas syndrome (ERCC3/XPB gene), TTD3 or Pollitt syndrome (GTF2H5 gene), TTD4 or BIDS syndrome (MPLKIP gene), TTD5 or IBIDS syndrome (RNF113A gene), SI BIDS syndrome, and ONMRS syndrome. We report two unrelated patients with tricothyodystrophy type 4 from the same geographical area, carrying the same homozygous mutation in MPLKIP gene. First patient is a 7 year old girl, first child of healthy noncon sanguineous parents (from the same town, 7000 habitants). Microcephaly ( 4.74 SD), growth retardation, psychomotor delay, and brittle short gro wing hair. Optic microscopy showed pili torti and break stems. Homozygous c.277delT (p. Ser93Profs) mutation in MPLKIP gene was detected by exome sequencing. Patient 2 is a 2 year old girl, second child of healthy unrelated parents, with psychomotor delay, microcephaly ( 4.66 SD), limited growth and brittle hair. Hair analysis revealed trichoschisis and break stems. Due to highly concordant clinical features and geographical overlap with patient 1, analysis of Ser93Profs mutation on MPLKIP was performed first, detecting the same homozygous mutation, suggesting a founder effect in the area.",2016
25583,"Background: Neurodevelopmental disorders have challenged clinical gene tics for decades, with over 700 genes implicated and many whose function remains unknown. The application of whole exome sequencing is proving pivotal in closing the genotype/phenotype gap through the discovery of new genes and variants that help to unravel the pathogenic mechanisms driving neuropathogenesis. One such discovery includes TRIO, a gene recently im plicated in neurodevelopmental delay. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was undertaken on a family presenting with global developmental delay, microcephaly and mild dysmorphism. Father/daughter exome analysis was performed, followed by confirmatory Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis on four individuals. Three further patients were recruited through the deciphering developmental disorders (DDD) study. Functional studies were undertaken using patient specific Trio protein mutations. Results: We identified a frameshift deletion in TRIO that segregated autosomal domi nantly. By scrutinising data from DDD, we further identified three unrelated children with a similar phenotype who harboured de novo missense muta tions in TRIO. Biochemical studies demonstrated that in 3 out of 4 families, the Trio mutations affected the Dbl homology domain and led to a markedly reduced Trio mediated Rac1 activation. Conclusion: We describe an inhe rited global developmental delay phenotype associated with a frameshift deletion in TRIO. Additionally, we identify pathogenic de novo missense mutations in TRIO associated with the same overwhelming phenotype; in tellectual disability, microcephaly, and dysmorphism with striking digital features. We further functionally validate the importance of the Dbl homo logy domain in Trio protein function. Our study demonstrates how genomic technologies are yet again proving prolific in diagnosing and advancing the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders.

25584,"Background: A syndrome of profound hypotonia, intellectual disability, intra uterine growth retardation with subsequent failure to thrive, dyskinesia and epilepsy was diagnosed in Bedouin Israeli families. Mild dysmorphism was evident: plagiocephaly, broad forehead with prominent nose, smooth phil trum and congenital esotropia. We set out to decipher the molecular basis of this syndrome. Methods: Genome wide linkage analysis and fine mapping were done. Who le exome sequencing data were filtered for candidate variants within locus. Validation and segregation of the mutation was assayed via Sanger sequen cing. UNC80 expression pattern was analyzed through RT PCR. Results: Homozygosity mapping followed by fine mapping identified a 7.5 Mb disease associated locus (LOD score 3.5) on chromosome 2. Whole exo me and Sanger sequencing identified a single homozygous nonsense muta tion within this locus, segregating within the families as expected for reces sive heredity and not found in a homozygous state in 150 Bedouin controls: c.151C>T , p.(R51*) in UNC80.Conclusions: The syndrome described is caused by a mutation in UNC80, truncating most of the 3258 amino acids highly conserved encoded prote in, that has no known motifs.

Animal models of UNC80 and NALCN deficiency have si milar phenotypes to those reported in humans with biallelic mutations in NALCN .

25586,"In a bilateral project between Germany and Jordan, we examined 28 con sanguineous Jordanian families with intellectual disability (ID) of probably autosomal recessive inheritance. We conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) for one affected individual per family and filtered for homozygous variants. With this approach we could identify homozygous truncating vari ants in the previously established ID genes NT5C2 (p. Gln447fs5), ALDH5A1 (p. Gln362*), GPR56 (p. Trp657*) and WDR62 (p. Trp836*). Although family pedigrees suggested autosomal recessive ID, we were able to identify autosomal dominant causes in 2 families. In a consanguineous family with one affected individual, CNV analysis of WES coverage data re vealed a de novo deletion on chromosome 4q21.22 21.23 which was pre viously reported in individuals with ID and fits the phenotype of the exami ned individual. In another individual we identified a heterozygous truncating mutation in TCF4 previously described in Pitt Hopkins syndrome. Segregation analysis revealed that the likewise affected sister also carries this variant while both parents are negative for this variant with no traces of somatic mosaicism. Thus, we propose that this variant is the result of a germline mosaic and causative for the phenotype. In total, with our approach of WES of affected individuals with likely auto somal recessive ID, we identified the underlying causes of intellectual disa bility in 6 out of 28 families. However, in 2 families the pathogenic changes were due to de novo events. This stresses the importance of taking into ac count all possible patterns of inheritance including germline mosaics when analyzing WES data. This project is funded through a grant by DAAD.",2016

In the search for genes involved in monogenic ID, molecular characterization of chromosomal rearrangements involving the X chromosome, and X chromosome exome sequencing, have been impor tant in the identification of the more than 100 genes to date. We report the results of diagnostic whole exome sequencing in trios to identify five fema les carrying de novo predicted pathogenic mutations in KIAA2022 (OMIM: 300524), from 1500 females with ID/developmental delay. The encoded product, X linked Intellectual Disability Protein Related to Neurite Exten sion (XPN), is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain and is in volved in the regulation of neuronal migration and cell adhesion. Our five females come from unrelated families, and are characterized by severe intel lectual disability, developmental delay, epilepsy refractory to treatment, im paired language, autism spectrum disorder, hypotonia, and ataxic gait with normal brain MRIs. Additional but less common symptoms include gastroin testinal reflux, esotropia and mild dysmorphisms. The phenotypic severity in females is similar to that observed in the 13 previously reported males with pathogenic variants in KIAA2022, who were born from unaffected mo ther carriers.

25589,"Introduction: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 30 (MRD30) (OMIM#616083) is caused by mutations in the ZMYND11 gene. Less than ten cases have been previously reported with mutations in this gene. We describe a girl with severe global developmental delay and dysmorphism. Materials and Methods: She was born to healthy and nonconsanguineous parents at 39 weeks gestation. Family history was unremarkable. Her birth weight was 2740g (10th centile), length 47,5cm (25th centile) and head cir cumference 32cm (3rd centile). Ventricular disproportion and esophageal atresia were suspected in the prenatal scans, but not confirmed after birth. On the other hand, she presented facial dysmorphism, VSD and axial hypo tonia. She also had gastro esophageal reflux, which motivated recurrent episodes of hospitalization for apparent life threatening events (ALTE), and drug resistant sleep disturbance. At 1 year and 3 months, her weight and length were above the 75th centile and head circumference was on the 50th centile. She had severe developmental delay with incomplete head control and inability to maintain a sitting position. We performed arrayCGH which revealed no significant CNV, and FISH analysis in buccal mucosa cells and skin fibroblasts to exclude tetrasomy 12p. Finally we decided for trio exome sequencing and a de novo likely causative variant was detected (c.1259C>A; p.

The array CGH better defined the extent of the de novo deletion (from 18,894,865 to 21,505,388 [hg19]), while WES did not disclosed mutations in known PD genes, but identified the controversial HTRA2 p. G399S variant in the heterozygous state, inheri ted from the healthy mother. HTRA2 is a serine protease located in the inter membrane space of the mitochondria and previous studies demonstrated that HTRA2 p. G399S leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mitochon drial morphology and decreased protease activity.

The clinical manifestations in individuals with 3p deletions vary from normal to severe. A milder phenotypic effect or a normal intelligence has also been described for larger, often inherited, deletions of this region and appears to be secondary to the breakpointÃ¢ÂÂs location and the deletion extent.

Methods: We screened a Danish cohort of 243 GTS patients and 1,571 con trols for submicroscopic deletions and duplications of these four genes. The most promising candidate gene, AADAC, identified in this Danish discovery sample was further investigated in cohorts from Iceland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Germany and Italy, and a final meta analysis including a total of 1,181 GTS patients and 118,730 controls from these six European countries was performed. Subsequently, expression of the candidate gene in the cen tral nervous system was investigated using human and mouse brain tissues. Results: In the Danish cohort, we identified eight patients with overlapping deletions of AADAC. Investigation of the additional five countries showed a significant association between the AADAC deletion and GTS, and a final meta analysis confirmed the significant association (P,4.4 x 10 4; OR,1.9; 95% CI 1.33 2.71). Furthermore, RNA in situ hybridization and RT PCR stu dies revealed that AADAC is expressed in several brain regions previously implicated in GTS pathology.

25595,Introduction: Prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption have been sug gested as possible risk factors for ADHD. Inferring causality has not been possible because the mother provides both the prenatal environment and genetic risk factors for ADHD. We investigated if there are shared genetic effects between ADHD and possible risk factors for ADHD using polygenic risk score analysis in the general population. Materials and Methods: ADHD polygenic risk scores were calculated for 8340 mothers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) based on the results of a genome wide ADHD case control stu dy (Stergiakouli et al. 2012) and tested for association with smoking and alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy and with breastfeeding status. Results: Higher genetic risk for ADHD was associated with higher odds of smoking before and during pregnancy and not breastfeeding (see Table). There was no evidence of association with alcohol consumption. Adjusting for ADHD polygenic score of the child did not change the association. Conclusions: Our results show for the first time that there are shared genetic effects between ADHD and life style choices in mothers from the general po pulation without the disorder. The mother can not only transmit genetic risk for ADHD to her offspring but also expose the child to risk factors through her life style choices that are in turn influenced by her genetic risk for ADHD.

25596,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shows substantial herita bility as measured by twin/family studies and genome wide association studies (GWAS). ADHD is about four times more common in males than fe males. What is unclear is the nature of the apparent female protective effect. One hypothesis is that female cases carry a higher burden of genetic risk. Alternatively, the sources of variation are different between the sexes. We examined these two hypotheses using genome wide data from the Psychia tric Genomics Consortium and the iPSYCH Project in collaboration with the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank. Initial sex specific GWAS meta analysis of ~11,000 ADHD cases (24% fema le) and ~21,000 population controls/pseudo controls (51% female) sho wed no genome wide significant variants for either sex. Genetic correlation analyses of female and male ADHD using LD score regression and GREML showed a strong bivariate heritability; R g(SE)~1.0(0.2). Results examining the relative burden of common genetic risk variants, using a leave one sample out polygenic risk score analysis approach, showed higher mean po lygenic scores in cases than in controls but no association of ADHD genetic risk with sex in cases. The high genetic correlation suggests that the vast majority of common va riant risk is shared between females and males in ADHD and supports com bining GWAS data from both sexes in meta analyses. Further, these results suggest that common genetic variants do not appear to play a significant role in the sexual dimorphism of ADHD. Although no significant difference in polygenic risk has been detected, these analyses are still severely limi ted in power and will benefit from increasing sample sizes.

For this, we analyzed the expression pattern of IL 1ÃÂ², IL 6, IL 10, IL 12, TGF ÃÂ² and TNF ÃÂ± in peripheral blood mo nonuclear cells of EOAD, LOAD and controls. Materials Methods: The study group consisted of 13 EOAD, 14 LOAD and 13 control patients. Quantitative Real Time PCR of each of the mRNA normali zed with GAPDH was used to determine levels of cytokines. Parametric and non parametric statistical tests were used for comparison of groups and correlations were analyzed using PearsonÃ¢ÂÂs linear correlation test. Results: IL 1ÃÂ², IL 6 and TNF ÃÂ± were found to be significantly down regula ted in EOAD when compared with the LOAD and the controls. Decrease of IL 12 expression was observed in EOAD when compared with LOAD. The correlation analyses revealed that IL 6 was inversely correlated with TGF ÃÂ² for EOAD, for LOAD, however, IL 6 with IL 10 and IL 12 with TGF ÃÂ² were positively correlated. Such differences are present in PSEN1 positive and negative patients as well. Conclusions: This is the first study comparing expression levels of periphe ral cytokines between EOAD and LOAD patients. Our results suggest that EOAD and LOAD have differences in immune response, which might be monitored in peripheral blood cells as biomarkers.

25600,"Introduction: The majority of AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD) cases arise through interactions among genetic and environmental factors, the disease usually begins many years before clinical symptoms appear. Premature centromere separation (PCS) and micronuclei (MNi) are useful cytogenetic biomarkers for prediction and early diagnosis. Constricted life space and fewer years of education are two environmental risk factors for AD, avoiding the environ mental factors in addition to early detection can significantly decrease the incidence of the disease . Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 26 patients diagnosed as AD and a group of 26 matched controls. All subjects performed life space measurement, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), conventional cy togenetic analysis, Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis and Cytokinesis block micronucleus assay (CBMN).Results: The average years of education were significantly fewer in the patients group ( * P , 0.0466) and their average life space was constricted compared to controls (* P , 0.0234). Significant positive correlation was found between score of MMSE and score of life space trajectories among the patients (Ã°ÂÂÂ;; 2 , 0.7886) which demonstrates the effect of constricted life space on cognitive impairment. Cytogenetic results revealed a significant difference in percentage of PCS and score of MNi between AD patients and controls ( * P < 0.0001) Conclusions: These results clarify that screening for AD by the environmen tal risk factors and the cytogenetic biomarkers can be valuable for early de tection as chromosomal instability occurs many years before evidence of clinical symptoms, and treatment is beneficial at this stage.

25601,"Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most severe neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the loss of motor neurons. Phenotype of ALS patients is highly variable, and suffers from the lack of re liable molecular markers. Lipid metabolism has recently been suggested as a potent modulating factor of ALS progression. The two isoforms of nuclear receptors Liver X Receptors (LXRs), LXR alpha (LXRÃÂ±) and LXR beta (LXRÃÂ²) play a central role in lipid metabolism as cholesterol sensors. Several lines of evidence have also pointed LXRs as potential candidates to explain ALS phenotype variability. Subsequently, an association study using single nu cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted to explore LXRs as genetic makers for ALS. Results: Associations between SNPs of LXRÃÂ± (rs2279238 and rs7120118) and LXRÃÂ² (rs35463555 and rs2695121) genes and ALS were assessed by genotyping using high resolution melting analysis in a cohort of 438 ALS patients and 330 healthy controls. The two LXRÃÂ± SNPs rs2279238 and rs7120118 were shown to be associated with ALS risk. Analysis of clinical parameters revealed that the two LXRÃÂ± SNPs were associated with age at onset in ALS patients (p , 0.0027 and p , 0.0298 respectively). This associa tion was also strengthened by the number of rare alleles carried by patients. Moreover, rs2695121 within LXRÃÂ² gene was shown to be associated with disease duration (p , 0.0055).Conclusions: These findings reveal a new genetic association between LXRs and both ALS risk and phenotype, opening new perspectives in the under standing of molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.",2016
25602,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem and spi nal cord. Patients develop progressive paralysis resulting in death, usually caused by respiratory failure. Until now, no effective therapeutic strategy exists. It is well documented that sporadic ALS is a multifactorial disease, in which a genetic component, such as SOD1, FTO, FUS, TARDP , C9orf72, has been evident. We have analyzed 10 unrelated Greek sporadic ALS patients by whole ge nome sequencing. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed a strong correlation between several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the develop ment of ALS. Subsequently, our analysis was expanded in 27 sporadic ALS patients of Greek origin and 50 ethnically matched healthy controls, which were genotyped by Sanger sequencing and allele specific PCR. Our data indicate a statistically significant outcome (p<0,001) for one of the studied SNPs when ALS patients are compared to healthy individuals. As far as we know, this is the first study that reveals such an association bet ween the FTO gene and the pathobiology of the disease. Nevertheless, due to small sample size, our study should only be considered a pilot study and replication in a larger population cohort is needed to confirm this finding.

25603,"Introduction: Single nucleotide variantions (SNVs) of the ANKK1 gene have been reported to be associated with a wide spectrum of dopamine related neuropsiquiatric and cognitive traits. Given that cerebral dopamine deple tion is a hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD) here we hypothesized that ANKK1 regulatory SNVs contribute to PD risk. Materials and Methods: The study included a population sample of 200 PD patients (age 69.48ÃÂ±9.51 years) and 300 healthy controls (age 60.03ÃÂ±3.33) from the BancoADN, the DNA National Bank Carlos III in Spain, and 288 PD patients (age 53.40ÃÂ± 11.91) from the clinical series of Hospital ClÃÂ­nic of Barcelona (HCB). ANKK1 regulatory regions were studied using ENCODE data and Haploview and JASPAR software. Genotyping was performed by TfiI restriction digestion of PCR amplified fragments. Functional validation was assessed by Luciferase Assay and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay. Results: Our in silico analysis showed that rs7107223 could be a functio nal SNV that modulates transcription in the ANKK1 locus. It is located at the DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) at the 5ÃÂ´ANKK1 gene. Genotyping of rs7107223 (Adenine [A] or Thymine [T]) SNV in the Spanish PD population showed the significant overrepresentation of A allele (P,0.0008) and ge notypes following a dominant model (P,0.003; OR: 1.831). These findings were replicated in the HCB clinical sample. Functional validation studies in dicated significant differences between A and T alleles in the binding, the promotor activity and the response to apomorphine. Conclusion: rs7107223 is a regulatory variant of ANKK1 locus associated with PD risk. Funding grant: Instituto de Salud Carlos III PI11/0731",2016
25604,"Background: Age associated cognitive decline and dementias have a sub stantial hereditary component but the effects of genetic risk variants may be mediated by individual characteristics. We analyzed potential associations of allelic variants in genes involved in neuronal growth and synaptic plastici ty with cognitive performance in a large dementia free elder population and explored potential interactions with age and gender. Methods: The AsIA Neuropsychology Study included 747 Spanish subjects older than 50 (mean age,66.1ÃÂ±7.6) with a moderate high vascular risk (as sessed by REGICOR score) and free of symptomatic vascular disease or de mentia. Markers (SNPs) in 5 genes (APOE, BDNF, GCSF, VEGFA, and SDF1a) were genotyped. Neuropsychological assessment included tests in three cognitive domains: visuospatial skills and speed, verbal memory, and verbal fluency. Linear regression models were controlled for gender, age, years of schooling, and metabolic syndrome. Results: ApoE ÃÂµ2 allele was associated with a better performance in the memory and fluency domains (p,3Ã¢ÂÂ¢10 4 and p,0.01, respectively). A signi ficant interaction with gender revealed that these associations were present only in women (p,2.87Ã¢ÂÂ¢10 5 and p,0.0023, respectively) and not in men, and were replicated for every individual neuropsychological test included in those domains. No other relevant associations or interactions were ob served. Conclusions: Our results show a strong effect of the ApoE ÃÂµ2 allele in women in different neuropsychological assessments for both verbal memory and fluency, suggesting a high protective effect. The ApoE ÃÂµ4 allele did not have a substantial effect on cognition in our cohort. Grants: Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (SEJ2006 15399/PSIC).",2016
25605,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most frequent neurodevelopmental disorders. ASD has a strong genetic component in its etiology, including de novo germ line mutations and copy number variants. Detectable mosaicism for chromosomal rearrangements in blood has been reported in >1% of the aging population (>65y), but is very rare in young people. Chromosomal mosaicism due to early developmental events could be causative of ASD. Methods: We have studied molecular karyotypes (SNP array) of blood DNA of two large ASD datasets, the Autism Genome Project and the Simons Sim plex Collection (4427 patients, 9268 parents, 2433 unaffected siblings) for mosaic chromosomal alterations >0.4Mb, using the MAD and Tripod soft wares. As age matched controls, we also used reported data of 5094 child ren with no developmental abnormalities. We independently analyzed data from cell line DNA of 564 patients and 806 parents. Results: Mosaic alterations (0.4 155Mb) were detected in blood DNA of 21 out of 4427 patients (0,47%). A total of 34 events were also detected in parental samples (0,37%) and 5/7517 unaffected children (0,07%). The frequency of detectable mosaicism is significantly higher in ASD patients. In cell line DNA, the frequency was similar in cases and parents although 6 unbalanced chromosomal translocations were detected in patients and just 1 in parents. Conclusion: Chromosomal aberrations present in mosaicism are detected in blood samples of a small but significant proportion of children with ASD (0,47%). This finding at early ages suggests that mosaicism may be present in other cell types affecting brain development and causing ASD.",2016
25606,"Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most heri table neurodevelopmental conditions but the aetiology remains elusive in a high proportion of cases. Complex rearrangements and gene conversion events in segmental duplications (SDs) could contribute to the phenotype, but are largely unstudied. To determine their variation and role in ASD, we have studied two candidate hot spot regions: the Williams Beuren syndro me locus at 7q11.23 and the chr9 pericentromeric region. Methods: We performed targeted sequencing of the multi copy genes in SDs (GTF2I, GTF2IRD2 and CNTNAP3) and single copy genes in 279 ASD patients and 105 controls. To identify CNVs, SNVs and gene conversions, we mapped the sequences to a single paralogous copy and integrated read depth and relative paralogous sequence quantification. All results were experimentally validated by other methods in an extended case and control population. Results: Copy gains of a 7q11.23 block containing truncated GTF2I and func tional GTF2IRD2 genes were identified in 1.8% ASD cases vs 0.45% controls. We also identified a disruptive mutation (p. M1?) in a GTF2IRD2 copy in two affected brothers, inherited from their father. In the chr9 pericentromeric region, a de novo deletion was identified in a patient but the global distribu tion of rearrangements and rare SNVs did not differ significantly between controls and patients. Conclusions: Despite their complex genetic architecture, our method suc cessfully identifies rearrangements and SNVs in SDs, such as copy gains and mutations at GTF2IRD2 or deletions of CNTNAP3 that could represent sus ceptibility factors for ASD.

25607,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by im pairments in reciprocal social communication and stereotyped behaviors. Intellectual Disability (ID) frequently coexists with these two core sym ptoms. Monogenic causes are rare, among them, de novo or truncating mu tations in SHANK3 concern almost one in 50 children with autism and mo derate to profound ID. SHANK3 haploinsufficiency is frequently associated with neonatal hypotonia, moderate to severe ID, absent to severely delayed speech, ASD and moderate dysmorphic features (Phelan McDermid syndro me). Thus, the question arises to look for the presence of distinctive signs to identify a subgroup of individuals who could benefit from the sequencing of this gene. Materials and Methods: Here we report on 2 boys with ASD and ID and a girl with severe ID associated with a SHANK3 mutation found by next generation sequencing (NGS) study (Illumina). Results: Two of these mutations are truncated and de novo involving the exon 21 in the prolin rich domain (NM_001080420.1:c.2955_2970dup (p.(Pro992Arg*325) and NM_001080420.1:c.4381C>T (p.(Gln1461*)). The third is a 3 bases deletion variant NM_001080420.1:c.5090_5092delACC (p.(His1697del)) involving the exon 22 in the SAM (Sterile Alpha Motif) do main involved in multimerization of SHANK3 protein. Conclusion: The retrospective clinical examination of these patients did not permit to distinct specific signs, which highlights the phenotypic hetero geneity of these patients. Given the scarcity of variants involving SHANK3 , the unsystematic presence of the distinctive clinical features of Phelan Mc Dermid Syndrome, a NGS approach by panel or exome seems more justified than a targeted sequencing approach of SHANK3 in this phenotype.",2016
25608,"Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are heterogeneous neuro degenerative diseases, associating a cerebellar syndrome to various other manifestations. They are frequently caused by polyglutamine expansions. Intronic repeat expansions, and conventional mutations, come next. Though 30 genes have been identified, the causative mutation is still unknown in 40% of patients. We explored ADCA aetiologies, combining whole genome linkage analysis and exome sequencing in large families, to amplicon panel sequencing of known and candidate genes in 412 patients. Sequencing a large cohort allowed us to obtain valuable information regar ding the not much known nosology of conventional ADCA. We identified 17 patients with convincing single nucleotide variants in CACNA1A (4.12%). These are classically associated to episodic ataxia 2, while small nucleotide expansions are linked to progressive ataxia. We hereby confirm that these presentations are not genetically different. We also identified eight patients with biallelic mutations in SPG7; as well as eight carriers of p. Ala510Val alo ne, whose pathogenicity we discuss. In this study, we also identified new candidate genes. CACNA1G encodes T type Calcium channel Cav3.1. A variant of its voltage sensing domain, p. Arg1715His, recurrent in three pedigrees, has consequences on the elec trophysiological characteristics of the channel, driving lowered excitability. This allows an interesting link with epilepsy, where CACNA1G gain of func tion variants are risk factors. We hence report an epidemiological study of an unprecedentedly large ADCA cohort, which has direct clinical consequences; and a new causative gene, confirming the prominence of ion channels in ADCA pathophysiology.

25609,"Introduction: We recently reported a new ataxia subtype, SCA37, characte rised by slow progressing ataxia and altered vertical eye movements in 2 Spanish kindreds. Here we report the first neuropathological findings and the studies aimed at identifying the SCA37 molecular deficit on 1p32.Material and Methods: Neuropathology, WGS, and custom aCGH studies were performed. Cerebellum specific RACE and Purkinje cells (PCs) RNAseq data from ENCODE were valuable to characterise putative cerebellar SCA37 transcripts. The SCA37 critical region was refined with WGS, SNPs, microsa tellites, and long PCR sequencing. Results: Marked neuronal loss was present in the cerebellar cortex and in ferior olives. Extensive Bergmann gliosis and loss of calbindin immunoreac tivity, with aberrant dendrite arborisation, nuclear lobulation, irregularity and hyperchromatism, and multiple small perisomatic ubiquitinated inclu sions were identified in cerebellar PCs. By WGS and genetic analyses, the SCA37 critical region was narrowed to 1.742 Mb on 1p32. Two non recom binant SCA37 linked SNPs were useful to identify additional SCA37 index cases. Cerebellar RACE and PC RNAseq studies identified new putative regu latory exons within the SCA37 transcript selectively expressed in Purkinje cells. Long PCR sequencing for SNP allele discrimination identified putative structural regulatory candidate mutations in SCA37.Conclusions: We report the first neuropathological findings showing diffuse cortical cerebellar degeneration in SCA37. Two linked SNPs prove useful to identify additional SCA37 cases. RACE and RNAseq studies reveal expres sion of a specific SCA37 transcript in Purkinje cells. We propose that a re gulatory structural mutation altering the proper temporal and/or spatial expression of the SCA37 gene underlies cerebellar neurodegeneration in SCA37.

25610,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex heritable neu rodevelopmental condition characterized by social, and communication disabilities. However, children with ASD manifest additional symptoms that further complicate the clinical picture of this disorder. Rare copy number va riations (CNVs) play a significant role in ASD susceptibility. Here, we ask wh ether rare CNVs are associated with specific clinical manifestations among children with ASD. Methods: We studied seventy clinical characteristics in 1115 children that are diagnosed with ASD and have CNV data from the Simons Simplex Coll ection (SSC). Associations between these characteristics and total burden of CNVs as well as specific CNVs, were determined at P<0.01.Results: Rare CNVs were more prevalent among African American females. Interestingly, core ASD traits (i.e. communication and social difficulties) were associated with genomic burden of duplications whereas severity of clinical comorbidities (e.g. IQ, irritability, and pregnancy optimality scores) were associated with genomic burden of deletions. Further, we found asso ciations between several clinical characteristics and specific ASD suscepti bility CNV loci. Specifically, duplications in 15q11.2 q13.1, and in 16p11.2 were associated with a higher irritability, duplications in 22q11.21 were associated with a worse neonatal optimally score, and CNVs in 9p24.3 were associated with worse verbal ability. Conclusions: Our results suggests that rare CNVs contributes to the severity of ASD across several clinical and behavioral aspects. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25611,"Introduction: Given the rapid pace of discoveries that de novo loss of func tion (LoF) mutations in highly conserved genes represent penetrant sources of genetic risk in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is imperative to gener ate robust models that recreate the human cellular landscape, particularly for neurological disorders where brain tissue is not readily available, and to eliminate the confound of different genetic backgrounds. Methods: We used an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from a healthy male subject to perform dual guide CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of 9 independent genes for which LoF mutations represent strong risk factors for ASD. The efficiency of 30 dual guide RNA combinations to generate dele tions was then compared, using either FACS sorting or puromycin selection followed by serial dilutions to obtain single cell derived colonies. Results: Dual guide CRISPR successfully generated deletions in all genes, however the efficiency varied widely by guide RNA and cellular protocol. The overall efficiency of the FACS method was 3.4% to generate predicted ablations, out of 1002 colonies screened (range , 0% 10.6%). By contrast, the puromycin method had an average efficiency of 15.1% from 4437 colo nies (range ,0% 32%).Conclusions: This systematic survey of genome editing approaches suggests that dual guide deletion generation varies widely by guide pair. We also find that the increased certainty of deriving a single cell from FACS sorting comes at a significant cost in terms of efficiency and cell viability compared to se rial dilutions.

25612,"Characteristic for autistic children is their reliability on well structured days and predictable procedures. Deviations of these cause stress in them and result in behavioural abnormalities. We therefore hypothesize that autistic children have reduced resilience for chronic stress. In order to analyse me chanism of stress resilience in autism we are using a Tsc2KO mouse model for tuberous sclerosis. TSC2 (together with TSC1) is part of a complex that inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. Mutations in either of the two genes result in increased mTOR activity and upregulated downstream signalling. mTOR signalling plays an important role in memory formation. It also is supposed to be a key player in stress resilience. According to these studies we have established a behaviour battery to ana lyse the consequences of chronic social defeat in Tsc2KO animals. After a 14 daysÃ¢ÂÂ period of chronic stress exposure mice are being analysed in this battery, which consists of an object recognition test, an elevated plus maze test, a test of nest building, an evaluation of social interaction, sucrose pre ference, spontaneous alternation in a Y maze test, a tail suspension test and the analysis of prepulse inhibition of startle response. First results show that non stressed Tsc2KO animals have alterations in social behaviour and in nest building when compared to wildtype mice. Of note, they also show an altered response to stress and changes in stress re silience. These data will give us closer insight into specific problems in au tism and will also gain our understanding of mechanisms underlying stress resilience.",2016
25613,"Background: Savant skills, are reported in 10% 30% of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The co existence of these two traits suggests com mon underlying mechanisms that require further exploration. Copy number variations (CNVs) are excellent candidate to mutually underlie these two di stinct conditions. Methods: We studied the association between CNVs and savant skills among 1108 children diagnosed with ASD from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) database. Savant skills were determined based on five designated questions from the autism diagnostic interview revised (ADI R) questionnaire. CNVs data were retrieved from a genome wide analysis of CNVs in these children. Results: Savant skills were significantly more prevalent in our sample than in other children with ASD in the SSC cohort (42% vs. 29%; P<0.001). Child ren with savant skills had, on average, a higher IQ (93.0ÃÂ±24.2 vs. 79.1ÃÂ±25.5; P<0.001), and a larger head circumference (HC) (54.3ÃÂ±2.55 vs. 53.8ÃÂ±2.60; P , 0.003). Interestingly, savant skills were associated with a lower count of rare CNVs among children with ASD (14.0ÃÂ±5.54 vs. 14.8ÃÂ±6.2 for children with and without savant skills respectively; P , 0.03). In addition, children with exceptional computational ability had lower burden of rare deletions compared to other children (203.46ÃÂ±164.25kb vs. 333.67ÃÂ±715.56kb; P , 6.8x10 5) even after accounting for IQ and socioeconomic status. We also examined whether certain talents are predisposed by specific ASD suscepti bility CNV loci, but no such associations were found.

The 11p15.4 15.5 duplication can be associated with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features. The aim was to assess the neural networks involved in visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval in ASD due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication. Materials and methods: A woman with autistic features, macrocephaly and body asymmetry due to 11p15.4 15.5 duplication and 7 healthy controls were investigated. Six runs of BOLD fMRI data were collected to assess the networks of the visual and verbal memory encoding and retrieval; a single run of encoding task was followed by 10 minute retention period, then 2 runs of the retrieval tasks both for visual and verbal domain respectively. During encoding participants were instructed to memorize the task stimu li, whilst during retrieval they were instructed to decide whether the given image or word was presented during the encoding period. Data analysis was performed using the SPM8 toolbox under Matlab, with standard processing steps. Results: In patient fMRI for visual memory encoding/retrieval showed hig her activation in the posterior insulae, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices compared to the controls where visual areas were predominant in these tasks. Verbal memory activation was higher in the hippocampi, parahippocampal cortices, precuneus; and lower in the anterior insulae; higher visual areas in our patient compared to the controls.

25616,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is endowed with impressive heritability estima tes and high recurrence rates. Its genetic underpinnings are very heteroge neous and include many common and rare variants located in hundreds of different loci, each characterized by variable levels of penetrance. Multiplex families from single ethnic groups represent a useful means to reduce hete rogeneity and enhance genetic load. We screened 19 Italian ASD multiplex families (3 triplets and 16 duplets, total N,41 ASD subjects), using array CGH (Agilent 180K). Certainly or probably causal CNVs, defined Ã¢ÂÂclinical ly relevant CNVsÃ¢ÂÂ, were detected in 17/41 (41%) of ASD probands, corre sponding to 9/19 (47%) multiplex families with at least one affected sibling genetically positive. However only in 3/9 (33%) of these families, siblings share the same causal or highly causal CNV. Additional potentially relevant CNVs not shared by affected sib pairs were detected also in these three fa milies. 45 genes are located on the Ã¢ÂÂclinically relevantÃ¢ÂÂ CNVs. Through an enrichment analysis, we found that 9/45 (20%) of these genes appear pri marily involved in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation/management. Our results highlight the importance of synaptic and neurite elongation ge nes in the pathogenesis of autism, despite genetic heterogeneity in ASD even within multiplex families belonging to a single ethnic group.

25617,"Autism Spectrum Disorder is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder with a high male to female ratio. An increased prevalence of autism like perso nality traits is found in unaffected relatives of ASD children, suggesting a genetic liability of a broader autism phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that the parents of ASD children who transmit etiological CNVs might exhi bit ASD traits more frequently than non transmitting parents. To test this hypothesis, we analysed CNV inheritance and parental behavioral traits in families from the Autism Genome Project, assessed using the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) (N,341) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (N,456). We selected CNVs spanning well established candidate genes for ASD, and compared transmitting and non transmitting parental test scores using a t test corrected for multiple testing by the Group Benja mini Hochberg Procedure. Overall, CNV transmitting parents did not differ significantly in BAPQ and SRS scores from non transmitting parents. However, independent analyses of relative pairs revealed a significant difference in BAPQ global (t, 2.18; ad justed P,.032), BAPQ aloofness domain (t, 2.61; adjusted P,.032) and SRS scores (t, 2.03; adjusted P,.047) between mothers transmitting and mo thers not transmitting etiological CNVs to their affected sons. Our findings indicate that mothers presenting personality traits in the broader autism phenotype are frequently carriers of pathogenic CNVs that they transmit to their ASD sons. The results from the analyses of maternal phenotype and CNV transmission patterns to sons support previous reports of maternal transmission bias to male offspring, and the prevalent hypothesis of a high er genetic risk tolerance in females due to putative protective factors.

The SNP array analysis demonstrated a 257 kb deletion comprising exon 6 of AUTS2 gene. Case Report: The patient was born at term as the first child of an unrela ted couple following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Mild motor and significant speech delay were evident during childhood. On her physical examination at age 68, she had short stature, microcephaly and abdominal obesity. Mild facial findings and micrognathia were noted. She was followed for scoliosis since early adulthood. Orthopedic findings were present. Her intellectual disability was mild to moderate with behavioral problems. She was noted to be a very friendly, active and girly person. She had limited eye contact, hyperverbality with limited vocabulary of 40 50 words. She had tics and obsessions, skin pricking, hyperorality and sound sensitivity.

Results: In 3/28 cases pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs, in 8/28 a mo nogenic cause was identified. We found 6 cases with mutations in autoso mal dominant neurodevelopmental genes, either reported and matching the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype (PTPN11, SETBP1), or likely associated with the phenotype (DYRK1A, GRIN2B, ASXL1, ZEB2) but previously unreported.

25620," Background: ADCY5 is a recently identified gene responsible for a wide spectrum of mixed hyperkinetic early onset movement disorders including chorea, myoclonus and dystonia. Similarly to benign hereditary chorea due to TITF 1 mutations, the disease course seems to be non progressive, but severe abrupt diurnal and nocturnal exacerbations of movement disorder are often present. To date, 7 mutations in 21 unrelated dominant families and sporadic cases have been reported. Methods: 35 Italian unrelated cases with pediatric onset hyperkinetic mo vement disorder featuring a combination of chorea, myoclonus and dystonia who tested negative for TITF 1 mutations were recruited. ADCY5 exons 2 and 10, in which mutations have been identified in ~86% of families pu blished to date, were sequenced. Results: 3/35 cases (8.5%) showed mutations in exon 10. Two sporadic cases carried previously reported mutations (p. R418W, p. R418Q) and one familial case with autosomal dominant inheritance carried a novel mutation (p. R418G).All patients presented between 1 and 4 years of age with delayed milestones and a movement disorders characterized by generalized dyskinesias, myo clonic jerks and mild dystonia. One patient showed prominent pyramidal signs in the lower limbs and perioral dyskinesia. In two cases exacerbations of hyperkinesias at night and during the day without specific triggers were described. In adolescence one patient switched from a choreic to a promi nent myoclonic phenotype. Conclusions: ADCY5 mutations are an important cause of early onset, mixed hyperkinetic movement disorders. Paroxysmal worsening of movement dis orders both during the day and at night seems to be a key diagnostic ele ment in these cases.",2016
25621,"Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a highly heritable psychiatric illness. Members of the calcium channel gene family have been repeatedly implicated in BD through genome wide association studies, case case meta analysis and pa thway analysis. This gene family includes the genes CACNA1C; encoding the ÃÂ± pore of L type calcium channels, and CACNG4; encoding a transmembrane AMPA receptor regulator involved in trafficking AMPA receptors to the neu ronal post synaptic density. High resolution melting curve (HRM) analysis and whole genome sequen cing (WGS) methods were used to identify functional variants in these genes in the UCL BD cohort. Variants predicted to impact gene regulation, tran scription or to be damaging to protein structure were genotyped in a larger case/control cohort. For rare variants publicly available data, from healthy volunteers and individuals with psychiatric illnesses, was utilised for a more accurate determination of allele frequencies. HRM identified two rare non synonymous CACNG4 variants asso ciated with mental illness (rs371128228, p,1.05x10 4, OR,4.39 and 17:65026851(C/T), p,5x10 4, OR,9.52). Fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis demonstrated that the risk allele of rs371128228 decreased cell surface trafficking of AMPA R1 (p,0.026).WGS analysis of CACNA1C intron 3 identified two BD associated (p,0.015, OR,1.15) variants 105bp apart that were in complete LD. Both variants are predicted to create YY1 transcription factor binding sites. Luciferase repor ter assays show a significant decrease in gene expression in the presence of both variants (p,0.004). Using two different approaches this study identified four functional variants in two genes previously associated with BD that have a functional effect in vitro. Grant Code MRC G1000708",2016
25622,"Introduction: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable illness, contributed to by common variants of small effect and rare variants of higher penetrance. Pa thogenic single nucleotide variants (SNV) of moderate effect are likely to be present in the encoded gene fraction (exome) and shared amongst individu als with BD in extended families. Materials and methods: We selected 15 families (117 subjects), each con taining 4 or more relatives with BD, to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) on the IonProton platform and copy number variant analysis (CNV) via CytoScanHD array (2 affected per family).We selected SNVs and CNVs shared across multiple affected subjects, but also considered de novo variants. Linkage analysis using WES derived geno types refined family specific linkage intervals. SNVs shared amongst affec ted and unaffected relatives were analysed combining all families for gene set enrichment, gene ontology and KEGG pathways. Results: The pool of SNVs shared amongst affected relatives was enriched in targets of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP) (P,8E 09) and post synaptic density (PSD) genes (P,8E 03). The X linked IRS4 gene carried a truncating mutation in 5 affected siblings in one family. This candi date gene displays restricted expression in the amygdala, and IRS4 / fema le mice show compromised maternal behaviours. Our study also implicates the protocadherin genes, which act to mediate neuronal connectivity, with loss of function variants and deletions in several families. Conclusions: Genetic approaches that combine WES, CNV and linkage analy ses in extended families is effective in pinpointing genes and pathways that may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disorder.

25623,"Introduction: rs12576775 has been found to be associated to bipolar disor der (BD) in GWAS. Downstream from the variant there is a genomic region with a high recombination rate that effectively restricts the size of asso ciated region and implicates genes for miR 708, miR 5579 and the first exon of ODZ4. In this study the miR 708 gene, its surrounding region and its tar gets have been analysed for possible functional variants associated with BD. Methods: The surrounding areas of miR 708 were screened for variation using HRM analysis in 1,099 BD cases. Whole genome sequencing data from 99 BD subjects had been analysed for variation in potential miR 708 binding sites. Results: A total of 3 variants were detected by HRM analysis across the regi on selected to be analysed. Only variants with a MAF lower than 0.01 in the general population were considered for genotyping in our case control co hort. rs754333774 has been found in 3 bipolar cases, 2 schizophrenia (SCZ) cases and no controls.

25624,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable mood disorder with a lifetime prevalence of about 1%. Models of illness are most consistent with a poly genic contribution of common and rare variants to disease susceptibility. As the cumulative impact of common alleles may only explain around 38% of the phenotypic variance, rare variants of high penetrance have been sugge sted to contribute to BD susceptibility. In the present study we investigated the role of rare variants in BD by con ducting whole exome sequencing of 81 individuals from 27 large multiply affected Spanish and German families. In each family 3 genetically distant affected individuals were selected for exome sequencing. For variant calling and data analysis, the VARBANK pipeline of the Cologne Center for Geno mics was used. We focused on rare non synonymous variants (minor alle le frequency <0.1%) that were shared among all three affected individuals and predicted to be potentially/probably damaging by at least 3 of 5 applied bioinformatics tools. Segregating variants in genes affected in at least two independent families were validated using Sanger sequencing. Among all families we identified 404 rare non synonymous and potential ly damaging variants spanning 393 genes. 8 genes harbored rare segrega ting variants in at least two independent families including RGS12 which is known to play an important role in promoting and maintaining neuro nal differentiation. Pathway analysis of all genes with a Residual Variation Intolerance Score <10% revealed significant enrichment for 18 pathways after correction for multiple testing including synaptic membrane and axon guidance.

25625,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe psychiatric disorder affecting about 1% of the worldÃ¢ÂÂs population. The highly heritable disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. As the cumulative impact of common alleles with small effect may only ex plain around 38% of the phenotypic variance for BD, rare variants of high penetrance have been suggested to contribute to BD susceptibility. In the present study we investigated 226 individuals of 70 large multiplex BD families of German and Spanish origin by whole exome sequencing (Il lumina HiSeq2500 platform). For data analysis the Varbank pipeline of the Cologne Center for Genomics was used. We filtered for rare (minor allele fre quency <0.1%) and non synonymous variants that are shared within each family and are predicted to be damaging by at least four of five different bioinformatics tools. So far, we identified 955 rare, segregating and potentially damaging variants in 889 different genes. Pathway analysis of 269 genes with a Residual Va riation Intolerance Score <25% showed a significant enrichment (p<0.001) for 37 pathways including neuron differentiation and axon development. In addition, 58 genes were implicated by rare variants in at least two unrela ted families. These comprise NRXN2 which encodes a synaptic cell adhesion molecule connecting pre and postsynaptic neurons and mediating synaptic signaling. Our preliminary results suggest that rare and highly penetrant variants in genes involved in synaptic signaling and neuron development contribute to BD.

25626,"Background: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized by migrai ne, recurrent stroke, and dementia. CADASIL is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Typical NOTCH3 mutations result in the the addition or the loss of a cysteine residue. Nonetheless, other types of NOTCH3 mutations were recently identified to also associate with CADASIL. Patients and Methods: In a cohort of 220 patients suspected of having CADA SIL, we detected by Sanger sequencing typical mutations in 70 individuals with 24 different alleles. In addition, we observed 7 variants of unknown significance (VUS) in the other 11 patients (p. G73V, p. R374,, p. S497L, p. T575,, p. R607H, p. V644D, c.2410+97A>T). In this study we examined the effects of 3 of these VUSs on mRNA splicing by analysing cDNA. Nucleid acids were isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. Results: The variants p. G73V and p. S497L did not exhibit any effect on struc ture alteration or mRNA stability. However, in silico analyses predicted that a novel variant (c.1725G>A, p. Thr575,) generates a new donor splice site in exon 11 with subsequent missplicing. Indeed, the sequencing analyses revealed a deletion of 120 nucleotides (r.1607_1726del120) that putatively causes an inframe deletion of 40 amino acids including 6 cysteine residues. This abnormality is expected to lead to uneven disulfide pairing and conse quently to abnormal folding of the Notch3 protein. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that non typical NOTCH3 variants such as synonymous or missense mutations not affecting directly cysteine residues may be a potential molecular cause of CADASIL.

25627,"Introduction: Catatonia is a motor dysregulation syndrome co occurring with a variety of psychiatric and somatic disorders. The good response to treatment with benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy indicates a neurobiological background. Environmental factors as well as genetic fac tors play a role in the etiopathogenesis. Research on the genetic aetiology is limited. We hypothesize that copy number variations known to be risks factors for neurodevelopmental disorders may play a role in the aetiology of catatonia. The aim of this study is to describe the CNVs in a population of psychiatric patients with an intellectual disability and catatonia. Methods: Fifteen intellectually disabled adults admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit and diagnosed with catatonia were selected for genetic examination. Me dical files were analysed retrospectively to collect data on cognitive func tioning and psychiatric diagnosis. A clinical genetic examination was per formed. Blood samples were taken for molecular karyotyping (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation). Results: CNVs, including 5 duplications and 3 dele tions, were detected in 8 of the 15 patients (53%). In 2 of these patients a microdeletion including SHANK3 was found. Psychiatric diagnoses in these patients are autism, psychotic and affective disorders. Intellectual disability ranged from borderline to severe disability. Conclusion: CNVs occurred in half of intellectually disabled psychiatric adults with catatonia. These fin dings suggest that SHANK3del may play a role in the aetiology of catatonia in intellectually disabled patients. Cognitive functioning ranged from bor derline to severe intellectual disability.

25628,"INTRODUCTION: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are vascular abnormalities that occur mostly sporadically and associated with a single lesion. CCM can also be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern charac terized by the presence of multiple lesions, but much less frequently. Three known genes KRIT1, MGC4607 and PDCD10 are usually studied when mul tiple cavernomas are found. When a single abnormality is found the yield of the molecular study is very low, but little is known when lesions are descri bed as suggestive and/or not clearly quantified as multiple but as discrete. We aimed to analyse our casuistic to update recommendations for testing and counselling of families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a detailed clinical molecular analysis (sequencing and MLPA of KRIT1, MGC4607 and PDCD10) in 63 CCM patients referred from the Neurosurgery Department of our Hospital, in an effort to analyze the correlation of clinical and RMN findings with the molecular results. RESULTS: We identified mutations in 35% of cases, which was increased up to 75% when only multiple lesions (n,28) were considered. No mutation was revealed in patients with a single cavernoma (n,9) neither in those with 2 lesions (n,18). Only one from 8 patients with more than two and up to four discrete number of lesions showed a mutation correlating with a positive family history. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a discrete number of malformations should be settle apart from the recognized familial multiple CCM to optimize GT yield and establish clear recommendations for clinical management and assess ment of these families.",2016
25629,"Introduction: Cerebellar dysfunction has a large impact on both cognitive and motor behavior and mounting evidence implicates the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the impact of ASD genes on ce rebellar development and function is largely unknown. Here, we defined the 15 post conception week (pcw) human fetal cerebellar transcriptome and hypothesized that ASD genes have neuron type specific expression. Materials and Methods: Laser capture microdissection (LCM) of intact cerebella from two 15 pcw fetuses enabled isolation of Purkinje cell (PC) and granule cell (GC) progenitor neurons. High quality RNA was isolated (RIN>8), sequencing libraries using TruSeq RNA Access kit were construc ted, barcoded, and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000. Paired end reads were aligned to the human genome HG19 using Tophat2, genes and counts were summarized using HTSeq. Gene level differential expression was analyzed using DESeq2.Results: On average, RNA seq generated 18 million high quality reads per sample, 96% of which mapped uniquely. Hierarchical clustering using the most variable genes within the dataset distinguished LCM isolated PC and GC samples, including several known PC or GC specific genes. ASD genes generated from exome sequencing studies were expressed either throug hout the cerebellum or restricted to PC neurons. Conclusions: LCM is an effective method to enrich for developing PC and GC neurons in human fetal cerebellum. ASD genes are expressed throughout mid gestation cerebellum or restricted to PC neurons, further substantia ting cerebellar neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in ASD, and providing a potential neuronal therapeutic target.

Classic late in fantile CLN2 has pediatric onset with initial symptoms of seizures and lan guage delay followed by progressive dementia, motor and visual deteriorati on and early death. Variant phenotypes occur more rarely. CLN2 diagnosis is based on laboratory testing following clinical suspicion. Early diagnosis is key to optimizing clinical care and future therapies outcomes, yet delays in diagnosis are common due to low disease awareness, non specific initial symptoms and limited diagnostic testing access in some regions. In May 2015, international experts met to recommend best laboratory prac tices for early CLN2 diagnosis. When clinical signs suggest NCLs, TPP1 acti vity should be the first test performed (along with palmitoyl protein thioe sterase 1 to exclude CLN1).

The regression results in significant long term impairments in social com munication skills, similar to features of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with severe intellectual disability. Extensive neurometabolic investigations usually do not reveal an underlying aetiology. We report an exome sequen cing study of a family with two affected children and neurotypical parents. Pathway analyses of rare and potentially damaging variants highlighted two variants in genes involved in intracellular trafficking and recruitment of pro teins to the centrosome: both children carry a maternal stop codon in PCM1 (NP_006188, p. E1912X) and a paternal nonsynonymous change in ALMS1 (NP_055935, p. S763N). PCM1 is an essential component of the centriolar satellites and interacts with several proteins, including DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) and BBS4 (Bardet Biedl Syndrome 4). Mutations in ALMS1 can cause AlstrÃÂ¶m Syndrome, a rare recessive multi system ciliopathy, clo sely related to the Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS). The biological functions of ALMS1 are still being elucidated, but roles in cilium function and mainte nance, intracellular trafficking, signaling pathways and cell cycle regulation have been suggested.

25632," Introduction. Chromosome 21 aneuploidy has been shown to affect the di seased brain especially in individuals with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD). Howe ver, structural chromosome 21 specific instability has never been a target for molecular (neuro)cytogenetic studies of the diseased brain. Here, we have addressed chromosome 21 structural variations in single cells of the AD, schizophrenia and autism brain as well as in the unaffected brain. Materials and Methods. Ten AD, 18 schizophrenia, 12 autism and 20 age and sex matched samples of the postmortem brain (frontal cortex, Brod mann area 10) were studied by interphase chromosome specific multicolor banding (ICS MCB) and NeuN immunohistochemistry. Results. We were able to show that rare recurrent rearrangements of chro mosome 21 or structural chromosome 21 specific instabilities are found al most exclusively in the AD brain. These were isochromosomes 21q, 21q22 >qter losses and chromosome 21 breaks at 21q21 and 21q22 affecting 0.6 3.7% of cells. NeuN immunohistochemistry has indicated that the instability randomly affects NeuN positive and NeuN negative cell nuclei in contrast to chromosome 21 breaks, which were more prevalent in NeuN positive cell nuclei. Conclusions. Our data suggests that chromosome 21 specific instability is able to contribute to the AD pathogenesis. One can hypothesize chromoso me 21 breaks confined to NeuN positive cells of the AD brain to result from the dysregulation of DNA replication/reparation or DNA damage response pathways.

25633,"Introduction. Cognitive functions in normal population and in various forms of dementia, the main of which is AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD), demonstrate a high level of heritability as well as considerable individual variability. Popu lation background appears to be an important factor in personalized health care and predictive medicine directed to prevention of common diseases, including AD. The aim of this study was to estimate the variability of genetic markers strongly associated with cognitive performance (CP) and AD across the multiple Eurasian populations. Methods. We selected 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) repor ted in recent GWAS as highly significantly associated with AD and CP , and investigated the population variability of these markers in 20 populations of Russia representing Eastern Europe, Caucasus, Central Asia, North Asia and Siberia. Results. Considerable between population variability in allele frequencies was found. Average genetic diversity ranged from 0.34 in Belorussians to 0.39 in Kazakhs. Population differentiation measured by Fst varied wide ly across the loci studied (from 0.005 to 0.144). Mean Fst for all SNPs was 0.048. Mean Fst for AD (0.033) proved to be substantially lower than po pulation differentiation for CP (0.053). Allele frequencies tend to correlate between populations according their geographical locations. Conclusion. Our data indicate wide inter population variation in the fre quency of alleles associated with cognitive functions in norm and patho logy. This variability may contribute to variation in genetic predisposition to dementia in ethnically different populations and to population specific patterns of associations.

This form is X linked and clinically characterised by a com bination of hydrocephalus in association with adducted thumbs. Besides L1CAM, autozygosity mapping revealed that CCDC88C mutations seem to cause a distinct non syndromic complex hydrocephalus inherited in autoso mal recessive way, with apparently normal psychomotor development de spite the impressive prenatal cerebral phenotype.

Most patients are homozygous for an expanded (>30) dodecamer repeat in the promoter region of CSTB. Some patients are compound heterozygotes for the dodecamer repeat and a point mutation, and these patients generally have an earlier age of onset and more severe phenotype. Case Report: Two sisters born to consanguineous parents of Sri Lankan descent presented with profound global developmental de lay, microcephaly, cortical blindness, and central hypotonia with periphe ral hypertonia. Neither sibling ever developed head control, independent sitting or ambulation, and never developed speech. The elder sister had a seizure disorder while the younger one had multiple electroencephalo grams which failed to detect seizures. Clinical examination of both sisters revealed profound microcephaly, beaked nose with overhanging columella, supernumerary teeth, and short neck. On serial brain imaging, they had pro gressive atrophy of the corpus callosum, and diffuse hypomyelination with progressive loss of myelination. Results: Exome sequencing revealed both siblings to be homozygous for a c.218dup (p. His75Serfs*) mutation in exon 3 of CSTB. Their mother was a confirmed carrier of the mutation; the father was unavailable for testing. Conclusion: The neuroimaging features of our patients are consistent with those observed in Cstb knockout mice, which supports the hypothesis that disease severity is inversely correlated with the amount of residual functional cystatin B protein. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a homozygous nonsense mutation in CSTB in humans.",2016

Few cases have been reported to date. We report on a female baby, born at 37 4/7 gestational weeks to consan guineous parents after an uneventful pregnancy. Apgar score was 2/2/3. At birth the neonate did not have sufficient spontaneous breathing and needed intubation. In addition, she developed neonatal seizures.

Our findings contributed to the discovery of the involvement of all the GATOR1 complex genes in the pathogenesis of up to 9% of FEs, in contrast to the concept that specific seizure semiologies point to the main involvement of specific brain areas. We therefore screened for mutations in GATOR1 encoding genes in an additional cohort of 65 patients with FEs using Multiple Inversion Pro be technology, finding a novel nonsense variant in NPRL3 in one additional patient.

Recently, we used whole exome sequencing (WES) on DNA from seven affec ted and three unaffected individuals from a Swedish pedigree segregating DD. High quality single nucleotide variants were filtered to retain rare non synonymous variants segregating with DD but absent from an in house da tabase of WES variants. We identified a predicted damaging mutation resul ting in a p. R229L substitution in the centrosomal protein 63kDa (CEP63) re quired for normal centriole duplication and cell cycle progression. Further, a common CEP63 variant showed significant association with white matter volume partly overlapping with regions influenced by polymorphisms in the DD susceptibility genes DYX1C1 and KIAA0319 , consistent with previous re ported roles in neuronal migration. Preliminary confocal imaging showed localisation of both endogenous wild type CEP63 and exogenous p. R229L CEP63 to the centrosome in RPE1 cells suggesting a potential dominant negative effect of the mutant protein. Further studies may reveal the impact of p. R229L CEP63 on cellular func tion and brain development.

25641,"Introduction: The paradigm of a single gene associated with one specific phenotype and mode of inheritance has been repeatedly challenged. Geno type phenotype correlations can often be traced to different mutation types, localization of the variants in distinct protein domains, or the trigger of or escape from nonsense mediated decay. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was applied to four affected individuals in two unrelated families with reported consanguinity, and two other families were sequenced with WES by a trio (proband and parents) approach. Results: We identified homozygous variants in EMC1 that segregated with a phenotype of developmental delay, hypotonia, scoliosis and cerebellar atrophy in three families. In addition, a de novo heterozygous EMC1 vari ant was observed in an individual with a similar clinical and MRI imaging phenotype. Conclusions: EMC1 encodes a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC), an evolutionarily conserved complex which has been proposed to play multiple roles in ER associated degrada tion (ERAD), ER mitochondria tethering, and proper assembly of multi pass transmembrane proteins. Perturbations of protein folding and organelle crosstalk have been implicated in neurodegenerative processes including cerebellar atrophy. Monoallelic and biallelic inheritance have previously been associated with different genes in which either de novo mutations (i.e., GJB2, KIF1A, MAB21L2, and NALCN) or recessive mutations (i.e., AARS, CLCN1, COL6A1, DEAF1, EGR2, ENPP1, KRT14, and ROR2) may cause more severe pheno type. We propose EMC1 as a novel gene in which either biallelic or monoal lelic variants may lead to a syndrome including intellectual disability and preferential degeneration of the cerebellum.",2016

This alternation was not present in the DNA samples of her parents. Results: We detected a novel missense mutation (C.678G>T) in the CACNA1A gene. No single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in this region and its probability score was nearly 1.0. The CACNA1A gene encodes the alfa1 sub unit A, a transmembrane pore forming subunit of the P/Q or CaV2.1 voltage gated calcium channel which mediated entry of Ca(2+) ions into excitable cells and also involved in a Ca(2+) dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release and gene expression. Conclusion: CACNA1A mutations were previously reported in Episodic ata xia type2, Familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 and in Spinocerebellar ataxia 6. It was also recently associated with epileptic encephalopathy. The pre sent report expands the clinical spectrum of CACNA1A associated neurolo gic and particular epileptic disorders, and suggests that early disturbance of the voltage gated calcium channel activity may underlies neuronal insult which lead to ataxia to myoclonic epilepsy.",2016

Many chromosomal abnormalities are associated with different neurologi cal conditions, including epilepsy. There are about 400 different chromoso mal imbalances described with seizures or EEG abnormalities. In this paper we present our experience regarding epilepsy associated with chromoso mal abnormalities. Methods: 125 children with epileptic seizures, other neurological features, and/or dysmorphic features were evaluated by clinical, dysmorphological, neurological, psychiatric and psychological examinations, EEG, neuroimagi stic studies (CT , MRI), biological studies, genetic investigations (karyotype, FISH, array CGH).Results: In 42 cases with epilepsy a chromosomal syndrome was identified, including Down syndrome (4 children), trisomy 18 (1 child), partial trisomy 13 (1 child), 1p36 deletion syndrome (3 children), Angelman syndrome (20 children), Miller Dieker syndrome (2 children), Pallister Killian syndrome (3 children), Williams Beuren syndrome (1 child), Wolf Hirschhorn syndro me (1 child). We identified, also, some very rare chromosomal rearrange ments, with complex phenotypes associating epilepsy, which included 3p26 duplication; 8p21.2 p11.2 deletion; 3q26.31 duplication. Discussion: Most of our patients presented chromosomal syndromes, either known to associate epilepsy in most patients (such as Angelman syndro me, Miller Dieker syndrome, trisomy 13 and 18) or rarely presenting with seizures (such as Down syndrome, Williams Beuren syndrome). Several rare chromosomal rearrangements were detected; the genotype phenotype correlations were difficult to establish in some cases (no specific genes for epilepsy are known to be located in the affected regions 3p26.3, 3q26.31). Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of epilepsy asso ciated with chromosomal abnormalities. Acknowledgments: National Project PN 09.33.02.03.",2016
25644,"Background: Epilepsy is a common clinical and genetic heterogeneous neu rological disorder, with a large number of cases caused by genetic factors. To understand the molecular basis of epilepsy, 141 genes associated to neuro metabolic disorders, syndromic and non syndromic epilepsy were routinely analysed on 50 cases. Methods: Genomic libraries were generated using the Ion AmpliSeqTM Exo me RDY as exome backbone, combined with an AmpliSeq panel design to improve gene coverage. Sequencing reads generated on the Ion ProtonTM and Ion S5TM platform were analyzed using Torrent Suite software. Annota ted variants using ION Reporter were prioritized with an in house analytical pipeline to identify the causative variants. This approach assures an average depth of 100X and an average 98.3% coverage in the selected genes. Results: Among the 50 probands analyzed, 22 (44%) were referred as Ear ly Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathies (EEIE). This approach allowed us to identify potentially genetic causative variants on 40% of the cases. Among EEIE patients 64% (14/22) were genetically diagnosed. Out of the 63 iden tified variants, 26 were associated to a gene with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, 5 of which were confirmed as Ã¢ÂÂde novoÃ¢ÂÂ. Furthermore, a combined analysis of genes related to other neurodevelopmental disorders as autism was performed on 8 cases. Conclusions: Epilepsy panels based on WES provide a cost effective and comprehensive strategy, that accelerates the identification of a definitive clinical diagnosis, decreasing the familial anxiety, improving the prognosis accuracy and facilitating the therapy selection.",2016
25645,"Background: Epilepsy encompasses a group of related neurological disor ders characterised by recurrent seizures due to abnormal electric activity in the brain. The genetic basis of the disease is complex with defects in more than 200 genes predisposing to it. The aim of our study was to perform tar geted next generation sequencing and detect gene defects in 12 Bulgarian patients with either primary (6) or secondary epilepsy as part of another undetermined condition (6). Methods: After DNA was extracted from blood, NGS libraries were prepared using either TruSight One or Trusight Inherited Disease gene panels. Se quencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq system. Variant filtering and downstream analysis was done using Variant Studio and GenomeBrowse softwares. Results: We detected pathogenic mutations in 6 of our patients (50%). Three of those with primary epilepsy carried missense mutations in SCN8A (p. Arg1872Gln), EFHC1 (p. Phe229Leu) and a deletion in CLCN1 (c.1436_1449delTACCCTGCGGAGGC). The genes affected in the patients with secondary epilepsy were RNASEH2B (p. Ala177Thr), IDS (p. Pro408Ser) and AP1S2 (p. Tyr86Ter), and their carriers were respectively diagnosed with Aicardi Goutieres syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis and X linked syn dromic mental retardation. Discussion: The genetic heterogeneity in our cohort was expected bearing in mind the wide variability in severity and penetrance of the disorders from the epileptic spectrum. This underlines the need for using large gene panels in order to successfully detect defects in patients with epilepsy as a symptom. The identification of the causative mutation could deliver crucial insights into the aetiology of the disease and potentially pave the way for a personalised treatment.",2016
25646,"Introduction: Epilepsy is the most common chronical neurological disease in humans and dogs. Canine epilepsy resembles the human condition and provides opportunity for new gene discovery, functional characterization and establishment of a therapeutic model. We previously identified young dogs with myoclonic epileptic seizures in the Rhodesian Ridgeback (RR) breed (Wielaender et al., JVIM 2016; 30:444) and aimed here to further cha racterize the clinical and genetic background. Materials and Methods: A study population of 17 RRs was established and the breed specific myoclonic epilepsy was studied by a wide scale medical examination and awake ambulatory wireless video EEG. A GWAS was per formed to map the gene in a cohort of 10 cases and 18 unaffected RRs fol lowed by whole exome sequencing of two cases. Candidate mutation was validated in a larger cohort (n,40) of cases and controls by TaqMan qPCR assays. Epileptic cases across breeds (n, 965) were also tested for the mu tation. The expression pattern of the candidate gene was established in 27 canine tissues including many brain regions by RT PCR.

25647,"Introduction: NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) approach is revolutioni sing our understanding in medical genetics and is increasingly allowing us to achieve genetic diagnosis of complex disorders. One example of such complex disorders is Epilepsy. Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain becomes disrupted, causing seizures or periods of unusual behaviour, sensations, and sometimes loss of consciousness. The genetic diagnosis of Epilepsy is usually very difficult be cause of the genetic heterogeneity and the high number of genes associated with the disease. Objective: Genetic characterization of a patient with epilepsy by targeted exome sequencing. Methods: The targeted exome sequencing for Epilepsy is encompassing all the coding regions of 116 genes associated with the disease. Library was prepared using TruSight One (Illumina) and samples were ultrasequenced using a NextSeq 500 sequencing system (Illumina).Non benign variants were confirmed and segregated in parental samples by Sanger sequencing. Results: The use of this targeted exome in a patient with idiopathic epilepsy allowed us to identify a de novo probably disease causing change in the SCNA8 gene. Conclusion: Targeted exome is a diagnostic alternative to Sanger sequencing for genetic heterogeneous diseases such as Epilepsy. This new strategy gi ves us the possibility to simultaneously analyse several genes, reducing time and cost, and increasing the diagnostic yield. Early and accurate diagnosis of patients with epilepsy is essential for suc cessful treatment and care, especially at the evolutionary phases of the di sease.",2016
25648,"Introduction: Genetic variants causing EIEE are currently identified in only a minority of cases. We explored the usefulness of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for both diagnosis and gene discovery in EIEE. Methods: Peripheral blood DNA was extracted from forty unrelated trios (proband and unaffected parents). We used NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome v3.0 and Illumina TruSeq kits to generate libraries which were 30X sequen ced in a HiSeq 2000 instrument. Exomes were aligned to NCBI build 37 refe rence sequence. Variants were called with SamTools, annotated using SnpEff and VarAnnot and classified according to predicted functional effect. Hard filters and IGV inspection were used to eliminate artifacts. Analysis was two tiered and comprised evaluation of 169 epilepsy genes, followed by evalua tion of remaining WES variants. Selected variants were Sanger validated. Results: A first tier analysis revealed high effect de novo mutations in EIEE associated genes in 45% of the cases. STXBP1, KCNQ2, KCNT1 and SCN1A were the most commonly mutated genes in this cohort. In patients with neo natal presentation, WES displayed a higher diagnostic yield, 66% (12/18; p<.01). Second tier analysis showed an excess of damaging mutations in se veral intolerant to variation genes, mainly related to synaptic function and neural transmission. Conclusion: WES analysis led to the identification of de novo disease causing mutations in genes previously related to EIEE in 45% of our cases, showing a better diagnostic yield in cases with neonatal onset. Among the remaining undiagnosed cases, several de novo variants emerged as plausible candida tes to produce EIEE. Functional ongoing studies will help determining their causative role in the disease.",2016
25649,"Introduction: Epilepsy and Mental Retardation Limited to Females (EFMR) is a rare encephalopathy associated with PCDH19 mutations affecting he terozygous females, sparing hemizygous males. EFMR is characterized by intractable, fever sensitive generalized or focal seizures initiating within the first year of life, and clustered brief seizures occurring repeatedly during several days. This study includes a 4 year old girl, whose genetic evaluation aided differential diagnosis between EFMR and Dravet syndrome (DS).Materials and Methods: A 4 year old girl with prominent intellectual disa bility was recruited for this study. Her physical, neurological, neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG) examinations were performed with in formation on family history. Her first seizure occurred at 8 months of age with fever, marking the beginning of neuromotor developmental delay. Atypical absence seizures emerged when she was 1.5 years old. She is the only affected person in the family among 2 brothers and 1 sister. Illumina HiSeq2000 was utilized in whole genome exome sequencing of the subject. Exome data was filtered to detect all genetic variants in DS related genes including PCDH19. Candidate genetic variants were subjected to familial se gregation through PCR and direct sequencing. Results: Genetic analyses revealed a novel nonsense mutation in PCDH19 apparently occurring de novo. In silico evaluations supported mutationÃ¢ÂÂs role in pathogenesis. Conclusion: This study enabled genetic diagnosis of the case as EFMR, asso ciating a novel PCDH19 mutation with the disease that provided the family with genetic consulting.

25650,"In 2003, a new syndrome was diagnosed in the Sephardic Jews population, it was named PCCA (Progressive Cerebello Cerebral Atrophy) after its typi cal neuroradiological findings. There are two types: PCCA type 1 and PCCA type 2. Known causative genes are SEPSECS in type 1 and VPS53 in type 2. PEHO (Progressive encephalopathy with Edema, Hypsarrhythmia and Optic atrophy) is a syndrome prevalent in Finland. It includes progressive micro cephaly, profound mental retardation, marked hypotonia and dysmorphic features. MRI shows progressive cerebellar and brainstem atrophy. Recently, mutations SEPSECS were found in patients with PEHO. We diagnosed 2 siblings with PEHO. They have a developmental encephalo pathy, limb and facial edema, infantile spasms and optic atrophy. MRI shows cerebellar and brainstem atrophy. Extensive workup did not reveal the cau sative gene. Whole exome sequencing was performed. The first analysis that was done 5 years ago did not reveal the causative mutations. Recently, a re analysis of the data revealed the 2 common Moroccan mutations in VPS53 (exon 19 c.2084A>G p.(Gln695Arg) and c.1556+5G>A. The parents were found to be carriers of the mutations. Comparing both syndromes reveals clinical and radiological similarities. Our revelation that VPS53 mutations, previously described to be the cause of PCCA1, and now are found as causative mutations is PEHO, actually put these two syndromes on the same spectrum. Likewise, SEPSECS gene that is the cause for PCCA1 was also found recently as the causative gene in PEHO.

25651,"Essential hypersomnia (EHS) is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness but no cataplexy, can be divided into two broad clas ses based on the presence or absence of HLA (human leukocyte antigen) DQB1*06:02 allele. HLA DQB1*06:02 positive EHS and narcolepsy are asso ciated with the same susceptibility genes. However, there are fewer studies of HLA DQB1*06:02 negative EHS. Therefore, we performed a genome wide association study in 119 Japanese patients with HLA DQB1*06:02 negative EHS and 1,582 Japanese healthy individuals to identify susceptibility genes associated with HLA DQB1*06:02 negative EHS. A replication study was conducted on 191 Japanese patients with HLA DQB1*06:02 negative EHS and 433 Japanese healthy individuals. SNP rs10988217 located in CRAT (carnitine acetyltransferase) was found to be significantly associated with HLA DQB1*06:02 negative EHS (P<5ÃÂ10 8, OR,2.8). An eQTL analysis sho wed that rs10988217 was significantly correlated with expression levels of CRAT in various tissue or cell types, including brain tissue (P<0.05). CRAT gene encodes the carnitine acetyltransferase protein, which is a key enzy me for metabolic pathways involved with the control of the acyl CoA/CoA ratio in mitochondria, peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. In additi on, The Metabolomics GWAS Server (doi: 10.1038/ng.2982.) revealed that rs10988217 affected succinylcarnitine levels in blood (P<10 17). Individu al acylcarnitines levels were measured in 36 Japanese patients with HLA DQB1*06:02 negative EHS and 68 Japanese healthy individuals. Levels of se veral acylcarnitines showed significant differences between the two groups.

25652,"Introduction: MS is chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous sy stem with important genetic contribution. Although familial contribution to MS etiology is well established, much of genetic contribution still remains poorly defined. Several case reports reported comorbidity between diffe rent types of genetic peripheral neuropathies and MS.

Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing using Nextera Coding Exome enrichment was performed in 48 patients with familial MS, 40 pa tients with sporadic MS and 92 population matched controls. Genotypes were called using GATK toolkit in multisample mode and only sites with va riant quality over 100.0 and genotyping rate of over 60% across all samples were kept in downstream analyses. The selection of variants among bioin formatically focused panel of 52 peripheral neuropathy related genes was narrowed in accordance of functional impact predicted by snpEff all trun cating variants and missense variants predicted as pathogenic by a majority of in silico predictors, were considered in further burden analyses. Results: We identified 8 candidate genetic variants (7 genes) that affect function in familial MS, and 11 candidate genetic variants (12 genes) in spo radic MS patients. Overall we detected a statistically significant 1.9 times enrichment of mutations (p,0.004) in the familial MS cases compared to the ExAC control samples.

25653," Background: Cognitive impairment can be observed not only in psychotic patients but also in their nonpsychotic relatives which highlight a familial component for the relationship between cognition and psychosis. However, not many studies have explored the degree of intrafamilial resemblance of cognitive deficits. Our aim was to examine the familial aggregation of several neurocognitive traits in a sample of patients with psychotic disorders and their first degree relatives. Methods: Familiality was explored in 71 patients and 153 healthy first de gree relatives. All underwent a neurocognitive battery (IQ WAIS,phonemic/semantic fluency,WCST).Family level residual intraclass correlation coeffi cient (ICC) was calculated. Families were ranked according to the level of familiality (IRS) for each cognitive test. Analyses were implemented with Stata v.13.Results: Significant familial aggregation was found for Intelligence quotient (IQ), phonemic and semantic fluency (executive function domain)(p<0.001). Significant IRS was obtained for IQ and phonemic fluency (p<0.001), classi fying these families according to their familiality level. No correlation was found between IRS and their neurocognitive scores (p>0.05), meaning that familial similarities among families are independent of the neurocognitive performance. Discussion: Despite that different studies have found that patients and rela tives display deficits on a variety of neuropsychological tasks, we detected that only IQ, phonemic and semantic fluency show a familial aggregation pattern. This is in line with the fact that even the cognitive heterogeneity of the illness, executive dysfunction is one of the most marked cognitive impairments in SZ (Snitz et al.,2006).In this sense, stratifying families ac cording their familiality levels may reduce heterogeneity and facilitate the identification of shared genes/environmental factors involved.

25654,"Introduction: FOXG1 gene mutations have been associated with the con genital variant of Rett syndrome (RTT) since the initial description of two patients in 2008. The ongoing accumulation of clinical data suggests that the FOXG1 variant of RTT forms a distinguishable phenotype, consisting of mainly congenital microcephaly, seizures, hypotonia, developmental delay and corpus callosum agenesis. Case Report: We report a 6 month old female infant, born at 38 weeks of gestation after in vitro fertilization, who presented with feeding difficulties, irritability and developmental delay since birth. Microcephaly, a small fore head with bitemporal narrowing, dyspraxia, poor eye contact and strabis mus were also noted. At 10 months the proband exhibited focal seizures and required valproic acid treatment. Sleep deprivation EEG showed signs of focal cerebral dysfunction. The MRI was normal. The peripheral blood G banding karyotype was normal (46, XX), as well as the DNA analysis of the MECP2 gene. Array Comparative Genomic Hybri dization was performed (AGILENT Technologies, resolution 200 Kb) and revealed a 4.09 Mb loss of the copy numbers in the spanning region 14q12, encompassing the FOXG1 and NOVA1 genes. Conclusions: The proband presented similar features with patients with 14q12 deletions except for dysgenesis of corpus callosum. Disruption of the NOVA1 gene, which promotes the motor neurons apoptosis, has not been yet linked to any human phenotypes, but could act synergistically with the FOXG1 gene in our patient. Since our patient is the first reported case with deletions of both the above genes, the thorough clinical follow up could further delineate the Congenital Rett Variant phenotypes.",2016
25655,"Introduction:Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common form of young onset dementia after AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease and comprises about 10Ã¢ÂÂ20% of all dementias worldwide. It is inherited in 30Ã¢ÂÂ50% of patients. It includes a group of degenerative diseases characterized by the atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes. Mutations in three main genes are commonly associated with FTD: MAPT, PGRN, and C9orf72 , but recent findings have identified rare and pathogenic variants in additional genes: FUS, VCP, TARDBP and CHMP2B. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is being used to identify new pathogenic variants. Material and Methods:A total of 48 FTD patients were assessed by means of a NGS panel. Target regions in the selected genes (MAPT, PGRN, FUS , VCP, TARDBP and CHMP2B) were amplified using an Ion AmpliSeqÃ¢ÂÂ¢ custom Panel. It consists of 93 am plicons (17.21Kb), with coverage close to 99.5% on targeted sequence. Lib raries were sequenced on an Ion Torrent PGM platform. Data analysis was performed using Torrent Suite TM and Ion ReporterTM software. All variants were validated by Sanger. Results: Two known pathogenic mutations (c.709 1G>A and c.359C>A) and a non described missense variant (c.1604G>A) were found in PGRN. We also detected a polymorphic variant in FUS (3Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region [UTR], c.*41G>A), whose MAF is 0.005, in three of our patients. Conclusion: This approach shows the utility of the NGS technology to iden tify both known pathogenic and low frequency variants likely associated with this disorder.

25656,"Introduction: Fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder that occurs in FMR1 premutation carriers. The prevalence of FMR1 premutation carriers in the general po pulation is relatively high, and although rare, a premutation in both X chro mosomes may occur in females inheriting a premutation allele from each of both parent carriers. Here we report the first female with an autozygous (homozygous by descendent) FMR1 premutation allele, who fulfills neuro logical and radiological FXTAS findings/criteria. Material and Methods: Molecular characterization included CGG repeat length, AGG interruption pattern, FMR1 mRNA, FMRP levels quantification and SNP microarray. Neuroradiological assessment of 3T magnetic reso nance imaging, neurological and cognitive/neuropsychological evaluations were performed. Results: Neurological and neuroradiological examination of the female with the same FMR1 allele in the premutation range (77 CGGs) demonstrated FXTAS features. Further familial evaluation showed a similar neuropsychia tric profile, with impairments in cognitive flexibility and visuospatial func tion, mainly. Conclusions: A unique family with an autozygous FMR1 premutation female is presented. Neurological/cognitive and neuroradiological examinations revealed FXTAS specific findings in the female with the autozygous FMR1 premutation allele. The consistent molecular and cognitive/psychiatric phe notype in family members suggests that carrying one or two FMR1 premu tation alleles has no effect on illness severity.

The aim was of this study was to evaluate social anxiety and autism in FMR1 premutation carriers and con trols using the Social Phobia Inventory and the Autism Spectrum Quotient. Material and Methods: Fifty nine premutation carriers (40 females; 19 ma les) (7 females and 9 males with FXTAS) were compared to 50 controls (32 females; 18 males).Results: Our results show that FMR1 premutation carriers have higher so cial anxiety scores and autistic traits compared to controls. Indeed, the SPIN scores were higher increased in women FMR1 premutation carriers compa red to men whereas the AQ scores were similar between the two genders. Finally, SPIN scores were correlated with the repeat size when the CGG num ber was greater than 100.Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that social anxiety is greater in FMR1 premutation carrier women than in controls but not in men. In addi tion, both men and women with the FMR1 premutation have an increased risk of autism traits. Our results suggest that a wide range of behavioral/psychiatric traits should be included within the Fragile X Spectrum disorder and that the penetrance of these traits depends on the genetic background (CGG repeat number, gene modifiers, epigenetic, among others) as well as on gender.

25658,"Introduction: Fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late onset multisystem neurological disorder characterized by intention tremor and cerebellar ataxia. We hypothesized that in FMR1 premutation females with FXTAS, a normal X chromosome might more frequently be in activated; therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and FXTAS. Material and Methods: We studied the XCI patterns of cases of FMR1 premu tation in 10 women with FXTAS and 21 without FXTAS. Results: The distribution of XCI patterns in the FXTAS and no FXTAS groups showed differences regarding the allele presenting severe skewed XCI. In the FXTAS group, all cases preferentially inactivated the non expanded X chromosome, whereas in the no FXTAS group, all inactivated the expanded X chromosome. As expected, we found statistically significant differences in the skewed XCI on comparing FMR1 premutation women and controls. Conclusion: Although the reduced sample size and blood XCI patterns are two limitations of this study, our results suggest that the skewed XCI of the normal FMR1 allele may be a risk factor for the development of FXTAS. Fur thermore, our findings also support the protective effect of the expression of a normal FMR1 allele.

We present a child with severe psychomotor retardation, congenital progres sive microcephaly, intractable epilepsy presenting as early onset neonatal seizures, and generalized hypotonia. Brain MRI showed a migration and sulcation defect with bilateral fronto parietal and temporal polymicrogyria. Methods: Chromosomal microarray and metabolic testing were normal. Whole exome sequencing followed by filtration of synonymous, dbSNP132 and in house database variants identified a de novo pathogenic mutation. Result: We detected a novel de novo heterozygous mutation (c.2365G>A; p. D789N) in the GRIN1 gene. The gene encodes an NMDA receptor subtype of glutamate gated ion channels with high calcium permeability and volta ge dependent sensitivity to magnesium which is mediated by glycine. NMDA receptors play an important role in the development of the central nervous system, processes of learning, memory and neuroplasticity and are crucial for neuronal communication. Conclusions: The present report expands the clinical spectrum of GRIN1 associated neurological disorders, and supports human NMDA receptors have an in vivo role in neuronal migration. GRIN1 mutations were previous ly reported in children with epilepsy, non syndromic intellectual disabilities and recently with epileptic encephalopathy but not with malformations of cortical migration. Experimental models of NMDA receptor unit specific knock down/knock out show a role for NMDA receptors in cortical neuron migration. Whether the described mutation serves as a dominant negative mutation, perhaps as a stereotactic disruption of the NMDA receptor hetero dimerization, or as a toxic gain of function is yet to be investigated.",2016
25660,"Introduction: Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) type 4 is a rare inherited disease caused by a mutation in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, type 1 gene located on chromosome 1. It is cha racterized by pain insensitivity, partial anhidrosis and pressure sensitivity. Self mutilation injury involving the teeth, lips, ears, eyes, nose, and fingers are invariable feature of this disorder. Objective: In this context, we report a Tunisian family having two children affected by HSAN4. Indirect genetic analyzes showed a transmission profile for the HSAN by mutation of the NTRK1 gene. Patients and methods: It is about a Tunisian consanguineous family. It shows two boys aged 6 and 4 years respectively with convulsive re current seizures and significant self harm injuries. A total anhidrosis, insen sitivity to pain and mental retardation were then highlighted. Genotyping by analysis of four microsatellite markers surrounding or inside the NTRK1 gene, helped to establish the haplotype of each individual and to follow the transmission of haplotype associated with the disease. Results: the indirect study by genotyping revealed the presence of a homozygous haplotype as sociated with the disease in one of the affected brothers. The second brother died three months later because of septicemia and malignant hyperthermia. Discussion and Conclusion: The interest of the indirect diagnosis by ge notyping is important to show the type of haplotype transmission among patients. This should be followed by sequencing the NTRK1 gene looking for variations. This genetic study of this disease is important for prenatal diagnosis because there is no cure.",2016
25661,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are genetically hete rogeneous motor disorders, divided into pure (pyramidal syndrome) and complicated (additional manifestations). The prevalence and clinical spectrum of SPG31, one of the autosomal dominant HSPs, has not been studied in Spain. AIM: To analyze frequency and phenotype of SPG31 in Spanish HSP patients. METHODS: Through an NGS panel of HSP genes complemented by Sanger sequencing, we analyzed REEP1 in 104 index patients with HSP (51 pure, 50 complicated, 3 unknown) in whom SPAST (SPG4) and ATL1 (SPG3) point mutations had been excluded. Neurological examination and pedigree data were obtained. In order to establish pathogenicity of the variants we chek ked the literature and variant databases, performed in silico predictions and evaluated intrafamilial co segregation. RESULTS: Probably pathogenic variants in REEP1 were observed in 6 pati ents (11.7% among pure HSP without point mutations in SPAST and ATL1). Two were missense variants, two splicing variants, one nonsense, and a 9bp deletion involving REEP1 first three codons. Only one of these variants had been previously reported. We also identified a rare, silent variant of uncer tain significance. All index cases had pure HSP , however cognitive and psych iatric manifestations were present in affected relatives. Onset age was very variable. CONCLUSIONS: SPG31 represents ~12% of pure HSP patients in whom SPG4 and SPG3 have been ruled out by sequencing. This frequency is similar to other countries, and slighly lower than that of SPG3. The variable onset age and clinical spectrum difficult genotype phenotype correlation and ge netic counseling.

ESHG. ORG 196Back to index progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. This study includes the evaluation of a comprehensive spectrum of clinical features and the mu tational screening of the SPG4/SPAST gene in patients with HSP worldwide. Patients and Methods: A large cohort of patients were recruited from Italian, Brazilian, and Japanese populations in a period from 2008 to 2016. Clinical and instrumental functional analyses consisted of neurological assessment and neuroimaging. Mutational screening was carried out by Sanger sequen cing and MLPA analysis. Haplotype studies were also performed. Results: Our study highlights clinical and epidemiological differences among popu lations, showing unique genotype phenotype correlations. Genetic analysis revealed a total of 52 different pathogenic changes in 284 patients: 21 spo radic cases and 263 from 96 families. Among them, six variants were novel and pathogenic. The analysis revealed a great portion of private mutations worldwide and confirmed the founder effect for one recurrent variant in the Italian population. Interestingly, mutations were detected in 21% of spora dic cases and in a range from 16% to 100% of families, depending on the number of affected in the family. Conclusion: This study represents the first worldwide SPG4/SPAST genetic screening on HSP patients. Epidemiological and clinical results broaden the spectrum of the clinical presentations asso ciated with mutations in SPG4/SPAST. Finally, our findings provide evidence that the chance to detect SPG4/SPAST mutations varies proportionally to the number of affected in the family.",2016
25663,"Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a group of clinically and genetical ly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. Lower limb spasticity and progressive weakness are observed in Ã¢ÂÂpureÃ¢ÂÂ HSP patients. In Ã¢ÂÂComplicatedÃ¢ÂÂ HSP , additional neurological and non neurological symptoms are obser ved. HSP can be inherited in autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked manner. 49 loci and 43 genes are associated with autosomal re cessive form of HSP (ARHSP). One patient from each of twenty ARHSP fa milies from Turkey is selected for whole exome sequencing (WES). After the determination of candidate variations, segregation analyses were per formed in the families to confirm that the variation might be responsib le for the HSP phenotype. In three of the families variations were identi fied in known HSP genes and segregation with the disease in the families are confirmed for these variations. Two of them are identified in SPG11 gene and they are c.1235C>G (p. Ser412Ter) variation in family P463 and c.6215_6219dupAGAT (p. Phe2074ArgfsTer15) variation in family H16. The other variation confirmed is c.825T>A (p. Y275X) in CYP7B1 gene in fami ly H98. In eight of the families, various variations in HSP genes have been identified and in seven of the families, variations identified in the genes that are related to other neurological diseases. The segregation analyses are cur rently being performed for these families. For the remaining two families, WES data is still under analysis. With seven novel HSP gene candidates, our WES analysis gives promising preliminary data for identification of novel genes in families from Turkey and it suggests evidence for further genetic heterogeneity in ARHSP .",2016
25664,"Introduction: Molecular diagnosis of HD can be performed confidently using triplet primed PCR (TP PCR) which detects all expanded alleles regardless of size. However, rapid high throughput HD screening strategies currently rely on PCR using primers that flank the repeat, which may fail to detect large expansions and lead to false negative results. We describe an impro ved one step screen for HTT expansion mutations based on MCA of TP PCR products. Materials and Methods: The assay was optimized on 30 genotype known cell line DNAs, and two plasmids pHTT (CAG) 26 and pHTT (CAG)33 were used to establish the threshold temperatures (TTs) distinguishing normal from expanded alleles. A blinded analysis was performed on 69 genotype known clinical samples. Potential effects of reagent variations and common PCR contaminants were also evaluated. Results: All 30 cell line DNAs generated distinct melt peaks and T ms which correlated well with each sampleÃ¢ÂÂs larger allele. The TTs accurately distin guished between samples that carried normal only, intermediate and ex panded alleles. A companion protocol allowed rapid sizing confirmation of screen positive samples, including one carrying a ~175 repeat expansion. Blinded analysis demonstrated clear segregation between unaffected and affected clinical samples (100% analytical sensitivity and specificity). The assay worked well with 10ng to 1ug of input DNA from blood, saliva or buc cal swab. Sodium acetate contamination increased T m, whereas glycogen contamination had no effect. Conclusions: Rapid, accurate, and high throughput detection/exclusion of HD for differentiation from diseases with similar phenotypes can be achie ved using this simple one step screening assay, at one third the cost of fluo rescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis (Ã¢ÂÂ¬1.2/sample).",2016
25665,"Background. Evidence is emerging that ischemic stroke (IS) results from a complex interplay between environmental and genetic risk factors. As he terozygous ABCC6 mutations were shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk, we evaluated the role of ABCC6 in cryptogenic IS. Methodology. Direct sequencing of ABCC6 was performed in 424 consecuti ve cryptogenic IS patients and 250 healthy age and sex matched controls. Allelic frequency differences were analyzed using a two tailed FisherÃ¢ÂÂs Exact test. Logistic regression analysis assessed modification of mutation stroke interaction by cardiovascular risk factors. In one familial case with an au tosomal dominant inheritance pattern of IS, segregation of the identified ABCC6 mutation was studied. Results. Eighteen carriers of one ABCC6 mutation were identified compared to 2 carriers in controls (Odds Ratio 5.4975 [p ,0.023; 95% CI 1.2 23.8]). No interaction with other CV risk factors was confirmed.

The segregation of an ABCC6 mutation in affected members of a multi generation family with cerebrovascular disease suggests ABCC6 mutations to be significant risk factors for IS. This was confirmed by a high incidence of ABCC6 mutations in a cohort of cryptogenic IS patients com pared to controls. As also demonstrated by the diagnosis of two novel PXE patients, identification of ABCC6 mutation carriers can have important im plications for genetic counseling and follow up of these families.",2016

No mutations in the two associated Kabuki genes, KMT2D and KDM6A, were found by direct sequencing and Multiple Ligation Probe Amplification. Array CGH revealed a de novo 5 Mb deletion on chromosome 10p11.22 11.21 encompassing 15 genes. Enrichment ana lysis by Gene Ontology showed that some of the deleted genes (as ZEB1, NRP1, FZD8, PARD3 and ITGB1) play an important role in neurodevelop ment whereas others are implicated in chromatin remodeling. Particularly, the histone modifier EPC1 gene falls within the same Ã¢ÂÂepigenetic functional classesÃ¢ÂÂ of the two candidate Kabuki syndrome genes and it is functionally linked to these by means of H2A histone. Consistent with this finding we de monstrated a significant reduction in EPC1 transcript which should functio nally equate the loss of function mutations associated with the two Kabuki candidate genes.",2016

The clinical onset of the mother was around the age of 18 19 years with scanning speech and gait ataxia. Brain MRI de monstrated cerebellar atrophy at the age of 23 and she has been clinically diagnosed as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). The clinical onset of the sons was much earlier at the age of 2 and 1 years respectively with gait instability. The motor development of the second boy was delayed and independent inassi sted gait has not been achieved since the age of 2.5 years. Neuropsychologi cal development in both children was normal. The neurological examination revealed ataxia of stance and gait, intention tremor, scanning speech. Con vergent strabismus was present in the elder brother. Their brain MRI at the age of 2 showed cerebelar hypotrophy. The following dominant spinocerebellar ataxias SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17, DRPLA were excluded. The genes TTBK2 for SCA11 and PRKCG for SCA14 were tested negative by Sanger sequen cing. The NGS (WES) revealed the mutation c.1268G>A, p. Arg423His in the KCNC3 gene for SCA13. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, it segregated with the disease in the family. SCA13 accounts for less than 1% of SCAs. This mutation has been previous ly published. Typically it is associated with early onset, but in our family the mother showed weaker and late onset manifestation in comparison to both sons.

25668,"The voltage gated Kv10.1 potassium channel, also known as ether a go go related gene 1, encoded by KCNH1 (potassium voltage gated channel, subfa mily H [eag related], member 1) is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Recently, de novo missense KCNH1 mutations have been identified in six patients with Zimmermann Laband syndrome and in four patients with Temple Baraitser syndrome. These syndromes were histori cally considered distinct. Here, we report three de novo missense KCNH1 mutations in four patients with syndromic developmental delay and epi lepsy. Two novel KCNH1 mutations (p. R357Q and p. R357P), found in three patients, were located at the evolutionally highly conserved arginine in the channel voltage sensor domain (S4). Another mutation (p. G496E) was found in the channel pore domain (S6) helix, which acts as a hinge in activation gating and mainly conducts non inactivating outward potassium current. A previously reported p. G496R mutation was shown to produce no voltage dependent outward current in CHO cells, suggesting that p. G496E may also disrupt the proper function of the Kv channel pore. Our report confirms that KCNH1 mutations are associated with syndromic neurodevelopmental dis order, and also support the functional importance of the S4 domain.

Brain MRI revealed Dandy Walker malformation (84%) and hydrocephalus (33%). Abdominal ultrasound revealed unilateral multicystic kidney disease (33%). Basic metabolic, biochemical, haematolo gical work up and aCGH were unremarkable. Whole exome sequencing iden tified previously described homozygous likely pathogenic variant in KCTD3 c.166C>T (p. (Arg56*) by the same research group in a one year old patient with a similar presentation. Discussion: KCTD3 belongs to a family of accessory subunits that regulate the biophysical properties of ion channels. The disruption of this gene has been associated with autism and renal aging in mice. It is highly expressed in the kidney and brain. Complete loss of this gene in the six patients resulted in specific clinical phenotypes mainly affecting brain and kidney develop ment. Conclusion: We report on six patients with recurrent deleterious variants in KCTD3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series of a similar presentation and provides additional observations regarding the role of KCTD3 in brain and kidney development. The universal involvement of cerebellum in those patients with the KCTD3 homozygous mutation make it a new member to the expanding lists of cerebellar hypoplasia associated genes.

We recently identified the recessive founder mutation responsible for PEHO syndrome in Finnish patients (Anttonen et al., in revision). Langlois et al. (Eur J Hum Genet 2015) reported that PEHO syndrome is caused by de novo dominant variants in the motor domain of the KIF1A gene. In our exome study of 33 PEHO like patients negative for the PEHO founder mutation we identified one patient with a de novo missense variant (c.757G>A;p.

Our patient presented with progressi ve cerebellar atrophy, optic atrophy and dysmorphic features quite similar to PEHO syndrome. In thorough evaluation of the imaging findings in diffe rent time points, the dysmyelination was more severe in this patient than in typical PEHO patients. Thus, the patient was concluded to have PEHO like features. Our findings, combined with analysis of data on patients reported in the lite rature to have likely pathogenic variants affecting the motor domain coding region of KIF1A imply that de novo mutations in KIF1A are associated with a PEHO like phenotype rather than PEHO syndrome.",2016

Additional fin dings can also be observed including heart defects, renal/urologic defects, genital defects in males, severe respiratory infections, autistic like features in childhood, epilepsy,... The syndrome can be caused either by a submicro scopic 9q34.3 deletion or an intragenic haploinsufficiency mutation of the euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) gene. We report here, the first 3 years old boy of non consanguineous parents, with severe ID, hypotonia, facial dysmorphism, cardiac defect, severe respi ratory infection and infantile spasms (IS).

A substantial proportion of practically all morphologi cal forms has been associated with a wide variety of isolated or syndromal monogenic disorders. Method: Conventional Sanger sequencing and CNV analysis by MLPA, more recently massive parallel NGS gene panel sequening (MGPS), additional neu roradiological assessment of available cerebral MR (cMR) imaging. Results: Conventional Sanger sequencing with MLPA in our laboratory al lowed a genetic classification (mutation class VUS4 or VUS5) for 21.6% of our overall NMD patient cohort (981 independent patients with lissen cephaly/pachygyria/polymicrogyria, double cortex, periventricular nodular heterotopia or complex NMD; 1.53 genes per patient).

Implementation of an individual combined diagnostic strategy including massive parallel NGS gene panel sequencing MGPS (45.8 genes per patient) and neuroradiological assessment of patients with NMD now allows not only a substantially faster and more cost effective workup, but also further increases the diagnostic yield through detection of mutations in genes with small contribution (e.g. DYNC1H1 or TREX1) and by screening for copy number variations (e.g. LIS1) for all tested genes within the known current technical limitations. Furthermore, sufficient MGPS coverage also increases the sensitivity to detect somatic mosaicism (e.g. DCX).Summary: Our preliminary findings indicate a benefit of diagnostic MGPS for NMD, when combined with critical data assessment and interpretation in the context of individual clinical and neuroradiological findings.",2016

Genetic studies have identified 15 (MCPH) causative genes which include MCPH1, WDR62, CDK5RAP2, CASC5, ASPM, CENPJ, STIL, CEP135, CEP152, ZNF335, PHC1, CDK6, CENPE, SASS6 and MFSD2A. Physiologically, most of the prote in products of these MCPH genes are involved in cell cycle and its regulation. Methods: The genomic analysis was performed through whole exome se quencing, while co segregation of the identified pathogenic variants in the corresponding family members was carried out by sanger DNA sequencing. Results: In the present genetic study, we present three consanguineous Pakistani families segregating primary microcephaly that are ascertained from the rural area of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Sequence analysis of two families revealed one novel [NM_018136.4: c.10013delA (p. Asp3338Valfs*2)] and a previously reported [NM_018136.4: c.9730C>T (p. Arg3244*)] mutation in ASPM gene. The novel frame shift mutation (p. Asp3338Valfs*2) in ASPM presumably truncate the protein synthesis that result in loss of armadillo type fold domain. The third family showed the same missense mutation [NM_001259.6: c.589G A (p. Ala197Thr)] in CDK6 gene as recently identified in a single Pakistani family.

It usually affects boys, but also there are girls affected. Duplication could be de novo or inherited from asymptomatic carrier mother. It has been reported about 120 cases all over the world, wi thout a known incidence. The aim of the study is to characterize a Spanish cohort with MECP2 dupli cation syndrome to improve our knowledge of the disease and perform a genotype phenotype correlation. Material and Method: The cohort consists in 13 patients of both sexes dia gnosed in different Spanish hospitals. The duplications were detected by MLPA and/or CGH array. The clinical characterization was carried out using a checklist designed for the project. The molecular characterization is di vided into several steps: 1) Checking the duplication by qPCR doses, stu dy XCI and FISH; 2) If FISH shows tandem duplication, we narrowed the breakpoints through qPCR, PCR long and Sanger sequencing; 3) Analyze the expression of the two MeCP2 isoforms by RT qPCR. Results: In this collaborative study has been characterized a heterogeneous cohort, with both sexes, with different phenotypes (Rett like and duplicati on patients) and inherited or de novo duplication located in different regi ons (tandem, other region of ChrX or ChrY).

Work over the past decade has demonstrated a crucial role of epigenetic mechanisms in driving long lasting changes in gene expression in several tissues, including the brain. Material and methods: Starting from a previously reported list of 2,878 SNPs that correlate with differential levels of methylation at CpG sites (allele specific methylation), we obtained a sub list of 88 SNPs using the following selection criteria: R2>0.5, only one SNP for each CpG site. Subse quently, we evaluated the possible contribution to drug dependence predis position of these SNPs in a sample of 697 drug dependent patients and 656 sex matched controls from Spain and in a replication sample. Results: A single SNP , rs3766612, was found associated with drug addiction (p value,0.00071; OR 95%CI,1.41 (1.16 1.69)) and survived the Bonferro ni correction for multiple testing. We then aimed at replicating this finding in a follow up sample of 740 drug dependent patients and 771 sex matched controls, but rs3766612 was not found associated with drug addiction.

25677,"Introduction: MSTO1 protein has been localized to mitochondria and linked to mitochondrial morphology but its specific role remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of MSTO1 on mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in patient derived fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Methods: The whole exome sequencing was performed a Hungarian family with mitochondrial disease resulting in myopathy, hypoacusis and psychia tric symptoms. The mitochondrial fusion fission and bioenergetics in both patient derived cells and cell lines using genetic rescue and gene silencing were investigated by live cell imaging, fluorometric measurements and im munoblotting. Results: In this study, we identified a c.22 G>A, (p. Val8Met) mutation of MSTO1 in our patients. In the patient fibroblasts, the MSTO1 mRNA and pro tein abundance is decreased, mitochondria show fragmentation, aggregati on, decreased network continuity and fusion activity. These can be reversed by genetic rescue. Short term silencing of MSTO1 in HeLa cells reproduced the impairment of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics observed in the patient fibroblasts without impairing bioenergetics. Contrary to a previous report, MSTO1 is mainly localized in the cytoplasmic area and shows only partial colocalization with the mitochondria. After plasma membrane per meabilization, MSTO1 is released to the cytoplasm.

Despite efforts, even large genome wide asso ciation studies (GWAS) failed to completely explain heritability of MS based on common genetic variation. To characterize the possible role of rare, highly penetrant genetic variants in MS, we performed whole exome sequencing in 48 patients with familial MS, 40 patients with sporadic MS and 92 population matched controls. We have focused the analysis to rare (<5%) and predicted pathogenic variants (trun cating or predicted pathogenic missense variants) in 102 genes associated with MS in the most recent GWAS performed to date. In the subset of patients with familial MS, we identified two novel truncating variants of high impact in MMEL1 and ALPK2 genes. Truncating variants in two further GWAS genes IL7R and AHI1 were also identified in sporadic MS cases. Several predicted pathogenic missense variants were also identified in MS associated genes: 18 variants in familial MS cases and 27 in spora dic cases. Finally, we could also demonstrate an increased burden of rare predicted pathogenic variants in GWAS genes in both familial (OR,1.77, p,0.048) and sporadic MS cases (OR,2.5, p,0.0003), when comparing this load to the population of healthy controls. Our results suggest the possible role of rare pathogenic variants in genes previously associated with MS in association studies. Furthermore, we re port an increased overall burden of pathogenic variants within these genes in familial and sporadic cases with MS.",2016
25680,"Introduction: Increased local iron concentration in brain parenchyma of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is documented by magnetic resonance im aging, but role of iron in MS etiopathogenesis is still debated. Brain iron ho meostasis is regulated by different factors, among which the transferrin and hemochromatosis proteins seem to play a key role. The aim of study was to investigate weather HFE (C282Y, H63D), TF (P570S) and transferrin recep tor (TFRC S142G) gene variants contribute to MS development. Materials and Methods: We genotyped 455 patients diagnosed with MS according to the revised McDonald criteria and 400 healthy controls from Croatia and Slovenia by PCR RFLP or Real time PCR method. Results: A significantly higher frequency of the C282Y carrier mutation was observed in MS patients (6.3%) than in controls (3.1%) (P,0.033). Allele and genotypes frequencies for other polymorphisms did not differ sig nificantly (P>0.05). A three year earlier onset was found in carriers of the C282Y mutation (P,0.106), and significantly earlier onset in TF C2 homo zygotes (P,0,016). Disease began eight year later in H63D homozygotes but statistical difference show borderline significance (P,0.056). Progression index of MS was higher in carrier of TFRC S142G A allele also with border line significance (P,0.051). Conclusions: Our results indicate that HFE C282Y mutation may be risk factor to MS susceptibility. Variants C282Y and TF C2 are possible predic tors for early onset of MS, while HFE H63D prolong disease onset. Polymor phism TFRC S142G might have influence on disease progression. Polymor phisms in HFE, TFRC and TF genes coding for iron binding and transporting proteins might contribute to pathogenesis of MS.",2016
25681,"Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a heterogeneous group of inherited neurologic disorders characterized by progressive move ment disorders and abnormal accumulation of iron in brain, specifically in the basal ganglia. Mostly affected are children in whom the progress of the disease is devastating and includes progressive slurred speech, dysphagia, dystonia, spasticity, parkinsonism, pure akinesia, oculomotor dysfunction, loss of vision and neuropsychiatric symptoms. There are 10 genes causing NBIA that resolve 80% of cases; the remaining patients are cataloged as idiopathic cases. The NBIA causing genes play a role in multiple biological processes such as iron metabolism, mitochondrial dynamics, reactive oxy gen species (ROS) induced damage, lipid metabolism and autophagy. Our aim is the genetic characterization of patients with NBIA in Spanish popu lation. To establish the genetic basis of these patients we have analyzed the most common genes (PANK2 , PLA2G6, WDR45 and C19orf12 ) responsible for the disease by Sanger sequencing and Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Am plification (MLPA) in a clinical series of 57 patients diagnosed with NBIA. To date we have achieved the molecular diagnosis for 40 NBIA patients : 31 patients carry mutations in PANK2 , and 9 patients in PLA2G6. Eleven of the se mutations are novel and functional studies are in progress with the aim to demonstrate its pathogenicity. No mutations were identified in the C19orf12 or WDR45 genes. We currently study the remaining six NBIA genes in the patients who remain undiagnosed by targeted next generation sequencing.",2016

The goal of this study is to establish the genetic aetiology of 100 adult patients affected by dual diagnosis of mild (IQ,75 50) or moderate (IQ,50 35) ID and psychiatric/behavioural disor der. Different tests were used to evaluate cognitive and psychiatric profile. Patients were analyzed with a sequential genetic workflow, including mole cular karyotype (array CGH Agilent Technologies, 400K). Customized MLPA and FISH analyses were used to validate and determine the inheritance of pathogenic copy number variants (pCNV) and variants of unknown signi ficance likely pathogenic (VOUSp).We identified a genetic abnormality in 38 patients: 14 well known specific syndromes, 4 cases with chromosomal rearrangements and 20 cases with CNVs (8 pCNV and 12 VOUSp).

25683,"Introduction: The incidence of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL; CLN) in different countries vary between 0.5 3.9/100.000. NCLs are characterized by the intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material in different patterns ultrastructurally. NCLs are clinically and genetically a heterogeneous group of neurodegene rative disorders. Originally, they were classified broadly according to age at onset. However with the identification of molecular defects, the NCLs are now classified numerically according to the underlying gene defect. NCL2 refers to NCL caused by mutation in the CLN2 gene (TPP1), regardless of the age at onset. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is fairly quick and to a low cost compa red with old methods when sequencing many genes simultaneously. Exome sequencing is a technique for sequencing all the protein coding genes in a genome. It is also possible to filter out and investigate for only the genes of interest. Methods: A five year old girl developed early sleep problems that abated and during second year of life speech problems having only few words. From three years of age she had seizures, frequent falls, sleep problems and emo tional stress. Her 14 months old brother had sleep problems and cries. Results: Filtered NGS exome for CLN genes identified a compound hete rozygous mutation in the TPP1 gene, i.e. NM_000391.3 c.509 1G>A and c.622C>T p.(Arg208*) consistent with the disorder NCL2.Conclusion: These two variants have never been described together causing NCL2.Filtered NGS exome is a powerful, cost and time effective tool to investigate all known genes causing NCLs.

25684,"Introduction: Neuroticism is a moderately heritable personality trait consi dered to be a risk factor for stress and impaired health as well as psychiatric disorders. Our aim in this study is to test whether neuroticism is associated with brain volumes and to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated to the neuroticism related brain volumes. Materials and Methods: In this study, we combined genetics, imaging and personality data obtained from 123 women between the ages of 21 64 from Kangbuk Samsung Cohort Study. A total of 5,862,302 SNPs were tested for association with brain volume in a genome wide association study. We also investigated if the identified SNPs are operating as a eQTL and in which brain region using Braineac web based resource. Results: High neurotic individuals showed increased volumes in precuneus, superior parietal lobule, middle frontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus. None of the genetic markers reached genome wide significance. However, SNPs near ADSS for superior parietal lobule, within RBFOX1 for middle fron tal gyrus, within KCNH8 for superior frontal gyrus were showed suggestive p values (< 1*10 5). The genes were previously reported to be associated with neurological phenotypes. Furthermore, allelic differences in the SNPs were associated with differential mRNA expression in the cis acting region.

25685,"Background: N glycanase 1 is a conserved cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the deglycosylation of misfolded N linked glygoproteins, an essential step in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway (ERAD). N glycanase 1 deficiency, caused by loss of function mutations in the NGYL1 gene, is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by global developmental delay, movement disorder, hypotonia, liver dysfunc tion, and alacrima. To our knowledge, a total of 14 patients have been repor ted in the literature thus far. Methods: We investigated a 23 month old girl who presented with seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, and hyperkinetic movement disorder. We performed whole Exome Sequencing (WES) in the patient and her parents using the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome kit (37 Mb) and the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina). Results: We identified compound heterozygous mutations in the NGLY1 gene: a nonsense mutation c. A1201A>T (p. Arg401*) inherited from the mo ther, and a splicing mutation c.1150 1G>C (p.?) inherited from the father. The nonsense mutation c. A1201A>T is the most common deleterious allele identified in patients with N glycanase 1 deficiency. The splicing mutati on c.1150 1G>C is novel and we show that it leads to an in frame deletion (p. Asp335_Val384del) that removes part of the transglutaminase like (cata lytic) domain of the protein. Conclusion: We report here an additional patient with compound heterozy gous mutations in the NGLY1 gene detected by WES.

25686,"ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, clinical ly characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity. Key neuropathological substrate of PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia and presence of intraneuronal Lewy bodies. Vaste majority of PD cases have multifactor etiology but in 10 15% patients monogenic pattern of inheritance is noticeable, with familiar occurrence and/or early onset of disease. In the past decades at least 18 PARK disease causing and suscepti bility loci have been identified, but genetic basis of PD is not fully clarified. Recent Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods have their application in this field also. We describe here results of NGS implementation in five PD families from Serbia. These patients have been previously screened for the most common mutations in PARK loci (LRRK2, PARKIN, PINK1, DJ1, GBA, VPS35) by direct sequencing of target regions and MLPA method. NGS was performed on Illumina MiSeq platform using TruSight One panel. Af ter bioinformatic analysis of NGS data we detected novel TGM6 c.1076C>T (p. Pro359Leu) variant in early onset PD family with three affected members in two consecutive generations. Mutations in TGM6 usually cause spinoce rebellar ataxia type SCA35, but it has previously been shown that mutations in other SCA genes are clinically present with PD. In another PD family NGS revealed previously detected susceptibility variant N370S in GBA gene. In the remaining PD families NGS did not reveal significant pathogenic vari ants.

Adult onset NPC has neuropsychiatric manifestations that can mimic several neu rodegenerative diseases. Aim: Multicenter, transversal study to screen for NPC in adult patients with undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorders. Materials and Methods: 1) Patient selection through retrospective revision of clinical records in neurology departments from Galicia (Spain). 2) Major inclusion criteria: progressive gait disorder, involuntary movements, su pranuclear gaze palsy and cognitive decline. Secondary criteria: prolonged neonatal jaundice, visceral involvement, psychiatric symptoms, epilepsy, cataplexy and family history. 3) A Next Generation Sequencing panel was designed for Ion PGMÃÂ® using AmpliSeqÃÂ® Designer program with 99.8% co verage of NPC1 and NPC2. 4) Biochemical and cellular tests were performed in patients with suspected genetic variants. Results: Eighteen patients (13 men, 5 women, ages 22 66) were included. Altogether, we identified five potentially pathogenic variants in NPC1 and one in NPC2. The diagnosis of NPC was confirmed in two cases with homo zygous NPC1 mutations). One patient carrying only one splicing variant had a late disease onset and intermediate Filipin test result. Two patients had variants of as yet uncertain significance. Conclusions: NPC should be considered in adults with neuropsychiatric disorders of unclear etiology. Analysis of gene panels via NGS provides an efficient diagnostic strategy. Genetic confirmation facilitates detection of additional family cases, allows early treatment and genetic counseling.

Background: Deletions or mutations of neurexin 1 (NRXN1) remain a dif ficult counselling issue because of reduced penetrance and variable expres sivity. We have reviewed 33 families known to our center to estimate pen etrance and document the phenotype. Method: Cases were identified by database review within our center or through collaboration with colleagues. Genomic data, clinical phenotype & family history information was extracted and analyzed. Penetrance was calculated using the method proposed by Kirov et al, 2014. The unaffected carriers were used as controls. Results: We identified 53 NRXN1 deletion carriers and one individual with a point mutation of whom 37(69%) had a definite phenotype. 33 were pro bands and the rest were first degree relatives. 87% of probands were in vestigated because of unexplained developmental delay mostly speech and language or learning difficulties and 63% had Autism. 17/53 were intronic deletions. The overall penetrance was ~66% for any phenotype and 40% for Autism. Congenital anomalies were reported in 7 infants and seizures in 6. Conclusion: Our data suggest that neurexin 1 deletions present with a vari able phenotype and are not fully penetrant. Intronic deletions are patho genic .Whilst, a parent that carries the deletion has a 50% risk of passing it on, the risk of a child with the deletion developing Autism is approximately 40%.Genetic counselling remains problematic as the additional factors that trig ger the phenotype are unclear and impossible to predict.

25689,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric condition that affects 1 3% of the population worldwide. It is listed as the tenth most disabling illnesses of any kind. Family and twin studies demonstrated that OCD involves both environmental and polygenic risk factors. However, de spite an abundance of candidate genes, linkage studies and GWAS, there has been very little progress towards elucidating the genetic causes of this dis order. This project represents a novel strategy that will contribute to explain the aetiology of OCD. We performed whole exome sequencing of 306 unrelated OCD cases follo wed by a rare variant association study. Specifically, we aggregated exonic non synonymous and splicing variants into genes and tested for association with OCD using a group of control exomes from our in house database. We accounted for minor allele frequencies (prioritizing rare variants) and pa thogenicity score. After implementing this study, we identified a list of genes harbouring a higher number of mutations in cases compared to controls. We then implemented a partial least square analysis to identify combinations of mutated genes that can distinguish between OCD cases and controls. We also performed a pathway enrichment analysis with the significant genes, finding enriched pathways related with brain neurodevelopment or func tion. Finally, we selected some of these genes for further analysis, including functional studies of the identified variants. Stronger evidence of association for the significant genes identified will be obtained through replication in larger cohorts of OCD. This work was supported by MINECO project SAF2013 49108 R. L.

The lifetime prevalence of OCD has been estimated to approximately 2% and, despite molecular studies have identified several relevant genes, much additional research is needed to establish definitive causes of the condition. In this study we tried to identify copy number variations (CNVs) conferring risk of OCD. We have performed exome sequencing on 306 OCD cases and more than 1000 non OCD samples (control as well as other non psychiatric disorders). Both NimbleGen and Agilent commercial exome capture kits were used for sequencing. In order to identify CNVs, we analyzed the data with ClinCNV (an in house pipeline for CNV detection from exome data). Currently, we have performed the CNV calls in the OCD samples and are analyzing the re maining samples. In the OCD cases, we identified an average of 33 CNV per individual, ran ging in size from 1 kb to 3,5 Mb. Some of the detected variants were over lapping with known common CNVs. Some rare variants included relevant genes involved in psychiatric disorders. We will perform this analysis in the non OCD samples and follow up with association analysis and validation of relevant regions by direct typing in these and additional samples.

25693," Introduction: DJ 1 (PARK7) codifies a chaperone with protease activity involved in stress response, particularly under oxidative conditions. This protein is also involved in mitochondria homeostasis, in collaboration with Parkin and PINK1. Mutations in this gene have been associated to autoso mal recessive Parkinson disease. In our group, genetic studies in a Basque population have shown a positive association of two single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) near an area of alternative splicing in the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR of DJ 1. Here we intend to determine how these SNPs affect the expression of the gene and if they affect the isoform ratio. Material and methods: We used the exon trapping assay modified for exon 1, which does not contains naturally a splicing acceptor site. The quantifica tion of the splicing forms was performed by RT qPCR. To study the effect of the variants of the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR in gene expression regulation, we used constructs with luciferase under the control of SV40 promoter and the different forms of the 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR of DJ 1. All the plasmids were transfected in SHSY 5Y cell line differentiated to dopaminergic neuronal phenotype, checking the differen tiation by determination of the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and by cell morphology. Results: Preliminary studies show that the different alleles of these SNPs affect the ratio of the different splicing forms, and therefore the expression of the gene. Conclusions: Two SNPs were found as associated to Parkinson disease in this population and the genotypes associated to the disease alter the correct expression of DJ 1.

Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) gene encodes a pro tein which is expressed in microglial cells and this protein is also expressed in the central nervous system. Two distinct polymorphisms (374T>A, 429T>C and 63 bp Ins/Del polymorphisms) affect the RAGE expression. G82S polymorphism occurs as result of transition of serine in preference to glycine at the 82nd of the RAGE gene. The resulting polymorphic changes show an increase in ligand binding and downstream signaling. The present study aims to investigate the relationship of 429T>C, 374T>A, 82G>S and 63 bp Ins/Del polymorphisms with PD. A total of 174 PD patients and 150 healthy matched individuals in Turkish population were registe red.

Primer walking defined rearrangement junctions in introns 5 and 7, and identified the ends of the 7812 bp duplication. Consistently, an aberrant PDCD10 minor transcript with a 245 bp insertion, corresponding to duplicated exons 6 7, was identi fied by cDNA amplification. Discussion: Duplication of PDCD10 exons 6 7 causes a frameshift and a pre mature stop codon (p. Asp133Leufs*14) that results in a loss of function allele. Therefore, this novel mechanism should be taken into account when performing mutation screening in CCM.",2016
25698,"Introduction: Mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan biosynthesis class N (PIGN) gene are causing defects in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway. Problems in this pathway are associated with multiple autosomal recessive disorders, often involving the central nervous system. Mutations in PIGN are causing Ã¢ÂÂmultiple congenital anoma lies hypotonia seizures syndrome 1Ã¢ÂÂ (MACHS1).Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing was performed in an 12 year old child from non consanguineous parents from Belgian/Peruvian origin. The girl presented with early onset hypotonia and developmental delay. She had dysmorphic features including a flat nasal bridge and prominent nose. Over the years she remained severely delayed and hypotonic with choreo atheto tic movements and generalized epilepsy, responsive to treatment. ERG was abnormal. The MRI of the brain showed progressive cortical atrophy. Results: Exome sequencing showed the presence of biallelic variants, c.1158delG, p. Leu386Phefs*17 and c. T956G, p. Val319Gly in the PIGN gene (RefSeq: NM_012327.5) as Sanger sequencing analysis of the parents sho wed the independent segregation of the two observed alterations. Conclusions: Exome sequencing showed the presence of two novel changes in the PIGN gene causing MACHS1. The c. T956G alteration is predicted to be pathogenic (SIFT score 0 and PolyPhen score 0.986); while c.1158delG change is completely disrupting the protein. Consequently, MACHS1 in this patient has been confirmed.",2016
25699,"PMs are rare autosomal recessive disorders with a cumulate incidence from 1/10.000 to 1/100.000 births, depending on geographic origin. Five groups of PM are usually distinguished: MicroCephaly, Primitive Hereditary, prima ry microcephaly with chorioretinopathy, and primary microcephalic dwar fisms: Seckel syndrome, microcephalic osteodysplastic dwarfism type 2, and Meier Gorlin syndrome. PMs are characterized by an occipito frontal head circumference more than 2 SD below the mean for sex, age, and ethnicity at birth, and at least below 3 SD after six months. PMs result from mutations in more than 30 genes, considerably complicating molecular diagnostics. Therefore, due to the great clinical and genetic heterogeneity, two third to one half of PM patients have no identified gene mutation. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 205Back to index Mutation screening was performed in 450 patients with PM by targeted San ger sequencing, panel gene NGS or exome sequencing. Causative mutations were found in 86 patients (19%).The majority of mutations were found in ASPM (34/86), followed by WDR62 (10/86) and MCPH1 (10/86). We also identified mutations in a further 19 genes (CDK5RAP2, CEP152, CEP135, PCNT , STIL, CENPJ, TUBGCP6, EFTUD2, TUBGCP4, RNU4ATAC, CIT , WDR81, DYRK1A, LIG4, RECQL3, MECP2, TUBA1A, KIF11 and PHGDH ). Furthermo re, by exome sequencing, we highlight some unexpected diagnoses, missed because the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype lacks the typical clinical picture. With mutations found in more than 20 genes, this study illustrates the ex treme genetic heterogeneity of PMs. Due to phenotypic heterogeneity and atypical clinical presentation in some cases, exome sequencing for targeted gene panel negative patients is an efficient strategy to improve the diagnosis yield.",2016
25700,"Introduction: We recently identified two missense mutations (p. I196V; p. G13D) in RAB12 in patients with musicianÃ¢ÂÂs dystonia (MD) by exome and genome sequencing. RAB12 encodes a small GTPase that has been linked to lysosomal degra dation of the transferrin receptor (TfR). TfR regulates the mitochondrial network integrity via a signaling pathway involving Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). We investigated the effect of RAB12 mutations on this pathway. Materials and methods: For functional characterization of RAB12 mutants, we used three different cellular models: 1) fibroblasts of two MD patients carrying I196V, 2) fibroblasts of healthy subjects overexpressing RAB12 wildtype (WT), G13D, and I196V, and 3) SH SY5Y cells also overexpressing RAB12 WT , G13D, and I196V. GTPase activity, subcellular RAB12 localiza tion, TfR degradation, Mfn2 protein levels, and the mitochondrial network were investigated. Results: Elevated GTPase activity was detected in both mutants. Immu nofluorescent staining revealed colocalization of ectopically expressed RAB12 with lysosomes and an altered subcellular distribution of both RAB12 mutants. There was no significant effect on TfR degradation or Mfn2 levels under basal conditions. However, we detected a reduction of Mfn2 in the G13D mutant compared to WT upon induction of oxidative stress. Fi nally, increased branching of the mitochondrial network was observed in fibroblasts overexpressing mutated RAB12 (I196V>G13D) compared to WT . Conclusion: Mutations in RAB12 lead to an altered protein function as de monstrated by changes in GTPase activity, subcellular localization of RAB12, and mitochondrial network. The mitochondrial integrity may be disturbed in mutant cells independently of TfR degradation. This study was supported by the DFG (LO 1555/4 1).",2016
25701,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a sleep related sensory motor disorder, is characterized by an irresistible desire to move the legs because of abnormal sensations, induced in the evening by rest or inactivity and are partially re lieved by movement. This common disorder has a prevalence of up to 15% in western populations. A successful GWAS on RLS patients identified common variants in intron 8 MEIS1 and intergenic region between MAP2K5/SKOR1 genes associated with RLS. These results were also replicated by other inde pendent studies. Our group subsequently showed that MEIS1 risk haplotype is associated with decreased mRNA and protein expression of this gene. We examined the SKOR1 mRNA expression in patient cells with the MEIS1 risk haplotype using q RT PCR. A significant decrease in SKOR1 mRNA expres sion level was observed. A luciferase reporter assay using SKOR1 promoter region in HeLa cells with down regulated MEIS1 expression (using siRNA), followed by an EMSA using three fragments of SKOR1 promoter region was performed. The results suggest a direct interaction between MEIS1 and SKOR1. Given the transcriptional regulatory function of these genes, we are overexpressing or knocking out MEIS1 and SKOR1 genes, separately in hu man cell lines. Whole transcriptome of these sets of cells as well as control cells with normal endogenous expression of the genes will be extracted to perform RNA Seq experiment. We believe that differential expression analy sis of RNA Seq data will lead to identify the genes that are in fact regulated by these transcription factors, some of which might have direct roles in RLS pathological pathways.",2016
25702,"Introduction: It has been studied patients with clinical Rett (RTT) without genetic diagnosis using the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). This type of diseases requires clinical diagnosis. The finding of a mutation confirms the diagnosis, but not necessarily established it. NGS using targeted panel of genes facilitates the simultaneous study of cau sative genes of RTT and others whose mutation produces a similar or over lapping clinic, such Pitt Hopkins and Ohtahara syndromes. Material and Methods: It has been designed a gene panel of 17 genes related to the clinical RTT like presentation by HaloPlex Target technology. Enrich ment System, for Illumina Sequencing. Sanger sequencing was used in exons not well covered. If do not find any change, MLPA was done by causative RTT genes. Results: We have detected mutations in genes that do not cause RTT patho logy in 14 of 187 studied patients with clinical Rett like. A total of 8 patients presented mutations in STBX1 gene, related with Ohtahara syndrome and 6 patients were redirected as a Pitt Hopkins, finding mutations in causative TCF4 gene. The database HGMD professional, dbSNP , 1000 G and predictions pathology programs (Polyphen 2.0 and SIFT) were consulted. NGS variants have been verified by Sanger sequencing and studied the ori gin of the mutation in the parents. Conclusion: The genetic study by NGS allows to study a larger number of genes associated with RTT simultaneously, redirecting genetic diagnosis to other syndromes.

25703,"Introduction: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a developmental disorder of early on set, genetic basis, dominant inheritance and X linked. There are described three genes that cause RTT: MECP2, CDKL5 and FOXG1. However, the etio logy of 15% of RTT patients still remains unknown. Thus, the aim of this project is to identify new candidate genes in a cohort of patients with RTT phenotype without genetic diagnosis by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). Material and Method: The patient and healthy parents without genetic dia gnosis and negative CGHarray Cytoarray Plus (180K) (Agilent Microarrays) were analyzed by WES with TruSeq Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). The filtering criteria used were: search mutations with 1000g MAF below 0.05 in genes with dominant inheritance, de novo, X linked, autosomal subject to imprinting and/or with functional impact in the CNS. For the validated mu tations in genes related with gabaergic pathways (SLC6A1 and GABBR2), we performed RT qPCR (TaqMan Gene Expression) and Western Blotting assay of RNA and protein extraction from peripheral blood. Results: Most of the validated mutations are genes expressed in the cen tral nervous system: ion channels and GABA/glutamate/acetylcholine pa thways. The preliminary studies of the SLC6A1 and GABBR2 expression were not conclusive. Conclusions: We do not only identify 1 gene which causes RTT like pheno type. Pathway of genes has to be address to understand overlapping pheno type, instead to one disease only. Although blood tissue has convenient ex traction, we cannot detect RNA and protein of these genes. Our next studies are performing RT qPCR and Western Blotting assays with RNA and protein extraction from fibroblasts.",2016
25704,"Sporadic AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (SAD) is a multi factorial disease caused by genetic, epigenetic, environmental and metabolic factors. Current under standings of the possible mechanisms of AD such as inflammation and oxidative stresses in the brain have led us to investigation of potential AD therapeutics. Currently herbal medicines with few side effects are in the point of attention. Melilotus officinalis is a herbal extract with possible role as an anti inflammatory and anti oxidant agent that can improve the blood circulation. Among genes that have been implicated in SAD, eight genes in cluding Daxx, Nfkb, Vegf, Syp, Psen1, Mapk3, Mtap2 and Tnf ÃÂ± have shown significant statistical diversity in Alzheimer human brain and STZ rat model. With this knowledge these genes have been chosen to be investigated for neuroprotective effect of Melilotus officinalis extract.

25705,"Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 16 (SCAR16) is a rare progres sive neurologic disorder characterized by truncal and limb ataxia resulting in gait instability. We studied a consanguineous family with three affected siblings presenting with cerebellar ataxia as the main and initial features plus variable other features. The age of onset was 57 years for the male and 31 and 37 for the females. All patients showed marked cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Further, clinical signs of pyramidal tract damage with increased lo wer limb tendon reflexes were observed, but no Babinski response, ankle clonus, lower limb spasticity or hypogonadism was evident. The females were unable to walk whereas the male had only moderate walking disabili ty. One of the females had a relatively more progressive disease course and additionally cognitive impairment and nystagmus. Homozygosity mapping on three patients followed by exome sequencing on one patient revealed a novel homozygous c.*240T>C variant in the 3Ã¢ÂÂ UTR of STUB1 gene. The vari ant is absent in all public databases, is highly conserved among species and most likely disrupts the polyadenylation signal in the mRNA, as indicated by online tool DNA Poly(A) Signal Miner. In contrast to the previous reports, our findings show that STUB1 ataxia can start even after age 50, and neit her hypogonadism nor spasticity is an obligatory feature. Also, the family is a rare example of a neurologic disease with more severe manifestation in females.

25706,"Introduction: At least 11 rare copy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to be major risk factors for schizophrenia. These CNVs also increase risk for other early onset neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs). We hypo thesised that additional CNVs associated with NDs are likely to be hitherto undiscovered schizophrenia risk factors. Methods: We analysed 50 ND CNVs that have not been associated with schi zophrenia in a new sample of 6,934 schizophrenia cases and 8,751 controls, combined with previously published datasets, for a total of 20,403 schizo phrenia cases and 26,628 controls. Results: Collectively, these ND CNVs were significantly enriched for schizo phrenia. (P,1.01 ÃÂ 10 6, OR,1.90). 19 CNVs have increased ORs for schi zophrenia, compared to only 4 with ORs < 1, and no observations were made among cases or controls at the remaining 27 loci. For individual loci, 16p12.1 deletions are significantly associated with schizophrenia risk af ter correction for multiple testing (case rate,0.16%, control rate,0.045%, q value,0.017, OR,3.3). Two additional new loci reached nominal le vels of statistical significance (deletions at 2q11.2 and duplications at 10q11.21q11.23). Our results suggest a large proportion of the 50 loci are likely to be novel risk factors for schizophrenia, but due to their rarity, the available sample size precludes statistical confirmation. Additionally, ana lysis of our new dataset alone provides independent support for the 11 known schizophrenia risk loci. Conclusions: We provide evidence for the existence of additional schizo phrenia CNV loci, identify deletions of 16p12.1 as a novel schizophrenia risk factor, and strengthen the support for an aetiological overlap between neu rodevelopmental disorders.",2016
25707,"Introduction: According to the hypothesis of neurodevelopment of schi zophrenia, the causes of the pathology are hidden in early stages of brain development, long before the disease manifestation. The idea that mother bears genetic predisposition to the development of different fetal anoma lies due to various complications of pregnancy can explain the link between these unfavorable maternal situations and development of schizophrenia in progeny. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 207Back to index Materials and Methods: The aim of our research was to compare polymor phic allele rates of inflammation: TNFÃÂ± ( 308 G/A), IL 6 ( 174G/C), detoxi cation: GSTM1 (del), GSTT1(del), CYP1A1 (6235 T/C), CYP2E1 ( 1019C/T), methylation: (MTHFR (677C/T), COMT (Val158Met), DNMT3b ( 149C/T) genes in mothers of healthy and suffering from schizophrenia persons. 158 mothers of patients and 82 mothers with healthy progeny were studied by PCR RFLP .Results: Significant differences in the distribution of COMT and IL 6 alle les were revealed between two groups. For the mothers of patients val val/COMT (OR,3,82; rs4680) and gc/IL 6 (OR,3,13; CI: 1.5829 6.1825; rs1800795) were proved to be risk genotypes; val/COMT (OR,2,31; CI: 1.4275 to 3,7552) and w1/CYP1A1 (OR,2,27; CI: 1.1515 to 4.4586; rs 4646903) were elucidated as risk alleles. Also the genotype combinations frequencies of functionally different genes varied significantly in examined maternal groups. Conclusions: These results support the general hypothesis that connects the predisposition to schizophrenia with the anomalies during the prenatal development of nervous system. Possibly, processes of inflammation, deto xication and methylation, biochemically interconnected and determined in the maternal genome, can guide the peculiarities of fetal neurodevelopment that later enhance the risk of mental disorder .",2016

25709," Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with an estima ted heritability of approximately 60 80%. So far, only a small proportion of its underlying genetic risk factors have been identified. In the search for new risk factors, the analysis of multiply affected families is a very promising approach. Here, we present the first exome sequencing study in multiply affected families with SCZ from Indonesia. In each of the nine families, three to five genetically distant individuals were exome sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500. For the data analyses the Varbank pipeline (http://varbank.ccg.uni koeln.de), and the CLC Biomedical Genomics Workbench were used. For the downstream analyses only those variants were taken into account that were predicted to be deleterious, rare in publically available databases (mi nor allele frequency <0.1%), experimentally confirmed, and co segregating within the respective family. On average, we have identified 30 50 mutati ons per family that fulfil these criteria. Indonesian samples are underrepre sented in the publically available databases. Therefore the most promising variants are genotyped in 1,000 controls from Indonesia to exclude popula tion stratification. All variants with a MAF >0.1% are excluded. Not all genes implicated in our study will be relevant for SCZ. In search for additional ge netic evidence for the implicated genes, we check publically available SCZ exomes (>2,500 index patients and >1,000 parent proband trios) and addi tional 150 in house exomes of severly affected SCZ patients for the presence of mutations in the identified genes.

Family studies found moderate heritability of MPAs/CFs, but no genetic markers have been consistently identified. This study aims to 1) examine the relationships between MPAs/CFs and clinical cha racteristics; and 2) identify MPAs/CFs related genetic markers in schizo phrenia. Methods A genome wide association study was performed in 1,123 SZ patients to search for genetic variants of MPAs/CFs. Using a 6 item questionnaire to collect MPAs/CFs measurements and calculate a MPAs score. Genotyping was conducted using the PsychChip microarray co developed by PGC and il lumina. Polygenic risk score analysis was applied to predict individual MPAs score. ResultsA total of 1,067 SZ patients and 330,000 SNPs entered final analysis. Patients with more hair whorls (p<0.03) or nostrils anteverted (p<0.01) showed hig her positive symptoms scores. Micrognathia was associated with both po sitive (p<.0003) and negative (p<.0003) symptoms. A polygenic score was significantly associated with patients with higher MPAs score (p<.0001). No single nucleotide polymorphism reached genome wide significance. ConclusionsOur finding suggests that multiple variants with small effects influence MPAs/CFs in SZ. Further investigation into the pathways or biological func tions of these variants would help us understand more about MPAs and its relationship to SZ.

Results: A total of 12 different point mutations were identified. Half of the mutations were newly identified in 9 patients and involve 4 (67%) missense and 2 (33%) frameshift mutations. Moreover we detected 6 different known pathogenic SCN1A mutations in 10 patients, in which 3 (30.0%) of them were missense mutation, 2 (20.0%) of them were nonsense mutation, also 2 (20.0%) of them were splice region variant, and one (10.0%) of them was a frameshift causing deletion.

Candidate ge nes were then screened in 201 unrelated probands with a familial SVD of ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 209Back to index unknown etiology. Results: A heterozygous variant within HTRA1 (Arg166Leu), absent from public databases and predicted to be deleterious by in silico tools was iden tified in all affected members of the index family. Ten probands out of the 201 unrelated familial SVD probands (4.97 %) harbored a heterozygous HTRA1 mutation predicted to be damaging. There was a highly significant difference in the number of likely deleterious variants in cases compared to controls (p,4.2x10 6; OR,15.4; CI,4.9 45.5), strongly suggesting causality. In vitro activity analysis of HTRA1 mutants demonstrated a loss of function effect. Clinical and MRI features of this autosomal dominant SVD differed from those of CARASIL (a very rare, autosomal recessive SVD form, caused by biallelic HTRA1 mutations) by a later age of onset and the absence of extraneurological features.

Compound heterozygosity of both affected siblings and heterozygosity of only c.250C>T in the mother was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The described family supports the conclusion by Tanaka et al. that muta tions in SPATA5 might affect brain development and function, resulting in microcephaly, developmental delay, and intellectual disability.

25717,"Introduction: Working memory is essential for the development of many language related traits. It has been suggested that the rare trait of back ward speaking is linked to working memory. This trait is described as an ability to spontaneously and accurately reverse words. Here we describe individuals (the father and daughter) from a Serbian family who have the ability to speak backward voluntarily. Materials and Methods: We employed behavioral tests to describe the trait and neuroimaging (EEG and fMRI) to study the neural processing behind backward speech. Moreover, we investigated coding sequence changes through exome sequencing and copy number variations using SNP array data in this family. Results: Behavioral data suggests that backward speech loads heavily upon working memory. Event related potentials above the frontal lobe are affec ted by word reversal and the maintenance of backward words in working memory. fMRI revealed that the left fusiform gyrus may facilitate backward speech in the daughter. Exome sequencing identified three novel coding va riants of potential significance in the RIC3, RIPK1 and ZBED5 genes. Conclusions: Our data suggest that in the daughter, backward speech is af forded by an extraordinary working memory capacity. We hypothesize that this is served by cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain to the fron tal cortex and supported by visual semantic loops within the left fusiform gyrus and that these processes may be mediated by a genetic mutation in the RIC3 gene which encodes a chaperone for nicotinic acetylcholine recep tors.

25718," Background: Congenital spinal lipomas are closed spinal dysraphisms be longing to the Neural Tube Defects (NTDs) group. They include a broad spectrum of lesions ranging from simple lipomas of the filum terminale to complex malformations. On histological evaluation, various tissue compon ents of ectodermal, mesodermal or endodermal origin are found within the lipomas, with prevalence for nerves and striated muscle. Overall, rib malfor mations have been occasionally observed in patients with NTDs and in NTD mouse models. However, an ectopic rib arising within the spinal lipoma and articulating with the iliac crest has not been reported in neither of them. Cases: We describe four patients affected by lipomyeloschisis or lipomye lomeningocele, with an unusual fibrocartilaginous protuberance arising within the lipoma and connecting to one iliac crest, resembling an ectopic rib. Histological evaluation confirmed the presence of cartilaginous tissue. Discussion: This anatomical feature is reminiscent of the so called caudal appendages that can arise elsewhere from the midline. In our cases, the pre sence of the extra rib in the sacral region suggests a defect of the genetic pathway that controls the specification of the antero posterior identity. Conclusions: We expand the clinical spectrum of fibrocartilaginous anoma lies associated with spinal lipoma, suggesting the presence of an ectopic rib as a new possible phenotype in NTDs. A careful analysis by neuroradiolo gists and pathologists should be performed in spinal lipomas to assess the presence of an ectopic rib or other uncommon developmental anomalies. Furthemore, molecular studies are required to detect the genetic cause of this unusual phenotype.",2016

There is limited knowledge about the mechanisms whereby these mutations cause the disease. This study aims to characterize the struc ture and function of six previously published pathogenic CHIP mutations. Material and methods: Six mutations E28K, N65S, K145Q, M211I, S236T , and T246M were made by site directed mutagenesis, and purified as recom ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 210Back to index binant proteins from E. coli . The mutants were analyzed and compared with wild type CHIP by ubiquitination activity assay, limited proteolysis assay, oligomerization analysis by gel filtration chromatography, and circular di chroism. Results: Only N65S and T246M showed impaired ability to ubiquitinate the HSC70 chaperone. The limited proteolysis assay showed an increased stabi lity against trypsin digestion for N65S, while T246M and E28K were more rapidly cleaved than wild type, indicating a less compact protein structure. By gel filtration chromatography analysis N65S showed a sharp dimeric peak compared to T246 and E28K that both generated broad oligomeric peaks. K145Q, M211I and S236T behaved overall similar to wild type CHIP . Further characterization is currently being performed using circular dichro ism to analyze protein structure/stability, and in cellular systems to analyze subcellular localization. Conclusion: Our results illustrate that some mutations known to cause re cessive spinocerebellar ataxia 16 can affect protein structure and ability of CHIP to dimerize in vitro. Hence, we speculate that STUB1 mutations might not only affect CHIPÃÂ´s E3 ubiquitin ligase properties and interaction with its chaperones, but may also affect its protein structure and possibly stability in vivo.",2016
25720,"Synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) is a calcium binding synaptic vesicle protein re quired for both exocytosis and endocytosis. We recently described the first human condition associated with a rare variant in SYT1. The individual har bouring this variant presented with an early onset dyskinetic movement disorder, severe motor delay, and profound cognitive impairment. Structu ral MRI was normal, but EEG showed extensive neurophysiological distur bances. Trio analysis of whole exome sequence identified a de novo SYT1 missense variant (I368T). Expression of rat SYT1 containing the equivalent human variant in WT mouse primary hippocampal cultures revealed that the mutant form of SYT1 correctly localizes to nerve terminals and is ex pressed at levels that are approximately equal to levels of endogenous WT protein. The presence of the mutant SYT1 slowed synaptic vesicle fusion kinetics, a finding that agrees with the previously demonstrated role for I368 in calcium dependent membrane penetration. Expression of the I368T variant also altered the kinetics of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Subsequent ly, three further cases of neurodevelopmental disorder associated with de novo mutation in SYT1 have been identified. In common with the first case, structural brain development is normal whilst cortical electrophysiology is severely disturbed, though no case has experienced overt seizures. Motor development is consistently less severely disrupted than communication and social development. Unpredictable deteriorations in behavioural func tion are reported in all cases. Together, the clinical features, electrophysio logical phenotype, and in vitro neuronal phenotype associated with SYT1 mutation highlight presynaptic mechanisms of synchronous neurotransmit ter release and short term plasticity that mediate human motor control and cognitive development.",2016

25722,"Introduction:TREM2 encodes triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 expressed on the cell membrane of many types of immune cells in cluding macrophages, dendritic cells, osteoclasts and microglia. Activation of the TREM2 receptor on microglia stimulates phagocytosis activity and decreases microglial proinflamatory responses. The protein may play role in cleaning damaged or apoptotic cells and cellular debris and help resolve damage induced inflammation. Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, mutations and polymorphic variants may increase the risk of neurodegenerative conditions such as AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of: 250 neurologically normal controls, 150 AD, 192 ALS, 144 FTD patients. TREM2 exon 2 with flankig intronic sequences was mined using Sanger fluorescent method (ABI 3130) in the whole studied group. Results: Six rare variants located in exon 2 of TREM2 were identified, pre dominantly in heterozygous state. Three of them (R62H, R62C, D87N) are present in all groups. Variant D87N in homozygous state was identified in one FTD patient. R98W was found only in one AD patient, T66T and T66M were identified in FTD group only. The results suggest that variant T66M is in linkage disequillibrium with R62C one. Conclusion: Due to modulatory action of TREM2 on inflamatory immune responses in microglia, we suggest that mutations and polymorphisms in TREM2 could contribute to disease pathogenesis in the Polish population.",2016

The complete deletion (CD) mouse model, which carries the same deletion found in WBS patients, recapitulates rele vant features of WBS neurocognitive phenotype and shows a reduction in spine density in CA1 hippocampus. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes are still unknown. Materials and methods: We used some behavioral paradigms related to memory function to study cognitive dysfunction in CD mice.

Finally, the expression of molecules associated with synaptic plasticity was characterized by immunofluorescence techniques. Results: Behavioral characterization of CD mice showed cognitive dysfunc tion, specifically in spatial working memory. In addition, some alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity were present in CA1 hippocampus of CD mice, including a significantly reduced long term potentiation. We also observed molecular dysregulation of some synaptic plasticity markers such as a reduction in BDNF expression in pyramidal layer of CA1 in CD mice.

25724,"Introduction: Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare neurodevelop mental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion at chromosome band 7q11.23. Haploinsufficiency for two General Transcription Factor genes (GTF2I coding for TFII I and GTF2IRD1 coding for BEN GTF3) has been associated with the WBS cognitive profile. A multi copy and variably de leted gene of the family, GTF2IRD2, antagonizes TFII IÃÂ´s activity and may modulate executive function and cognition in WBS. Depending on deletion breakpoints, WBS patients express different GTF2IRD2 copy number and isoforms, including a chimeric form. Methods: We analyzed by immunofluorescence assays the subcellular loca lization of TFII I in neuronal cultures of mice with the complete WBS de letion (CD). The subcellular localization and interaction between different GTF2IRD2 isoforms and TFII I was also studied by immunofluorescence and pull down assays in COS7 cells. Results: We observed a clear reduction of nuclear TFII I in neurons of CD mice, consistent with gene dosage. GTF2IRD2 isoforms were differentially localized in the cells but all interacted with TFII I. Transient expression of patient derived chimeric GTF2IRD2 in neurons of CD mice resulted in an increased amount of nuclear TFII I. Conclusions: Our data show that interactions between GTF2IRD2 isoforms and TFII I could affect the nuclear bioavailability of TFII I and may explain part of the phenotypic variability in WBS. Considering the capital role of TFII I dosage on WBS sociability and cognition, understanding these mecha nisms might provide novel therapeutic targets for these features.

Introduction. Genomic alterations to molecular pathways influence intellec tual functioning. However, psychological consequences of genomic changes remain largely obscure. To get further insights into the emerging field of ge nomic psychology, new tools for correlating genomic and psychological data appear to be required. Here we propose an approach combining psycholo gical evaluation using International Classification of Functioning (ICF CY), chromosomal microarray and original bioinformatic approach for network based classification. Materials and methods. To test the approach, we studied 7 children (1 6 years) with varying degrees of intellectual disability, autism and congenital malformations. From the ICF CY, we focused on general mental functions, communication and involvement. Results. Three cases demonstrated copy number variations and losses of heterozygosity spanning genes involved in metabolic pathways (KEGG: hsa01100): PON1, PON2, PON3, UROC1,UGT1A8, UGT1A10. Bioinformatic analysis showed these genomic and epigenomic variations to underlie phe notypic features. Application of ICF CY showed that all children had little to no phrasal speech (d1331), troubles maintaining cyclic interaction with a person (d3503) and about 50% success in responding to complex requests (more than 3 parameters) (d3102). All children were engaging in symbolic play and shared activities with adults. ÃÂ¡onclusions. The correlation between psychological and genomic data can shed light on molecular pathways to brain malfunctioning. Here, we de monstrated that an opportunity to obtain such correlation combining ge nomic, bioinformatic and psychological methodology does exist. In order to confirm the found typical features and the effectiveness of the approach it should be applied towards a larger cohort. Supported by the Russian Sci ence Foundation (grant:14 15 00411).

25728,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative dis order that eventually leads to the death of motor neurons and fatal paralysis. Approximately, mutations in 26 genes have been associated with pathogene sis of ALS and several of them are also linked with fronto temporal dementia (FTD). However, mutations in these genes explain less than one third of ALS cases. NGS technologies can be used to generate deep sequencing of target genome regions, such as the exome or known disease loci. Generally, the spe cificity and accuracy of the results from panels are more reliable compared to whole exome sequencing data since panels have better and more efficient data coverage than whole exome sequencing. The aim of the current project is to analyze 26 genes that are associated with ALS disease using NGS pa nel. After library and indexed enriched library preparations and validations of samples who had previously tested negative for C9orf72 mutations, the samples were sequenced on Miseq. Analyzing the data showed the sufficient sequencing with mean coverage of more than 150X. Then, bioinformatics analyzes were done and the coding and splicing variants were selected and filtered against MAF below 1% which have been described in HGMD.

25729,"ALS is characterized by the progressive loss of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and muscle mass, followed by muscle weakness, paralysis and death. Most of the studies on ALS focused primarily on motor neurons (MN) to un derstand the etiology of the disease. However, there are evidences sugge sting that muscle dysfunction and NMJ degeneration occur long before sym ptom onset and may contribute to MN death. Recently, HDAC4 was identified as the critical linker connecting neural activity to muscle transcription; in deed induction of HDAC4 leads to increased levels of myogenin. Moreover the regulation of RNA metabolism in the NMJ is an emerging mechanism involved in ALS pathogenesis, and microRNAs (miRNAs) could be the me diators of this process. The aim of this study is to unravel the molecular pa thway that exists between nerve and muscle in order to control the mecha nisms that exacerbate the disease. In particular selected genes and miRNAs involved in the innervation pathway have been analyzed in human skeletal muscle derived from ALS patients. 12 ALS patients with 7 relative controls have been collected for this aim. Selected genes and miRNAs were then ana lyzed through qPCR and differential expression of HDAC4, MYOG, mir 23a, mir 155 and mir 206 was found. Collectively these data suggest that the in nervation pathway is modulated in skeletal muscle in ALS patients and iden tify specific miRNAs potentially acting in HDAC4 inhibition. The inhibition of HDAC4 could represent a promising therapeutic approach to enhance motor performance and slow disease progression in patients with ALS. This study has been funded by Arisl",2016
25730,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult onset motor neuron disease characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lo wer motor neurons. It leads to increasing weakness of voluntary muscles until death occurs from respiratory failure within an average of three years. While important progress has been made in understanding the genetic etio logy of ALS, the majority of genetic variation involved in ALS is still undefi ned. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in an ALS family showing an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomple te penetrance, comprising an index patient and his affected paternal great aunt. By using an overlapping strategy to identify variants shared by the patient and his father, we detected a rare heterozygous frameshift mutation in FIG4 predicted to truncate the FIG4 protein in its active site. FIG4 encodes a phosphoinositide 5 phosphatase with a key role in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Bi allelic FIG4 mutations have previously been described to cause Charcot Marie Tooth disease, type 4J (CMT4J) and Yunis Varon syn drome. Recent studies showed an association between heterozygous FIG4 mutations and ALS. Therefore, we performed WES or targeted sequencing of FIG4 in 200 ALS patients of mainly central European origin revealing five additional known or novel rare heterozygous missense mutations predicted to be deleterious. Disease duration was relatively long in four of six FIG4 mutation carriers, and three of six displayed a predominant upper motor neuron phenotype.

Mutations in a number of genes lead to overlapping phenotypes that cannot always be differentiated clinically or through muscle biopsy. Molecular genetic testing is therefore becoming in creasingly important to the initial diagnosis of potential dystrophinopathies with significant clinical and familial consequences. Materials and Methods: Our cohort comprised more than 80 patients with a suspected differential diagnosis of dystrophinopathy and negative test re sults for DMD gene dosage analysis by MLPA and DMD gene point mutation analysis by next generation sequencing (NGS). As over 700 neurogenetic/neuromuscular genes were captured during the course of technical analysis by NGS, we were able to perform a second tier expanded data analysis of a gene panel including more than 140 genes known to be responsible for congenital muscular dystrophies or myopathies. Results: More than 30% of patients tested were found to have a disease causing mutation in another gene. In other patients sequence variants of unknown clinical significance were detected; the potential clinical relevance of these variants cannot be assessed with certainty without further testing. Conclusion: Multi gene panels utilizing NGS technologies enable sensitive, cost efficient, and simultaneous analysis of multiple disease relevant genes. However, despite the broad analysis, it is not possible to identify pathoge nic mutations in all patients. There is also a risk that the analysis of a large number of genes independent of the clinical phenotype may identify vari ants that can be assessed only in combination with refined clinical or muscle biopsy data and/or segregation analysis.",2016

DMD is inherited in X linked recessive manner caused by mutations in dsy trophin gene (DMD) which is the largest human gene encoding dystrophin protein. DMD gene located at Xp21, contains 79 exons, spanning 2.4 Mb of a genomic sequence. New therapeutic strategies e.g exon skipping made ge netic diagnosis crucial for patients. In Genetic Diagnostic Center of Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, 238 clinically diagnosed male DMD patients were examined by MLPA for detecting deletion or dupli cation in DMD gene. 154 patients (64.7%) had abnormal MLPA results, 140 deletion (58.8%), 14 duplication (5.9%), 84 patients (35.3%) were normal. Most affected exons were exon 50, 46, and 47, respectively. 66.2 percent of MLPA mutations were disrupted readingframe which were candidate of exon skipping. DMD patients were also characterized as follows; mean cur rent age was 8,8 years, mean age at diagnosis was 4.7 years, mean CK levels at diagnosis was 11193 U/L. At diagnosis, 30.5% of patients had asympto matic CK elevation, 69.5% of patients were symptomatic. 11.8 percent of patients had wheelchair dependency. 29.6 percent of patients had family hi story, 57 percent of patients had carrier mother. Statistical analysis revealed that positive family history was significantly associated with normal MLPA results, and wheelchair dependency was significantly associated with pres ence of exonic deletion and duplication.",2016
25737,"Background/Objectives: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne/DMD) is a severe form of muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Molecular testing is essential for an early and accurate diagnosis. Two working groups of international molecular testing experts, organized by BioMarin, met to evaluate the current state of Duchenne/DMD diagnostic molecular testing and results reporting. Methods: Twenty seven Duchenne/DMD experts, including molecular/ clinical geneticists, research scientists, and genetic counselors, met in July and November, 2015 to discuss Duchenne/DMD molecular diagnosis and reporting. Representatives from 20 diagnostic laboratories also completed a comprehensive survey. Results: Laboratories detect large deletions and duplications (~80% of pathogenic DMD mutations) by one or more methods: multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA, 90% of laboratories surveyed), ar ray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH, 40%), and next generation sequencing (NGS, 50%). Few laboratories still use multiplex PCR (mPCR). All these methods, except mPCR, are sufficient to detect deletions/dupli cations in DMD; sequence level mutation detection requires use of Sanger sequencing or NGS. For molecular therapy eligible Duchenne/DMD, precise molecular analysis, accurate result interpretation, and clear reporting are essential to inform healthcare professionals. Discussion: The experts recommend an updated molecular diagnostic algo rithm with tiered testing options to guide the accurate detection of all DMD mutations and determination of molecular therapy eligibility. MLPA based single exon deletion/duplication results must be confirmed by an alterna tive method. If a deletion/duplication is not detected, sequencing is recom mended. The experts recommend revising best practices for DMD molecular testing, interpretation, and results reporting due to new developments in molecular diagnostics and therapies in development.",2016
25738,"Introduction: Dystroglycanopathies, a group of diseases defined by hypogly cosylation of alpha dystroglycan, are classified into three major subtypes: severe congenital muscular dystrophy (MD) with brain and eye anomalies (type A), congenital MD with mental retardation (type B) and limb girdle MD (type C). Eighteen different genes have been linked to dystroglycano pathies, the majority coding for proteins involved in O mannosylglycan bio synthesis. Recently, defects in the synthesis of dolichol phosphate mannose, initially associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation, was shown to cause dystroglycanopathy. Materials and Methods: Twenty one patients with suspected dystroglyca nopathy Ã¢ÂÂ ranging from severe congenital forms to milder adult onset MD Ã¢ÂÂ were genetically characterized by Sanger sequencing, using a stepwise approach or homozygosity mapping. MLPA and/or cDNA analysis was per formed in four cases. Results: Eleven distinct pathogenic variants were identified in four genes: FKRP (5 missense and one base pair duplication, 16 patients), POMGNT1 (2 variants affecting splicing and 1 missense, 3 patients), POMT2 (1 mis sense variant, 1 patient) and FKTN (1 multi exonic duplication, 1 patient). These comprise four unpublished variants: two missense (p. Tyr407Asp and p. Asp360His both in FKRP), one frameshift (FKRP:c.1234dupC) and one ap parently silent substitution causing exon skipping (POMGNT1 :c.534G>A/ r.421_534del).Conclusions: The expanding clinical and genetic heterogeneity of dystrogly canopathies could justify the application of comprehensive next generation sequencing (NGS) applications such as whole exome sequencing. Interestin gly, we found four patients with pathogenic alleles that could be problematic for NGS automated analysis pipeline. Thus, it is essential to employ robust analytical algorithms for data analysis and approaches focusing on RNA to successfully characterize these patients.

We try to modeling epistasis between 5 genes: dystro phin, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, eNOS in case of the wheelchair dependency up to 9or12 years. A retrospective long term study was carried out in 148 corticosteroids free DMD patients. Gene gene interactions were analyzed using entropy based MDR 3.02.The analysis of the hierarchical structure of all components, the best mo del in case of 9wch consists of four interconnected clusters.

25740,"Intergenerational CAG repeat instability is a distinctive feature of HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs disease (HD), associated with genetic anticipation. Intergene rational repeat changes are present in patients and mouse models of the disorder. In this work two large breeding datasets of HD knock in mouse models, globally encompassing more than 18,000 repeat transmissions, led us to confirm and gain new insight into factors influencing intergenerational instability. The first dataset includes information from 16,000 transmissions across five lines (Htt Q80, HttQ92, HttQ111, HttQ140, HttQ175) and allowed us to determine effects of 1) parent of origin; 2) sex of offspring and 3) parental CAG repeat length on the frequency and magnitude of unstable transmissions. Parent of origin, but not the sex of the offspring contributed to intergenerational instability. We also determined that paternal CAG size affects the frequency of expansions and stable transmissions, while not significantly altering the rate of contractions, even though the magnitude of both contractions and expansions are affected by CAG length. Importantly, the sizeable dataset re vealed the presence of large repeat length changes as seen in patients and not previously appreciated in mouse models. The second dataset is comprised of about 2,000 transmissions from knock in mice belonging to six different background strains (129, CD1, FVB, DBA, B6N, B6J), providing insight into effects of genetic background on the fre quency of unstable transmissions independent from parental CAG size ef fects. These results provide novel opportunities to search for CAG instability modifiers through the comparison of genetic variation between different strains.

25741,"We describe a new congenital myopathy due to a homozygous loss of func tion mutation in the kyphoscoliosis peptidase gene (KY). We investigated a 7.5 year old girl with walking difficulties from two years of age presented with generalized muscle weakness; mild contractures in the shoulders, hips, and feet; cavus feet; and lordosis but no scoliosis. She had previously been operated with Achilles tendon elongation. Whole body MRI showed atrophy and fatty infiltration in the calf muscles. Biopsy of the vastus lateralis mu scle showed variability in fiber size, with some internalized nuclei and nu merous very small fibers with variable expression of developmental myosin heavy chain isoforms. Some small fibers showed abnormal sarcomeres with thickened Z discs and abortive nemaline rods. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous one base deletion (c.1071delG, p. T358fs*3) in KY, predicted to result in a truncated protein. Analysis of an RNA panel revealed that KY is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle in humans. A recessi ve mutation in the murine ortholog Ky was previously described in a spon taneously generated mouse mutant with kyphoscoliosis, which developed postnatally and was caused by dystrophy of postural muscles. We describe the first human case of disease associated with KY inactivation. As in the mouse model, the affected child showed myopathy and muscle weaknessÃ¢ÂÂbut in contrast, no kyphoscoliosis.",2016
25742,"The anoctamin 5 belongs to a family of proteins involved in a variety of cel lular functions including chloride ion transport. The precise function of the anoctamin 5 protein remains largely unknown, however expression pattern suggests its important role in the musculoskeletal system. Recessive ANO5 gene mutations cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) and Miyoshi myopathy (MMD3). Here, we describe ANO5 mutations found in LGMD pa tients in Poland. The study group comprised probands representing 82 families with a cli nical diagnosis of LGMD. To find causative mutations and comprehensively analyse genetic background of the disease we have determined exomic se quence using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) method. We have identified eight different ANO5 mutations, two of them novel, in se ven patients. Two patients presented compound heterozygosity and carried mutations that could be considered pathogenic. In three cases known single known ANO5 mutations accompany pathogenic variants in DYSF and CAV3, and might only have phenotype modifying effect. In one case another single, although novel and putatively pathogenic ANO5 mutation, was identified and further investigation of genetic etiology is needed. Our study reveals that ANO5 mutations in the Polish population have lower prevalence compared to the Northern Europe, where it is the second most common cause of LGMD. Additional mutations found apart from the most li kely causative ones might also influence the phenotype. WES can be applied as a single genetic test to quickly characterize the comprehensive spectrum of genetic variation.

DNA se quence analysis of the candidate gene DES revealed a homozygous splice site mutation c.1289 2A>G in the affected family members. IF staining and WB analysis showed that the expression and the cytoskeletal network for mation of mutant desmin were preserved in skeletal muscle fibres. Intere stingly, the affected individuals do not have the classical features of desmi nopathy, neither cardiomyopathy nor the typical histological changes such as disruption of myofibrillar organization, aggregation of intracellular pro teins, dislocation/aggregation of membranous organelles. This novel muta tion results in addition of 16 amino acids within the tail domain of desmin, which has been suggested to interact with lamin B protein. We also detected a specific disruption of desmin lamin B interaction in the skeletal muscle of the patient by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Conclusions: DES mutations should be considered as a cause of LGMD2 wit hout features of myofibrillar myopathy and the inability of mutant desmin to interact with lamin B may trigger disease development.

25744,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism caused by dysfunction of the multi enzyme branched chain alpha ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. BCKDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain alpha ketoacids produced by transamination of the BCAAs leucine, isoleu cine, valine. Classic MSUD is the most common phenotype, represented in about 75% of patients, typically manifested as severe neurological impair ment during the neonatal period. Affected infants typically show lethargy, weight loss, metabolic derangements and progressive neurologic signs, like alternating hypotonia and hypertonia. MSUD can be caused by mutations in at least 3 genes: BCKDHA on chromosome 19q13, BCKDHB on chromoso me 6q14, and DBT on chromosome 1p21. Mutations in BCKDHA gene were associated with approximately 37% of MSUD cases previously described in the literature. Direct sequencing of the BCKDHA gene was performed in or der to screen for germline mutations a dizygotic twin pair with MSUD. The parents are first cousins of Iranian origin. The genetic testing showed one already reported c.452C>T , p. Thr151Met homozygous mutation in only one of the twins. Surprisingly, the second one was negative for this mutation. Both parents were heterozygous carriers. The second child is also MSUD affected as reported by the clinicians. There is a need for further review of clinical data and genetic analysis of the rest two genes to clarify the genetic cause for MSUD in the second twin.

25745,"Introduction: Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are clinically and geneti cally highly heterogeneous with more than 300 associated genes known to date making conventional molecular diagnosis challenging and expensive. Hence, we designed a targeted gene panel consisting of 37 (version 1) and 65 (version 2) genes associated with the most common types of muscular dystrophies and myopathies. Methods: A total of 300 patients was analysed using the software Gen searchNGS (PhenoSystems) after target enrichment of the selected muscle genes and next generation sequencing on a MiSeq desktop sequencer (Illu mina). About 99% of all coding exons were covered >20x, the overall ave rage coverage was >500x. Results: After removing recurrent sequencing artefacts and common va riants (MAF>2%), we detected more than 4000 variants (~1400 different ones) in the 300 patients analyzed, which we classified from benign to pa thogenic (class 1 5). Among these were 35% missense, 29% intronic (9 20 bp flanking sequence), 24% synonymous, 7% potential/essential splice, 4% small deletions/insertions and less than 1% nonsense variants. About 70% of the detected variants were classified as benign (~2200) or likely benign (~720), approx. 20% as uncertain (~820) and 3 4% as likely pathogenic or pathogenic each (~150 each). Conclusions: At least one likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant was iden tified in 180 of the 300 patients suffering from different myopathies (de tection rate: 60%).

Mutations in the MYH2 gene (Myosin heavy chain IIa) have been associated both with an autosomal dominant and a recessive form of proximal myopathy with ophthalmoplegia (MYPOP).We describe two sisters, aged 5 1/2 and 3 years, who presented at birth with partial external ophthalmoplegia and inability to swallow, requiring gastro stomy feeding. The older sister walked by 2 years of age and often complains about leg pain. She had a normal brain MRI and an EMG showed evidence of a bulbar palsy. The younger sister walked before she was 1 year of age. They both show mild proximal weakness. They can walk independently up to 5 minutes and then need to be carried. They fall frequently and have difficulty climbing stairs. Both sisters share the same compound heterozygous novel mutations in the MYH2 gene (p. S294L and p. Q291H), which were identified through exome sequencing via the Complementary Analysis Project on con genital myopathies within the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) project. Bulbar involvement has been described in autosomal dominant MYH2 myo pathies in a patient presenting in his teens with proximal weakness who consecutively developed ophthalmoplegia and swallowing difficulties, and in a baby presenting with generalised hypotonia and swallowing difficulties at birth. Here we describe the first case of an MYH2 related myopathy due to compound heterozygous missense mutations, presenting at birth with bul bar palsy as the predominant feature rather than weakness.",2016
25747,"Myotonia congenita (MC) is characterized by impaired muscle relaxation after contraction presenting as mild to severe muscle stiffness when in itiating movement. Cramping and transitory weakness may occur in some patients. Stiffness is relieved by repetitive contractions of the muscle, the Ã¢ÂÂwarm upÃ¢ÂÂ phenomenon. Mutations in CLCN1, encoding the muscle specific chloride channel, ClC1, disrupt channel forming homodimers by a variety of mechanisms resulting in MC. Over 200 variants are recorded in HGMD. The recessive form (Becker disease, OMIM 255700) is usually associated with more severe symptoms than the dominant form (Thomsen disease, OMIM 160800). However, numerous examples are known of CLCN1 variants that segregate as dominant in some families yet as recessive in others. Wide phe notypic variation occurs even among individuals with the same mutation suggesting reduced penetrance and genetic modifier effects are common. Reported here is the compilation of over 10 years of CLCN1 sequence ana lysis on nearly 500 probands and follow up studies of North American MC families. Thirty five previously unreported variants were identified. During segregation analysis of some MC families we found carriers of variants pre viously classified as recessive had mild myotonia suggesting semi dominant and reduced penetrance inheritance. Discussed here are two specific ex amples, one from a family segregating a presumed loss of function splice variant and the second from a missense variant. Both have long been classi fied as recessive. These studies suggest that haplotype insufficiency may so metimes occur in heterozygotes carrying loss of function variants and some heretofore recessive missense variants have mild dominant negative effects.",2016

Here we report the results from mutation screening of two presumable endemic regions for CLCN1 mutations in Bulgaria. Previous studies of our group discovered a large family from Bulgarian origin populating a village located in the northwest part of the country. The pedigree showed a number of Myotonia congenita type Becker affected individuals both in vertical and horizontal direction, all of them caring a homozygous missense substituti on p. Tyr524Cys. Endogamous marriages are very unusual for the Bulgarian population, supposing a high carrier frequency in this subpopulation.

All striated muscle groups may be involved. MC is due to ClÃ¢ÂÂ channel mutations that reduce the stabilizing ClÃ¢ÂÂ conductance and is caused by mutations in the CLCN1 gene. CLCN1 is located on chromosome 7q35 and encompasses 35 kb in genomic DNA with 23 exons. The disease can be inherited either as an autosomal dominant (ThomsenÃ¢ÂÂs myotonia, MIM 160800) or an autosomal recessive (BeckerÃ¢ÂÂs myotonia, recessive generalized myotonia, RGM, MIM 255700) trait.

NEB consists of 249kb of genomic se quence including 183 exons. Using the NM CGH array, 315 samples from 230 families have been analysed to date, and a pathogenic CNV has been identified altogether in 14% of the studied NM families. These include 15 different large disease causing aberrations in NEB in 31 different families. 12 aberrations were identified in only one family each, one aberration in two families, one in three families and one recurrent aberration in 36 fami lies. The size of the aberrations vary greatly, covering from only a part of one NEB exon (72 bp) to more than half of the gene (133 kb). The recurrent CNV consisting of the 32kb NEB triplicate region (TRI), where eight exons are normally repeated three times, was shown to contain a CNV in 16% of the NM families and in 6% of the families the NEB TRI CNV was interpreted to be pathogenic.

Here, we report a new form of autosomal recessive complex HSP associated with mutation in the ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1 (EPT1) gene, responsible for the fi nal step in Kennedy pathway forming phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from CDP ethanolamine. PE is a glycerophospholipid that, together with phos phatidylcholine (PC), constitutes more than half of the total phospholipids in eukaryotic cell membranes. We determined that the mutation defined dramatically reduces the enzymatic activity of EPT1, thereby hindering the final step in PE synthesis. Additionally, due to CNS inaccessibility we un dertook quantification of PE levels and species in patient and control blood samples as an indication of liver PE biosynthesis. Although this revealed alteration to levels of specific PE fatty acyl species in patients, overall PE le vels were broadly unaffected indicating that in blood EPT1 inactivity may be compensated for in part via alternate biochemical pathways.

We also identified seve ral synonymous variants and variants in non coding regions. Pathogenicity of novel mutations were assessed based upon (a) absence in 100 normal controls, (b) the mutation causes substitution in conserved amino acid resi dues of the proteins, (c) location in protein regions of structural/functional importance, (d) co segregation of the mutations with the disease phenotype and (e) mtDNA multiple deletions and/or depletion.

Clinically, NLSDM patients present with skeletal muscle myopathy and sometimes with severe dilated cardiomyo pathy, hepatomegaly and insulin resistance. NLSDM is caused by a defect in the PNPLA2 gene, which encodes the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), an enzyme that hydrolyses fatty acids from triacylglycerol. Here we report the clinical and genetic findings of an Italian patient carrying two novel PNPLA2 mutations(c.696+4A>G and c.553_565delGTCCCCCTTCTCG). The patient presented at the age of 39 years with right upper limb abduction weakness progressing slowly over the years with asymmetric involvement of proxi mal muscle in upper and lower limbs. At the age of 53 mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was detected. This is the first report of a NLSDM pati ent with a splice site mutation causing an in frame exon5 PNPLA2 skipping. Molecular analysis revealed that only one type of PNPAL2 transcript, lacking exon 5, was present in patientÃ¢ÂÂs cells. Such aberrant mRNA should cause the production of a ATGL protein able to bind lipid droplets but lacking part of catalytic domain.

We describe a boy with severe childhood onset of LGMD with increasing and especial ly distal weakness of the muscles. Initial investigation on a muscle biopsy showed moderate reduction of dystrophin and dysferlin. However, no DMD gene mutation was identified. Additional investigations provided no strong indication for a dyspherlinopathy or sarcoglycanopathy. Previously, several other genes were tested but no causal gene was identified. Therefore we ap plied our NGS approach that evaluates 39 genes known to be responsible for various Limb Girdle muscular dystrophies and several muscular myopathy related diseases. Materials en Methods: All coding exons and at least 20 bp of flanking intro nic sequences were enriched by using the Agilent SureSelectXT Inherited Di sease Panel, followed by sequencing on a Illumina HiSeq2000. Data analysis was performed using a home made pipeline. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 219Back to index Results: High quality sequence data was obtained. Variant analysis using a low stringency analysis pipeline revealed a homozygous pathogenic frames hift mutation in exon 6 of the SGCG gene. Conclusions: Although investigation of a muscle biopsy did not clearly in dicate the involvement of sarcoglycans, we identified a homozygous patho genic SGCG gene mutation, establishing the diagnosis LGMD2C. Indicating that a broad high quality NGS genepanel can identify the causal mutation, if muscle biopsy investigation is not conclusive.",2016
25756,"Charcot Marie Tooth disease is the most prevalent hereditary peripheral neuropathy (1/2500). The most common form (CMT1A) is caused by du plication on Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22), leading to peripheral progressive demyelination, associated with sensibility and mobility loss of upper and lower limbs. The role of PMP22 is currently not well established. To better understand its role, Amici et al. (2006) created a Pmp22 knock out murine model and observed a reduced expression for some integrins. These integrins (ÃÂ±6ÃÂ²4 & ÃÂ±6ÃÂ²1) are known to be involved in Schwann cells differentiation and myelination. In addition, a CMT1A transgenic rat strain, carrying supplementary copies of the Pmp22 gene, was created by Sereda et al. (1996). Our goal was to study in this last model the effect of Pmp22 gene duplication on integrins expression. At various age (from 1 month to 1 year), we studied, on homozygous, he terozygous and wild type rats sciatic nerves, PMP22 and integrins expres sion by quantitative Real Time PCR, Western Blotting, immunohistology and electron microscopy. Our first results show that some of these integrins are not expressed appropriately. In homozygous and heterozygous rats, we observed mislocation of the PMP22 protein and integrins in the Schwann cells. Interestingly, integrins remain collocated with PMP22 despite its bad location. The gene expression and quantity of protein are also varying in correlation with animalÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype and nerve pathology. These experiments show that the Pmp22 overexpression has a potential role on the Schwann cells differentiation and myelination through interac tions with integrins and may explain clinical symptoms of CMT1A patients.",2016
25757,"Introduction: Multi minicore (MmD) and central core (CCD) diseases are two disorders where RYR1 gene plays a crucial role. Most CCD is associated with mutations in RYR1 whereas MmD is related with pathogenic variants in SEPN1 and RYR1. We report a 5 years old male patient histologically diag nosed with MmD (patient 1), and his 10 years old brother diagnosed with CCD (patient 2).Materials and Methods: TruSight One sequencing panel (Illumina) was carried out and SEPN1 and RYR1 genes were analysed. The variants were generated by alignment against reference genome (UCSC hg19) with BWA aligner and GATK variant caller. Then, three VCF files containing common variants in patients and unique variants were generated using BedTools, and a custom priorization script was used to select candidate genes based on different phenotype genotype association databases (Human Phenotype Ontology, DisGeNet, HGMD).Results: Two variants of clinical interest in heterozygous state were detect ed in RYR1 only in patient 1 (c.6721C>T:p. Arg2241Stop and c.2122G>A:p. Asp708Asn).As symptoms of patients could not be explained by these results, we de cided to search potential causal variants in other candidate genes selected. A variant of potential interest was detected in TTN in heterozygous state in both patients (c.59866_59869delAGTG:p. Ser19956LeufsX28). Another variant in TTN canonical splice site in heterozygous state (c.15983 1G>A) was detected in patient 1.Conclusions: These variants in TTN gene do not clearly explain the pheno type of patient 2, but could justify the clinical features of patient 1. We keep analysing variants in other potentially related genes by exome sequencing using the approach described, as scripts are easily scalable.",2016

BACKGROUND: Mutations in the SGCA gene cause limb girdle muscular dys trophy type 2D (LGMD2D), a recessive form of muscular dystrophy mainly affecting proximal muscles. Most individuals present onset in childhood with a progressive and severe clinical course while others have first sym ptoms at young/adult age and a mild form of the disease. METHODS: We report a LGMD2D family with three affected siblings. The in dex case developed muscle weakness involving paraspinal muscles, showing a dystrophic pattern in the muscle biopsy, considered as an axial myopathy. Her two siblings only had hyperckemia. . Exome sequencing was performed as part of Myo Seq project. Sanger sequencing verified the presence of the variants detected. mRNA isolated from muscle biopsy was analysed and the level of different transcripts quantified. RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed an intronic deletion located at c.585 31_585 24 of SGCA in homozygous state. mRNA showed the presence of three different transcripts: 1) The wild type, 2) A transcript with a frames hift deletion of exon 6, and 3) A transcript with a cryptic splicing acceptor leading to a cDNA including 26 extra amino acids coming from intron 6. We confirmed a deficiency of alpha sarcoglycan in the muscle biopsy using IF and WB. The remaining sarcoglycan complex proteins and dystrophin were all normal. DISCUSSION: The mild clinical presentation of LGMD2D in this family is at tributable to the presence of wild type transcript in spite of having a homo zygous mutation. The proportion of each transcript can be the key of the different degrees of severity between family members.",2016
25759,"Introduction: Neurodegenerative genetic diseases of motor neuron charac terized by progressive age dependent defeat of corticospinal motor tract function celebrated as Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSPs). Main features are axonal degeneration and progressive lower limb spasticity. One of them, Spastic Paraplegia 64 (SPG64; OMIM# 615683) is an autosomal recessive paradigm, established by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutati ons in the ENTPD1 gene. Materials and Methods: A seven years old male with chief compliments of severe neurodevelopmental delay referred to SCRC in order to genetic te sting. PatientÃ¢ÂÂs Blood collected from antecubital veins, genomic DNA extrac ted and applied to exome capture, library generation and exome sequencing. Then inheritance validation of candidate variants confirmed by the Sanger sequencing in all family members. Results: A homozygous single base pair deletion in exon 8 of the ENTPD1 gene (chr10:9762261delA) that drives a frameshifting and termination of the protein two amino acids downstream to codon 383 (p. Asn383ThrfsTer2; ENST00000371207) was detected. No other variant that warrants to be re ported was detected. This frameshift variation is not reported in both 1000 genomes and ExAC databases. Conclusion: This mutation led to NMD, frameshifting and production of truncated protein. This mutation truncate the ENTPD1 protein in its extra cellular domain partially and its helical and cytoplasmic domains entirely. We concluded that this truncated protein is the most logical causative for explanation of the SPG 64 phenotype in reported patient and this mutation would be applied in PND and PGD in the family.

Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous mutations of SMN1 gene. Respective of manifestation and achieved motor milestones SMA is subdivided into four clinical types. The number of SMN2 gene copies determines SMA severity. Involvement of some modifiers in SMA progression including DNA methyla tion is also suspected. Our recent genome wide methylation study revealed 40 genes with differentially methylated CpG sites in SMA patients compa red to healthy subjects. DYNC1H1, SLC23A2 and CDK2AP1 genes picked up in our previous study and most probably participating in SMA progression were chosen for the present work. Material and Methods: Analysis of melting profiles was carried out in 78 DNA samples from SMA patients with severe type I (40) and mild types III IV (38) of disease. High resolution melting procedure with bisulphite treated DNA was used. Methylation level was estimated by interpolating polynomi als using values of DNA standards with known percentage of methylation. Results: No differences in methylation of 5Ã¢ÂÂ UTR of SLC23A2 and CDK2AP1 as well as exon 41 of DYNC1H1 were found in the patients with severe and mild SMA. Significantly higher methylation of DYNC1H1 exon 37 was regi stered in mildly affected SMA patients compared to SMA type I patients. Conclusion: Exon 37 of DYNC1H1 lies within CpG rich region and apparent ly should be methylated for preventing spurious transcription initiations. Mutations in DYNC1H1 were shown to be associated with common neuro muscular diseases, such as ALS and dominant SMA. Feasible involvement of DYNC1H1 into SMA pathogenesis is suggested.",2016
25761,"Introduction:Perineuronal net (PNN) is composed of a specialized extracel lular matrix which is found around neuronal cell body and dendrites in the central nervous system. PNN is responsible from synaptic stabilization in neurons and regulation of plasticity. It also has neuroprotective role against excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. One of the major elements of PNN are hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein (HAPLN1), tenascin R (TNR) and aggrecan (ACAN) proteins. Materials/Methods:In order to investigate the effects of HAPLN1, TNR and ACAN during neural differentiation; PC12 cell line which is derived from the neural crest lineage and undergo to a neural phenotype when treated with NGF was used as a differentiation model. mRNA, protein expression levels and distribution of PNN were analyzed before and after differentiation (day 3,5,7). Also neurite length analysis were performed. Results:Our study demonstrated that HAPLN1 and ACAN expression sho wed an increase at day 7 and the longest neurite were detected at that time point (p< 0,05). On the other hand TNR RNA/protein levels remained un changed. In addition to our results obtained from PC12 model of neuronal differentiation, we used spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as a disease model which is caused by neuritogenesis defects. Using transcriptome analysis, we identified that extracellular matrix synapse organization pathways were affected and PNN components showed a significant decrease in SMA fibro blasts. The results were validated and 2 to 5 fold decrease was detected. Conclusions:In vitro disease models and mouse models will also provide information on PNN dysfunction in the pathogenesis of other neurodegene rative diseases. TÃÂBÃÂ°TAK:114S914",2016
25762,"Background and aims: Spinal muscular atrophy Jokela type (SMAJ, OMIM #615048) is a relatively benign form of motor neuron disease. The disease is caused by a dominant mutation c.197G>T p. G66V in CHCHD10 that is a foun der mutation in Finland. Other mutations in CHCHD10 have been reported to cause frontotemporal dementia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD ALS) with mitochondrial myopathy and isolated mitochondrial myopathy. Some mutations have been associated with FTD ALS but their pathogenicity has remained uncertain. We wanted to know if the mutation c.197G>T p. G66V might cause other phenotypes besides SMAJ. Other aims of the study were to find out if there are other mutations of CHCHD10 in Finnish patients and if CHCHD10 mutations are frequent among patients with distinct neurogenic disorders. Methods: Exon 2 of CHCHD10 that harbors all reported mutations was se quenced in 308 patients. In 103 patients the whole coding region of the gene was sequenced. Of the patients included in the study, 208 patients had a phenotype compatible with SMAJ, 22 patients had a non specific neuroge nic disorder, 14 patients had mitochondrial myopathy, and 64 patients had diagnosis of ALS. Results: The founder mutation was found in 20 patients. All of them were suspected to have SMAJ. No other possibly pathogenic mutations were found, and no mutations were found in other patient groups. Discussion and conclusions: Our results suggest that the CHCHD10 muta tion c.197G>T p. G66V is a common mutation in Finland with a prevalence around 2/100000. The clinical outcome of c.197G>T p. G66V is very restric ted to the SMAJ phenotype.",2016

25764,"Tandem repeats polymorphisms (TRPs) are extremely common throughout the genome and represent good candidates for missing hereditability in dif ferent neurodegenerative diseases for whom the expansion of TRP repre sents the major disease gene. To date, TRPs analysis is a remarkable challenge using current next gene ration sequencing (NGS) approach and thus they were never systematically analyzed at genome wide level. The aim of this study is to implement a pipeline for the TRPs analysis from genome wide NGS data. To this purpose, we successfully implemented a new procedure to genotype TRPs, which we applied to a NGS target rese quencing panel containing over 10000 TRP loci, including 37 known disea se causing TRPs. Fifteen DNA patients affected by nine different neurodegenerative diseases and carrying expanded alleles of different lengths/repeat motif have been sequenced and analyzed together with one CEPH sample with about 9900 known TRPs genotyping. Our approach correctly determines the allele size of 76% of known geno types at 63 TR loci in the CEPH sample. Similarly, when considering the ty ping in known disease related loci we obtained a consistent genotyping in almost all cases (98% of 56 genotypes). Even for very large expansions such those in c9orf72 and DM, which are indeed not measurable, we identified those samples carrying a pathological expanded allele. Accordingly, our NGS approach can be applied to discover new disease loci characterized by tan dem repeat expansion.

It is a next generation sequencing (NGS) assay targeted to all exons of all known and predicted myopathy or muscular dys trophy causing genes. The acquired sequencing data was filtered so that only the variants meeting our quality requirements, having a population frequency less than 1 %, and coverage of at least 20X remained. 40 patients were included in this evalua tion study. The patients presented with the clinical phenotype of muscular dystrophy or myopathy but the genetic background of their disorder had not been resolved despite of thorough investigations. With MYOcap, we were able to reach a definitive diagnosis in 12,5 % of the cases, usually meaning known mutations in genes compatible with the phe notype. 7,5 % of the cases were suspected to have either a new phenotype linked to a known disease causing gene or a completely new phenotype genotype correlation. In 20 % of the cases we could clearly state that no variations compatible with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype were found. In 60 % of the cases further studies were recommended.

Spa nish patients with UBQLN2 mutations have not been reported so far. Patients and methods: We studied a large family from Southern Spain in which at least 9 members had a progressive disorder combining upper and, subsequently lower motor neuron manifestations. Clinical data were obtained from 11 individuals in 3 generations. The C9orf72 mutation was analyzed by RP PCR. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was carried out on the proband. Variants in genes causing HSP , ALS and FTD were prioritized. Results: The C9orf72 expansion was not detected. We identified a previous ly reported pathogenic variant in UBQLN2 (NM_013444.3:c.1516C>T; NP_011630.15:p. P506S) segregating with the disease. There was variability in onset age (generally younger in males), initial symptoms (variable combi nation of upper and lower motor neuron), severity and progression rate (generally more severe in men, although one affected woman died at 42). Symptoms of FTD were frequent as disease advanced.

Although the detailed mechanism is not known, UPRmt mechanism activates transcription of nuclear encoded mitochondrial chaperones and quality control proteases to promote prote in homeostasis within the organelle. Mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the main causes of muscle degeneration, has been recognized as a key patho logical hallmark of several major neuromuscular disorders. However, the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and UPRmt has not been investigated yet. For this purpose, an in vitro model of UPRmt was genera ted as a continuously available infrastructure for high throughput analysis.

25770,"Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by deletions/mutations in the SMN1 gene. Classical SMA carriers (1/0) with one of their SMN1 copies mutated show a frequency around 1/40 in our population. SMA carriers with two copies of the SMN1 gene in cis have been described. These 2/0 SMA carriers are undistinguishable from non carrier individuals (1/1) by quantitative stu dies. In the Ashkenazi population, two polymorphisms have been associated with two SMN1 copies in the same chromosome: g.27134G>T in intron 7 and g.27706_27707delAT in exon 8. Furthermore, these alleles are more frequent in Africans in which the presence of chromosomes with two SMN1 copies is higher. Material: We analyzed these markers in 368 Spanish in dividuals including SMA patients with SMN2 SMN1 hybrid genes, 1/0 car riers, controls and individuals with more than one SMN1 copy in cis. Me thods: Sanger sequencing from the exon 7 to 8 of the SMN1 gene. Results: Both SNPÃ¢ÂÂs are more frequently detected in chromosomes with two SMN1 copies in cis in comparison with chromosomes carrying one copy. The g.27706_27707delAT was more frequent in SMN2 SMN1 hybrids than in wild type SMN1 genes (16.7 versus 1.3%, p<0.05). Conclusion: The impact of these polymorphisms depends on the population studied. In our Spanish population, they are less valuable to predict putative 2/0 carriers and their absence does not exclude the existence of two SMN1 in cis. The high fre quency of g.27706_27707delAT in hybrids genes suggest that chromosomal rearrangements are prone to occur in presence of this polymorphism.

We describe a girl dia gnosed at the age of 2 years 10 months with psychomotor and speech delay, clinodactyly of the 5 th finger, big hands and feet and very light iris. At the age of 5 karyotype was performed due to clinical features: linear and whirled hypochromic skin lesions, abnormal iris pigmentation and hair texture. At the age of 6 years patient presented mild intellectual disability and subtle dysmorphic features. Materials and Methods: aCGH analysis was performed using CytoSure ISCA, OGT and chromosome lymphocytes and fibroblasts analysis by G banding techniques. Results: In the aCGH analysis no abnormality was found. GTG banding of me taphases from skin fibroblasts showed the 13q deletion in 38 % of cells. The karyotype was: mos 46,XX,del(13)(q12.1)[16]/46,XX[26]. In chromosome analysis of 600 blood lymphocytes metaphases only one abnormal cell with deletion 13q was detected.

Recently, deletion of proximal arm of the 13q is also repor ted in the literature. Here we report a family with different derivate chro mosomes over a 4.5 year old female patient referred to our department for suspected chromosome breakage syndromes with partial trisomy 22q12.1 and monosomy 13q12.1 originated from maternal t(13;22)(q12.1;q12.1).Material and Methods: Conventional cytogenetics and FISH analyses were performed in all family members using standart methodology. Chromoso mal breakage (DEB) test was performed in index case. Karyotypes were then reported according to the ISCN 2013.Results: Karyotypes of the mother, the index case (DEB test: result) and the male sibling were determined as follows: 46,XX,t(13;22) (q12~13;q11~12), 46,XX,der(22)t(13;22)(q12~13;q11~12) (DEB test: negative) 46,XY,der(13)t(13;22)(q12~13;q11~12). Conclusion: Index case had the findings of both the partial trisomy of 22q12.1 and the monosomy of 13q12.1 in which severe skeletal malfor mations, hirsutismus and eventration of diaphrapma were due to the latter chromosomal aberration. We suggest a possible role of haploinsufficency of a gene, FGF9, located at 13q11 12 for the causality.",2016
25774,"Chromosomal Microarray (CMA) is a first tier test in the diagnostic work out assessment of multiple congenital abnormalities/intellectual disabili ty (MCA/ID) syndromes, detecting pathogenic copy number variations in 15 20% of patients. CMA has allowed the characterization of an increasing number of syndromes, named after their underlying chromosomal unba lance. Even if microdeletions caused by allelic non homogeneous recombi nation of repeated duplicons in flanking regions generally have a relatively homogeneous size, their clinical phenotype can show variable expressivity, making the prognosis evaluation difficult. It is even more challenging, for clinical geneticists, to evaluate the prognosis of patients carrying Ã¢ÂÂuniqueÃ¢ÂÂ non recurrent deletions: the information available in the literature is often very poor, mostly concerning only partially overlapping microdeletions. 2p14p15 microdeletions can be considered as a typical example of the latter group of chromosomal abnormalities. Only three patients have been repor ted to date, showing ID and dysmorphisms. We report the clinical and mole cular cytogenetic characterization of four further ID/MCA patients from France and Spain carrying 2p14p15 microdeletions. The present study and a review of the literature showed that 3/7 patients had sensorineural hea ring loss. No deafness causing gene has been reported so far in 2p14. Here we discuss the possible role of the ACTR2 and SPRED2 genes in the observed hearing loss. Significant ophthalmological involvement was noted, including glaucoma and rod degeneration. One patient developed a progressive car diomyopathy, suggesting that a cardiac follow up should be systematically warranted, even in the absence of congenital heart disease. In conclusion, our study contributes significantly to delineate the phenoty pic spectrum of 2p14p15 microdeletions. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25775,"Human and Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania. Many patients have genomic alterations that are described in only few indi viduals and evaluation of clinical significance of these chromosomal altera tions is very challenging. Nevertheless detection of novel pathogenic copy number variants and delineation of novel genomic disorders is an important part of genomic studies. We report on three affected individuals in a family, a mother and her two daughters, 9 and 15 years of age, with mild intellectual disability, minor fa cial anomalies, congenital heart defect, short stature, broad chest, and sco liosis. The mother and her older daughter additionally had microcepahly and delayed puberty. Submicroscopic chromosomal alterations were screened by whole genome genotyping analysis using the HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and revealed 4q13.3 microdeletion, 1.5 Mb in size. FISH analysis using RP11 373J21 probe overlapping part of ADAMTS3 gene confirmed the deletion in all three affected individuals. This novel chromo somal alteration involves GC, NPFFR2, ADAMTS3, COX18 and ANKRD17 ge nes. ADAMTS3 gene is highly expressed in specific regions of the developing mouse brain and in connective tissues such as bone and tendon. This clinical report provides clinical and molecular characterization of pre viously unreported 4q13.3 microdeletion. ADAMTS3 gene might be a can didate gene for intellectual disability and other clinical features, including short stature. Detailed clinical examination of additional patients with a similar microdeletion is needed for further delineation of this clinically re cognizable syndrome.

25776,"Distal trisomy 4q and distal monosomy of 10q are rare, complex syndromes of intellectual disability, developmental and behavioral problems and di stinctive facial features. The severity of the condition and the signs and sym ptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and/or deletion and which genes are involved. Although some cases occur sporadically, most are inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation. Individual cases of trisomy 4q31.3 and deletions of 10q24 are rare and have been previously reported in the literature, with variable clinical manifestations. We report the case of a boy with partial trisomy for the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q31.3 >qter) and a concomitant monosomy 10(10q24 >qter). The patient presented with hydrocephaly, craniofacial dysmorphism, cryptorhidism and axial hypotonia. The chromosomal ab normalities resulted from a paternal balanced translocation involving chro mosomes 4 and 10. The inheritance and identity of the translocation was ascertained by extensive familial cytogenetic and FISH studies. To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a translocation that resulted in the combination of monosomy 10q24 and trisomy 4q31.3 coexi sting in the same individual.

25777,"Recently described 5q35 microduplication reciprocal to the common Sotos syndrome deletion (~2 Mb) is associated with microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay and delayed bone maturation. The clinical picture is largely opposite to that of Sotos syndrome (macrocephaly, overgrowth and advanced bone age). The dosage effect of NSD1 (5q35) is suggested to be the cause of the main clinical problems. We report a dysmorphic newborn with IUGR, microcephaly, short stature, and prenatally diagnosed congenital heart defect (ASD, VSD, left ventricle hypoplasia). First routine karyotype analysis (GTG banding) revealed a nor mal male karyotype. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA, HumanCytoS NP 12 BeadChip, Illumina Inc.) revealed a ~8.3 Mb duplication of 5q35.1 qter. To localize the extra copy, FISH analysis was done with Kreatech hTERT/NSD1 and 5p/5q subtelomeric probes. Surprisingly, two additional signals of NSD1 and 5qter were seen, located on a small additional marker chromosome, which was present in ~10% of metaphases (all of them were of bad band quality and so escaped in first analysis), and in 50% of inter phase nuclei. The mosaic tetrasomy due to the presence of der(5q) marker chromosome in ~50% of cells results in a typical duplication picture seen in CMA as well as in clinical features typical for 5q35 duplication. More severe clinical pic ture compared to common 5q35 duplication can be explained by encompas sing NK2 (cardiac development) and MSX2 (limb and bone development) genes.",2016
25778,"IntroductionWilliams Beuren (WBS) and 7q11.23 microduplication (7DUP) syndromes are two neurodevelopmental disorders caused by reciprocal rearrange ments at 7q11.23, either deletions (WBS) or duplications (7DUP). These recurrent rearrangements are generated by non allelic homologous recom bination (NAHR) between flanking segmental duplications (SDs).MethodsBy dosage analyses of site specific nucleotides or cis morphisms, single and multiple copy microsatellites in trios, we have investigated the extension and parental origin of the rearrangements in 720 WBS and 99 7DUP pa tients and evaluated the presence of susceptibility factors in transmitting parents. By haplotype cloning and RT PCR, we have characterized the junc tion fragments at sequence level in a subset. ResultsDeletion events were all de novo, while duplications were mostly de novo (88%) and also inherited (12%). The type and size of the rearrangement was similarly distributed in del/dup cases: 1.55Mb (86%/89%), 1.83Mb (12%/7.5%) and atypical (2%/3.5%). No differences were observed in the parental origin. Disrupted alleles were mediated by inter chromosomal NAHR in 7q11.23 paracentric inversion carriers in 20%/30% (del/dup) of cases. Rearranged chromosomes resulted in different copy number of the NCF1 gene, and the generation of chimeric GTF2IRD2 transcripts in a sub set of probands. We further defined a 1.4Kb hotspot for intrachromosomal NAHR of paternal origin within intron 19 of GTF2I and characterized two additional hotspots for reciprocal inversion mediated events at intron 2 of GTF2IRD2.ConclusionsRearrangements causing WBS and 7DUP are the result of reciprocal NAHR events between SDs at 7q11.23. A few hotspots for positional preference of recombination can be identified within SDs. Grant Support: CONV. NÃÂº52",2016

We report a 12 year old male presenting with developmental delay, atten tion deficit hyperactivity disorder, social personality, short stature, hands tremor, bruxism and facial dysmorphisms that was studied by Agilent 180K oligonucleotide array CGH. Array CGH revealed a 2.8Mb de novo interstitial deletion at chromosome 9p21.1p13.3(33,100,287 35,911,318 bp)[hg19], overlapping the previously described patients. The reported patient presents the smallest 9p13 interstitial deletion as it only includes sub band 9p13.3, besides 100Kb from band 9p21.1, while the previous described patients have larger deletions including band 9p13. The patients share a 2.1Mb commonly deleted region that includes 65 genes, 34 described in OMIM and 11 in Morbid Map. One of those genes is NPR2, with heterozygous mutations associated with short stature without a distinct clinical phenotype, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of the gene contribu tes to short stature, a feature reported in the four patients characterized by array CGH. These patients share a particular association of clinical features such as developmental delay, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, social perso nality, short stature, hands tremor, bruxism and facial dysmorphisms that suggest that 9p13.3 deletion might be a new syndrome.",2016
25780,"Female balanced X autosome translocations are usually associated with ab sence of functional copies of the gene mapping at the breakpoint through disruption of the derivative chromosome copy and inactivation of the normal X chromosome. We report on a nine year old girl with karyotype 46,X,t(X;9)(q23;q12)dn, disproportionate short stature (<1st centile), sep tal atrial defect, scoliosis, bone dysplasia, and normal cognition. Array CGH and breakpoint sequencing confirmed the full complement of genetic ma terial, whereas replication banding showed preferential inactivation of the normal X chromosome. The autosomal breakpoint affects a heterochroma tic region while the X chromosomal breakpoint was mapped between the AMMECR1 and RGAG1 genes. Whereas expression of the latter was unmodi fied, RT qPCR indicated absence of AMMECR1 expression in the blood and lymphoblastoid cells of the patient. The encoded AMMECR1 protein, which is evolutionary conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including bacte ria, archea, yeast and mammals, localizes to the nucleus in HeLa cells, and contains nucleic acid binding RAGNYA domains. We show that AMMECR1 is co expressed with genes implicated in cell cycle and translation regulation; five of which were previously associated with growth and bone alteration syndromes. Our knockdown of the zebrafish orthologous gene resulted in animals with shorter tails, thin and curved bodies, dorsally kinked tail ends, poorly defined somites, pericardial edema and hydrocephaly phenotypes reminiscent of our patientÃ¢ÂÂs features. Our results suggest that AMMECR1 is potentially involved in cell cycle control and linked to a new syndrome with growth, bone and heart alterations.",2016
25781,"Introduction: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by genetic defects leading to loss of expression of the maternal copy of the chromosome 15q11 13 imprinted region. Most cases are sporadic, being caused by de novo deletion of maternal chromosome 15q11 13 or by paternal uniparental disomy. Familial cases can occur, due to mutations in the UBE3A gene or in the imprinting center. Materials and Methods: We describe two sibs with mental retardation, ab sence of speech, and typical facial dysmorphism. The family members were screened by MS MLPA probemix ME028 B2 Prader Willi/Angelman for copy number variations and assessment of methylation profile. Both child ren MS MLPA profiles were compared with their parents and 3 normal con trols. Results: The test for methylation revealed missing SNRPN methylation spe cific fragments in the patients profile in comparison to their parents and normal controls, which is compatible with paternal non methylated frag ments and deleted or wrong methylated maternal fragments. The copy number test did not show deletion of the SNRPN specific fragments, but two other fragments, corresponding to AS SRO region (part of the PWS AS im printing center) were deleted. The deletion was detected in both affected children and it was inherited from the asymptomatic mother. Conclusion: The missing SNRPN methylation specific fragments correspond to wrong methylation (demethylation) on the maternal allele due to deleti on of the PWS AS imprinting center. This mistake in the methylation profile in both affected children affects maternal copy, while in the asymptomatic mother most probably the deletion affects the paternal copy, hence non pathogenic.",2016
25782,"Aquaporin 4, encoded by AQP4, is the predominant water channel in the brain with importance for the blood brain barrier, water and electrolyte ba lance, and edema formation and clearance. In an adult with mild/moderate ID, sensorineural hearing loss, ataxia, tre mor and progressive spasticity, a de novo missense variant was found in AQP4 (NM_001650.4) c.332G>C, p.(Ser111Thr). Pregnancy and birth had been normal, but shortly thereafter he developed heart failure associated with a cardiomyopathy that later resolved. Neonatal EEG and CT indicated brain ischemic injury, but that also resolved. He had delayed motor and speech development but normal social skills and behavior. A recent cerebral MRI showed large ventricles and atrophic changes in the lentiform nucleus. He is short (L 8 cm < 2.5 p) with a large head (HC 60 cm) and mild facial dys morphism. Even though no other similar cases have been found, his clinical picture is judged to be compatible with an aquaporin dysfunction. The S111T change affects a highy conserved phosphorylation site in a short cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domain 2 and 3 of AQP4, found necessary for channel activation but not regulation of of water permeabi lity. Possibly, the change from a serine to a threonine phosphorylation site affects phosphorylation dynamics in a way that disturbes channel fine re gulation upon e.g. local changes in osmolality. This remains to be proven.",2016
25783,"In the 15q11.2 q13 region five recurrent breakpoints (BP1 to BP5) have been observed. The most common rearrangements are the type I (BP1 BP3) and II (BP2 BP3) deletions associated with well known phenotype (Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes). Clinical manifestations of type I and II deletions include speech and motor developmental delay, behavioral and characteristic dysmorphic features, however, BP4 BP5 microdeletions comprising CHRNA7 lead to intellectual disability accompanied by epi lepsy. Furthermore, in a couple of cases with less severe symptoms, BP1 BP2 (15q11.2) deletions have been published.

Infancy and childhood are the most critical for life threatening events, such as acute respiratory symptoms, due mostly to complications of stenosis of the pulmonary arteries. Vascular changes might cause aneurys ms or artery dissections later in life. The causal gene SLC2A10 encodes the facilitative glucose transporter 10 and nearly 100 patients and 23 mutations are known. We report a 10 year old Macedonian girl who was referred due to easy fati gue and visible vascular pulsations on the neck.

She was a slender girl with joint hypermobility, narrow face, high arched palate and crowded teeth. Enlarged, elongated, and extremely tortuous large and medium size blood vessels were detected on ultrasono graphy and magnetic resonance angiography. SLC2A10 molecular analysis revealed homozygous c.254T>C(p. Leu85Pro) mutation in the patient. Her parents were unrelated heterozygous carriers. Interestingly, the same muta tion was previously found in two Macedonian brothers with a severe clinical presentation. Detailed family history evaluation revealed that the present patient is a second cousin of these two brothers, with parents being first cousins.

25785," Introduction: BardetÃ¢ÂÂBiedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive multi systemic human genetic disorder characterized by six major defects including obesity, mental retardation, renal anomalies, polydactyly, retinal degeneration and hypogenitalism. In several cases of BBS, few other fea tures such as metabolic defects, cardiovascular anomalies, speech deficits, hearing loss, hypertension, hepatic defects and high incidence of diabetes mellitus have been reported. The BBS displays extensive genetic hetero geneity. To date, 19 genes have been defined as related to BBS. In this study, we analyzed 18 BBS related genes in a patient by NGS tech nique. Materials and methods: Panel based next generation sequencing as a reliab le technique to detect mutations in 18 BBS associated genes was used. Results: NGS detected one novel mutation c.936delA in coding exon 11 of TTC8 gene that related to BBS type 8. Bioinformatic analysis (CADD score:22.6) confirmed that this mutation is pathogenic in nature. This de letion creates a frame shift that leads to early termination of aminoacid co ding, which is expected to affect the function of protein. Conclusions: We found a novel mutation in TTC8 gene that related to BBS type 8. This finding can be useful in genetic counseling and Prenatal diagno sis during next pregnancy.",2016

Materials and Methods: The disease locus was identified by linkage map ping using SNP genotype data of 14 family members. Whole exome sequen cing for two affected subjects revealed rare/novel variants. Results: At the disease locus, an approximately 4.5 Mb region at 3q29 yielding a multipoint LOD score of 3.69, homozygous nonsense CEP19 c.194_195insA (p.

It en codes a coiled coil domain containing ciliary protein that localizes to the primary cilia as do some other BBS proteins. The protein sequence is totally conserved between human and chimpanzee. The gene is expressed in seve ral organs. It has been associated with obesity with azospermia in a family. Although the low frequency of the CCDC28B variant indicates that the pre sence of the variant is not circumstantial, the variant did not correlate with phenotype severity. Absence of any renal disturbance in the family can be attributed to the absence of expression of the gene in kidney.(Grant: BoÃÂaziÃÂ§i University Research Fund 7695)",2016

25793,"Developments in technology led to increased understanding of the gene tic basis of the Chromatin Disorders, a group of developmental disorders caused by disruption of chromatin remodelling (DDCRs). We used Facial Dysmorphology Analysis technology (FDNAÃÂ®) to objectively evaluate the craniofacial dysmorphic features of DDCRs. We propose that a condition should be recognizable by gestalt if it fulfills the following criteria: (i) the Ã¢ÂÂsyndromic faceÃ¢ÂÂ is significantly different from the average, general popula tion face (denoted as Ã¢ÂÂseverityÃ¢ÂÂ); (ii) the syndromic face is significantly dif ferent from typical faces of other syndromes (denoted as Ã¢ÂÂdistinctivenessÃ¢ÂÂ); (iii) the variability between faces of patients with the same syndromic dia gnosis is minimal. As variability is difficult to assess without knowing the full spectrum of the conditions, we focused our analysis on the severity and distinctiveness of DDCRs by using published, 2D facial photographs of patients with 20 di stinct, molecularly confirmed DDCRs to create a common Ã¢ÂÂfacial photo cropÃ¢ÂÂ for DDCRs. This was proven to be distinct to the Ã¢ÂÂaverage, normal faceÃ¢ÂÂ. To evaluate the severity and distinctiveness of the DDCR faces, we compared each of the 20 syndromesÃ¢ÂÂ facial photo crops (n,5) to 1) other syndromes in the DDCR group (19 syndromes); 2) other dysmorphic syndromes not in the DDCR group (100 other syndromes); 3) normal (1000 photographs). Methods included the mean area under the curve (AUC) to compare bet ween samples and ROC curve plotting the true positive rate as function of false positive rates. We report the results of this analysis and discuss its im plications.",2016
25794,"Background: Most approaches are insensitive to the full mutational spectrum of chromosome rearrangements associated with human developmen tal abnormalities. Therefore, our aim is to introduce next generation se quencing (NGS) into clinical cytogenetics, creating a sequence based Next Gen Cytogenetics to catalyze a dramatic advancement in clinical diagnostics. Methods: Twenty families with chromosome rearrangement associated di seases, including two prenatal (PN) cases, have been enrolled. Fourteen of these were also analyzed by NGS using large insert paired end libraries. Results: The majority of these cases were confirmed to be balanced reci procal rearrangements, whereas 4 were complex chromosomal rearrange ments including 1 of chromothripsis. Thus far, over 50 breakpoints were identified disrupting protein coding genes, lncRNAs, or intergenic regions, thus revealing candidate genes or genomic loci. These cases are further assessed for pathogenicity from positional effects on genes located within topological domains (TADs) containing the breakpoints using DECIPHER predictions of haploinsufficiency. In one PN case, the 16q24 breakpoint dis rupts ANKRD11, etiologic in the autosomal dominant KBG syndrome (OMIM #148050), predicting an abnormal phenotype. The chromothripsis case, submitted as 46,XY,t(7;14)(q22;q32.1),inv(15)(q21.2q26.1), proved by NGS to carry two further deletions, at 3p12 (5.3 Mb) and 15q14 (488 kb), as well as an insertion of 644.4 kb from 15q14 into 3p14. The inv(15) is in fact a complex rearrangement of 15q with eight breakpoints. Conclusions: We demonstrate that NGS based chromosomal rearrangement characterization leads to major improvements in identification of chromo somal aberrations and in prediction of clinical outcomes of postnatally and prenatally detected genomic rearrangements, and to contributions to hu man genome annotation.

25795,"Introduction: CLAPO syndrome (OMIM:613089) is a vascular/overgrowth disorder characterized by Capillary malformation (CM) of the lower lip, Lymphatic malformation (LM) of the face and neck, Asymmetry, and Partial Overgrowth. Six cases have been reported so far. Inheritance pattern is still unknown, but somatic mosaicism is suspected. Methods and Results: We performed a retrospectively review of CLAPO patients diagnosed in our hospital (10 cases) between 2008 and 2015, the largest cohort to date. The hallmark clinical feature is the CM of the lower lip, expressed congenitally in all patients; all other features can be present at birth or develop at a later stage in life. Eight patients showed LMs involving oral mucosa and neck. LM seems to be more frequent in the oral cavity, speci fically in tongue, and it is commonly complicated with severe haemorrhagic events. Five patients showed asymmetric overgrowth at birth, and only one presented generalized overgrowth. As a preliminary molecular approach we performed NGS experiments (100x) in paired blood/tissue samples, using a custom panel covering about 300 vascular/overgrowth related genes, in cluding PIK3CA , PTEN, etc. No germinal/somatic mutations were detected. Conclusion: Here, we present an expansion of the phenotype of CLAPO syn drome, in which we more clearly define some of the originally described clinical manifestations. We have also discarded, at medium reading depths, the presence of somatic mosaic mutations in genes known to cause clinically related syndromes. Our future approach includes increasing reading depth in candidate genes, for better detection of low mosaics, and to perform who le exome NGS.",2016
25796,"Background: A high prevalence of cleft lip with or without palate (CLÃÂ±P) was detected in Patagonia (Argentina) and Amerindian ancestry appointed as a risk factor. In this presumably more homogenous population, we searched for de novo copy number variation (CNV) in CLÃÂ±P subjects. Method: 30 families with isolated CLÃÂ±P (31 affected and 113 total individu als) were genotyped on the Affymetrix Genome Wide SNP 6.0 array. CNVs identification was performed on Genotyping Console and CHAS (Affyme trix). From all identified CNVs from affected subjects, we filtered out those with lesser chances of pathogenicity according to the following criteria, con sidering a minimum of 60% overlap: (1) mean maker distance higher than 5kbp; (2) CNVs also present in healthy relatives; (3) common CNV from DGV and (4) within 1mbp from telomeres and centromeres. Results: We detected 28 de novo CNVs larger than 200kbp, 6 of which over lapped genes previously associated with CLÃÂ±P . Five were deletions (no homogenous loss) and 23 duplications. Five segments were detected in 3 subjects and 7 were detected in 2 subjects, indicating recurring de novo du plications in unrelated individuals. Conclusion: Results corroborates the role of the following genes to the ae tiology of CLÃÂ±P: GLI2, PKP1, MKX, PVRL1, CDH1 and TYMS. 22 genomic segments not previously associated with CLÃÂ±P were also identified, contri buting to a more general framework of the CNV role in CLÃÂ±P , evidencing the complex aetiology of the condition and the need for biological evidence of all CNVs appointed here and in the literature.

25797,"Non syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) is one of the most common congenital malformations and has a multifactorial etiology. To date, a number of common risk variants have been identified for nsCL/P , explaining about 24% of the genetic heritability. It has been suggested that some of the remaining genetic liability might be explained by rare de novo mutations, which is supported by the frequent observation of sporadic nsCL/P cases and a higher nsCL/P recurrence risk in offspring compared to parents. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in 50 sporadic nsCL/P cases of Central European ancestry and their unaffected parents. Exome capture was performed using SureSelect XT Human All Exon V5 and libraries were sequenced using 1x125bp paired end sequencing. Raw data were processed using the default BWA/GATK v.3.4 pipeline including VQSR and the geno type refinement workflow. Annotation of the possible de novo events was done using ANNOVAR. We identified 158 high confidence de novo variants of which 59 were either missense or nonsense variants which did not map to regions of segmental duplications. Validations were performed on all variants with a quality by depth Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 4, ex cluding variants with bad WES reads in the region of interest. So far, we con firmed all 27 residual variants, including their de novo status. Our preliminary results show the presence of de novo mutations in nsCL/P patients. We are currently performing further confirmation and follow up studies investigating the causality of the true de novo variants. These results will be presented at the conference.",2016
25798,"The most frequent subtypes of orofacial clefts are nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P) and nonsyndromic cleft palate only (nsCPO), both considered multifactorial. A common syndromic form of clef ting is Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) where patients have CL/P or CPO, often but not always associated with lower lip pits. Recently, ~5% of VWS patients were identified with mutations in the grainy head like 3 (GRHL3) gene. To investigate GRHL3 in nonsyndromic clefting, we evaluated 672 European patients with apparently nonsyndromic clefts (576 nsCL/P , 96 nsCPO) sequencing the GRHL3 coding region. We identified four novel trun cating GRHL3 mutations in nine patients from four families, two of them de novo. All individuals harboring mutations had exclusively nsCPO. Most inte restingly, in nsCPO patients we identified a higher minor allele frequency for rs41268753 (0.099), compared to controls (0.049; P,1.24ÃÂ10 2). This as sociation was replicated in nsCPO/control cohorts from Latvia, Yemen and the UK (Pcombined 2.63ÃÂ10 5; ORallelic 2.5 (95% CI 1.6 3.7)), and reached genome wide significance in combination with imputed data from a GWAS in nsCPO triads (P,2.73ÃÂ10 9).

The data gathered the last decade allowed to further refine the interpretation of results and helped tÃÂ¾ discriminate pa thogenic from normal variants. Materials and Methods: 81 patients with multiple malformations, intellec tual disability and normal karyotype were included in the study. Peripheral blood sample was collected from every participant after signed written in formed consent. Array CGH analysis was performed on Agilent ISCA 4x44k v2.0 oligo arrays by manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs protocol. Arrays were scanned on Agi lent G2505A scanner. Data was analyzed by Bluefuse Multi software v4.2. Variants were further classified based on size, frequency, type, gene content and function into four groups benign, probably benign, VUS and pathoge nic. Results: 281 CNVs were identified. Average number of CNVs per patient is 3,5. Pathogenic CNVs (n,13) were found in 13,6% (n,11) of our patients. Among pathogenic CNVs deletions were 69,2% (n,9), while duplication re presented 30,8% (n,4). Pathogenic CNVs sized greater than 1mb represent 76,9% (n,10). 30,8% (n,4) of pathogenic variations were considered irre levant to the phenotype. Benign CNVs (n,118) and probably benign CNVs (n,110) were respectively identified in 69,1% (n,56) and in 72,8% (n,59) of the patients in our cohort.

CaseReport: A boy was born in term with a low normal birth size (2500/48/32) and without cataract or arthroghryposis. Postnatally procee ded severe feeding difficulties (PEG), severe growth retardation ( 5,5 SD) and microcephaly ( 6,6 SD). In his age of 3,5 y he could not sit and stand alone and showed no speech. His face was not typical Ã¢ÂÂold lookingÃ¢ÂÂ, but sho wed some dysmorphy and extreme dental caries. The trunk was hypotonic, extremities hypertonic, with mild contractures of elbows and knees. Other findings presented cryptorchism, general brain atrophy (MRI), no photosen sitivity and no retinopathy. DNA: Homozygote mutation in the ERCC6 gene (c.2047C>T , p.

On the other hand, a few patients with other mutations in ERCC6 gene had been referred as severe CS or CS/COFS, because their congenital symptoms (IUGR, microcephaly, cataract, arthrogryposis) and absent neurological development fulfilled also the definition of COFS.

To date, SMARCE1 mutations account for only 2% of the cases, with just two variants reported: c.218A>G (p. Tyr73Ser) in two patients and c.314G>A (p. Arg105Gln) in one patient and his affected mother (the latter of uncertain pathogenicity). Material and methods: A cohort of 18 unrelated patients with features sug gestive of CSS has been screened using a custom next generation sequencing panel (BAF_v1.1 Roche NimbleGen) including the genes of the BAF complex as well as other interacting genes. Results: We present two additional patients in whom the variant p.

25802,"Introduction: Coffin Siris syndrome(CSS) is a rare disorder characterised by intellectual disability, distinctive facies, hypoplastic/aplastic 5 th finger nails and/or toenails and growth retardation. Pathogenic variants in ARI D1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SMARCE1 of the SWI/SNF complex are known to cause CSS. Method: Between January 2013 and July 2015, 17 patients with clinical dia gnosis of CSS underwent whole exome sequencing(WES) in search of the SWI/SNF complex genes. Results: We report 12 individuals (5 males,7 females) with molecular confir mation. All had developmental delay, dysmorphism with coarse facies, thick lower lips, hirsutism and hypoplastic nails. Five patients had microcephaly; 8 had failure to thrive; 9 had short stature; 2 had secundum ASD. Cases with non typical features would also be highlighted. WES identified heterozy gous mutations in ARID1B in 10 probands, and in SMARCB1 in 1 patient. Interestingly, a boy with features more in keeping with CSS had a mutati on in SMARCA2, the gene associated with Nicolaides Baraitser syndrome, highlighting the many similarities of these two syndromes. All were novel mutations. Seven were de novo, one child was adopted, four others have yet to be determined. The ARID1B mutations included 4 frameshift insertions, 3 frameshift deletions, 2 nonsense mutations and 1 splice site mutation. The SMARCB1 and SMARCA2 mutations were missense mutations. The child with SMARCB1 seemed the worst affected with severe growth retardation and cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Mutations in ARID1B are the predominant cause for CSS in Ma laysia. Due to overlapping phenotypes with Nicolaides Baraitser syndrome and chromosomal abnormalities, molecular confirmation directs accurate genetic counselling and expands the phenotypic spectrum.

25804,"The genetics of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is poorly under stood. We hypothesize that Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) application will advance our understanding of genes involved in CDH pathogenesis. We performed WES on 13 patients from 9 different families. Dominant and recessive models were taken into account for variants calling in all cases. We identified pathogenic variants in known CDH causal genes: ZFPM2, KMT2D and PORCN. In addition, we observed probably pathogenic variants in 3 ge nes thus far not yet known to cause CDH, including PIGN in a fetus with complex bilateral CDH. Similarly to the previous reports, ZFPM2 mutations are the most incrimina ted in CDH and are also observed with a reduced penetrance and a variable expressivity in our families. This gene is a GATA4 activity modulator and is subsequently important for diaphragm and heart development. PORCN gene lesions cause of X linked Focal Dermal Hypoplasia that was previous ly considered to be embryonic lethal in male. Interestingly, we are the first to report PORCN variant in non mosaic males. Defective PORCN, leads to an impairment of WNT trafficking through the cell which affects the down stream genes dependent on this pathway. PIGN is involved in Glycosylphos phatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis. Prior to our report, PIGN mutations were described in association with multiple malformations but seldom with CDH which we suggest to result from a more severe loss of function.

25811,"Carrying a parental pericentric inversion can cause deleted/duplicated offsprings. According the literature, del(Xp)/dup(Xq) is a rare chromosomal aberration in males due to maternal pericentric inv(X). A seven days old male patient was referred us because of dysmorphic fea tures. He was born at 35 weeks gestation age by C/S because of oligohydram nios. Physical examination findings were narrow biparietal diameter, broad nasal root and nasal bridge, depressed nasal tip, short columella, long,flat philtrum,thin upper lip and retromicrognathia. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs karyotype was 46,XY. We performed subtelomeric FISH analysis because of non sendromic dysmorphic faetures. Two signals for Xqter were detected on each tip of X chromosome , but no signal was detected for Xpter. His microarray analy sis revealed that there were 3.7Mb deletion on Xp22.33p22.31 which con tains 9 OMIM genes, 2.5Mb deletion on Xp22.33 pseudoautosomal region which contains 23 OMIM genes, 2 Mb duplication on Xq28 which contains 52 OMIM genes and 270Kb duplication on Xq28 pseudoautosomal region which contains 3 OMIM genes. Chromosomal analysis from both parents were performed for possible pericentric inversion of X chromosome and another chromosomal aberrations. Paternal karyotype was normal, but his mother had pericentric inversion of X chromosome which was confirmed by subtelomeric FISH analysis. His brother also had pericentric inversion(X). We present this case in order to contribute to the literature. It is important to provide genetic counseling that pericentric inversion carrier parents have risk of deleted/duplicated offsprings and affected children. Muss B.,Schwanitz G.

25812,"We report on a girl with prominent expressive language impairment, mi crocephaly, dental, ocular, anorectal anomalies and dysmorphic features. Array CGH analysis has revealed microdeletion of chromosome 22 spanning ~2.5 Mb at 22q11.21q11.22 (20,098,507 22,556,733 hg19). FISH analysis has confirmed de novo microdeletion origin. Huge variety of different size deletions in this particular site as well as high density of the genes in chro mosome 22 forms variety of phenotypes for the DiGeorge, VCFS and rela ted syndromes. Clinical features of our patient distinguish from DiGeorge syndrome, because deletion does not include HIRA and TBX1 genes. Mo reover, the deletion detected in our patient genetically and phenotypically distinguishes from previously reported central 22q11.2 deletions. Renal and urogenital anomalies that are common in patients with central 22q11.2 deletion have not been observed in our patient. Additionally, our patient has dental anomalies including hypodontia, abnormal shape and enamel hypoplasia of the central incisor which have not been reported in patients with similar deletions. The distal breakpoint of the deletion coincide with common central 22q11.2 microdeletion breakpoint while the proximal bre akpoint of the deletion is atypical and is located more proximally than in previously reported patients with central 22q11.2 microdeletion. Our case confirms the statement that deletions of 22q11.2 region do not represent a single clinical entity but vary depending on the specific mediating low copy repeats and the intervening gene content and emphasizes array CGH me thod as the most powerful diagnostic tool.",2016
25813,"Introduction: There are different 22q11.2 distal microdeletions, depending on the mediating LCRs (D to H). They vary in size and position but in lite rature they have been considered as a single clinical entity. Recently, a clas sification has been proposed based on size and gene content that proposes three different entities. They share some clinical features: Developmental delay, intellectual disability and mild dysmorphic features. One of them is a small deletion of about 700 Kb (LCRs E to F). This small deletion is usually a de novo event, is rare (only five patients reported in literature) and shows a milder phenotype without growth restriction or cardiovascular defects. Materials and methods: The patient was a 10 year old boy who was atten ded in Clinical Genetics Unit because of mild intellectual disability. Both parents were phenotypically normal (mother with hypothyroidism) and he was born after 40 weeks of uneventful pregnancy. He had normal develop mental milestones but learning difficulties at school. An array CGH analysis was performed using a 60K platform (Perkin Elmer). FISH with LSI BCR pro be was used in patient and parents. Results and conclusions: Patient had a deletion of about 700 kb in distal 22q11.2 region (LCRs E to F) that was inherited from an apparently normal father. This deletion is rare and usually a de novo event. We report the se cond patient with an inherited deletion of this region. Our patient supports that this deletion is characterized by a mild phenotype and can be inherited from an apparently normal parent.",2016
25814,"Introduction:Interstitial deletions of chromosome 22q11.2, including Di George and velocardiofacial syndrome, are the most common microdeleti ons. Recently, rare 22q11.2 distal deletion syndrome with distinct genomic and clinical features from DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome has been delineated. The 22q11.2 distal deletion syndrome is characterized by deve lopmental delay, pre and postnatal growth restriction, facial dysmorphism, and mild skeletal anomalies. We report a patient with phenotype compa tible with the 22q11.2 distal deletion syndrome and with novel phenotype, cutaneous hemangioma. Materials and Methods:A 3 year 11 month old male was referred for gene tic evaluation for moderate mental retardation and developmental delay. He had short stature, microcephaly, small forehead, high palate, tongue tie, clinodactyly, left cryptorchidism, and large strawberry hemangioma on his trunk. G banding karyotype using peripheral blood was normal. For scree ning of common microdeletion syndromes, multiples ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using P245 microdeletion syndrome probemix was performed. Results:MLPA showed heterozygous deletion only for one probe site in PPIL2 gene at 22q11.21, which located distal to common deleted region of DiGeorge syndrome. For confirmatory analysis of screening result, subse quent MLPA using P250 DiGeorge probemix showed heterozygous deletion for two additional probe sites located in TOP3B and HIC2 genes. The dele tion involved low copy repeats (LCR) 22 D region, distinct from recurrent deletion of DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome, and contained 51 genes. Conclusions:We have identified a rare 22q11.2 distal deletion syndrome case with previously unreported cutaneous feature. Our finding can expand our knowledge of the clinical spectrum of the 22q11.2 distal deletion syn drome. MLPA is an easy and sensitive analytical method to diagnose these small sized microdeletion syndromes.",2016
25815,"DNA methylation plays critical role for both embryonic development and tumorigenesis and is mediated through various DNA methyltransferases. Germline mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A cause peculiar form of overgrowth syndrome, Tatton Brown Rahman syndrome (TBRS). Somatic mutations in DNMT3A are causally associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and p. Arg882His represents the hotspot. Muta tion spectrum in TBRS and AML never overlapped to date. Furthermore, no patients with TBRS have reported to have developed AML. We report a livebirth and survival of an infant with the TBRS phenotype who had the germline de novo DNMT3A mutation at the AML somatic mutation hotspot p. Arg882His. The female patient had a birth weight of 3926 g (+2.2SD) and length of 54 cm (+2.7SD). Characteristic features included hypotonia, ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

At age 6 years, she had overgrowth with a weight of 29.2 kg (+3.2 SD) and a length of 125.8 cm (+3.1SD) and head circumference of 55cm (+2.8SD). Identification of the same variant (DNMT3A p. Arg 882 His) as both germline mutation associated with TBRS and somatic mutation associated with AML directly links mechanistic basis of the two diseases for the first time. We conclude that mutations responsible for TBRS and those for AML are likely to exert the same mode of action: decreased methyltransferase activity and reduced DNA binding activity. From a clinical standpoint, our observation indicates surveillance for hematologic abnormalities is needed among patients with TBRS.",2016
25816,"Introduction: Deafness, onchodystophy, osteodystrophy and mental retar dation (DOOR or DOORS) syndrome (OMIM 220500) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of unknown cause. Small or absent nails and hypoplastic terminal phalanges are seen in most individuals. The syndrome is also as sociated with seizure disorder. Approximately 50 affected individuals have been described in the medical literature. Half of the patients with all clinical features have mutations in TBC1D24. Materials and Methods: A 18 month old girl case born to a G3P2A1 female at term with NSVD as 2200 gr. Her parents were second degree consanguinous. Microcephaly, short neck, broad forehead, pointed chin, hypertelorism, high narrow palate, preauricular tag, flat nasal bridge, open nose wings, absent fingernails were determined in physical examination. Optometry, EEG and cranial MR results were normal in our patient. The patient had hearing loss, mental retardation and tonic clonic seizures for 7 times. Results: Cytogenetic analysis revealed 46,XX,inv(9)(p11q13) karyotype. We performed sanger sequencing for TBC1D24 (OMIM 613577) gene with deep intronic in house designed primers. We identified a homozygous sin gle base alteration c.1415 G>A (p. G428R) in TBC1D24 gene. This mutation was found in the probandÃ¢ÂÂs parents. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the c.1415 G>A mutation has not been re ported previously. The c.1415G>A was considered to be damaging by SIFT software, probably damaging (score 1.000) by Polyphen, and disease cau sing by Mutation Tester and the CADD scaled c score was 34.

The pro band is the first child of non consanguineous parents was born with birth weight 3900 g, height 59 cm. Anamnestially he had the surgeries of ano malous pulmonary venous drainage and the intestinal malrotation. At the age of 4, pre B ALL and secondary hyperparathyroidism were diagnosed. The following dysmorphic facial features were noted: mild ptosis, broad flat nose, down slanting palpebral fissures, opened mouth. His psychomotor de velopment was normal. Chromosome analysis revealed a mosaic karyotype 47, XY,+mar[85]/46,XY[15]. To further determination the chromosomal origin of the marker chromosome whole genome SNP array was carried out and identified a de novo 6.6 Mb gain at chromosome region 22q11.1 q11.22.

25818,"We present four cases of aberrations of the short arm of chromosome 9 de tected postnatally in children and the impact on their phenotype. We describe two cases of full trisomy 9p, one case of partial trisomy 9p and one case of tetrasomy 9p. In two patients isochromosome i(9p) and isodi centric chromosome idic(9q) were present. Only one aberration arosed as a consequence of balanced chromosomal tranlocation in mother all other cases were the novo. Patients were examined by G banding, FISH and CGH or array CGH. Trisomy 9p is a rare chromosomal syndrome (RethorÃÂ© sy) originally repor ted in the medical literature in 1970 and first proposed as a distinct syndro me in 1975. It is one of the most frequent autosomal rearrangements com patible with long survival rate. It arises either as a consequence of balanced CHA in parents or the novo and is asociated with mental retardation and characteristic facial dysmorphism. There is some discrepancy in the litera ture regarding the consistency of clinical features present with relation to the size of the duplicated segment. Tetrasomy 9 is a very rare chromosomal disorder first described in 1973 (Ghymers et al). Isochromosome or isodicentric chromosome is present in most cases. Phenotype features of tetrazomy 9p are variable among affected individuals including varying degrees of growth retardation, abnormal facial features, and mental retardation.

Clinically, the girl pre sented at the age of 23 months because of global developmental delay and failure to thrive. Birth weight, length and head circumference were in the normal range. After birth, difficulties of feeding and hypotonia were obser ved. Hereafter she developed moderate psychomotoric retardation. At pre sentation she showed short stature, microcephaly, dystrophy and unspecific craniofacial dysmorphism. Chromosomal analysis generated inconspicuous results. Array CGH analy sis uncovered a complex rearrangement with an interstitial 1,6 Mb deletion in 15q25.2 adjacent to a 607,9 kb duplication in 15q25.2 q25.3. The imba lances were confirmed by qPCR in the child and excluded in both parents. FISH analysis using two BAC clones revealed a small paracentric inversion (inv(15)(q25.2q25.3)) in the mother. Isolated deletions in 15q25.2 have already been described in individuals with intellectual disability. Inverted duplications associated with terminal deletions resulting in the loss of the subtelomeric region are reported for different chromosomes (Zuffardi et al. 2009). To the best of our knowledge an interstitial inverted duplication with deletion has been described only once in 1p36.1 (Milosevic et al. 2014). In contrast to our patient there was no predisposing chromosomal abnormality in both parents. We report on a rare case of interstitial inverted duplication with deletion of 15q25.2 q25.3 resulting from a maternal paracentric inversion.

Its characteristic clinical features are permanent neonatal or early infancy insulin dependent diabetes and later onset skeletal dysplasia. Other frequent clinical manifestations are hepatic and renal dysfunction, mental retardation, cardiac abnormalities, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, primary hypothyroidism and neutropenia. Although WRS is a rare disease, it is the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) in consanguineous families. The exact frequency of this rare syndrome is unknown because patients may die before showing the characteristic features of the syndrome. Case: This report presents a case of WRS in an 8 year old girl with neonatal diabetes and short stature whose elder brother died of diabetes mellitus at 2 months old age before having a molecular diagnosis. Results: We found a homozygous W522X mutation in EIF2AK3 gene in our patient which was only found in another two unrelated Turkish families. Discussion: W522X mutation in EIF2AK3 gene seems to be confined to Tur key and may be a common mutation in WRS patients from this country. In this paper, we compare the clinical features of the patients having W522X mutation with other patients reported to date. Except the characteristic features as diabetes mellitus and epiphyseal dysplasia, all the WRS patients show extensive phenotypic variability that correlates poorly to genotype which suggests that there is no correlation between any spesific mutation and the clinical manifestation.",2016

We report a fetus presenting with micromelia, narrow thorax with short ribs, and polydactyly of hands on ultrasound scan at 21 weeksÃ¢ÂÂ gestation. The pregnancy was terminated at this stage and autopsy revealed brachydactyly, postaxial polydactyly of both hands, short ribs, ab normally short long bones, and dysplastic iliac wings. Fetal tissue was coll ected fresh in order to perform molecular assays. Sequence analysis of the 21 coding exons of EVC gene revealed that the fetus was homozygous for a frameshift mutation, NM_153717.2:c.1388del;p.(Thr463Serfs*37). DNA from parental blood samples was analyzed to confirm the carrier status of the parents. Analysis of the samples showed that the mutation identified in the fetus was not present in the mother. The simplest explanation for this would have been a maternally inherited deletion. SNP array testing was performed to determine the gene copy number and analyze the haplotype in the 4p16.2 region in which EVC gene is located. The results showed no deletion, but the haplotype revealed the uniparental isodisomy of chromo some 4. Characterization of the homozygous nature of the mutation through parental genotyping and SNP array analysis allowed us to confirm that uni parental isodisomy of the paternal chromosome 4 carrying the mutated EVC gene played an etiologic role in the disease.",2016

Retinitis pigmentosa in combination with hearing loss can be a feature of different Mendelian disorders. We describe a novel syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in the Ã¢ÂÂexosome component 2Ã¢ÂÂ (EXOSC2) gene. Three individuals from two unrelated German families presented with a previous ly undescribed disorder encompassing childhood myopia, early onset reti nitis pigmentosa, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, hypothyroidism, short stature, brachydactyly, recognizable facial gestalt, premature aging, and mild intellectual disability. Whole exome sequencing revealed homozy gous and compound heterozygous mutations in EXOSC2 in all three patients who shared a large 6.7 Mb rare haplotype on chromosome 9 encompassing EXOSC2.EXOSC2 encodes the Ã¢ÂÂribosomal RNA processing protein 4Ã¢ÂÂ (RRP4) one of the core components of the RNA exosome. The RNA exosome is a multi protein complex that plays key roles in RNA processing and degradation. One of the discovered amino acid substitutions p. Gly30 by Valin located within the N terminal domain of EXOSC2 would change the inter atomic di stance between the mutated EXOSC2 residue and neighboring amino acids of EXOSC4 and, therefore, destabilize EXOSC2 EXOSC4 interaction. A similar mechanism was proposed for the recurrent mutation p. Gly31Ala in the NT domain of EXOSC3. Intriguingly, the EXOSC2 associated phenotype shows only minimal overlap with the previously reported diseases associated with mutations in the RNA exosome core component genes EXOSC3 and EXOSC8. Taken together, we report on a novel condition that is caused by altered RNA exosome function and expands the spectrum of clinical consequences of im paired RNA metabolism.",2016
25827,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder characterized by chromosomal instability, congenital abnormalities, pancytopenia, and predisposition to cancer. Though they play a role in DNA repair processes, the FA proteins are likely to have other functions. Indeed, FA cells show defective mitochondria associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. In order to provide insights into the role of FANCA, one of the FA proteins, we investigated its localization and found that it resides not only in the nu cleus and the cytoplasm but also in mitochondria. We also analysed its ex pression of in cells derived from patients. Unexpectedly, proteins affected by amino acid substitutions are stably expressed in the cytoplasm, suggesting that they could be hypomorphic, exerting some role in the mitochondria. Consistent with this hypothesis, the mitochondrial phenotype is less severe in cells carrying one or two missense alleles than in those completely lak king FANCA (null cells). The energetic and respiratory metabolism of mitochondria was restored or partially restored when null FANCA cells were transfected with wild type or missense mutant forms of FANCA, respectively, further strengthening the hypothesis of a role of FANCA in mitochondria. The potential role of the FA proteins in mitochondria has long been neglec ted despite evidence for defects of this organelle in FA cells.

Genetic analysis is performed on Ion Torrent PGM platform, and detected mutations and/or alterations considered to be pathogenic are verified by Sanger and screened in family for segregation with inheritance pattern. Results: 6 out of 14 alleles found to carry mutations. Two different homo zygous mutations (c.894 2A>G and c.4261 2A>C) in FANCA and one com pound heterozygous [(c.205+5G>T)+(c.761_764delAGCA)]mutations in BRIP1 gene are identified, accounting to three DEB positive patients.

The deletion was proved to be de novo by real time qPCR. Feingold type 2 is a very rare Mendelian syndrome, described in few pati ents worldwide. Our proband shows a never reported association between FGLDS2 and keratoconus. We noted that the 17.3 Mb deletion on chromoso me 13q partially overlap with the keratoconus 7 locus, identified by linkage analysis on Ecuadorian families (MIM614629). Thus we suspect that haplo insufficiency of a gene nearby MIR17HG, defined by the overlapping seg ment between our deletion and the linkage region is causing keratoconus. Nine genes are included in this segment. Among these, the best candidates are MBNL2 and IPO5. MBNL2 encodes a muscleblind protein responsible for terminal differentiation of muscle and photoreceptor tissues. IPO5 encodes a protein nuclear transport and it is expressed in human cornea.

The male patient presented with lobular holoprosencephaly with a single maxillary incisor, ectro /syndactyly on both feet, syndactyly on both hands, craniosynostosis of the sagittal suture, delayed puberty and develop mental delay. His younger sister was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus, in addition to syndactyly of the right foot and an aortic isthmus stenosis. A cra nial MRI showed agenesis of corpus callosum and colpocephaly. The novel synonymous missense mutation c.1029G>A (p. Ala343Ala) FGFR1 detected in both affected siblings, was excluded in DNA extracted from leukocytes of the parents and their healthy sister. Therefore, we assume a gonadal mo saicism or somatic mosaicism including germ cells of this mutation. In one of the FGFR1 isoforms this guanine to adenine substitution is located in a specific splice acceptor region, which we currently are functionally valida ting in vitro.",2016
25831,"Department of Genetics, Utrecht Medical Center University, Utrecht, Netherlands. Fraser syndrome (FS) is a rare autosomal recessive malformation disorder described for the first time in 1962. Major criteria are cryptophtalmos, syn dactyly, respiratory and urinary tract anomalies. Mutations have been iden tified within 3 genes, FRAS1, FREM2 and GRIP1, all involved in mesenchy mal epidermal adhesion during embryonic development. This descriptive study analyzed the prenatal ultrasound and fetal phenotype in 35 cases of FS. Termination of the pregnancy was performed in 24 cases, intra uterine death was diagnosed in 8 cases, between 16 and 36 weeks of pregnancy, and 3 cases died after birth. All cases presented dysmorphic features with nose and ear dysplasia. Complete or abortive cryptophtalmia and renal anomaly (agenesis, hypoplasia or dysplasia) were present in 34/35 cases, syndacty ly in 33/35, bronchopulmonary anomalies in 30/34, genital anomalies in 30/35, and sexual phenotype was frequently difficult to establish. Multiple anomalies were observed in the digestive tract: low set ombilicus (23/34), anal atresia/stenosis (16/33), intestinal malrotation (10/33) and ompha locele (6/35). Ultrasound results were available in 24 cases. Reported ano malies were oligoamnios (18), ascites (8), renal anomalies (19), broncho pulmonary anomalies (11), ophthalmologic anomalies (4), ear dysplasia (2) and syndactyly (2). The fetal and postnatal phenotype of FS is very specific, while ultrasound diagnosis is complicated by the presence of oligoamnios. This study shows that cardinal FS diagnosis criteria are rarely found on pre natal ultrasound. Evidence for low set ombilicus, microphtalmia, and genital anomalies should lead to consider the diagnosis of FS.",2016

Frontonasal dysplasia occurs in patients with various genomic abnorma lities, including chromosomal rearrangements, point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) affecting single genes. We examined two girls, aged 1 year and 5 months, with developmental delay, frontonasal dyspla sia, and other congenital anomalies. In addition to frontonasal dysplasia, the 1 year old girl had hypotonia, deformed low set ears, hemangioma of upper lip. In the 5 months old girl, additional phenotypic features inclu ded plagiocephaly, camptodactyly and umbilical hernia. Chromosomal mi croarray analysis (CMA) using SNP array (Affymetrix Cytoscan 750k) was performed as a first line test according to ACMG recommendations. Both girls appeared to have a copy number gain of EFNB1 gene: a 1 year old girl had 3 copies (molecular karyotype: arr Xq13.1(67,923,907 68,158,871)x3, size 235 kb), and a 5 months old girl had 4 copies (molecular karyotype: arr Xq13.1(67,863,904 68,457,240)x4, size 693 kb). According to the OMIM da tabase, point mutations and deletions (but no duplications so far) in EFNB1 gene were described in X linked dominant Craniofrontonasal syndrome (304110) with prevalence in female patients. The use of CMA allows identification of genes having clinically significant dosage effect associated not only with copy number losses, but with gains as well. This may lead to a revision in the testing strategy for patients with distinctive facial features.",2016

Mutations in ALX genes family are responsible for autosomal recessive (ALX1, ALX3, ALX4) or dominant (ALX4) FND. Cra nio fronto nasal syndrome (CFNS), acromelic FND and Teebi syndromes are caused by mutations in respectively EFNB1, ZSWIM6 and SPECC1L. Molecu lar basis of oculo auriculo fronto nasal (OAFNS), oculo cerebro cutaneous (OCCS) and Pai syndromes are not known. Materiel and methods: We report a series of 35 patients referred to sequence ALX genes. Sanger sequencing of ALX1, ALX3 and ALX4 was performed in 14 individuals and identified one ALX3 heterozygous mutation in one patient. Based on the phenotype, we identified 24 FND, 2 CFNS, 5 OAFNS, 2 OCCS, and 2 Teebi syndromes. Sanger sequencing of EFNB1 was performed in both individuals presenting with CFNS. Trio exome sequencing was performed in seven patients. Results: We identified de novo EFNB1 mutations in the two CFNS patients, as well as new mutations in known genes (YWHAE, OTX2 and SPECC1L) in patients respectively labeled as FND, OCCS and Teebi syndrome, and a de novo variant in a candidate gene in a fetus with FND. Replication cohorts are being sequenced.

The genetic causes are still unknown, but somatic mosaicism is suspected. Methods and Results: Our database includes 78 GSD and 52 GLA patients. All experiments included paired blood/tissue samples. Genomic dose ex periments (Illumina SNP BeadChips) did not detect common UPD/CNV re gions (germinal or somatic). Mutational screening using NGS experiments (Exome and TruSight One, Illumina), was performed in 18 patients. In house bioinformatics tools were developed to call somatic variants. A list of 578 candidate genes was obtained Ã¢ÂÂ48 were somaticÃ¢ÂÂ. No PIK3CA mutations Ã¢ÂÂknown to be associated to cystic LMsÃ¢ÂÂ were detected, but variations in other four PI3K associated genes were found. As a second step we designed a custom NGS panel with a 1.000X vertical coverage, including the 578 can didate genes as well as PIK3CA associated genes and other vascular/lym phatic genes. We present here a preliminary candidate gene list. Conclusion: Use of NGS Ã¢ÂÂat large reading depthsÃ¢ÂÂ and specific bioinforma tic algorithms for detecting somatic variations in paired blood/tissue samp les, is the appropriate methodology for gene discovery in entities caused by mutations in somatic mosaicism form. We have obtained a candidate gene list, including four PI3K associated genes, taking us closer to the cause of GSD/GLA.

25835,"Gorlin Chaudhry Moss Syndrome (GCMS; OMIM%233500), firstly descri bed in 1960 in two sisters, is a neglected condition reported in the medical literature in only seven females. GCMS associates craniosynostosis (coro nal), ectodermal dysplasia features including hair (diffuse hypertrichosis, synophrys, coarse hair) and teeth (abnormally shaped, hypodontia, mi crodontia) abnormalities, microphthalmia, conductive deafness, minor con genital heart defects and hypoplastic labia majora. All patients show normal intelligence. Although craniofacial manifestations are characteristic partial overlap with Saethre Chotzen syndrome exist. We report the eighth case of GCMS diagnosed at the age of 14 years. She was the second child of healthy unrelated parents born post term after uneventful pregnancy. At 10 weeks, she was hospitalized for marked craniofacial dysmorphism, cleft palate, bi lateral microphthalmia with cataract, interventricular and interatrial sep tal defects with patent ductus arteriosus. Growth was delayed. Cranial CT scan confirmed craniosynostosis involving the coronal sutures. At clinical examination diagnosis was suggested based on craniofacial characteristics including brachycephaly with midface hypoplasia, low frontal hairline, syn ophrys, microphthalmia, posteriorly angulated ears, bifid nasal tip, promi nent columella, dental abnormalities, arched narrow palate with bifid uvula, generalized hypertrichosis and short stature. Left cutaneous syndactyly of toes 2 3 was evident. We requested an audiogram revealing left sided con ductive hearing loss. GCMS is exceedingly rare with core features consisting in craniosynostosis, ocular and ectodermal derivatives defects.

Our patient is noted to have severe growth retardation, delayed bone age and mild deve lopmental delay. Also her mother has relatively low height. Investigation with whole genome oligonucleotide microarray CGH analy sis which was performed using clinical 60K microarrays from Oxford Gene Technology (CytoSure ISCA v2) revealed duplication spanning of approxi mately 180 kbp and between breakpoints rs9,955,335 and rs10,136,171 at 2p25.1.This duplicated region contains GRHL1, KLF11, CYS1 genes as well as a part of the TAF1B gene. Litteareture review revealed that GRHL1 gene plays an important role in epithelial development and epidermal differentiation. KLF11 is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and it is a glucose inducible regulator of the insulin gene. TAF1B is a component of RNA polymerase I core factor complex.

The syndrome presents with lymphedema, intestinal lymphangiectasia, intellectual deficit and facial dysmorphism. The diagnosis of Hennekam is suspected on the basis of cli nical phenotypic features. Phenotypic abnormalities relate to impaired pre natal and postnatal lymphatic flow resulting from mutations in the collagen and calcium binding EGF domain 1 (CCBE1) during lymphangiogenesis. In this study, we analyzed the DNA sequences of CCBE1 gene in a patient aged 3 years old with Hennekam syndrome. Materials and methods: The entire coding regions of the CCBE1 gene were analyzed for mutations by PCR based direct DNA sequencing. Results: One novel homozygous mutation IVS7(+12) A>G at position 640 on CCBE1 gene has been detected. The heterozygosity of the parents for this IVS7 was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. Bioinformatic analysis con firmed our studies. Conclusions: This mutation occurs in the deep intronic positions. Activation of an intronic cryptic acceptor site and creation of an intronic ESE site could be created by the mutation. Complementary assessment such as functional study should be considered for suggestion of prenatal diagnosis.",2016

25840,"Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a malformation sequence in which the cerebral hemispheres fail to separate into distinct left and right halves, resulting in midline structural anomalies of the central nervous system and face. Nu merous different heterozygous mutations have been identified in HPE pa tients, including missense, nonsense, deletion, and frameshift mutations located throughout the gene. In addition, in a recent study of over 200 pa tients with isolated HPE, 22% were found to have copy number variations (CNVs). However, the majority of etiologies of isolated HPE have yet to be determined. In the present work, the MLPA technique was performed in 52 individuals within the HPE spectrum who presented negative mutational screening test for the major HPE genes, and anomalies were found in seven cases. These aberrations included five deletions and two duplication in genes related to HPE. Three individuals had deletions involving SHH on 7q, one individual had a duplication involving SHH on 7q, one individual had a deletion on 18p involving the TGIF1 gene, and another individual had a duplication on 13q involving the ZIC2 gene. Our results also showed that microdeletions/du plications in the major HPE genes SHH, TGIF, and ZIC2 are causative for the frank HPE phenotype, being the SHH the major one ( 9.5% in SHH, 1,9% in TGIF, and 1,9% in ZIC2). As HPE patients are surviving longer, we believe that an effort to search for CNVs is a valuable tool for genetic counseling when analyses for mutations in the known HPE genes are negative.

Holt Oram syndrome (HOS) is a rare autosomal dominant heart hand syn drome due to mutations in the TBX5 transcription factor. A wide spectrum of TBX5 mutations has been previously reported, mostly resulting in null allele and haploinsufficiency, but some mutations also affect the nuclear lo calisation of the TBX5 protein or its interaction with co factors and down stream targets. TBX5 duplications have been previously reported in asso ciation with atypical HOS phenotypes. Ulnar Mammary syndrome (UMS) is also a rare autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in the TBX3 gene. Clinical variability is the rule for both HOS and UMS and incomplete penetrance has often been reported. Contiguous chromosome 12q24 deleti ons comprising both TBX5 and TBX3 genes have been identified but to our knowledge, mirror duplications have never been described.

25842,"Background: In 1993, Chitayat et al., reported a newborn with hyperpha langism, facial anomalies, and diffuse bronchomalacia. We have identified 2 more families with similar findings. Characteristic features include bilateral accessory phalanx resulting in shortened index fingers; hallux valgus; facial features including prominent eyes, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge and upturned nose; respiratory compromise due to bronchomalacia neces sitating ventilatory support; pectus excavatum. Methods: Trio based exome sequencing was performed in 3 unrelated fami lies. Putative de novo variants were identified from exome data using DeNo voGear software and validated using Sanger sequencing. Results: The same variant c.266A>G p.(Tyr89Cys) Refseq NM_006494.2 in ERF: de novo (Patient 1&2) and inherited from affected father (Patient 3), ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

Tyr89Cys is an aromatic polar neutral to polar neutral amino acid change, highly conserved across species and lies within the func tionally important ets domain of the protein. This variant has never been reported (1000 genomes, dbSNP build 144, EVS or EXAC). The recurrent c.266A>G p.(Tyr89Cys) ERF missense variant causes Chitayat syndrome. Discussion: ERF has been shown to suppress ets induced transformation and be regulated by phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle via ras/ MAPK signalling pathway. ERF variants have been associated with com plex craniosynostosis. In contrast, none of the patients with the c.266A>G p.(Tyr89Cys) variant have craniosynostosis.

25843," Infantile encephalopathies are a group of clinically and biologically hete rogeneous disorders for which the genetic basis remains largely unknown. Here, we report a previously unrecognized syndromic neonatal encephalo pathy characterized by profound developmental disability, severe hypoto nia, seizures, diminished respiratory drive requiring mechanical ventilation, brain atrophy, corpus callosum dysgenesis, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and facial dysmorphism. Biallelic inactivating mutations in TBCK (TBC1 domain containing kinase) were independently identified by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) as the cause of this condition in four unrelated families. Matching these families was facilitated by sharing phenotypic profiles and WES data in a recently released web based tool (Geno2MP) that links phe notypic information to rare variants in families with Mendelian traits. TBCK is a putative GTPase activating protein (GAP) for small GTPases of the Rab family and has been shown to control cell growth and proliferation, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, and mTOR signaling. Two of the three mutations are predicted to truncate the protein (c.376C>T [p. Arg126*] and c.1363A>T [p. Lys455*]), and loss of the major TBCK isoform was confirmed in primary fibroblasts from one affected individual. The third mutation, p. Arg511His, alters a conserved residue within the TBC1 domain. Structural analysis im plicates Arg511 as a required residue for Rab GAP function, and in silico homology modeling predicts impaired GAP function in the corresponding mutant. These results suggest loss of Rab GAP activity is the underlying me chanism of disease. In contrast to other disorders caused by dysregulated mTOR signaling associated with focal or global brain overgrowth, impaired TBCK function results in progressive loss of brain volume.",2016

We sequenced the exomes of the proband, parents, and all available affected and unaffected siblings. We performed pedigree based variant analyses and segregation in order to identify candidate disease genes. Results: As expected for founder populations, we identified known and no vel recessive disease genes, including a case of two recessive disorders se gregating together in this population. In addition, we have also identified se veral novel genes responsible for previously unreported rare disorders and novel variants in recently reported intellectual disability and developmental delay genes such as ARID1B, SETBP1, PURA, SYNGAP1, among others. Conclusions: We demonstrate the utility of genomic sequencing in indivi duals with genetic disorders and their family members to reach a fast and accurate molecular diagnosis and identify novel disease genes in the context of a relatively homogeneous genetic background provided by founder popu lations such as the Amish and Mennonites.

We investigated their possible occurrence in Joubert syndrome (JS), a ciliopathy characterized by a distinctive hindbrain malformation, and typically caused by biallelic muta tions in one of >25 genes. Methods: We sequenced 25 JS genes in 386 individuals with JS and 175 con trols using targeted capture and next generation sequencing. Results: Two rare deleterious variants (RDVs) in one JS gene were identi fied in 248/386 individuals (64%) (Ã¢ÂÂrecessively solved patientsÃ¢ÂÂ). We found no indication of triallelism, since 0/69 unaffected siblings carried the same two RDVs as their affected relative. We identified 24/138 unsolved patients with RDVs in Ã¢ÂÂ¥2 JS genes as candidates for oligogenicity, while 14/175 con trols carried RDVs in Ã¢ÂÂ¥2 JS genes. RDV types and patterns differed between unsolved patients and controls. Finally, we investigated whether additional heterozygous RDVs in JS genes, present in 108/248 (43%) solved patients, acted as genetic modifiers. Pair wise comparisons between samples sharing identical causal RDVs identified no correlation between number of RDVs and disease severity. Conclusion: Our data offer little support for triallelism or oligogenicity as clinically relevant alternative inheritance mechanisms in JS, and the num ber of additional RDVs in Ã¢ÂÂsolved patientsÃ¢ÂÂ does not correlate with pheno typic severity. In patients with possible oligogenic inheritance, future work will focus on identifying 2nd RDVs in genes with single RDVs and functional work to assess effects of candidate oligogenic and modifier variants.

25850,"Introduction: Kabuki (make up) syndrome (KABUK; OMIM 148920) is mainly due to autosomal de novo pathogenic variants. Distinctive facial fea tures and the degree of intellectual disability are broad making its clinical diagnosis difficult even for experienced clinical geneticists, in particular in Kabuki like phenotypes. Material and Methods: A representative cohort of Czech KABUK / Kabuki like patients was examined (2013 2015) by Sanger DNA sequencing, MLPA, array CGH, followed by next generation sequencing based (NGS) gene panel assays (TruSight One, Illumina). Correlation of molecular genetic and cyto genetic test outcomes was compared to the reliability of clinical diagnosis. In addition, 3D digital phenotyping of facial gestalt was carried to further characterise these patients. Results: In 24 KABUK / Kabuki like cases pathogenic variants in KMT2D were detected in 9 patients. Array CGH revealed likely pathogenic CNVs on chromosomes X and 15, respectively, in 2 patients. NGS detected likely pa thogenic variants in genes associated with intellectual disability (HUWE1, GRIN1 ), including genes coding for mandibulo facial dysostosis (EFTUD2, EDNRA ). Nonetheless, in 5 cases their underlying genetic etiology has not been elucidated, while in the remainder familial consent for further testing is pending. Conclusion: Array CGH and broad NGS based gene panels have a high dia gnostic yield in KABUK/Kabuki like phenotypes. Genomic testing may fo ster elucidation of otherwise ambiguous clinical diagnoses. 3D facial gestalt phenotyping proved to be a useful tool for further stratification of such pati ents and eventual prioritisation of detected variants.

25851," Introduction: Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is characterized by intellectual disa bility, hypotonia and distinctive facial features. It can be caused either by a 9q34.3 deletion that includes the EHMT1 gene or by a EHMT1 mutation. Several additional clinical findings have been observed in KS patients. We describe a case of an unusual prenatal presentation of KS with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), never reported before as part of the KS phe notypic spectrum. Case description: A 34 year old woman with unremarkable family and me dical history was referred to our department at 21 weeks of gestation of her second pregnancy for genetic counseling. The pregnancy was uneventful until 20 weeks of gestation when morphologic ultrasound detected mode rate left CDH, which was then confirmed by a level II scan. CGH analysis on amniocytes revealed a 3,9 Mb de novo deletion on 9q34.2 34.3 that included the EHMT1 gene. A female fetus was delivered vaginally at 35 weeks with a weight of 2100 g and an Apgar score of 9 10. Post natal echocardiography showed complex cardiac septal and valvular defects. She died a week after from cardiorespiratory failure. Conclusions: The deletion we detected also encompasses the COL5A1 gene, whose loss likely contributed to the development of CDH. CDH may thus be part of the phenotypic spectrum of KS due to deletions that extend over several genes; penetrance seems incomplete as the two cases previously reported in the literature with similar deletions did not develop CDH. As in our case, CDH presence may have a negative prognostic impact on the syndrome.",2016

Every method has its own advantages and disa dvantages, thus the diagnostic laboratory uses all methods in an order to make the correct diagnosis. Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplifica tion (MLPA) analysis is a method used in detection of deletions or duplica tions of genes. Here we report an 11 year old boy consulted to our depart ment due to mental retardation and dysmorphic features with a suggested diagnosis of Di George syndrome. Materials and methods: Peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures were set up as well as DNA isolation and following MLPA analysis. Results: The boy was the second child of a 41 year old mother and father. Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype. We did not detect deletion of the Di George region during analyses, however we detec ted a heterozygous deletion of EHMT1 gene which is used as a reference gene in the commercial kit (P250 B2 DiGeorge Lot No: 0614).Conclusions: MLPA method is a sensitive and handy tool for diagnosis of mi crodeletion syndromes as well as other conditions that result from genomic imbalances. We diagnosed the patient incidentally while looking for another abnormality. When we re evaluated the patient after the results, we obser ved the dysmorphic features were consistent with the diagnosis. Although coincidental findings might be harmful in some circumstances, in this ex ample off target effect of MLPA help us to make diagnosis.",2016

25854,"Introduction: Lacrimo Auriculo Dento Digital syndrome (LADD; MIM# 149730) is extremely rare, with only approximately 60 patients reported to date. It is caused by heterozygous mutations in FGF10, FGFR2, or FGFR3, which result in abnormalities of the eyes, ears, teeth and limbs. Phenotypic expressivity is highly variable and genotype phenotype correlations are not known. Here, we present the clinical and molecular characterization of a fe male patient with a novel likely pathogenic variant in FGFR2.Case Report: The 2 month old girl was referred to the Medical Genetics con sultation due to bilateral agenesis of the thumbs. She had low set, simple ears and a cup shaped right ear. Parents reported alacrimia and absence of lacrimal puncta was observed. Lower central incisors were peg shaped. Cli nical diagnosis of LADD syndrome prompted direct sequencing of FGF10, FGFR2 and FGFR3. A novel, de novo heterozygous missense variant was identified in FGFR2 (NM_000141.4): c.1928C>A, p.(Ala643Glu). Ala643 is conserved down to fruitfly and is in the tyrosine kinase domain of the fibro blast growth factor receptor. Bioinformatic prediction tools supported po tential pathogenicity of the change. We propose that p.(Ala643Glu) reduces the receptor activity via a dominant negative effect. Conclusion: This clinical case expands the spectrum of genetic variants that cause LADD syndrome. The confirmation of the clinical diagnosis enabled precise genetic counselling to the parents. Given a low recurrence risk, in the subsequent pregnancy, they opted to do prenatal diagnosis by ultra sound to exclude major malformations associated with LADD syndrome.",2016

25860,"Meier Gorlin syndrome (MGS) is a genetically heterogeneous microcephalic primordial dwarfism syndrome known to be caused by biallelic loss of func tion mutations in one of five genes encoding proteins involved in DNA repli cation initiation (ORC1 [origin recognition complex 1]/ORC4/ORC6/ CDT1 and CDC6). Thus far, mutations in these genes with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern have been established in about 80% of individuals with primary clinical hallmarks of MGS, including short stature, microtia and small/absent patellae. Recently, we identified de novo heterozygous (two truncating and one missense) mutations in GMNN by whole exome sequen cing, encoding the DNA replication inhibitor geminin in three individuals fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria of MGS. A gain of function mecha nism was shown to result in autosomal dominant MGS. The three indivi duals with de novo mutations in GMNN demonstrate a more severe growth retardation compared to 38 individuals with pre replication complex gene mutations, fullness of the peri orbital region, lumbar hyperlordosis and de velopmental delay and/or cognitive impairment, a rare finding in autoso mal recessive MGS. Based on the severity of the phenotype, we speculate that ORC1 and GMNN mutations might perturb DNA replication to a greater extent than the other MGS associated genes, and perhaps GMNN mutati ons have a more profound effect on the replicative burst and cell growth required for brain development, head size expansion, and height. The iden tification of autosomal dominant MGS caused by GMNN mutations expands the genetic heterogeneity of MGS, helps identifying the molecular etiology in additional individuals, and provides further insights into the relationship between DNA replication, cell growth, and organismal development.",2016

Opposite of this classical knowledge, heterozygosity for mutations in the BUB1B gene has been previously identified in 7 unrelated MVA fami lies. Here we present a new MVA family with heterozygous mutation in the BUB1B gene. Case: The proband was 11 year old male with severe microcephaly, intel lectual disability and EisenmengerÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome. Two siblings with the same findings had died. Results: Whole exome sequencing identified heterozygous c. C580T (p. R194X) mutation (maternal) in the BUB1B gene. Karyotype analysis showed various aneuploidies in 25% of his cells. The proband, mother and father showed 55%, 35%, 0% PCS cells in the lymphocyte culture, respec tively. There was no mutation in the CEP57 gene related with MVA2.Conclusions: The difference of PCS cells ratio of the proband (55%) and the unaffected mother (35%) shows that there is a relationship between PCS cell ratio and MVA phenotype. PCS cells are generally greater than 50% in MVA patients. Although, authors have focused on that the second allele haplotype 6G3 (26020GT , 1046GA, D15S994) may be associated with the MVA phenotype, G1046A (paternal) polymorphism was determined in the second allele in our proband.

Introduction. Since chromosome 19 is one of the most gene rich in a human genome, most of the rearrangements are severely deleterious or incompa tible with life. For instance, chromosome 19q13.11 microdeletion syndrome is generally associated with intellectual disability, speech disturbances, pre and post natal growth retardation, microcephaly, ectodermal dysplasia, and male genital malformations. Here, we describe a similar mosaic case. Materials and Methods. Cytogenetic and molecular karyotyping with bioin formatic analysis were used to address the case of an 8 year old boy with mild intellectual disability, ADHD, epilepsy, congenital malformations (i.e. pectus excavatum, hydrocele and inguinal hernia, flatfoot, sinus node dys function) and facial dismorphisms (low set dysplastic auricles, almond shaped eyes with downslanting palpebral fissures).Results. A mosaic 19q12q13.11 deletion (29,373,242 34,341,260) was de tected in about 70% of the cells (encompassing almost 5 Mb and 20 OMIM genes). Using bioinformatic analysis, we were able to define candidate genes for the index case: UQCRFS1 (involved in metabolic pathways and neurode generative diseases pathways), CCNE1 (involved in cell cycle, p53 signaling and PI3K Akt signaling pathways) and KCTD15 (a negative regulator of AP2 alpha regulating neural crest formation during early development).Conclusions. Despite the deletion at the 19q13.11 deletion syndrome regi on, neither the critical region nor most of the described cases have matched the deletion described. Additionally, since there have been no descriptions on similar mosaic deletions, we concluded that this is the first case of mosaic 19q12q13.11 deletion that lead to an atypical neuropsychiatric phenotype.

The ZEB2 gene encodes a transcription factor which is involved in the development of the neural crest and derived structures. We report on a 3 year old boy, born to healthy parents, presenting with a complex valvular heart defect, short stature, microcephaly, craniofacial dys morphia, absent speech and delayed motor development. Initial genetic in vestigations of Angelman syndrome (methylation assay, deletion /UPD te sting, sequencing of UBE3A gene) and Pitt Hopkins syndrome (sequencing and MLPA analysis of TCF4 gene) revealed negative results. We performed molecular genetic diagnostics of the ZEB2 gene consisting of Sanger sequencing and MLPA (multiplex ligation dependent probe am plification) analysis. By MLPA analysis we identified a heterozygous dupli cation of exon 9. Quantitative PCR confirmed this single exon duplication. Analysis of both parents revealed that the deletion had occurred de novo in the patient. By sequencing an RT PCR fragment we could demonstrate on RNA level that both copies of exon 9 are arranged in tandem. This dupli cation results in a translational frame shift and a premature translational termination signal. It has not yet been described in literature and databases.

At this moment, at least 10 genes of this pathway are reported in OMIM with a known phenotype. Methods: We recently diagnosed three patients with a PIG o pathy (PIGA, PIGV and PIGN) and applied an immunological assay for the expression of GPI coupled proteins, which allows for functional testing of variants of unknown significance in GPI bioanchor genes. Additionally, we made an overview of all clinical features that have thus far been reported in the lite rature in PIG o pathy patients and categorized them based on occurrence and pivotalness for the diagnosis. Results: The expression of GPI coupled proteins was reduced in our patient with two PIGN variants of unknown significance. Moreover, this patient sho wed persistent restricted diffusion in structures in the mesencephalon and diencephalon on brain MRI till 15 months of age. We here show that com mon features like severe developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures and more distinguishing pivotal features like elevated alkaline phosphatase, vesicou rethral reflux, hypoplastic nails and anorectal anomalies are associated with PIG o pathies. Conclusion: An immunological assay can be useful in the interpretation of variants of unknown significance in genes of the GPI bioanchor synthesis pathway. Moreover, as the common features in PIG o pathies are aspecific, the more pivotal features reported here may further help in establishing the diagnosis. Whether the observed brain MRI changes are specific for PIG o pathies remains to be elucidated.",2016

Our goal was to develop a single mutation screening strategy for these diseases. We set up a NGS assay based on the enrichment of 16 NER related genes by multiplex amplification coupled with sequencing on PGM(Ion Torrent). We prospectively analyzed the samples from an international cohort of 40 patients referred for suspected NER related disorder and we compared the corresponding phenotypes to our personal cohort of 126 NER patients pre viously characterized by classical sequencing. We identified causative mutations in 43% of cases, including patients with very mild, incomplete or combined phenotypes and uncommon genotypes (Table1). Four unrelated XP patients from the Basque country revealed a common splicing mutation in POLH demonstrating a new founder effect. We also identified two patients linked to the very rarely implicated genes ERCC3(XPB) and ERCC5(XPG) . Targeted NGS is efficient for the molecular diagnosis of NER related dis orders.

We detected parti al discordance of the phenotype, i.e. normal enamel and presence of some cafÃÂ© au lait spots which has not been described before. Conclusions: Phenotypes associated to NF1 duplication are highly variable and only few unspecific features like global developmental delay are shared by patients. Differences are probably due to small differences in additional microduplicated genes, while other features could be age related. Extensive follow up is warranted and, although clinically distinct from its reciprocal NF1 syndrome, careful evaluation of neurocutaneous symptoms is sugge sted.",2016
25870,"Introduction: The Nuclear Factor I X (NFIX) is a member of the nuclear factors I (NFI) family proteins, involved in gene expression regulation. De novo heterozygous variants in NFIX may cause two different syndromes: Marshall Smith syndrome (MSS; MIM #602535) or a less severe Sotos li ke phenotype, recently proposed to be referred as Malan syndrome (MIM #614753). The overgrowth phenotype (Malan syndrome) has recently been associated to NFIX haploinsufficiency due to point mutations clustered around exon 2 (which encodes the DNA binding domain) or due to who le gene deletions. Frameshift and splice site variants around exons 6 8 are thought to be causing a more severe phenotype as they may escape non sense mediated RNA decay. To date 25 mutations have been described in association to the MSS phenotype. Only 20 have been reported in relation to the overgrowth phenotype so far. Methods: We performed molecular analysis of the NFIX gene by conventio nal sequencing in a group of patients with overgrowth features but unclear clinical diagnosis. The effect of the mutations was predicted Ã¢ÂÂin silicoÃ¢ÂÂ by different bioinformatics tools. Results: 5 heterozygous mutations in the NFIX DNA binding domain were identified, 4 of them not previously reported. The patients showed some So tos like clinical features but no NSD1 abnormalities. All patients presented a significant delay in speech. Conclusions: Genetic testing of NFIX should be considered in patients with Sotos like features but no NSD1 alterations. To date the number of patients suffering from NFIX related diseases is scant, thus further studies will be necessary in order to establish a specific clinical phenotype.

The human exome represents 1 2% of the entire human genome and is esti mated to contain 85% of the mutations causing Mendelian diseases. Next generation sequencing (NGS) offers rapid sequencing of the whole exome compared to traditional molecular testing. Thisundoubtedly, contributes to significant advances in the study of etiology, origins, and causes of complex genetic diseases. NGS gives us the possibility not only to make previously unthinkable genetic diagnosis but also to reduce costs without affecting ac curacy. In this study, we present the genetic characterization of a patient with hete rogenous clinic using whole exome sequencing (WES). Our patient is a 12 years old girl (46, XX), phenotypically characterized by precocious aging since her childhood, hyperelasticity, cutis laxa, and in creased susceptibility to fractures. WES was carried out using the TruSight One kit (Illumina) that targets the coding regions of >4,800 genes associated with known clinical phenotypes (12Mb of the genome). All variants, detected at >20X depth and with >30% of heterozygosity, were annotated and classified according ACMG guidelines, and were prioritized considering our patientÃÂ´s phenotype. The exome analysis revealed a non previously reported nonsense change in homozygosis (c.190C>T; p. Gln64*) in the gene GORAB (MIM*607983). This GORAB gene had been previously associated with Geroderma Osteo dysplasticum (MIM#231070), an autosomal recessive disease that perfectly matches the phenotype of our patient. The targeted exome sequencing that analyses all known clinically relevant genes, is a useful tool for the genetic diagnosis in patients with heteroge nous phenotype in whom no clear genetic causes were suspected.",2016
25871,"Nonsyndromic clefts are a common birth defect of multifactorial etiology. The most common type is cleft lip, which occurs with or without cleft palate (nsCLP and nsCLO, respectively). The genetic architecture of both types is not yet fully understood. Here we performed a meta analysis on genetic and clinical data from three large cohorts and identified strong association between a region on chromo some 15q13 and nsCLP (P,8.13ÃÂ10 14 for rs1258763; relative risk (RR): 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.32 1.61)) but not nsCLO (P,0.27). The 5 kb region of strongest association maps intergenically between Gremlin 1 (GREM1) and Formin 1 (FMN1) genes. GREM1 is an antagonist in the BMP4 pathway which has been implicated in facial genesis. Based on analyses of the murine Grem1 expression pattern during embryonic craniofacial deve lopment, we further subdivided the nsCLP patient cohort and observed a more than two fold increase in risk for patients displaying clefts of both the lip and soft palate but with an intact hard palate (RR: 3.76, 95% CI: 1.47 9.61, Pdiff<0.05). Notably, in four of six multiplex families with rare muta tions in GREM1, the rare allele also co segregated with the clinical subtype.

25872,"Noonan syndrome (NS) is a multisystem disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding elements of RAS/MAPK pathway. The aim of our study was the identification of the molecular defect underlying NS phenotype in Po lish patients. The classic Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing techniques were applied to analyze only selected genes or exome /clinical exome, respectively. The mutations in PTPN11, SOS1 , RAF1 and RIT1 genes were identified in 115, 23, 16 and 7 patients, respectively. Among the identified mutations, several unpublished before were found including: familial variant in SOS1 p. Thr734Pro and de novo variants in RAF1 : p. Gly169Arg and p. Gly361Ala. Also two new variants in RIT1 were found: p. Gly31Arg and p. Lys23Glu in residues affecting protein structure or interaction with GTP/GDP , respec tively. Further Sanger sequencing of selected genes revealed the presence of mutation in KRAS and NRAS genes in 3 and 2 patients, respectively. A novel de novo variant p. Glu153Lys in NRAS gene was identified. Till now, the exome/clinical exome sequencing performed for 54 patients allowed to identify molecular cause of the disease in 20 (37%) patients, in cluding variants in genes related to RAS/MAPK pathway (eg. p.

25873,"Oculo auriculo vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a developmental disorder af fecting structures derived from the first and second branchial arches during blastogenesis. The phenotype is clinically heterogeneous and it is typically characterised by craniofacial anomalies (ear malformations, hemifacial mi crosomia, mandible anomalies, orofacial cleft), hearing loss, ocular defects (epibulbar dermoids, microphthalmia) and vertebral defects. There is also a high rate of associated anomalies in other organs/systems such as heart defects, renal and central nervous system malformations. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the OAV spectrum, ho wever, the mechanism and etiology are still poorly understood. Linkage and array analysis have detected several candidate loci for this genetically hete rogeneous condition (including deletions, duplications, unbalanced translo cations, partial trisomies of chromosomes 7, 8, 9, 10p, 22), but no recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been identified so far. The aim of our study is to identify candidate genes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. To achieve our goal we selected five un related patients presenting with the classical OAVS phenotype and without pathogenic Copy Number Variations (CNVs) detected by High Density SNP array (HumanOmniExpress BeadChip, Illumina, CA). Then, Whole Exome Sequencing analysis (Ion ProtonÃ¢ÂÂ¢ LifeTechnologies) was carried out in all patients.

25874,"X linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome (XLOS) is a midline multiple congenital condition characterized by facial dysmorphisms such as telecanthus/hyper telorism, broad nasal bridge and cleft lip/palate. Other features are variably present, including heart and anal defects, hypospadias, brain malformations and intellectual disability and/or developmental delay (ID/DD). Extensive inter and intra familial phenotypic variability was previously described particularly regarding the presence of ID/DD in XLOS patients, even when caused by the same MID1 mutation. MID1 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that specifically targets protein phosphatase 2A for degradation. Controlling protein phosphatase 2A is essential for proper hippocampus development. To date over 90 different MID1 mutations have been described and asso ciated with the presence of ID/DD in XLOS patients. We analyzed the coding sequence of the MID1 gene in eight male patients, pertaining to six unrelated families, with a clinical suspicion of XLOS. Two novel variants, c.1656del and a de novo c.1215_1228dup, were identified in four patients from two families. Interestingly, the patient with the de novo mutation did not present ID/DD, showing a global developmental quotient of 110.A descriptive statistical analysis of the specific clinical features of our two index patients and of those described in the literature with genotypic data (n,103), revealed no correlation between ID/DD penetrance and type of ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

25875,"Oral facial digital syndrome type 1 (OFD1) is an X linked dominant disorder caused by mutations in the OFD1 gene. This condition is characterized by facial anomalies and abnormalities of oral tissues, digits, brain and kidneys. Almost all affected patients are female, as OFD1 is lethal in males mostly in the first or second trimester of pregnancy. Although OFD1 is a disorder of the primary cilia, congenital heart defects are not frequently reported in both males and females with OFD1. Only a few cases were published this far, describing male OFD1 patients with a con genital heart defect. Here, we present a case of an affected male fetus with a pathogenic hemi zygous de novo mutation in OFD1 (c.2101C>T; p.(Gln701*)). Ultrasound examination demonstrated severe hydrocephalus, hypoplastic cerebellum and hypoplastic left ventricle of the heart. The pregnancy was terminated at 16 weeks of gestation. Post mortem examination of the fetus confirmed previous findings and also demonstrated polydactyly of both hands and one foot. By presenting this case of a male fetus with confirmed OFD1 and a conge nital heart defect, we would like to create awareness that congenital heart defects are included in the phenotypic spectrum of OFD1. This is especial ly of importance when prenatally multiple malformations are seen and the suspicion of OFD1 is raised, also when the family is unsuspected for OFD1. A clinical summary of this case and previous male OFD1 cases with a congeni tal heart defect will be demonstrated.",2016
25876,"Introduction: Osteoporosis Pseudoglioma syndrome (OPGG; MIM 259770) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder manifesting juvenile onset osteopo rosis and blindness. Affected individuals often have multiple bone fractures, particularly in spinal bones. Vision problems affect the retina and named as pseudoglioma since the conditions resemble an eye tumor known as retinal glioma. Mild intellectual disability, hypotonia, abnormal flexible joints or seizures are frequently associated with the disorder. It is caused by biallelic mutations in the LRP5. Here we reported a four generation consanguineous family in which three members, ranging between 19 and 28 years, were af fected by bilateral isolated microphthalmia. Materials and Methods: Homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing have been performed to clarify the genetic etiology of the bilateral isolated microphthalmia in this family. Results: The exome sequencing revealed a homozygous splice site mutation in LRP5 (c.2827+1G>A) in the index patient. Conclusions: Although no osteoporosis or bone fracture history in any of the affected members, dual energy X ray absorptiometry revealed osteoporosis in the spine in two examined affected members. Two sisters with compound heterozygous mutations in LRP5: c.889dupA and c.2827+1G>A associated with bilateral retinal detachment, microphthalmic eye, retro lental masses and reduced bone density have recently been reported. Thus, microphthal mia and reduced bone density observed in our family considered to be a component of OPPG syndrome. Taken together our study showed that iso lated microphthalmia can be the prominent symptom in a subset of OPPG families and, even no associated findings observed, bone mineral density measurement is essential for appropriate genetic counselling in such cases.",2016
25877,"Introduction: Overgrowth syndromes (OGS) comprise a group of conditions in which growth parameters are above of the mean and are usually accom panied by other clinical manifestations. In some cases, there is high over lapping between different OGS, making essential the molecular diagnosis. Material and Methods: We have designed a custom panel of NGS in which we included: i) genes responsible for any OGS, ii) genes related to the pa thways that leads to any disorder that resemble an OGS and iii) genes within a loci implicated in any overgrowth disorders described in the literature. Thus, 183 genes have been included. Eighteen patients, divided into tho se with clear phenotype but unconfirmed diagnosis (n,3) and those with non syndromic overgrowth and intellectual disability (n,14) were tested. One sample with known mutation and phenotype has been included as an internal control. Results: After variants filtering, fourteen mutations have been found in ele ven unrelated patients, five of which are causative genes for well known overgrowth syndromes. Otherwise, nine variants have been found in seven genes which are within a deletion or duplication syndrome with overgrowth and/or genes that act in several growth pathways but without a clear relati on between their mutations and phenotype abnormalities. Conclusions: Custom NGS panel of genes of overgrowth disorders is an ex tremely cost effective tool to diagnose those cases in which there is high clinical overlapping between different syndromes and also gives the possi bility to find mutation in genes from growth pathways that could explain the phenotype in undiagnosed cases of non syndromic overgrowth.

Materials and methods: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were used for DNA isolation. aCGH analysis was carried on by Roche NimbleGen 630K array ISCA Plus Cytogenetics array and was analyzed by Nexus 7.5 software. The LSI TEL/AML1 ES Dual Color translocation probe was used for detection of tetrasomy 12p mosaicism. Results: The girl was the second child of nonconsanguineous parents. She had dysmorphic features including frontal bossing, round face , sparse scalp hair, low set abnormal ears, wide nasal bridge, short nose, long filtrum, thin upper lip, everted/thick lower lip, short neck. We detected copy number gain on short arm of the chromosome 12 encompassing about 34.5 Mb by aCGH. This data was also approved by FISH. However, FISH analysis revealed that the patient carried 10% mosaic i(12p) in lymphocyte cultures. Conclusions: As a result the patient was diagnosed as Pallister Killian syn drome. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were utilized for FISH to confirm dia gnosis, so we did not perform invasive skin biopsy. This finding approved the previous reports suggesting that aCGH analysis may be enough to make diagnosis Pallister Killian syndrome without any invasive applications.",2016

The sorrowful parents were convinced by the genetic councilor, that further genetic investigations were indicated and agreed to Array CGH analysis. A mosaic tetrasomia 12p causative for Pallister Killian Syndrome was detected. All symptoms of the child could be assigned to this diagnosis. Further involvement of eyes, skin and lungs could be excluded. The diagnosis of this severe and rare chromosomal disorder was explained to the parents, and their question, whether there had been a diagnostic fai lure during pregnancy was appeased.

However, the mouse homolog of PDKCC , Vlk, is a hedgehog target that interacts with Gli3 to regulate chon drocyte differentiation. A patient with suspected Pallister Hall syndrome had a deletion at 2p21 that included only the PDKCC gene suggesting that haploinsufficiency for this gene may mimic a mutation in GLI3. The mother was a 33 year old obese G8P4034 with bicornuate uterus and diet controlled gestation diabetes mellitus A1 (HgA1c 5.5) from 30 weeks gestation. The patient was prenatally diagnosed with transitional AV canal, right ventri cular hypoplasia, cleft mitral valve with regurgitation and pulmonary valve hypoplasia. Amniocentesis revealed a normal karyotype and microarray. Birth weight was 3476 grams, head circumference was 36.5 cm (98 th%ile). After delivery other anomalies were: macrocephaly, central polydactyly of the left hand, preaxial polydactyly of the hallices, hypoplastic nails, facial dysmorphism, absent gag reflex, increased tone of the upper extremities. Pallister Hall syndrome was suspected clinically but the GLI3 gene analysis was normal. MRI of the brain showed mildly enlarged ventricles and sulci with irregular gyri. The prenatal microarray report was amended after de livery, identifying a 94 kb deletion at 2p21 of the PKDCC gene. Parental mi croarrays are pending.

Introduction: In PROS, PIK3CA germline and postzygotic mutations consti tutively activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway causing congenital segmen tal overgrowth, while are absent in surrounding healthy tissues. MTOR inhi bitors are empirically tested in these patients. We aim to assess the effects on PROS patient derived cells of pathway blockage upstream of mTOR by the potent and selective allosteric AKT inhibitor ARQ 092, an experimental drug with activity and long term tolerability in many cancer patients, being also tested in Proteus patients. Materials and methods: We performed targeted deep sequencing of pa thway genes in six PROS patient derived cells to identify causative muta tions and immunoblots to assess the phosphorylation status of AKT and its downstream targets (pS6, pPRAS40, pFOXO3a, pBAD, pGSK3ÃÂ± ÃÂ²). Anti pro liferative effect of ARQ 092 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors (wortmannin, LY294002, syrolimus) was evaluated, with or without serum, in PROS cells from six patients. Results: ARQ 092 potently inhibited Akt signaling and exerted a strong anti proliferative effect by inducing cell death more efficiently than comparators, with 50% of surviving cells after 60 hours of treatment with 5 uM dose. Conclusions: Our data show that PROS cells are Ã¢ÂÂaddictedÃ¢ÂÂ to AKT and PROS treatment benefits more of AKT than mTOR inhibition.

Hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 8 (HLD8) with hypo dontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (also known as 4H syndrome) is caused by mutations in POLR3B. AIM: To describe two patients from the same family with cerebellar hypoplasia and mutations in POLR3B. CASE REPORT: A 22 years old male was diagnosed at the age of 5 with cerebel lar hypoplasia and endosteal sclerosis. He had microcephaly, short stature, myopia, dental dysplasia, hypogonadism, scoliosis, ataxia, intention tremor and psychomotor retardation. His 5 years old cousin had myopia, astigma tism, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, hypodontia, and ataxia. Her brain MRI showed cerebellar hypoplasia and hypomyelination. Endosteal sclerosis was not present in the girl. Whole exome sequencing was carried out in both patients and the unaffected parents of one of them. The patients were compound heterozygous for two likely pathogenic variants in POLR3B: NM_018082.5:c.[1568T>A]+[2974G>A]; NP_060552.4:p.[V523E]+[G992S]. The p.

POH is characterized by progressive ossifications of dermal, skeletal muscle and deep connective tissues during childhood, whilst PHP1A is characterized by resistance to PTH in association with fea tures of Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO).Patients and Methods: First family, 28 years old woman presented with cutaneous calcifications from early childhood followed by deep tissue tu mors. Her daughter was neonatally diagnosed with congenital hypothyroi dism, but as she grew features of AHO and PTH resistance were noted. In the second family, a 30 years old female presented with cutaneous calcification from infancy which than progressed into deep tissues. Her 3.5 years old son was diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism, PTH resistance, AHO phenotype and he presented epilepsy with calcification of the basal ganglia.

It is caused by mosaic mutation of (PI3K) AKT signaling pathway. Features are asymmetrical overgrowth of limbs, hyperostosis, ce rebriforme connective nevi, skeletal deformities, benign and malignant tu mors, capillary vascular malformations and deep venous thrombosis. Case report: We report a 15 years girl with a severe expression of PS. She had serious deformities of skull, thorax, arms, hands, feet, macrodactyly, scoliosis, various deep vein thrombosis, ovaries cystadenoma and bullous pulmonary disease. Then she showed progressive respiratory failure, be havior changes, depression, headaches, fatigues. Brain MNR showed severe hyperostosis and two lesions like meningioma, with significant compressi on on the midbrain, brain parenchyma and cerebral edema, hydrocephalus. The severe progression of lesions determined respiratory failure and pati ent death. Conclusion: CNS malformations and meningioma have been previously re ported in patients with PS. Because of brain tumor late diagnosis and severe complications, therapy has been extremely difficult and patient died. The PS prognosis varies depending on the severity of complications. Patients should be examined regularly and annual physical examination and radio graphy is also recommended. An appropriate follow up are most important, but extreme rarity of PS makes very difficult the multidisciplinary approach. References:Gilbert Barness E, Cohen MM Jr and Opitz JM.

This novel variant was not observed in the variant databases and segregated as expected within the family. Discussion: We have identified a possible new syndrome characterized by ID, dysmorphic features and palmoplantar lipomatosis, caused by a novel stop homozygous mutation in a gene not previously reported as causal. Alt hough further analysis is necessary, almost all protocadherin family genes are widely expressed in the brain and play important roles in its develop ment and function, what could support its pathogenicity. Due to the associa tion of ID and deep creases, Pierpont, Coffin Siris and Wiedemann Steiner syndromes should be regarded as differential diagnoses. Our report empha sizes the clinical utility of WES in patients with undiagnosed ID .",2016
25888,"Introduction: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare, autosomal reces sive disorder, characterized by ectopic mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers of connective tissues, leading to skin, eye and cardiovascular system symptoms. PXE is caused by loss of function mutations in ABCC6, coding a membrane transporter of unknown function. Methods: A comprehensive molecular analysis of 306 French PXE probands diagnosed using the Phenodex score, was performed (including Sanger sequencing of all exons, Long range PCR focusing the recurrent multiexo nic deletion, and MLPA). Topography of the mutations was analysed, and genotype phenotype correlation analysis was performed in patients with 2 mutations: group H (haploinsufficient, 2 predicted loss of function vari ants), group M (predicted residual conservation of the transporter function, 2 missense mutations) and group HM (one of each type of variants).Results: Molecular analysis led to the identification of 142 distinct mutati ons with 66 novel mutations and a detection rate of 88%. Significant results were found: (1) Mutations distribution was specific to some regions and re sidues of the transporter (p,0,005), (2) a more severe ocular and vascular phenotype exists in patients in groups H and HM than in group M (p,0,05), (3) renal lithiasis and strokes, which are not included in the Phenodex score, were found respectively in 11 and 10% of cases. Conclusion: This is the largest cohort ever published and characterized, and we propose a revised Phenodex classification, as well as personalized care and prevention based on the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ molecular status, enhancing vascular follow up in patients with complete haplo insufficiency of the gene.",2016
25889,"Germline mutations in genes of the RAS/MAPK pathway induced the activa tion of a cascade of events causing proliferation, differentiation, survival and cell death. Clinical consequences in patients including: short stature, conge nital heart defects, facial dysmorphism, developmental delay and ectoder mal anomalies among the most significant that are known as RASopathies. We compiled all patients diagnosed with RASopathies during the last 45 years in our Clinical Genetics Department to characterize their phenotype genotype correlation. In total we have diagnosed 144 patients with clinical features compatible with RASopathies. In 55 of them we found the causative molecular defect. In 37 patients mutations in PTPN11 were found (4 familial, and a Leopard phe notype in one case); 9 patients showed SOS1 mutations (2 familial); 3 had mutations in BRAF (all sporadic cases with phenotype cardio facio cuta neous); 1 in the NRAS; 2 in RAF1 (both sporadic); 1 in RIT1 (sporadic) and 1 in SHOC2 (sporadic). CGH array revealed one partial duplication in RAF1 (0,07Mb). A comprehensive phenotype genotype correlation was perfor med.

However, many of that features overlap with clinical findings described in the other genes in the RAS/MAPK pathway making specific diagnosis more difficult.",2016
25890,"Introduction: RASopathies represent a group of clinically and molecularly intersecting disorders comprising the Noonan syndrome (NS), NS with mul tiple lentigines (NSML), Noonan like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH), CBL mutation associated syndrome, cardio facio cutaneous syndro me (CFCS), Costello syndrome (CS), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and Le gius syndrome (LS). These clinical entities are due to pathogenic variants in RAS/MAPK signalling pathway genes. Overlap of phenotypic features makes clinical diagnosis challenging, while molecular genetic analysis fosters etio logical diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Targeted analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, RIT1, BRAF, KRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, HRAS, SHOC2, CBL, RRAS, SPRED1 and NF1 by Sanger and/or HaloPlex enrichment assay (Agilent Technologies, USA) fol lowed by next generation sequencing (MiSeq platform; Illumina, USA) in a representative group of 162 unrelated Czech cases with clinically diagnosed NS or related disorders, excluding NF1 and LS, was performed. Results: Altogether, pathogenic variants were found in 69 (42.6%) of all cases and NS confirmed in 59 patients. Four patients were diagnosed with NSML, in 3 cases pathogenic variants indicating CFCS were detected and HRAS variants associated with CS were revealed in 2 instances. One patient was diagnosed with NS/LAH. All detected substitutions were missense, one variant in RIT1 is novel.

The Martinez Frias syndrome is characterized by pan creatic hypoplasia, intestinal atresia, and gallbladder aplasia or hypopla sia, with or without tracheoesophageal fistula. When the patient also pre sents neonatal diabetes, it is called Mitchell/Riley syndrome. Materials and methods: We report a family case of Mitchell Riley syndrome/ Martinez Frias syndrome with a genetic mutation in RFX6. The patient is a healthy pregnant woman in her 26 weeks gestation (G3P2). Her first daugh ter, born of non consanguineous gipsy parents, had a pancreatic hypoplasia, intestinal atresia and neonatal diabetes. She died at 17 months. This child was diagnosed of mrs/mfs and showed a homozygous missense mutation on exon 4, c.541C>T , p. R181W. The patient and her couple are heterozygous. Second daughter is heterozygous and showed at birth intestinal atresia that was surgically corrected. In last pregnancy, the fetus showed polihydram nios and Ã¢ÂÂdouble bubbleÃ¢ÂÂ suggestive of duodenal atresia.

25892,"Rhombencephalosynapsis (RS) is a rare cerebellar malformation defined by vermian agenesis with fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres. In most cases, RS presents as a sporadic condition consistent with de novo dominant muta tions. In sporadic forms, RS occurs in isolation or in combination with other cerebral and extra cerebral malformations. The association of microlissen cephaly with RS has never been reported so far. Moreover, the molecular bases of non syndromic forms of RS remain unknown. Using comparative index case parents exome sequencing strategy, we iden tified a heterozygous de novo missense variant in the ADGRL2 gene in a fe tus affected with RS, microlissencephaly and growth retardation. ADGRL2 encodes latrophiline 2, an adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor whose exogenous ligand is ÃÂ± latrotoxine.

25893,"Whole exome sequencing of a patient with intellectual disability and wit hout recognizable phenotype yielded a mutation, c.3779+1G>A, in the in tron20 splice donor site of CREBBP . Mutations at different positions within the same intron20 splice donor site, were observed in 3 patients clinically suspected as having Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RSTS). All mutations were de novo and likely disease causing. To investigate a putative difference in splicing between the patient without RSTS phenotype and the three pati ents with RSTS phenotype, we analysed the effects of these mutations on splicing of the pre mRNA of CREBBP . As no RNA of patients was available, we generated a new and improved exon trap vector, pCDNAGHE, and tested the effect of the various mutations on splicing in vitro. All mutations lead to skipping of exon20. In one of the patients with an RSTS phenotype there was also some normal splicing detectable. In conclusion, we describe a patient with a CREBBP mutation with intellec tual disability and a phenotype not resembling RSTS. Three other patients in whom the diagnosis RSTS was clinically suspected, also carry a mutati on in the same splice donor site. However, the splicing pattern obtained by exon trapping cannot explain the phenotypic differences and suggests the involvement of modifying genes, altering the expressivity of the disease phe notypes.",2016
25894,"Nucleolar organizer regions and satellites are located on the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. There are several reports of satellited non acrocentric chromosomes. Sometimes, the ectopic NORs are attached to a terminal chromosome band as a result of balanced or unbalanced rearran gements that, depending on the particular type of rearrangement and the chromosomes involved, will be associated with phenotypic abnormalities or constitute rare familial polymorphisms. Up to our knowledge, the present report describes the most distal 15q ter minal deletion informed to date and the second associated with NOR tras location. We report on a 21 years old patient with short stature and mild intellectu al disability. The patient presented IUGR, hip dysplasia, feeding difficulties. Clinical assessment showed nail hypoplasia, widening halux, cubitus valgus and venous sinus corona radiata. She failed to complete first school. The GTW (550 bands) banding technique showed a terminal deletion at 15q26.3 and NOR staining confirmed the presence of ectopic stalks. MLPA technique confirmed the subtelomeric deletion and arrayCGH analysis re vealed that the anomaly involved a 4.6 Mb deletion. Parental karyotypes were normal. It is difficult to establish a phenotype / genotype correlation due to the few reported cases of 15q terminal deletion. Pre and postnatal growth retarda tion seem to be a regular clinical feature and could be related to haploinsuf ficiency of the IGF1R gene. We emphasize the value of the right combination of cytogenetic and molecular techniques for the characterization of NORs ectopic regions.",2016
25895,"Somatic mutations in genes of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway causing seg mental overgrowth may be present in very low percentages. This can hinder the identification of causal mutations. Sanger sequencing, but also standard NGS diagnostic pipelines, are able to identify mosaic mutations with a detec tion limit of approximately 10%. Targeted analysis of specific sites is most commonly used for a more sensitive detection of mutations. With the gro wing number of known causal mutations there is a need for a high sensitive mutation scanning method to analyze the complete coding sequences of the genes involved rather than analysis of hotspots. We have developed a NGS based gene panel test for segmental overgrowth (AKT1, AKT3, MTOR, PIK 3CA, PIK3R2, PTEN, TSC1 and TSC2), especially for the detection of low level mosaicism. Samples are sequenced with high coverage (average 1500 2000 reads, minimum 500 reads) and an analysis pipeline was developed that is able to detect mosaic mutations as low as 1%.",2016
25896,"Mutations of the SHOX gene are common cause of various genetic growth disorders, including isolated short stature, LÃÂ´eri Weill syndrome and Langer syndrome. LÃÂ´eri Weill syndrome characterized by short stature, mesomelia and Madelung deformity. We describe 10y old girl with disproportionate short stature and mesomelic shortenings of the limbs. On X ray examination shortening of the distal por tion of the extremities and deformity in distal epiphysis of radius was seen. The patient was diagnosed LÃÂ´eri Weill syndrome together with the clinical findings and SHOX FISH analysis planned. The index patientÃ¢ÂÂs father, sister and paternal aunt showed disproportionate short stature and mesomelic shortenings of the limbs but her brother was normal stature. Their chromo some analyses were normal but metaphase FISH with a SHOX specific probe showed a deletion of the SHOX gene on the X chromosome in the female in dex patient, her sister and her paternal aunt but in the index patientÃ¢ÂÂs father FISH showed a SHOX deletion on the Y chromosome. The deletion was originally located on the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs Y chromosome but trans mitted to daughterÃ¢ÂÂs X chromosome by crossover during meiosis. The index patientÃ¢ÂÂs sister and paternal aunt have SHOX deletion on X chromosome. Interestingly, the index patientÃ¢ÂÂs brother FISH analysis was normal. This means that a crossover has occured between the X and Y chromosomes in the fatherÃ¢ÂÂs spermatogenesis. After crossover, the father transmitted X chro mosome with SHOX deletion to both daughters but transferred normal Y chromosome to son. This family is presented as clinical evidence of crossover in the SHOX gene.",2016

It is caused by point mutations or genomic rearrangements in the glypican 3 gene (GPC3).We report on two girl sibs and their mother with SGBS. The first girl was born without macrosomia. She had a macroglossia that spontaneously re gressed. She died from post surgical complications of a hepatoblastoma at age three. Her sister was born after a pregnancy marked by polyhydramnios. She had macrosomia, macroglossia, nephromegaly and diffuse hepatome galy. Wiedemann Beckwith syndrome was excluded. A novel c.213_214insC heterozygous missense insertion (p.

The patient is currently followed on a yearly basis with abdominal ultrasound scan, and screened for tumoral markers and urinary catecholamins. The mo ther is asymptomatic. Females with mutation in GPC3 can express SGBS. Dysmorphic features, ma crosomia, diaphragmatic hernia, and developmental delay have been repor ted. Lyonisation has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for variab le expression of SGBS in female patients (Yano 2011). SGBS predisposes to embryonal tumors. In males, the risk has been estimated at 8% (Cottereau 2013). Cancers were only reported in two affected females: one low grade ovarian carcinoma, and one breast cancer.

So far, only two patients with mutations in SNAP25 have been described in the literature by whole exome sequencing; Rohena et al. (2013) identified a de novo SNAP25 mutation in an 15y old patient suffering from hypotonia, MR and epilepsy, and more recently, Shen et al. (2015) describe an 11y old pa tient who was suffering from MR, joint contractures, weakness and ataxic dysarthria. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo SNAP25 missense muta tion. Here we describe a third patient with a de novo SNAP25 mutation. The patient was stiff at birth and had multiple joint contractures. First seizures were observed at the age of 2m. Epileptic encephalopathy was suggested after MRI imaging. He died at the age of 1y. As the result of the complex syndromal phenotype of the patient, trisomy 18 was suggested, however karyotyping and array CGH testing showed a normal karyotype. Multiple ge netic disorders were then suspected. Sequencing of a set of genes involved in theses syndromes revealed no causative mutation. Finally, trio exome se quencing was performed in an attempt to identify a genetic cause. We were able to identify a de novo SNAP25 mutation, p.

25899,"SOX10 is a transcription factor with well known functions in neural crest and oligodendrocyte development. Mutations in SOX10 were first asso ciated with Waardenburg Hirschsprung disease (WS4; deafness, pigmen tation defects and intestinal aganglionosis). However, variable phenotypes that extend beyond the WS4 definition are now reported. The neurological phenotypes associated with some truncating mutations are suggested to be the result of escape from the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway; but no mechanism was suggested for missense mutations, of which approxi mately 20 have now been reported. Here, we present two sporadic and one familial cases with mutations affecting the proline 175 of SOX10, presenting with WS2 (WS without HSCR) and an unusual peripheral and central pro gressive neurologic phenotype, including psychiatric diseases. Interestingly, these mutations, as well as one affecting the adjacent amino acid, all lead to specific subnuclear relocalization of the resulting proteins in vitro. In deed, mentioned mutants co localize in foci with the Drosophila behavior human splicing (DBHS) protein family members, including p54NRB, known as a paraspeckle marker and new SOX10 partner. Of note, the co transfec tion of wild type and mutant SOX10 constructs led to the sequestration of wild type protein in observed foci and altered synergistic activity between SOX10 and p54NRB. We propose that such dominant negative effect may contribute to or be at the origin of the unique progressive and severe neuro logical phenotype observed in affected patients. This new molecular/cellu lar mechanism could underlie the unique phenotype associated with some SOX10 missense mutations, and possibly other genes involved in related or unrelated pathologies.",2016
25900,"Introduction: STAR syndrome is a rare X linked disorder characterized by toe Syndactyly, Telecanthus, Anogenital malformations, and Renal malfor mations (OMIM: 300707). There are only ten cases described in the litera ture, all of which have loss of function variants in FAM58A . Seven of these cases have a de novo variant in FAM58A , while there are only two inherited mother daughter pairs described. Materials and Methods: The patient was delivered at term and was noted to have ductus arteriosus, bicuspid aortic valve, and bilateral 3 5 toe syn dactyly at birth. She is currently 8 years of age and has a history of tethered cord, neurogenic bladder, learning differences, esotropia, and unilateral sen sorineural hearing loss. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother and maternal half sister have similar clinical histories with congenital heart defects, syndactyly, and ano genital malformations; however there are differences in phenotypic severi ty. Clinical whole exome sequencing (WES) was completed at Baylor Miraca Genetics to identify the genetic syndrome in this family. Results: WES revealed a novel variant, c.651G>A (p. W217X), in FAM58A , identified in both the patientÃ¢ÂÂs mother and half sister as well. This family re presents the 11 13th cases described with STAR syndrome, and represents the third instance of familial inheritance. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a nonsense vari ant in FAM58A described in patients with STAR syndrome, and represents the third family with inherited disease. This family highlights that tethered cord and hearing loss should potentially be added to the phenotypic spectrum of STAR syndrome and shows the phenotypic variability of this syndro me amongst family members.",2016

This family confirms very recent gene identification study reported by Filges et al. Case: A 3 month old girl was hospitalized due to prenatally diagnosed mi crocephaly, microphthalmia and dysmorphological features. Parents had a history of previous child with the same findings and `apple peel` intestinal atresia as an additional finding.

Patients with this microdeletion present mainly with microcephaly, short neck, broad nose, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia and seizures, and retinal anomalies. Materials and Methods: We report on a 9 years old girl, with unilateral choanal atresia, eye leucoma, facial dysmorphism, and muscular hyperto nia at birth. Since 3 months of age she developed an epilepsy. At 9 years of age she presented with: severe mental retardation, short stature, micro cephaly, low weight, low frontal and occipital hair lines, narrow forehead, downslanting palpebral fissures, Ã¢ÂÂbeak likeÃ¢ÂÂ nose, short, broad and slightly flattened philtrum, maxillary prognathism, high arched palate, low set ears, long neck with retroflexion, deformed chest, thoracolumbar scoliosis, long fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and increased muscle tone. A screening for most common microdeletions, subtelomeric deletions and duplications, was performed using multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. Commercial MLPA kits (MRC Holland) were used for detecting imbalance at the subtelomere regions of chromosomes; each kit consists of one probe for each subtelomere. Results: A 6q terminal subtelomeric microdeletion was found, involving the PSMB1 gene. Conclusions: In rare subtelomeric deletions is quite hard to establish clear phenotype genotype correlation, as very small differences in the length of the affected region could change the spectrum of presented features. Our case is specific because of the lack of hypotonia, short neck, broad nose, reti nal abnormalities, which are considered so far as major presentations of 6q subtelomeric deletion syndrome.

Methods: We sequenced the exome or screened the exons of SYNGAP1 in a total of 251 patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. Molecular and clinical data from patients with SYNGAP1 mutations from other centers were also collected, focusing on developmental aspects and the associated epilepsy phenotype. A review of SYNGAP1 mutations published in the lite rature was also performed. Results: We describe 17 unrelated affected individuals carrying 13 diffe rent novel loss of function SYNGAP1 mutations. Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1 related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviors in eight patients. Hypotonia and unstable gait were frequent as sociated neurological features. With the exception of one patient who ex perienced a single seizure, all patients had epilepsy, characterized by falls or head drops due to atonic or myoclonic seizures, (myoclonic) absences, and/or eyelid myoclonia. Triggers of seizures were frequent (n,7). Seizures were pharmacoresistant in half of the patients. The severity of the epilepsy did not correlate with the presence of autistic features or with the severity of cognitive impairment. Mutations were distributed throughout the gene, but spared spliced 3Ã¢ÂÂ and 5Ã¢ÂÂ exons.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is a cardiomyopa thy disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the genetic basis of congenital HH and ARVD/C in a consanguineous Bedouin family of nine members with two affected brothers. Materials and Methods: Genotyping was done on the parents and two affec ted children. Exome sequencing was performed on the DNA of one brother. Results: The homozygous chromosomal regions contained 39 variations, reported in less than 10% of population variation databases. Following bio informatics predictions for damaging effect, segregation in the family and analysis of prevalence in the Bedouin population, one candidate remained in the Tax1 (human T cell leukemia virus type I) binding protein 3 (TAX1BP3) gene. The variation Ile33Thr substitutions is predicted to change the struc ture of PDZ domain that mediates protein protein interactions and affected the stability. Conclusions : The new clinical syndrome could be mediated by damaging the interaction of TAX1BP3 with the Potassium Channel KCNJ4 and impro per function of the Wnt signaling pathway in which TAX1BP3 was suggested to participate.",2016

Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 14 is the underlying cause of TS. Isolated methylation defects and paternal deletions of imprin ted locus 14q32 could be found in other TS cases. We present a case of TS in a 4 years old girl with some atypical features. The patient was born at the 35th weeks of gestation with weight 1832g ( 1.5SD) and length 42cm ( 2SD). Pregnancy was complicated by IUGR and oligohy dramnios. Shortly after the birth AVSD, congestive heart insufficiency and kyphoscoliosis were diagnosed. During the first years of life, the child had feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, hypotonia and severe psychomotor developmental delay. Later, dysmorphic features, body asymmetry, increa sing linear pigmentation on the arms and legs, hyperopia, strabismus and cognitive delay were noted. She started to walk independently at 2.5 years of age. Her height now is 5SD, weight and OFC 2.5SD. UPD7 UPD14 MS MLPA analysis revealed a complete hypomethylation of MEG3 gene (14q32.2).

25907," Background: Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a genetic disease characterized by development of hamartomas of multiple organs (brain, kidneys, retina, skin, etc.). TS prevalence in Russia approaches to 1:30000, however TSC1/2 mu tation distribution has not been subjected yet to systematic studies. Material and methods: DNA samples of 53 patients with clinical signs of tu berous sclerosis were tested for mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 genes using Sanger sequencing and MLPA. The vast majority of cases (50 of 53) were sporadic, i.e., no clinical signs of TS were detected in the parents. Results: TSC1/2 mutations were detected in 46/53 patients (87%): 34 (74%) carried mutations in the TSC2 and 12 (26%) in the TSC1; this ratio is in agreement with data obtained in European countries and the USA. It is of note that mutations were detected in 5 of 7 patients with one major and 0 1 additional minor features. All but one alteration were unique; splice site mutation TSC2 c.138+1G>A was found in 2 unrelated patients. Large rear rangements (exon deletions/duplications) were found in 5/46 (11%) and affected exclusively TSC2; this is substantially higher compared to estimates done in other studies (0.2 6%).Conclusions: Tuberous sclerosis in Russian patients appears to have some peculiarities: 1) domination of sporadic form of the disease; 2) absence of recurrent mutations; 3) high frequency of large rearrangements. Some patients with mutations had only one major diagnostic feature; thus, relaxed clinical criteria should be applied for justification of TSC1/2 muta tion testing.

Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is one of the most common types of autoso mal dominant syndromic hearing loss and is characterized by association with pigment disturbances of hair, skin and iris. WS is clinically classified into four subtypes (WS1 4) depending on the presence of additional fea tures. Mutations in 5 major genes of the neural crest pathway are found in this syndrome: MITF, PAX3, SOX10, EDNRB and its ligand EDN3. Neverthe less, a large number of cases still remain unexplained at the molecular level, notably in WS2 (70%). Whole Exome sequencing was performed in order to enhance the understanding of the molecular basis of WS2. In a sporadic case (sequenced in trio), we were able to identify a missense variation in EDNRB, a gene previously involved in WS4, but with a different mode of transmission. Screening of our WS2 cohort led to the identification of 6 additional cases with mutations in this gene: 4 missense changes, one frameshift and one splice site mutation. Immunofluorescence experiments performed on the mutants and wildtype proteins (as well as previously de scribed mutants and polymorphic missense changes as controls) revealed three mutants localizing in the cytoplasm instead of the membrane in diffe rent cell lines. A minigene was constructed for the splice site mutant and the resulting cDNA conserved 4 intronic base pairs, predicting a frameshift with early stop codon. In vitro functional tests are being conducted to analyze the transcriptional and post translational regulation of key players in the melanocytic pathway upon over expression of each mutant.",2016
25908,"Weaver syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by pre and postnatal overgrowth, spectrum of developmental delay, advanced bone age and characteristic craniofacial morphology. It is caused by constitutional he terozygous EZH2 pathogenic variants. The majority of cases thus far reported appear to have been sporadic and there is not much data available regarding long term follow up of adults with EZH2 related Weaver syndrome or clinical variability in rare familial cases. Here we present three individuals from a previously unreported family identified to have a novel EZH2 variant. Proband is a 7 years old boy with developmental delay, moderate intellectual disability, behavioral problems, increased pre and postnatal length, soft and doughy skin, broad thumbs, hipertrichosis and distinctive craniofacial dysmorphic features: macroce phaly, broad forehead, flat occiput, long philtrum, large ears, widely spaced eyes and horizontal chin crease. His 29 years old mother and 55 years old maternal grandmother are both of a tall stature and have similar craniofa cial morphology although no evidence of intellectual disability. Sequence analysis of EZH2 detected in a proband and then confirmed in mother and grandmother a novel, heterozygous variant c.2050C>A (p. Arg684Ser) in the highly conserved SET domain. It is likely to be patho genic based on the fact that it segregates with the overgrowth phenotype in reported family and that recurrent substitution of the same amino acid residue Arg684 in EZH2 by a different amino acid is well known to be pa thogenic. In summary, we expand the mutational spectrum of EZH2 related over growth and point out to clinical variability in rare familial case. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25909," Introduction: Weaver syndrome (WS) (MIM #277590) is an overgrowth disorder characterized by pre and postnatal overgrowth, variable learning disability and distinctive craniofacial features. It is also characterized by ad vanced bone age (usually carpal osseous maturation), camptodactyly and an increased frequency of tumours. The prevalence of WS is still unknown due to the scant number of cases reported up to date. In 2011, mutations in the Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) were associated with the development of WS. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that acts as the catalytic agent of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and it is also involved in the PI3K/mTOR pathway which includes other genes implicated in different overgrowth disorders. Material and methods: We performed molecular analysis of EZH2 in 23 pati ents with a clinical diagnosis of WS. Genomic DNA was extracted from peri pheral blood, and mutational analysis by conventional sequencing was per formed. Variants pathogenicity was evaluated through bioinformatics tools. Results: We found three different missense mutations affecting conserved domains of the protein. Two of them were not previously reported and are located in the SANT domain which is involved in DNA binding. All three pati ents showed clinical features compatible with WS. To date, only one of them developed a tumour. Conclusions: WS is a rare disease with few cases reported in the literature. In this study we described two new variants probably associated to the de velopment of this disease. Additionally, one of the mutations appeared in a patient who developed a neuroblastoma early in the infancy. Grants: FIS15/1481",2016
25910,"Opitz C Syndrome (OTCS, MIM #211750) is a rare and severe pathology of unknown genetic cause and unclear pattern of inheritance. It presents with malformations and developmental delay and clinically overlaps with the more severe Bohring Opitz Syndrome (BOS, MIM #605039). In BOS, half of the patients bear de novo truncating mutations in the ASXL1 gene. We studied 14 families with patients diagnosed as OTCS or BOS, from diffe rent countries. ASXL1 was sequenced in all of them and 6 patients (and their parents) were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES).We found an ASXL1 mutation in one Scottish BOS patient. In a Spanish OTCS patient we found a de novo truncating mutation at the imprinted and maternally silenced MAGEL2 gene. The mutation was present on the paternal chromosome. Other truncating mutations in this gene have been found associated with the Shaaf Yang syndrome and with severe ar throgryposis, suggesting clinical heterogeneity for MAGEL2 . In an Italian OTCS patient we found a de novo mutation at a FOXP1 splice site, associated with developmental delay, speech impairment and contractures, all traits present in the patient. Finally, two Russian OTCS sibs were reevaluated and re diagnosed as af fected with congenital myopathy and two recessive RYR1 mutations were identified by WES. Selected variants in the exomes of the other three patients are currently being validated. Our results suggest that OTCS is a highly genetically heterogeneous patho logy.

At present, the standard prenatal genetic diagnostic screening tool for foetu ses with ultrasound abnormalities is microarray analysis. However, recently, in patients with intellectual disability and/or developmental delay (ID/DD), next generation sequencing, proved to be a much better tool, it demonstra ted in about 20% of the cases the disease causing aberration. In our study we investigated whether whole exome sequencing (WES) could also be a promising tool to unravel the underlying defect for foetuses with ultrasound abnormalities. Nine foetuses with a severe, unexplained ultrasound abnormality and their unaffected parents (trios) were postpartum included in our series of pati ents for WES. The exome sequences were analysed with a stringent post se quencing annotation pipeline including an ID/DD gene panel of ~700 genes for filtering of the data. Analysis of the whole exome was only performed when informed consent was available and the gene panel did not reveal a candidate mutation. All remaining variants with a potential clinical conse quence were validated by Sanger sequencing. In 33% of the cases we were able to identify the causal genetic variant. In conclusion, WES demonstrates to be the a good diagnostic tool to unravel the underlying genetic cause in a substantial portion of the foetuses with severe ultrasound abnormalities.",2016
25912,"Introduction: Popliteal pterygium syndrome is a congenital malformation that includes orofacial, musculoskeletal and genitourinary anomalies. It is caused by mutations in the IRF6 gene and characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance, incomplete penetrance and variable expression. Clin ical manifestations may include from lower lip pits or mounds to cleft com plete palate with the presence of cutaneous webbing across one or more major joints in the lower extremities. Presentation case: Pregnant woman in the first trimester of pregnancy comes to genetic counselling consultation, because six months ago she had an abortion after detecting the presence of bilateral cleft lip with cleft pal ate and low mobility of the lower limbs in the foetus. After fetal autopsy, the diagnostic suspicion is a popliteal pterygium syndrome by the characteristic nail dysplasia. The IRF6 gene sequencing is performed, and Cys84Arg muta tion is detected allowing the study of the carrier parents. Conclusion: The joint assessment of the multidisciplinary team and the cor rect diagnostic orientation determined by the fetal autopsy has provided an accurate genetic diagnosis. Although the spectrum of mutations of IRF6 gene has an incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, it has been possible to offer a correct and detailed genetic counselling to the progeni tors on the current pregnancy.

25913,"The significance of genetic profiling in patients with ALL has been under lined by recent discoveries which have led to novel risk stratification sub groups and new treatment approaches, overall increasing Event Free Sur vival rates. Here we evaluate the efficiency of high resolution aCGH+SNP analysis when compared to conventional karyotype. We studied bone marrow samples obtained after diagnosis from 8 children (median age 7 years old) with B cell and B cell precursor ALL (n,3 and n,5 respectively), that presented with normal or non diagnostic conventional karyotype and are part of a larger cohort. Following DNA isolation we uti lized the high resolution aCGH+SNP 2X400K platform (Agilent Technolo gies), that covers the entire genome with an average resolution of 7kb for CNVs, and can also identify regions of LOH. The results were compared to conventional cytogenetic techniques and assessed in the light of the clinical outcome for each patient. Clinically relevant CNVs were detected in 7/8 cases (87.5%). The most com mon aberrations involved the ETV6 gene (n,5). One case with hyperdiplo idy (54 chromosomes) and one case with hypodiploidy (37 chromosomes) were also detected, with the smallest CNV detected being a 28kb deletion involving PAX5 gene. Aberrant genomic regions harbored hematopoiesis (RUNX1), cell cycle regulation (CDKN2A/2B), as well as oncogenes and tu mor suppressor genes. Additionally, regions with LOH were identified, en compassing important genes (IKZF1, RARA).We conclude that in a plethora of cases conventional cytogenetic techniques may not accurately depict the genetic profile of ALL patients in the clinical setting, increasing the necessity for additional approaches like CMA.",2016
25914,"Introduction: Isochromosome of the long arm of the derivative chromosome 17, originating from the translocation t(15;17) [ider(17)(q10)t(15;17) or ider(17q)] in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is a very rare chromoso me aberration which has been associated with a poor prognosis. Materials and Methods: We report two APL patients, their clinical and labo ratory data associated with ider(17q). Cytogenetic analysis was performed on unstimulated bone marrow cells. Chromosomes were examined with modified Giemsa stain HG banding technique. Interphase and metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies were performed on bone marrow cytogenetic specimens which were previously used for karyotype analysis. Detection of PML RARA and RARA PML fusion genes were perfor med using the DF SureFISH 15q24.1 together with the DF SureFISH 17q21.2 probes. Detection of p53 gene was performed using LSI TP53 (17p13.1) probe. DNA probes were applied following standard procedures outlined by the manufacturer. An RT PCR assay was performed to detect the PML RARA fusion gene. Results: Cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow cells of both patients showed mosaic karyotype with the ider(17q) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) was positive for long (L) isoform of PML RARA fusi on transcript. FISH analysis confirmed extra copy of RARA PML fusion gene or ider(17q) and loss of the normal tumor suppressor p53 gene in both of the patients. Conclusions: Results both of the reported APL cases with ider(17q) indica ted that the duplication of der(17) gives a growth advantage to the relevant clone which becomes dominant. Moreover, loss of the normal tumor sup pressor gene p53 may also contribute to this growth advantage.",2016

25916,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Our aim is to study if molecular characteristics of polyps can add information about risk of metachronous advanced neoplasia. METHODS: We retrospectively included 308 patients diagnosed with co lonic polyps (2007 2009) who have at least one surveillance colonoscopy made more than 6 months after the baseline, until 2014. 995 polyps were collected and tested for somatic BRAF(V600E) and KRAS(codons 12, 13) mutations. Patients were classified into 3 subgroups based on mutational profile of their polyps at baseline: 1) non mutated polyps, 2) at least one BRAF mutated polyp or 3) at least one KRAS mutated polyp. RESULTS: 661 polyps were classified as adenomas (66.4%), being 0.8% BRAF mutation and 11.6% KRAS mutation. 334 (33.6%) polyps were clas sified as serrated lesions: 281 (84.1%) HPs, 38 (11.4%) SSP , 8 (2.4%) TSA and 7 (2.1%) MP . A 39.4% of serrated polyps showed BRAF mutation, and 20.9% KRAS mutation. 289 patients could be classified in three mutatio nal profiling groups: 14.9% were considered as BRAF mutated, 22.8% as KRAS mutated and 62.3% did not present any mutation in these markers. In univariate analysis, KRAS mutation was associated with development of metachronous advanced polyps(KRAS: 30.3%; BRAF: 16.3%; non mutated: 15.6%; p , 0.029), more specifically advanced adenomas(KRAS 21.2%; BRAF 9.3%; non mutated 10.0%; p,0.049). This association is also obser ved in the multivariate analysis, adjusted by age and sex(OR: 2.267, 95% CI: 1.152 4.461).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the presence of KRAS mutation in polyps at baseline is an independent risk factor for the development of metachro nous advanced lesions.

25917,"Background. Patients with multiple colorectal adenomas may carry germ line mutations in APC or MUTYH, but mutation detection rate seems to be declining. The aims of this study were (1) to assess the proportion of these mutations in patients with multiple adenomas and (2) to identify risk fac tors that predict mutation detection. Methods. We performed mutation analysis of APC and/or MUTYH in a Dutch cohort of 1933 patients ascertained from family cancer clinics between 1992 and 2015. Risk factors were examined using (multinomial) logistic regression analyses. Results. The overall detection rate declined from 54% before to 14% after 2004. The proportion of APC /MUTYH carriers in patients with <20 polyps was low (3.5%;25/722). Only one mutation was identified in the patient group (n,198) of 10 19 adenomas diagnosed at age 60<. A younger age at adenoma diagnosis and a first degree relative (FDR) with polyps was asso ciated with higher odds of finding an APC mutation, but CRC in a FDR was not.

25918,"On a sample of 55 astrocytic brain tumors we determined the expression and localization of sFRP3 modulating molecule throughout different mali gnancy grades. Immunohistochemistry followed by digital scanning (Nano Zoomer 2.0RS, Hammamatsu), and ImageJ (NIH, SAD) program were me thods of choice for determining the levels of sFRP3 expression. Our results demonstrated that the differences between expression levels and malig nancy grades were statistically significant. Moderate (P,0,014) and strong (P,0,028) nuclear expression levels were significantly different with pilocy tic and diffuse astrocytomas showing higher expression values. When we di vided our sample into two groups, both moderate and high cytoplasmic ex pression levels were significantly higher in glioblastomas than in the group comprising astrocytomas II and III. We also showed that high grade tumors had lower values of moderate (P,0,002) and strong nuclear (P,0,018) ex pression comparing to low grade tumors. Analysis of cytoplasmic staining showed that strong cytoplasmic expression was significantly higher in the astrocytomas III and glioblastoma group than in astrocytomas I and II group (P,0,048). Moreover, we found that lower grade astrocytomas had fewer membranous SFRP3 stain than higher grade astrocytomas and that this difference was significant (P,0.036). Our results demonstrated that SFRP3 protein expression levels decreased when located in the nucleus in higher astrocytoma grades, indicating expected behavior as an antagonist of Wnt signaling, whereas when located in the cytoplasm an increase in SFRP3 ex pression was noted in high grade as compared to low grade astrocytomas. This may suggest that SFRP3 can also act as an agonist of Wnt signaling pro moting invasive behavior.",2016

Basal cell carcinoma of the skin (BCC) is the most common malignant neo plasm in humans. BCC is primarily driven by aberrant activation of the So nic Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. However, its extensive phenotypical variation remains to be explained. The genetic profiling of 293 BCCs revealed the highest mutation rate observed in cancer (65 Mutations/Mb), with strong prevalence of UV light signature mutations. 85% of BCCs harbored mutati ons in Hh pathway genes: mutually exclusive PTCH1 (73%) and SMO (20%) (P,6.6x10 8), SUFU (8%), and in TP53 (61%). 85% of BCCs also harbored additional driver mutations in other genes implicated in BCC tumorigenesis. Recurrent driver mutations were observed in MYCN (30%), PPP6C (15%), STK19 (10%), LATS1 (8%), ERBB2 (4%), PIK3CA (2%), RAC1 (1%) and N/K/ H RAS (2%). Loss of function (LoF) and deleterious missense mutations were observed in PTPN14 (23%), RB1 (8%) and FBXW7 (5%).

It is inherited in a dominant manner and characterized by the presence of benign hamartomas of hair follicles (fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas), lung cysts, spontaneous pneumo thorax and increased risk for renal neoplasm. Materials and Methods: 17 families from our Hereditary Cancer Program were analyzed. Genetic testing identified FLCN deleterious mutation in 10 families. To date 30 patients were detected as carriers, all of them are under follow up. Pathology reports were reviewed in order to classify skin lesions and renal neoplasms. Base line Thoracic CT scan to detect pulmonary bullae was indicated, and renal MRI was performed in all patients to screen for renal tumors. Results: Focusing on carriers: 21 (70%) have coetaneous affectation (15 have biopsied fibrofolliculomas/trichodiscomas); 8 (26%) developed pneu mothorax and 7 were diagnosed of renal cancer (2 cromophob, 3 clear cell and 2 pending pathology results) and kidney sparing surgery could be per formed for >3cm lesions. Only one patient shows the triad symptoms (skin, pulmonary and renal manifestations). Three carriers did not manifest any lesion, all of them were under 38 year old.

25921,"Introduction: Bladder cancer (BC) is the fourth commonest male malignan cy and one of the most expensive human cancers to manage. The majority of tumors are urothelial carcinoma in histologic type. Although many reports detail genetic events in urothelial cancer, alterations of epigenetic gene re gulation are also important in this disease. Epigenetic gene regulation may occur directly or indirectly through noncoding RNA (ncRNA) species. To date, few data have reported the role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in urothelial cancer and little is known of their function. Material and methods: The expression of 17112 lncRNAs and 22074 mRNA was determind using microarrays in 83 normal and malignant urothelial samples (discovery step) and selected RNAs with qPCR in 138 samples (va lidation step). Significantlly differentially expressed RNAs were identified and stratified according to tumour phenotype. siRNA knockdown, functio nal assays, and whole genome transcriptomic profiling were used to identify potential roles of selected RNAs. Results: We observed upregulation of many lncRNAs in urothelial cancer that was distinct to corresponding, more balanced changes for mRNAs. In general, lncRNA expression reflected disease phenotype. We identified 32 lncRNA with potential roles in disease progression. Focusing upon a promi sing candidate , we implicate upregulation of AB074278 in apoptosis avoi dance and maitenance of a proliferative state in cancer through a potential interaction with EMP1, a tumour supressor and a negative regulator of cell proliferattion.

PIEZO1 is a MSC protein and it is encoded by PIEZO1 gene in humans. PIEZO2 is a close ho molog of PIEZO1. We aim to evaluate PIEZO1/PIEZO2 expression in post natal period (P0 1) in mice bladder tissue as developmental and bladder cancer (BCa) tissue of mouse and human. Material/Methods: The detection of developmental expression was perfor med in P0,P7,P14,P21,P28,P36 and P90 in bladder tissue of BalbC strain mice. Mice were divided into BCa group(n,40) and control group(n,10). BCa in mice was created by using N butyl N (4 hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN). A total of 50 subjects were included in the study (40,BCa patients, 10,controls). After histopathological evaluation for BCa, expression of PIE ZO1/2 genes were examined by RT PCR and immunohistochemistry in tu mor and normal tissues. Results:PIEZO1 expression increased 21th and 90th days whereas PIEZO2 expression increased 7th day and decreased 90th day as developmentally. It was found in situ carcinoma in 14 samples, adenocarcinoma in 6 samp les and benign proliferative changes in 10 samples in mice. Comparing with control group, it was detected significantly increase in expression of PIE ZO1/2 in cancer groups in human and mice. Immunoreactivity had been observed against PIEZO1/2 both human and mouse bladder tissue with normal or cancer. Conclusions: The developmental changes in spesific days of PIEZO expressi on is demonstrated to play role in BCa development.

25923,"Diffuse gliomas are the most common brain tumors and comprise astrocy tomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas (WHO grades II III), and glioblastomas (grade IV). Lower grade gliomas (LGG, grade II III) have high ly variable clinical behavior that is not adequately predicted on the basis of histological classification. Assessment of the genome aberrations will pro bably allow more robust and prognostically relevant classification of these tumors. We performed genome wide analyses of 126 samples of gliomas (100x LGG, 26x glioblastoma) with the aim to investigate the genetic and epigenetic background of different tumor subtypes. The tissues taken from primary tumors were analyzed using I FISH with VYSIS probes (Abbott), SNP array (Illumina), and MLPA (MRC Holland) to detect recurrent chromosomal ab errations, copy number variations, IDH mutations and hypermethylation of MGMT and MMR genes promoters. Mutation of IDH genes was detected in 75.0% LGG. A total of 41.3% LGG patients with mutated IDH had simultaneous co deletion 1p/19q, which is considered the indicator of better response to radio chemotherapy. Ac quired UPD17p was proven in 65.0% of astrocytomas and 23.1% of gliobla stomas. In 46.2% glioblastomas, shattering of different chromosomes (chro mothripsis) always in combination with complex changes was observed. In 39.0% LGG, new recurrent finding hypermethylation of MLH3 gene pro moter was detected. In our study, patients with LGG and hypermethylated MLH3 had significantly longer OS (p,0.001).In conclusion, molecular cytogenetic diagnostics is a powerful tool to obtain prognostically relevant information in glioma patients and therefore should be an integral part of examination in patients with brain tumors.

Variant analysis was done by GensearchNGS software (PhenoSystems) and the NextGENe CNV detection tool (Softgenetics).Results: Coverage was at least 50 fold across 93% of all investigated coding regions. We focused on protein truncating mutations since functional data on other variants in these genes are scarce. In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, we detected pathogenic mutations (class 4 and 5) in the genes: ATM, CHEK2, NBN, PALB2, RAD51D, BRIP1, TP53, PTEN, CDH1, MSH6, FANCA, FANCC, FANCI, FANCM, XPC, ERCC2, RECQL4, SLX4, WRN, BLM, BUB1B, PMS1 and SBDS. CNVs were found in BRCA1, BRCA2, NBN and WRN. Conclusions: We identified monoallelic, likely pathogenic mutations in DNA repair genes other than BRCA1/2 in about 10% of HBOC cases. However, the causative association to HBOC and the prospective tumor risks for many of these mutations and genes have yet to be determined. Of note, extending the analysis to a larger number of genes proportionally increases the number of variants of uncertain significance and the workload to survey and classify them.",2016
25925,"Introduction: Breast cancer has been associated with mutations in other low and high penetrant genes except of BRCA. This knowledge allow us to identify more women at risk for breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to compare PCR Amplicon Workflow (BRCA HC MASTR Plus) which detects mutations and CNVs in 26 Ã¢ÂÂbreast cancerÃ¢ÂÂ genes and TruSight Enrichment Workflow (TruSight cancer) which targets 94 Ã¢ÂÂcancerÃ¢ÂÂ genes. Materials/Methods: 30 patients with mild to severe family history were subjected to BRCA HC Plus panel and 12 to the TruSight cancer panel (TC). Three runs were conducted using MiSeq 600V3 reagent kit in the former case, i.e.10 samples per run, while 4 samples each time were loaded on a MiSeq 300V2 kit, regarding the latter panel. Results: Both panels require a low input of DNA and have an efficient work flow. Regarding hands on time, it seems that BRCA HC MASTR Plus work flow is shorter and it may be easier for a less experienced user. Considering the quality of the final results, a high Q score was achieved with both panels. However, the average coverage (read depth) reached with the former panel was higher i.e. about 500x for most of the targeted genes compared to the one reached with the TC, regarding the common cancer genes. Conclusion: TC panel could be a solution for cases with a rather inconclusive family history, but for patients with a distinct phenotype BRCA HC MASTR plus panel offers a rather more robust and efficient method for confirming diagnosis.",2016
25926,"Introduction: In Lebanon, breast cancer is considered the most common malignancy among women. Up to 10% of breast cancers are directly related to germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. In this retrospective study, we aimed at reporting the prevalence of BRCA mutations in a Lebanese co hort of individuals with personal or strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer, in order to determine the role of BRCA testing in breast cancer risk assessment. Materials and Methods: Genetic results of all Lebanese patients, who un derwent full sequencing of BRCA1/2 at AUBMC between 2011 and 2015, were reviewed. Demographic and personal/family cancer history data were collected. Results: Deleterious mutations were identified in 10.6% of the families (20/188) (16BRCA1, 4BRCA2). In total, twelve deleterious mutations were recognized, four of them were novel. In 30% (6/20) of the carrier fami lies, the BRCA1 C44F mutation was identified; this is reportedly the most common mutation in our population, suggesting a possible founder effect. Two other mutations BRCA2 IVS24 1G>A and BRCA1 E720X accounted for respectively 15% and 10% of the familial mutations. Twenty five variants were considered of unknown clinical significance (10 BRCA1, 15 BRCA2). Conclusions: Prevalence of BRCA mutations was found to be high among tested women. Three mutations accounted for more than 55% of the total detected mutations. This study stresses on the importance of BRCA testing in Lebanese women at high risk for breast/ovarian cancer. It also highlights interesting data in terms of prevalence and spectrum of BRCA mutations in our population. Funding source: MPP/AUB",2016
25927," INTRODUCTION: In the last two decades, the molecular diagnosis of here ditary breast and/or ovarian cancer has been based on the identification of germline inactivating mutations within the BRCA genes. Unfortunately, va riants of uncertain significance (VUS) still occur in 5 10 % of tests. The aim of this study was to reassess the pathogenicity of VUS identified in families counseled at our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: VUS were reclassified into class I, II, III, IV and V following the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) recommen dations. This was done by means of a thorough review of online database resources such as BIC (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/), LOVD (http://www.lovd.nl/3.0/home) and KConFab (http://www.kconfab.org/Progress/Mutations.aspx) together with a systematic literature review. The final clas sification was based on the use of integrated analyses, in vitro transcript assays and in silico tools. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2015, 1200 families were tested for BRCA1/2 germ line mutations. A total of 307 variants were identified in 253 families and 182 were unique. Our integrative approach allowed us to reclassify 96/182 variants originally categorized as VUS (class III). Eighty of them (83%) were predicted to be non pathogenic or class I, 7 (7%) were reclassified as class II, 5 (5%) as class IV and 4 (4%) as class V. The other 86 remained as class III. CONCLUSIONS: The continuous reassessment of VUS remains a challenge for clinicians and geneticists. The wealth of information provided by NGS studies, facilitated the reclassification of more than half of our original VUS, thus allowing us to improve our preventive strategy.",2016
25928,"Introduction. Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are promis ing novel therapies for ovarian cancer patients who have developed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation positive tumors. Approximately 15% and 8% of these patients have an inactivating germline or somatic BRCA mutation, respec tively. Therefore, assessing the BRCA mutation status in DNA derived from ovarian carcinomas is crucial to select patients who may benefit from these treatments. However, the detection of germline and somatic mutations in BRCA1 and BCRA2 is hampered by the poor quality of DNA derived from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) ovarian carcinomas and the com plexity of both genes.

Calculation of the technical sensitivity and reduction of the levels of sequencing background noise was achieved using molecular barcoding to recognize unique template molecules. Results. All germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were successfully detected. In addition, pathogenic somatic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were observed in five sporadic patients (10%). Conclusions. Our approach enables the rapid and reliable detection of both germline and somatic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DNA derived from FFPE ovarian carcinomas. Consequently, this method can be applied to se lect ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from treatments with PARP inhibitors and genetic counseling.",2016
25929,", Salt Lake City, UT , United States, 3Myriad Genetics GmbH, Zurich, Switzerland. Introduction: Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) across human populations. Clinical screening of germline variants has been routine for over 2 decades in countries such as the USA. However, testing is beco ming increasingly accessible on the global scale. We report the outcomes of clinical BRCA genetic testing in a cohort ascertained across 33 countries representing 6 continents. Methods: This study assessed 3,229 consecutive individuals undergoing BRCA1 and BRCA2 full sequencing and large rearrangement analysis in a DAkkS accredited laboratory in Munich, Germany from 2013 to 2015. Cli nical information was obtained from test requisition forms completed by ordering healthcare practitioners, with the majority of patients ascertained on suspicion of HBOC. Results: Over 98% of patients were female and 72% reported a personal history of cancer. The most frequent female cancer was breast (63%), follo wed by ovarian (8%). Males comprised <2% of the patients and greater than 50% of them reported a personal history of breast cancer. Overall, 12.7% of patients tested positive for a laboratory classified pathogenic variant. Patho genic variants were enriched in patients with a personal history of cancer (13.9%) versus no personal cancer history (9.5%); this is especially striking in cancers directly associated with HBOC. Pathogenic variants were detec ted in patients originating from Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America. Conclusion: BRCA clinical testing is valuable at the global level for iden tifying high risk patients who would benefit from increased surveillance and medical intervention.",2016
25930," Ovarian Cancer (OC) is the seventh most common cause of cancer related death in women. It is estimated that about 15% of OC arise in women car rying germline BRCA1/2 mutations and that 3% of sporadic serous OCs har bour somatic BRCA1/2 mutations; BRCA deficiency is predictive of response to PARP inhibition. Since July 2015, we have included for BRCA1/2 testing also women with high grade OC with no suggestive family history. Among 21 patients with apparently sporadic OC who have undertaken testing to date, complete re sults are available for 12; four of those (33%) carry a deleterious mutation (three in BRCA2, one in BRCA1). In addition, we undertook a research pro ject aimed at analysing BRCA1/2 in fresh frozen tissue of newly diagnosed OC patients. So far, 15 patients have been enrolled; BRCA1 sequence analy sis allowed to identify three mutations out of 14 tested tumors (21%), all showed LOH; moreover, one mutation was found in one out of 13 tumors sequenced for BRCA2, which failed to show LOH. All BRCA1/2 sequence mutations were subsequently found to be germline. BRCA1 MLPA analysis was performed in 11 tumors and detected 8 acquired deletions of the whole gene (three explaining LOH in mutation carriers). Out of eight tumors ana lyzed with BRCA2 MLPA, two showed deletion of the whole gene (one in a tumor also showing loss of BRCA1). Although preliminary, our results sup port a relevant frequency of germline BRCA1/2 mutations in OC patients, while somatic mutations appeared to be limited to monoallelic BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 loss.",2016
25931,"Introduction: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among Esto nian women, 650 new cases are diagnosed annually. Ovarian cancer (OC) is less frequent, 150 new cases per year. ~10% of cancers are associated with hereditary predisposition. Materials and Methods: Altogether 953 individuals (906 females, 47 ma les) were sent for genetic testing by oncologist or medical geneticist during 2008 2015. BC was diagnosed in 339 patients (36%) and OC in 122 (13%), 14 patients had both cancers. 478/953 were high risk family members. 182 patients (19%) were 45y or younger. 654 (69%) had family history of BC/ OC. BRCA1/2 genes were analysed either by APEX, Sanger or next generati on sequencing (NGS). 314 patients were analysed against BC/OC high and medium risk genes by NGS. Deletions/duplications in BRCA1/2 genes were excluded by MLPA analysis in 547 patients. Results: 158 patients (17%) were mutation positive. The prevalence of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in BC/OC group (447 patients) was 18%, BRCA1 main mutations ratio was 45%. Interestingly we did not find any deletions/duplications from BRCA1/2 MLPA. In 26 cases (BRCA1/2 negative) the pa thogenic variant was found either from PPMID, BRIP1, CHEK2, MSH2, MSH6, PMS1, CDH1, ATM or NBN gene. Conclusions: Two main mutations in BRCA1 cover ~54% of all BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations in Estonia: c.4035delA (21%); c.5266dupC (33%). Therefore we recommend start screening with detection of these two re latively common BRCA1 mutations and in case of negative result continue with NGS. BRCA1/2 MLPA analysis is not informative in Estonia.",2016
25932,"Approximately 24% of familial breast cancer (BC) and/or ovarian cancer (OC) cases analyzed within the framework of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC HBOC) are caused by pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations. However, the mutation frequencies of non BRCA1/2 genes associated with familial BC and/or BC/OC are largely unknown. Therefore, panel next generation sequencing represents a comprehensive approach to simultaneously analyse numerous candidate genes regarding their involvement on BC/OC pathogenesis. Here, we present extended NGS data generated by using the GC HBOC designed TruRiskÃÂ® gene panel. In this study, a cohort of 594 index cases from high risk BC and BC/OC families, negative regarding deleterious mutations in BRCA1/2 was analyzed. Data analysis was accompanied by CNV detection using the SophiaDDM Version 3.5.0.12 p5.0.0 analysis tool (Sophia Genetics). By focusing on 13 BC and/or OC associated genes (ATM, CDH1, CHEK2, FANCM MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, TP53 ), we identified 25 different pathoge nic variants, including large rearrangements, in 25 unrelated mutation car riers (4,2%). Mutations were identified in ATM (n,3), CHEK2 (n,10) , FAN CM (n,4) , PALB2 (n,7) and RAD51C (n,1) . 24% of these mutations are large rearrangements, found in ATM, CHEK2 and FANCM. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of comprehensive gene panel testing along with CNV detection to be included in BC and/or OC routine diagnostics.

25933,"Introduction: Individuals at an increased familial BC risk should be identi fied, as they and their relatives can receive earlier and more intensive BC surveillance. An online self test for familial BC can identify women at in creased familial risk and may decrease anxiety and distress even in patients at low risk. Methods: Women invited for population based screening mammography were also invited for an online self test and questionnaires. Psychological impact was assessed at baseline (T0), immediately post test (T1), after two weeks (T2) using the State trait inventory Dutch Version (STAI DY) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: In total, 304 completed T0 and T1, 195 completed T2. At T1, a mo derate or high familial BC risk was identified in four (1%) and 18 (6%) wo men. There was a significant reduction in state anxiety at T1 and T2 (T1 T0: mean change , 1.69 (95%CI: 2.21, 1.17), P<0.001; T2 T0: mean change , 2.69 (95%CI: 3.93, 1.45), P<0.001). Similarly, trait anxiety but not distress were reduced at T2 (mean change , 1.31 (95%CI: 2.14, 0.48), P,0.002; mean change , 0.18 (95%CI: 0.78,0.43), P,0.57). Women at moderate or high familial BC risk had slightly higher levels of anxiety and distress at T0, T1 and T2, and similar decreases in psychological outcomes between T1 T0 and T2 T0.

25934,Mutations in a small number of genes have been associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The frequency of founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can inform genetic testing strategies for some populati ons. The main purpose of the study was to search for new pathogenic muta tions that are associated with high risk of breast and/or ovarian cancers in the Ukraine population. The study group consisted of 132 women from West Ukraine diagnosed with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer. All cases had a positive family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. DNA samples were isolated from blood. Studies were performed using Hi Plex technology incorporating mas sively parallel sequencing (next generation sequencing).In the group of patients we detected 25 (19%) pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 (5 recurrent and 3 singular mutations) and 9 (7%) pathogenic mu tations in BRCA2. The study identified a large number of variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 that have uncertain or conflicting significance to breast and ova rian cancer risk. This was the first study of women at high risk of breast and/or ovarian can cer from the West Ukraine population using next generation sequencing and established that there is a high frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in this population. The results will contribute to improved genetic testing in the Ukrainian population that currently relies on the testing of a limi ted selection of specific mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in clinical genetics practice. Improved genetic risk assessment could also lead to improved can cer prevention in this population.,2016
25935,"Breast cancer (BC) at young age is associated with poor prognosis, therefore there is a great need to characterize better this group of patients. Material/methods: 334 women with BC at/under the age of 35 were of fered genetic counseling and testing. The analysis was performed on DNA from the peripheral blood. The mutations in BRCA1,2 were detected using DHPLC and sequencing of exons in which the Polish founder mutations are found most frequently. TP53 gene was sequenced from exon 2 to 10. All the samples were screened for the Slavic c.657 661del5 mutation in NBN gene and for the most common mutations in CHEK2. Results: In this group of 334 patients we identified 67(20%)BRCA1,2 muta tion carriers and 3 TP53(0,9%), 3 NBN (0,9%),3 CHEK2(0,9%) carriers. Ma jority of the BRCA1 mutations were founder Polish mutations. Most of the BRCA1 carriers had 1st and/or 2nd degree relatives with breast and/or ova rian cancer. There was no such correlation in the group of BRCA2 and TP53 mutation carriers, however all TP53 carriers had BC with high expression of estrogene and progesterone receptor and overexpression of Her2 (Ã¢ÂÂtriple positive BCÃ¢ÂÂ. Conclusion:In Polish women diagnosed with BC at very young age genetic testing for the BRCA1,2 mutations should be offered, even in the absence of relevant family history. Screening for the founder Polish BRCA1 mutations is not sufficient in this group. In the youngest women diagnosed with Ã¢ÂÂtriple positiveÃ¢ÂÂ BC sequencing of TP53 gene should be considered.

25936,"Hereditary breast cancer (HBC) accounts for 5% of BC cases. Germline BRCA1/2 mutations explain 60% of HBC, but no other major genes have been identified in the remaining 40%.We decided to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) in affected I degree cousin pairs displaying features suggestive of HBC, who tested negative for BRCA1/2. Based on their relationship, I degree cousins share 1/8 of the entire genome, which helps filter and select candidate variants. To date, 4 cousin pairs were analyzed through WES and candidate variants were iden tified in three different genes in 3 pairs, whereas the fourth one shared a BRCA2 deletion not previously identified by Sanger sequencing. The candidate variants, affecting ROS1, RASAL1 and ICAM5 genes, were confirmed by direct sequencing. Further characterization of the variants is ongoing. In particular, the ROS1 variant affected a predicted canonic splice site, suggesting an effect on the correct splicing of ROS1, a tyrosine kinase receptor that has been implicated in several cancer types. We inserted the wild type or mutant genomic region into a minigene plasmid, transfected it into COS7 cells, and found that the mutant cells used a cryptic intronic splice site 20 bp downstream, leading to the insertion of a premature stop codon in the protein. Future studies will explore the effect of the variant on cell growth/proliferation and invasion in CRISP/Cre modified MCF10A and MCF7 cells. Our findings support previous evidence that many different genes account for the fraction of HBC not related to BRCA1/2 mutations and led us to iden tify promising novel variants for HBC.",2016

So, early detection and targeted therapies of cancer can sig nificantly reduce the mortality as well as increase the survival rate. MicroR NAs are a well known candidate to develop predictive and prognostic bio molecules that can be affordably used as early and non invasive detection marker. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of miR 21 and miR 155 in Iranian Breast cancer patients and the potential use of circulating miRs as non invasive biomarker. Material and methods: Tumor specimens, paired non tumoral adjacent tis sues and matching plasma samples from 30 Iranian women breast cancer were collected. Plasma of normal women were also used as control. The rela tive expression of miR 21 and miR 155 was measured by real time quantita tive reverse transcription PCR. Results: The levels of miR 21 and miR 155 were significantly higher in plas ma (p, 0.02 and 0.01, respectively) and tissue sample (p, 0.00 and 0.00, respectively) of breast cancer patients in comparison with control groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed 0.81 and 0.83 in miR 21 and miR 155 tissue, as well as 0.99 and 0.92 in miR 21 and miR 155 plasma samples respectively. Moreover, there was no relation between the expression level of miRs and clinic pathologic data. Conclusion: These finding revealed that the expression patterns of these cir culating miRs in Iranian women are the same as their paired tissue groups and also other population over the world.

Using this strategy, we have now analyzed 4175 patients and detected 722 (17 %) deleterious mutations. The majority of the mutations (83%) were found in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, ATM, TP53, RAD51C, BRIP1, RINT1 with respective incidences of 4,6%, 4%, 1.2%, 1.1%, 1%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%. BRCA1 and BRCA2 exhibited 359 mutations including 26 large rearrange ments. The 46 mutations detected in PALB2 were mostly found in women with a cancer over 40 years and the 21 RAD51C mutations preferentially in women with ovarian cancer. TP53 was mutated in 23/3865 index cases including only 4 characteristic Li Fraumeni families and preferentially in women with breast cancer before 31 years.

25941,"Introduction: Breast cancer prognosis is affected by tumour characteristics and adjuvant treatment. It has been suggested that prognosis in familial breast cancer could be influenced by parent of origin with a worse progno sis when breast cancer is inherited paternally. The aim of this study was to investigate parent of origin effects on prognosis in our cohort of non BRCA hereditary breast cancer families in Stockholm, Sweden. Material and methods: Pedigrees from 1782 families were eligible. Index patients were divided into two study groups, paternal and maternal inheri tance. Tumour characteristics and survival data for the index patients were collected and analysed. Results: In total 319 families fulfilled inclusion criteria, 229 and 90 index patients in maternal and paternal group respectively. Affected mothers were excluded to avoid bias. Median follow up was 11 years. No significant differ ence in overall survival or recurrence free survival between maternal and paternal inheritance of breast cancer was observed with hazard ratios 0.99 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.80) and 1.22 (95% CI: 0.78 to 1.92) respectively. Conclusion: We found no evidence for a worse prognosis with paternally inherited breast cancer compared to maternal inheritance. However, with this sample size only large differences in prognosis can be detected. In that perspective the tendency towards worse recurrence free survival (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 0.78 to 1.92) in the group with paternal inheritance is interesting. Also notable is the skew distribution with a predominance of maternally in herited cases indicating that accuracy of self reported family history is low for paternally inherited breast cancer.",2016

We have previously detected these variants among BC patients during the panel based NGS screening of 94 cancer genes. Based on ClinVar and/or type of the mutation, five variants were pathogenic, while seven were variants of unknown significance (VUS).

25945,"Introduction: Cancer as disease is characterized by extreme genetic hete rogeneity. Also when it comes to specific cancer types the heterogeneity is still present not only on interindividual basis but also on intratumoral level. The genomic analysis of dual tumors originated from the same patient could bring new information in the field of detection of disease progression and tumor evolution. Materials and Methods: Dual breast cancer tumors of 4 patients were ana lyzed with ultradeep genomic sequencing. For genomic sequencing TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel and Miseq system were used. Gained genomic data were analyzed using BaseSpace standard analysis tool for TruSeq applica tions. After variant calling variants with frequency between 10% and 90% were compared between the two samples originated from single patient. Tumor specific variants were subsequently characterized in details. Results: After variant calling from 147 to 172 variants were identified. From these 13 to 22 variants were present in 10 to 90% variant frequency and except by both tumor samples shared variants in all tumor pairs at least one single tumor specific variant associated with oncogenic effect was recorded. These were represented by variants in ERBB2 (p. V777L and p. L869R), TP53 (p. P152fs*14 and p. Y205S) and PIK3CA (p. Q546E and p. H1047R) genes. Conclusions: Identified shared as well as single tumor specific variants with confirmed oncogenic effect could be used in personalized disease progressi on molecular testing. Moreover, with addition of future prospectively gained biological samples and clinical information important knowledge about tu mor evolution could be added.

25946,"Introduction: According to recent data from ongoing basket trials, about 1 in 5 patients presents with poor biopsies with small sample size, and/or low tumor content due to admixture of normal cells, preventing them ac cess to precision oncology. Here we describe a workflow for whole exome sequencing (WES) of pure populations of tumor cells obtained from very low tumor cellularity FFPE samples using DEPArrayÃ¢ÂÂ¢ sorting technology. Materials and Methods: A FFPE 50ÃÂµm thick section from breast infiltra ting ductal carcinoma, with 10% tumor cellularity, was dissociated into a cell suspension. Using DEPArrayÃ¢ÂÂ¢ digital sorter, 419 cells from 100% pure tumor and 497 cells from normal stromal subpopulations were recovered based on Keratin/Vimentin immunofluorescence and DNA content.

25947,"Introduction: JAK2 and MPL mutations are being used for diagnosis of Es sential Trombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), but 30 40% of the patients do not carry any mutations of these genes. Recently, another gene called Calreticulin (CALR) has been reported to be involved in development of ET and PMF. In this study, we investigated the CALR mutati on frequency, mutation types and their relevance to clinical findings. Materials and methods: 16 ET and 4 PMF patients were enrolled in this stu dy. All patients were negative for JAK2 V617F, MPL W515K/L and S505N mutations. We investigated CALR mutation status with Sanger sequencing method. Results: The mutation rate was 25% in general. However, we did not find any mutations in patients with PMF. We detected three different mutations (31.25%) in 5 patients with ET . Three of the mutations were 52 base pairs (bp) deletion (Type I mutation, c.1092_1143del), one was 5 bp insertion (Type II mutation, c.1154_1155insTTGTC) and the last one was 46 bp dele tion (c.1094_1139del). All patients with Type I mutation were women and the mean age (23.3y) was found to be significantly lower compared to all groups (p,0.003).Conclusions: The results showed that the mutation rate and types were si milar to the previous reports. New prospective studies with larger cohort will help us to understand the effect of CALR mutations in the development and prognosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms.

25948,"Introduction: Approximately 10% of all types of cancer are hereditary disor ders due to germline mutations, which can be transmitted to the offspring. The aim of the present study is to detect germline cancer associated altera tions, which increase the cancer risk among carriers, using next generation sequencing. Materials and methods: We have analyzed 17 blood DNA samples from indi viduals with family history: 6 patients (4 with breast cancer, 1 with ovarian and 1 with colorectal cancer) and 11 unaffected persons (10 with breast cancer relatives and 1 with colorectal cancer relatives). The analysis was performed using the TruSight Cancer Panel, which includes 94 genes and 284 SNPs associated with predisposition to cancer. Results: We have detected the following alterations: (i) the colorectal can cer patient and the unaffected person with family history both carry pro bably pathological mutations in the APC gene, namely p. Glu1573LysfsTer3 and p. Ala1283Pro; (ii) the ovarian cancer patient carries the pathological p. Val1663LeufsTer6 mutation in the BRCA2 gene; (iii) three out of four bre ast cancer patients have pathological mutations in the following genes: TP53 (193H>LH), BRCA2 (p. Ala938ProfsTer21) and BRCA1 (p. Gly1232Glyfs). Among the 10 unaffected persons with breast cancer family history five are carriers of pathological mutations in BRCA2: p. Thr3033AsnfsTer11 or p. Lys1590SerfsTer27.Conclusion: In cases with cancer family history, the possibility to detect the pathological mutations running in the pedigree is very high among patients (5 out of 6) and healthy relatives (6 out of 11) and can be determined by using the TruSight Cancer Panel.",2016
25949,"Sanger sequencing by capillary electrophoresis (CE) offers many advantages over NGS screening, including simplified workflow, faster time to answer, less expense, and easier data analysis. Coupled with Applied BiosystemsÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Minor Variant Finder (MVF) software to detect low abundance alleles, these features make front line screening of solid tumors for oncogenic mutations by CE an attractive possibility. We have designed a panel for CE sequencing consisting of 26 amplicons covering 66 COSMIC somatic mutations that are most commonly found in tumor DNA samples. A total 1972 COSMIC sites are covered by the panel. We screened 44 solid tumor FFPE samples from various tissues for these alleles. We found 34 samples with known hot spot mutations. Allele frequencies determined by CE sequencing and MVF at these sites were highly correlative with Ion TorrentÃ¢ÂÂ¢ NGS determined frequencies. Pathogenic alleles were detected down to frequencies of 5%. Furthermore, minor variants were detectable in as little as 100pg of input DNA. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by screening tissues with unknown mutation profiles with the panel and identified and quantified hotspot mutations in known tumorigenic genes. Therefore, CE sequencing followed by MVF analysis provides a fast and simple first line screen for pa thogenic alleles in FFPE tumor samples.",2016
25950,"Background: microRNAs are associated with regulation of distinct physio pathological processes including development of normal stem cells and carcinogenesis. In this study we aimed to investigate microRNA profile of Cancer stem like cells isolated form freshly resected larynx cancer (LCa) tissue samples. Materials and Methods: CD133 high stem like cells were isolated from freshly resected LCa tumor specimens. MicroRNA profile of 12 pair of CD133 high and CD133 low cells was determined using microRNA microar ray and differential expressions of selected microRNAs were validated by quantitative real time PCR (qRT PCR).Results: MicroRNA profiling of CD133 high and CD133 low LCa samples re vealed that miR 26b, miR 203, miR 200c, and miR 363 3p were significant ly downregulated and miR 1825 was upregulated in CD133high larynx CSLCs. qRT PCR analysis in a total of 25 CD133 high/ CD133 low paired samples were confirmed the altered expressions of these five microRNAs. Expressions of miR 26b, miR 200c, and miR 203 were significantly corre lated with miR 363 3p, miR 203, and miR 363 3p expressions, respectively. Furthermore, in silico analysis revealed that these microRNAs target both cancer and stem cell associated signaling pathways. Conclusions: Our results showed that certain microRNAs in CD133 high cells could be used as cancer stem cell markers. Based on these results, we propose that this panel of microRNAs might carry crucial roles in LCa patho genesis through regulating stem cell properties of tumor cells.

25951,"Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumors of bone. They are considered as resistant to both chemotherapy and radiations. This emergent study aims to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance of chon drosarcomas to cisplatin or to X ray treatments by an innovative strategy of comparative functional genomics. We observed, using five cell lines derived from human chondrosarcomas, that they had distinct responses to cisplatin or to X ray treatments. To un derstand the molecular basis of these different sensitivities, we performed whole exome sequencing on the cell lines. After strict filtration, 245 to 476 rare coding or splice variants per cell line were predicted to have a delete rious functional impact on the protein. We applied targeted, then pangeno mic approaches to select relevant variants. We identified 66 mutated genes potentially implicated in the response to therapy. Interestingly, recurrent loss of function mutations of a tumor suppressor gene were identified in the three most resistant cell lines in which no apoptosis is induced by X rays nor cisplatin. This gene is actionable by targeted chemotherapy. Functional analyses are in progress to validate the role of this very promising gene mu tations and of the 65 other genes in resistance to treatments. In conclusion, chondrosarcoma cell lines respond differently to conventional therapies. In addition, our study is the first one which extensively characte rized commonly used human chondrosarcoma cell lines by whole exome sequencing. Our preliminary results provide essential genetic information on resistance mechanisms through the identification of genes potentially involved in the response to cisplatin and X ray radiations.",2016
25952,"Background: Temsirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapa mycin (mTOR), is an effective anti cancer drug. There are large variations in response among patients, in part explained by mutations activating mTOR pathway. Here, we present a metastatic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma patient with complete response at metastatic sites and 80% size reduction of the renal tumor after temsirolimus treatment. After nephrectomy and 5 years after temsirolimus the patient developed a retroperitoneal adenopa thy that was resected. Currently, >7 years after temsirolimus, the patient is disease free. Patients and Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed on the primary tumor, the retroperitoneal adenopathy and normal blood. Soma tic single nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions leading to non synomymous coding or splice site variants were identified. Immunohi stochemical detection of TSC2 and phospho ribosomal protein (pS6) was performed. Results: Whole exome sequencing revealed two concurrent inactivating mutations in tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), a critical negative regulator of mTOR Complex 1. One was a splicing defect (c.5069 1G>C) in intron 39 of TSC2, and the other consisted on two nucleotide substitutions in exon 28 (c. 3200_3201delinsAA; p. V1067E). These mutations abolished TSC2 acti vity and increased mTOR pathway activation, as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of S6, suggesting they constituted the basis for the excep tional temsirolimus response. Conclusions: Whole exome sequencing in patients with extraordinary drug responses have the potential to uncover mechanisms that underlie drug sensitivity. Specifically, sequencing of mTOR pathway in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma may serve to prioritize mTOR inhibitor treatment and guide therapy in these patients.

25953,"Introduction: Chromosomal translocations are rare in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). With the exception of t(3q), translocations are not explicitly considered in the cyto genetic classification of the IPSS R and their impact on disease progression and patient survival is unknown. The present study was aimed at determi ning the prognostic impact of translocations in the context of the cytogene tic classification of the IPSS R. Material and Methods: We evaluated 1,653 patients from the Spanish Regi stry of MDS diagnosed with MDS or CMML and an abnormal karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis. Results: Translocations were identified in 168 patients (T group). Compared with the 1,485 patients with abnormal karyotype without translocations (non T group), the T group had a larger proportion of patients with refrac tory anemia with excess of blasts and higher scores in both the cytogenetic and global IPSS R. Translocations were associated with a significantly shor ter survival and higher incidence of transformation into AML at univariate analysis but both features disappeared after multivariate adjustment for the IPSS R cytogenetic category. Patients with single or double translocations other than t(3q) had an outcome similar to those in the non T group in the intermediate cytogenetic risk category of the IPSS R. Conclusion: The presence of translocations identifies a subgroup of MDS/CMML patients with a more aggressive clinical presentation that can be ex plained by a higher incidence of complex karyotypes. Single or double trans locations other than t(3q) should be explicitly considered into the interme diate risk category of cytogenetic IPSS R classification.",2016
25954,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a cancer of B lymphocytes, which expands in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen and blood. Many genes have been implicated in CLL development through sequencing the tumor genome. However, these studies do not completely explain the pathogene sis of the disease, nor do they define the early events that lead the B cells to accumulate the different types of somatic mutations leading to CLL. The aim of this project is to identify the landscape of germline risk factors that can predispose an individual to CLL. In particular, we have designed a rare variant association study based on the hypothesis that rare mutations are more likely to affect the function of the proteins and may modulate risk for complex diseases. We have analyzed exome sequencing data on 450 CLL ca ses (normal and tumor samples) respectively, from the Spanish CLL ICGC consortium and performed rare variant association study with 950 controls from our in house exomes. We identified genes that were enriched in our CLL cohort than in controls. We designed a targeted sequencing panel con sisting of 358 genes, 945 cancer susceptible SNPs and 166 microRNAs. Se quencing was performed in a cohort of 95 CLL, 95 prostate cancer and 290 healthy control samples. The most relevant genes we have identified that are associated with susceptibility to CLL are ERCC4, MET and NCAPG2. The results imply an important possible component of CLL pathogenesis and merit further functional studies for confirmation.

25955,"Introduction: In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), somatic defects of TP53 gene represent an adverse prognostic marker. In the majority of af fected cases, TP53 is inactivated on both alleles due to the concurrent mu tation and deletion. However, in ~30% of cases, only single TP53 mutation (TP53mut) without deletion is detected. We aimed to perform a detailed analysis of the second TP53 allele in these cases and to assess their genomic makeup. Materials and methods: Separated CLL lymphocytes were investigated. TP53 mutations were analyzed using FASAY assay and direct sequencing. 17p13 deletions were assessed by iFISH. Genome wide analysis was perfor med on CytoScanHD arrays (Affymetrix). Results: We identified 179 CLL cases with TP53 disruption; 56/179 patients (31%) harbored single TP53mut with allelic frequency ranging 10 100%. We selected 22 cases with single TP53mut for CytoScan analysis. Interestin gly, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (cn LOH) in a subclone of CLL lym phocytes was detected in 11/22 cases. In 9/22 cases no abnormality in 17p locus was observed. In the remaining 2/22 cases, heterozygous deletion was newly detected. When we compared genomic complexity of leukemic clo nes with monoallelic vs biallelic (cn LOH only) TP53mut, the latter group exhibited significantly more genomic abnormalities (4 vs 6 chromosomal defects, p,0.0121). However, there was no difference in overall survival bet ween the groups. Conclusion: cn LOH in 17p locus is a frequent finding in cases with single TP53mut leading to biallelic TP53 inactivation and should be considered in TP53 testing in CLL.

25956,"Introduction: Recently, a new hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome has been discovered, resulting in an increased risk for spinal and intracra nial clear cell meningiomas (CCMs) in young patients. Heterozygous loss of function germline mutations in the SMARCE1 gene are causative, giving rise to an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Case report: We report on an extended family with a pediatric CCM pati ent and an adult CCM patient and several asymptomatic relatives carrying a germline SMARCE1 mutation. Discussion: We discuss difficulties in genetic counseling for this heritable condition. Because of the few reported cases so far, the lifetime risk of de veloping meningiomas for SMARCE1 mutation carriers is unclear and the complete tumor spectrum is unknown. There is no surveillance guideline for asymptomatic carriers nor a long term follow up recommendation for SMARCE1 related CCM patients as yet. Until more information is available about the penetrance and tumor spectrum of the condition, we propose the following screening advice for asymptomatic SMARCE1 mutation carriers: neurological examination and MRI of the brain and spine, yearly from dia gnosis until the age of 18 and once every 3 years thereafter, or in between if there are clinical symptoms. This advice can also be used for long term patient follow up. More data is needed to optimize this proposed screening advice. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

25958,"Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most common cancer worldwide. On the other hand, copy number variants (CNV) are structural variations larger than 1 kilobase (kb) displaying copy number differences either polymorphic or related with predisposition to disease. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in germline DNA from 38 families with strong CRC aggregation without altera tions in known hereditary genes. To identify rare CNV that could correspond to the mutational event for CRC predisposition, WES data was analyzed with ExomeDepth and CoNIFER tools. Variants shared by family members were prioritized and compared with the Database of Genomic Variants catalogue and our Spanish database. Variants were selected and validation and as well as segregation analysis were performed by comparative genomic hybridiza tion (CGH). Gene expression analysis (arrays and qRT PCR) were conducted in both germline and tumor cDNA and tumor immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also performed. Results: Sixteen candidate CNV were detected in 15 families. The most inte resting CNV corresponded to a duplication in chromosome 1 spanning 400 kb that was confirmed by CGH and family segregation was correct. TTF2, TRIM45, VTCN1 and miR942 were affected by the duplication. Gene expres sion data indicated TTF2 and miR942 overexpression in duplication carri ers. Tumor IHC showed TTF2 protein overexpression and underexpression of the TMEM158 protein, a predicted target of miR942.Conclusions: The duplication in chromosome 1 could correspond to the mu tational event involved in the predisposition to CRC in the carrier family by overexpressing TTF2 and miR942, which would lead to TMEM158 under expression.",2016
25959,"Introduction:Aberrant DNA methylation has been widely investigated in sporadic colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) but less information is available about the role of epigenetics in hereditary CRC. Patients and Material:LINE 1 hypomethylation and gene specific hyperme thylation of 38 promoters were analyzed in multicenter series of 220 CRCs including 71 microsatellite unstable Lynch CRCs (LS MSI), 23 CRCs of young patients without inherited syndromes (EO MSS), and 126 sporadic CRCs, comprising 28 MSI unstable (S MSI) and 98 microsatellite stable cases (S MSS). All tumor methylation patterns were integrated with clinico patho logical and genetic characteristics, namely chromosomal instability (CIN), TP53 loss, BRAF, and KRAS mutations. Results:LS MSI mainly displayed absence of extensive DNA hypo and hy permethylation. A subset of LINE 1 hypomethylated LS MSI showed G>A transition in the KRAS gene, absence of CIN and TP53 loss and an unfavo urable prognosis. S MSI exhibited extensive gene hypermethylation, MLH1 methylation, BRAF mutation and absence of CIN and TP53 loss. By contrast, S MSS showed marked LINE 1 hypomethylation and CIN and they had a worse prognosis. EO MSS were a genetically and epigenetically heteroge neous group. Like LS MSI, some EO MSS displayed low rates of DNA hypo or hypermethylation and frequent KRAS G>A transitions. By contrast, some EO MSS showed similar features to those observed in S MSS, such as LINE 1 hypomethylation, CIN and TP53 deletion. In all four classes, hypermethyla tion of ESR1, GATA5, and WT1 was very common. Conclusion:Aberrant DNA methylation analysis allows the identification of different subsets of CRCs. This study suggests that LINE 1 hypomethylation may be a useful prognostic marker in both sporadic and inherited CRCs.",2016

The aim of the work was to determing different prognostic subgroups keeping in mind cancer with peritoneal carcinomato sis (PC) to be the worst prognosis group. Methods. We analyzed samples obtained from 41 patients with PC and 58 CRC stage I III including 7 patients with Lynch syndrome (LS). 12 gene expression signature has been carried out for all tumors by RT PCR. RAS/BRAF mutations and MSI were analyzed by sequencing and fragment analy sis. Hierarchical clustering has been used for data analysis. Results. Cluster analysis identified 4 groups of samples. Genes SFRP2, TNC, ZEB1, MUC2, VIM were the most significant for clustering. Seven cases have been included in Cluster 1 (MUC2/TFF3 presence, SFRP2/ZEB1 absence); 36 cases Cluster 2 (TNC presence, MUC2/TFF3 absence); 24 Cluster 3 (SFRP2/TNC/VIM presence, MUC2/TFF3 absence); 32 Cluster 4 (SFRP2/MUC2/TFF3 absence).

25961," Introduction: Germline mutations in genes from the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA damage repair pathway are known to cause FA and breast and ovarian cancer predisposition. Very recently, mutations in BRCA2, FAN1 and BLM genes have been postulated to cause familial colorectal cancer (CRC).Material and methods: Seventy four patients from 40 families with strong CRC aggregation without alterations in the known hereditary genes were selected from four Spanish hospitals and the EPICOLON consortium. Whole exome sequencing was performed and variant filtering selected only very rare alterations, shared by individuals from the same family, with a putative loss of function and located in genes with a role compatible with cancer. Results: We detected enrichment for variants in the FA DNA damage re pair pathway genes in our cohort since six families carried heterozygous, rare (<0.01%), potentially pathogenic variants located in BRCA2/FANCD1, BRIP1/FANCJ, FANCC, FANCE and REV3L/POLZ. Three of the variants corre sponded to frameshift alterations and three to missense variants predicted to be deleterious. Somatic studies also revealed loss of heterozygosity for four of the variants. Interestingly, extracolonic neoplasms including gastric, breast, uterine, and prostate were present in five families. Conclusions: Although further studies are needed to confirm its contribu tion, the FA DNA damage repair pathway could play an important role in the inherited predisposition to CRC. It is important to highlight also that pleiotropy is becoming important in germline predisposition to cancer sin ce a higher number genes may be involved in the genetic predisposition to a broader spectrum of neoplasms.",2016
25962,"Introduction: RAS testing in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is being investigated as a new method for detection and monitoring of actionable mutations. Material and Methods: 38 mCRC patients with known RAS status in tissue sample were analysed. Plasma mutations were determined with Sysmex Inostics BEAMing34 RAS mutation panel and compared to standard of care (SOC) RAS testing in tissue samples. Results: Plasma and tissue results showed a concordance of 89.5% (table). In 2 patients in which a RAS mutation was identified in plasma but not in tissue, one was treated with anti EGFR therapy and did not respond; in the other, the mutation was also detected in tissue by BEAMing re examination. In one of two cases in which a RAS mutation was detected in tissue but not in plasma, BEAMing determination in tissue confirmed the same mutation detected by SOC. Longitudinal analysis of RAS mutations in serial plasma samples from 5 pa tients that progressed to anti EGFR, showed emergence of RAS mutations in 2 patients (40%).Conclusions: The high overall concordance between tissue and plasma BE AMing determination supports the blood based testing to determinate the eligibility of CRC patients for anti EGFR treatment. The detection of RAS mutations in plasma at progression to anti EGFR suggests that BEAMing 34 RAS mutation panel may be used to monitor resistance.

In this prospective study, we compared PTEN expression levels in colorectal tumor tissues with adjacent non tumor tissues to assess the diagnostic value of this biomarker in co lorectal cancer and its relationship with the clinicopathological features of patients. Methods: Total RNA was extracted from 48 pairs of colorectal tumor tissue and adjacent non tumor tissue. Afterwards cDNAs were synthesized and the expression level of PTEN was quantified by real time PCR. The Correlation between the expression level of PTEN and clinicopathological features was studied and the capability of PTEN to function as a CRC tumor marker was also explored. Results: The expression levels of PTEN (P<0.001) were significantly de creased in colorectal tumors compared to adjacent non tumor tissues. The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on PTEN showed that the area under the ROC curve was high (0.83). No correlation was ob served between PTEN expression levels and clinicopathological features of patients. Conclusion: Our results suggest that PTEN can serve as an important pro gnostic indicator in colorectal cancer and may provide valuable information to diagnosis and targeted therapy purposes.",2016
25964,"Introduction: TRAIL (TNF related apoptosis inducing factor) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily which has been considered as a pro mising drug target for cancer therapy due to its ability to selectively induce apoptotic death in transformed cells. Inhibitors of TRAIL induced apoptosis include c FLIP , XIAP , Mcl 1, Bcl 2, Bcl xL genes. Methods: 106 colorectal tumours (63 males, 43 females, median age 70 years) along with 20 normal tissues were analysed using RT PCR, for relati ve mRNA expression analysis with ÃÂÃÂCt method for total c FLIP , XIAP , Mcl 1, Bcl 2, Bcl xL. Statistical analysis was performed in order to correlate relative mRNA levels with clinicopathological characteristics and with previous data on relative mRNA expression of TRAIL, DR4, DR5, DcR1, and DcR2 genes. Results: Elevated mRNA levels were observed as follows: Bcl 2 16%,Mcl 1 8.7%, XIAP 4.9% and total c FLIP 2.2%. Additionally, reduced mRNA levels were observed for: total c FLIP 88%, Bcl 2 84%, Bcl xL 80%, XIAP 38.7% and Mcl 1 96%. XIAP reduced mRNA levels were correlated with older pati ents (over 70 years old) and with smaller tumour size, T1/2. Finally, TRAIL ligand mRNA levels were correlated with stage and DcR1 elevated mRNA levels with patientsÃ¢ÂÂ age. Conclusions: Apart from decoy receptorsÃ¢ÂÂ over expression, a small subset of cases showed elevated mRNA levels of apoptosis resistance genes. Our re sults depict a potential significant role of XIAP expression in limiting tumour growth during colon tumorigenesis. TRAIL expression emerged as an early event, possibly delaying disease progression.",2016
25965,"Background: According to current predictions of global demographic chan ges, the WHO estimates a 77% increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and 80% increase in CRC related deaths by 2030 (Bray et al., 2012). Iden tifying genetic variants that influence susceptibility to disease potentially can inform the development of approaches for primary and secondary pre vention. Two groups have published field synopses on genetic variants as sociated with CRC, in JNCI in 2012 and Gut in 2013. These groups are now working together on an update. Methods: We have searched all published (and some unpublished) genetic association data including candidate gene and GWAS for CRC to the end of 2015. Furthermore, we have access to 4 GWAS datasets. We are conducting meta analyses. We have reached a consensus on the operationalization of the Venice guidelines on the credibility of genetic association, which had dif fered between the two previous field synopses. Results: More than 200 genes in about 770 SNPs were identified as putative ly associated with CRC. For 450 SNPs, there was a single study only; for 90 SNPs, two studies; and for 230 SNPs, 3 or more studies. Meta analysis will be carried out for SNPs with 3 or more studies, and credibility of association assessed according to the Venice criteria. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

Our data should help results of genetic associations studies to be placed in context and interpreted appropriately and should help direct future re search effort.",2016
25966,"Gains and losses of chromosome arms are usually detected in colorectal cancer (CRC) samples and may be linked to progression of this disease. Thus, we investigated specific genomic unbalances associated with CRC in Brazilian patients who underwent surgery without previous neoadjuvant treatment. The tumors were histologically classified as low and high grade according to Brazilian Society of Pathology. The total of 30 tissue samples from neoplastic and non neoplastic colorectal tissues was obtained from 10 patients. Paired peripheral blood samples were used as controls. The DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, Ca lifornia) and investigated by MLPA method (MRC HollandÃÂ®, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with combination of specific kits for CRC basic research (P413 and P146). The results were analyzed using the software GeneMar kerÃÂ® (SoftGenetics, LLC, State College, PA ww.softgenetics.com). The re sults revealed alterations of several different regions: genomic gains in the long arm of 20 chromosome including probes located in ADMR1, OPRL1, MAPRE1, TPX2, ZNF217 genes and gains in the short arm of 17 chromosome including MNT and OVCA2 gene. In addition we found losses in short arm of chromosome 8 including markers of CDCA2, NKX3, LPL genes and losses in long arm of 13 chromosome including RB1, DACH, PSPC, ZMYM2 genes. Un expectedly, we also detected similar genomic imbalances in adjacent control tissues for some patients suggesting that there is a field of chromosomal in stability surrounding the tumor. Therefore the accurate genomic characteri zation of these tissues is critical to screening the progression of this disease.",2016
25967,"Background. Most studies define complex karyotype (CK) as Ã¢ÂÂ¥3 or Ã¢ÂÂ¥5 inde pendent abnormalities. In the last few years a new definitions have arisen as structurally CK and monosomal (MCK). The mentioned CKs have been claimed to be the strongest predictor of an inferior outcome in patients with haematological neoplasms. We analysed subgroups of CKs in our patients. Methods. GTG banding, FISH and spectral karyotyping were combined to re solve karyotypes. CKs were subdivided according to the number of aberrati ons (3, 4, Ã¢ÂÂ¥5), to monosomal (M), and structurally rearranged (S).Results. 147 CKs were observed in the last 4 years. The majority of cases (77%) corresponded to AML and MDS followed by CLL patients. Frequency of different subtypes of CKs is given in Table 1. 73% of CKs had Ã¢ÂÂ¥5 aber rations. 89%of them were also structurally rearranged. 56% of CKs corre sponded to monosomal and structurally complex at the same time (CKMS). All monosomal CKs with Ã¢ÂÂ¥5 aberrations were also structurally rearranged (CKMS5). This was the main group of CKs in MDS and AML. Structurally re arranged karyotypes (CKS4 and CKS5) were significantly more frequent in CLL than in AML or MDS (P<0.05).Conclusions. In MDS a distinction between CK with 3 and 4 aberrations is already crucial for prognistification. To give comprehensive information to clinicians CKs should be analysed even more extensively.

25968,"Gap junctions are intercellular channels that are formed from members of a family of proteins, the connexins (Cxs). Gap junctions play an important role in vital functions, including the regulation of cell growth and cell differen tiation. Here, we examined the expression of Cx43, a major Cx in prostate tissue, in 27 surgical specimens obtained from prostate cancer patients who underwent a primary surgical castration prior to hormonotherapy or radio therapy treatments. The expression of Cx43 gap junctions was compared to the levels of testosterone, melatonin (MLT1), and erbB2 tyrosine kinase receptors. In addition, a panel of prostate cancer cell lines and a series of normal rat prostate tissues and rat prostate tumors induced in vivo by N Methylnitrosurea were studied. We demonstrated that the lack of Cx43 gap junctions is a common feature of human prostate cancer tissues compared to nonneoplastic prostate tissues surrounding primary tumors. Cx43 gap junctions were not observed in prostate adenocarcinomas, and they seem to be independent of testosterone, melatonin, and erbB2 receptor status. In prostate cancer cell lines and rodent prostate carcinoma tissues, down regulation of Cx43 occurs at the mRNA level, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism for the decrease of Cx43 protein in prostate cancer. In summary, this study provides evidence of decreased expression of Cx43 gap junctions in prostate cancer at various stages of progression as well as prostate cancer cell lines and raises the possibility that Cx43 may be a useful marker for detecting early oncogenesis in the prostate.",2016
25969,"Introduction: The Constitutional MisMatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome (OMIN #276300) is a rare autosomal recessive cancer predis position disease caused by inactivating biallelic germline mutations in mis match repair (MMR) genes. Carriers develop in their childhood hematologic malignancies, central nervous system tumors or colorectal tumors, as well as other neoplasia. Many patients overlap neurofibromatosis type I features such as cafe au lait spots. Patient and Methods: MMR genes were studied by amplicon based NGS on a suspected CMMRD patient belonging to a consanguineous Spanish family. Directed genetic study was extended to other family members, collecting. clinical and pathological data. Microsatellite Instability (MSI) status and in munohistochemical (IHC) studies on mismatch repair complex proteins was performed on tumor and normal tissues. Results: Two siblings carrying homozygous nonsense mutation on MSH6 gene were identified: one developed an abdominal B cell non Hodgkin lym phoma and two lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma, and the other a nephroblas toma. Both of them were diagnosed at early age and presented cafe au lait macules. IHQ on different tumors showed absence of staining for the MSH6 protein both in malignant and normal tissues. However, MSI was only ob served in tumor but not in blood or oral epithelium controls. Conclusions: Our results confirm previous clinical and molecular observa tions for CMMRD patients. Remarkably both homozygous carriers scored positive for the indication criteria for CMMRD testing suggested by the European Consortium Ã¢ÂÂCare for CMMRDÃ¢ÂÂ.

Introduction: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) are rare and mostly benign tumours. Approximately 10% of PPGL are malignant, as de fined by the presence of metastases, i.e chromaffin tissue at a location that usually does not contain chromaffin cells. However, up to 35% of tumours in patients carrying an SDHB mutation appears to be malignant. No reliable marker allows prediction of whether a PPGL is, or will become malignant. In addition, there are no curative treatments if metastases occur. Materials and methods: In order to identify genetic markers allowing to di stinguish benign from malignant tumours, 40 benign and 11 malignant PPGL were investigated for differences in mRNA expression with Affymetrix arrays. Expression data were normalized according to Affymetrix recommendati ons. Then, using Pomelo II (http://pomelo2.bioinfo.cnio.es/), a Limma t test was performed, to assess which genes were differentially expressed between benign and malignant PPGL. Clustered and non clustered analysis were per formed, and 15 genes with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) below 0.05 and a relative overexpression ratio of at least 4 were found. They were further in vestigated using qRT PCR, and immunohistochemistry on Tissue Micro Array including 88 benign and 13 malignant PPGL. Subsequently, slides of malignant and benign tumours (n, 32 respectively) were stained. Results: Contactin 4 (CNTN4) was significantly overexpressed (FDR,0.001, and p,0.004 for the IHC) in malignant compared to benign tumours. Conclusion: CNTN4 overexpression is associated with malignant PPGL, and may thus predict metastatic dissemination in patients with PPGL. Notably, CNTN1 has been shown to be associated with malignancy in different tu mours including gliomas.",2016
25971,"The majority of colorectal cancer is sporadic; however up to 10% may be inherited; with Lynch syndrome, Familial Adenomatous polyposis and MU TYH associated polyposis the most common known hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes. Other conditions, such as Cowden syndrome are rare causes of colorectal cancer and colorectal polyps; hence genetic testing is not routinely offered. Historically, genetic counselling has involved perfor ming a risk assessment based on an individualÃ¢ÂÂs family history of cancer and sequential single gene testing. With the advent of panel testing it is beco ming possible to simultaneously examine multiple genes, which is eliciting unusual phenotypes. This case report presents an individual tested through GeneHealth UK due to a personal history of colorectal polyps and a family history of colorectal cancer and polyps. No history of learning difficulties, skin lesions, other can cers/tumours was noted. The proband was counselled and offered Bowel Gene panel testing, which tests 11 genes associated with colorectal cancer and colorectal polyps using NextGeneration sequencing on an illumine plat form. A pathogenic mutation was found in the PTEN gene, which confirmed a diagnosis of Cowden syndrome, which is thought to affect 1 in 200 000 individuals in the population. This report illustrates the importance of learning more about established phenotypes, clinical diagnostic criteria and the impact of panel testing. It explores challenges in identifying patients with unexpected mutations and the importance of recommending validated cancer screening.

However, around 10 15% of all diagnosed GISTs are referred to as wild type (WT) GISTs and V600E mutation in BRAF was in <5% of cases. The aim of this study was to confirm and quantify the pres ence of BRAF mutation using sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in GISTs samples previously positive for V600E by allele specific approach and/or dideoxysequencing. Material and methods: DNA was extracted from 9 FFPE tissue section of V600E positive GISTs patients. Different amount of DNA Ã¢ÂÂ 130/100/10ng were used to prepare master mix with ddPCR Mut Assay BRAF and droplets were generated. Serial dilutions of V600E positive RKO cell line DNA in wild type DNA were used for calibration. Results: The average number of droplets was 13696/PCR. The mutation could be detected in a dilution of 0.08%. The presence of V600E mutation in the 8 tested samples (positive by allele specific PCR) was 1.9 % up to 0.34%. Sample positive for 1.9 % and 0.34% showed positivity and negativity by Sanger sequencing, respectively. One sample shows positivity below the li mit of the detection of 0.06%, however was positive by allele specific PCR. Conclusions: The BRAF mutation in GISTs occur in a very low number of cells, however, the detection of these mutations is particularly important in terms of propped treatment and targeted therapy. The method should be evaluated to higher sensitivity and used in order to improve the therapy op portunities of patients. Supported by Biomedical Center Martin ITMS 26220220187",2016

Some studies suggest that the centromere excision is under diagnosed, because centromere as a small marker chromosome can be usually detected by FISH only.

However, germline mutations are identified only in a minori ty of patients, suggesting a role for different risk factors. Among those, we considered PTEN levels, which in mouse models were associated to BC risk. We assessed PTEN expression in 31 women with early onset BC (26 35 years), who had tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutations, using q real time PCR. Expression levels were compared to the mean level of 23 healthy fema le blood donors aged 50 or older. Patients were then subdivided into three groups: 13 patients under expressing PTEN (Ã¢ÂÂ¤80%), 8 over expressing PTEN (Ã¢ÂÂ¥125%) and 10 with expression similar to controls. If compared to patients with normal or lower levels, patients overexpressing PTEN had a more recent diagnosis (7,38 vs 8,10 vs 11,15 years, respectively), larger tumors (mean diameter: 21,7 mm vs 17,6 vs 18, respectively), with a T2 stage in 50% of the group compared to 22.2% and 16.7% in normal and low expression groups, respectively. These differences, however, did not reach the statistical significance; no other differences were detected between the groups. To explore the mechanisms underlying different PTEN levels, PTEN mutations and defect of methylation were analyzed, with no alterations de tected.

According to clinical guidelines EGFR genotyping is a routine diagnostic procedure be fore prescribing tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Aside EGFR testing the detection of ALK EML4 gene rearrangements which occur in 4 10% of all adenocarci noma cases is recommended prior to initiating targeted therapy. Methods and materials: EGFR genotyping and ALK testing of the DNA de rived from the FFPE NSCLC samples were carried out. The specimens were collected from the 279 patients with NSCLC (179 women and 100 men). The median age at diagnosis was 57 years. Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 87%. DNA testing was performed using Cobas EGFR Mutation Test Kit. To confirm the results Sanger sequencing was performed. ALK screening was carried out using the VENTANA anti ALK (D5F3) assay. Results: Mutations in the EGFR gene were detected in 28,5% of all tested samples. Mutations in exon 19 were found in 41%, L858R in 35%, T790M in 12%, G719C in 5% and an insertion in exon 20 in 7%.

Although the study of family members revealed that degree of thrombocytopenia and bleeding tenden cy were mild, 4 patients had childhood B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), confirming that ETV6 RT is a ALL predisposition syndrome. In vitro studies revealed that patient megakaryocytes have defective maturation and proplatelet formation, while platelet have reduced ability to spread on fibrinogen; however clinical and laboratory findings did not identify any pe culiar defect that can be used to suspect this disorder and also platelet size (usually enlarged in ITs) was normal..

25979,"Background: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) progressing after endocrine therapy frequently activates mTOR pathway. The BOLERO 2 trial showed that everolimus exemestane achieves increased progression free survival (PFS) compared with exemestane. However, there is great inter patient vari ability in toxicity and response to exemestane everolimus treatment. The objective of this study was to explore the implication of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on outcomes from this treatment through a phar macogenetic analysis. Patients and Methods: Blood was collected from 90 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative MBC treated with exemes tane everolimus following progression after prior treatment with a non steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Everolimus pharmacokinetics was measured in 37 patients. Twelve SNPs in genes involved in everolimus pharmacokinet ics and pharmacodynamics were genotyped and associations assessed with drug plasma levels, clinically relevant toxicities (non infectious pneumoni tis, mucositis, hyperglycemia and hematological toxicities), dose reductions or treatment suspensions due to toxicity, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Results: We found that CYP3A4 rs35599367 variant (CYP3A4*22 allele) carriers had higher everolimus blood concentration compared to wild type patients (P,0.019). ABCB1 rs1045642 was associated with risk of muco sitis (P,0.031), while PIK3R1 rs10515074 and RAPTOR rs9906827 were associated with hyperglycemia and non infectious pneumonitis (P,0.016 and 0.024, respectively). Furthermore, RAPTOR rs9906827 was associated with PFS (P,0.006).Conclusions: CYP3A4*22 allele influenced plasma concentration of everoli mus and several SNPs in mTOR pathway genes were associated with treat ment toxicities and prognosis.

25982,"Introduction: Testicular cancer represents ~1 1.5% of male tumors, with a peak incidence between 15 and 45 years. Human Testicular germ cell tu mors (TGCT) have a strong genetic component, familial aggregation is ob served in ~1% of cases, although no high penetrance genes have been iden tified so far. The aim is the identification of high /moderate susceptibility genes by WES technique. Materials and Methods: Currently, 20 families with at least two affected members were selected, from them, 8 have already been sequenced using a HiSeq2000. Data was analyzed according to the specific pipeline described by our group based on different filters. Considering the recent findings in the genetic background of the TGCTs and our preliminary results, we are working on the hypothesis of a polygenic model of inheritance, making a family based association test in parallel with a population based associati on test with the FB SKAT test, to evaluate the level of additive effect that our variants could have with the familial aggregation of the disease. Results: 87 variants were identified in candidate genes, whose functions have been implicated in pathways involving male germ cell development, spermatogenesis, microtubule assembly, DNA damage response, steroid hormone signaling or telomerase function. From them, 65 were validated by Sanger sequencing and segregation analysis performed. Nine, seven and one variants are shared between 2, 3 and 4 different fami lies, respectively. Conclusion: Our preliminary results show that a number of moderate low susceptibility alleles from specific pathways could be involved in this type of familial tumors. B.

Re cently FAN1 germline mutations have been associated to MMR proficient colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer predisposition. The aim of this study was to determine whether germline FAN1 play also a role in LLS. Patients and methods: Germline analysis of FAN1 was performed in 30 LLS unrelated individuals showing MSH2 loss of expression in tumors. Pathoge nicity assessment of identified variants was performed using computational and cosegregation analyses. Results: We identified three rare missense variants in 3 unrelated LLS patients (10% of the studied sample). Two of the 3 identified variants, c.434G>A [p.(R145H)] and c.1129C>T [p.(R377W)], cosegregated with colorectal cancer affected relatives. The remaining variant, c.1856T>A (p.

Many of the available cell lines from FA anemia patients are difficult to manipulate and are not isogenic. Objectives: Due to current limitations of FA cell models, we decided to knock out (KO) genes implicated in the FA/BRCA pathway (FANCA, FANCD1, FANCQ and FAN1) in the genetically amenable human HEK293T cell line. Methods: We used TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 for gene KO. Specific gene dis ruption was proven by genetic complementation with the corresponding wildtype gene using lentiviral vectors or transient transfection. Results: We successfully generated FANCA, FANCD1, FANCQ and FAN1 KO HEK293T cells using engineered nucleases. All these cells are sensitive to DNA crosslinking agents, thus mimicking cells from patients with defects in the FA/BRCA pathway. Moreover, all FA genes KO cells get blocked in the G2/M phase upon treatment with DNA crosslinkers, a typical FA cellular phenotype.

We performed TP53 mutation screening in a cohort of 14 probands whose family cancer histories presented at least one LFS core cancer before age 45, and a second cancer of any type before age 45, irrespective of degree of kinship. These features are reminiscent of LFS, yet not compatible with LFS or Li Fraumeni like (LFL) published criteria. A pathogenic TP53 mutation was identified in 1/14 probands (7.1%), a 14 year old female diagnosed with fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC).

Ion Torrent sequencing reveals the full se quence of the gene fusion. We developed cloud based software to enable the design of a custom Ampli seq gene fusion panel, with up to 1,000 fusions and gene expression assays. We extensively mined the scientific literature and the COSMIC database for fusions. We rigorously curated this data, including correction of reported sequence to obtain genomic coordinates, breakpoints, exon junctions, and selected wet lab testing. We created a database containing over 1000 high quality fusion isoforms, including 70 ALK, 60 RET , 26 ROS1, and 21 NTRK1 fusions. We designed multiplexable Ampliseq primers for all fusions. We developed cloud based analysis software to analyze sequencing data, utilizing the rich annotation information. The reads are mapped to a custom fusion reference sequence; an optimized algorithm selects confidently map ped reads using overlap and breakpoint information, and sensitively detects gene fusions.

Objectives: To analyze the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of these four genes in paired samples of tumor normal gastric mucosa, according to the genotypes of their GC associated variants. Methods: IHC staining was performed on tissue slides of 100 pairs of FFPE tissue blocks of tumor and adjacent non tumor gastric mucosa from 100 patients with GC. Samples were grouped in three categories according to the percentage of IHC stained cells in gastric mucosa: 0 10%, >10 50% and >50 100%. The kappa statistic was used to evaluate the agreement between tumor and paired non tumor tissues. The Fisher exact test was used to ana lyze differences between the histological subtypes of gastric cancer in tu mor samples. Association between IHC expression of TFF1, MUC1 and NQO1 and TFF1 rs2839488 and rs9976977, MUC1 rs3814316 and rs4072037 and NQO1 rs7359387, was analyzed by logistic regression. Results: TFF1 was significantly decreased or absent in tumor mucosa. MUC1 and NQO1 were expressed in both normal and tumor mucosa, particularly of the intestinal type, but expression decreased in tumor samples. PTPN11 expression was absent in 95% of the samples.

Introduction: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common oncological diseases with high morbidity and mortality. Genetic factors may increase the risk of developing GC. The aims of this study are to identify new genes invol ved in the development of GC and to characterize mutations in these genes. Materials and methods: The study included GC 52 patients aged 35 59 years, who had given the tumor material, normal gastric tissue and venous blood. Search for mutations in 52 cancer related genes was carried out by high throughput parallel DNA sequencing. For the validation of the detected mutations we used Sanger sequencing. Determination of germline or soma tic nature of the identified mutations was done by DNA sequencing of nor mal tissues of the same patients. Results: Mutations were found in 22 out of 52 genes. We show that diffuse and intestinal GC types are distinguished by the spectra of somatic muta tions: somatic mutations in the CDH1 gene are more common in the dif fuse type (p,0.04) and mutations in the TP53 gene are more common in the intestinal type of GC (p,0.04). Germline mutations in patients with GC were for the first time detected in the genes MET (p. N375S, p. R970C), RB1 (p. H686N), EGFR (p. V292M), JAK3 (p. V722I), APC (p. I1289K), ATM (p.

Recently, we described MAP3K6 germline mutations in hereditary GC. So matic hypermethylation of an intragenic CpG island, overlapping a DNase ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 278Back to index hypersensitive site predicted to harbour a promoter associated regulatory element, has been presented as a putative second hit. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the relevance of MAP3K6 in sporadic GC. Materials and Methods: MAP3K6 expression was evaluated by qRT PCR in RNA from sporadic GC cases and corresponding adjacent normal mucosa. Methylation profile of MAP3K6 promoter and gene body was assessed by RRBS. Results: Overall, MAP3K6 was consistently downregulated in GC samples in compa rison to corresponding adjacent mucosa. Promoter hypomethylation was a common event in tumours, but the methylation profile at the intragenic CpG island was unchanged compared to normal. Conclusions: MAP3K6 down regulation seems to be a common event in GC, correlating with promoter hypomethylation. These observations suggest the existence of a repressor binding site within MAP3K6 promoter, which becomes active upon deme thylation. Further studies are warranted to corroborate these findings as well as to disclose the role of MAP3K6 in gastric carcinogenesis.

Recently, NGS technology provided the spectrum of somatic alterations in several GC series but its usefulness for decision making in clinical practice is still scarce. We aimed at characterizing two GC molecular subgroups and predict targetable molecular signatures, which may guide better therapy selection strategies.

Data was validated in independent TCGA datasets. Results: MSI tumours displayed hypermethylated tumour suppressor genes and activating point mutations in oncogenes. CIN tumours displayed gene amplification at oncogenes and drug resistance genes and hypomethylati on at oncogene promoters. The same type of differential mechanisms was found for Chromatin remodeling, and Cell cycle control, but Splicing factors and RNA binding proteins were affected similarly in both subgroups. Despi te differences in mechanisms, genes encoding targetable oncogenic signal ling proteins were similarly affected in both subgroups.

We recently identified a missense mutation in the human ATP4a gene that causes an aggressive form of familial gastric neuroendocrine tumor characterized by early age of onset, hypoacidity, hypergastrinemia, iron deficiency anemia, muscular infiltration, intestinal metaplasia and adenocarcinoma. Total gastrectomy was undertaken as the final treatment for the affected patients. Materials and Methods: We constructed a knockin mouse model for this mu tation to better understand the pathology developing and search for new therapies Results: Mice mimic most of the alterations described in human patients, in cluding achlorhydria, iron deficiency anemia and hypergastrinemia, which validate the mutation as the primary responsible for this disease. While mice developed severe hyperplasia, dysplasia and glandular metaplasia in the stomach, gastric neuroendocrine tumors or adenocarcinomas as ob served in humans were not observed. Interestingly, gastric acidification by treatment with 3% HCl in drinking water, both prevented (treatment since birth) and reverted (treatment starting at 150 or 250 days after birth) the glandular metaplasia and severe dysplasia phenotype of mice and partially restored the biochemical parameters in stomachs. Conclusions: Preliminary preclinical experiments with HCl drinking water prevent and revert the gastric pathology in mouse model. These results suggest a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of human patients. Fur thermore, the knockin mouse model represents a unique and novel tool for studying pathologies related to stomach acid disturbances.

Results: Our results confir med the regions previously reported as altered in these tumors, including gain of chromosomes 3q, 8q and 11q13 and loss in 3p, 5q and 9p. The pre sence or absence of metastasis/relapses is one of the most important pre dictors of disease outcome.

Only few genes predisposing to familial hematological ma lignancies have been reported until now due to the low occurrence. Few variants that might contributing to the background of genetic factors were reported, this fact encourage us to extend our investigations to other co operating genes. We target several genes previously reported in sporadic hematological malignancies as apoptotic genes (FAS, FASLG, CASP8, CASP10, PRF1 ), proto oncogenes (CRAF, BRAF, CBL), tumor suppressor genes (CEB PA, TP53, RUNX1) and genes involved in several cell process (YY1, ASXL1, NPM1, JAK2). Materials and Methods: In this study, we investigated these 15 candidate genes by direct sequencing in 20 Tunisian familial cases with aggregated hematological malignancies. Results: We report a new ASXL1 germline missense substitution p. Arg402Gln in two related patients that we describe it for the first time in non Hodgkin lymphoma. We report also a PRF1 p.

25998,"Introduction: Glioblastoma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma are high gra de gliomas (HGG). Human MutS homolog2 (hMSH2 ) is the most consistently expressed MMR gene and a key component for mismatch recognition. Pro ficient expression of hMSH2 mRNA is important for efficient functioning of MMR, thereby maintaining micro satellite and genomic stability. We studied the expression levels of hMSH2 and its role in progression free survival (PFS) in high grade glioma. Materials and Methods: Our study group consisted of 39 glioma patients (frontal lobe) and 8 non glioma patients. Expression of hMSH2 mRNA was studied using qRT PCR (ABI Taqman Gene expression assay). Kruskal Wallis test was used for comparison of mRNA expression between various groups. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used for variables with prognosis and Cox proportional hazard regression was used for multivariate analysis. Results: Over expression of hMSH2 with median fold change of 2.48 (Ran ge 0.01 114.98) was found in 51.5% cases significantly different from non glioma tissues (p,0.036). Positive correlation was seen between hMSH2 gene expression and age [r , +0.4 (p,0.01)]. Age, histological type, grade, extent of resection and post surgery adjuvant therapy (RT+CT) were as sociated with PFS of patients in univariate analysis (p<0.05). Low hMSH2 expression with RT+CT was seen to have significantly better prognosis (median,22months), when compared to high expression with RT+CT (median,10months, p,0.011).

25999,"INTRODUCTION: The evaluation of molecular markers in glioma is part of clinical assessment and glioma classification. Mutations in the dehydrogenases IDH1 IDH2 are prognostic markers in glioma, strongly associated with the epigenetic silencing of the O6 me thylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Little is known about the ti ming of MGMT silencing during gliomagenesis, the distribution of MGMT methylated alleles and the potential association with MGMT deletion (10q LOH). We investigated the associations among MGMT methylation levels, IDH genotyping and 10q allelic loss. METHODS: We quantitatively assessed by pyrosequencing the IDH1 R132H allele frequency and the MGMT methylation percentages in 208 primitive glioma samples. The 10q LOH was determined by Short Tandem Repeats genotyping or array CGH. RESULTS: 1. IDH1 was heterozygously mutated in virtually all cancer cells, whereas MGMT methylated alleles were not homogeneously distributed in tumor cells. 2. The MGMT methylation percentages directly correlated with increasing OS.3. The MGMT LOH acts as a late event during gliomagenesis, not related to methylation. CONCLUSION: The incomplete overlap between the percentages of IDH1 mutated and MGMT methylated alleles in tumor cells suggests that only a fraction of tumor cells undergo MGMT silencing, indicating an incomplete association between the two events. Nevertheless, MGMT methylation is a positive prognostic marker irrespective of IDH1 status.

Gprc5a knockout mice spontaneously develop lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas suggestive of a role in cancer predisposition. Within a consanguineous breast cancer (BC) family from Turkey, we identified a ho mozygous frameshift mutation (c.183delG; p. R61Sfs*59) in the first coding exon of GPRC5A in two affected sisters via exome sequencing, suggesting an autosomal recessive trait. Interestingly, Sokolenko et al. (2014) repor ted a ten fold increase of the heterozygous GPRC5A p. R61Sfs*59 mutation in BRCA1 c.5266dupC BC patients compared to BRCA1 negative BC patients. Thus, we hypothesized that GPRC5A acts as recessive BC gene and disease modifier when heterozygously inactivated. While the search for homozy gous or compound heterozygous GPRC5A mutation carriers is ongoing, we genotyped the p. R61Sfs*59 mutation in a large series of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n,1,841), BRCA1/2 negative familial cases (n,5,841) and control individuals (n,8,305). The detailed analysis of the BRCA1/2 mutation car riers, consisting of 1,282 BC, 131 ovarian cancer (OC), 106 BC/OC patients and 322 healthy mutation carriers, revealed that the 17 GPRC5A mutation carriers solely coincide with the BC subgroup (CF,1,33%). Remarkably, the mutation was particularly frequent in BRCA1/2 positive triple negative BC cases (11/540, CF,2.04%) and presented a statistically significant associa tion with this BC subtype (odds ratio: 2.362; 95%CI,1.177 4.627; p,0.007). In summary, we provide evidence for GPRC5A p. R61Sfs*59 as a disease mo difier in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, especially in BC cases affected by the triple negative subtype. We are now starting functional analyses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of GPRC5A p. Arg61fs in BC pathogenesis. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

Introduction: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most common cancer in males in Finland with 5043 new cases in 2015. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified 101 common PrCa susceptibility loci, explaining 33% of familial risk of prostate cancer predominantly in mixed European popula tion. Our aim is to assess the association of selected GWAS Ã¢ÂÂhot hitsÃ¢ÂÂ with PrCa specifically in Finnish men. Materials and methods: In order to subset GWAS variants with strong risk effect we applied the per allele odds ratio (OR) of Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 1.1, and with strong protective effect the OR Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 0.9. Effect allele frequency was chosen as > 0.1. By applying these criteria we selected 37 known risk and 13 known protective variants from 101 GWAS hits in PrCa. Germline DNA samples for common PrCa risk loci were genotyped for 5165 Finnish subjects (n,2764 unselec ted cases, n,2401 controls) within the Collaborative Oncological Gene Environment Study (COGS) using Illumina iSelect custom SNP genotyping platform. Statistical analyses of case control logistic regression model was performed by using PLINK software. Results and Conclusions: 13 of 37 common European risk variants (1/3), and 4 of 13 common European protective variants were not found as sta tistically significant on GWAS level in Finnish samples. The highest PrCa susceptibility variant is at 8q24 CASC8 gene region (p,5.26x10 12), which seems to play an important role in PrCa genetics in Finns.* Information of the consortium can be found at http://practical.ccge.med schl.cam.ac.uk/.",2016

PATIENTS: Patients with breast or ovarian cancer who met the NCCN crite ria for genetic testing with a) prior testing for BRCA genes with NO mutation identified; or b) recently diagnosed (<6 months) and not genetically tested, were enrolled for multiplex cancer testing. RESULTS: From November 14 to February 15, 210 patients were included in the FAMOSA study (109 HBOC). 61 (56%) patients were previously te sted for BRCA1/2 gene mutations with conventional techniques; median age: 44y (22 77); gender: 3 males / 106 females; cancer types: breast 96 (87.3%); ovary 14 (12.7%). Overall 23 (21%) pathogenic variants were identified in 19 patients; 10 BRCA1, 2 BRCA2, 2 PALB2, 3 MYH, 1 CDKN2A; 3 ATM, 1 BRAD1, 1 BRIP1. One patient had an unexpected mutation in CD KN2A gene (gluteus sarcoma age 20; bilateral breast ca; ages 45 and 50; father lung ca, age 70; brother melanoma, age 35). Of 61 patients previously tested, 1 had a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 and 17/19 patients with VUS were classified negative in BRCA genes with the 25 gene panel.

Hereditary breast cancer (HBC) accounts for 5 10% of breast cancer cases. Germline BRCA1/2 mutations explain 60% of HBC, but no other major genes have been identified in the remaining 40%.We decided to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) in affected first de gree cousin pairs displaying features suggestive of HBC, who tested negative for BRCA1/2. Based on their relationship, cousins share 1/8 of the entire genome, which helps filter and select candidate variants. To date, 4 cousin pairs were analyzed through WES and candidate variants were identified in three different genes in 3 pairs, whereas the fourth one shared a BRCA2 deletion not previously identified by Sanger sequencing. The candidate variants, affecting ROS1 , RASAL1 and ICAM5 genes, were confirmed by direct sequencing. Further characterization of the variants is ongoing. In particular, the ROS1 variant affected a predicted canonic splice site, suggesting an effect on the correct splicing of ROS1, a tyrosine kinase receptor that has been implicated in several cancer types. We inserted the wild type or mutant genomic region into a minigene plasmid, transfected it into COS7 cells, and found that the mutant cells used a cryptic intronic splice site 20 bp downstream, leading to the insertion of a premature stop codon in the protein. Future studies will explore the effect of the variant on cell growth/proliferation and invasion in CRISP/Cre modified MCF10A and MCF7 cells. Our findings support previous evidence that many different genes account for the fraction of HBC not related to BRCA1/2 mutations and led us to iden tify promising novel variants for HBC.

26004,"Only two high risk genes involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) have been identified, BRCA1 and BRCA2, that do not explain more than 20% of HBOC cases. In the last years, Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), has been used to find novel susceptibility genes. So far, dominant or polygenic patterns of inheritance have been considered, however, some publications have implemented simulations with different models of segregation in a large number of families which suggests that a part of them could be explained by a model of recessive inheritance, a hypo thesis that has remained unexplored. Five families showing an apparent pattern of recessive inheritance were selected based on: presence of two or more affected siblings with BC at young age, absence of familial antecedents of the disease, availability of the samples and no mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 genes. Through WES, 23 candi date variants following an apparent recessive inheritance model were iden tified and validated by Sanger sequencing. Segregation and loss of heterozy gosity analyses in tumors samples are being performed. A further analysis considering a dominant inheritance pattern was also performed. 30 candi date variants were found in this analysis, including a truncating mutation in ATM, a known HBOC moderate risk gene, which lead us to the conclusion that we cannot rule out other models of inheritance. Case control associati on study in Spanish population is being performed to get insights about the transcendence of these variants in the disease.

26005,"Introduction: Next generation sequencing (NGS) of breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes has recently been shown to be an accurate and cost effective method of performing genetic testing. NGS offers the possibility of screening patients for mutations in high and moderate risk genes other than BRCA1/2. Subsequently, it increases the detection rate of variants of uncer tain significance. Our study aimed to determine the frequency of germline mutations found in Slovene patients using an NGS multigene panel. Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from a group of 306 patients selected in accordance with standard BRCA1/2 testing guideli nes and sequenced at our institution between October 2014 and November 2015. We assessed the frequency of mutations in genes associated with a predisposition to breast/ovarian cancer, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53 , PTEN, STK11, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2 and ATM. Results: Pathogenic variants were detected in 29.4% of our patients. Most mutations were identified in BRCA1 (16.7%) and BRCA2 (7.8%). In additi on, 5.2% carried a mutation in another breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene: 1.9% in CHEK2, ~1% in PALB2 , ~1% in ATM, ~1% in CDH1 and 0.3% in TP53 . One patient carried mutations in both BRCA2 and ATM. Conclusions: With NGS panel testing we were able to detect pathogenic va riants in genes other than BRCA1/2 in ~5% of our patients.

Besides, large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) account for 5 10% of all deleterious variants in BRCA1/2.Molecular characterization of LGRs is essential to know their genetic mecha nisms, identify recurrent alterations, and investigate genotype/phenotype relationships. We used multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or mul tiple amplicon quantification (MAQ) to identify BRCA1/2 LGRs in 1542 he reditary breast/ovarian cancer families referred to three hospitals in Cata lonia. We used long range PCR, CGH arrays, and cDNA analyses to characterize the alterations at molecular level. We found 12 LGRs in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2.Breakpoints were fully characterized in fourteen of them. Six LGRs were novel: deletions targeting exons 1 2, exon 8, exons 16 17, two different de letions of exon 24 in BRCA1 and one duplication of exon 21 in BRCA2. The BRCA1 deletion of exons 16 17 appears to be a Catalan founder mutation explaining five independent families. Both non homologous and homologous events were involved in the aetio logy of the rearrangements. The cDNA analyses showed chimeric RNAs ex pressed by BRCA1 alleles carrying exons 1 2 or exon 24 deletions. Our study substantially increases the spectrum of BRCA1/2 LGRs fully cha racterized at the molecular level. Also highlights the relevance of cDNA ana lysis for a reliable prediction of protein effect of LGRs involving 5Ã¢ÂÂ and 3Ã¢ÂÂUTR expression regulatory regions.(AECC and FIS PI12/02585, FIS PI13/01711 granted by Instituto de Salud Carlos III and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional FEDER).",2016

An evaluation of their effect on mRNA splicing becomes essential to elucidate their clinical impact. In this study we perform experimental and bioinformatic analysis to assess the role in disease development of a set of 36 VUS identified in Spanish high risk breast/ovarian cancer families. Methods: Bioinformatic tools were used to select 15 BRCA1 and 21 BRCA2 VUS with potential splicing effects from 1200 patients screened for BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in genomic DNA. RNA from VUS carriers and 10 control samples was isolated from blood leukocytes. All variants are assessed by RT PCR, agarose gels and direct sequencing. A semiquantitative capillary electrophoresis of fluorescent amplicons is performed to estimate the pro portion of aberrant and normal transcripts. The allele specific transcript expression will also be determined. Results: Aberrant splicing patterns were observed in 5/15 BRCA1 and in 7/21 BRCA2 variants. A preliminary semiquantitative analysis of the BRCA1 c.4675+1G>C and BRCA2 c.8023A>G shows differences in the abundance of the ÃÂ15 and ÃÂ18 isoforms compared to control samples, respectively.

26008,"Introduction: Several Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panels have been developed for hereditary cancer diagnosis, although there is a debate about its cost effectiveness compared to exome sequencing. The performance of two hereditary cancer panels is compared to exome sequencing. Materials and Methods: Twenty four patients were selected: ten with iden tified pathogenic mutations (control set) and 14 suspicious of hereditary cancer but without any identified mutation (discovery set). Two panels, TruSight Cancer (94 genes) and a custom panel (122 genes), were assessed alongside exome sequencing. Results: Eighty three genes were targeted by all approaches. More than 99% of the bases had read depth over 30x (C30) in the panels whereas exome covered 94% of these positions at C30. Variant calling identified the 10 pa thogenic mutations in the control set except for MSH6 mutation c.255dupC in TruSight Cancer. Two hundred and forty unique non silent coding and ca nonic splice site variants were identified in the remaining 14 samples in the 132 panel genes, 7 of them putatively pathogenic in ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, ERCC3, FANCL, FANCM and MSH2. The three approaches identified a similar number of variants in the shared genes. In contrast, WES provides additio nal information. Exomes were on average three times more expensive than panel analyses. Conclusions: Ad hoc panels are an option for genetic diagnostics for heredi tary cancer.

Three Amsterdam positive families were studied. Data analysis was performed using conventional algorithms. Validation studies in familial cancer series and in silico and in vitro functional studies were also carried out. Results: One family harbored two mutations in the MUTYH gene known polyposis (recesive) gene , one recurrent in the European population and the other novel, for which functional studies demonstrated its deleterious nature. The family showed an atypical phenotype for MUYTH, characterized by the absence of polyps, apparent autosomal dominant inheritance, and presence of a mismatch repair deficient tumor. The study of the second family allowed us to identify a novel hereditary CRC gene, FAN1. Functionally relevant mutations were identified in almost 3% of Amsterdam positive families. The third family carried of two mutated genes: a splice site mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, and a missense mutation in a previously proposed cancer predisposing gene.

26013,"Mendelian causes of inherited cancer susceptibility are mostly rare and cha racterised by variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Phenotypic variability may result from a range of causes such as allelic heterogeneity or genetic modifier effects. Another potential cause is the presence of two or more inherited cancer predisposition alleles in the same individual, an occurrence that may feasibly have a number of phenotypic consequences. Although the frequency of such occurrences might be predicted to be low, such cases have probably been under ascertained because standard clinical practice has been to test candidate inherited cancer genes sequentially until a pathogenic mutation is detected. However, recent advances in sequencing technologies now provide the opportunity to perform simultaneous parallel testing of large numbers of inherited cancer genes. We describe five newly identified patients who harbour pathogenic variants in multiple inherited cancer genes. Three cases involve FLCN mutations in combination with those in NF1, TP53 and MSH2 while combinations of MLH1/XPA and BRCA2/NF1 account for the remaining cases. We also un dertook a review of previously published examples to illustrate the complex genotype phenotype relationships in these cases. We suggest that clinicians should proactively consider the likelihood of this phenomenon (referred to as multilocus inherited neoplasia alleles syndrome [MINAS]) in patients with unusual inherited cancer syndrome phenotypes.

The IARC database has about 900 families with germ line TP53 mutation with vast majority being from North America, Europe, Brazil, Australia and Japan. As there are no reports from South Asia, we have done comprehensive clinical & genetic characterization in a large Indian co hort. Materials and methods: Sanger sequencing and Multiplex Ligation depen dent Probe Amplification (MLPA) of TP53 gene was done in 8 classical LFS, 125 LFL and 97 familial cancer probands not fulfilling LFS/LFL criteria. Results: We identified 37 distinct deleterious germline TP53 mutations (2 novel) including 4 LGRs in 42/230 (18%) families. TP53 mutations were identified in 87.5% of classical LFS and 17.6% of LFL families. Surprisingly, deleterious TP53 mutations were identified in 8/97 (8%) families with fa milial cancers not fulfilling any LFS/LFL criteria. Comparing with the IARC database, the genotype phenotype differences in this Indian cohort include 1) Absence of hotspot codon 337 mutation; 2) high frequency of splice site, frameshift and LGRs and low frequency of missense mutations; 4) rarity of adrenocortical cancer and skin cancer. Conclusions: Our study on the largest LFS/LFL Indian cohort reveals distinct clinical and genetic features and highlights the need for TP53 sequencing including MLPA for large genomic rearrangement in suspected LFS/LFL fa milies for counseling and risk management.

26016,"Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) results from heterozygous germline mutati ons of TP53, encoding a key transcriptional factor activated in response to DNA damage. We have recently shown, from a large LFS series including 415 TP53 mutation carriers, that the most severe form of the disease, charac terized by childhood tumours, is associated with missense mutations with dominant negative activity (Bougeard et al., J Clin Oncol 2015). Thanks to a new p53 functional assay that we developed in lymphocytes (Zerdoumi et al., Hum Mutat 2013), we found that dominant negative missense mutati ons, in comparison to null mutations, drastically alter the p53 transcriptio nal response to DNA damage and this assay has now been used to classify 56 distinct TP53 germline alterations. To study, at the genome scale, the func tional impact of heterozygous TP53 mutations on DNA binding, we perfor med chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive parallel sequen cing (ChIP seq) analysis on lymphocytes exposed to doxorubicin, a powerful DNA damaging agent. ChIP seq analyses of exposed control wild type TP53 lymphocytes accurately mapped 706 p53 binding sites. New p53 binding sites were validated using a functional assay in yeast. ChIP seq analysis of LFS lymphocytes with TP53 dominant negative missense mutation reveals only 25 binding sites and, for these sites, the depth of the corresponding peaks was drastically reduced. Altogether, our results show that the clinical severity and predominance of TP53 dominant negative missense mutations are explained by a global alteration of p53 binding at the genome scale and support that LFS results from a defect of the transcriptional response to DNA damage.",2016

26019,"Abnormal Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Microsatellite Instability (MSI) have been observed both in tumoural and normal endometrial biopsies in Lynch Syndrome (LS). The potential use of these findings as markers for en dometrial cancer progression was confirmed in a pilot and is being investi gated in a prospective multicentre study: the LynCE. Methods:58 Lynch Syndrome (LS) carriers are now enrolled and are being followed using gynaecological/ US exam, and endometrial biopsies, accounting for a median follow up of 10.11 months. Endometrial samples are being histo logically diagnosed and evaluated for IHC, MSI, and Methylator phenotype (CIMP MMR).Results:Ã¢ÂÂ¢ All 112 gynaecological/US exams have been normal. 86/87 biopsies re sulted in normal endometrium and 1/87 in endometrial cancer. All (63/63) biopsies were MSI Stable. 32/36 showed normal while 4/36 had CIMP MMR hypermethylation (all from a single constitutional MLH1 epimutation carrier).Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 33% (12/36) patients had abnormal IHC biopsies, 11/12 matching the underlying germline genetic defect. All abnormal IHC samples were hetero geneous, 15/16 also showing adjacent normal IHC areas.Ã¢ÂÂ¢ 3 patients progressed from normal to abnormal IHC (median,13 months) but no other clinical, ultrasound, pathological, MSI or CIMP MMR sign ac companied this progression. Conclusion:Heterogeneous abnormal IHC is present in a subset of normal endometrium biopsies from Lynch Syndrome patients, sometimes evolving from normal IHC. Other abnormalities as MSI (in the pilot study), CIMP MMR, and patho logy changes could follow this IHC abnormality anticipating the progression to endometrial cancer.

26020,"Introduction: The role of multigene panels for hereditary cancer risk as sessment is yet to be established. We aimed at describing the prevalence of cancer predisposition gene mutations identified by a multigene panel in individuals with suspected Lynch syndrome. Patients and methods: We performed germline analysis with a next genera tion sequencing 25 gene panel (Myriad myRiskÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Hereditary Cancer) using DNA from 95 patients with suspected Lynch syndrome (endometrial can cer <50 y o and/or fulfillment of revised Bethesda criteria) from Nov 2014 through March 2015 within the FAMOSA study. We classified all identified germline variants for pathogenicity and calculated the prevalence of patho genic mutations and variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). We analyzed data on patientsÃ¢ÂÂ personal and family history of cancer. Results: We included 95 patients [female: 46 (48.5%), mean age: 48.6+12]: 8 (8.5%) patients with endometrial cancer and 87 (91.5%) with colorectal cancer. Multigene panel testing identified 20 (21%) patients with Lynch syndrome mutations (8 MLH1, 7 MSH2, 4 MSH6, 1 PMS2) and 1 (1%) with a mutation in BRCA2 in a 35 y o woman without personal/familial history of breast/ovarian cancer. In patients diagnosed with mutations in the MMR genes and prior molecular screening (n,9), two displayed MMR proficiency and five patients had a negative prior genetic result by conventional tech niques. Conclusions: In individuals with suspected Lynch syndrome, multigene pa nel testing identified unexpected high penetrance mutations in 1% of cases.

26021,"In about 55% of individuals harboring mismatch repair (MMR) deficient tumors, germline mutations or somatic methylation in MMR genes are not identified, being referred as Lynch like syndrome (LLS). Mutations in POLE and MUTYH and double somatic events in MMR genes have been found in a proportion of these patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular basis of MSH2 deficient LLS cases by means of a comprehensive analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) associated genes at germline and soma tic level. Eighteen LLS individuals harboring MSH2 deficient tumors were included. A customized NGS subexome panel including CRC associated genes was de signed. PBL and matched FFPE DNA from available tumors (4 colorectal, 1 endometrial) were analyzed. Predicted pathogenic germline heterozygous variants in MSH2 , BUB1 , SETD2, FAN1 and MUTYH were identified in 6 of the 18 (33%) cases analy zed. The somatic analysis of tumors demonstrated the presence of: double somatic hits in MSH2 or MSH6 in 2 cases; and apparent loss of heterozygozi ty in MSH2 locus and coexistence of double somatic mutations in other MMR and/or POLE/POLD1 genes in the remaining ones. Also, somatic mutations in other cancer genes (APC, AXIN2, BMPR1A, PTEN or BUB1B ) coexisted with the above mentioned alterations. In all, alterations putatively responsible for LLS were detected in 60% of the cases. The evaluation of germline and somatic mutational status of CRC associated genes by means of a subexome panel is useful for the elucidation of the molecular basis of LS suspected cases.

26022,"Introduction: Lynch Syndrome (LS) is caused by pathogenic germline vari ants in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. However in up to 60% of MMR deficient colorectal cancers no pathogenic germline MMR variant is found. Clinical management of these suspected Lynch Syndrome (sLS) cases remains difficult. Materials and Methods: Using targeted next generation sequencing, we ana lyzed the entire non repetitive genomic sequence, including intronic and regulatory sequences, of 15 CRC susceptibility genes in 34 unrelated sLS patients and 11 patients with MLH1 hypermethylated tumors with a clear family history for LS. In addition, tumor DNA from 28 sLS patients was ana lyzed for somatic MMR variants. Results: Of 1979 germline variants found in 34 sLS patients, one was a pre dicted pathogenic variant (MLH1 c.1667+1delG). The 11 MLH1 hyperme thylated tumors were negative for germline variants in CRC susceptibility genes and for germline MLH1 hypermethylation. However, somatic DNA analysis of 28 sLS tumors identified nine (32%) cases of biallelic somatic inactivation and nine cases with (32%) one (likely) pathogenic somatic va riant. Conclusions: This is the first study in sLS patients to include the entire geno mic sequence of CRC susceptibility genes. An underlying somatic or germ line MMR gene defect was identified in ten of 34 sLS patients (29%). In the remaining sLS patients, the underlying genetic defect explaining the MMR deficiency in tumors might be found outside the genomic regions harboring the MMR and other known CRC susceptibility genes.

26023,"Introduction: Up to 30% of the DNA variants identified in mismatch repair (MMR) genes are variants of unknown significance (VUS). A standardized classification scheme based on quantitative and qualitative algorithms has recently been proposed for their interpretation according to the five class IARC scheme. The aim of this study was to assess the pathogenicity of MSH2 and MSH6 variants by means of multifactorial likelihood calculations. Patients and Methods: Eight variants (5 missense, 2 intronic and 1 small in frame duplication), identified in multiple families or associated to mul tiple tumors, were selected. Four of them had previously been classified as probably pathogenic whereas the remaining were VUS. Frequency in con trol population was searched in public databases. Variants were screened in DNA samples from available relatives by Sanger sequencing. Pathological in formation was collected. Multifactorial likelihood analysis based on estimat ed prior probabilities of pathogenicity, likelihood ratios for segregation and microsatellite instability in colorectal tumors was conducted as described (Thompson et al. 2013).Results: None of the selected variants were reported in control population. The collected tumor data and the results of cosegregation analysis were used in likelihood ratio calculations. Posterior probability of pathogenic ity resulted >0.999 for all the analyzed variants, allowing reclassification as pathogenic mutations of the 8 variants analyzed. Conclusions: These results highlight the benefit of collecting segregation and tumor data for variant classification. Current multifactorial models will likely be improved when information concerning IHC patterns and MSI/IHC results of extracolonic tumors are included.

26024,"Background: Lynch syndrome (LS) patients are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Notably, LS families show a marked intra and inter familial phenotype variability. This might in part be explained by common susceptibility loci, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Previous studies have shown conflicting results and have mainly focused on MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 carriers. We now aim to investigate the role of these SNPs in a large cohort of PMS2 carriers. Methods: Twenty two candidate SNPs from previous Genome Wide Asso ciation studies (GWAS) were selected (rs6687758, rs6691170, rs10936599, rs1321311, rs16892766, rs6983267, rs10795668, rs3802842, rs3824999, rs4444235, rs9929218, rs4939827, rs12953717, rs10411210, rs961253, rs4925386, rs1569686, rs2736100, rs1800734, rs1799945, rs36053993, Rs1048943), which have previously been associated with (sporadic) CRC. These SNPs were genotyped in 353 PMS2 carriers ascertained from family cancer clinics (77 cases, 276 controls). Hazard ratios were corrected for fa milial clustering and calculated using a weighted cox regression analysis to correct for ascertainment bias. Possible effects were examined using both a dominant/recessive and an additive (per allele) model. Results: We found no evidence of an association between CRC risk and cu mulative number of risk alleles (HR,0.99 (95%CI: 0.90 1.08)). Moreover, none of the SNPs individually showed a risk modifying effect. Discussion: There was no evidence of a risk modifying effect of twenty two analyzed SNPs in PMS2 carriers, thus they do not appear to be of any clini cal utility. Other explanations for phenotype variability that warrant further exploration include gene environment interaction and risk modification by other genetic variants.

The average time to secondary malignancy was 62 months: LPN was diagnosed as a first disease in 1 patient (pt) and as a second in 6 patients (pts). Five patients were treated for MPN and two for LPN. Both of the pati ents treated for LPN achieved complete remission. After a median follow up from MPN diagnosis of 149 months, 6 pts are steel alive and 1 died. Cyto genetics was done in 6 patients: 5 pts had normal karyotype, while one pt had abnormal karyotype with derivative chromosome 18. Interphase FISH analysis was performed with CLL panel probes in three patients, showing del(13)(q14.3) in all of them. One patient with MM was analyzed with FISH probes for D13S319, TP53, IGH/FGFR3 and IGH/MAF genes and showed no rearrangements.

A genomic characterization of a set of MPNSTs confirmed the acquisition of hyperploid genomes and recurrent somatic copy number alterations for these tumours. To study the impact of these regional alterations on the transcriptome, mi croarray expression data was used. Mapping on the genome the differential gene expression between MPNSTs and pNFs, we identified transcriptional imbalances (TIs), genomic regions with a significant abundance of over or underexpressed genes. Using information from TIs, some mitotic kinesin ge nes were identified as potential candidates for MPNST pathogenesis, which were functionally characterized in vitro using MPNST derived cell lines. Most of these kinesin genes were significantly overexpressed in MPNSTs in the microarray. Expression knockdown by siRNA of KIF23, involved in telo phase and cytokinesis, showed that KIF23 is essential for cell survival and cell cycle progression of MPNST cell lines. Chemical inhibition of the early mitotic kinesins KIF11 and KIF10 with ispinesib and GSK923295, respec tively, reduced cell viability in a set of MPNST cell lines. Moreover, according to their IC50 values, these lines were more sensitive to these compounds, especially for ispinesib, than a fibroblast cell line. Although in vivo validati on is needed, our results suggest that mitotic kinesins are important players in the pathogenesis of MPNSTs, and we propose KIF11 as a new potential therapeutic target for these tumours.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze DNA imbalan ces using aCGH. Materials and methods: Twelve FFPE tissue blocks of male breast cancer were used for analyze CNA utilizing AffymetrixÃÂ® CytoScan 750K Array. Results: All cases of male breast cancer samples displayed some chromoso mal instability. An average of 179 segmented altered per cases were obser ved (range 16 339). Gains were most frequent than losses (1570 vs 369). The most frequent chromosome regions affected by gains were 1q21 q44, 8q11 q24, 16p13 p11 and 20q, (5/12), 17q and Xq (3/12).

26031,"Background: Microsatellite instability in tumor DNA is defined as the pre sence of alternate sized repetitive DNA sequences that are not seen in the corresponding germline DNA. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a molecular phenotype due to a defective DNA mismatch repair system. The presence of MSI is found in sporadic colon, gastric, sporadic endometrial and the majority of other cancers. Determination of MSI status in CRC has a clinical use in the form of identifying patients with germline defects predisposing to MMR deficiency. Additionally, MSI status has prognostic and therapeutic implications, due to MSI CRCs typically exhibiting a better prognosis. For these reasons microsatellite instability analysis is becoming more impor tant in detecting sporadic primary tumors. Material and methods: In this study we investigated tumoral DNA and tumor marginal DNA of 50 sporadic CRC patients who have not received chemo therapy. Five mononucleotide markers, BAT 25, BAT 26, NR 21, NR 22 and NR 27 were used as a pentaplex PCR panel to evaluate for microsatellite in stability status. Results: Our primary finding showed that MSI was detected in about 40% of specimens. Instability was observed in the tumoral DNA compared to the DNA from the normal DNA sample. Our primary results showed that the fre quency of instability NR 21, BAT 25 and NR 27 markers more than other markers and its frequency almost were similar. Conclusion: Our study showed NR 21, BAT 25 and NR 27 were the most useful markers for diagnosing sporadic CRC, Therefore these markers have shown promise in their potential use for determining MSI status in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer.",2016
26032,"There are three adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer (CRC) suscep tibility syndromes that result from constitutional DNA repair defects. The phenotypes of the constitutional base excision repair defect, MUTYH asso ciated polyposis (MAP), and of impaired exonuclease function of replicative polymerases, polymerase proofreading associated polyposis (PPAP), are characterized by multiple adenomas and/or carcinoma usually diagnosed in adulthood. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) confers a more penetrant phenotype with a high risk for childhood or adolescence onset of polyposis and CRC as well as for other malignancies. Despite the presence of multiple cafÃÂ© au lait macules (CALM) and one pilomatricoma, which serve as diagnostic signposts for CMMRD in young cancer patients, this diagnosis was ruled out by gMSI and mutation analysis of the four MMR genes in a 14 year old boy with polyposis and a rectosigmoid cancer expres sing all four MMR genes.

This somatic hot spot mutation recurrently found in Ã¢ÂÂultramutatedÃ¢ÂÂ sporadic CRC was never before observed as germline alteration. It impairs PolÃÂµÃ¢ÂÂs exo nuclease activity and, therefore, is considered responsible for the phenotype of this youngest reported CRC patient with PPAP . This PPAP case reminis cent of CMMRD raises the question of a skin phenotype that is common to different types of constitutional DNA repair defects and results from post zygotic mutations secondary to the repair defect. Together with anecdotic reports of multiple CALM and pilomatricomas in MAP patients, this case supports this notion and should prompt investigations for skin features in MAP and PPAP patients.",2016
26033,"Mitochondrial anomalies have been linked to carcinogenic processes.

26034,"Introduction: Genomic instability in BCR ABL1 positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is reported to be associated with increased reactive oxy gen species (ROS). The mitochondrial (mt) genome is susceptible to ROS induced mutations due to oxidative stress in the mitochondrion and limited DNA repair mechanisms. Rationale: To describe the mt genomic landscape in CML, and to identify di versity in the apparently uniform leukemic clone. Methods: We performed targeted next generation sequencing on mt geno me in 27 CML patients at diagnosis and after 12 months of therapy. Patients were selected as good (n,15) or poor (n,12) responders based on achie vement of major molecular response (BCR ABL1 IS Ã¢ÂÂ¤0.1%) at 12 months. Mesenchymal stem cells or hair follicles were used to exclude germline po lymorphisms. Results: We identified 87 somatic mutations at diagnosis, in 14/15 good re sponders and in 9/12 poor responders. The number of somatic mutations per patient tended to be higher in good responders than in poor responders. All somatic mutations identified at diagnosis were heteroplasmic, reverting to wild type at follow up. Seven good responders and 5 poor responders had new heteroplasmic mutations detected in follow up samples. The distribu tion of mutations across the mt genome did not differ between good and poor responders, and did not show an excess of G>T transversions that are considered the hallmark of ROS induced damage. Conclusions: MtDNA mutations are common in CML, and identify clonal di versity both at diagnosis and follow up. Mitochondrial mutations are not directly related to ROS damage or clinical outcome.

ORG 291Back to index Methods: Twelve patients carriers of constitutional MLH1epimutations were recruited (8 previously reported). Mutational analysis of MLH1 pro moter and intron 1 was performed by Sanger sequencing. The presence of structural alterations was evaluated using a customized array with 15K probes (Agilent Technologies), surroundingMLH1 gene. Clonal bisulfite se quencing of the promoter was used to determine the methylated allele. In heritance pattern was determined by haplotype and MS MLPA analyses in probandsÃ¢ÂÂ first degree relatives. Global methylome analysis was performed using Infinium 450K array (Illumina). Results: The variant c. 234_ 236del was identified in one of 12 cases ana lyzed and rearrangements in the locus surrounding MLH1 were found in 4 of the 11 analyzed patients. Methylation was confined to a single allele in two analyzed cases, associated to MLH1 transcriptional inactivation. Subsequent methylation and haplotype analyses in relatives revealed intergenerational erasure. Global methylome analysis in the 12 cases revealed thatMLH1 EP M2AIP1 promoter CpG island is the most differentially methylated region of MLH1 epimutants when compared with 21 MLH1 mutation carriers.

Oncogenetics was developed 20 years ago as a clinical and psychological follow up addressing to patients and families with hereditary risk of can cer. Oncogenetic approach developed together with the identification of predisposition genes to breast, ovarian or colorectal cancer, and with the progress in molecular diagnosis abilities. Today, the only molecular techni que accepted and validated for oncogenetic diagnosis is Sanger sequencing of all exons and exon intron boundaries for the known predisposition genes. When completely sequencing and decrypting thousands of DNA nucleoti des, many sequence variants are identified, most of them being single nu cleotide polymorphisms. Current practice classifies sequence variants in a 5 levels frame, from deleterious pathogenic to polymorphic benign. Unfor tunately, more than 40% of the sequence variants found in routine analysis are of unclear pathogenicity. While several biochemical, molecular, genetics and in silico analysis may help in interpreting such variants, there still rest an important percentage with unclear clinical value. Here we present several distinct unclassified variants (UV) and how they could be interpreted for a clinical purpose. Case 1: Validating a UV to benign by in silico or in trans analysis; Case 2: Validating a UV to benign by func tional tests; Case 3: doubts persisting when the result is level 2 Ã¢ÂÂprobably benignÃ¢ÂÂ; Case 4: Segregation and likage analysis for results level 4 Ã¢ÂÂprobably benignÃ¢ÂÂ; Case 5: The ultimate challenge the level 3 absolute unclassified variant.

26038,"Introduction: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the hematological disease charac terized by transformation of B cells into malignant cells. Our aim of the stu dy was to investigate transcriptome profiles in bone marrow myeloma cells by next generation sequencing technology. Method: In this study we performed RNA Seq using the Ion Torrent PGM platform to compare the transcriptome profiles of untreated four MM pati ents and four healthy donors. Myeloma cells (CD38+,CD138+,CD19 ,CD56+ ) and healthy B cells (CD38+ ,CD138+ ,CD19+ ,CD56 ) from bone marrow were selected using cell surface marker in FACSAria II Cell Sorter. Transcrip tome libraries were prepared from rRNA deplated RNA extracted from pool of myeloma cells and healty donors B cells. These libraries were sequenced and aligned the reads to the human genome (GRCh37/hg19) and mapped sequences to the RefSeq database. Result: Here, we characterize transciptional profiles in MM patients. In ad dition, 18806 transcript (17760 of transcripts were reported), 490 deletion, 1397 insertion, 8402 single nucleotide variants 415 reported fusion gene, 983 novel fusion gene were detected. The genes found differentially ex pressed underwent Gene Set Enrichment Analysis by MSigDB. We identified significant overlap between EEF1A1, UBC, UBB, CALR, CXCR4, JUND, FOS, PIM2, JUN, GAPDH, HSP90B1 that was previosly reported upregulation of MM .Conclusion: We were determined some variations and different mRNA ex pression pattern in some previous reported genes that especially in ubi qutin proteosomal pathway.

26039,"The most common recurrent chromosomal change in bone marrow cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5. Finding of the sole del(5q) is associated with good prognosis. Acquisition of additional aberrations during clonal evolution usually leads to rapid disease progression. The aim of our study was to thoroughly analyze bone marrow cells of five MDS patients with sole del(5q) in the original clone and with successive linear or divergent clonal evolution proved in ancestral cell clones. Bone marrow samples were analyzed by conventional G banding, I FISH/mFISH/mBAND (MetaSystems) and aCGH/SNP microarray (Illumina). To detect TP53 mutations, NGS (GS Junior system, Roche) was used. In all five patients, interstitial del(5q), extending between 5q13.4 and ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 292Back to index 5q35.2, encompassed commonly deleted regions 5q31 and 5q33. Clonal evolution concerning 5q included the duplication of deleted chromosome 5 in one sample and new translocation t(X;5)(q13;q12) in the other one. However, additional chromosomal changes acquired during clonal evolution were identified across the whole genome. Most frequently affected chromo some arms were 11q (9x), 11p (6x) and 17p (6x). In four of five patients copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN LOH) of 17p and corre sponding missense mutations of TP53 gene (17p13.1) were found. The evaluation of primary and secondary aberrations is important for iden tification of mechanisms involved in clonal evolution of pathological cells, which can contribute to better understanding of the disease progression and is indeed very important for prognosis of the patients.

26041,"The NBN gene, also known as NBS1, is located on chromosome band 8q21.3 and encodes 754 amino acids protein called nibrin. This protein is a mem ber of the MRN nuclear complex, and is involved in numerous cell processes essential for maintaining genomic stability. Heterozygous variants in the NBN gene, including p. I171V, c.657del5 and p. R215W, have been described as a risk factors for the development of several malignancies. However, there is no report regarding the association of these mutations with lung cancer thus far. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate whether there is an association between heterozygous p. I171V, c.657del5 and p. R215W vari ants of the NBN gene and the risk of developing lung cancer. The frequency of these variants was estimated in a group of 453 adults diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer and in healthy controls (2,400 for p. I171V, 2,090 for c.657del5 and 498 for p.

26043,"Introduction: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) [MIM 162200] is a common dominant autosomal disorder, affecting 1 in 3500 individuals and caused by mutations in the NF1 gene at 17q11.2. Legius syndrome [MIM 611431], caused by mutations in SPRED1 gene (15q13.2), is characterized by clinical manifestations that overlap NF1, as cafÃÂ© au lait spots and freckling. Mate rials and Methods: We screened 1.100 unrelated NF1 patients for mutati ons in NF1 and SPRED1 genes, using direct cDNA sequencing complemen ted with MLPA analysis. Results: We identified 710 mutations in NF1 and 19 in SPRED1 . Among the 710 changes in NF1, 184 (26%) nonsense, 180 (25%) were frameshift mutations, 173 (24%) splice errors, 105 (15%) were missense and 12 (2%) were in frame amino acid deletions/insertions. Fur thermore, using MLPA approach we found 55 mutations (8%): 29 total gene deletions, 23 multiexon deletions and 3 multiexon duplications. The subset analysis of SPRED1 mutated group (n,19) showed 8 (42,5%) missense mu tations, 6 (31,5%) frameshift, 2 (10,5%) nonsense, 2 (10,5%) splice errors and 1 (5%) total gene deletion. RNA analysis allowed us to identify 80/729 (11%) mutations that we would not be able to detect or characterize using DNA based methodologies, as deep intronic mutations or other intronic changes out of canonical GT AG splice sites. Conclusions: Our results con firm that RNA analysis together with MLPA provide a sensitive and speci fic method for the rapid identification of NF1 and SPRED1 mutations.

The primary clinical features of NF1 are multiple cafÃÂ© au lait spots, axillary and inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules in the eye and benign periphe ral nerve sheath tumors or neurofibromas. This disorder is caused by de fects in the tumor suppressor gene NF1 (MIM*613113). Mosaicism has been described to have important clinical implications in a large number of diffe rent diseases; therefore, it also plays an important role in some cases of NF1.During the last 5 years, we have analysed the NF1 gene in more than 150 pa tients using different techniques and approaches, including Sanger sequen cing at mRNA level, NextGeneDXÃÂ® (a post PCR NGS methodology developed and validated by IMEGEN), and MLPA (Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplifica tion) at DNA level. We have identified the disease causing mutation in more than 60% of our studied cohorts and detected all types of truncated germinal mutations: nonsense, splicing site, and small and large deletions/duplications. Besi des, NGS technologies enable the detection of disease causing variations in mosaic. We describe the presence of mosaicism in different tissues and cell lines in two cases. In one case, nonsense mosaicism disease causing change (c.3916C>T; p. Arg1306*) was detected.

A female with early onset breast cancer was found to be a double heterozygote for loss of function mutations in both PTEN and PALB2 genes. Case 2. A rare case of TP53 mosaic event has been detected in a man who was previously diagnosed with four primary cancers. The TP53 missense mutation, located in the DNA binding domain, has been identified in 9.2% of the total reads. Case 3.

26050,"The long terminal repeat (LTR) of human endogenous retrovirus type 9 (ERV9) acts as a germline specific promoter that induces the expression of a proapoptotic isoform of the tumor suppressor homologue p63, GTAp63, in male germline cells. Testicular cancer cells silence this promoter, but in hibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) restore GTAp63 expression and give rise to apoptosis. We show here that numerous additional transcripts throughout the genome are driven by related ERV9 LTRs. 3Ã¢ÂÂ Rapid amplifica tion of cDNA ends (3Ã¢ÂÂ RACE) was combined with next generation sequen cing to establish a large set of such mRNAs. HDAC inhibitors induce these ERV9 LTR driven genes but not the LTRs from other ERVs. In particular, a transcript encoding the death receptor DR5 originates from an ERV9 LTR inserted upstream of the protein coding regions of the TNFRSF10B gene, and it shows an expression pattern similar to GTAp63. When treating te sticular cancer cells with HDAC inhibitors as well as the death ligand TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), rapid cell death was observed, which depended on TNFRSF10B expression. HDAC inhibitors also cooperate with cisplatin (cDDP) to promote apoptosis in testicular cancer cells. ERV9 LTRs not only drive a large set of human transcripts, but a subset of them acts in a proapoptotic manner. We propose that this avoids the survival of damaged germ cells. HDAC inhibition represents a strategy of restoring the expression of a class of ERV9 LTR mediated genes in testicular cancer cells, thereby re enabling tumor suppression.",2016

ESHG. ORG 295Back to index management and targeted therapy. To determine the utility of multigene te sting approach we assessed the frequency of pathogenic variants in 94 pan CPGs in a large epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cohort from a homogenous population of Lithuania. METHODS. Patients with EOC (n,586) w/wo family history (FH) were re cruited through single hospital center (VUHSK HOTC) and germline DNA was sequenced and analysed using Illumina Miseq multigene panels of 94 CPGs, including BRCA1 and BRCA2.RESULTS. Deleterious (class IV/V) mutations were identified in 35,6% all EOC patients. Of these, 29,4% had mutations in BRCA1 (26,5%) and BRCA2 (2,9%) genes, whereas 6,3% harboured mutations in other CPG, including RAD51C, BRIP1, ATM, STK11, MUTYH, MLH1, MSH6, TP53, CHEK2, WRN, FANC. In patients w/o FH pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations were found in 18,3% and 4,2% harboured mutations in other genes. EOC patients with pa thogenic CPG mutations were diagnosed at an earlier age (p<0,001). CONCLUSION. The heritable component of EOC due to mutations in other genes than BRCA1/2 genes is less prevalent and not affected by FH. Clinical utility for newer genes remains to be established.",2016
26052,"Nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) comprises thyroid cancers of follicu lar cell origin and accounts for more than 95% of all thyroid cancer cases. Recently, using NGS technologies and further functional studies, the G534E variant in HABP2 gene has been implicated in familial NMTC. However, the role of this variant has generated the latter scientific comments due to the higher reported frequencies in public database. Subsequently, several co horts of patients from different ethnical origin have been evaluated with dif ferent results reported. Therefore, the added collaborative effort of testing this variant in NMTC families has been requested to further clarify its role. In this sense, we have evaluated the G534E variant in 14 Spanish families with NMTC (13 papillary thyroid cancer, PTC; and 1 follicular thyroid cancer, FTC), including 30 affected and 46 unaffected individuals. As a result, we only found two heterozygous variant carriers, both in the same family, but clearly showing no segregation between PTC and the G534E variant. Specifi cally, there was one PTC patient in this family who does not carry the HABP2 variant and one of the identified carrier was an unaffected individual. In ad dition, we examined this variant in 267 Spanish controls exomas available in the context of the Medical Genome Project. Among them, 6 individuals (2.24%) were heterozygous for the variant (MAF , 0.0112). According to this, our results suggest that the G534E variant in HABP2 might not be asso ciated with familial NMTC in the Spanish population.

Primary tumor, SPT and macroscopically tumor free tissue from SPT were analyzed. This study was conducted using array Comparative Genomic Hy bridization and Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification. Results: The patient was 49 years old male at the time of the primary tumor diagnosis and a heavy smoker (Ã¢ÂÂ¥20 cigarettes/day).Treat ment of primary tumor was radiochemotherapy and surgery for SPT . SPT presented more aberrations than primary tumor. However, primary tumor and SPT shared several genomic imbalances, namely at 17 and 19 chro mosomes. Copy number alterations in genes related with radioresistance and worse prognosis were identified. WT1, CHFR and GATA5 methylated in tumor and macroscopically tumor free tissue of SPT were detected. Three months after SPT diagnosis the patient presented a tumor in larynx.

26054,"Introduction: About 23% of ovarian carcinomas (OC) are related to here ditary conditions, mainly Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome (LS). The identification of germline mutation represents a fundamental step in the management of these patients and their relatives. Patients: 126 women affected by OC referred to our Genetic Counseling Ser vice for a suspected inherited cancer syndrome. 110/126 patients under went BRCA1/2 or MMR germline genetic test based on their family history and/or somatic analyses for MMR defects. Results: Somatic MMR analysis was performed on 45 OC and 14 of these re sulted MMR defective. Six of 14 patients revealed MMR pathogenetic germ line variants, 5 showed variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and 3 had sporadic cancers. In the remaining 96 patients with OC, the germline BRCA test was performed and a pathogenetic variant of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes was identified in 43 women. The global detection rate (DR) of hereditary syndromes was 45% (49/110). Mutated and wildtype patients had the same age of OC onset (50.2ys). Interestingly, the mean age of OC onset in LS pa tients was lower than that of HBOC patients (45ys vs 51.6ys). Regard to hi stological types of OC, in both LS and HBOC patients, endometrioid, serous, clear cells and mixed carcinomas and carcinosarcomas were observed sug gesting that in these syndromes is not involved an exclusive OC histological type. Conclusions: The OC is a sentinel cancer for inherited cancer syndromes identification independently to histological type and age of onset.",2016
26055,"Ovarian granulosa cell tumors are the most common sex cord stromal tu mors and have juvenile (JGCTs) and adult forms. The molecular basis of JG CTs is poorly understood although mutations in the GNAS gene have been reported but only in 30% of the analyzed JGCTs. We have searched for alte rations in other proteins involved in ovarian mitogenic signaling. This led us to detect in frame duplications within the oncogene AKT1 in >60% of the JGCTs studied and point mutations affecting highly conserved residues in tumors without duplications. Subcellular localization analyses of the muta ted proteins and functional explorations using Western blot and luciferase assays showed that AKT1 variants bearing the duplications located at the plasma membrane and were hyperactive. To gain insights into the effects of these mutations and the existence of potential co driver alterations, we per formed transcriptome of four JGCTs. RNA Seq data analyses showed that the duplications were the sole lesions common to the four tumors suggesting a causative role. They also pinpointed a series of differentially expressed genes, involved in cytokine and hormone signaling and cell division related processes. Our results suggested that most of the transcriptomic dysregula tion might be mediated by a limited set of transcription factors perturbed by AKT1 activation. Finally, we show that commercially available AKT inhi bitors can modulate the in vitro activity of various mutated forms. Our study incriminates somatic AKT1 mutations as a major event in the pathogenesis of JGCTs and provide therapeutic leads for a targeted treatment.

26056,"Mutation rates in tumors are higher than basal mutation rates in unaffected tissues. However, given the sheer size of the human genome it is still impro bable that identical mutations are recurrent by chance. To explore this hy pothesized non randomness of somatic mutations we used a pilot dataset of 2049 cancer genomes from the Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes pro ject of the International Cancer Genome Consortium, for which the somatic mutation calls were available from one of the pipelines used in this project. We first normalized the mutation calls to make them comparable across samples and applied the filters provided by the pipeline. To reduce false positives, we removed all calls found in Kaviar or dbSNP , two variant data bases. This left us with ~31 million unique Somatic Single base Mutations (SSMs) of which ~43.000 are recurrent, i.e. present in 3 or more tumours, and ~2 million unique Somatic Insertion/deletion Mutations (SIMs) of which ~130.000 are recurrent. We selected the top 10 ranking recurrent SSMs, SIMs and 2bp deletions, which define 30 sets of samples, to identify genomic and phenotypic events that co occur with the selected recurrent mutation. Multiple sets of samples share, i.a., more mutations between them than randomly selected samples without the specific mutation. Nearly all sets contain samples from different cancer types suggesting relevant pan cancer commonalities. In one such case with samples from colon, stomach and ute rine cancer, the processes behind the non randomness of the mutations may be the DNA damage repair pathways that are often defective in these three cancers.",2016

Introduction: One of the most important events of cancer progression is an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Activation of EMT program is rea lized by mean growth factors, for instance, TGFÃÂ²1. The goal of this project was expression level analysis of genes of master factors that manage develo ping pancreas in cell line Panc1 stimulated with TGFÃÂ²1Materials and Methods: To perform this study we cultivated Panc1 cells du ring 120 hours with TGFÃÂ²1. Changes in the cells were analyzed by Western blot test and qRT PCR for the 4 genes marked EMT and the 13 master factors genes. Result: Stimulation of Panc1 with TGFÃÂ²1 has resulted in changing cell epi thelial to mesenchymal morphology, increasing level of SNAIL and decre asing level of E cadherin. Besides the relative expression levels of SNAI1 and SNAI2 genes increased 6 and 25 fold, respectively, expression levels of CDH1 and KRT8 decreased 25 and 15 fold, respectively. For the selected master genes suppression of expression level SOX9 twice, FOXA2 5 fold and GATA4 4 fold was revealed.

26058,"Introduction: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), most common type of pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with dismal prognosis mainly because it is generally discovered very late and it is resistant to che motherapy. Aside from the role as a major inhibitor neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA (ÃÂ³ aminobutyric acid) has emerged as a stem and cancer cell signaling molecule in different tissues. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the biosynthetic enzyme for GABA, exists in two forms GAD65 and GAD67 that are usually co expressed in various ratios in the GABAergic cells but differ in subcellular localization, kinetics and cofactor binding. Materials and Methods: The RT PCR and immunocytochemistry assays were used to access the gene and protein expression in three PDAC cell lines, Panc1, MiaPaCa2 and HPAF II. Results: Our results show that, in contrast to healthy exocrine pancreas PDAC cell lines express the GAD isoforms, GABA receptors and accumulate GABA. Specific activation of GABA receptors significantly increased the pro liferation rate of these cells. Finally, following the treatment with the chemo therapeutic agent retinoic acid we detected altered expression of GAD65/ GAD67 genes, as well as cancer stem cell transcription factor, SOX2. Conclusion: The identification of molecules and proteins involved in deve lopment and progression of PDAC is critical to develop novel active drugs. Our data provide new insights into the role of GABA in pancreas as a modu lator of cellular proliferation and/or differentiation during tumorigenic cell transformations.

High expression of survivin mRNA has been shown in several hu man cancers including hematological malignancies. However, expression level of survivin in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its prognostic value has not been well studied. Materials and Methods: 41 pediatric B precursor ALL patients and six healthy donors were included in this study. Expression of survivin and its splice variants including ÃÂEx3, 2B, 3B and 2ÃÂ± was investigated by real time PCR both at first diagnosis and in remission periods of patients divided into high (n,16) and standard risk (n,25) groups according to age, white blood cell count and genetic risk factors. In addition, survivin variant(s) that may affect the response to the treatment was also investigated. Results: Expression levels of survivin and survivin ÃÂEx3 were found to be higher in patient group than controls, and survivin 3B was found at in creased levels in high risk group both at first diagnosis and remission pe riods. The ratio of survivin 2ÃÂ±/3B expression was also higher at diagnosis than remission period. Conclusion: Our results suggest that survivin and survivin ÃÂEx3 may be a risk factor for childhood ALL. On the other hand, survivin 3B can be used in risk classification and as a therapeutic target. Survivin 2ÃÂ±/3B and survivin ÃÂEx3/WT may also be taken into consideration in risk classification.

26060,"Introduction: Peutz Jeghers (PJS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predis position syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal hamartomatous po lyposis and mucocutaneous pigmentation. Germline point mutations and partial/whole exon deletions in STK11 can be identified in about 70% and 30% of patients with PJS, respectively. Only a few carriers of large genomic deletions at 19p13.3 encompassing STK11 have been previously reported. Case presentation: A 31 year old woman was referred for genetic evaluation for dysmorphism. Family history was unremarkable. She had normal intel ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 297Back to index lect. In her late teens, a jejunal villous polyp and pseudopolyps of the ileus and cecum had been removed. She had also been noticed to have lip pigmen tation. However, sequencing of STK11 found no mutation. On observation, she presented thick eyebrows, long down slanting palpebral fissures, ocular proptosis, high nasal bridge, hanging columella, black pigmented spots on the lips and a sandal gap. Results: MLPA using DNA extracted from peripheral blood revealed a pro bable total deletion of one copy of STK11: c.(?_ 1100)_(*3276_?); array CGH (NimbleGen CGX 135K, Perkin Elmer) confirmed the presence of a clinically significant interstitial deletion (410.30kb) within 19p13.3. The deletion was de novo and involved 13 OMIM genes, including STK11.Conclusion: PJS features in our patient are a consequence of STK11 haplo insufficiency. Dysmorphisms common to our patient and similar reported cases in the literature support the notion that genes in the neighborhood of STK11 are responsible for a clinically recognizable phenotype. This case strengthens the need to screen for large deletions in patients presenting with PJS together with dysmorphic and/or other atypical clinical features.",2016
26061,"Introduction: Pilocytic astrocytomas, the most common pediatric brain tumor, are low grade gliomas. Although distinct clinical features exist, the histopathological diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma can be challenging be cause of the wide morphologic spectrum and histopathological overlap with high grade malignancies. A MAPK pathway aberration involving BRAF has been reported in pilocytic astrocytomas, but nearly one third lack the pre sence of a unique, detectable genetic hallmark. This study aimed to mole cularly characterize a cohort of pilocytic astrocytomas for identification of additional genetic signatures that may provide additional information to assist in making the correct pathologic diagnosis. Methods: DNA was extracted from archived paraffin embedded tissue from 18 pediatric pilocytic astrocytomas. Microarray was performed using the Affymetrix OncoScanÃÂ® FFPE Assay according to standard protocol (San ta Clara, CA) for identification of clinically relevant copy number variants (CNVs) and regions of copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN LOH).Results: CNVs involving BRAF were identified in 13/18 (72%) of cases: gain encompassing both KIAA1549 and BRAF loci (n,12) and deletion in BRAF (n,1). Whole chromosome gains were the next frequent CNV noted, with recurrent involvement of chromosomes 5 and 6 (n,2). Additional, less fre quent CNVs and CN LOH were present throughout the cohort. Conclusions: Microarray analysis is a cost effective tool for the identification of the hallmark genetic aberrations reported in pilocytic astrocytomas, in cluding deletions and duplications of BRAF .

26062,"Introduction: Genetic tests for Lynch Syndrome are well standardized and broadly used, although there remain some specific difficulties that need to be addressed to reach an optimal diagnosis. The analysis of PMS2 gene is especially complex because of the high number and homology with sever al pseudogenes. We report the problem raised by differences in sensibility and specificity to detect genetic variants depending on polymerases enzyme blends and master mixes used for long range PCRs (LR PCR).Materials and Methods: Two cases with suspicious of Lynch Syndrome were tested for mutations in PMS2 using two different commercial LR PCR kits in parallel (LongRange_PCR_kit, QIAGEN and Expand_LonRange_dNT Pack, Roche). The amplicons generated by LR PCR contained the exons 1 5 (9.964bp), exons 11 12 (8812bp) and exons 13 15 (9804bp). Next, we per formed nested PCR by the same master mix (AmpliTaq Gold 360, Life Tech nologies).Results: Using the first LR PCR kit we detected a new pathogenic variant: 97bp deletion in I01 E02 boundary (c.24 12_109del) that was confirmed in independent experiments and both strands. This mutation could not be detected using the second LR PCR kit. Moreover, the analysis of a second case showed a missense variant in E02:c.137G>T;p.(Ser46Ile) detected by the second, but not with the first LR PCR kit. This variant could not be con firmed in both strands and was considered as an artifact. Conclusions: LR PCR can be used to amplify the PMS2 gene and avoid pseu dogene interference previously to sequence (Sanger or NGS) although a de tailed validation analysis is needed to provide a clinically useful analysis of PMS2.",2016
26063,"Introduction: Lynch syndrome (LS) is caused by pathogenic germline vari ants in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes and patients have a high risk of developing colorectal cancer and other tumors. Microsatellite insta bility (MSI) and loss of MMR protein expression are the molecular hallmarks of LS tumors. Recently, it has been suggested that mutations in POLE and POLD1 genes might explain part of the suspected LS cases without mutati ons in MMR genes. Materials/Methods: We analyzed germline mutations at POLE (exon 13) and POLD1 (exon 11) genes in 327 unexplained suspected LS cases. From these, 158 tumors had normal expression and 165 tumors had loss of expression of MMR proteins. Analysis of MLH1 somatic mutations in tumor was perfor med in one case of interest. Results: We found three mutated individuals among cases with normal MMR protein expression (1.9%). Two cases had POLD1_Leu474Pro mutation and one case had POLE_Leu424Val mutation. These three cases fulfilled Amster dam II criteria. Another individual with the POLD1_Leu474Pro mutation was found among cases with loss of MMR protein expression (0.6%). This patient was dia gnosed of colorectal cancer at age 51 with no family history of cancer. His tumor showed loss of MLH1 expression without MLH1 promoter methyla tion and wild type for BRAF_V600E mutation. Germline analysis of MLH1 did not show any pathogenic alteration. Tumor analysis of MLH1 showed a homozygous/hemizygous nonsense pathogenic variant [(c.1279C>T; p.(Glu427*)] suggesting somatic inactivation of MLH1 as a consequence of POLD1 deficiency. Conclusion: Mutations at POLD1 can induce tumorigenesis via MSI pathway mimicking Lynch syndrome.",2016

Results: Forty tumors showed either one, two or more somatic MMR vari ants predicted to affect function. Nine sLS tumors showed an ultramutated phenotype and were found to carry germline (n,2) or somatic variants (n,7) in the POLE/POLD1 exonuclease domain (EDM). Six of these POLE/POLD1 EDM mutated tumors also carried somatic MMR variants. Four of these tumors showed low or high microsatellite instability.

26065,"Introduction Silencing of tumor suppressor genes by DNA promoter hyper methylation is an early event in carcinogenesis and a potential target for personalized cancer treatment. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) limited knowledge is available about the role of promoter hyper methylation in cancer progression. Materials and methods In present work we have investigated DNA methyla tion of 24 different tumor suppressor genes in 62 patients with various sta ges of HNSCC (34 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 28 oropharyn geal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)) with methylation specific multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MS MLPA). We analyzed genomic DNA extracted from homogenized fresh frozen HNSCC tissue specimens. Results Promoter hypermethylation (Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 2 genes) was observed in 48 of the 62 cases (77%). HNSCC showed frequent promoter hypermethylation in ATM (67%), TIMP3 (67%), RARB (65%), DAPK1 (55%), CDH13 (55%), APC (36%) and IGSF4 (36%). Total number of hypermethylated genes in OSCCs did not differ statistically from the number of total hypermethylated genes in OPSCCs (P,0.7866). Promoter hypermethylation in OSCC didn`t reveal statistically significant differences between the early and advanced tumor stage (P,0.5081). Similarly OPSCC early onset cases didn`t differ from ad vanced stage cancers (P,0.6911).Conclusion Promoter methylation profiling of HNSCC using MS MLPA iden tified ATM, TIMP3, RARB, DAPK1, CDH13, APC and IGSF4 as frequent epige netic events. Observed findings permit the identification of the nature of the tumor but they donÃÂ´t allow the differentiation according the tumor stage.

Our aim is to better understand associations between these variants and PrCa risk, analysing their interactions with the whole genome, by Circular Chro mosome Conformation Capture (4C).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Genomic interactions of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), selected from previous GWAS and fine mapping studies, were investigated in five human prostate epithelial cell lines (LN CaP , DuCaP , PC3, PNT1a and RWPE 1) presenting diverse phenotypes and genotypes. 4C assay design was carried out using 4C Primer Designer for 4C viewpoints program. Libraries were run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (RAPID chemistry). Bioinformatics analysis was performed using the program 4C ker. RESULTS: Preliminary results show numerous interactions between ana lysed SNPs and the rest of the genome.

HOX genesÃ¢ÂÂ proteins resulting from transcription of this gene is as sociated with prostate cancer which plays important role in regulation of Androgen receptors. One of the most important members of HOX family is HOXB13. G84E codon mutation of HOXB13 is reported to be associated with prostate cancer. This study aimed to investigate relationship between pro state cancer and HOXB13 exon 1 2 mutations. Materials and Methods: In this study, 64 prostate cancer patients are invol ved. After DNA isolation, sequence analysis is performed with Big Dye Cycle sequencing PCR technique. HOXB13 exon 1 2 are amplified and sequence analysis is performed with ABI PRISMÃÂ® 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Results: We couldnÃ¢ÂÂt determine any G84E mutation. However, 44 normal homozygote(CC), 16 heterozygote(CT) and 4 mutant homozygote(TT) geno types have been found in 366 base position of the coding region of HOXB13 gene. In addition, 63 normal homozygote and 1 mutant heterozygote(CT) genotypes have been found in 411 position of coding region. Also, 45 normal homozygote(TT), 12 heterozygote(TC) and 7 mutant(CC) genotypes have been found. There was no mutation in exon 2.Conclusions: Previously described 366 and 513 base mutations have been thought as a polymorphism because of no amino acid substitution in pro tein of HOXB13. Due to this reason, there is no association between these mutations and prostate cancer. However, it has been thought that there is an association between 411 base mutations and prostate cancer.",2016

This study indicates a potential prognostic value for GBM treatment planning. Results: MGMT methylation was detected in 13 of the 40 patients (32,5%) and the overall survival time is 19 months for methylated MGMT patients, it is 15 months for unmethylated MGMT patients. MGMT methylation did not significantly associate (p >0,05) with overall survival time MGMT promoter methylation did not correlatewith overall survival (OS; p >0,05).RARB methylation was detected in 24 of the 40 patients (60%). The over all survival time of the patients with methylated RARÃÂ² was 19 months, and nonmethylated RARB was 15 months. The statistical analysis shows that the patients who received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment combined had a survival time of 25 months. The patients who received only radiotherapy or had no treatment protocol had a survival time between 15 20 months, which demonstrates a significant difference (P<0.05).

Since FAT10 is an ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 299Back to index oncogene, and mutations/polymorphisms can influence susceptibility to cancer, we hypothesized that mutations/polymorphisms within the FAT10 gene will modulate the expression / function of the FAT10 protein and be associated with differential risk for the development of HCC and/or diffe rences in clinical outcome. The architecture of polymorphisms in the FAT10 gene is noteworthy. For such a small gene like FAT10 with an open reading frame of ~500 bp, it has ~9 single nucleotide polymorphisms within its coding region of which 8 were non synonymous and 4 were also non conservative changes. This ob servation suggests that many of these polymorphisms can potentially affect function and perhaps even modulate its tumorigenic properties. Interestin gly, the haplotype of polymorphisms in the different ethnic population as well as between healthy individuals and HCC patients are also different sug gesting that variability of the polymorphisms in the different ethnic groups may account for variability in susceptibility to cancer development.

26070,"A large fraction of pathogenic BRCA2 variants impairs mRNA splicing in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. Missense, synonymous or in frame de letion/insertion variants are usually classified as variants of uncertain si gnificance. The best method to identify splicing aberrations is based on the study of patient RNA, but that is often difficult to obtain. Minigene based technology is an alternative approach to test candidate splicing variants wi thout the need of patient samples. To study this process we constructed a large minigene in the pSAD plasmid with exons 14 to 20 (MGBR2_ex14 20) to keep the genomic context. Here, we focus on exons 17 y 18 because of the atypical GC donor in exon 17. The intronic GT dinucleotide is the most conserved element of the donor splice signal. However, in a small fraction of the donor sites (<1%), GT is replaced by GC that are rather located in alternatively spliced introns. A total of 226 variants were analysed with NN Splice and HSF so that 48 of them were selected to assay. They were intro duced into MGBR2_ex14 20 by site directed mutagenesis. Minigenes were transfected into HeLa and MCF7 cells to examine their transcripts. We found that 22 variants (45.8%) produced abnormal transcripts. Moreover, micro deletion assays showed that the 3Ã¢ÂÂ region of exon 17 and the 5Ã¢ÂÂ of exon 18 were essential for exon recognition and might contain splicing enhancer sequences.

Materials and Methods: DNA was isolated from 73 lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma FFPE tissues. Real time PCR using GAPDH as a reference gene was performed and Relative gene amplification was calculated using the normalized ratio. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v21 stati stical package. Results: Relative gene amplification was detected as follows: FGFR1 12.3%, MET 15.1%, DCUN1D1 38.4% and BCL9 43.8%.

Here we present a library preparation method to enab le high quality libraries for target enrichment, utilizing a variety of sample types. For hybridization capture, libraries were constructed from 1 100 ng of Co riell HapMap samples, clinical FFPE, circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) and Horizon Discovery reference DNA using a novel library preparation method.

It develops and progresses through accumulation of genetic alterations the most common being point mutations in BRAF and RAS genes and RET/PTC rearrangements, all of which activate the MAPK pathway. We used NGS technology for analysis of potentially pathologic mutations predisposing to the development of familial papillary thyroid carcinoma (FPTC) in affected families. Materials and Methods: DNA from peripheral blood was isolated from 23 individuals (11 patients with FPTC, 2 patients with other thyroid disorders and 10 unaffected relatives). We used TruSight Cancer sequencing panel (Il lumina) targeting 94 genes and 284 SNPs. Results: In our study we selected 44 missense variants, four of which are pathogenic ÃÂ¾r potentially pathogenic. In our first family we determined the variant FANCD2_c.1137G>T associated with Fanconi anemia. In the second family we proved three variants associated with Fanconi anemia: FANCA_p.

26074," Familial Non Medullary Thyroid Cancer (FNMTC) accounts for 5 7% of all NMTC. Since these patients develop more aggressive tumours with worse outcomes compared to the sporadic counterparts, the identification of the susceptibility genes is crucial for treatment and surveillance. Whole exome sequencing in a multigenerational family affected by FNMTC with oncocytic features, revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in MYO1F gene, encoding for an unconventional myosin and mapping to chromosome 19p13.2, where our group previously identified a predisposing locus. Cell lines stably expressing mutant MYO1F showed more mitochondria, an al tered mitochondrial network and increased levels of endogenous and ex tracellular ROS, compared to cells overexpressing the wild type protein or the empty vector. The mutation also conferred a significant increase in col ony formation, invasion and anchorage independent growth, along with an over activation of ERK1/2 pathway. These results suggest that the MYO1F variant is the mutation underlying the linkage locus previously mapped at chromosome 19p13.2.192 independent FNMTC patients were screened to identify additio nal predisposing variants in MYO1F. We identified a rare silent change (rs184748543G>A) altering an Exonic Sequence Enhancer (ESE) in one patient and his affected sister. In vitro transcription analysis using a mini gene containing plasmid showed that the rare A allele determines an exon skipping, leading to an in frame deletion of 43 amino acids, which alters the ATP binding domain in MYO1F.

Here, we comprehensively characterize the muta tional profiles of diverse transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) across 1,574 completely sequenced cancer genomes encompassing 11 tumour ty pes. We assess the relative rates and impact of the mutational burden at the binding sites of 81 transcription factors (TFs), by comparing the abundance and patterns of single base substitutions within putatively functional bin ding sites to control sites with matched sequence composition. There is a strong (1.43 fold) and significant excess of mutations at functional binding sites across TFs, and the mutations that accumulate in cancers are typically more disruptive than variants tolerated in extant human populations at the same sites. CTCF binding sites suffer an exceptionally high mutational load in cancer (3.31 fold excess) relative to control sites, and we demonstrate for the first time that this effect in seen in essentially all cancer types with sufficient data. The sub set of CTCF sites involved in higher order chroma tin structures has the highest mutational burden, suggesting a widespread breakdown of chromatin organization. However, we find no evidence for selection driving these distinctive patterns of mutation. The mutational load at CTCF binding sites is substantially determined by replication timing and the mutational signature of the tumor in question, suggesting that selec tively neutral processes underlie the unusual mutation patterns. Pervasive hyper mutation within transcription factor binding sites rewires the regu latory landscape of the cancer genome, but it is dominated by mutational processes rather than selection.",2016
26076,"Introduction: Upregulation of protein synthesis, deregulation of tRNA ex pression and amino acid starvation are common features of cancer. The oc currence of these events raises the hypothesis that translational fidelity is compromised in tumors(1,2). However, the relevance of tRNA misreading in cancer is still unknown. To clarify the role of tRNA misreading in cancer development, we expressed misreading tRNAs in a near normal cell line and studied UPR and cancer associated signaling pathways. Materials and Methods: NIH3T3 cell line was stably transfected with pIRES2 DsRED plasmids containing the tRNASer(WT), tRNAs that misincor porate Serine(Ser) at Alanine(Ala) GCU or Leucine(Leu) CUU sites and also an empty plasmid. Cell lines were injected in mice and their tumorigenic po tential was evaluated. tRNA expression both in cell lines and in tumors was determined by SNaPshot sequencing. Alterations in UPR and cancer related pathways were accessed by western blot. Results and Conclusions: We report an unexpected role for misreading tRNAs in tumor growth. Our data show that expression of misreading tRNAs produce tumors with similar growth rate to K ras induced tumors. Remark ably, expression of misreading tRNAs increases in vivo, suggesting advan tageous features of this phenotype. Our results also showed that Akt and UPR pathways are activated in a microenvironment dependent manner. Ac cumulating evidence has demonstrated that UPR activation and decrease in translation fidelity are required for cancer cells to maintain malignancy and acquire therapy resistance, suggesting that compromising translation fidel ity may select adaptative mutations. Our results support the hypothesis that mistranslation phenotypes have a role in tumor growth, worth to explore further.

26077,"Chromosome structural rearrangements, such as translocations, inversions and insertions, are aberrations involving one or more chromosomes and are relatively common in human population. They are defined as Ã¢ÂÂbalancedÃ¢ÂÂ if they do not lead to a gain or a loss of genetic material and Ã¢ÂÂunbalancedÃ¢ÂÂ when they are associated with duplications or deletions at breakpoints or as a consequence of malsegregation during cell division. Rearrangements associated with more than two breakpoints are rare and they have a higher probability of a pathological outcome, because of gene disruption or of a not correct segregation pattern. We describe a complex rearrangement involving chromosomes 7 and 10 with 4 different breakpoints in an asymptomatic man and in his son, the latter presenting with developmental delay, speech delay, growth retarda tion, microcephaly, hypospadias and dysmorphic features. The child inhe rited both the paternal derivatives but the rearranged chromosome 10 also harboured an interstitial duplication due to a recombination event. During paternal meiosis, two different crossing over occurred upstream and down stream the 10q21.1q23.31 region, between the derivative 10 chromosome and the normal chromosome 10 homologous, bringing back a copy of the missing portion in its original position. As a consequence the child harbou red a 32.4 Mb duplication of chromosome 10, characterized by array CGH. The involved region completely overlaps the critical 10q22.3q23.3 region, whose duplication is described in association with microcephaly, develop mental delay, speech delay, growth retardation and dysmorphic features.",2016
26078,"The great majority of apparently balanced translocation are associated with normal phenotype, although a small percentage of carriers shows abnormal phenotypes. One of the mechanisms proposed to explain this phenomenon is the presence of a cryptic complex chromosomal rearrangement (CCR).CCRs are structural anomalies involving at least three chromosomes or three breakpoints. The use of FISH assays and DNA microarray technologies for the characterization of CCRs has allowed the identification of cryptic im balances at breakpoints sites. We report a girl, carrier of an apparently balanced translocation t(3;11) inherited from her healthy father, showing psychomotor delay, dysmor phic features, microcephaly, hypertrichosis, hypotonia, seizures and pre cocious puberty. Array CGH analysis highlighted the duplication of two not contiguous regions of the long arm of a chromosome 5, extended 6 Mb (5q31.1q31.3) and 3,2 Mb (5q34) respectively. FISH assay, also performed on paternal chromosomes, revealed a more complex rearrangement invol ving chromosomes 3, 5 and 11. The child inherited the derivative chromo somes 3 and 11 and the normal chromosome 5, therefore showing the two duplicated regions of 5q as consequence of malsegregation of the paternal balanced CCR. Of note, 5q31.1q31.3 duplication overlapped the critical region of 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome characterized by hypotonia, seizures, developmen tal delay and facial dysmorphisms. Our patient shared many of these fea tures, suggesting the existence of a distinct phenotype associated with the reciprocal duplication of the 5q31.3 microdeletion syndrome.",2016
26079,"Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease with an adult onset characterized by iron refractory anemia, retinal degeneration, diabetes mellitus and various neurological symptoms (including ataxia, involuntary movements, parkinsonism, depression and cognitive dysfunc tion) due to iron accumulation in the brain and viscera. It is caused by the absence of ceruloplasmin ferroxidase activity due to mutations in the ceru loplasmin ( CP) gene. Diagnosis is based on the absence of serum ceruloplasmin and some com bination of low serum copper concentration, low serum iron concentrati on, high serum ferritin concentration as well as hepatic iron overload. The diagnosis is strongly supported by characteristic MRI findings of abnormal low intensities reflecting iron accumulation on the brain and liver. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is based on intravenous and oral iron chelators, which have been associated with improvement in diabetes and neurological symptoms. Com bined intravenous desferrioxamine and fresh frozen human plasma (FFP) is effective in decreasing iron content in the liver. Antioxidants such as vitamin E and oral administration of zinc may prevent tissue damage.

26080,"Introduction: Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the main inherited cause of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Mutations in polycystin 1 gene are responsible for 85% of the cases. The variant c.7837_7839del (p. Leu2613del) is an in frame deletion of three nucleotides, resulting in the deletion of one amino acid in polycystin 1. It was already described in Human Gene Mutation Database but its pathogenicity was so far undetermined. Cases Presentation: we describe an ADPKD family with several members affected by a de novo genetic mutation. CKD was diagnosed in the mo ther at 38y, who started hemodialysis at 41y. The first son presents CKD at 33y. The second son had CKD since 24y, having started hemodialysis at 28y. A niece had the diagnosis at 13y without Renal Failure yet. The variant c.7837_7839del (p. Leu2613del) was found in all patients. The mutation was not found in a daughter who did not present disease criteria. Awaiting gene tic study are sixteen relatives with ADPKD (6 started dialysis early).Conclusion: The mutation variant c.7837_7839del in the polycystin 1 gene was the only one found in four affected family members (three in first de gree) and was absent in a relative without the disease, confirming its pa thogenicity. Many cases developed early severe CKD, in favor of a mutati on with high pathogenicity. The early and severe manifestations of ADPKD make relatives seek reliable prenatal diagnosis. Therefore, every new case of a rare genetic mutation should be reported in order to obtain a more preci se genotype/phenotype correlation, improving risk evaluation and genetic counseling.

26081,"Introduction: Alopecia areata (AA) is a T cell mediated autoimmune disease characterized non scarring, patchy loss of hair in the scalp and elsewhere. Onset of AA may occur at any age. Incidence is equally distributed across races and genders. ItÃ¢ÂÂs etiopathogenesis is exactly uncertain yet. AA has a multifactorial etiology that both several genes and environmental factors come together with a different weight in triggering the pathology. Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor super family, is a transmembrane receptor involved in apoptotic si gnal transmission in many cell types and play essential roles in many human autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between the 1377 G>A promoter polymorphism in the FAS gene and risk of AA. Materials and methods: The study group included 200 patients with AA and 165 healty volunteers. Genotyping for the FAS 1377 G>A polymorphism was performed by Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Po lymorphisms (PCR RLFP) method. Results: A statistically significant difference was observed between patients and controls according to genotype and alleles frequencies of FAS gene 1377 G>A polymorphism (p , 0.007 and p , 0.000, OR 1.98, 95 % CI 1.35 2.92, respectively). Conclusion: According to our findings, the FAS 1377 G>A polymorphism is associated with AA. The presence of the A allele is thougt to protective to AA.

26082,"Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is caused by mutations in the SERPI NA1 gene predisposing to early onset emphysema and liver cirrhosis. The most common mutations known to cause AATD are the deficient Z (Glu 342Lys) and S (Glu264Val) variants. Nevertheless, SERPINA1 gene is very polymorphic, and more than one hundred genetic variants have been descri bed. We aimed to identify and characterize new variants of SERPINA1 gene in patients with decreased levels of serum AAT that cannot be explained by the genotype after analysis of Z and S alleles. We selected eight patients who fulfilled these criteria and performed sequence analysis of all coding exons of SERPINA1 by Sanger sequencing. We found seven previously unidentified missense variants, four of them located in exon 2, two in exon 3 and one in exon 4. Molecular characterization of these variants was performed by in vitro expression of mutant proteins generated after directed mutagenesis. We evaluated by western blot analysis the expression of monomeric AAT protein and the formation of polymers. In addition, protein aggregates were detected by Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) positive staining. Finally, an elastase assay was conducted in order to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the mu tants. In conclusion, we have identified novel variants of SERPINA1 gene that can help to explain the discrepancies found between serum AAT levels and genotype. These results suggest that rare variants might be more frequent than expected, and therefore standardized PCR screening of the S and Z al leles should be complemented with sequencing of the gene in discordant cases.",2016
26083,"Alport syndrome (ATS) is a clinically heterogeneous progressive nephropa thy, characterized by extreme phenotypic and genetic variability. Monoge nic inheritance model is well known and different patterns of inheritance have been previously recognized ranging from autosomal to X linked mo dels. We have recently reported digenic inheritance for the disease. Here, we go further and we describe a new series of cases with more complex mechanism of inheritance for ATS unmasked by the increased use of high throughput sequencing which keeps unveiling unexpected combinations of pathogenic mutations lying either on the same allele or on different genes. Families with X linked inheritance and unusual severity in females harbor two pathogenic mutations on the same COL4A5 allele. Families with appa rent dominant pattern of inheritance are rather due to a digenic transmissi on of two causative mutations inherited in cis and lying in the two collagen 4 genes linked on chromosome 2 (COL4A3/COL4A4). Moreover, two distinct mutations on the same two genes, inherited in trans, are responsible for ATS following an apparent autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and inter mediate severity. A more complex inheritance is shown when an autosomal mutation is combined with an X linked mutation. Overall, these results re veal that ATS transmission pattern overcomes the Mendelian inheritance, which can thus easily trick the clinical geneticist. This finding leads to recon sider the recurrence risk and opens new perspectives in the management of genetic and prenatal counseling for ATS.",2016
26084,"Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease, characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of pathogenic links between MS and abnormalities in alternative splicing (AS). Among splicing regulators, besides hnRNPs and SR proteins, long noncoding RNAs (lncR NAs) are emerging as critical players in pre mRNA AS. Here, we aimed at exploring the role of MALAT1, an abundant lncRNA reported to influence AS through its interaction with pre mRNA splicing factors. Materials and Methods: The expression levels of several splicing regulators, as well as the AS pattern of specific MS related genes, were evaluated in HEK293, HeLa, and SH SY5Y cells after MALAT1 overexpression or downre gulation. Gene expression analysis was performed by real time RT PCR and RNAseq analysis. Results: Upon MALAT1 modulation, expression levels of splicing regulato ry genes, such as HNRNPF and CELF1, were significantly dysregulated in a cell specific manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MALAT1 overex pression/silencing influence also the AS pattern of IL7R and PRKCA genes, previously associated with MS susceptibility and characterized by the pres ence of a SNP acting on splicing. Intriguingly, we also detected a significant upregulation (1.4 fold) of MALAT1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients respect to controls (P<0.05).Conclusion: In this work, we provide evidence of a functional link between the lncRNA MALAT1, AS regulation and MS associated AS events, suggesting a potential role of MALAT1 in MS pathogenesis.",2016

B lymphocytes from patients and controls were aisled from peripheral blood by Ficoll method. B cells were immortalized using Epstein Barr Virus and grown. Lymphoblastoid Cell line were analyzed by flow cytometry and separated based on the cell cycle phase by Sorting. With patients and controls RNA, we realized a RT PCR and we analyzed BMPR2 gene expression with TaqMan assay. After analysis of BMPR2 gene expression by qPCR, we detected expression for BMPR2 gene in Lymphoblastoid Cell line from controls. The normalized gene expression results in BMPR2 gene, using GADPH as reference gene, shows a greater expression levels in G2/M phase, followed by G0/G1 phase and, finally, in S phase. However, sorting cell analysis show changes in ploidy from patients relative to controls. The results of BMPR2 gene expression in patients, will tell us if there are any expression differences between patients and controls. Although the availability of a tissue that express BMPR2 like lung is a pro blem, the expression analysis of the mutated gene by this technique, allowed us to analyzed how mutations in BMPR2 could interfere in the expression levels of this protein.",2016
26086,"Chromothripsis was first described in 2011 in somatic cells and is pro posed to constitute the basis for complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCR) seen in 2 3% of all cancers. These CCR were rarely reported in con stitutional field. Here, we report CCR discovered in two patients harboring syndromic intellectual disability. The first case is a young boy with growth retardation, moderate intellectual disability, delayed speech, oral dyspraxia, hair ichthyosis, thin nails and facial dysmorphism. Karyotyping showed a ring 21 chromosome with 8 CNVs: 3 losses of 1.2 to 7.4 Mb and 5 gains of 162 kb to 2.8 Mb revealed by array GGH (aCGH) and confirmed by FISH. To reach basepair resolution of these anomalies, paired end whole genome sequencing (WGS) (2x100bp) was performed on a NextSeq500 (Illumina). WGS confirmed all CNVs previously identified and pointed out three addi tional small CNVs (2 losses, 1 gain) and the presence of 4 inversions for a total of 23 chromosomal breakpoints. The second patient is an adult with mild intellectual disability, language delay and cleft palate carrier on the karyotype of a double chromosome 3 inversion (46,XX, inv(3)(p13; p22), inv(3)(p12; q26.3)) without pathogenic imbalance identified using aCGH. WGS revealed a more complex rearrangement with 12 breakpoints. The dis ruption of FOXP1 gene can explain Patient 2Ã¢ÂÂs phenotype. Overall, while Pa tient 1Ã¢ÂÂs phenotype is due to a large copy number change (losses and gains), the second case shows the importance of breakpointsÃ¢ÂÂ characterization of balanced chromosomal rearrangement and the potential underestimation of CCRs incidence",2016
26087,"Certain regions of the human genome are predisposed to non allelic homo logous recombination (NAHR) resulting in copy number variants (CNVs). Ethnic differences have been observed with some CNVs. We previously re ported a consanguineous Irish Traveller family with PCD and laterality due to homozygous mutations in CCDC103 (17q21.31). The mother (patient A) and affected children had a co existing chromosome 17q12 duplication. The 17q12 duplication and CCDC103 mutation are in cis, ~6Mb apart. Patient AÃ¢ÂÂs husband (her first cousin) does not carry the 17q12 duplication indica ting that a) this was a recent evolutionary CNV event either in patient A or her mother (husbandÃ¢ÂÂs maternal aunt) or b) there has been a recent recom bination event. We now report a second Irish Traveller family with a 17q12 duplicati on, identical to the first. This child (who has autism) also has a de novo neurexin 1 deletion (2q13.1). The families are not related and come from different geographical areas. Further analysis revealed that family 2 do not carry the CCDC103 mutation suggesting that a) the duplication arose as an independent de novo event in family 2 or b) recombination has separated the CCDC103 mutation from the duplication in previous generations. A review of 17q12 duplications identified within our centre revealed only three other cases, all in non Traveller families. Conclusions: The Irish Traveller population number ~40,000, out of a total population of 4.6 million, within the Irish Republic. Our discovery of two unrelated Irish Traveller families with a 17q12 duplication suggests that the genomic architecture at 17q12 in this population may predispose to this CNV.",2016
26088,"Chromothripsis is a novel phenomenon in the structural variation lands cape of cancer genomes. We analyzed the genomes of three patients with congenital disease without apparent karyotype anomalies. The rearran gements displayed unanticipated complexity resembling chromothripsis. The array CGH analysis identified complex chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 (Case 1), 12 (Case 2) and 1 and 4 (Case 3). Case 1 presented a complex clinical phenotype in which coexisted 3 known dis orders: Potocki Lupski syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease and neu rofibromatosis type 1. Case 2 showed intellectual disabilities with autistic traits and a particular stromal corneal dystrophy, at the moment described only in adult subjects. Case 3 exhibited a complex clinical picture, not im mediately framed with 1p36 deletion syndrome (array CGH revealed a 3 Mb deletion in 1p36). With whole genome sequencing we investigated the genetic architecture of these constitutional complex chromosomal rearran gements (CCRs),copy number profiling, and breakpoint junctions proving that the rearrangements (deletions/duplications/inversions) identified in our cases were not clustered on a single chromosome region, but on the whole length of the chromosomes. These findings provide additional infor mation suggesting that chromosome shattering and nonhomologous repair may be a common mechanism underlying chromothripsis rearrangements associated with developmental malformations.",2016
26089,"Complex chromosomal rearrangements, including chromothripsis, are emerging as important phenomena in both somatic and constitutional di sease. Whole genome sequencing technologies capable of base pair level resolution of chromosomal fusion events, rearrangements and copy num ber changes now allow us to understand complex aberrations in fine detail. We present results from five complex cases using a combination of Illumina Nextera mate pair sequencing and PCR free paired end (PE) sequencing. Two are cases of intrachromosomal chromothripsis affecting chromosome 1 and chromosome 21 respectively. The chromothriptic chromosome 21 was identified in a patient with heart anomalies and dysmorphic features, de ceased at 5 mo. Molecular cytogenetic characterization with customized ar ray comparative hybridization (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) had previously identified four deletions and five duplications. Whole genome sequencing elucidated break and fusion events at basepair resolu tion. BioNano Genomics IRYS nano channel single molecule mapping was applied for corroboration. CNVs were estimated in excellent concordance with CGH using low pass short read coverage data, but at higher resoluti on, corroborating uncertain single probe signals. Discordant read pair data from low pass mate pair sequencing was sufficient to give a clear overall pic ture, improving over FISH reactions in all five cases. The added full coverage paired end sequence data improves fine detail of complex rearrangements in fusion points. SNVs further add information with runs of autozygosity in deletions, and fractional allele ratios as expected from duplications. In summary, genome sequencing technologies elucidate even highly complex chromosome rearrangements, reducing analysis time, labour and increasing resolution over hybridisation based methods.

26090,"Accurate characterization of complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCRs) in non affected individuals is crucial as their presence may result in repro ductive failure, recurrent miscarriages or children with malformations. Here, we present a family, initially referred 10 years ago, where the non affected father and daughter were found, using FISH and karyotyping, to be carriers of a balanced three way translocation [t(6;7;10)(q16.2;q34;q26.1), de novo in the father]. The family suffered from two stillbirths, one miscar riage, and has a son with severe intellectual disability. In the present study, the family was revisited using whole genome mate pair sequencing (MPS) and Sanger sequencing to further characterize the CCR in the father and daughter. MPS allowed accurate reconstruction of all derivative chromosomes in volved in the translocation. Interestingly, it revealed an additional cryptic translocation breakpoint on der(6) (1.37Mb proximal to the 1st breakpoint) rendering the rearrangement even more complex. The interstitial segment created was translocated onto der(10) proximal to the translocated seg ment from chromosome 7.SIM1, GRIK2, CNTNAP2, and PTPRE genes were disrupted at the break points. As some of these genes have been proposed as candidate dominant genes for developmental delay, clarifying the consequences of the disrupti on at the protein level will provide important information about the func tion of the genes. In conclusion, MPS proved highly successful in identifying additional com plexity, not detectable by FISH, in two non affected complex translocation carriers. We propose that such CCRs should be studied with NGS in combi nation with other methods to aid in correct prenatal, preimplantation gene tic diagnosis and counselling in couples with reproductive problems.",2016
26091,"Introduction: Inverted duplications with terminal deletions have been de scribed with different chromosomes involved. Since the widespread use of array CGH increasing number of publications revealed the possible me chanisms of its development as non allelic homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining resulting in a dicentric chromosome, in which a breakage fusion bridge cycle and telomere formation lead to this type of rearrangement. In the vast majority of the known cases the duplicated re gion is larger than the deleted segment. In the patient presented here the situation is exactly the opposite. Methods: Routine cytogenetic investigation was indicated in a 5 year old child because of muscle hypotonia, clubfoot, genital hypoplasia, minor ano malies and delayed development. The deletion of terminal 18q detected by karyotyping (450 bands), however, didnÃ¢ÂÂt provide sufficient explanation for the severity of the symptoms, therefore array CGH analysis using Agilent Sureprint 8x60K oligo array (ISCA v.2) was performed. Results: Array CGH detected a 2,166 Mb duplication affecting 18q21.31q21.32 and a 21,5 Mb contiguous deletion of 18q21.32q23. In pos session of the results the more complex clinical features compared to Ã¢ÂÂpureÃ¢ÂÂ deletion 18q syndrome could be explained, allowing for a more thorough genotype phenotype analysis. Conclusions: The application of high resolution molecular cytogenetic ana lysis methods is of great importance even in cases where the karyotyping detects abnormalities which correlation with the clinical picture is clear. In order to understand the formation of chromosomal rearrangements better, the use of array CGH analysis providing copy number data for the regions adjacent to the breakpoints is recommended.",2016
26092,"The recent development of genome wide chromosome conformation cap ture (Hi C) has permitted the study of chromatin interactions within the nucleus. The resulting interactions maps show that that genomes can be divided into large local chromatin domains termed Topologically Associated Domains (TADs). Within TADs, the genome appears to be organized to favo ur strong internal chromatin interactions rather than external interactions with neighbouring TADs. It has also been suggested that TADs might help to de lineate basic genomic functions such as gene regulation. Interestingly, TADs also appear to be conserved across species and cell types. Comparative genomics has revealed the existence of conserved non coding elements (CNEs) in vertebrates. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the se non coding units are cis regulatory elements associated with key deve lopmental genes. Using CNEs clusters extracted from the CONDOR database, we investigated whether CNEs and TADs were spatially correlated in the human genome. We looked at different parameters such as absolute and relative distances, overlap of the regions and correlation of the boundaries. In addition, we performed 10,000 simulations to measure the statistical robustness of our analysis. Preliminary results show a strong correlation between the boundaries of CNE clusters and TADs. This indicates that CNES are not randomly distribut ed across the genome but are organized with respect to the TAD architectu re. Furthermore, this reinforces the role of CNES as potential cis regulatory modules of genes.",2016
26093,"A complex genetic diagnosis of a 2 year old girl with growth delay, conge nital renal anomalies, and developmental delay was revealed by combined a CGH and FISH studies. The reported girl was born single to healthy non consanguineous parents. Methods and results: oligonucleotide based microarray analysis was per formed on genomic DNA (KaryoArrayÃÂ®, Bluegnome, Illumina). A mosaicism of a 8,84 Mb terminal deletion on 10q26 and a 511 Kb terminal duplication on 18q initially suggested an unbalanced derivative chromosome 10. Sub telomeric 10q (Vysis) and subtelomeric 18q (Kreatech) FISH probes were applied to establish mosaicism degree, resulting in a major cell line (171 metaphases) with the derivative chromosome 10 (one signal for subtelome ric 10q region and three signals for subtelomeric 18q region) and a minor one (8 metaphases) with the derivative chromosome 18 (three signals for subtelomeric 10q region and one signal subtelomeric for 18q region). No metaphases with the balanced translocation was detected. ParentsÃÂ´ karyo type and FISH studies were normal. Conclusions: The mosaicism observed by a CGH is the result of the dosage compensation between the two chromosome derivative. The FISH thecni ques are essential for the full characterization of genomic rearrangements.

ESHG. ORG 305Back to index questioned. Materials and Methods: We propose an innovative, systematic reanalysis of all described PT21 cases (from 1973 to 2015). In particular, we build an integrated, comparative map from 126 cases with or without DS fulfilling stringent cytogenetic and clinical criteria. The map allowed to define or ex clude as candidates for DS fine Hsa21 sequence intervals, also integrating duplication copy number variants (CNVs) data. Results: A highly restricted DSCR (HR DSCR) of only 34 kb on distal 21q22.13 has been identified as the minimal region whose duplication is shared by all DS subjects and is absent in all non DS subjects. Also being spared by any duplication CNV in healthy subjects, HR DSCR represents a strong candi date for the typical DS features, the intellectual disability and some facial phenotypes. HR DSCR contains no known gene and has homology only to the chimpanzee genome. Conclusion: Our results strongly support the view that a single main critical region for DS actually exists, that it appears to be much smaller than previously suspected and that it could contain currently undescribed genes whose identification should become a priority for under standing the fundamental genotype phenotype relationships in DS and in searching for highly relevant targets for a cure of DS.",2016

Attacks lasted three days and biological inflammation was documented with elevated C reactive protein. Her father is Armenian and her mother Malaga sy, and both are asymptomatic. We identified a well known severe mutation: p. Met694Val, and a controver sial variant: p. Glu148Gln. Parental testing confirmed that the variants were non allelic. Sanger sequencing displayed unbalanced ratio of the mutated and wild type alleles. Mosaicism was excluded because all polymorphisms were found at the same 1:2 ratio. DNA contamination was ruled out through microsatellite analysis. We thus suspected a gene micro rearrangement. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and deep sequencing revealed a he terozygous duplication of the entire wild MEFV gene inherited from the mo ther. Two close surrounding genes (NAA60 and OR1F1) were not duplicated demonstrating that this rearrangement was confined to the MEFV region. We report here the first MEFV duplication in a FMF patient who subsequent ly expressed 1/3 dose of p. Met694Val. Interestingly, the Ã¢ÂÂdilutionÃ¢ÂÂof the pa thological variants did not moderate the patientÃ¢ÂÂs phenotype.",2016

However, even if high throughput DNA sequencing has greatly improved the detection of nucleoti de changes, the biological interpretation of most variants remains challen ging. Here, we report the development and outcome of minigene assays allowing the identification of splicing mutations in any gene of interest. We analyzed in this system more than 600 variants identified in genes implica ted in Lynch syndrome or in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndro me, notably MLH1, MSH2, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Patient RNA was also analy zed when available. Our results indicate that more than 25% of variants of unknown significance in these genes have an impact on RNA splicing, an information that contributed to the clinical classification of several of these variants. Moreover, our targeted studies on Ã¢ÂÂmodel exonsÃ¢ÂÂ, including MLH1 exon 10 and BRCA2 exon 7, revealed an unexpected large number of vari ants altering potential exonic splicing regulatory elements (ESR), an effect that could not be predicted by commonly used bioinformatics approaches. We then evaluated the predictive power of three newly developed ESR dedi cated algorithms. Our results pinpointed the good sensibility and specificity of two of these methods both at identifying ESR mutations and at predicting their severity. This study highlights the potential of in silico approaches as filtering tools for prioritizing variants for functional analyses, a strategy that may help identifying pathogenic variants among the plethora of nucleotide changes detected by exome sequencing. Our findings have implications for all genetic disorders.",2016
26097,"Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin is a condition characterized by persistent ÃÂ³ globin gene expression and synthesis of high levels of fetal he moglobin (HbF; ÃÂ±2ÃÂ³2) during adult life. It is usually caused by promoter va riants affecting the human fetal globin genes (HBG1 and HBG2). Some of the se variants, such as HBG2: g. 158C>T , exert their effect only under conditi ons of erythropoietic stress, typical for ÃÂ² thalassemia patients. We analyzed a previously reported deletion residing in the promoter region of the HBG1 gene (HBG1: g. 225_ 222delAGCA), both in normal conditions and under conditions of erythropoietic stress. Our results indicate that this deletion is responsible for decreased HBG1 gene expression. Specifically, this deleti on was shown to result in drastically reduced reporter gene expression in K562 cells, compared to the wild type sequence but only under conditions of erythropoietic stress, mimicked by introduction of erythropoietin into the cell culture. Also, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed that the HBG1: g. 225_ 222delAGCA deletion creates additional transcriptional fac torsÃ¢ÂÂ binding sites, which, we propose, bind a transcriptional repressor, thus decreasing the HBG1 gene promoter activity.

26098,"Introduction: Hypotrichosis simplex (HS) is a genetically heterogeneous hair loss disorder characterized by progressive hair loss. Mutations in more than 10 genes have been identified for HS, including the LPAR6 gene enco ding for the human lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6). This protein belongs to the same signaling network of lipase H (LIPH), which is also a causative gene for HS. Considering the importance of this pathway in the de termination of proper hair growth, we speculated that more genes related to the same pathway could be a cause of HS. Therefore, our goal was to identify new interactors of LPAR6. Materials and methods: Membrane yeast two hybrid (MYTH) assay and bait dependency test were performed to spot putative binding partners (BPs) of this receptor. The results revealed 72 putative interactors from the skin/hair follicle library. The last step was to further assess the interaction by per forming pull down assay, to discard false positive results and, at the same time, confirm the interaction between LPAR6 and the candidate proteins. Results: Using this methodology, five true BPs have already been confirmed, including the U11/U12 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 35 kDa protein (SNRNP35), the 40S ribosomal protein S28 (RPS28), the emopamil binding protein (EBP), the transcription factor AP 1 (JUN) and the lymphocyte anti gen 6 complex locus D (LY6D).Conclusions: We were able to identify some of the BPs of LPAR6.

26099,"Introduction: Aneuploidy can lead to changes in epigenetic landscape and, vice versa, epigenetic errors can cause aneuploidy. In this study, a relation ship between the level of DNA methylation and aneuploidy was analyzed in human cells during pre and postnatal stages of ontogenesis. Materials and Methods: Retrotransposon LINE 1 methylation was assessed by pyrosequencing in extraembryonic mesoderm and trophoblast of 17 full and 35 mosaic trisomic miscarriages, 21 induced abortions and lymphocy tes of 24 healthy individuals. Spontaneous chromosome loss rate (SCLR) was analyzed in vitro by micronucleus test with FISH in extraembryonic fibroblasts and adult lymphocytes. Results: LINE 1 methylation index was similar among pure trisomics (most ly of meiotic origin) and induced abortions (50 53%), but it was higher (55 56%, p,0.003) in miscarriages with mosaicism. Perhaps, this result from incomplete epigenetic genome reprogramming at preimplantation stage and may be accompanied by hypermethylation of checkpoint genes leading to aneuploidy. In adult lymphocytes, significantly higher LINE 1 methylation index (75%) was observed. SCLR did not differ significantly between groups of embryos with different LINE 1 methylation index. However, SCLR was lower in adult lymphocytes (2.6ÃÂ±1.3Ã¢ÂÂ°) than in fibroblasts of trisomic (5.5ÃÂ±5.8Ã¢ÂÂ°, p,0.03) and indu ced (3.7ÃÂ±3.0Ã¢ÂÂ°, p,0.09) abortions. One can suggest that this results from centromere conformation abnormalities due to genome hypomethylation in extraembryonic tissues. Conclusions: LINE 1 hypomethylation in extraembryonic mesoderm is asso ciated with mitotic SCLR in comrapison with adult lymphocytes. In contrast, LINE 1 hypermethylation can lead to mosaicism in early embryo develop ment.

26100,"Male pattern baldness (MPB) is characterised by an androgen dependent loss of hair from the frontal and vertex area of the scalp which does not affect hair follicles (HFs) of the occipital scalp area. So far, the biological mechanisms that underlie these paradox differences in androgen sensiti vity between HF subpopulations remain elusive. As microRNAs have been demonstrated to be differentially expressed in androgen dependent vs. androgen independent tissues and have already been implicated in hair biology, we hypothesised, that microRNAs may contribute to the differences in androgen sensitivity between HF subpopulations during MPB pathoge nesis. We therefore performed microRNA profiling and differential expres sion analysis in HFs from the frontal and occipital scalp of 25 healthy male donors. A total of 42 microRNAs showed significant differences in gene ex pression between frontal and occipital HFs. To identify potential target ge nes and biological pathways of theses microRNAs, we searched miRWalk2.0 for validated and predicted target genes. Expression of 104 validated and 956 predicted target genes in human HF was confirmed using an in house data set on HF mRNA expression. The subsequent Ingenuity pathway based analysis revealed an enrichment of HF expressed target genes in mTOR and AKT signalling, which have been implicated in cell proliferation and HF homeostasis and androgen and IL 1 signalling, the latter being described to influence androgen regulated gene expression in dermal papilla cells. In summary, our data render a role of microRNAs in MPB development via the control of HF sensitivity to androgens likely. Additional studies are now warranted to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms and to evaluate mi croRNAs as potential new drug targets for MPB therapy.

While missense mutations in MED13L have early been associated with the cyanotic form of non syndromic congenital heart diseases including dextro looped transposition of the great arteries (MIM#608880), a MED13L haplo insufficiency syndrome has recently been described in two patients with moderate ID, conotruncal heart defects, facial abnormalities and hypotonia (Asadollahi et al. 2013). Ten further patients with severe syndromic ID, de lay in motor and speech development but without cardiac phenotypes have been reported, mainly associated with dosage changes(van Healst et al., 2015, Adegbola et al. 2015). One report exists about a ho mozygous missense variant in MED13L in a patient with mild ID (Najmabadi et al. 2011). Here we present the phenotype of a one year old girl with coarctation of the aorta, profound developmental delay, epilepsy, hearing impairment and with additional dysmorphisms that fit into the syndromic spectrum found in patients with MED13L haploinsufficiency. Whole exome sequencing and molecular karyotyping revealed a novel de novo heterozygous missense mutation in MED13L as the likely cause of the condition in this girl. The accumulation of clinical signs and symptoms, dysmorphisms as well as the severity of the profound developmental delay rises the hypothesis that the novel missense mutation in MED13L in this girl could exert a dominant negative effect.",2016
26102,"Introduction: Cells of females contain two copies of the X chromosome. To avoid high expression of X linked genes, due to gene dosage effects, one of the X chromosomes are silenced by a mechanism called X inactivation. This mechanism is associated with specific histone modifications and hyperme thylation along the inactivated chromosome. However, a number of genes escape silencing by an unknown mechanism. In this study we utilize epi genome wide DNA methylation data to identify genes that escape X inacti vation and to contrast our findings with available public DNA methylation datasets from different tissues. Methods: The study included 732 participants (389 female and 341 male). DNA methylation in blood samples was assayed using the Infinium Human methylation450 BeadChip which includes 11232 probes on the X chromo some. Escape from X inactivation was defined as probes with an average methylation below 15% in both males and females; and non overlapping methylation ranges. Results: A total of, 579 CpG probes associated with 160 unique genes dis played DNA methylation patterns that were consistent with X inactivation escape. This pattern was particularly enriched on the short arm of chromo some X, which is consistent with previous publications. The X chromosome contains 827 genes and escape from X inactivation was detected for appro ximately 19% of these genes. Conclusion: DNA methylation data can be utilized to identify and study regi ons of the X chromosome that escape inactivation. Further studies may re veal how X inactivation and escape is related to complex traits and diseases, as well as X inactivation dynamics related to age.",2016
26103,"Menkes disease (MD) is caused by mutations in ATP7A , encoding a copper transporting P type ATPase. Missense mutations have been widely used to identify functionally important amino acid residues, but it is necessary to be cautious. By investigation the molecular effect of 36 ATP7A missense mu tations identified in phenotypic different MD patients, we found that 7 out of the 36 ATP7A missense mutations affect splicing, leading to absence of protein product due to nonsense mediated decay of the ATP7A transcript or to truncated forms of the ATPase due to exon skipping. Three of the mu tations affects nucleotides located at the 3ÃÂ´end of exon 10, 12 and 15 re spectively and lead to skipping of exon 10, 12 and 15 probably as a result of poor 3ÃÂ´donor splice site recognition. Four missense mutations, two located in the middle of exon 8 and two in the middle exon 21 lead to skipping of exon 8 and exon 21 respectively probably due to effects on exonic splicing silencers (ESS) or exonic splicing enhancers (ESE), as these mutations lead to increased ESS/ESE values. The exon skipping lead in some cases to in frame transcript and in other cases to premature termination codon due to frameshift. Normal amount of transcript was observed if the exon skipping preserves the reading frame or if the premature termination codon was lo cated close to the last exon, exon 23.",2016
26104,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) occurs with an incidence of 1 in 3000. In 5% of all patients with NF1, the cause of the disease is a large deletion en compassing the NF1 gene and its flanking regions. The majority of these large NF1 deletions are type 1, encompassing 1.4 Mb with breakpoints lo cated in the low copy repeats NF1 REPa and NF1 REPc which exhibit high sequence homology over a 50 kb region. Previous studies have indicated that non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) constitutes the major mutational mechanism underlying type 1 NF1 deletions. In the present stu dy, we analysed 118 patients with type 1 deletions by MLPA. In 99 (84%) of the 118 deletions, the breakpoints were located within the NAHR hotspots PRS1 and PRS2, separated by 20 kb. However, 19 deletions did not exhibit breakpoints located within PRS1 or PRS2, and the aim of this study was to identify and characterize these breakpoints. To this end, we performed high resolution array CGH and analysed overlapping long range PCR products using paralog specific primers. Our results indicate that many of these type 1 deletions not mediated by NAHR within the known NAHR hotspots exhibit breakpoints close to or within long palindromic sequences capable of for ming hairpin or cruciform structures. These findings imply a novel mutatio nal mechanism, termed palindrome induced NAHR, which is triggered by a secondary structure induced DNA double strand break (DSB). By contrast, type 1 NF1 deletions with breakpoints located within the NAHR hotspots are likely to be regulated by PRDM9 which binds to specific DNA sequence motifs and initiates recombination by recruiting the DSB machinery.",2016

26106,"Recently, mutations in the GATOR1 complex subunit gene NPRL3 were described as new genetic cause for focal epilepsy and cortical dysplasia. NPRL3 together with NPRL2 and DEPDC5 constitute the GATOR1 complex, an important inhibitor of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1(mTORC1). Yet, not much is known about the cellular function of these three GATOR1 proteins. As to mTORC1, it is known that this enzyme com plex plays a key role in cellular energy homeostasis, autophagy, as well as in cell growth and cell cycle pathways. Activation of mTORC1 leads to activati on of two important translation regulatory enzymes, 4 EPB and S6K. So far, no functional study has been conducted to investigate the mecha nisms underlying NPRL3 mutations in focal epilepsy. Therefore, we perfor med in vitro mutagenesis experiments to investigate the impact of NPRL3 mutations published by us and others on the mTORC1 pathway. The ELISA results indicate that the protein interaction between NPRL3 harboring a mutation and DEPDC5 is not affected. Our western blot analyses revealed phosphorylated 4 EPB and S6K, even under amino acid deprivation con dition, indicating loss of function of the mTORC1 inhibitor GATOR1 due to mutated NPRL3. These results indicate that mutations in NPRL3 lead to loss of mTORC1inhibition. It is therefore likely that NPRL3 is essential for a func tional GATOR1 complex.",2016

Partial trisomy of the distal segment can come from intrachromoso mal or interchromosomal rearragements in parental karyotypes or de novo formation. Determination of the unidentified extra material is usually per formed by array analyses. Until recently, a few 14q duplication cases were reported. Most common clinical features are low birth weight, intellectual disability, hypotonia, microcephaly, dysmorphia, respiration failure, hyper telorism. However, no specific critical genes in this region are known yet. Reporting patients with similar aberrant chromosomes 14 will be helpful in order to characterize typical clinical genotype phenotype correlation.

Our goal was to gain new insights into the consequences of OCRL exonic mutations on pre mRNA splicing. Thirteen missense mutations and one synonymous mutation located main ly in poorly defined exons and potentially affecting splicing regulatory ele ments or splice sites were selected. Their effects on splicing were studied using bioinformatics tools and a minigene assay. Specific mutations were introduced by site directed mutagenesis, and the RNA was analysed by RT PCR and DNA sequencing. We found that three presumed missense mutations caused alterations in pre mRNA splicing. Mutation p.

However, it is known that a large fraction of exonic mutations can alter pre mRNA splicing. In this study, we tested presumed missense mutations in these genes for their effects on splicing. Bioinformatics tools were used to select mutations with potential effect on splicing. Variants were experimentally tested using minigene assays. Speci fic mutations were generated by site directed mutagenesis. RNA from cultu red cells was analyzed by RT PCR and automatic DNA sequencing. Seven CLDN16 mutations; p. L145P , p. R149Q, p.

26111,"Spermatocytic tumour (SpT) is a rare testicular tumour that is clinically di stinct from the common classical seminoma. With a median age of onset ~55y, it is the only germ cell tumour of postnatal origin and thus represents a useful model to study human germ cell biology and the characteristics of germline mutations. We performed whole genome sequencing on 4 SpTs (52x coverage) and matched normal tissue (26x). The tumours exhibit ex tensive aneuploidy (50 99 autosomes/tumour) unusually involving whole chromosomes, with relative gains of chr9 and chr20 common to all tumours. Genome wide, the acquired single nucleotide variant (SNV) load was extre mely low for these adult onset tumours (~0.2 per Mb). An average of 6 (2 9) non synonymous variants were called per tumour; no SNVs were shared across tumours and no known oncogenic drivers were identified. Strikingly, in all cases, mutant allelic ratios were low (<50%) and inversely correlated with chromosomal copy number, suggesting that they represent secondary passenger mutations. Two thirds of SNVs were transitions, with C>T ac counting for 51% of all SNVs, most commonly occurring at CpGs; a bias to specific trinucleotide contexts was observed. This mutational signature, which is distinct from other germ cell tumours, is typical of that observed for de novo germline mutations. We propose that in this unique tissue, gene imbalance caused by chromosomal aneuploidy is the oncogenic mechanism driving tumourigenesis and results in spermatogoniaÃ¢ÂÂs re entry into mitosis following failure to complete meiotic divisions.

When co transfection of both wildtype and mutant minigenes was performed, a dominant negative effect on the spli cing was observed. Exon 4 is in frame and its skipping lead to a truncated protein which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as shown by confo cal microscopy. These results indicated that the mutation p.

The mo ther was treated with thyroid hormone and hydroxychloroquine during the pregnancy. A C section was performed for fetal distress at 38 weeks, with birth weight 2580 g, length 49 cm. She presents postaxial polysyndactyly on the left foot, anteriorly placed anus and a sacral dimple. Abdominal USS detected a bicornuate uterus. At age 12 months a mild developmental delay was noted. Her overall growth remains between 3rd and 10th centiles. Results: Standard karyotype: 46,X,der(X)t(X;13)(p11;q12.1)Chromosome microarray: 13q12.3 q34 duplication (84 Mb) and Xp22.33 Xp11.23 deletion (46 Mb)X inactivation studies showed a markedly skewed inactivation pattern. Parental karyotypes were normal. Conclusions: The mild clinical phenotype of partial trisomy 13 together with the skewed X inactivation pattern in blood suggests that the derivative X chromosome carrying a large segment of chromosome 13 is preferentially inactivated in most tissues. Mild features of partial Xp monosomy are to be expected as the deletion affects PAR. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a child with almost complete trisomy 13 originated by a de novo X;13 translocation.",2016
26116,"Introduction: We identified a boy with developmental delay, diplegia and lobar holoprosencephaly (HPE). Karyotyping revealed an apparently balan ced reciprocal de novo chromosomal translocation t(10;12)(q24;p13). Ge nome wide array analysis (Affymetrix Cytoscan HD) and exome sequencing did not detect any pathogenic variants. Materials and Methods. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) using Illumina TruSeq (insert size of 350 bp) on a HiSeqX (paired end and 150bp read length). To identify breakpoints we utilized BreakDancerMax, a Perl/C ++ package that provides genome wide detection of structural vari ants. Anomalously aligned reads at chromosome 10q24 and chromosome 12p13 were visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and confir med by Sanger sequencing. Results. At the breakpoint on the chromosome 10 derivative, we identified a deletion of 7 bp and an insertion of 20 bp of unknown origin. Likewise, at the breakpoint on the chromosome 12 derivative, we identified a dele tion of 31 bp followed by an insertion of 14 bp of unknown origin. Both breakpoints are situated in intergenic regions, specifically between the ge nes FBXW4 and FGF8 on chromosome 10q24 and between EFCAB4B and PARP11 on chromosome 12p13. According to Decipher database, insertion and deletions spanning both breakpoint regions are associated with intel lectual disability and macro/microcephaly. Furthermore, variants in FGF8 have been reported in autosomal recessive HPE. Conclusions. Traditional methods to determine translocation breakpoints, such as FISH, Southern blot or long range PCR, are laborious and with limi ted resolution. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of WGS for the precise identification of translocation breakpoints in non coding regions.",2016
26117,"We demonstrated isodisomy for chromosome 1 in two unrelated sub jects from non consanguineous parents, affected by autosomal recessive syndromes associated with two genes on chromosome 1, type 2 nephro tic syndrome (#600995) and campodactyly arthropathy coxa vara pe ricarditis (#208250). We detected an homozygous mutation in NPHS2 (1q25.2,c.538G>A) in case 1, and in PRG4 (1q31.1,c.2288C>G) in case 2, in herited only by the father. SNP CGH array analysis showed complete homo zygosity for chromosomes 1 in both cases. This finding is in agreement with post zygotic monosomy rescue of the paternal chromosome 1, as a conse quence of maternal non disjunction of chromosomes 1. To exclude recessive conditions for other genes located on chromosome 1, we performed whole exome sequencing. We identified variants in FUCA1, DPYD, ABCA4, NPHP4, PINK1 (case 1) and DDOST , STIL, ATP7B, CFH genes (case 2), considered di sease causative by HGMD and never reported in dbSNP and Exac. A detailed clinical examination in both patients did not shown any signs of the expec ted diseases, excepted for PINK1 that is associated with a late onset disease. Our observations further demonstrate that low penetrance and extensive phenotype heterogeneity occur even for genomic variants reported as cau sative in homozygous state. The analysis of entire exome/genome is a major challenge to geneticists in order to provide genotype phenotype correlati ons, especially in prenatal setting.",2016

We investigated relevant genomic markers that could associated to BloomÃ¢ÂÂs syndrome (BS), a chro mosomal instability disorder caused by mutations in BLM gene. Materials and Methods: We performed a deep sequencing RNA Seq profiling using high throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform) of samples de rived from two patients with BS and three unaffected controls. The raw data analysis was generated using specialized softwares (CASAVA 1.8.2, Bowtie2, EdgeR, Rsubread and DESeq2). Results: The RNA Seq assay revealed the precise location of transcription limits, with resolution of a single nucleoti de and high level of efficiency, showing high genetic complexity. The results disclosed 399 genes differentially expressed : 216 up regulated in the group with Bloom syndrome and 183 up regulated in the control group. Unexpec ted most of them were immune system related genes. Also, we detected lar ge number of SNP and IDELS in one of BS patients, highlighting a frameshift in the BLM gene. Conclusions: Our results suggested that gene expression network in BS could interfere in the regulation of the pathways associated with the immunological systems regulation probably caused by disturbance of DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, the study of the transcriptome using RNA Seq may help to a breakthrough in the pathogenesis of BS.

26119,"Farber disease (FarberÃ¢ÂÂs lipogranulomatosis, ceramidase deficiency), is an autosomal recessive, extremely rare disease caused and characterized by a deficient acid ceramidase activity encoded by ASAH1 gene. Low ceramidase activity is resulting in accumulation of fatty substances, mainly ceramides. At clinical level, Farber disease is manifesting through hallmark symptoms such as: periarticular nodules, lipogranulomas, swollen and painful joints and a hoarse voice or a weak cry; in addition to these, also hepatospleno megaly, rapid neurological deterioration or developmental delay are repor ted [1, 5 6]. Seven different Farber types were described, with phenotypes varying from mild cases with a longer life expectancy to very severe cases, where the patients do not survive past their first year of life. The screening through over 40 different ceramide like molecule show that only C26 is specifically increased in samples from Farber patients. We pre sent here a new method of diagnosis of Farber disease by determining the concentration of C26 ceramide isoforms using LC/MRM MS and C25 cera mide as internal standard. Moreover, we found that cis isomer of the C26 ceramide is a specific biomarker for Farber disease, with pathological va lues in a range of 39.2 150.0 nmol/L blood (normal range 13.6 23.4 nmol/L blood, N,192, healthy individuals). The new biomarker can be determined directly in the dried blood spot extract with low sample consumption, easy sample preparation, high reproducibility and it presents the possibility of to be used in high throughput screenings.",2016
26120,"Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disease with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. MLD is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and is characterized by enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls. However, assay of the ARSA enzyme activity alone is not sufficient for diagnosis; ARSA pseudode ficiency, which is characterized by enzyme activity that is 5~20% of normal controls does not cause MLD. Without this enzyme, sulfatides build up in many tissues of the body, eventually destroying the myelin sheath of the ner vous system with serious consequences manifested in clinical symptoms e.g. weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, convulsions, paralysis, and dementia. A recent study contended sulfatide is not completely responsible for MLD because it is nontoxic. It has been suggested lysosulfatide plays a role because of its cytotoxic properties in vitro. Recently developed enzyme replacement therapy and the steep progression of the disease in ARSA pati ents make the development of HTS diagnosis of high importance. Here we report the development of a new biochemical screening method for ARSA patients using a combination of two techniques: (i.) arylsulphatase enzymatic activity and (ii.) quantification of ARSA specific biomarkers (both lyso sulfatide and selected sulfatides). Both assays are using for the analy sis liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC/MRM MS) and the results were confir med by genetic analysis. This screening method has been validated for dried blood spot (DBS) technology which further simplifies the sample handling, processing and analysis.",2016
26121,"Introduction: Autism can be part of a genetic syndrome associating with dysmorphic features. While there are many studies that described genetic alterations associated with ASD, none have identified facial phenotypes as sociating to ASD with computer aided facial analysis. Here we evaluate the geno/phenotype relation in a limited number of autistic individuals. Methods: An image set of affected individuals divided into two cohorts: pre senting facial dysmorphologies (AFD) (n,20) and without dysmorphology (ANFD) by human experts. These cohorts were compared to unaffected con trols (n,50) using variables and rankings produced by the Facial Dysmor phology Novel Analysis (FDNA) technology. In both ASD cohorts mutations of 103 genes associated to autism, repeat expansions of FMR1 gene, and in some AFD cases chromosomal abnormalities have been identified. Results: Clear trends were recognizable in the three groups along facial dys morphology variables and rankings. Although labeled as not showing facial dysmorphology, the ANFD cohort was automatically ranked separately from the unaffected controls. In addition, two possible clusters of ANFD were re cognized by the technology. The AFD cohort was clearly recognized as sepa rate from the other two cohorts. In the AFD group Fragile X, CHARGE, Silver Russell, Cohen, 2q37.3 microdeletion syndrome, and Speech Language Dis order 1 were identified. Conclusion: The preliminary results show that deep phenotyping provided by a computer aided facial analysis could be instrumental in the early clini cal diagnostic of the syndromic ASD forms and could help in the selection of diagnostic molecular tests. Larger study is needed to assess these trends and to allow cross validation.",2016
26122,"The molecular diagnosis of autoinflammatory diseases includes several can didate genes such as MEFV, MVK, TNFRSF1A , NOD2 and NLPR3 . NGS offers an improvement in time and costs versus Sanger sequencing. We compared two different NGS approaches for molecular diagnosis of these patients. Two different library approaches were followed. In the first, 8 different frag ments MEFV (14.600 kb), MVK (23.576 kb), TNFRSF1A (13.358 kb), NOD2 (35.939 kb) and NLPR3 (31.054 kb) were amplified using Takara LA Taq DNA Polymerase and library preparation was performed using NexteraXT . In the second, a Custom GeneRead DNAseq panel of targeted genes was am plified (197 amplicons with a mean size of 203 bp) and libraries were prepa red with NEBNext Ultra DNA kit. In both approaches, libraries were pooled and sequenced using paired end on the MiSeq platform. Sequencing data were analyzed with the Variant Studio and GeneRead Seq Variant Analysis software, respectively. The validation of the potential pathogenic variants was performed by Sanger sequencing. The Nextera approach requires a high quality of DNA to amplify fragments until 15000 bp. The sequences include the whole intronic regions, but the coverage is very heterogeneous. On the other hand, GeneRead protocol is fast, it predicts the uncovered regions and the coverage is similar and con stant between runs. In both procedures, the detected variants were highly similar and false positives have not been observed. Both approaches are useful in the detection of variants associated with the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases. In our hands, Generead ap pears faster and more reproducible between runs.",2016

Clini cal and genetic heterogeneity in monogenetic disorders represents a major diagnostic challenge. Here, we used the whole exome sequencing as a diagnostic approach for establishing a molecular diagnosis in a family with two children with MCPH. Materials and Methods: Two patients, 11 and 9 years old, born from consan guinous parents, were refered to the department of medical genetics. The diagnosis of MCPH was made, based on reduced head circumference wit hout brain architecture abnormalities. Whole exome sequencing was per ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW.

Gln343Ter in exon 8 of WDR62, a gene already known to be related to MCPH, was identified. Sanger sequencing confirmed this mutation in the affected children. This mutation was not found in HGMD and 1,000 Genome database. Conclusions: Our data expanded the spectrum of mutations in WDR62 gene, and give more arguments of the powerful and cost effective tool of whole exome sequencing for the molecular diagnosis of genetically heterogeneous disorders such MCPH. Exome sequencing allows us to have faster molecular results especially when specific diagnosis needs a longer time to sequence many genes.",2016
26124,"The advent of NGS has opened the possibility to design custom protocols for molecular analysis of several genes in parallel. This approach is particu larly valuable in the diagnosis of diseases with similar phenotype although caused by a heterogeneous molecular basis. Taking advantage of this novel opportunity, we designed and validated a NGS custom panel to simulta neously analyze the 23 essential genes involved in inherited bleeding dis orders. The targeted exon enrichment GeneRead panel (QIAGEN) designed com prises a total of 1,285 amplicons (size average 169 bp) covering the 98.7% of the target genomic regions. Construction of libraries, including patient specific indexation, was performed with NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit. Between 24 and 48 libraries were sequenced together in every MiSeq (Illumina) run. To date, we have been diagnosed in this way more than 250 patients, suffering both frequent and minor coagulopathies. Putative mu tations were identified by GeneRead Variant Calling software and further validated by Sanger methodology, reaching 100% sensitivity. This versati le protocol allows to process together samples from different pathologies, with the consequent simplification of routine procedure and cost reduction. Likewise, it has been especially advantageous when clinical diagnosis was unclear or controversial due to a borderline phenotype with various candi date genes. Importantly, this methodology offers invaluable genetic infor mation of all the variants, polymorphisms and causative mutations, from several hemostatic genes. Analysis and integration of this data could refine the knowledge of genotype phenotype correlation and improve the foreca sting of hemorrhagic risk.

26125,"Background: The most commonly used technique in clinical genetics is PCR. PCR is reasonably time consuming. Most labs perform maximal 4 PCRÃ¢ÂÂs per day (including one overnight). Making PCR faster has been accomplished by introducing faster Peltier based equipment and using faster chemistry. Here we report a novel thermal cycler, which can amplify the complete BRCA1 gene under 10 minutes, reducing the amplification time from 150 minutes to less than 10 minutes. Methods: Amplification is performed in ultra thin wells (<50 micron) in a 96 well microplate format. The PCR machine consists of three temperature zones for denaturation, annealing and extension. Each zone consists of two opposite heated blocks. When the tray enters a temperature zone, the heat ed blocks are brought together, thus squeezing the wells. The reaction mix reaches the desired temperature instantaneously. Results: 29 fragments, covering all the exons of the BRCA1 gene were ampli fied in under 10 minutes, employing 30 cycles over 3 temperatures. Results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Moreover, a 102 basepair fragment was amplified in less than 2 minutes, employing 30 cycles over 3 tempera tures. Discussion and conclusion: This technology introduces a microplate com patible PCR format, which can perform most PCRÃ¢ÂÂs in less than 10 minutes. It will allow laboratories to change their logistics (a machine is always avail able shortly), increase their throughput or speed up their process. With this technology one machine comfortably performs over 40 PCRÃ¢ÂÂs in an 8 hour working day.",2016
26126,"Background: In studies of over 1000 patients [1,2] we recently demonstra ted that multigene testing can produce clinically valid results, comparable to traditional tests while expanding patient management impact. Other fin dings included (a) that pathogenicity classifications produced using publi cly available resources under recent guidelines [3] were 99.8% similar to those produced by others using a large proprietary database. Also (b) many pathogenic variants were technically challenging for NGS. Here, we further explore these topics in a substantially larger data set. Methods: De identified panel test results for roughly 20,000 individuals were examined. In addition, data from the ClinVar database, representing another approximately 20,000 patients, were used. Results: Consistent with our prior results, about 4 5% of patients harbor mutations in genes other than BRCA1/2. Most of these findings are con sistent with the patientÃ¢ÂÂs personal/family history and are not incidental. About 10% of these mutations are of types known to be challenging for NGS (e.g. single exon CNVs, large indels, complex events, etc.). These require spe cialised algorithms or NGS biochemistries to accurately report. Considering BRCA1/2 variants, interpretations are highly concordant (98.5%) between established diagnostic labs in terms of clinical manage ment impact. Moreover all of the discordances are in rare variants that ap pear in few patients. Thus, 99.8% of patients are expected to be concordant, as we observed previously. Conclusions: When using appropriate NGS and variant interpretation me thods, validity and utility of panels tests can be established.1. Desmond, JAMAOncology 20152. Lincoln, JMolDiag 20153.

26127,"Introduction: Early detection is key for increasing survival in cancer pati ents but it is limited by the sensitivity of current detection methods. In this context, cell free DNA (cfDNA), currently used as a non invasive tool for aneuploidy detection in prenatal screening and graft rejection monitoring, promises to improve early cancer detection. Because cfDNA levels in blood are very low, sample preparation must be optimized. Here we set up a work flow for generating high quality libraries from low cfDNA inputs that can be sequenced using next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. Materials and methods: Blood samples from healthy individuals, pregnant women and cancer patients were collected in Streck tubes to avoid genomic DNA contamination from white blood cells. Plasma was separated by centri fugation prior to cfDNA extraction. Multiple cfDNA extraction methods were tested. Library construction was optimized for low cfDNA inputs and samp les were analyzed by qPCR and targeted NGS. Results: Bead and column based methods produced similar yields (2.5 10 ng/mL) but the bead based methods were preferred for being faster and not requiring the addition of carrier molecules. Using this workflow we were able to detect fetal cfDNA by qPCR, and to successfully sequence libraries constructed from 1ng input DNA. Conclusions: We have set up a workflow that allows the analysis of limiting amounts of cfDNA through NGS, which can be applied to the detection of biomarkers present in cfDNA in samples from multiple biological origins, including cancer.",2016

The availability of genome wide screening technologies shifted the paradigm from few) gene investigation strategies to a multi genes / complete genome analysis. Nevertheless, clinical application are often still focused on the analysis of specific target regions. As a result, a new trend is emerging that exploits the genome scale approach by Ã¢ÂÂse quencing everythingÃ¢ÂÂ, but analyzing only the regions of interest of specific diagnostic cases (e.g., diseases). As a consequence, sequencing data that is available, but has not been analyzed, will be reused in the future to answer different questions over time. Moreover, an increasing need for decision support in routine diagnostics with multiple applications will be noticed. Methods: Following this trend, Platomics proposes an analogue approach to software solutions designed for genetic data analysis. The computational approach can be summarized as: one specific software app for each diagno stic use case. This also marks a paradigmatic shift in software development, as it is focused on atomic validated reproducible applications rather than omni comprehensive highly configurable solutions. Therefore, each appli cation needs to be in line with the specific genetic screening requirements, in terms of ethics, benefits for the patient, and effects on health care costs. Conclusions: Genetic test manufacturers will be enabled to bring their new products faster to the market and lowering the barrier to entry by shorte ning the time to market path.

26129,"Background: Our goal was to evaluate localized genetic relatedness in cli nically relevant regions. We focused on DNA surrounding genes related to Cystic Fibrosis, Sickle Cell Anemia, and Smith Lemli Opitz Syndrome. Methods: We created three cohorts by selecting carriers of the disorders and adding randomized control patients (non carriers) of the same ethni city. To study the relatedness of each group, we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region of the genes implicated in each disease. We created genetic similarity matrices for each cohort using six SNP based measures of relatedness. We compared average relatedness within the case groups, within the control groups, and between the two groups. This led to development of an initial carrier risk classifier for Cystic Fibrosis mutation DeltaF508, which modifies the k Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to use our SNP based relatedness measure instead of Euclidean distance. We te sted the performance of our classifier using repeated random sub sampling cross validation. Results: Carriers of all 3 disorders appeared more similar to each other than to controls. We found that inter group relatedness between sets of patients that are carriers of different mutations for the same disease varied wide ly. Using the modified KNN classifier, we randomly sub sampled our cohort into training and testing sets, and found 98% of cases get classified as at risk compared to 20% of controls. Conclusion: These results indicate it may be feasible to classify carrier risk when direct observation of a mutation is not possible. This may be useful for improving sensitivity where direct testing is difficult or error prone.",2016

Introduction: Cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma is used for fetal sexing, NIPT and Rhesus genotyping. cfDNA also holds promise in detecting acquired so matic changes in cancer. We used a new technique, Northern Lights Assay (NLA), to further investigate structure of cfDNA in body fluids in healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: NLA is based on Two Dimensional Strandness De pendent Electrophoresis (2D SDE), a technique of nucleic acid separation based on size, standness, and conformation changes induced by damage. Each specimen is analyzed in sample pairs of non digested DNA to detect single and double stranded breaks and MboI digested DNA to detect va rious other lesions. NLA is run in microgel to improve sensitivity. We tested NLA on cfDNA isolated with gentle methods from whole blood, plasma, sa liva, urine sediment and cell free urine in healthy controls (7 males and 13 females) age 21 to 80. Results: Yield from from clinical volume samples was sufficient for sensitive analysis with NLA. Variable but generally extensive damage was detected in cfDNA from various body fluids. cfDNA in plasma ranged from essentially at least 3 kb long fragments only to a substantial fraction comprising apoptosis DNA fragments. Conclusions: The findings have implications for cfDNA assays. Consistent differences in rates of apoptosis in healthy subjects seem unlikely. A more plausible explanation is time coordinated pulse release of cfDNA fragments from apoptotic cells. This pulse would have previously gone undetected using protein markers of cell death with half life of hours in plasma instead of minutes for cfDNA.",2016

This may have applications in both early diagnostics, as well as the rapeutic monitoring of alterations predictive for drug response. Objectives, materials, methods: Our primary objective was to set up a straightforward platform for the analysis of clinically relevant mutations.

The cohort will be longitudinally monitored and repeated blood samples collected upon progression. FFPE tumor samples have been available for approximately 50% of the study subjects.

The methods will be compared in both cfDNA and FFPE analysis, as well as with the available clinical DNA data. Perspectives: Our further aim is to collect longitudinal samples and perform a larger screen of drug susceptibility and resistance mutations in our study cohort, involving detection of point mutations, copy number analyses and DNA methylation changes.

26132,"Identification of circulating tumour DNA in a blood sample (liquid biopsy) can be used to detect and genetically profile tumours in a routine and mi nimally invasive assay. As certain somatic mutations are specifically asso ciated with cancer, liquid biopsy has the potential to be an exceptionally specific and low risk screening tool that could stage shift cancer detection to earlier, more curable stages. We present two complementary methods to optimize sensitivity over broad gene regions at low cost. We combine a highly selective enrichment tech nology to screen hotspot mutations at very high sensitivity, with a high ac curacy sequencing technology that can scan large regions of the genome at low cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. Using the commercially available OnTarget enrichment technology, activating mutations consisting of SNVs and short indels can be preferentially selected for sequencing over wild type sequence. This approach enables highly sensitive detection to 0.01%, or below, for up to 1,000 unique variants. Broader coverage of regions without hotspot mutations, as well as detec tion of copy number variants and translocations, can then be addressed with a novel library construction process for NGS sequencing that increases the accuracy of the workflow by an order of magnitude.

26134,"Introduction: About 13% of genes in the human genome have variation in copy number. Copy number alterations (CNAs), somatic changes to chromo some structure that result in gain or loss in copies of sections of DNA, are very common in cancer and associated with particular cancer types. Materials and Methods: Ratios of reference and copy number variants were maintained by limiting quantities of dNTPs and allowing PCR to plateau. Suitable fragments having single melting domains, well separated Tms, and no common homologs were designed using uMelt melting curve prediction software. MeltWizard 6 software was used to remove background, equalize negative derivative melting peaks corresponding to the reference segment, and identify and quantify samples with different CNV ratios from the ampli tude of their target melting peaks. Results: CNV ratios far beyond this range, as small as 2: 2.125 (5.88%), were detectable using the most robust, simplest, and highest resolution method of limiting dNTPs at an optimal 3.25 uM.

Based on the normalized data, for each target the ratio of the normalized average read depth of the sample to that of the controls and a distribution analysis using a Z score are calculated. Based on the calculated ratio and distributions a prediction is made for each target to determine whether a CNV is present or not, providing additional sample quality metrics during several stages of the analysis. We compared the performance of CoNVaDING with XHMM and CoNIFER in 320 samples captured with two different targeted gene panels containing in total 308,574 exons. For all CNV calls made by one of the three methods MLPA was performed. CoNVaDING detected all known CNVs in high quality targets, giving 100% sensitivity, at a 99.998% specificity. Thereby outper forming XHMM and CoNIFER by exhibiting a higher sensitivity and speci ficity and by precisely identifying low quality samples and regions. These improved quality control metrics enable use in both research and clinical diagnostics setting.",2016
26136,"Copy number variation (CNV) detection from exon capture NGS data is challenging because of non uniform capture efficiency of targeted exons or short read lengths. Often CNV detection in routine diagnostics is still per formed by additional techniques (MLPA, microarray) instead of using NGS data for both SNV and CNV. We used a bioinformatics pipeline comprised of ExomeDepth, XHMM and in house methods to detect exonic CNVs using read depth data derived from a targeted NGS Panel (Illumina TruSight Can cer). Capture efficiency per exon was assessed with a set of CNV negative patients to identify reliable regions. Additionally, genes with pseudogenes, paraloges and repeat regions were excluded from the study design. We pre sent a first evaluation with a set of 86 patients previously tested for SNVs (NGS) and CNVs (MLPA). 51 patients presented pathogenic SNVs and 35 pa tients pathogenic CNVs. We confirmed 15 deletions and two duplications with high significance. Another nine deletions and two duplications were correctly detected with lower confidence, which affected a smaller number of exons compared to the high confidence results. In addition, five incon spicuous cases showed contradictory results due to SNVs affecting MLPA probe binding site. In two cases deletion events of one exon could not be detected. No additional CNVs were found in patients with pathogenic single mutations. This proof of concept study demonstrates the feasibility of using a single testing strategy to detect simultaneously SNVs and CNVs for clinical diagnosis. However, this method is only applicable for selected genes and consistent workflow conditions.",2016
26137,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common recessive disorder caused by >1,900 mutations in the CFTR gene. Despite extensive screening, 1 5% of patients lack a definite molecular diagnosis. Here, we propose an efficient, sensitive, and cost effective whole gene NGS protocol applied to the mole cular screening of CF patients. Methods: We designed a custom Nimblegen SeqCap EZ capture kit targeting the entire 189 kb long CFTR gene and the coding portions of the SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes, encoding the subunits of the sodium channel ENaC, reported to be mutated in CF like patients. Sequencing was perfor med on an HiSeq2000 platform, multiplexing up to 18 samples in a sequen cing lane. Results: We analyzed 23 CF patients and one carrier: 4 previously characte rized patients served as controls; 17 were lacking a complete diagnosis after conventional CFTR screening; 3 were not previously genetically screened. We obtained a mean depth >1,150X and 98% coverage of the target region. Our approach allowed the identification of 22 previously known CFTR mu tations, including 2 large deletions. For 2 patients, compound heterozygous for a CFTR mutation and the intron 9 c.1210 34TG[11 12]T5 allele asso ciated with decreased CFTR mRNA levels the molecular diagnosis was im plemented by measuring the residual level of wild type transcript by digital RT PCR on RNA extracted from nasal brushing.

Our goal was to get an insight of what choices were made regarding the content of the list with dedicated genes in different laboratories in the Netherlands. A question naire was send out in 2015 to all (n,7) clinical genetic laboratories in the Netherlands after one contact person per laboratory had agreed to partici pate in this study. Six laboratories returned the questionnaire. It contained 10 questions regarding the selection of genes for the default list of intellec tual disability. The process of compiling the list is dissimilar on a quite a number of items; there were discrepancies in both the experts involved as the sources used between the laboratories. In addition, the level of evidence for causality e.g. selection criteria for genes, differed slightly between laboratories. Points of internal discussion included the application of genes present in the heel prick and whether the DMD and TTN gene should be added to the list. The agreements included the frequency of updating the list and the willingness of sharing its content.

To ensure samples submitted into EnglandÃ¢ÂÂs 100,000 Genomes Project are of appropriate quality to enable accurate WGS, NHS England with UK NE QAS for Molecular Genetics have developed an external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for the extraction of high quality genomic DNA from fresh whole blood samples. All laboratories providing DNA samples for inclusion in the project are required to participate in this EQA scheme. Since December 2014, laboratories have participated in three practical EQA runs. In each run, three homogenised donor whole blood samples of varying volumes were provided and laboratories instructed to extract DNA from the whole sample and return it to UK NEQAS for analysis. The quality metrics assessed and scored include DNA sample volume, total DNA mass, 260/280 ratio, Illumina Delta Cq assay, Library Preparation and Bioanalyser trace using the Trusight Cancer Panel and agarose gel electrophoresis.

26141,"Background: Most microarray based CNV detection algorithms infer copy number by comparing a beadÃ¢ÂÂs intensity for a given sample to a control in tensity (called an r ratio). We have developed a novel normalization techni que to improve exon level CNV calling and tested it on the DMD gene. Methods: We used the Illumina Infinium Assay with custom content and designed unique beads to cover the DMD exons and the fifty nucleotides surrounding each exon. We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the r ratio for 2671 beads with low minor allele frequency outside of the DMD gene in an attempt to capture intensity variability due only to technical noise. Copy number was determined by comparing a sampleÃ¢ÂÂs observed r ratio per exon to the r ratio predicted for that exon by a regularized linear regression model trained on the principal components of the outside beads. Results: We ran the algorithms on 1715 female research consented samples, using a null call threshold based on the smoothness of the r ratio values across exons. We observed 733 normal, 976 NC, and 6 CNV calls for the stan dard r ratio algorithm and 1698 normal, 15 NC, and 2 CNV calls for the novel algorithm. Discussion: We validated the two PCA normalized CNV calls using an out side lab. Patterns in the four CNV calls made by the un normalized algorithm indicate false positive calls, but this was not confirmed. This novel technique further normalizes r ratio data by removing non biological noise and can be used to improve exon level copy number detection for screening and dia gnostic microarray assays.",2016

Building on the TaqMan based Rare Mutation assay set for detection of rare mutations using digital PCR on the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System, we are now developing multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of several mutations. We selected relevant mutations in the EGFR and KRAS genes for our initial multiplex application: EGFR G719, EGFR exon 19 deletions, and KRAS G12/G13. These mutations may have implications for potential future targeted therapy. Methods: Primers and probes of singleplex Rare Mutation Assays were re formulated to generate multiplex assays detecting the EGFR and KRAS mu tations. All multiplex assays were tested on template composed of wild type genomic DNA background mixed with mutant plasmid reflecting each of the mutations detected by the multiplex assays. Summary: Initial experimental results were successful and showed excel lent signal intensity and clear cluster separation when analyzed with the QuantStudio 3D AnalysisSuiteÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Cloud Software.

While sequencing technology and variant interpretation are continuously progressing, the critical process of phenotyping and gathering clinical infor mation has not changed much. Here the facial dysmorphology novel analy sis (FDNA) technology was used to automatically identify facial phenotypes associated with Emanuel Syndrome (ES; OMIM 609029) based on 2D facial photos. ES, also denominated supernumerary der(22)t(11;22) syndrome is characterized cytogenetically by a small supernumerary marker chromoso me (sSMC). Clinical signs include severe mental development delay, micro cephaly and dysmorphic features. Besides heart defects, cleft lip and pala te, kidney malformations and anal atresia, etc., can complicate the clinical problems. Here 65 facial photos of molecularly diagnosed ES patients were compared to unaffected controls (n,1000) and to a second control group (n,1000) of individuals affected with one of 100 other syndromes with fa cial phenotypes. The mean area under the curve (AUC) comparison between ES and normal individuals (0.99, STD 0.001) expresses an almost full sepa ration between these two cohorts. A slightly lower mean AUC (0.985, STD 0.046) was obtained when comparing between ES and individuals affected with other syndromes. Our preliminary results show that computer aided facial recognition is able to help in the clinic and could possibly reduce the time patients spent in the diagnostic odyssey. Also it may help to differenti ate ES from other patients with sSMC, especially in countries with no access to more sophisticated genetic approaches apart from banding cytogenetics.

But, could exome be an efficient routine strategy to perform genetic diagnoses? We wanted to ask this question in current convergence of some difficult pathol ogy presentations and an easy access to exome technology. Method: We selected 20 patients affected with greatly heterogeneous ge netic pathologies without any obvious gene causing disease or previous un successful targeted genes analyses. Exome sequencing was done for each of them. We analysed raw data with an in house bioinformatic pipeline Ã¢ÂÂphe notype guidedÃ¢ÂÂ designed (it uses HP terms for the pathology description which fit or not with Human Phenotype Ontology database), the filter used was 1000g database. This pipeline generated a set of sequence variations ac cording to possible mode of inheritance and MIM data. Candidate sequence variations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and family segregations. Results: The first results were encouraging: 11 genes were very likely patho genic (55% of the patients) and 4 others were possibly deleterious (20%).Discussion and conclusions: These first results allow us to continue this as say to confirm or not these promising test performances. Nevertheless, im provements have to be implemented to this strategy to avoid missdetection of sequence variations, like the use of a SNP local database, a bioinformatic splice testing for silencing SNP and exon intron junction nucleotides and an analysis of copy number variations.",2016

At least ten genes are linked to familial MDS/AML, involved in transcription regulation, telomere maintenance and splicing. Our laboratory currently offers Sanger sequencing for RUNX1 for familial platelet disorder with propensity to AML, and familial AML with mutated CEBPA.

Analysis performed on family members allowed us to identify 36 individuals with heterozygous MEFV mutations. Only 53.8% of them presented some clinical manifestations attributable to a mild FMF. Conclusions: Mutations identified by Reverse Dot Blot analysis covered about 90% of the mutations, as well as that identified by Sanger sequencing. According to the literature, a significant subset of person with FMF (25%) have a heterozygous MEFV pathogenic variant, then the sequencing detec tion rate of cases not diagnosable by Reverse Dot Blot drops to 67.5%.The reason may be due to:1) Mutation in another gene;2) Overlapping manifestations with other autoinflammatory diseases that make difficult differential diagnosis. In literature, rare mutations in other genes have been reported in patients carrying only a heterozygous mutation in MEFV gene. In heterozygous patients, we consider most useful to perform a six month trial of colchicine therapy to confirm the diagnosis of FMF and, if no benefit, to analyse other genes responsible for autoinflammatory disease in diffe rential diagnosis with FMF.

26149,"Although whole exome sequencing (WES) is increasingly applied in clinical genetics, it is mostly used to replace the gene by gene sequencing paradigm that we were used to. However, several studies have shown that the possible applications of WES stretch beyond clinical genetics: in other clinical situati ons, particularly in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), an unbiased tool to make a diagnosis can be extremely useful. Several hurdles, such as proven soundness and cost efficacy, need to be ta ken before a test can be implemented in a routine clinical setting. To our opinion the long turnaround time for WES has been the major barrier. The full standard WES procedure sometimes takes over six months in diagnostic labs. We managed to reduce the waiting period from several months to one week through developing a protocol that combines AgilentÃ¢ÂÂs SureSelectXT workflow with rapid Illumina NextSeq sequencing.

26154,"Introduction: Huntington disease (HD) is an extremely variable inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an unstable expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT ). The traditional method of diagnosis is limited due to the assumption that the length of the fragment is equal to the repeat number. This may not always be true because there is a variable CCG repeat downstream of the CAGs and also atypical intervening sequences. Moreover, the traditional approaches cannot measure somatic mosaicism of the expanded CAG repeat, or detect variants within or flanking the repeats. We have used Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to quantify germline and somatic variants in the HD allele. Materials and Methods: The HD CAG and CCG repeats were amplified from genomic DNA using locus specific primers combined with barcoded Illumi na adapters. The PCR products were sequenced using the MiSeq platform and genotyped by alignment of reads against custom reference sequences. Results and Discussion: We used the MiSeq platform to sequence and ge notype HD alleles and the adjacent CCG repeats from more than 490 DNA samples from both HD patients and unaffected individuals. Our data have revealed three atypical allele structures represented in 56 alleles. However, it must be noted that no atypical haplotypes were detected in intermediate or expanded alleles. We observed the degree of somatic mosaicism for pa tients with HD is correlated with CAG repeat size and age at sampling. NGS is promising diagnostic tool for genotyping HD and potentially replacing existing methods. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 320Back to index",2016

However, the extensive use of predic tion tools should be accompanied of criteria that allow for general and good practice recommendations to interpret the numerical results in context of clinical suspicion of the patient.

Exome sequencing of inflammation rela ted genes was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq4000. SNPs and indels were compared between families with low and high expression profiles. Variants in genes coding for proteins which physically interact, carry out similar/overlapping functions and which participate in the same biological pathway were analysed per family. Results: Patterns of TLR and inflammatory expression profiles tended to be similar in members of the same family. First degree relatives share a consi derable number of variants in inflammation related genes, while very few differences were observed between families with low and high inflammato ry expression profiles. While an accumulation of variants were identified in some TLRs, IRAK and MAPK genes, fewer or no variants were observed in molecules having a more critical role in the TLR signaling pathway including MyD88, and transcription factors. Conclusions: The similar pattern of inflammatory expression profiles in fa milies is possibly due to the presence of inherited factors. Genetic variation influences the fine tuning of the inflammatory response, where the overall effect on a pathway is an accumulation of the effects of the variants within that pathway.",2016
26157,"Introduction: A child with clinical osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) was referred to genetic testing. Recessive inheritance was presumed. Previous genetic te sting of COL1A1 and COL1A2 was negative. Materials and MethodsExome sequencing was performed and variants were called in all known OI genes. Results: At first, no obvious causative variants were found. However, a ho mozygote variant in LEPRE1 caught our attention. It had a high allele fre quency in ESP (92.44%), but no entries in 1000G nor ExAC. Because of the big difference in allele frequencies, ESP was contacted. They confirmed the allele frequency, but regarded it as a sequencing artifact. The variant was a frameshift deletion in the last exon of LEPRE1 and had not been detected in our lab previously. The variant passed all quality criteria and was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. LEPRE1 encodes prolyl 3 hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) which belongs to a family of collagen prolyl hydroxylases required for proper collagen biosynthesis, folding, and assembly. The variant changes the reading frame for the last 18 amino acids and elongates the protein by 10 amino acids. This region harbors a KDEL sequence which retains P3H1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. P3H1 will probably not be able to retain its function when this sequence is altered, Conclusion: This sequence variant is the probable cause of OI in this patient. Caution must be taken when filtering sequence variants where there is big discrepancy between reported allele frequencies.",2016
26158,"Leukodystrophies and Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurode generative diseases manifesting frequently with similar clinical pictures, i.e. chronic progressive spasticity, due to common underlying causes and physiopathological mechanisms. Although the genetic basis is partly under stood, only a small fraction of cases receives a definitive genetic diagnosis using targeted approaches nowadays. Whole exome sequencing (WES) may improve diagnostic yield and identify novel causative genes. To analyze the derived data, we have developed a global, network based computational method designed to prioritize disease genes based on the observation that genes causing similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a network of protein protein interactions. This information is integrated with a pheno typic disease metric based on Human Phenotype Ontologies (HPO), to score the strength of association of proteins with leukodystrophy and HSP phe notypes. Our diagnostic yield from 41 cases analyzed by WES is as follows: i) Positive diagnosis in 17 cases (pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants); ii) Possible diagnosis in seven cases with variants of unknown significance, of which four are non previously related to HSP or leukodystrophies; iii) Three novel candidate genes; iv) 14 Inconclusive cases. Our analysis links HSP and leukodystrophy to other neurodegenerative disorders and may facilitate gene discovery and mechanistic understanding of white matter and cortical motor neuron diseases.

Results: 368 patients were investigated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) functional analyses of which 92 patients (25 %) were considered to have an MMR deficient tumor. Compared to CFDRs with normal MMR function, CFDRs with MMR defici ency had significantly larger numbers of LS tumors as well as lower LAD. A total of 114 patients were subjected to MMR gene mutation screening of which 92 had an MMR deficient tumor, 10 had a MMR proficient tumor, the remaining 12 having unknown MMR function. Among mutation screened patients, 48 (42 %; i.e. 13 % of the entire cohort) had an LS associated mutation. Mutations were found in MSH2 (46 %), followed by MLH1 (31 %), MSH6 (21 %) and PMS2 (2 %). Total laboratory costs were 248 482 Ã¢ÂÂ¬.

Innumerable combinations of genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors could explain the causes of male infertility. Recent studies have shown that mutations or polymorphisms in new candidate genes are responsible for the majority of idiopathic forms of spermatogenic failure. Given the recent evolution in the development of Next Generation Sequen cing techniques and the growing number of known and candidate genes we designed and developed a targeted sequencing protocol onto Ion Tor rent PGM platform that captures the exons of 228 genes AmpliSeq panel to further increase our knowledge on the molecular base of male infertility. In our pilot study we tested this panel on DNA samples of 15 out of 100 pati ents with idiopathic infertility that presented no Y chromosome microdele tions. All samples had 97.85% average of target regions with coverage by at least 30 folds. Data were analyzed using a bioinformatics in house pipeline based on GATK, Picard and Annovar software for reading alignments, vari ant calling, filtering and annotation. Up to date, all analysed patients had a total of 48 possible causative variants in 37 different genes, excluding common polymorphisms, but increasing the number of samples we probably be able to detect more associated variants or mutations.

The sperm gene expression profile could reflect the fertilizing potential of spermatozoa. However, the assessment of human sperm RNAs, generally characterized by low quantity and high fragmentation, is complex. We aimed to develop a strategy to characterize the human sperm RNAs by RNA seq technology. Materials and Methods: Two different methods were used to isolate sperma tozoa from semen (discontinuous density based centrifugation and swim up) and three different methods of RNA extraction (Trizol_Thermo Fisher, NucleoSpin RNA_Macherey Nagel and miRCURY_Exiqon) were compared. RNA samples were DNAse treated and removed from contaminants with Nucleospin RNA Clean up XS_Macherey Nagel. SMARTer Stranded RNA Seq Kit_Clontech was used for library preparation, preceded by a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) depletion step, for which two different procedures (RiboGone_Clon tech and Ribo Zero Gold_Illumina) were compared. Libraries were sequen ced in a HiSeq 2500 (2x50 PE).Results: All sperm isolation and RNA extraction methods provided compa rable results in terms of library RNA class representation. However, explo ratory analysis pointed to a list of 56 protein coding genes differentially ex pressed between gradient purification and swim up sperm isolation. Regar ding the rRNA depletion step, RiboGone provided better cytoplasmic rRNA removal efficiency than Ribo Zero Gold (0.48% vs. 13.1% reads mapping to rRNA), resulting in higher percentage of reads mapping to protein coding genes (75.53% vs. 61.1%). Conclusions: The application of an optimized low input RNA seq procedure to sperm RNA comparative studies may contribute to a better understan ding of the molecular mechanisms underlying male infertility.

Introduction: In repeat expansion disorders (REDs) both normal, as well as permutation and mutation range repeat numbers are highly variable, posing a challenge for molecular diagnostics. In the majority of REDs there is still no single method that would allow identification and sizing of the entire allele range. Therefore, at least two complementing methods are generally required, while sequencing has no special place among them. Using myoto nic dystrophy (DM) as a model, we developed an STR genotyping algorithm that allows massively parallel sequencing (MPS) to be applied, as a first tier test, for the exclusion of the presence of REDs associated expansions. Materials and methods: Following a custom HaloPlex based enrichment, se quencing was performed on Ion Torrent PGM. Repeat number estimations from FASTQ data were performed as follows: motif filtering, annotation of the remaining reads with profile Hidden Markov model and final clustering the annotated reads into groups corresponding to individual alleles. Results: As second generation sequencing (SGS) has standard amplification derived limitations, expanded alleles remained un amplified and un detec ted, making SGS based testing un useful for REDs diagnosis confirmation. Assessed genotypes of healthy range alleles were, however, highly concor dant with those generated by conventional methods, suggesting that even SGS allows diagnosis exclusion if two healthy range alleles are identified. Conclusions: If reliable STR genotyping/annotation tools are exploited in the sequence variant annotation process, inclusion of disease associated re peat regions into targeted sequencing panels may, at least partially, extend the possibilities of MPS based diagnostics into the field of microsatellite ex pansion disorders (financial support: VEGA_2/0115/15).",2016

The aim of this study was to investigate if the high sensitivity of next genera tion sequencing (NGS) allows reliable genetic diagnostics using peripheral blood (PB).Six patients (3xRCMD , 3xRAEB 2) were included in our pilot study. For all patients genomic DNA was extracted from mononuclear bone marrow (BMMC), peripheral blood (PBMC) and immunomagnetically enriched CD34+ peripheral blood cells (CD34+). Sequencing was performed using the TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel and a MiSeq instrument (Illumina).

Exi sting variant pathogenicity predictors do not include knowledge from the (public) clinical domain such as known genomic variation and its relation ship to human health. They cannot reliably perform automated interpretati on for clinical DNA/molecular diagnostics. Here, we address this challenge and present a novel method that delivers accurate computational variant classification. We evaluated allele frequencies, putative protein impact and estimated deleteriousness for >100,000 variants from ClinVar and ExAC in >3,000 genes, resulting in gene specific calibrations of benign versus pa thogenic variants. Next, we developed an algorithm that utilizes these data to classify any new variant that may be found within these genes, and ran successful validation on test sets from VariBench and MutationTaster2. The methodÃ¢ÂÂs power emerged in a clinical setting, where we found an overall yield of 79% (correlation * coverage) compared to 30 67% of existing tools when applied to 2,359 pre assessed variants in patients in five different di seases. This high yield is achieved by a large proportion of variants being located in calibrated genes, demonstrating that human clinical expertise implicitly stored in existing interpreted variant lists can be leveraged to accurately and computationally classify new variants in their gene context.

The HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay (WTA) enables users to measure the expres sion of 2,083 human miRNA transcripts using next generation sequencing. HTG EdgeSeq extraction free sample preparation chemistry is compatible with FFPE, cell lines, extracted RNA, and plasma. Materials and Methods: Two studies were conducted to characterize the performance of the HTG EdgeSeq WTA assay in FFPE and plasma sample types. The sample input studies evaluated a range of sample input amounts for both plasma and FFPE sample types. Optimal input range was esta blished based on sample quality (using process controls) and performance (technical correlation and detection of low expression). Reproducibility stu dies across technical replicates were also performed for both sample types. Results: Read depth, defined as the total aligned counts at the sample level, for FFPE ranged from 524K at the lowest sample input (1.56 mm2/well) to 5 million at the highest sample input (12.5 mm2/well) with no loss of sample quality or expression sensitivity. Thus, for FFPE samples any input volume over the entire range is acceptable. The recommended sample input for plasma was established as 12.5 ÃÂ¼L/well, this volume resulted in a mini mum of 642K reads. Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients on technical replicates ranged from 0.93 to 0.98 for FFPE samples and from 0.82 to 0.98 for plasma.

26166,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non coding RNA molecules that have been identified as efficacious biomarkers for the classification of tumors and prediction of outcome for many diseases because of their evolutionary con servation, unique expression signatures, relative stability, and abundance. Detection of circulating microRNAs in serum, plasma, and other body fluids holds great promise for a non invasive approach to molecular diagnostic and therapeutics. However, detection of miRNAs in these clinically relevant samples has been difficult, often requiring greater sensitivity. A typical stu dy workflow in translational research involves first identifying differentially expressed miRNAs in normal and diseased sample types by profiling many miRNAs, then screening or validation of a smaller set of relevant miRNAs. We have developed a new method for the detection and quantification of miRNAs that is highly specific and sensitive. The upstream chemistry allows synthesis of miRNA template library that is used in the downstream real time TaqMan qPCR for miRNA specific detection. The universality of tem plate synthesis simplifies the workflow and provides the flexibility for sca lable content (miRNA coverage). Whether applied to basic or translational research, profiling, screening, or validation, this new and robust method al lows detection and quantification of miRNAs to address the unmet needs in workflow and sensitivity that exists today with next generation sequencing and other qPCR technologies, especially with clinical samples.

Our results demonstrate that either first morning urine or buccal swab samples provide high quality DNA suitable for next generation sequencing. We tested multiple samples from a patient and her mother with a complex I deficiency, m.13513G>A (p. Asp393Asn, NADH dehydrogenase). Although this mutation was present at higher levels in urine and buccal samples than in blood, it was detectable by NGS in all specimens. Of note, this mutation was not detectable in either a urine or buccal sample from the mother. In contrast, deletion analysis by Southern blot is generally not pos sible on urine or buccal samples as the DNA obtained is insufficient. Additio nally, long range PCR testing of the Kearns Sayre region revealed that urine has low specificity as deletions are frequently detected in normal unaffected control samples. Southern blot analysis using DNA derived from a muscle sample remains the gold standard for mitochondrial testing. We estimate that the sensitivity of Southern blot analysis is 5% for heteroplasmy while the long range PCR detects below 5%. In our experience, a long range PCR of the Kearns Sayre region must be interpreted with other clinical informa tion (such as CN or BN PAGE or respiratory enzyme studies) and should not be used in isolation.

Traditionally, genetic diagnoses were siloed to specific laboratories, based on clinical condition.

Multi gene panels, whole exomes and genome testing present opportunities to explore causative sequence variants for genetic disorders, once achieved by time consuming Sanger sequencing.

Results: Retrospectively, biallelic mutations were identified in 85.3% of the samples and single allele mutations in 7.3%. Samples in which no mutations were detected (7.3%) corresponded to hypothyroidism in half of the cases. In samples with previous genetic diagnosis (n,33), 100% concordance was found and a second mutation was identified in two samples. In the prospec tive phase, current turnaround time is 9 days. Among15 cystic fibrosis (CF) samples analyzed we have found biallelic mutations in 13% cases, single mutations in 53.3% and no mutations in 33.3%.

This contributes to a swift diffusion of NGS technologies into cli nical settings. However, since costs of equipment, personnel, and data ma nagement, are generally not considered, the real costs of NGS are currently considerably underestimated. This study aims to provide a comprehensive, transparent, and up to date overview of the total costs of NGS. Methods: Cost calculations for targeted gene panels (TGP), whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) are based on the Illumina NextSeq500, HiSeq4000, and HiSeqX5 platforms, respectively. Five year lifecycles, 100x (TGP), 70x (WES), and 30x (WGS) coverage, and 15% (TGP), or 75% (WES, WGS) utilization are assumed in the base case calcula tions. To anticipate future developments, sensitivity analyses are performed in which these factors, as well as capital and operational costs, are varied. Results: Per sample costs were Ã¢ÂÂ¬1,669 for WGS, Ã¢ÂÂ¬587 for WES and Ã¢ÂÂ¬333 for TGP . Sensitivity analyses showed that very efficient, long term use of the se quencing equipment, large reductions in both capital and consumable costs, combined with lowering sequencing depth decrease these costs to Ã¢ÂÂ¬1,006 (WGS), Ã¢ÂÂ¬298 (WES) and Ã¢ÂÂ¬205 (TGP).Discussion: Costs for TGP and WES are considerably lower than for WGS. However, this does not imply that these techniques should be preferred in clinical practice, as the choice of NGS approach should be based on a care ful trade off between per sample costs, sequencing quality, and diagnostic yield. The results of the present study contribute to making such trade offs.<br",2016

We present a case where SS failed to con firm a deletion in BRCA2 found by NGS. Materials and methods: Amplicon library of coding exonic and flanking intronic regions of BRCA1/BRCA2 was performed and sequenced by NGS (MiSeq, Illumina). Pathogenic, likely pathogenic or unknown variants and regions with depth <100x were confirmed by SS. Results: A heterozygous deletion was found by NGS in BRCA2: NM_000059.3:c.4000_4001del (depth,4996x, allele frequency,44.5%). ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 325Back to index Amplification with M13 tailed PCR primers usually used in our laborato ry and SS showed absence of the deletion, making us suspect a NGS false positive or a sample swap error. PCR amplification and SS of a new DNA extraction showed in the electropherogram very slight peaks consistent with the deletion. New primers were designed targeting a larger template that included primer binding sites, and SS confirmed the deletion this time. Searching for possible causes for the false negative in SS, we found by NGS a variant (c.4068G>A) in the reverse M13 tailed primer binding site. This variant was absent in the first SS but was confirmed with the new primers. The segregation study supported the hypothesis that the variant was in cis with the deletion and caused an allele drop out. Conclusion: Although SS is the gold standard sequencing method, false ne gatives can occur because allele drop out, which did not occur in NGS, that was able to detect both the deletion and the variant.",2016
26179,"Introduction: Abnormal clinical non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results have been linked to fetal and maternal chromosomal factors such as fetal mosaicism and maternal cancer. Few studies have investigated other biolo gical confounding factors in NIPT analysis. Identifying factors that can affect NIPT analyses can improve future maternal clinical care. Methods: Total plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations are monitored for samples undergoing NIPT at a Hong Kong testing service. Plasma cfDNA levels were quantified as genomic equivalent per mL by PCR or fluorometry. Samples with total plasma cfDNA concentrations more than +5 SDs from the mean were investigated. Further analyses of plasma cfDNA were conducted via massively parallel sequencing +/ targeted sequencing to obtain fetal fraction and cfDNA size. Results: Five cases were identified. Four of these five cases had shorter maternal and fetal plasma cfDNA fragments compared with corresponding reference groups. Three of these five cases had fetal DNA fractions lower than the minimum requirement for NIPT service, necessitating a redraw. A scrutiny into clinical history revealed that each case was associated with an abnormality in the hemostasis system. Conclusions: These cases show that the ability to report NIPT results are affected by high plasma cfDNA, the levels of which may be linked with the hemostasis system. Further research is necessary to elucidate this link. Me anwhile, these cases attest to the importance of including clinical history in NIPT forms and suggest that patients with hemostasis abnormalities should be pre counselled of their higher chance of non reportable result.",2016
26180,"As next generation sequencing (NGS) methods are continuously develo ping novel version of sequencing chemistries come to the market. In case of NGS analysis on IonTorrent PGM recently HiQ version of emulsion PCR and sequencing kits became available. In our study direct comparison of per formance of previously used and recently available sequencing chemistries was performed. NGS libraries prepared with Haloplex method were amplified by emulsion PCR with use of Ion PGM OT2 and Ion PGM HiQ OT2 kits with subsequent se quencing analysis of amplified libraries with Ion PGM sequencing 200 kit v2 and Ion PGM HiQ sequencing kit. Standard bioinformatic analysis on Torrent server was performed for coverage analysis and variant calling. Hundred of SNP and hundred of InDel variants were used in comparison between the kit performance. The utilization of new and improved emulsion PCR and sequencing kits led to gain of sequencing data with significantly increased sequencing accuracy and more uniform coverage of gene targets. The homopolymer associated errors were completely dissapeared in more than third of previously iden tified positions and gone to nondetectable in another third. From the point of view of coverage uniformity, standard deviation of coverage decreased from 180 to 156.Reanalysis of archival NGS libraries with new version of library amplificati on and sequencing could lead to improved results with more accurate vari ant calling and higher uniformity of target coverage.

26181,"Niemann Pick Type C (NPC) disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in NPC1 /NPC2 genes translated in defects of the ly sosomes transport system (cholesterol transporters) leading to abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in the lysosome. Although other organs may be affected (e.g. hepatosplenomegaly), NPC is characterized mainly by progressive neurological deterioration. Recently developed treat ment renders the NPC diagnosis of high importance. The levels of lyso SM 509 in blood reflect the burden of the NP disease and it can be used for the easy diagnosis of NP patients and for monitoring of the disease progression. Determination of lyso SM 509 is performed by LC/ MRM MS, an analytical method proven to be reliable and reproducible both in plasma, serum, EDTA blood and dried blood spots (DBS). Moreover, by combining the results with the levels of lyso SM 465 the type A/B and type C patients can clearly be distinguished. We identified 152 NPC patients using lyso SM 509 and the diagnosis was directly confirmed by sequencing of the NPC1 and/or NPC2 gene. Lyso SM 509 has a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96.5% for the diagnosis of NP . We have identified a total of 300 pathological alleles in the different NPC cases. 63 unique variants (54.4% of total found) are described in Cen toMD exclusively. Conclusion: All cases identified lyso SM 509 biomarker were genetically confirmed proving its high specificity. The ease of DBS based lyso SM 509 makes the marker an ideal parameter for the simple and confident diagnosis of NP as well as the monitoring of the diagnosed NP patients.",2016
26182,"Standard diagnostic laboratory flows based on PCR and Sanger sequen cing often include MLPA analysis when available and relevant. Introducing NGS genepanels in a clinical setting promises a higher diagnostic yield, but is usually used only for sequence variant detection. Normalized Depth of Coverage (DOC) calculation can indicate exon copy number variation (CNV) and might replace MLPA. Our lab has established a NGS sequencing flow using JSI SeqNext software. Recently we validated the effectiveness and usa bility of a DOC CNV submodule using data from genes located on chromoso me X and positive controls. Type and number of reference files (1 on 1 and n,12), signal to noise ratio and detection cut off were evaluated in SeqNext and independent via Z score analysis. Aim: Retrospective analysis of genepanel experiments (232 samples, half cardiomyopathy), comparison to validation results and prospective analysis of future experiments (ÃÂ±12) for exon CNV and wetlab confirmation of calls Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 2 exons and <5% frequency, using an internal database, including a filter of Ã¢ÂÂnoisyÃ¢ÂÂ ROI. Results: In 232 samples (19 experiments) DOC based gender determination using chromosome X located genes, calling was concordant with the recor ded clinical gender. Six multi exon (a.o. RFN170 & SLC20A2) and 10 whole gene CNV (a.o. NPHP1, ACTB) were detected, eight confirmed and eight on going. Manual curation of single exon CNV indicates deep intronic InDels influencing DOC results on capturing and/or mapping level, e.g. 5Ã¢ÂÂ ANKRD1 exon4 (MAF ÃÂ±30%).Conclusion: CNV detection using DOC analysis in SeqNext promises to be an possible replacement of MLPA in diagnostics.

We esta blished linearity and reproducibility assay performance characteristics. Methods: Lung, breast, prostate, and colon carcinomas and melanoma FFPE tissue lysates, THP 1 and HCC78 cell lines, and Universal RNA (URNA) were used for linearity and sample input studies. URNA was used to demonstra te reproducibility of the assay across multiple days and processors. Linear regression R2 and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to assess linearity and reproducibility of the assay. Results: The R2 for linearity across four concentration points for lung FFPE tissue (6.25 0.78mm2), cell lines (1875 234 cells), and URNA (12.5 1.56ng) were >0.97, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. The r between low (1.56mm2) and high (12.5mm2) sample inputs for each FFPE tissue type was > 0.98. The rÃ¢ÂÂs for intra run, inter day, and inter run reproducibility were >0.95, >0.98, and >0.98. Differential expression of tissue specific genes was identified in the respective FFPE tissues, including NKX2 and MUC1 in lung, ERBB2 in breast, NKX3, KLK2, and KLK3 in prostate, and SPP1 and PRAME in melanoma.

26184,"Targeted resequencing is an important application in clinical diagnostics. Due to its flexibility in design, high sensitivity and specificity, the polymera se chain reaction (PCR) is ideally suited as enrichment strategy. Using our in house primer design tool primerXL, we have generated almost one million PCR assays for both fresh frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples, covering over 98.7% of the human exome. Assays were designed to limit single nucleotide polymorphisms in primer annealing si tes and minimize off target amplification. We have validated 2200 assays from 200 disease causing genes. Wet lab success rate was over 96.5 % upon quantiative PCR testing using uniform conditions. Subsequent next genera tion sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina) showed equimolar coverage across the different amplicons with almost 90% of the amplicons having a coverage within 5 fold of the mean. Specificity was very high with almost 95% of the assays having <2% of off target mapping.

26185," Introduction: As new DNA tests such as aCGH on whole uncultured cho rionic villus samples (CVS) and cfDNA aneuploidy screening in maternal blood (NIPT) mainly rely on DNA from cytotrophoblastic cells, discrepan cies with true fetal constitution due to confined placenta mosaicism should be expected, as observed in short term cytogenetic cultures. We report two cases involving both assays. Material and methods: Case 1. aCGH on uncultured CVS was performed because of maternal anxiety using a targeted BAC array (Cytochip Focus, Bluegnome, Ilumina) and followed by cytogenetic analysis on long term CVS culture. Follow up cytogenetic and FISH analysis using LSI D5S23 and D5S721 probes (Vysis/Abbot, USA) were performed on amniotic fluid cells. Case 2. NIPT (NeoBona plus, Labco/Illumina) was performed for ultrasound abnormalities and result confirmation by aCGH on uncultured amniotic flu id using ISCA 8x60K array (Bluegnome, Ilumina).Results: Case 1. A 5p15.2 deletion was detected by aCGH in uncultured CVS. Both deleted and normal cells were observed by cytogenetic analysis of cul tured cells. FISH and cytogenetic analyses on amniotic fluid showed normal results and 5p15.2 deletion was considered a confined placental mosaicism. Case 2. A 1p36 microdeletion was detected by NIPT . aCGH confirmation on uncultured amniotic fluid resulted in 1p36 microduplication, suggesting a possible confined placental mosaicism for the deletion or a low mosaicism of deleted and duplicated cells not detectable by aCGH and NIPT . Conclusions: aCGH on non cultured CVS and NIPT share the same biological limitations of direct analysis of CVS thus occasionally failing to reflect the true fetal chromosome constitution.",2016
26186,"Introduction: Until recently, the standard method for screening for gross ge netic aberrations was cytogenetic analyses such as karyotyping. Analysis of DNA, such as aneuploidy screening by multiplexed analysis of DNA markers has advantages, like, speed, price and representativeness as more cells are analysed. However, as pooled DNA is analysed, specificity may be hampered. In hydatidiform mole (HM) genetic analyses are performed to discriminate between diploid HMs that impose a high risk of trophoblastic neoplasia and triploid HMs that have a benign course. Diploid HMs exist in various forms: Both genome sets originating in the father (PP), one genome set from each parent (PM), and mosaics (PP/PM).Materials and methods: In 270 HMs known to be diploid and 154 known to be triploid by karyotyping and/or flow cytometry, DNA markers were ana lysed. Results: 259/270 diploid HMs showed markers indicating paternal genome exclusively and 3 showed markers indicating a balanced biparental genome. These would have been classified as having the parental types PP and PM, respectively, without knowing the ploidy.8/270 diploid HMs and 154/154 triploid HMs showed maternal and pater nal markers with indication of a higher fraction of paternal genome, either because two paternal markers were observed in one locus, or because sig nals from paternal alleles were higher that the signal from the maternal al lele. These observations could either be caused by triploidy with the paren tal type PPM or by mosaicism PP/PM. Conclusion: In HMs, cytogenetic analyses are superior to DNA analyses for determination of ploidy.",2016
26187,"Current biomedical research aims at personalized cancer therapeutics, for example in prostate cancer. Due to the high prevalence of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion which occurs in more than 50% of cases, it seems to be a suitable biomarker for monitoring prostate cancer which can be detected in less in vasive sample material such as blood and urine. Use of digital PCR is cur rently being demonstrated to be a highly sensitive method for reproducible and robust measurements without the use of standard curves. Especially the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System from Applied Biosystems has a high point of care potential due to the closed, compact and easy to hand le system. Aim of this project was to establish a system for the detection of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion on this Digital PCR platform, which can be deploy ed as a future oriented method. A TaqMan Fusion and a Gene Expression Assay were used to detect mutant and wildtype alleles, and their perfor mance was optimized by changing the temperature time profile. RNA iso lated from fusion positive VCaP and fusion negative LNCaP cell lines were used as reference material. In wet lab experiments it was possible to detect TMPRSS2:ERG transcripts with a detection limit of 0.05% fusion portion in a correspondingly high wildtype background. Spike in experiments allowed the confirmation of an easy workflow. This is a first step forward to apply the assay to prostate cancer samples for monitoring disease and to further validate the significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion as a suitable biomarker.

26189,"Background: Noonan syndrome and related disorders are autosomal domi nant traits resulting from germline mutations in genes evolving the RAS MAPKinase signaling pathway. Thus, these traits are collectively called the RASopathies. The phenotype of RASopathies associate typical facial dys morphia, cardiomyopathies, developmental and intellectual delay, skeletal and cutaneous abnormalities and a higher tumorigenesis risk. Recent advances in genome sequencing have greatly facilitated the genoty ping and identification of causal mutations. In this study, we report our per sonal experience in using Targeted Sequencing for the molecular diagnosis of a cohort of Tunisian patients. Methods: We performed Haloplex custom target enrichment and NGS to screen 29 genes commonly mutated in RASopathies or in other overlapping diseases in 30 cases of Tunisian patients with clinical suspect of RASopathi es. All pathogenic variants were validated by Sanger Sequencing in patients and available parents. Results: 27 pathogenic or probably pathogenic mutations were found in 70% of analyzed patients (21/30). 14 variations were already reported in literature. Molecular findings were consistent with the phenotype in the ma jority of cases. Only in 4 cases, identified variations lead us to review the clinical traits and the initial diagnosis of these patients. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that this approach captures areas of interest with high specificity and uniformity and detects variants with great accuracy and sensitivity. Targeted sequencing willtherefore remain the key to determinate the mutational status in RASopa thies with a rapid and cost efficient manner, and thus, can strongly improve genetic counselling and clinical management of patients.",2016
26190,"For molecular test results to be interpreted appropriately within a clinical setting, the use of universal mutation nomenclature e.g. HGVS, and asso ciated reference sequences is crucial. Locus reference genomic sequences (LRGs) provide a stable genomic DNA framework for reporting mutations and are independent of any changes in transcript numbering, therefore enable accurate location of sequence vari ants. The UK NEQAS for Molecular Genetics 2015 external quality assessment (EQA) schemes demonstrate the clinical impact of misinterpreted reference sequences. Three examples from the molecular genetics/pathology schemes are discussed, where despite the provision of accurate reference informati on, laboratories reported genotyping errors due to inappropriate testing. Long QT syndrome scheme participants were required to test for specific gene mutations and were provided LRGs, however, these were misinterpre ted and one laboratory tested the incorrect exons for two EQA cases, resul ting in critical genotyping errors being reported and the EQA patient being issued with an erroneous result. In the familial hypercholesterolaemia scheme, one laboratory misinterpre ted the LRG provided and reported a false negative result due to incomplete testing. They failed to identify a mutation as only bases 1 to 67 for exon one of the LDLR gene were sequenced. However, LRG_274t1 describes exon 1 as a 284 base pair (bp) transcript that includes 187bp untranslated region.

Currently molecular dia gnosis for SHOX deficiency is carried out by sequencing the coding regions of SHOX and targeted copy number detection assays for the identification of deletions/duplications. In this study, we screened about 350 ISS patients through sequencing and Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) assay. Thirty patients (8.5%) were identified with mutations involving SHOX or its en hancers. In order to see whether there were some patients with alterations not detected through these standard procedures we designed a CGH array (Agilent 8x60K) with a coverage of 8000 probes within the PAR1 region (compared to the 26 probes of MLPA) and additional widely spaced back bone probes. Nineteen ISS patients tested negative with standard methods were analysed with the custom aCGH. Three patients were identified with deletions or du plications in the SHOX area that are likely contribute to ISS. Two deletions of 12.3 kb and 7kb downstream of SHOX, and an amplification including an in tron exon boundary within SHOX were identified. These variations were not reported in the general population. A specifically designed PCR screening on 150 patients identified other 2 patients carrying the 12.3kb deletion. This deletion was not present in 300 controls analysed.

Usage of single molecule (sm) tags improves data quality, by removal of duplicate reads constructing consensus sequences free of ex perimental artifacts. Methods: We have created a fully automated workflow to perform smMIP based enrichment. Sequencing is performed using a NextSeq500 (Illumina). Pre and post PCR Hamilton robots are trained to perform pre and post hybridization pipetting. Automated file handling, data transfer and SeqNext analysis (JSI) delivers high quality sequencing data. Both single genes sm MIP setup and gene panel strategies were tested in the optimized workflow. The small insert size of smMIPs allows usage of FFPE derived DNA. Results: We managed to implement one single protocol for both gDNA and FFPE derived DNA. By advanced automation, time from DNA isolation to in terpretable data is only 4,5 days. Sequencing twice a week is sufficient to handle several hundred samples per week, and sequencing more often only reduces TAT when weekend shifts are included. Single molecules, double tiling and duplicate sequencing deliver very robust data, with Sanger+ sen sitivity and specificity. Conclusions: The newly developed workflow is exceptionally stable and pre dictable in terms of test completeness and outcome. It is functional for gDNA as well as FFPE derived DNA.

Results:We present a comprehensive coverage and variant pattern analysis from data generated through the routine clinical use of such NGS panels. It shows the influence of GC content, DNA integrity, enrichment kit design, sample processing and mean sample coverage in the coverage profile uni formity and stands for the best conditions to perform a more effective CNV analysis. It also depicts the development of a gene specific score which in forms about its specific conservation along evolution and mutational rate, and the subsequent implications on the pathogenicity prioritization of novel mutations found. The higher efficiency of panels with respect to WES and the importance of developing a powerful population variant database are also shown. Conclusions: Detailed knowledge of coverage and variant pattern can be used to achieve a more efficient evaluation of future patientÃ¢ÂÂs dataset in or der to 1) develop effective algorithms for detection of CNVs and 2) to assess the possible pathogenicity of new variants detected.",2016
26199,"Introduction: Telomere lengths in leucocytes and plasma samples are ana lysed with regard to their correlations with various pathological states. Cir culating cell free DNA (cfDNA) represents a biomarker of growing interest in numerous fields of medicine, especially in prenatal diagnosis and onco logy. We studied the variations in relative telomere lengths in plasma and serum in young healthy volunteers with regard to clinical utility of both ty pes of samples. Materials and Methods: We performed quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) to determine relative telomere lengths (telomere/single copy gene T/S ratio) in plasma and serum of 26 healthy volunteers aged 20 25 years. The DNA was extracted by QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. Results: We found significant differences in the relative T/S ratios between paired plasma and serum samples. These ratios were significantly higher in plasma samples (Wilcoxon test, p< 0.0001) than in serum samples. Each sample was rendered by relative telomere length of a control sample. The total amount of cfDNA measured using qPCR on single copy gene was signi ficantly higher in serum in comparison with plasma (p< 0.0001).Conclusions: We detected higher abundance of telomeric sequences in plas ma than in serum but higher levels of total cfDNA in serum samples. Our results suggest the existence of different mechanisms involved in cfDNA re lease and clearance in plasma and serum. Supported by the grants no.

26200,"Background: Inherited bone diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and skeletal dysplasia are responsible for 10% of documented Mendelian dis orders. The effect of genetic variants can only be studied in bone related cells such as osteoblasts but bone biopsies are invasive. On the other hand, dermal fibroblasts are easily obtained. We hereby demonstrate a novel me thod to efficiently derive osteoblasts from dermal fibroblasts, which can be utilized as an in vitro model for the study of osteoblast dependent inherited disorders. Methods: We developed a novel transdifferentiation method to differentiate fibroblasts directly to osteoblast like cells without undergoing the interme diate pluripotent state. After culturing fibroblasts in osteogenic medium supplemented with platelet lysate for 21 days, qPCR analysis of osteoblast specific marker expression was performed at various time points. Alizarin red staining was done to demonstrate the mineralization capability of trans differentiated cells. RNA sequencing was performed to characterize gene expression during the transdifferentiation process. Results: Transdifferentiated osteoblast like cells showed higher expressi on of the early osteoblast marker, Runx2 compared to fibroblasts on day 7 which decreased thereafter. The expression of other markers such as alkali ne phosphatase, osteopontin and osteonectin increased after day 14. Nodule formation by alizarin red staining indicated the mineralization properties of transdifferentiated osteoblast like cells. RNA sequencing confirmed the trajectory to osteoblasts like cells by the expression of components in the BMP , WNT and insulin pathways. Conclusions: Human fibroblasts can be directly transdifferentiated to osteo blast like cells by using a novel platelet lysate based protocol. This opens numerous possibilities for the study of unclassified variants in inherited bone disorders.",2016
26201,"Introduction: Arrays based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been successful for the large scale discovery of copy number variants (CNVs). However, current CNV calling algorithms have a high false positi ve rate for small CNVs and experimental validation using qPCR or custom arrays is labor intensive and expensive. Therefore, this study looks at the possibilities of an in silico validation approach to distinguish between true and false positive CNV calls smaller than 100 kb resulting from existing CNV calling algorithms. Materials and Methods: The study sample contains 646 individuals (159 fathers, 157 mothers and 330 children) from 159 families with non syndro mic autism spectrum disorders. All family members were genotyped using the Illumina Human Omni2.5 8v1 SNP array and CNV calls were made using CNV WebStore. The resulting 42,464 CNVs (1 100 kb) were validated in sili co by comparing the intensities of the underlying SNPs to the distribution of those intensities over all individuals. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 330Back to index Results: Almost half of the CNVs was classified as random noise based on the underlying SNP intensities. Moreover, comparing the position of parents and children in the distribution revealed false negative calls in parents re sulting in de novo CNVs that were actually inherited. Conclusions: The proposed in silico validation approach allows rapid detec tion of many false positive CNV calls smaller than 100 kb, which could thus be excluded from labor intensive and expensive experimental validation approaches. Ongoing research will validate included and excluded CNVs by qPCR to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the method.",2016
26202,"Introduction: Several genetics and genomics journals list requirements for use of HGVS nomenclature and/or submission of variants and phenotype information to public databases in their author instructions. The rationale is to improve the quality of variant descriptions in manuscripts and access to variant information in databases. We have investigated the January 2016 issue of several journals to determine how effective this is. Materials and Methods: We used the list of genetics and genomics journals created by the Human Variome Project (HVP) (See http://www.human variomeproject.org/resources/genetics and genomics journals.html). A group of students has checked the publications first for the basic require ments: mentions of the reference sequence used to describe variants and the presence of the variants in public databases. The next step was to check variant and phenotype descriptions with specific attention for predicted protein effects. Results: Authors include statements suggesting variants have been submit ted to databases, but the variants were not found or phenotypic information was missing. Often, predicted protein effects in publications cannot be veri fied in case of altered splice sites without supporting RNA level evidence or in case of insertions of unspecified nucleotides. Lack of supporting evidence complicates the assessment of disease causing effects for diagnostic use. Conclusions: In multiple cases, information missing in the publication was specified in public databases, indicating that submission of variants to da tabases prior to manuscript acceptance might improve the quality of pu blications. Reviewers and journal editors could help improving manuscript quality by enforcing the existing guidelines and insisting on compliance by authors prior to acceptance of manuscripts.",2016
26203,"Introduction: Reliable chromosome aneuploidy detection in a single cell or from very limited amounts of template DNA is a prerequisite for preimplan tation genetic screening (PGS) of chromosome aneuploidies. The aim of the study was to assess the minimum amount of DNA in terms of diagnostic ro bustness and time to diagnosis in next generation sequencing based (NGS) PGS. Materials and Methods: Single oocytes, polar bodies, blastomeres, trophoec toderm, somatic ovarian cells, cultured choriocytes / amniocytes and isola ted DNA were used to assess the diagnostic reliability of whole genome am plification (WGA; SurePlex), followed by the VeriSeq NGS assays (Illumina; USA). Single sperm were examined using a modified WGA protocol (PMID: 23565289).Results: All samples with known karyotype were accurately replicated by our diagnostic approach. Novel findings, previous undetected, were confir med by MLPA and/or array CGH. During the course of the study we detected a broad variety of aneuploidies, one chaotic embryo and one error in second meiotic division. The ability to detect mosaicism was assessed by artificially mixing DNA derived from blood or cultured choriocytes / amniocytes with known chromosomal constitution. We are able to detect mosaicism in aber rant cells down to 40%, while lower mosaicism could be due to WGA/NGS artifacts. Conclusions: The utilised NGS based assay is robust and reliable for routine detection of aneuploidies in clinical PGS in DNA derived from various single cell types and is able to unambiguously detect eventual mosaicism.",2016
26204,"The advances of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enable their application in clinical care. However, there are several significant chal lenges for their implementation in clinical diagnostics. In Geneva, we use whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by targeted bio informatics analysis of individual gene panels for the diagnosis of Mende lian disorders and we have created a multidisciplinary working group, the Genome Clinic Task Force which meets once a week. During these meetings, clinical cases and results are presented, the class of variant pathogenicity is debated and the final laboratory reports are critically discussed. Reim bursement and ethical issues such as informed consent, disclosure of inci dental findings and/or variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS) are also addressed. In Switzerland, reimbursement of diagnostic NGS tests is integrated in the public health insurance since January 2015. During the pilot year 2015, a total of 144 cases (41 with developmental de lay (DD) and 103 with various other mendelian diseases (VDM)) were ana lyzed. We found pathogenic variants (class 4 or 5) in 27% of patients with DD and in 41% with VDM; the average detection rate of (likely) causative variants was 37 %. The decision to report VUS was made on an individual case basis. In order to render our diagnostic use of NGS even more efficient and patient friendly, our current aims are to 1) improve different steps of the workflow in order to accelerate the analysis process 2) continuously update the vari ant interpretation methods 3) continuously learn from the challenges we encounter during the genetic counseling sessions.",2016
26205,"Introduction: When establishing a molecular diagnosis, we usually search for a single genetic variant which clarify the full phenotypic spectrum of the patient. However, many patients present with complex clinical features not allowing the clinician to make a clinical diagnosis. In these cases with unu sual and blended clinical presentations whole exome sequencing (WES) is especially useful. Results: Here we report 21 families for whom whole exome sequencing pro vided a clear dual genetic diagnosis. These cases presented with a broader or atypical phenotype that could not be explained by the finding of one uni que variant. In 5 of these families, the diagnoses were based on pathogenic/likely pa thogenic variant for both disorders. The rest received a molecular diagno sis based on a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, and a second probable diagnosis based on a variant of unknown significance, with significant sup portive evidence. These diagnoses are likely due to high compatibility of the gene related disease with the clinical details and the mode of inheritance provided by the clinicians. Some relevant examples of dual diagnoses were spastic tetraplegia and intellectual disability (SLC1A4 and HNRNPU ) as well as Donohue syndrome and immunodeficiency type 28 (INSR and IFNGR2 ). Other cases included: cerebellar ataxia deafness, distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type VI atypical Krabbe disease and primary microcephaly type 3 Leber congenital amaurosis. Conclusion: WES allows complete and dual diagnostic analysis and a better dissection of gene specific phenotypic characteristics positioning WES as a first line diagnostic tool.",2016
26206,"ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 331Back to index Introduction: Current clinical next generation sequencing makes use of gene panels and exome analysis, both of which involve selective capturing of target regions. However, capturing has limitations in sufficiently covering coding exons, especially GC rich regions. Materials and Methods: We com pared whole exome sequencing (WES, SureSelect Human All Exon v5+UTR) with the most recent PCR free whole genome sequencing (WGS, Illumina TruSeq) for five female samples. We assessed the proportion of completely and sufficiently covered (>13ÃÂ) RefSeq coding exons. Thereby we analyzed (i) the entire exome and subsets of clinically relevant exons, i.e. (ii) genes re commended by the American College of Medical Genetics or (iii) exons with mutations recorded in the Human Gene Mutation Database. Results: PCR free WGS appears to be insensitive to GC content and is thus able to provide hitherto unprecedented complete coverage of the coding region of the genome. Although the average read depth was less than half (65ÃÂ in WGS vs. 154ÃÂ in WES), the proportion of completely and sufficiently covered coding exons was significantly higher in PCR free WGS for all ana lyzed set of exons. Conclusions: The advantage of WGS does not only include the potential of identifying non coding pathogenic variation but, in view of its more ho mogenous and complete exomic coverage, WGS is the better WES, thereby outweighing the higher costs. Thus, from a clinical/technical point of view capturing is no longer necessary for the most comprehensive genomic te sting of Mendelian disorders.",2016
26207,"Introduction: Whole genome amplification (WGA) is an approach designed to overcome small amounts of DNA for genome wide genetic tests. Various strategies of WGA have been developed; however, none of them can gua rantee the absence of amplification bias. Materials and methods: A total of 4 multiple displacement amplification (MDA) based and 2 PCR based WGA kits were compared in their effect on segmental copy number (CN) changes and copy number neutral loss of he terozygosity (cnnLOH) detection by 3 microarray platforms: CGH/4ÃÂ44K (Agilent), CGH+SNP/4ÃÂ180K (Agilent) and CGH+SNP/4ÃÂ180K (OGT). Geno mic imbalances rich cell line U266 was used as material. Results: The main outcomes are as follows: 1) MDA based WGAs showed higher tendency to generate false positive imbalances in contrast to PCR based WGAs with higher risk of false negativity; 2) the specific risk of false positivity and/or negativity increased with decreasing CN segments size; 3) single cell WGAs showed significantly worse effect on results in comparison to WGAs with nanogram level of DNA as input; 4) PCR based WGAs were incompatible with cnnLOH analysis based on SNP in restriction digestion sites and also showed higher risk of cnnLOH false negativity when combined with analysis based on simple hybridization. Detailed data of each point are presented. Conclusions: The results of this study help to choose WGA according to indi vidual user requirements and options. Moreover, we have shown a strategy to verify and validate segmental CN changes detection by DNA array protocol including any WGA for any purpose to attain the highest efficiency without an unnecessary WGA bias.

In the era of genomic arrays, a role for con ventional karyotyping and FISH is widely discussed. Results: High resolution genome wide array analysis using Affimetrix Cy toscan TM HD array platform was applied in 28 probands with abnormal phenotype. In each case genome imbalance was detected. FISH for every microarray results was performed not to confirm rather a visualization of the abnormal chromosomes. Double segmental imbalances was detected in 17 cases (61%) and in 15 of them a typical microarray pattern for an unbalanced translocation was shown. Parenatal carriers of reciprocal trans locations were estimated by targeted FISH or conventional karyotyping. In two cases a gain and loss were located on the same chromosome and non recurrent inv dup del (10q) and (5p) have been identified by targeted FISH and mBAND. Single segmental imbalances (or loss either gain) was detec ted in 11 cases (39%) and confirmed by targeted FISH in 9 cases. In one case a 8,7 Mb loss in 15q11.2q13.3 was revealed to be unbalanced translo cation due to adjacent 2 malsegregation of paternal translocation (13;15)(q11.1;q13.3).

Genetic variability of immune response genes may contribute significantly to the development of different infectious di seases and sepsis. Materials and Methods: To search genetic markers defining susceptibility to infections 24 children with acute leukemia who had heavy infectious com plications in the course of therapy were selected. PatientÃ¢ÂÂs DNA samples were prepared using Roche NimbleGen Sequence Capture of 17 candidate genes NOD2, NLRP3, STAT1, STAT3, CARD9, IL10, IL17RA, IL12RB1, IL1A, TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, PTPN22, IL7R, IL7, MYD88.

26211,"Introduction: Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness in the industrialized world. Approximately 90% of the visual loss is attributed to the neovascular form of the disease (nvAMD). NvAMD can be treated with intravitreal injections of anti VEGF agents. While this treatment revolutionized the prognosis of the disease, a remar kable variability in the response has been described. Candidate gene vari ant analyses have been inconsistent in explaining this variability, therefore, hypothesis free approaches are needed in order to assess the role of genetic variation in treatment response. Methods: Using a custom modified HumanCoreExome array (Illumina), 678 patients of European descent recruited in five different clinics were geno typed. Response was defined as the change in best corrected visual acuity (VA) after the loading dose of three monthly ranibizumab or bevacizumab injections. An inverse normalization per sub cohort was applied to the dis tribution of the phenotype to control for inter clinic differences. After im putation and quality control steps, 6,464,434 variants with a minor allele frequency >5% were assessed for association with treatment response. Li near regression analysis was conducted adjusting for the first two principal components using EPACTS software. Results: Suggestive peaks on chromosomes 2 and 18 were identified. The top associated variants had a p,2.27x10 6 (chromosome 2) and p,3.83x10 7 (chromosome 18), respectively. For the 34 known AMD lead variants, no va riant showed significance to the 0.05/34 level.

26212,"Introduction: Arsenic was widely used in traditional breast cancer treat ment and recently the interest for therapeutic implication has increased, particularly for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), subtype of breast can cer with the lowest survival rate. In this study were evaluated cellular and molecular effects for arsenic using in vitro models. Material and methods: We evaluated the effect of 50 nM arsenic in normal (HMEC cells) and TNBC breast cancer cells (Hs578T cells) by multiple me thods, such as MTT assay, invasion using a matrigel approach and apoptosis by fluorescence microscopy and transcriptomic profile using Agilent mi croarray technology. Results: Our results showed a reduced cell proliferation and invasion, the activation of apoptosis in a dose response and time dependent manner, es pecially in Hs578T cells as response to arsenic exposure. For HMEC cells we had 1398 downregulated genes and 153 overexpressed genes, mean while for Hs578T cells were 1223 downregulated genes and 648 overex pressed genes based on a fold change cut off ofÃÂ±2 and p valueÃ¢ÂÂ¤0.05. For Hs548T cells the main altered canonical pathways were related to kinases and cAMP mediated pathways and for HMEC cells were related to immune response, particularly IL 17 pathway.

Analysis of proteomics data could be a new approach to targeted therapy of breast cancer. Materials and methods: In the present study we used data set containing glycoprotein expression of HER2 positive cell lines and ER positive cell lines to determine new predictive protein biomarkers related to drug resistance. Dataset of 180 glycoproteins in three HER2 posi tive cell lines, BT474, HCC1954, and SKBR3 in five ER positive luminal cell lines, BT474, HCC1428, MCF7, T47D, and ZR751 were selected and stati stically compared. Network analysis was used to determine the important proteins based on the highest degree and betweenness centrality. Results: We found P07339, P20645, P11279 and P07602 were overexpressed in all HER2 positive cell lines. Furthermore, P05067 and P02751 had highly signi ficant connectivity in glycoprotein network and high betweenness centrality proteins compared with others.

26216,"Introduction: Mutation and CNV analysis of tumour DNA to predict the best treatment options calls for a sensitive technique analyzing multiple targets simultaneously with short turn around time. To obtain sufficient coverage depth usually PCR based enrichment strategies are used to analyze routi nely obtained formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, fine need le aspirates or smears. As in contrast to capture based techniques, these strategies do not allow assessment of the amount of unique template mole cules analyzed. We evaluated a single molecule Molecular Inversion Probe (smMIP) based strategy which precludes false negative results due to unre cognized amplification of a too low amount of template molecules. Materials and Methods: A smMIP based panel with (regions of) 26 genes that serve as predictive or differential diagnostic marker was designed and evaluated on routine diagnostic tumour samples. Results: The smMIP based approach was able to detect all SNVs, small de letions and insertions (1 63 nt) and amplifications. Strand specific ampli fication of both the sense and antisense strand allowed recognition of FFPE induced C>T artefacts. The merging of PCR duplicates with identical Ã¢ÂÂsingle molecule tagsÃ¢ÂÂ into consensus sequence reads provided true sequence cove rage and eliminated the problem of PCR and sequencing artefacts allowing reliable mutation calling at only 3% mutant reads. The technique was robust minimizing the amount of rework and guaranteeing turn around times of maximally 7 days. Conclusions: smMIP based library preparation combines the advantages of PCR and capture based enrichment strategies and fulfils all criteria for use in routine testing of FFPE tumours and small biopsies. It has replaced the PCR based NGS method in our routine diagnostic workflow.",2016

No significant as sociations were found between treatment outcome (SVR, relapse) and age, gender, HCV genotype, baseline viral load as well as biochemical and histo pathological parameters. Conclusions: Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that rs4803217 polymorphism is a useful marker for predicting SVR and virolo gic relapse in IFN based therapy of chronic hepatitis C.",2016
26219,"Introduction: Aging is a dynamic process in which its rate and subsequent longevity of an organism are dependent upon the balance between the re active intermediates of normal cellular metabolism and the ability of the body to reduce these by products. Environmental, genetic, and accidental factors have influenced the human life span. Advanced glycation end pro ducts (AGEs) may play an important role in the processes of physiological aging. Ageing and smoking may also contribute to the acceleration of the formation of AGEs. The aim of the present study was to investigate any dif ferences in the frequencies of receptor for the advanced glycation end pro ducts (RAGE) 82G/A polymorphism in subjects aged >100 years and indivi duals suffer from respiratory illness (accelerated aging).Material and Methods: RAGE 82G/A (rs2070600) was analyzed in a cohort of 126 subjects aged >100 (107 women and 19 men) and 158 individuals with pulmonary disease (29 women and 107 men). Genetic marker was de termined by RT PCR. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender was performed. Results: Regression analysis showed differences between (RAGE) 82G/A polymorphism frequency in both groups (OR,23.8, 95% CI,12.5 45.4). The number of women was larger among long living subjects than in the un healthy group. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that 82G/A polymorphism appears to confer sensitivity to respiratory illness and are in accordance with the fact that the SNP 82G/A is associated with lower levels of circulating RAGE than 82 G/G genotype. The differences in the genetic regulation of inflammatory processes may influence the presence of aging disorders.",2016
26220,"Background: Thiopurine therapy is effective in CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease (CD) treat ment, although 25% of patients will suffer toxicity. Polymorphisms in genes involved in thiopurines metabolism may affect toxicity. We aim to analyse the role of TMPT and ITPA functional variants as pharmacogenetic markers of thiopurines toxicity in CD. Methods: Patients with CD treated with thiopurines and with TPMT enzyme activity levels >5 U/ml RBCs were included. We analysed 3 variants in the TPMT gene (c.238G>C, c.460G>A and c.719A>G) and 2 in the ITPA gene (c.94C>A and IVS2+21A>C). Genotyping was performed by real time PCR. Results: We included 109 CD patients. One hundred and four patients (95%) were treated with thiopurines in monotherapy. The mean follow up period was 87.4 months (range 4 264). Thirty three patients (30.3%) developed one adverse drug effect and 11 patients (10.1%) had more than one. The most frequent adverse events were lymphopenia (n,23, 21%), hepatotoxic ity (n,15, 13.7%), nausea (n,9, 8.2%) and leucopenia (n,6, 5.5%). Forty patients (36.7%) discontinued thiopurine treatment because of toxicity. We found a statistical significant association between the IVS2+21A>C ITPA variant and toxicity (OR,3.1 [95% CI, 1.18 8.24], p,0.022, in a dominant model). Toxicity was more frequent in patients carrying the C allele than in patients with an A/A genotype (55.6% vs. 35.4%). In addition, patients carrying the C allele had a higher risk of treatment discontinuation than ho mozygous A/A patients. Conclusions: The IVS2+21A>C ITPA variant might be a predictor marker of thiopurines toxicity in CD patients with an intermediate or high TPMT activ ity.",2016
26221,"Introduction: CYP2C19 is an enzyme responsible for metabolism of about 10% of all clinically used drugs. Different variants in CYP2C19 promoter re gion influence transcription activity of the gene. Interindividual variability in CYP2C19 activity is responsible for pharmacokinetics, drug efficiency and adverse drug effects. In this study we examine the influence of 889T>G va riant on CYP2C19 promoter activity. Materials and methods: The 1705 bp of the promoter region of the CYP2C19 gene was cloned into pGL4.1 luciferase reporter vector and transfected in HepG2 cell line. To evaluate the basal activity of wild type and 889T>G promoters, dual luciferase assays were performed. Since in silico analysis revealed presence of glucocorticoid response element in the target region, we analyzed influence of dexamethasone as potent glucocorticoid agonist on both promoters. Results: The basal activity of promoter containing 889T>G variant was about 33% lower in comparison to wild type promoter (p<0,05). Further, we observed difference in activity between these two promoter variants in response to dexamethasone treatment. Dexamethasone increased the acti vity of both promoter variants, however effect on 889T>G variant promoter was less noticeable. Conclusion: Our results indicate that 889T>G variant decreases promoter activity of CYP2C19 gene. Dexamethasone differently influence the activity of wt and 889T>G promoter variants. Since, CYP2C19 c. 889T>G variant can contribute for interindividual variability in drug response, further charac terization of this variant and evidence of transcription binding sites in this region are needed.

26222,"The Cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme, encoded by CYP2D6, is among the most important enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Specific variants in the gene are associated with changes in the enzymeÃ¢ÂÂs amount and enzymatic activity, which determines the rate at which drugs get metabolized. Different technologies exist to determine these sequence variants, such as the Roche AmpliChip CYP450 GeneChip, Taqman qPCR or Next Generation Sequen cing. However, sequence homology between several cytochrome P450 genes and pseudogene CYP2D7 impairs reliable CYP2D6 genotyping and phasing (haplotyping). The PacBio RSII sequencing platform produces a combinati on of long reads and high quality consensus sequences, enabling accurate variant calling and haplotyping. We sequenced CYP2D6 in 24 samples with 12 different, clinically relevant, haplotypes using the PacBio sequencer and obtained full length, phased CYP2D6 sequence reads, enabling accurate variant calling and haplotyping. Unphased diplotypes, previously determined with the Roche GeneChip, were confirmed for 21 samples, including a duplication of one of the ha plogroup sequences for three samples. Two samples, originally showing a single haplogroup sequence, were subsequently demonstrated to contain either a deletion or tandem duplication. In total 62 unique variants were detected across the 24 samples, as well as variants not previously been associated with the described haplotypes. To aid analysis using standard reference sequences and HGVS nomenclature, we have established a LOVD powered CYP2D6 variant database and added all reference haplotypes and data reported here. In conclusion, our genotyping approach produces reliable CYP2D6 genotype calls, and reveals additional information about phasing and copy number variation.

Additional variants of SLC47A1/2 genes, encoding multidrug and toxin extrusion pro tein 1 (MATE1) and MATE2 K, have been also recently related to treatment outcomes. Materials and Methods: Since previous studies were mostly performed in healthy subjects, here we analyzed several common variants of SLC22A1/2 and SLC47A1/2 genes in 92 newly diagnosed T2D patients. We also collec ted phenotype data including, but not limited to, levels of fasting glucose (FG), insulin (FI), HbA 1c and anthropometric measures, prior to and 6 and 12 months post metformin treatment. Results: Our data demonstrated significant association of SLC47A1 rs2252281 SNP with higher decrease of FI levels (p<0.05) and lower HO MA IR (p<0.05) upon 6 month treatment. Interestingly, we showed that SL C47A2 rs12943590 was associated with lower decrease of FI levels (p<0.01) and higher decrease of HOMA IR (p<0.01) upon 6 month treatment in T2D patients, which is in line with the in vitro data showing that this SNP in creases transporter activity resulting in decreased drug effect. Conclusions: Our results indicated that both MATE genotypes were as sociated with the markers of insulin resistance, with variant carriers of MATE1 and MATE2 K having an increased and reduced levels of these markers post metformin treatment, respectively. Thus, these findings sug gest that MATE1/2 variants could play the key role in mediating insulin re sistance and optimal response to metformin.",2016

Digital PCR (dPCR) is a promising tool that may provide the required sensitivity to accurately perform EGFR mutation detection in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The aim of this study was to assess the detection of EGFR mutations in plasma samples from NSCLC patients. Methods: Fifty eight plasma samples from 25 EGFR mutant NSCLC patients were assessed for EGFR mutations by dPCR Quantstudio 3D using valida ted Custom TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays specific for each mutation and compared to standard of care (SOC) EGFR testing in plasma samples by BE AMing. Paired tumour biopsies were available for 28 samples. In addition 10 negative plasma controls from breast cancer patients were also tested by dPCR. Results: Analysis by dPCR detected EGFR mutations in 54/58 plasma samp les tested. Interestingly, in 4 cases in which no mutation was detected by SOC testing, dPCR provided a positive result. A significant correlation was found between dPCR and SOC results quantitative values (R, 0.835, p<0,001), and this high correlation was observed among all EGFR mutations tested. No EGFR mutations were observed in any of the negative plasma samples tested. Paired plasma and tumoural samples were available in 28 samples. EGFR mutations were detected in plasma in 23/28 patients by dPCR sho wing a sensitivity of 82.1 %.Conclusion: Digital PCR is a sensitive technique for detecting EGFR mutati ons in plasma samples.

Despite significant advances in our understanding of the basis of disease, the cause underpinning most human disorders remains fully or partial ly unknown. Identification of molecular changes provides an opportunity to understand their role in disease, and in a clinical setting to apply that understanding to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The advent of ge nome wide sequencing has altered how molecular changes are identified and has transformed Medicine. We have 6 years of experience in the field of Clinical Genomics gathered as Molecular Diagnostic Labs, Freestanding and ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital Genomic Medicine Clinics, and through large NIH funded research programs. Currently, we achieve a ~38% diagnostic suc cess rate via WGS application in a population that has in general undergo ne significant prior MDx. This shows that WGS is in many cases superior to conventional tests. Of note we are finding cases where patients have more than a single genetic diseases. In such cases an unbiased WGS approach si gnificantly impacts care by finding all or most variants contributing to di sease. Application of WGS has identified causal variants that would not have been uncovered through application of WES. In this talk we will discuss the technological, infrastructure, and process advances that have allowed us to perform lower cost Clinical WGS at HiSeqX scale. We will also present notab le clinical findings that have helped us define the boundaries of the utility of this approach.

26225,"The emergent T cell checkpoint therapy has offered durable and potenti al curative results for many NSCLC and melanoma patients. Nevertheless, fewer than half of subjects in trials exhibited positive response (Sharma, 2015). These results greatly illustrate the necessity for a better understan ding of tumor microenvironment, tumor lymphocyte interactions, and bio markers that could predict drug sensitivity. In particular, PD L1 expression has been reported to be a promising marker of response for PD L1 therapies (Meng, 2015). However, standard methods for assessing PD L1 protein level via immunohistochemistry have been shown to be inefficient and highly va riable (McLaughlin, 2015) depending on selected antibodies, staining tech niques, and site of tumors (Meng, 2015). Furthermore, as investigators are often also interested in measurements of many immune related markers, a gene panel approach offers a convenient solution to objectively quantify ex pression levels. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a research panel of approximately 300 genes designed to evaluate the expres sion of immune checkpoint pathway, level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, T cell regulation, interferon signaling, and presence of various lymphocyte subsets. Our preliminary data shows that expression of the selected genes can stratify non small cell lung cancer FFPE samples by histopathology. Fur thermore, quantitative read out of the IFNg is clear and unambiguous for IFNg positive and negative controls. Gene expression was measured by NGS using Ion AmpliSeqTM technology.

The IP is always associated with skin defects while the other neuroctodermal tissue can be variabily affected. Data from BBRMI Incontinentia Pigmenti Genetic Biobank at IGB Institute (IPGB, http://www. igb.cnr.it/ipgb) failed to reveal genotype phenotype correlation in our IP cohort because of a high variabile phenotype: the neurological alterations (mental handicap, epilepsy etc.) in 34% of IP cases (IP CNS), did not correla te to specific NEMO mutations. We performed exome sequencing of 3 unre lated severe IP CNS cases carrying the same loss of function NEMOdel4 10 mutation, followed by targeted sequencing of 141 candidate genes clustered in cobalamin/folate and fatty acids oxidation pathways, in a cohort of 40 cases, 20 with severe IP CNS (mental handicap, epilepsy etc.) and 20 mild IP (only skin defect).We found a high frequency of genetic variations in cobala min/folate metabolism among the IP severe cases (p value<0.05). Common variants in MTHFR, MTRR, CUBN, ABCD4 genes known to affect homocystei ne metabolism and in ACACB gene were present in different combinations in 16 IP severe (80%) and in singly in four control subjects (20%). Moreover, among the damaging variants we found a previously described mutation in CPT2 and a new MTRR mutation, each in a single IP CNS case. This impli cates cobalamin/folate gene variants as risk factor for severe IP CNS in the presence of the common NEMO deletion. These genetic variants are relevant biomarkers for clinical validation that will lead to the development of new targeted therapies for IP .",2016

We made genotype and haplotype analyses of the MDR1 gene in 96 CML patients. Genomic DNA was extracted and was analyzed by PCR RFLP . Of the 96 CML samples, 31 were (CC), 13 (TT) and 52 (CT) for exon 12 (1236). For the exon 26 (3435), 35 were (CC), 12 (TT) and 49 (CT). All frequencies for both polymorphisms were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p,0.229 and q,0.414).

26228,"Background: EGFR mutation assessment is essential for deciding therapy of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Mutation detection in cir culating cell free tumour DNA may be an alternative to tissue analysis at diagnosis and useful for tracking tumour clonal dynamics. Methods: 112 plasma samples from 25 EGFR mutant NSCLC patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were collected at baseline and along the course of the disease. EGFR mutations were quantified by BEAMing and/or digital PCR (dPCR).Results: Comparison of 28 paired plasma and tumoural samples showed de tection of EGFR mutations in plasma in 23/28 cases (8 cases M1a/M0; 15 cases M1b ) showing a concordance of 82.1%. 4/5 plasma negative cases were M1a. 7 patients were analysed at radiological response to TKIs and showed undetectable EGFR mutation (n,5), decrease in mutant load (n,1) or increase (n,1). In one out of 2 responding patients with plasma samples previous to radiological evaluation, EGFR mutation was undetectable, being an early predictor of response. Samples from 13 patients at radiological progression showed an increase in EGFR mutant load (n,5) or re emergence of mutations (n,8). The p. T790M mutation of resistance was detected in 5/13 samples. In 4 cases, samples obtained prior to radiological progression, EGFR mutations reappeared (n,2) or increased (n,2).Conclusion: A high association (82.1%) in the detection of EGFR mutations was found between plasma and tumour biopsies with BEAMing and/or dPCR.

PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations were determined by primer extension method. Correlations between PIK3CA mutations and clinicopathological features were estimated with the chi squared test (95% CI). Relaps free survival (RFS) rates, in the subgroup of HER2+ breast cancer patient treated with trastuzumab were calculated, based on the Kaplan Mei er method, and the curves were compared using the log rank test. Results: Frequency of PIK3CA mutations were detected in 25,9 %. Mutation p. E17K in AKT1 gene was detected in 1,9 %. PIK3CA mutations were significantly as sociated with ER+ (p,0,0004), PR+ (p,0,004) and borderly significant with low histopathological grade (p,0,05).

Conclusions: This study confirm high prevalence of PIK3CA mutations and their significant correlation with some clinicopathological characteristics. In the present study, patients with activating mutations in PIK3CA had a poorer outcome than PIK3CA wild type cases.

The plat form is developed with both clinical and non clinical settings in mind. It implements three main computational steps: 1) imputation, 2) ancestry inference, and 3) genetic prediction. Through careful choice of algorithms and efficient implementation, the whole pipeline can be applied to a 23and me genotype in about one minute, ensuring an interactive user experience for all of the three steps. To demonstrate how the application can be used in practice, we provide an online implementation (http://thehonestgene.github.io), where users can upload their 23andme genotypes and obtain polygenic predictions for height and BMI. The polygenic risk prediction is carried out using LDpred weights, which are trained on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. To estimate the accuracy of the predictions we used self reported height and BMI from 609 Danish high school students as validation data. The prediction R2 in the sample after adjusting for age, sex, and the first ten PCs was 25% for height and 11% for BMI.",2016

The aim of our study was to assess the potential pharma cogenetic interaction between this PD derived genomic region and all trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a potent morphogen with evidence of metabolic ef fects. The adult SHR and SHR Lx male rats were administered ATRA (15 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 16 days. The same protocol was repeated with animals undergoing administration of 1mg/kg ATRA on 13th day of embryonic de velopment (13ED). All rats were subjected to comprehensive metabolic and morphometric profiling. In a separate experiment, effect of prenatal (13ED) ATRA administration on manifestation of polydactyly in SHR (n,118) and SHR Lx (n,178) offspring was assessed. We identified significant interactions of both prenatal and postnatal admi nistration of ATRA with the differential segment in SHR Lx congenic strain. The sensitising effect of the Lx was apparent for prenatal ATRA, affecting adiposity, HDL and small LDL cholesterol fractions, while postnatal ATRA affected significantly VLDL cholesterol and LDL triglycerides. SHR Lx offspring developed front feet preaxial polydactyly in 13.5 % cases; no such effect was observed in SHR.

26238,"Introduction: Pharmacogenetic studies require a reliable method to test samples for inherited variations in drug metabolizing enzymes (DME) and associated transporter genes. Here we report a novel, target activated, uni versal probe based rhPCR genotyping assay for amplifying and detecting specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multi nucleotide poly morphisms (MNPs), and insertion/deletions (InDels). This technology uti lizes a Type II RNase H (RNase H2) in conjunction with a novel mutant Taq DNA polymerase to achieve highly specific allele discrimination and elimi nate primer dimers. A universal reporter system was used to achieve a cost effective genotyping solution, and enable multiple fluorophore detection of multi allelic variants in a single reaction. This approach is particularly useful in pharmacogenetics where increasing numbers of tri allelic SNPs are found to have pharmaceutical and clinical value. Materials and Methods: In this study, we designed a collection of >150 as says for detecting potentially causative SNPs, MNPs, or InDels in DME genes, including tri allelic targets. The assays were designed using an optimized assay design algorithm, ensuring high target specificity. All assays were te sted with 137 Coriell DNA samples from three populations and synthetic templates representing each genotype. Result: We successfully demonstrated >95% coverage for the desired tar gets (including tri allelic SNPs), and >99% call rate and 100% accuracy were achieved for the tested samples. Conclusion: Our target activated rhPCR genotyping technology provides a cost effective and highly specific genotyping solution. Multiplexing with multiple universal probes allows us to perform multi allelic genotyping in a single reaction, thereby reducing the cost per genotype.",2016

26240,"Thiopurine S methyltransferase (TPMT) is the most important enzyme involved in metabolism of thiopurine drugs, such as 6 mercaptopurine (6 MP). Great variability of TPMT activity cannot be explained considering just coding region variations. Variation of regulatory elements, such as VNTR architecture (i.e. number and types of repeats) in promoter, as well as che motherapy drugs are shown to influence TPMT enzyme activity. However, it is not known whether these factors influence TPMT gene expression in ALL patients. TPMT gene expression was measured in hematopoietic tissue of 57 child hood ALL patients, both before chemotherapy and during the maintenance therapy when 6 MP and methotrexate are administrate. Our results show that maintenance therapy strongly induces TPMT expres sion, more than 3 times, on average. For each ALL patient, TPMT expression was higher during maintenance therapy, than before chemotherapy (p<10 10). An interaction of maintenance therapy with VNTR region in TPMT pro moter modified TPMT gene expression. Specifically, VNTR*5a/*5a carriers were found to be the highest expressers during the therapy (p,0.045), even though they were low expressers before chemotherapy. Our results confirm negative correlation between Ã¢ÂÂ AÃ¢ÂÂ repeats number of VNTR and TPMT gene expression (rs, 0.35).Maintenance therapy strongly induces TPMT expression. This effect is mo dified by architecture of VNTR region of TPMT gene.

26243,"Outside of the simplest cases such as haploid bacteria, or inbreds, genomic information is not carried in a single reference per individual, but rather has higher ploidy for almost all organisms. The existence of two or more highly related sequences within an individual makes it extremely difficult to build high quality, highly contiguous genome assemblies from short DNA fragments. We have here developed a new algorithm and software called FALCON that is a polyploidy aware assembler for de novo haplotype reconstructions from SMRTÃÂ® Sequencing data. We sequenced Craig VenterÃ¢ÂÂs well studied genome at 85 fold coverage using long insert libraries (>20kb) as input for single molecule sequencing. We then used the hierarchical genome assembly pro cess (HGAP) to generate highly accurate pre assembled consensus reads, which were fed into an overlap consensus assembler. FALCON was applied to enable a diploid representation of the genome while maintaining the re lationship between the alternative alleles in the form of associate contigs. Altogether the genome was assembled into 3004 contigs where the longest contig was 34.6Mb in size. In order to assess the quality of the assembly we looked at how efficiently we captured the 4 Mb MHC region on chromosome 6.

26244,"Introduction: Molecular interaction networks are crucial for the interpreta tion of genome wide data of pathologies characterized by a marked genetic heterogeneity like Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Indeed biological functions involved in a specific pathology are likely to be more conserved than individual genetic variations. We define the network regions enriched in genetic variations associated with ASDs. Compared with previous studies, we consider several reported evidences and the whole network topology to predict relevant interacting partners of ASDs genes. Materials and Methods: Lists of genes associated with ASDs were collected from a manually curated database and genomic studies. A diffusion based method was used to identify genes in network proximity to those from the lists. Direct and indirect protein protein interactions were collected from five different databases. The Italian cohort (195 cases and 87 controls) was genotyped with a high density platform. Results: We defined genome wide scores summarizing the proximity of each gene to the gene lists associated to ASDs. We highlighted the network regions, with corresponding biological functions, differently represented in the considered genomic studies. We found significant number of genes in network proximity to genes associated with ASDs among the genes reported in the literature as having a minimal evidence of association with ASDs and the genes containing alleles associated with ASDs in our Italian cohort. Conclusions: We summarise the network regions densely populated by ASDs associated genes providing a network based tool to quantify the func tional relation of novel genes with those already associated with ASDs.

These guidelines provide means to classify variants into different well defined classes (e.g. Pathogenic, Benign, etc.). Integrated into the NxClinical softwa re system is the Variant Interpretation Assistant (VIA), which uses a decision tree machine learning approach to set up rules for automatic pre classifica tion of events to be reviewed and interpreted by laboratory personnel. The system allows users to embed guidelines for consistent reporting.

26247,"High throughput screening (HTS) techniques, like mendeliome, whole exo me and genome screening, are becoming a routine in a clinical diagnostic setting. However, classifying the identified genomic variants as benign or (likely) pathogenic, is still a tedious and time consuming process for the (clinical) geneticist. To facilitate this variant classification process, we have developed GeVaCT , a standalone Java based tool that implements and auto matizes a published variant classification scheme for autosomal dominant disorders. GeVaCT currently supports annotated variant files from Alamut Batch (Interactive Biosoftware), with future plans to support input from other variant annotation tools. The variant classification process currently implemented in GeVaCT is based on a published scheme in the context of cardiac arrhythmias (Hofman et al., 2013). The implemented scheme consists of two phases: pre processing and variant classification. During pre processing, the annotated variant file from Alamut Batch is imported and filtered based on the presence of the variant in databases with described variants or a local database, the variant locati on, the coding effect and the variant allele frequency in an ethnically mat ched population. The variant classification workflow depends on the type of variant: either missense or nonsense/frame shift. Each attribute used gets a weighted score that is summed up with the others to come to a first variant classification. This first score is updated based on familial and functional information obtained for the variant of interest. The final result is a classi fication of the variant in one out of five classes ranging from non pathogenic to pathogenic.",2016

Here, we analyse phenotypes related to thrombophilia by partitioning the explained variance into a gene tic component, a transcriptomic component and the residual effect. Materials and methods: Our data corresponds to the GAIT2 project on idio pathic thrombophilia, whose cohort includes 935 individuals stemming from 35 pedigrees. 481 quantitative phenotypes were measured at time of recruitment, including anthropometric measurements, hemogram, hemo stasis traits, as well as phenotypes related with platelet activity, homocy steine metabolism, inflammation and flow cytometry. We also sequenced the mRNA transcriptome from whole blood. We perform variance component analysis on linear mixed effect models that explain the phenotypes in terms of the kinship structure and the gene expression. Additionally, we extend these models conceiving a pathway en richment technique that tests whether including the gene expression simi larity based on a particular pathway improves the explained variance in the phenotype. Results and conclusions: On one hand, models involving kinship and expres sion recover previously reported heritability estimates for known pheno types. Furthermore, their error term decreases by introducing expression in the models, therefore explaining former residual variance in terms of am bient factors. On the other hand, relevant pathways improve specific phe notype models, such as platelet activation explaining platelet abundance in blood.

Despite their biological relevance, their mechanistic origins are poorly understood. While the study of chromosome fragility has been mainly focused on the sequence and architecture of chro mosomal breakpoints, we hypothesize that other factors, above all epigene tic conditioning, should be considered. In particular, we are using the gibbon genome as a model, as this species displays an unusually high occurrence of evolutionary chromosomal rear rangements and we have characterized the position of chromosomal break points at very high resolution. We are employing a comprehensive strategy to explore the epigenetic landscape surrounding gibbon human synteny breakpoints. This includes measuring DNA methylation, CTCF binding, hi stone marks and chromatin conformation (HiC seq) in gibbon and five ad ditional primate species and correlating these data through bioinformatics analysis. Through this integrated analysis, we discovered that the epigenetic landsca pe of gibbon breakpoint regions is distinct from other genomic regions and remarkably conserved when compared to orthologous regions in other pri mates, indicating that the epigenetic state of breakpoints preceded gibbon speciation and was preserved after the genome reshuffling. Surprisingly, we find that the two sides of the breakpoints noticeably differ from each other in the distribution of DNA methylation rates and CpG density. This lack of chromatin homogenization could indicate a selection for chromosomal to pological domains driven by functional effects.

Copy number variants (CNV) are a major cause of monogenic disease, with over 30,000 CNVs reported in the DECIPHER database. A number of tools are designed to use read depth data from targeted Next Generation Sequen cing (NGS) panels to identify CNVs, but in order to do so with the highest degree of sensitivity it is necessary to make modifications to account for the biases inherent in the data. Factors such as GC content and ambiguous mapping of reads due to repetitive sequence elements and pseudogenes are the principal components of technical variability. In addition, the algorithms used to interrogate the data favour detection of multi exon CNVs, and are reliant on suitably matched normal dosage samples for comparison. We de veloped a strategy for calling CNVs using read depth in targeted NGS panels that divides the target intervals into 120bp windows, and utilises a pool of historic samples for comparison to overcome these limitations for use in a diagnostic laboratory. We validated our strategy against an unmodified pipeline to assess sensitivity using the R software package ExomeDepth, using a cohort of 109 samples with MLPA detected heterozygous CNVs (91 deletions, 18 duplications in 26 genes), which included 25 single exon CNVs. The unmodified strategy detected 104/109 CNVs, giving a sensitivity of 89.62% to 98.49% at the 95% confidence interval.

26255,"Exome sequencing has become a mainstay of gene disease association in both the research and clinical settings. Despite this success, overall clinical research identifies roughly 25% of causal phenotypes, suggesting the need for improved methods. To this end, we have developed an enhanced exome that utilizes the barcoding of long DNA molecules, updated capture probes and improved informatics to produce a more complete exome assay. Of note, the new long range information allows phasing of >90% of the genes in the exome from a single library and the addition of supplemental baits offers further increase. Additionally, the assay allows for analysis of genomic regi ons that are inaccessible to standard methods. For example, genes such as RPS17, which have numerous paralogs in the genome, are typically not ana lyzed in standard assays due to alignment ambiguity of short reads. Impor tantly, this approach also increases sensitivity to detecting complex variants, including CNVs and gene fusions, allowing us to phase these complex vari ants with SNVs.

To improve on this, we propose PopSV, an analytical method that uses multiple samples to control for technical variation and enables the robust detection of CNVs. We show that PopSV is able to detect up to 2.7 times more variants compared to previous methods, with an accuracy of about 90%.

Based on the experience from the 1st RD Connect Ã¢ÂÂBring Your Own DataÃ¢ÂÂ (BYOD), November 2014 and the results of a survey, February 2015, it was decided to organize a Ã¢ÂÂBYOD for beginnersÃ¢ÂÂ. This workshop was held in Rome on September, 2015 and was organized by Istituto Superiore di SanitÃÂ in collaboration with the RD linked data and ontologies task force, the Lei den University Medical Center, EBI, Elixir and DTL. The workshop had as main aims: promote data sharing, show basic princip les and benefits of the Ã¢ÂÂdata linkage approachÃ¢ÂÂ. Introductory lectures and a tutorial were prepared specifically for beginners. Attendees first used a tra ditional approach to create two mock registries and perform simple count statistics. Secondly, a Ã¢ÂÂdata linkage approachÃ¢ÂÂ was followed using Uniform Resource Identifiers for all terms linked to ontologies to define the meaning of the terms. This facilitated merging the registries with reliable counts. A follow up survey showed that the main lesson was clear to most partici pants: ontology based data linkage makes data linkable and clearly identi fiable at the source, which has the benefit of readily obtaining unambiguous answers to questions that require data from several sources. We greatly thank participants and contributors to the workshop. Workshop was sponsored by RD Connect and DTL/Elixir. CC, MR equally contributed to the work.",2016
26259,"We introduce a computational approach for deconvolution of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects into eQTL effects specific for cell sub sets present in these complex samples. The proposed statistical framework (Decon2) consists of two components: 1) Decon cell, that estimates cell counts using molecular profiling data (e.g. expression data or methylation results obtained from heterogeneous samples) and 2) Decon eQTL, which subsequently deconvolutes the overall eQTL effect into cell type specific eQTL effects. We observed that estimated cell counts obtained with Decon cell agree very well with the measurements determined experimentally. The correlation coefficient between predicted and measured cell/tissue proportion range from 0.75 to 0.99 using 9 different datasets. Subsequently we applied De con eQTL to whole blood RNA seq and cell count data obtained from 626 individuals. We were able to replicate 40% of published neutrophil eQTLs determined using purified neutrophils [Andiappan et al. 2015].

26260,"Introduction: Endometrioid Endometrial adenocarcinoma (EEC) is a com mon cause of gynecological cancer death in Europe and North America. At diagnosis, 75% of women have the disease confined to the uterus, (Stage One). Five year survival for Stage One patients is 80%, however, 15 20% develop metastasis. Materials and Methods: Total RNA extracted from tissues obtained after surgical resection from three women at stage one EEC was subjected to RNA sequencing. The publicly available dataset (SRP045645) was downloa ded directly from the Sequence Read Archive and the FASTQ files were pro cessed with Biomedical Genomics Workbench for secondary analysis inclu ding mapping, quantification and differential expression analysis. Through streamlined integration the data was uploaded to Ingenuity Pathway Analy sis (IPA) for biological interpretation. Results: QIAGEN Bioinformatics solutions enabled us to analyze the biologi cal parameters involved in EEC metastatic progression from early stage in three patients diagnosed at Stage One. By comparing these patientsÃ¢ÂÂ RNA seq results, we determined that key Canonical Pathways and other biologi cal processes differentiated the three patients from one other. In particular, the predicted transcriptional program allowed us to visualize key upstream drivers. Three of these transcriptional drivers are immune related molecu les (two cytokines: CXCL14 and GDF15 and one growth factor FGF3). They have been predicted to be potential master regulators of a Causal Network that drives increase of EEC, metastasis, epithelial to mesenchymal transiti on (EMT), and cellular invasion in one of the three patients. Conclusion: Based on these results we propose these three immune mole cules as possible therapeutic targets to counteract the metastatic processes in EEC.",2016

We hypothesized that epistatic inter actions of APP with other genomic locations could mediate the link between its common variability and LOAD. Material and Methods: We performed a novel genome wide enrichment analysis of epistatic effects for 25 SNPs that spanned the APP genomic regi on. 8 APP SNPs were consistently enriched in interactions with the ephrin receptor family comprising 13 genes. We tested 36 significant interactions derived from the previous analysis in two additional validation studies. Results: 14 interactions remained significant in the meta analysis over the three studies (total cases/controls,3,935/2,103), confirming the epistatic enrichment of the ephrin family with APP . In particular, two interactions of APP , one with APHA4 (rs380417*rs1025369, pvalue,0.0003) and ano ther with APHA5 (rs2186302*rs12499393, pvalue,0.001), were also signi ficant in one of the validation studies. Functional data of 127 healthy brains showed 1) eQTL effects of rs380417 in both APP and APHA4 in the singular cortex (13/27 significant transcripts in APP , 10/23 in APHA4), and 2) eQTL effects of the interaction rs2186302*rs12499393 in both APP (19/27) and APHA5 (12/23) over the whole brain. Conclusions: Common genetic variation of APP may be associated with LOAD through interactions with EPHA4 and EPHA5; two genes previously associated with LOAD and familial AD, respectively.

26262,"Clinical use of whole exome sequencing (WES), especially in patients with complex differential diagnosis and previous negative genetic tests by tra ditional approaches, is increasing. In certain populations, consanguinity is a frequent situation and the risk of autosomal recessive disease is directly proportional to the degree of parental relationship. In this condition, WES becomes a challenge when there is no other affected individual in the family. Developing an accurate testing strategy is necessary to reach a high diagno stic rate, avoiding wasting time and effort. We present results of a cohort of patients from unrelated consanguineous families, analysed using the Illumi na HiSeq2500 platform and the SureSelectXT Human All Exon 50Mb V5 Kit (Agilent Technologies).We obtained an average of 64,034 variants per case, which were filtered using our in house diagnostic algorithm.

Introduction: Reliable tools discerning between rare and common genetic polymorphisms within a local context are essential for effective analysis of NGS clinical data for disease studies. Initiatives like 1000Genomes and ExAC have released population allele frequencies (AF) for single nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) and insertion deletions polymorphisms (INDELs). Albeit useful, they consider Europe as an entity, are biased towards a few European subpopulations, and require centralised raw data processing. Materials and Methods: GEEVS (GEUVADIS European Exome Variant Server) integrates multi centre restricted access AF data, and offers country speci fic variant characterisation. Contributing centres apply standardised GEEVS protocols for variant calling (integrating several tools and custom filters), quality control, and variant aggregation. Only aggregated AF and coverage profile data are shared with the central server. The Ã¢ÂÂmaster aggregatorÃ¢ÂÂ function performed at the central server subsequently produces European and country specific AFs, and enriches each variant with functional informa tion, damage predictions (SIFT , PolyPhen2), and OMICs information (dbSNP , 1000Genomes, EVS, UCSC Genome Browser).Results: GEEVS aggregates variants from 2817 individuals of European ance stry, by integrating anonymised, restricted access data from five European contributors. GEEVS checks data quality in terms of AF distribution, Ti/Tv ratio, AF concordance with 1000Genomes, and haplotype concordance with Genome In A Bottle gold standard. GEEVS achieved quality values similar to ExAC without requiring centralised processing. Conclusions: GEEVS extracts high quality aggregated AFs from restricted access clinical NGS data and computes country wise variant characterisati ons, providing precise local context information for disease studies.

Over 1,200 children aged 6 9 years from six existing birth cohorts across Eu rope participate in the study. The exposome was assessed through multiple biomarkers of exposures (e.g. metals and organic pollutants), questionnaire (e.g. diet), geographic information systems (e.g.air pollution), and personal monitors (e.g. physical activity).In the same children, the metabolome, proteome, transcriptome and epi genome were analyzed.

However assumptions regarding un derling genetic architecture of the traits are still under discussion referring the Ã¢ÂÂmissing heritabilityÃ¢ÂÂ problem. For instance one may assume either ma jor genes or numerous small genes that might control trait of interest. The objective of this study was to prediction of SNPs effects (by assuming both major gene and polygenic inheritance simultaneously) using testis weight of house mouse to detect fertility related loci. Material and Methods: We used 185 house mouse (Turner and Harr (2014) ) with 156202 SNPs for mapping variants for relative testis weight. We as sumed mixture of different normal distributions for the SNP effects to be predicted. We also used single SNP model to evaluate only major gene as sumption for fertility trait. Results: Single SNP approach detected genomic signals from 8 loci (chro mosomes of 1, 6, 12, 14, 17, X). However after multiple hypothesis testing correction we could only confirm suggestive genomic signals using single SNPs approach. When we assumed polygenic inheritance 1123 SNPs explai ned all of genomic variance. Most of those SNPs (>0.98 of them) had tiny effect. JAX00486833 at chromosome 2 had the highest explanatory variance (0.057). Conclusion: These findings show that assuming different effect sizes for the SNPs lead to better genomic predictions for testis weight. This stresses the importance of the assumptions regarding genetic architecture of the com plex traits used in GWAS.

26266,"Disease phenotypes manifest both at physical and genetic level. The alterati ons in the physical state of a patient can help to identify its underlying cause such as the presence of a genetic abnormality or an infection. However, often it is not possible to identify these abnormalities, underlying a phenotype or only on a broad level, using the limited number of variables derived from the physical state of a patient. Using gene expression profiles as a marker for disease, the expression of each gene can be used as a variable greatly extending the number of measurable variants. We have previously shown that it is possible to identify over expressed genetic regions in cancer pa tients, which proved to correlate with genomic duplications. These could potentially be used as biomarkers for different cancer types. In this project we aim to extend this analysis to other phenotypes using RNA seq data, which is more sensitive. Using RNA seq blood data from over 5,000 exten sively phenotyped patients, we aim to identify gene expression variation that is unique to patients that share specific phenotypes, such as obesities, smoking and depression. To achieve this, we correct samples from patients harnessing the phenotype with signals that occur in individuals that do not have this phenotype. The residual signal then represents/explains the ab normal genetic phenotype. These signals can be investigated to identify key players underlying the phenotype and potentially be used as biomarkers for diagnosis that potentially allow to differentiate between different sub types of disease.",2016

Methods: We propose digNet, a novel network based method integrating GWAS outcomes and protein interaction network (PIN) to identify a densely interconnected gene sub network enriched in association signals. Our method is based on zero one quadratic optimization, which can be solved exactly and efficiently through min cut algorithms. The digNet approach possesses two desirable properties: (i) the selected genes are densely inter connected, thus functionally related; (ii) the results are robust against noise. Results: We applied digNet to the outcomes of two meta analyses of 9 childhood asthma GWASs each (~3000 cases/3000 controls in each meta analysis). We identified a gene sub network of 172 genes that was consi stent across the 2 datasets. This network is significantly associated with childhood asthma (P<10 5) and shows strong interconnection (P,7x10 5). Out of the 172 genes, 5 are known asthma genes while 148 genes, with nominally significant gene wise P values, represent novel candidates. Nine immune related gene families and KEGG pathways were found enriched in these genes. These results show the advantage of our method to identify novel functionally related candidate genes for asthma. Funding: FP7 316861, ANR11BSV1 027, ANR USPC2013.",2016

A linear regression model was fit to each transcript cluster (TC) expression value considering gender and completed distance as covariates. Statistically si gnificant differentially expressed TCs were obtained from a moderated t statistics performed for each coefficient in the model (adjusted p value 5%, FDR). An over representation analysis was applied to the differential TCs querying KEGG PATHWAY and The Gene Ontology (GO) databases. An inde pendent component analysis (ICA) was computed to extract the indepen dent expression modes among the differential TCs. Results: 5084 distinct genes were prioritized being 37% down regulated and 63% up regulated. Over represented biological pathways were most ly associated with: genetic information processing, infectious disease and immune system. ICA identified seven independent regulation expression modes as response to exercise. Conclusions: The intervention impacted heavily on the gene regulation pro cesses, so that up to one fourth of the total variance related to coding RNA activity was captured as response to the exercise.

26269,"Cancer is a genetic disorder associated with high rates of accumulation of somatic mutations. However the majority of mutations are neutral and have no impact on the cell, and only few are under positive selection and are ob served in cancer more frequently than expected by chance. Several statistical algorithms exist to detect putative cancer driver genes, however they do not exploit the mutational properties of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Tumonc, the novel algorithm for detection of driver mutations in cancer estimates the non uniform genomic background mutation rates as a func tion of tumor type specific mutational profile in three nucleotide context, DNA replication timing, chromatin state and transcriptional activity. The principal novelty of the TumOnc algorithm is based on the assumption that the oncogene may contain a very limited number of sites which upon gain of function mutation turn proto oncogene to oncogene and subsequently are characterized by recurrent mutations. In combination with the calculated background mutation rates per nu cleotide and per patient this allowed us to identify significantly recurrent mutations, with sensitivity for oncogenes superseding existing algorithms. TumOnc is also designed for the detection of tumor suppressor genes sear ching for loss of function variants in both alleles.

26270,"The identification new therapeutic concepts for human diseases is challen ging because it requires a deep understanding of the molecular pathology. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have become a powerful tool to disclose new molecular mechanisms of complex diseases. However, the de velopment of new therapies based on these findings is hampered by additio nal hurdles i.e. causal gene mapping and target efficacy & feasibility. We have developed a new gene prioritization approach using weighted scores for target gene feasibility, function, specificity & novelty. Each score is derived from multiple sub scores which again can be weighted according to specific requirements. We applied this approach to a recent GWAS for Schizophrenia (SZ) including 108 loci. Causal gene mapping has been parameterized by using the number of co ding genes per loci as an inverse estimate for target feasibility. As additional sub score for this dimension we applied the gene protein product class and the homology to model organisms. Gene function has been parameterized by GWAS significance & literature evidence. Target specificity has been de rived from genome wide expression datasets in different sub categories (brain vs. periphery, cell type specific and pattern in cortical sub regions). Target novelty has been estimated from the inverse number of SZ related publications. The combined scores with flexible weighting allows interactive ranking of the 340 coding genes. Using default weight parameters predicts some well known SZ target genes at top ranks i.e. CACNB2 (#1), DRD2 (#2) or GRM3 (#10).

26276,"Introduction: Increasing evidence supports that some solid tumors and leu kemias are organized as cellular hierarchies, sustained by cancer stem cells. Molecular markers for different stages in these hierarchies could potentially be exploited for targeted therapies. Materials and Methods: Here we introduce a novel, computational approach to characterize tumor cell hierarchies. In sharp contrast to traditional ap proaches, which rely on physical cell sorting and analysis of sorted cell frac tions, we exploit high dimensional matrix decomposition to identify genes that discriminate the different stages in cancer cell hierarchies through deconvolution of gene expression profiles of unsorted tumor cells. Impor tantly, our approach completely avoids the need for physical cell sorting. Instead, genes that discriminate different stages in the neoplastic hierarchy are identified by mathematical unmixing. To obtain robust results, the pro cess is constrained by L1 regularization and a priori information about nor mal cell development in the same tissue. Results: In systematic validation experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of recovering cell type specific markers, and cell fre quencies, from real and simulated expression profiles of mixed cell popu lations. Particularly, using large scale unmixing of unsorted Acute Myeloid Leukemia samples, we were able to identify both known and new markers for leukemic stem cells. Conclusion: Our work establishes deconvolution of expression profiles of mixed tumor cell populations as an innovative approach to characterize tu mor cell hierarchies, potentially facilitating the development of therapies towards cancer stem cells.

26277,"Introduction: Apoptotic tumour cells shed DNA that ultimately becomes cir culating tumour DNA (ctDNA), which can be recognized in plasma by the presence of tumour specific alterations. Dynamics in the level of ctDNA can reflect changes in tumour burden within a patient and, as such, its measu rement is a highly specific and potentially versatile biomarker for solid can cers. Materials and Methods: Various methods for quantifying ctDNA exist inclu ding those relying on massively parallel sequencing. We use these to quan tify ctDNA in patients with NHLs and evaluate its utility as a biomarker and with molecular tagging strategies, are exploring ctDNA as a substrate for non invasive genetic characterization. Computational approaches facilitate inference of clonal populations within tumours populations and we used these to determine whether ctDNA recapitulates this clonal structure. Results: We have detected ctDNA in most relapsed NHL patients with many cases exhibiting levels that facilitate genetic characterization. We show high specificity for ctDNA changes in predicting treatment response. Our methods enable non invasive characterization of tumour heterogeneity including mutations in plasma that were poorly supported in the matched biopsy. Sequencing of serial plasma samples has also revealed clonal evolu tion including the emergence of mutations in genes that likely contributed to treatment resistance including STAT6, MS4A1 and NR3C1. We used single cell sequencing methods to confirm and refine clonal populations in NHLs allowing resolution of evolutionary history of treatment resistant tumours. Conclusion: Sequencing of ctDNA is a powerful means to study somatic tu mour genetics non invasively and can inform on clonal complexity and evo lution in NHLs.",2016
26278,"Introduction: Sepsis is a major cause of death in the adult intensive care units worldwide. Lung microbiome shifts may associate with severity in sepsis. Here we assessed the performance of the Ion Torrent sequencing platform for microbiome profiling. Materials and Methods: We used the Ion Torrent PGM (Thermo Fisher) for 16S rRNA V4 amplicon based sequencing. Performance was assessed by using pooled genomic DNA from 20 bacteria compared to that of a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). Then, a mixture of 12 clinical bacterial strains com monly isolated from lungs was used to compare the performance of distinct DNA extraction procedures. Pre processing, taxonomic classification, and diversity analyses were done with a QIIME based pipeline. Results and Conclusions: While virtually all reads were full length for MiSeq, these constituted only 33.4% of the reads for Ion Torrent. We found good agreement between the relative bacterial abundance at the genus level bet ween the two platforms only if fragment size filtering was relaxed in the Ion Torrent reads. Furthermore, the use of DNA extraction methods combining chemical and mechanical lysis significantly improved diversity and abun dance estimates, allowing to better recapitulate the bacterial community. These results have major practical implications for the following studies being conducted in specimens of human origin.

26279,"Changes in methylation along the DNA are often revelatory of what regulato ry activities are taking place in a cell. Such variations have been observed in promoter regions, along gene bodies, in enhancers, at splicing sites and else where. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing can measure cytosine methyla tion with 1bp resolution over an entire genome; the interpretation of these data needs analysis tools which discern noise from relevant structures. Here I explain a simple greedy algorithm designed to analyze methylation by first segmenting it into homogeneous regions. The definition of homo geneous can be tuned to the problem at hand, given that this procedure can find both many small (almost constant) stretches or fewer large blocks which contain more substantial variation. The package (called GIML) analy zes an entire genome at ~30000 positions/sec. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

GIML can also find differentially methylated regi ons with different lengths across samples. Multiscale smoothing algorithms play an essential role in unraveling epi genetic measurements,by making visualization easier and distinguishing experimental artifacts from the underlying biological signal. The long term question is how do these experimental data correlate with each other and what do they tell us about molecular mechanisms: I think that the kind of quick, principled simplification of methylation data performed by GIML is an useful step in answering that question.",2016
26280,"Introduction: The gut microbiome inhabiting human intestine plays impor tant role in the processes occurred in human body. Many environmental and intrinsic factors are linked with gut microbiome, with both one way causa tions (age, gender) and reciprocal relations (BMI, blood lipid level, medi cation). It was shown earlier that some bacteria inhabiting human gut are heritable, so the human genome can influence the microbiome. In this work, we performed statistical analysis to estimate the effect of SNPs to the micro biome structure. Materials and methods: The data from 981 individuals from the LifeLines DEEP population cohort was used. For each individual, both genotyping (Immunochip, Illumina) and metagenomic sequencing (paired end Illumina reads) were performed. The preprocessing of the microbiome data included QC control and filtering from human DNA followed by MetaPhlAn2.2 map ping. Multiple distance matrices (Bray Curtis, Jaccard, weighted/unweigh ted UniFrac) were used as a dependent variable to estimate the SNP effect on microbial structure. Results: The MicrobiomeGWAS pipeline was applied to 106,912 immu ne SNPs passed QC and MAF filtering steps. We identified one significant (FDR q value < 0.1) association (for the chr5:721791) using Jaccard bina ry dissimilarity and 16 associations (rs4481881, rs1020822, rs11130380, rs16928058, 12 SNPs near the HLA locus) with weighted UniFrac distances. Across the distance methods, the p value estimations are consistent within groups of weighted/unweighted distance measures. Conclusions: we identified 17 candidate SNPs that influence the microbiome structure. Overall the effect of genetics on the microbiome is moderate.",2016
26281,"Introduction: A recent twin study has suggested that microbial composition in humanÃ¢ÂÂs gut is heritable and can be affected by the genetics of the host. However, up to date very few association was detected at single SNP level. In this study we related host genetic variation to the bacterial abundance and function in the human gut in 1,561 individuals. Materials and Methods: Using imputed SNP genotypes and metagenomics sequencing data of three Dutch population cohorts, LifeLines DEEP (n, 1021), 500Fg (n, 435), MIBS (n,105), we linked genome wide SNPs to the abundance of bacteria (bQTLs) and activity of bacterial pathways (bpQTLs). We used the LifeLines DEEP cohort as a discovery dataset and replicated the associations between SNPs and bacterial taxonomies or pathways in the two other datasets. Results: In the LifeLines DEEP cohort we identified 9,423 suggestive bQTLs and 5,192 suggestive bpQTLs at P < 5x10 5. None of the bQTLs were signi ficantly replicated, but we do observe a trend of low p values. Five of the top bQTL combinations reach genome wide significance in a meta analysis over all three cohorts. Conclusions: Even though the gut microbiome is shown to be heritable we observed that the overall effect of single SNPs on microbiome is modest and observe a weak replication of the relations between species and pathways in the gut microbiome and host genetics. We believe a roughly twice as large sample size is necessary to identify the complex relations between the host and microbiome composition and function.",2016
26282,"Molecular inversion probes (MIPs) is a target enrichment technology that allows simultaneous screening of 1 to 80 genes in large cohorts at a cost of less than Ã¢ÂÂ¬1, per gene per sample. However analysis of resulting data is complicated by intrinsic properties of MIPs. This limits current freely avai lable software for robust analysis of MIPs data. Therefore MIPPIT was developed: a fully automated JAVA based tool that enables fast, and robust analysis of MIPs data. It runs multi threaded on a single node or workstation with a minimum of configuration. During map ping, using the BWA algorithm, reads are subsequently demultiplexed using barcode sequences, stripped of probe sequences in a probe specific manner, and deduplicated per individual sample on the basis of random tags. The re sulting BAMs are automatically used for multi sample variant calling using GATK, and annotated using gencode, dbSNP , ExAC, and several other publi cly available data sources. MIPPIT supports variable target lengths, and can handle different strategies for random tag incorporation. To test MIPPIT , it was used to detect variants within a dataset of 75 samp les sequenced for BRCA mutations. Running MIPPIT took 7.5 hours on a 8 CPU computing node. Outcomes were compared to results obtained using commercial software (seqNext). MIPPIT reported all variants detected by seqNext, however in addition it also reported some variants that were over looked by the latter. To conclude we believe that MIPPIT is able to analyse MIPs sequencing out comes in an efficient, reliable and robust manner.",2016
26283,"Allele specific gene expression associated with genetic variation in regulato ry regions can play an important role in the development of complex traits. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in microRNA (miRNA) response ele ments (MRE SNPs) that either disrupt a miRNA binding site or create a new miRNA binding site can affect the allele specific expression of target genes. By integrating public expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data, miRNA binding site predictions, small RNA sequencing, and Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (AGO CLIP) datasets, we identified genetic variants that can affect gene expression by modulating miRNA binding efficiency. For the first time, all identified MRE SNPs were classified based on whe ther the allelic direction from eQTL analysis was supported by the logic of miRNA mediated regulation (concordant or C type associations) or not (un concordant or U type associations). No significant overrepresentation of C type associations was observed from our analyses (Chi square test, P>0.05). However, some of the most suggestive eQTL associated MRE SNPs locate in the miRNA response elements (MREs) that are supported by experimental evidence. We also identified MRE SNPs located in regions associated with complex traits, indicating possible causative mechanisms associated with these loci. The results of this study expand the current understanding of gene expressi on regulation and help to interpret the mechanisms underlying eQTL effects.

ORG 351Back to index identification of miRNA mRNA interaction is still open. There are five widely used miRNA mRNA interaction predictive tools: TargetScan, Pictar2, PITA, RNA22 and miRanda. It was impossible to understand if can we trust these predictions. However recently the new method ÃÂ«CLASHÃÂ» was developed to identify all miRNA mRNA interactions. Materials and Methods: We created algorithm to compare experimental data from Ã¢ÂÂCLASHÃ¢ÂÂ experiment with predicted miRNA sites by all five al gorithms from Ã¢ÂÂStarBaseÃ¢ÂÂ database. Expression data for mRNA and miRNA were used from FANTOM5 and GEO. Results: We estimated working of miRNA mRNA prediction programs by the following criteria: sensitivity, positive predicted value, predictions in diffe rent mRNA regions (3Ã¢ÂÂUTR, CDS, 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR), predictions for different types of interactions (5 classes), predictions of Ã¢ÂÂcanonicalÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂnocanonicalÃ¢ÂÂ inter actions, and testing by using random data for miRNA binding sites. We com pared miRNA binding sites predicted by programs with Ã¢ÂÂCLASHÃ¢ÂÂ data and we found 602 miRNAs: 218 were observed only in Ã¢ÂÂCLASHÃ¢ÂÂ data, 216 only in predicted data and 168 either in Ã¢ÂÂCLASHÃ¢ÂÂ and predicted data. Expressi on analyze of miRNA revealed several interesting groups: highly expressed miRNAs without any interactions, highly expressed miRNAs with small number of interactions and lowly expressed miRNAs, which take a part in a lot of interactions with mRNAs.

26285,"Introduction: More than 1 in 4500 women suffer from MÃÂ¼llerian duct ano malies (MDA), which are often associated with renal, skeletal or cardiac malformations. The etiology of these conditions is unknown, and the mole cular basis of the female reproductive tract (FRT) differentiation is not fully understood. Murine FRT morphogenesis begins in embryonic day E13, in which the mesonephros harbours both Wolffian and MÃÂ¼llerian ducts, and concludes in E17 with fully differentiated FRT and regressed Wolffian ducts. Materials and Methods: In order to identify genes involved in the morphoge nesis of the FRT , we performed microarray analysis of global RNA expressi on of CD 1 male and female murine mesonephric tissue, during the embryo nic days E13 and E15. For each assay, three biological replicates were pooled and microarrays were performed by duplicate. Results: Differential expression patterns were observed among age and gen der, and an E15 female signature was identified, corresponding to genes ex pressed at the midpoint of the FRT differentiation window. Wnt (p,7.8e 05) and TGF Beta (p,7.1e 05) signalling pathways, among other biological pro cesses, were statistically overrepresented in these data. For instance, WNT4 mutations were previously associated to a hyperandrogenic form of Mulle rian aplasia in humans. Other components of such pathways participate in MDA, formation of limbs, and cardiac abnormalities in mice, suggesting that these mutant phenotypes in humans may result from functionally coherent orthologous gene sets. Conclusions: Our results will be useful to prioritize candidate genes for MDA and will contribute to the current knowledge on FRT morphogenesis.

26287,"Matteo, Pavia, Italy. Molecular laboratories make use of commercial and/or public resources to build up internal knowledge databases of genomic variants in order to im prove classification of pathogenic mutations. Matching mutations identified by a laboratory and those collected by these resources is often challenging, due to different formats used. Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) established therefore a standard format to improve knowledge sharing of genomic variants. However, even implementing HGVS recommendations can be error prone, especially if va riants are manually curated or specific genomic databases (e.g. transcript subversions) are not used. For this reasons, we developed MUText, a bioinformatic tool freely available online (http://engenome.com/mutext) that checks and converts mutations represented in HGVS v2.0 format. MUText not only performs a syntax check of variants according to HGVS gui delines, but also tests the consistency of each variant with respect to a speci fic transcript subversion that can be chosen after selecting a reference geno me and a transcript database (e.g. RefSeq and GENCODE for GRCh37/h38).MUText returns error messages highlighting these inconsistencies by chek king if the replaced nucleotides match the reference genome in the corre sponding genomic positions. Variants are then converted to genomic coordi nates and formatted according to ANNOVAR in order to be easily integrated in a custom database. We tested MUText on the Retinoblastoma LOVD (http://rb1 lsdb.d loh mann.de/home.php?select_db,RB1) reporting 1734 unique variants on RB1 gene (NM_000321.2) in HGVS format.

26288,"Introduction: Chromosomal inversions, rearrangements where a fragment of DNA become reversely oriented, can explain part of diseasesÃ¢ÂÂ genetic cau ses. Whereas small inversions can be detected using NGS techniques, detec tion of large chromosomal inversions requires cytogenetic techniques that are not suitable for a high throughput scanning of the samples. Large ance stral chromosomal inversions generate regions with lower recombination rates resulting in the formation of haplotypes. This information can be used to cluster individuals in different inversions genotypes using data from SNP arrays. One of the main limitations of this approach relies on large sample size and SNP coverage requirements. This can be overcome by using NGS data. Material and methods: Differences between the consensus sequence of the standard and the inverted haplotype are used to properly genotype inver sions using NGS data. Whole genome sequencing and SNPs array data from 1000 Genomes project have been used to demonstrate our methodÃ¢ÂÂs perfor mance. When consensus reference is not available, we propose an algorithm that can infer the consensus reference for the different haplotypes using the variants found in the samples.

26289,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology considerably changed the way we screen for pathogenic mutations in rare Mendelian disorders. However, the identification of the disease causing mutation amongst thou sands of variants of partly unknown relevance is still challenging and effici ent techniques that reduce the genomic search space play a decisive role. Usually segregation or linkage analysis are used to prioritize candidates, however, these approaches require correct information about the degree of relationship among the sequenced samples. For quality assurance an automated control of pedigree structures and sample assignment is therefore highly desirable in order to detect label mix ups that might otherwise corrupt downstream analysis. We developed an algorithm based on likelihood ratios that discriminates between different classes of relationship for an arbitrary number of geno typed samples. By identifying the most likely class we are able to reconstruct entire pedi grees iteratively, even for highly consanguineous families. We tested our approach on exome data of different sequencing studies and achieved high precision for all pedigree predictions.

26290,"Validation and assessment of variant calling pipelines for NGS in routine diagnostics is a challenging field because of adjustments to specific genetic analyses, different platforms and absence of solid reference datasets. A com mon approach is to build datasets from Sanger or Microarray data which makes validation time consuming, expensive and still not reliable. Here we present a detailed evaluation of the validation procedure for routine diagno stic pipelines and suggest useful adaptations. Concerning reference datasets, the Genome In A Bottle NGS data (NIST RM8398) is suitable and offers more high confidence variant calls compa red to the 1000Genomes data. Large discrepancies between 1000Genomes and our data required additional Sanger sequencing for clarification (90% of discordant calls were in fact FPs and FNs from 1000Genomes). For stati stical evaluation, we propose to use the positive predictive value instead of analytical specificity, which is misleading due to the disproportion of TNs to the number of variants. We performed a detailed analysis of different filter settings for variant calling to determine which parameters have the most influence on FP and FN calls. Additionally, we set thresholds for coverage and quality adapted to each type of variant. It is crucial to determine and report the limitations of the pipeline because of pseudogenes, paralogues and repeat sequences. These low confidence regions need to be identified for further verification of variant calls with other methods if necessary.

26291,"Introduction: Many different tools have been developed to perform se quence alignment, a central part of NGS data analysis. Choosing the right tool with the right parameters for a given dataset is a difficult task. Often different aligners perform better than others on parts of the same dataset, making it hard to choose the right tool and configuration. Materials and Methods: We propose a new approach called meta alignment, which combines the output of multiple sequence aligners to build the best possible alignment. Based on a score matrix, the best possible alignment for every aligned sequence is chosen among the different aligners. Our approach has been tested on multiple simulated datasets, comparing the results of multiple sequence aligners with the results of meta alignment which combines their individual results. Results: We could show that combining the output of multiple aligners in creases the amount of aligned sequences as well as increasing the amount of correctly aligned sequences. This result especially holds true if the sequencing data contains a high amount of errors. Conclusion: We could show that at the expense of analysis time, the result of sequence alignment can be improved by combining the results of multiple sequence aligners. The results are consistent throughout the different tests, and are especially pronounced for datasets with high error rates.",2016

Data can be generated by any NGS machine and most variant callers. Variant calls are annotated using DBNSFP (providing predictions from 6 different programs, splicing predictions, prioritization scores from CADD and VEST , MAF from 1000G and ESP), ExAC, GoNL and SnpEff, subsequently imported into the database. The database is used to compute global statistics, allowing for the discrimi nation of variants based on their representation in the database. The GUI ea sily allows for complex queries to this database, using shortcuts for criteria such as Ã¢ÂÂsample specific variantsÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂvariants common to specific samplesÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂcombined heterozygous genesÃ¢ÂÂ.

26294,"Identification of top candidate genes from a pool of large data sets is com putationally challenging. Existing prioritization tools typically utilize fusion of different annotation sources. However, these tools have important short comings. First, outdated annotation sources lead to annotation errors pro pagating to downstream analysis. Second, data fusion approaches generally fail to address sparsity and dependencies in annotation sources. Finally, high throughput scalability is limited. We propose pBRIT , a fast and adaptive tool integrating ten different annota tion sources (Pubmed, GO, HPO, Pathway, Interactions, Disease Ontologies, GAD, HuGe, BLAST , Mouse Ontologies) into the prioritization approach. Our hypothesis states that genes involved in similar disease types share similar Ã¢ÂÂfunctional and phenotypeÃ¢ÂÂ characteristics that can be used in disease gene identification.pBRIT is based on an Information Theoretic approach that models depen dencies and sparsity of annotation sources for effective feature mining. Bayesian regression is applied to a training set, consisting of known disease genes, to learn a linear mapping between functional and phenotype annota tions. Based on this mapping, candidate genes are ranked according to their relatedness to the training genes. We validated pBRIT on 1154 genes from 12 different disease classes and compared performance against four existing tools (ChenB et al BMC Med Genomics 2015).We achieved an average AUC of 0.91 as compared to 0.83 for the best scoring existing tool, indicating excellent sensitivity and specificity.

26296,"The last years have seen a great interest in genomic structural variation and despite the difficulty of their study, an increasing amount of information is starting to accumulate about human inversions. However, one important li mitation in the case of inversions is the presence of large inverted repeats (IRs) at the breakpoints, which precludes determining the orientation of the intervening region by most simple methods. Here we describe a new linkage based application of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for the validation and genotyping of inversions mediated by IRs. First, we established that the strategy works for a few known human inversions with defined genotypes, including the well characterized Chr. 17 inversion. Next, we developed ddP CR assays for a total of 18 inversions, with sizes ranging from 6.8 to 747 kb and IRs from 6.3 to 134 kb, and we genotyped them across 15 individuals of diverse origins. Our analysis allowed us to confirm all the tested inversions, except two, for which the inverted orientation was not found in our small sample or the assay could not distinguish both orientations. In addition, by comparing with previous data and independent replicates, we have shown that the technique is highly accurate and reproducible. This work illustrates the power of partitioning in ddPCR for diverse applications. Furthermore, it makes it possible for the first time to screen quickly a large number of samples to assess the potential functional effects and clinical implications of these rearrangements.

26297,"Introduction: Several methods exist to identify population substructure that is due to shared genetic ancestry or regional proximity. These may be SNP based or haplotype based (Price et al. 2006, Lawson et al. 2012). Here, we present a flexible unsupervised clustering approach that is built on the ipP CA machinery (Intarapanich et al. 2009).Methods: Our method supports both numeric and categorical data, and can be applied to panels of SNPs and/or haplotypes, or gene based integrative summaries (Fouladi et al. 2015). Unlike ipPCA, our method involves an itera tive process using binary and ternary splits based on multivariate Gaussian mixture modeling of PCs and Clustering EM (CEM) estimation as in (Lebret et al. 2015). To assess performance, we considered different simulated sce narios of F ST,[0.0005,0.006], 5,000 20,000 independent SNPs in HWE, 500 8,000 individuals, and 2 4 populations (Balding and Nichols 1995), with 100 replicates for each scenario. SNPs were treated as categorical or continuous (including ancestry corrected SNPs). Haplotype based runs used HapMap 3 data: CHB JPT ( F ST,0.007) and CEU TSI (FST,0.004). Result and Conclusion: In simulated scenarios of extremely subtle structu re (F ST,[0.0009,0.002]), a population classification accuracy of 92.56% or greater was obtained, which was superior to ipPCA. Promising results to detect fine structure were also obtained in case of the HapMap populati ons.

26298,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses have recently identified hundreds of disease and expresssion associated genetic loci. However, finding the causal SNP in a locus remains challenging, especially for rare variants. Additionally, studies show that eQTL effects are often cell type and tissue specific, so there is a need for large numbers of cell type specific samples. We have previously shown that public RNAseq data from 9500 samples can be used to identify eQTL effects for 8,034 unique genes (Deelen et al., 2015). By analyzing pu blic RNAseq samples at an even larger scale, we will further increase our detection power. For this purpose we developed a pipeline to genotype and quantify gene ex pression for all RNAseq samples in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). In August we retrieved 33,000 samples from ENA, which includes, among others, eight tissues with each over 500 samples. Of the 33,000 quantified samples, 9,000 have been haplotype called and approximately 5,000 are of sufficient quality to continue with genotyping. This strictly quality controlled re use of freely available data will allow us to find many previously undetected allelic imbalanced SNPs and eQTLs. Mo reover, we expect the sample size to be large enough to also find tissue speci fic trans eQTLs and to contribute meaningfully in large scale trans eQTL or ASE studies. By overlapping eQTLs with other sources of SNP information, such as methylation QTLs and DNAseq QTLs, we can assist in the interpreta tion and prioritisation of likely pathogenic variants.",2016
26299,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the targeted sequencing of the protein coding regions of the human genome. It is routinely used in human gene tic studies and is a cost efficient method for identification of rare variants. Many bioinformatics pipelines have been developed for variant calling in WES data. The performance of these pipelines depends on the applied al gorithms and the implemented filter strategies. Given the complexity of large scale sequencing projects sample mix ups can interfere with the final results. Here we present GenCor, a tool for quality control of WES data by incorporation of array based genotyping. For assessing the quality of WES data, GenCor calculates the genotype con cordance between WES called variants and array based genotypes. For the evaluation of GenCor, WES data from five human DNA samples were used. Exome capture was performed using SureSelectXT Human AllExon V5. Lib raries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 with 2x125 bp. Raw data were pro cessed using the default BWA/GATK v.3.4 pipeline. The same set of samp les was processed on Infinium CoreExome 24 BeadChip that comprises >269,000 markers. In our data set no sample mix ups in WES preprocessing could be identified. For variant quality control, an average agreement of 10,135 variants per sample between WES variants and array based genotypes was observed. In total, 99% concordance of WES variants and array based genotypes were found. We recommend the incorporation of array based genotyping for im proved quality control in WES projects. The GenCor tool can also be applied to whole genome sequencing and is in principle compatible with genotype data from other genotyping platforms.",2016
26300,"The Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project has put tog ether a cohort of nearly 3000 cancer whole genomes from 47 projects co vering 20 different tissues. All of this data is processed in a homogeneous way, primarily to identify somatic mutations, allowing a wide range of analy ses within and across cancer types. However, as the sequencing was done by different sequencing facilities, with varying protocols and over a long period of time, careful attention must be paid to the quality of the genomes. To capture the quality of the genome sequences provided, the PCAWG Qua lity Control working group developed a framework to assess the quality and provide a succinct summary for PCAWG. The framework consists of five different measures of quality and a star rating system. The measures computed, for both the normal and the tumour genome, are the mean co verage, the evenness of coverage, somatic mutation calling power, paired reads mapping to different chromosomes, and paired reads of which one read fails to map. We summarised these into a star rating, with five stars representing the highest quality cancer genomes, passing all thresholds set for each measurement, and the rest on a descending scale in half star steps. The star rating system provides an easy to capture description of the quality of the sequences and flags problematic samples that should be eliminated from downstream use. We believe that this is an effective framework of qua lity measures for similar large scale studies that look to use sequences from different sources.",2016

Recent advances in next gene ration sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized genomics allowing physicians and scientists to examine patients at an unprecedented. Nowadays, the chal lenge with NGS technologies is the meaningful interpretation and analysis of data. Here we present an integrated solution that facilitates analysis and iden tification of potential causing mutations in rare and undiagnosed diseases from NGS based genome sequencing studies. All complex analysis steps are abstracted from the end user and results are presented in an intuitive and interactive way. The application annotates identified variants with over 50 properties, including descriptive statistics, prediction scores, frequencies from public databases, and information from disease related databases. An interactive filtering, prioritization, and classification mechanism is included offering new ways to analyze variants. Family studies can be collectively analyzed using sophisticated querying and filtering methods including gra phical representations of the relationships. The whole system is available as a web based application integrated into the Platomics platform, which offers powerful features for heterogeneous data handling of samples, and performing analysis runs using optimized parameter settings. As a proof of principle, using the new software we have analyzed targeted sequencing data in a cohort of patients with primary immunodeficiency dis orders (PIDs) of unknown molecular origin.

26303,"Introduction: Standard settings recommended by GATK Best Practices for WES pipelines produce a large number of low quality variants that need further filtering before down stream analyses. We describe a simple set of filters, which significantly improve variant quality metrics when added to the standard GATK VQSR procedure. Methods: Filtering options were compared on 3 WES germline datasets (Nextera Rapid Capture, HiSeq2500, PE75 125). Initially, a standard VQSR filtering was performed according to the current GATK Best Practices. Then this was complemented by reducing the padding allowance (to 10bp) and by adding two more hard filters for average DP (min 10x) and for QUAL (cor responding to TiTv>2).Results: are summarised in table Dataset A Dataset B Dataset C N of samples 512 42 45 Raw variants called by GATK HC (default settings) N of variants 794,680 268,147 300,757 TiTv (SNPs) 2.11 2.35 2.26 Standard VQSR filtering and padding (SNP TS 97%, INDEL TS 95%, padding 100bp) N of variants 552,535 227,766 247,421 TiTv (SNPs) 2.31 2.47 2.38 Standard VQSR filtering + set of custom filtersN of variants 239,100 90,332 108,698 TiTv (SNPs) 2.91 2.89 2.84 Plotting VQSLOD histograms was an informative addition to standard GATK practices. Clear multi modal VQSLOD distributions confirmed suitability of VQSR for SNP filtering. In contrast, VQSLOD distributions in INDELs showed that they cannot be successfully filtered by VQSR. Analysis of DP distribu tions made it clear that GATK recommended padding (100bp around tar gets) was arbitrary and excessive. Reducing it to 10bp removed a high num ber of poor quality variants, while preserving essential splice sites. Distribu tions and utility of other filters have been also explored. Conclusion: Three simple and intuitive hard filters added to the standard GATK VQSR procedure were sufficient to dramatically reduce the total num ber of variants and to improve their quality, making the metrics consistent with those expected in WES studies.

26304," The aim of the project was to characterise genome sequence variation in the Polish population and to combine it with collected clinical data for diagno stic and scientific applications. Whole genomes of 130 successfully aging Polish 90+ years old subjects were sequenced with a mean 30x coverage using the Illumina technology. An in house developed bioinformatic pipeline, including BWA, GATK and VEP , was applied to identify and annotate sequence variants. The genomic data were combined with a large set of clinical and biochemi cal records. Mitochondrial genomes were analysed and identified variants, in 780 positions when compared to rCRS, were added to the database. An analysis of structural and copy number variations was performed. Approximately 21.3 mln variants in the nuclear genome were found, inclu ding 16.9 million SNVs and 4.4 million indels. 72% of variants have been already present in the dbSNP database, 58% in the 1000 Genomes Project. Almost 4.0 mln novel SNVs and 2.5 mln novel indels were detected. The search for rare variants categorised by the Human Gene Mutation Database as disease causing (DM) yielded 764 variants with MAF<0.5%, which corre sponds to 6 distinct rare DM variants per each long lived person.

26305,"Introduction: Recent studies have shown that retrotransposition activity is not limited to germline cells, but is also typical for somatic cells. Most research on somatic retrotransposition are focused on brain, since retro element (RE) insertions are speculated to contribute to neurons plasticity. Whereas somatic RE insertions are very rare, their identification is com plicated even with the use of the most robust high throughput sequencing platforms. Thus, several hybridization and amplification based methods are used to target sequencing to selected subgroups of REs. However, none of these approaches could provide specific enrichment for somatic insertions. We developed a new normalization based method to enrich for somatic RE insertions. Materials and methods: Sequencing libraries were prepared from the DNA sample of 50000 nuclei from human brain cortex. First, the selective ampli fication with AluYa5 specific primer was performed. The amplicon was then subjected to two rounds of normalization using duplex specific nuclease. Se quencing data was analyzed by unique bioinformatics pipeline to generate the list of high confident somatic Alu insertions. Results: The use of genomic normalization increased the number of frag ments, flanking somatic Alu insertions in the sequenced sample by 20 fold, and the number of identified somatic insertions 6,5 fold. We identified 399 somatic insertions, 65 of which were present in more than one cell. Conclusions: The developed approach could significantly increase the effici ency of somatic REs identification in normal and malignant cells. Moreover, the use of molecular identifiers provides the direct estimation of the num ber of cells bearing a particular somatic insertion.

26306,"Introduction: The genetic component of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is not fully defined. Identification of rare variants through NGS analysis could help us to characterize a part of the missing heritability. Materials and Methods: To identify rare RA associated variants, we have analyzed exome sequences from 30 individuals (22 RA and 8 unaffected subjects) belonging to families with at least four cases of RA and/or other autoimmune diseases. Exons were captured with Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V5 kit and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer. After alignment, targeting of captured regions, variant calling and quality filte ring, we selected variants with allele frequency lower than 1% or absent in databases. We then performed association studies (Fisher test) between RA and pathways enriched in genes containing RA specific variants (identified with DAVID). Results: We identified 262030 rare variants carried by at least one indivi dual. In order to conduct pathway analysis, we selected variants present in all RA cases of a same family but absent in all other individuals (n,607 variants). The number of variants found in a particular family varied from 12 (2%) to 132 (22%). All the variants, spread across 580 genes, allowed us to identify 2 pathways significantly associated with RA: the cadherin si gnaling pathway (PFisher,4*10 3) and the focal adhesion pathway (pFis her,4*10 2).Conclusions: Analysis will be completed by taking into account the RA sta tus with or without other autoimmune diseases. Selected variants will be further validated by genotyping all available members of each family in or der to perform segregation analysis.",2016
26307,"Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies are a successful approach to study how genetic variation influences transcription. A current limitation in most eQTL studies is that they rely on annotated references to measure transcript abundance. While existing annotation is likely to be accurate for many human tissues, the complexity of gene expression and splicing in hu man brain implies that existing references are less accurate, and this view is supported by recent RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) analyses. In this study, we investigate regulation of transcribed intergenic regions in two brain tissu es: putamen and substantia nigra. We performed RNA seq on healthy post mortem brain tissues from the UKBEC dataset to identify and quantify tran scribed regions in a reference agnostic manner with Derfinder R package. After filtering steps, we combined the abundance of the intergenic transcri bed regions with genotype information to perform cis eQTL mapping ana lysis, detecting 1954 independent cis acting eQTL signals in putamen and 744 in substantia nigra. Finally, applying exon junction identification and co expression analysis, we investigated the independence of these regions from the nearest annotated genes. Using these approaches, we identified the existence of intergenic transcribed regions with high correlation with the nearest gene and shared eQTLs suggesting incomplete annotation of known genes. However, we also identified transcribed intergenic regions with inde pendent eQTLs suggesting the existence of novel regulated transcribed re gions. Both types of genomic regions represent as yet unexplored candidate regions for the identification of potentially pathogenic variation. Therefore, these findings are of direct relevance to the prioritisation of variants in cli nical diagnostics.",2016
26308,"Background: Clinical uses of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) are conti nuously expanding. However, unbiased systematic comparisons of perfor mance of NGS and Sanger sequencing is still lacking. We present a compara tive evaluation based on ~1.3% of the exome of a single individual. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leu kocytes. Sanger sequencing was performed for 258 genes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was done on the Illumina HiSeq2500 using the Nextera (FC 140 1006) capture kit (coverage 70x). WES data was analyzed using standard NGS analytic pipelines with predefined quality thresholds. Results: Sanger sequencing encompassed a total of 4,755 exons spanning 1,212,319 bp. The Nextera capture kit overlaps 99.4% of the coding se quence and 94% of the coding sequence including intron/exon boundaries (ÃÂ±8bp). Within this extended overlap region, 427 and 430 variants were detected by Sanger sequencing and NGS, respectively. 419 variants were concordant in both platforms. Of the eight variants identified by Sanger sequencing only, four were in genomic positions with Ã¢ÂÂ¤2 NGS coverage, and four were not detected despite good coverage. A total of 11 variants were identified only by NGS. Further results from buccal driven WES and the Agi lent (SureSelectQXT) Capture kit will be presented. Conclusions: The overall concordance between Sanger sequencing and NGS was 98.1% (419/427). On an exome wide scale, we extrapolate that ~150 200 variants would be discordant. Sanger only variants may be explained by NGS coverage failure, either specific or random. NGS only variants may reflect Sanger sequencing primer binding sites polymorphisms, or mo saicism. Single platform variants may also represent errors. Geneticists should be aware of these limitations.",2016

We present a methodology which combines multiple bioinformatic variant effect prediction tools to cre ate a single score used to identify potentially causal variants within a GWAS locus, to assist the SNP to gene mapping process. Materials and methods: A KNIME workflow was used to implement a novel variant scoring methodol ogy which combines the weighted effects of variants in a locus to produce a list of genes ranked in order of their predicted contribution to schizophrenia risk. Factors used to determine the weighted effect include a GWAS p value and a PHRED scaled CADD score. Results: TCF4 and FES, both strongly prob ably schizophrenia risk genes, appear within the top three positions in the ranked gene list, providing confidence that the method is useful in SNP to gene mapping and ranking associations. TCF4 has a large number of non coding variants in its vicinity, of which only rs143743309 scores highly, whereas FES has three highly scoring variants in its locus. Two of these are missense variants and one is a frameshift. In this case the frameshift variant is likely to be causal of the association at the locus. Conclusions: This meth odology will improve our understanding of what causes a locus to be associ ated with risk for complex genetic diseases, along with aiding in assessment of which gene is affected to allow us to approach drug target discovery with better validated genetic evidence.",2016

26312,"A structural variant is traditionally defined as a balanced or unbalanced ge netic rearrangement larger than 1kb but recent advances in genetic tech nology has enabled the detection of increasingly smaller rearrangements. In genetic diagnostic, currently applied techniques such as FISH and mi croarray studies have limited resolution. Massively parallel whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a promising technique that may be used to identify a large proportion of genomic structural variation in a single experiment. Ho wever, the detection of structural variants from WGS data is complicated by the vast amount of normal variants and reference errors and currently relies on using multiple variant callers, increasing the overall computational cost.

It contains a built in database function allowing the user to create local variant frequency databases, that may be used to filter out rare variants or detect variants that are common within a group. FindTranslocations goes beyond mere structural variant calling providing positional information for specific rearrangements to help make a correct interpretation of the clinical significance. We have used FindTranslocations in a validation set of 61 samples with previously identified clinically rele vant structural variants for which we have 30x WGS data.

26314,"The steady decrease in DNA sequencing costs facilitates the adoption of whole exome sequencing (WES) in clinical genetic testing settings. The identification of disease causing non synonymous coding rare variants from WES data is straightforward with currently available software and databa ses. However, the larger number of diseased individuals being genetically profiled using WES technology also increases the number of pathogenic variants that remain uncharacterized. This typically happens with variants that do not appear in curated databases and occur in non coding regions, often having a reduced penetrance in the population. To approach the iden tification of such pathogenic variants, approaches based on the integration of multiple annotation sources and filtering strategies are needed. One of the software platforms which can potentially offer the required flexibility and interoperability for this goal is the R/Bioconductor project and its DNA variant analysis infrastructure. On top of this infrastructure, we have built the VariantFiltering package with the aim of facilitating the annotation and filtering of both, coding and non coding genetic variants.

26315,"The ever increasing number of detected variants poses great challenge for routine diagnostics. Many attempts have been made to address this pro blem. Current approaches have several shortcomings: 1) genotypic and phenotypic information of patients is not captured comprehensively, 2) handling continuously changing variant information is not supported, and 3) manual data curation is required, which adds an unacceptable effort to the clinical routine. As a result, most data silos are either short lived or con tain outdated information. We evaluate the ALLEXES system that integrates variant annotation and curation into automated clinical processes from VCF file to the medical re port.

ALLEXES is a regulated medical device which is com pliant with harmonized international standards for medical device software and usability. The time required to evaluate clinically relevant variants was reduced si gnificantly compared to conventional annotation and reporting methods. Allele frequency and clinical information related to variants were available in near time to all participants in the ALLEXES network. Confidentiality of patient data was maintained. Existing and upcoming new regulation of genetic testing imposes increa singly strict rules on data handling.

However, we find large differences in demands on computing resources between the algorithms, which affects time and cost of analyses. In addition we have observed cases where there is good evidence for a variant position that is not recorded within the NIST reference variants set, indicating that while a valuable resource, it is not per fect.

26317,"Today one of the most prominent nomenclatures for reporting genomic variants is HGVS (http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/). According to this, variations are reported in alliance to their relative position in a reference sequence. This sequence can be a transcript, a chromosome, a database accession number, just to name few. The complexity of HGVS and the sub sequent non adherence from researchers makes the unique genomic posi tional identification of a variant, a cumbersome task. The most known tool that performs this task is mutalyer (www.mutalyzer.nl) that requires strict HGVS adherence and is able to identify only 43% of the variants reported in PAH, BRCA2 and HbVar databases. Here we present MutationInfo, a tool that performs various heuristics in order to perform the same task through less strict and fuzzy methods. These heuristics include (1) the lookup in databases like UCSC tables, Variant Effect Predictor, mutalyzez and LOVD, (2) the use of existing HGVS parsers like biocommon/hgvs, (3) correct for common HGVS mistakes and (4) perform BLAT alignment search of the fasta sequence in the reference assembly.

However in the current 1000G reference panel used for imputation there are few South European populations, which could hinder the imputation ef fort for populations close to the Mediterranean area.

We describe here a reference panel of 1852 haplotypes com posed by 20,829,813 SNPs and 2,490,202 INDELs selected after passing a strict QC: 43% of the selected sites are shared among all three Isolates, with 41 to 50% low frequency variants (MAF<1%) private to the INGI cohorts with respect to the EUR samples from 1000G Phase 3.We show that joining this panel with the standard 1000G reference, as well as with other references deriving from Northern European populations, increases imputationÃ¢ÂÂs accuracy of low frequency variants in Italian geno typed cohorts and possibly in other southern European cohorts: we noticed an 11% increment on average quality, using the merged INGI 1000G panel. This new resource will allow researchers to carry out imputation and GWAS for South European population in a more efficient way.",2016

One of the missions of ToMMo is to reveal a fine gene tic architecture of Japanese population to tackle the further genome wide associate study analysis by combining the knowledge, which is daily accu mulated in this project, e.g. questionnaire data, physiological data, medical treatment records and other omics data from serum, plasma and immorta lized lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: We have created the reference panel with one thou sand samples to cover MAF > 0.5% variants including short insertion, dele tion, and large structural variants in Japanese for constructing the Japanese whole genome reference panel (1KJPN). Currently we are constructing the second reference panel with two thousand samples (2KJPN). In these pa nels, to minimize the biases caused by the different equipment, protocol and bioinformatics analysis, we performed whole genome sequencing of thou sands samples with 30x high coverage using the HiSeq 2500 rapid run mode and analyzed by the same bioinformatics pipeline.

26320,"With the development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, the cost of sequencing has tremendously decreased, which promotes the appli cation of many sequencing methods in genetic studies, disease diagnose and so on. Especially, the whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a very promising method for geneticists because it can provide the comprehensive informa tion of genotypes in both coding and non coding regions, common and rare variants. However, the Big Data problem emerged at the same time due to the large scale dataset of WGS and currently no professional tool can solve it at all points. KGGSeq is a software platform for comprehensive downstream analysis of whole genome sequencing data. It is comprised of six functional modules: quality control, filtration, annotation, pathogenic prediction at va riants, pathogenic prediction at genes and statistical tests, which can meet almost all researchersÃ¢ÂÂ demands for WGS data analysis. The original bit block genotype storage mode can save 90% space and be much faster than existing tools. The gap filled annotation rescue over 1000 exonic variants that are ignored by other tools. Moreover, KGGSeq reads the compressed va riant call format (VCF) file by blocked GNU Zip format in parallel and parses the byte input stream directly. A heuristic algorithm is also used to facilitate the extracting information from text files. Finally, we compared KGGSeq with the existing tools by 1000 Genomes Project AFR panel, and KGGSeq always provided a more reasonable annotation and had a higher consistency with dbSNP database.

26321,"Dr. Ion ChiricutaÃ¢ÂÂ,, Cluj Napoca, Romania, 3Laboratory of Animal Biology, National Institute for Research and Development for Biology and Animal Nutrition, Balotesti, Romania. Introduction: Zearalenone (ZEA) is a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium spe cies, initially capturing the attention for its function of estrogenic mimic role. But the mechanism of this mycotoxin remains unclear. Therefore we evaluated the effect of 100ppb ZEA on transcriptomic pattern at duodenum level, first physical and chemical barrier in animals and humans. Material and methods: The alteration of gene expression pattern caused by Zea exposure at Sus scrofa duodenum was done using a custom microarray design (AMADID: 056850, Agilent technology). Data were analyzed with Features Extraction and Gene Spring. Then the data were extrapolated to human orthologues and analyzed in the context of human health using In genuity Pathways Analysis (IPA). The validation was done for six genes by qRT PCR and three cytokines by ELISA. Results: We had 1576 upregulated transcripts and 2446 downregulated transcripts as response to ZEA exposure at duodenum level considering as cut off value fold changeÃÂ±2 and p value<0.05. The qRT PCR and ELISA data confirmed the microarray results. The extrapolated human orthologues used for IPA analysis, revealing the activation of immune response, mitogen activated protein kinases, Toll like receptors and carcinogenic pathway. Conclusions. The effects of ZEA are complex at duodenum level, being con nected not only with the alteration of the immune response but also the ac tivation of the genes related to early colorectal carcinogenesis. The effects concerning the carcinogenic risk represent an important issue for future studies, particularly in the context of co occurrence with other mycotoxins or environmental risks factors, targeting multiple genetic alterations.

We have studied DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns in cells from human histologically confirmed uterine leiomyomas (ULs). We perfor med our study in non cultured cells because culture conditions may alter hydroxymethylation pattern. UL samples were obtained by surgery, suspen ded in collagenase type IV solution, then treated with hypotonic solution (0.9% sodium citrate + 0.55% potassium chloride) and fixed on slides with methanol:acetic acid, 1:1. 5 methylcytosine and 5 hydroxymethylcytosine were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. We compared hydroxymethylation patterns between ULs positive and ne gative for MED12 mutation, as well as between ULs excised in follicular and lutein phase. In all 22 ULs, we detected 3 types of nuclei: strongly hydro xymethylated, averagely hydroxymethylated, and non hydroxymethylated. Hydroxymethylation level was estimated visually by fluorescence intensity and then assessed in ImageJ. When comparing hydroxymethylation patterns between ULs positive and negative for MED12 mutation, no significant dif ference was detected (Unpaired t test with WelchÃ¢ÂÂs correction, P,0.7854). When comparing hydroxymethylation patterns between ULs excised in different menstrual phases, we found that 5 hydroxymethylcytosine level was significantly higher in ULs excised in follicular phase. We have shown a negative correlation between the 5 hydroxymethylcytosine level and the day of menstrual cycle at the time of UL excision (Spearman correlation co efficient, 0.473, P<0.05). DNA methylation was detected in all nuclei of all 22 ULs and difference among nuclei was not pronounced. Our results suggest that genome activity in ULs, determined by their hydro xymethylation pattern, varies during menstrual cycle. Supported by Russian Scientific Foundation (14 15 00737). A. V.T .&O.

As the differentiation and polarization of macrophages is followed by exten sive chromatin remodeling we checked whether transcription of cytokines is solely regulated by NF ÃÂºB (p50/p65) binding to proximal cis regulatory elements or involves enhancers and epigenetic events such as ADP ribosyla tion carried out by PARP1 within these regions. Materials and Methods: Human monocytes isolated from peripheral blood were differentiated and polarized with GM CSF, while human monocyte cell line THP1 with PMA. Expression of macrophage markers and cytokines was analyzed with real time PCR, association of NF ÃÂºB with chromatin and epi genetic modifications with ChIP , gene silencing with siRNA/shRNA. The in teraction of chromatin proximal and distal regulatory elements was studied with 3C method. Results: The differentiation of macrophages is accompanied by activation of distal regulatory elements and their ADP ribosylation inhibition of which enhances NF ÃÂºB (p50/p65) binding to chromatin and expression of cytoki nes. The silencing of linage determining factor PU.1, which enables NF ÃÂºB (p50/p65) interaction with enhancers restores the monocyte like gene ex pression. Moreover, inhibition of ADP ribosylation as well as PARP1 silen cing facilitates the chromatin looping resulting from enhancer interaction with cytokine promoters. Conclusions: ADP ribosylation of chromatin distal regulatory elements, undergoing activation during terminal macrophage differentiation, regula tes the interaction of NF ÃÂºB with these regions.

26324," Introduction: The importance of various classes of regulatory non coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in diseases is increasingly being recognized. We propose to perform a systematically profile, by RNA Seq approaches, of the lncRNAs and mRNAs in human ALS lymphocytes mutated, unmutated and controls with the aim of extending our knowledge on molecular alterations of tran scriptome and obtaining new data about its regulation. Materials and Methods: three cohort of ALS mutated patients (FUS, SOD1 and TARDBP) have been recruited and have been compared with healthy subjects and ALS sporadic (non mutated) patients. RNA libraries have been prepared by TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo Zero Gold kit (illumina). Results: 28 common genes were found differentially expressed in all groups compared to controls. About lncRNA, the data showed that in SOD1 group 32 linc were found differentially expressed, 18 in TARDBP , 5 in FUS and 8 in SALS group respectively. Discussion: Whole transcriptome analysis showed a general down regula tion in genes expression in all the studied groups. Moreover our prelimina ry data showed a comparable regulation between two groups positive for mutations in TARDBP and FUS, both involved in the same pathways, while a different profile arises from SOD1 and SALS groups. About lncRNAs the 56 lincsRNAs are down modulated by different extent in healthy donors and one SALS and one SOD1 sample. On the other side they are mainly up modulated in the other disease samples. This preliminary analysis seems to indicate that it is not possible, with this set of lincsRNAs, to discriminate between the different mutation states.",2016
26325,"Introduction: Using DNA methylation variants for predicting drug response represents an important application in pharmacoepigenetics. However, how these variants are influenced by the ethnic difference is still not studied sy stematically. Materials and Methods: We collected DNA methylation and gene expression data of primary tumor tissues of four cancer types (breast, colon, head and neck, and uterine corpus) from The Cancer Genome Atlas and lymphobla stoid cell lines from The International HapMap Project for African and Eu ropean ancestry populations. The methylation data were generated by the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and gene expression data were generated by RNA sequencing experiments. After data quality control, re gression models with batch effect adjustments were used to examine the association between CpG sites and ethnic population as well as to investi gate the relationship between differential methylation and gene expression. Results: We identified 264 CpG sites in drug response genes significantly associated with ethnicity. Among them, differential methylation in 19 CpG sites was highly related to the differential expression of the corresponding genes (e.g., SLC7A5 gene expression and its intronic CpG site cg27560818). A further comparison of the ethnicity associated CpG sites in cancers and HapMap datasets revealed significant methylation differences in both of glo bal distributions and individual CpG sites. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate ethnic effects on pharmacoepigene tics and the patterns may change by tissue types. These findings provide useful information for pharmaco response prediction in clinical practices and future pharmacoepigenetic research.

Matrix and transmembrane proteins play fundamental role in cellÃ¢ÂÂs live regulation. They are involved in maintenance of tissue architectu re, signals transduction, wound healing, adhesion and play significant role in tumor development. Materials and methods. We evaluated epigenetic regulation of 12 laminin encoding genes (LAMA1, LAMA2, LAMA3A, LAMA3B, LAMA4, LAMA5, LAMB1, LAMB2, LAMB3, LAMC1, LAMC2, LAMC3), 8 integrins (ITGA1, ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGA4, ITGA6, ITGA7, ITGA9, ITGB1), 2 nidogens (NID1,NID2 ), the dystrogly can gene DAG1 and 10 matrix metalloproteinases encoding genes (MMP2, MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17, MMP21, MMP23B, MMP24, MMP25, MMP28 ) and 4 genes of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3, TIMP4) in 186 samples of breast cancer, 186 paired adjacent nonmalignant samples and 6 samples of normal mammary gland from auto psy by methylation sensitive PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Results. Promoters of the LAMA3A, LAMB2, LAMB3, LAMC2, MMP14, MMP21, TIMP1, TIMP4 genes were constitutively methylated in breast tissues. Pro moters of 15 genes have demonstrated abnormal methylation in BC (table). In small number of cases genes LAMA1, LAMA2, LAMB1, NID1, ITGA4, ITGA9 were methylated not only in BC, but also in paired adjacent nonmalignant samples. Conclusions.

26327,"Introduction: Polyalanine expansions in the 20 residues region of the hu man PHOX2B gene, a key regulator of autonomic nervous system develop ment, lead to Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome, a neurodeve lopmental disorder characterised by a failure in the autonomic control of breathing. Elongation of the alanine stretch leads to a protein with altered DNA binding, transcriptional activity, nuclear localisation, and cytoplasmic aggregates formation. Previous studies support the idea that PHOX2B mu tant proteins display both loss and new toxic gain of function, resulting in a dominant negative effect. As PHOX2B forms homodimers and heterodi mers with its paralogue PHOX2A in vitro, we tested the hypothesis that the dominant negative effect of the mutated proteins are due to non functional interactions with the wild type protein or PHOX2A. Moreover we investiga ted the effects of the longest polyalanine expansions on the homeodomain mediated nuclear import. Material and methods: To study hetero and homo dimerisation we used co immunoprecipitation assay, and mammalian two hybrid system. Deletion analysis and immunocytochemistry were used to study the consequences of alanine expansion on the sub cellular localisation. Results and conclusions: Our findings show that PHOX2B forms homodi mers, heterodimerise weakly with mutated proteins, exclude the direct involvement of the polyalanine tract in dimer formation, and indicate that mutated proteins retain partial ability to form heterodimers with PHOX2A, with a possible role in the pathogenic process. Moreover our data show that the expanded C terminus interferes with nuclear import process. These re sults provide novel insights into the effects of the alanine tract expansion on PHOX2B folding and activity. Funded by Telethon foundation Grant n. GGP13055",2016
26328,"Introduction: Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS, MIM 209880) is a rare neonatal disease characterized by abnormal ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, owing to failure of autonomic respi ratory control. Frameshift mutations (5%) and polyalanine triplet expan sions (95%) have been detected in the coding region of the transcription factor PHOX2B, responsible for the proper development and function of the autonomic nervous system. Consistent with its role as transcriptional regu lator, it is reasonable to suppose that transcriptional dysregulation might be an important mechanism of CCHS pathogenesis. Current research on treatments of CCHS is focused on counteracting the toxic effects of the mu tated PHOX2B protein, and stemming from the fortuitous observation that progestin Desogestrel can relief some symptoms of the disease, by a not yet identified molecular mechanism,lead us to identify new PHOX2B target ge nes as potential pharmacological targets for alternative molecules without contraceptive effects. Methods: Identification of PHOX2B regulated genes has been carried out by ChIP seq analysis in IMR32 cells. The expression of PHOX2B target ge nes will be selectively validated by comparing wild type and CRISPR CAS9 Knocked down PHOX2B expressing IMR32 cells. Results and conclusion: Gene Ontology analysis of the set of peak associated genes identified several enriched terms in categories consistent with PHO X2B role during autonomic nervous system development and maintenance. Further, we show that Desogestrel enhanced the expression of some rele vant PHOX2B target genes in a promoter specific manner, by acting on the activity of the wild type as well as mutant protein.

The aim of this study was to analyze coexpression in the whole genome under acute gliadin exposure, and to identify regulator elements that could underlie the se alterations in the context of CD. Materials and Methods: We identified differentially coexpressed genes in an expression microarray from gluten free diet (GFD) CD biopsies cultu red with/out gliadin. We performed miRNA and transcription factor (TF) enrichment analyses and selection of candidate regulators. Expression of candidates was measured in clinical samples and the activation of one of the TFs (IRF1) was further characterized in C2BBe1 cells upon gliadin chal lenge. Binding of IRF1 to the in silico predicted targets was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).Results: Two miRNAs and 3 TFs were selected as final candidates. One miRNA was underexpressed while 2/3 TFs were overexpressed in active disease. IRF1 was overexpressed at a protein level in the nuclear fraction of the C2BBe1 cells after gliadin exposure, although we did not see notable differences in the immunofluoresce assay. Finally, the IRF1 ChIP experiment performed in cells showed altered binding upon gliadin exposure in genes that were differentially coexpressed/expressed in acute CD. Conclusions: Gliadin alters coexpression in CD. Moreover, our pipeline was able to identify regulators that could be relevant to disease. Particularly, IRF1 showed differential expression in patients and altered binding to se veral targets upon gliadin challenge in C2BBe1 cells, suggesting a general effect of gluten in physiological conditions.",2016

Diseases can cause GC enrichment of cfDNA pool (cerebral atherosclerosis, heart attack, rheumatic arthritis, cancer). Our aim was to investigate the exact mechanism of cfDNA cell in teraction. Materials and methods: GC rich DNA fragments were obtained by inserting the CpG rich fragment of rDNA in a vector (pBR322). mRNA was isolated from different types of human cells (MSCs, HUVECs, PBMCs, HELFs) using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Gene expression level was assessed using RT PCR (TBP and GAPDH as internal standards). Statistics was perfor med using Statgraphics software. Results: GC rich DNA plasmid (50 ng/ml, 3h incubation) increases TLR9 and its adapter MyD88 level in human MSCs, HUVECs, PBMCs and HELFs (TLR9 3 ; 2,5 ; 2,8 ; 3,7 fold and MyD88 3 ; 2,5 ; 2,8 ; 3,7 fold, respectively). GC rich DNA plasmid activates NFkB signaling pathway in these types of cells, NFkB translocates to the nucleus and genes of NFkB signaling pathway: MAP3K1, MAP4K4, NFKB1A, REL, IKBKB, RelA (p65), NFRKB, NFKB1 and NFKB2 increase 2 5,5 fold. Expression of NFkB target genes TNF, IL1B, IL8, IL6, TNFRSF1A increase 2 4 fold in all types of cells.

26333,"Introduction: The treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been greatly revolutionized by the development of imatinib mesylate (IM). De spite high efficiency of IM, acquired resistance has been observed in a si gnificant proportion of patients. Aside mutations of the BCR/ABL gene, downstream factors may contribute to treatment failure. Accumulating evi dence for aberrant expression of miR 451 in several types of human cancer suggests that it may be play a critical role in treatment response to IM in patients with CML. Materials and Methods: 29 responders (molecular remission) and 30 non responders were included in this study. Both miR 451 expression and MYC transcript expression were measured by real time quantitative RT PCR as say. Analysis of relative expression of miR 451 and MYC between groups was calculated according to the 2 ÃÂCt method. Putative targets of miR 451 were predicted by TargetScan and Microcosm. In addition, we used Pach al gorithm to identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in promoter region sequences of miR 451. Results: Down regulation of the expression of miR 451 was observed in non responders as compared to responders. Furthermore, in silico analy ses identified MYC as a potential target of miR 451 which in turn may regu lates miR 451 expression as a transcription factor. Increased level of MYC was also detected in resistant patients when compared to optimal imatinib responders. Combination of these findings suggests that there may exist a feedback loop between miR 451 and MYC. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that miR 451/MYC mini circuitry may act as a potential therapeutic target and disruption of suggested regulatory loop could help to improve CML therapy.",2016

We hypothesized that this could partially result from epi genetic modifications of DNA repair genes, resulting in altered gene expres sion in those tissues. In the present study we searched for gene specific DNA methylation levels of a panel of DNA repair genes in peripheral blood cells of AD and healthy controls. Materials and Methods: In a first step blood DNA of a subgroup composed by late onset AD (LOAD) patients and healthy matched controls was screened with a commercially DNA methylation array able to evaluate the methyla tion levels of a panel of 22 genes involved in major DNA repair pathways. We then applied the cost effective PCR based methylation sensitive high resolution melting technique (MS HRM), in order to evaluate the promoter methylation levels of some of the major DNA repair genes, namely OGG1, PARP1 , MRE11A , BRCA1, MLH1, and MGMT in blood DNA from a wider co hort. Results: Both approaches showed that all the investigated genes were large ly hypomethylated in LOAD and control blood DNA, and no difference bet ween groups was observed. Conclusions: In summary, the present investigation suggests that there is no impairment in promoter methylation of the investigated DNA repair genes in blood DNA of AD patients.

Therefore, the esta blishment of methylation profile in ADHD patients is important to guide the research key epigenetic factors in this disorder. DNA methylation profile was performed using DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes of 13 ADHD patients (9 boys and 4 girls, ages 06 14) by Illumina Infinium HumanMe thylation450 BeadChip. We analyzed the array data using specific packages within the environment R and used the BRB ArrayTools to make the cluster. We performed two analyzes: a comparison between boys and girls and a differential analysis of all the samples. In the comparison between boys and girls we obtained 249 probes with ÃÂÃÂ² +0.20. In the differential analysis of all the samples, we selected 3,348 pro bes using SD > 0.1 as selection criteria. We used the ÃÂ² values these 3,348 selected probes to make the samples cluster, which showed a strong sepa ration of patients into two groups: the first formed of 4 girls and the second formed of 9 boys. Thus, we suggested that it is quite probable that differences in DNA methyla tion profiles of boys and girls may be associated with the genetic basis of ADHD.

We declared as statistical significant those associations with p values that fulfill Bonferroni criteria (<1.17E 07).Results: We discovered two CpGs located in two genes (PEX5 and HOXA3) related to cholesterol efflux capacity; and one CpGs located in GABRR1 rela ted to the proinflammatory index. These CpGs explained 4.94% and 0.83% of the variability of the cholesterol efflux capacity and of the proinflammato ry index, respectively. Conclusions: We have identified three potential loci associated with HDL functionality located in the genes PEX5, HOXA3 and GABRR1. Additional studies are warranted to validate these findings in other populations.",2016
26337,"DNA methylation and the localization and post translational modificati on of nucleosomes are interdependent epigenetic factors contributing to the generation of distinct phenotypes from genetically identical cells. The BLUEPRINT Epigenome project has produced DNA methylation maps (who le genome bisulfite sequencing) and histone modification maps (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for six post translational modifications) for nearly 200 samples, covering a range of immune system effector cells and the cancers that arise from them. Here we analyze the global evolution of DNA methylation patterns and their relationship with stably positioned nucleosomes during lineage commitment and maturation of 112 hemato poietic samples. The innate and adaptive lineages of the human immune system show distinct trends, both globally and in relation to consistently positioned nucleosomes, including a progressive loss of methylation in developing lymphocytes. Cancer samples from the two lineages become further polarized, suggesting the involvement of opposing lineage specific epigenetic mechanisms. Although DNA methylation is generally restricted to CG dinucleotides, we note the consistent occurrence of non CG methylation in naive T lympho cytes and uncommitted hematopoietic progenitor cells, at levels similar to those seen in neurons and stem cells. We also examine sporadic occurrences of localized non conversion in a few samples, suggesting the possibility of dense exon specific non CG methylation. We anticipate broad utility for this resource as a basis for further comparative analyses.

26338,"Introduction: The aim of our pilot study is to analyze correlation of changes in the levels of methyltransferases in nuclear extracts with different mor phological characteristics of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: 21 breast cancer patients and 10 healthy controls were selected for the study. The levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a and H3K4 were measured in nuclear extracts of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Nuclear extracts were prepared using nuclear extraction kit (Abcam). ELI SA based DNMTs assay kits (Abcam) were used to measure the amount of DNMT1/3a and H3K4 methyltransferases. Three pathologists performed blind assessment of tumorsÃ¢ÂÂ morphological and phenotypic characteristics. Results: The results showed that the level of DNMT1 was highest in the con trol group but didnÃ¢ÂÂt correlate with the grade. The level of DNMT1 increased together with the level of Estrogen receptor expression. DNMT3a was found in highest level in Grade III cancer group, followed by Grade II and Grade I groups. In the control group the level of DNMT3a was also rather low. An opposite pattern was seen for H3K4 methyltransferase. DNMT3a level was higher in larger tumors, while the level of H3K4 methyltransferase was lo west. In HER2neu positive cases levels of both DNMT1 and DNMT3a were increased, while H3K4 methyltransferase was decreased. Conclusions: This primary study showed that there are some changes in methyltransferase levels in PBMC from breast cancer patients. Continuing observation is planned to specify this and possibly identify an additional diagnostic/prognostic feature for breast cancer. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

Thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy worldwide with the most common histological type papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) is a hallmark for many types of cancers. We aim to profile tumor samples and evaluate the methylation status for 22 TSG promoters (APC, BRCA1, CDH1, CDH13, CDKN2A, DAPK, ESR1, FHIT , GSTP1, MGMT , MLH1, NEUROG1, PDLIM4, PTEN, RARB, RASSF1, RUNX3, SOCS1, TIMP3, TP73, VHL, WIF1), to correlate methylation level with bio logical phenotypes. We performed a methylation analysis (Human TSG EpiTect Methyl II Signa ture PCR Array Qiagen) in PTC samples compared with normal thyroid tis sue. Preliminary, we evaluated the promoter methylation for TP73, PDLIM4, WIF1 genes in 120 patientÃ¢ÂÂs samples, consisting of 60 PTC and follicular adenoma specimens and their adjacent normal tissue, with qMS PCR using bisulphite treated DNA samples. The methylation percentage was found to be increased in PTC samples than control (p<0.001). Higher methylation percentage (MP) values were found for TP73 (85.16%) BRCA1 (76.94%), WIF1 (75.8%), PDLIM4 (67.74%).The methylation level was correlated with tumor grade. TP73 gene promo ter methylation seem to be a characteristic for follicular adenoma samples and PTC follicular variant. Methylation of PDLIM4 gene promoter was found from the incipient state of neoplasia, also found in a higher percentage in patients with PTC and PTC follicular variant. These results illustrate the involvement of epigenetic alterations in thyroid oncogenesis. We consider that the TSG promoterÃ¢ÂÂs methylation profile may be a starting point for diagnosis, prognosis of PTC. Acknowledgements to PCCA 135/2012.",2016
26340,"Introduction: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), one of the most common autoinflammatory disorders, is an autosomal recessively inherited disea se. Phenotypic heterogenity is very important in FMF. Different modifier factors such as epigenetic factors need to be investigated for their role in influencing the phenotype variability seen in FMF patients. Alteration of microRNAs (miRNAs) in biological processes can lead many disorders in cluding inflammatory disorders. We aimed to explore the potential involve ment of miRNAs in pathogenesis of FMF. Materials and Methods: The expression levels of miRNAs in total blood, ob tained from healthy controls, patients (homozygotes and heterozygotes) and healthy heterozygotes, were compared with GeneChip miRNA 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). The raw data was analyzed by Multi Experiment Viewer (MeV) and miRNA target genes were determined in miRWalk and clustered in DA VID v6.7 through BioCarta and KEGG pathway maps. Results: MiR 20a 5p, miR 197 3p, let 7d 3p, miR 574 3p were significantly differentially expressed in homozygous patients and heterozygotes patients. Array results were validated using qPCR. All these miRNAs were found to be known regulators in TGF beta and Toll like receptor signaling pathway, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton regulation. Conclusions: We showed for the first time that there are differentially ex pressed miRNAs which may target mRNAs clustered in inflammatory pa thways such as cytokine secretion, apoptosis and cell migration. Thus our findings provide initial evidence that miRNAs may play role in FMF patho genesis.

26341,"Podocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells outlining the glomeru lar vessels. FOXC2 is a transcription factor essential for inducing podocyte differentiation. We hypothesize that the transcription of FOXC2 and conse quently the differentiation of podocytes, can be controlled by miR 548c 5p through a predicted 21nt long target region located 8kb upstream the FOXC2 transcription start point. By using luciferase reporter constructs, it became apparent that the DNA target site acts as a conventional miRNA binding site. During early differentiation of AB8/13 human podocytes, miR 548c 5p mimics effectively diminished endogenous FOXC2 levels, while a more dynamic model of this interaction was observed when investigating other time points, suggesting a dependence on target site availability. There fore, the role of this miRNA target site as a distal enhancer/repressor ele ment was investigated using Chromosome Conformation Capture. Evidence indicates a correlation between podocyte differentiation events and the interaction levels between the miRNA target site and the FOXC2 proximal promoter regions.

26342,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR: OMIM 142623), the most common neurocri stopathy in humans (1:5000 newborns), is attributed to a failure of neural crest cells to migrate, proliferate, differentiate or survive in the bowel wall during embryonic Enteric Nervous System (ENS) development. This process requires a wide and complex variety of molecules and signaling pathways which are activated by transcription factors. Although some genes involved in this pathology are well characterized, many aspects remain poorly un derstood. In this study we aimed to identify novel genes implicated in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung disease. For this goal, through TaqMan Gene Expression Assays, a differential expression study was performed on a set of genes involved in human stem cells pluripotency as well as on a set of genes encoding transcription factors that participate in different stages of the colonization process. These assays were conducted on Neurosphere like bodies and gut tissues from both HSCR and control individuals. A total of eleven genes resulted to present statistically significant differential expres sion among patients and controls. Five of them are implicated in cell proli feration and migration (NESTIN, FN1, LAMC1, PECAM, and SEMA3A), four encode for transcription factors (CDYL, MEIS1, STAT3 and PAX6) and one encodes for a de novo methyltransferase (DNMT3B). This approach allowed us to characterize the precursors of human ENS and to identify a group of excellent candidate genes to be implicated in the ENS development and in the onset of HSCR.

26343,"Introduction: Transcription factor (TF) target site interactions are the ele mentary molecular events of gene regulation. Identification of SNPs disrup ting such interactions and having an effect on chromatin state may shed light on the mechanistic principles of regulatory genetic variation. Methodology: We developed a discovery pipeline for extracting SNPs that abolish, create, or significantly change the affinity of predicted TF binding sites. Input is a comprehensive variant list, a reference genome plus a set of position weight matrices defining the binding specificity of TFs. Output is a subset of SNPs along with their predicted effects on TF binding. This sub set is then used in GWAS studies to identify various kinds of cis regulatory QTLs. Unlike other approaches, our pipeline can identify de novo created TF binding sites not present in the reference genome. Results: To test the pipeline we selected 48 TFs and extracted a list of 248,676 SNPs affecting TF binding. As phenotypes we used ChIP seq data from Waszak et,al.

26344,"Introduction. Imprinting disorders (IDs) are syndromes characterized by (epi)genetic alterations affecting imprinted genomic regions. Most of ID pa tients show epimutations limited to the disease specific locus, but several exhibit multilocus methylation imprinting disturbances (MLIDs). MLID may account for the variable presentation and the phenotypic overlap between IDs, that make clinical diagnosis often difficult and highlight the need for a reliable method for methylation analysis at multiple imprinted loci. Materials and Methods. We developed a quantitative methylation test by MassARRAY approach to detect alterations at 12 imprinted regions in 15 pre and post natal patients with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and 25 patients with pseuodohypoparathyroidism type 1 (PHP1), previous ly diagnosed by pyrosequencing or MLPA. The MassARRAY methylation platform has been set up on 40 normal controls to define methylation ran ges at each analyzed CpG site. Results. 33% of BWS patients showed MLID, with loss of methylation at ma ternally imprinted loci only. PHP1 patients exhibited both gain and loss of methylation at maternally/paternally imprinted loci and MLID was more frequent in patients with complex clinical presentation. Conclusions. MassARRAY platform allows a higher frequent detection of MLID in ID patients compared to literature data, thanks to the accurate analysis of several imprinted genes. In BWS patients the detection of MLID confined to maternally imprinted loci, suggests alterations in trans acting factors involved in the methylation establishment/maintenance in the oo cyte. Next generation sequencing is ongoing to identify alterations at these factors. Conversely, MLID patterns in PHP1 patients suggest different/mul tiple causative mechanisms.

26345,"Spermatogenesis is a differentiation process characterized by extremely marked chromatin and cellular changes leading to the highly specialized sperm cell. Histone H4 hyperacetylation (acH4) during spermatogenesis is involved in gene activation and in sperm chromatin remodelling in the final stages, and therefore may affect the imprinting of the mature sperm cell. Thus, we hypothesized that acH4 expression pattern during sperma togenesis is different between normal and pathological samples. We used a semi quantitative approach to compare both the intensity and distribution of acH4 immuno detection in testicular biopsies (n,23) with normal and abnormal spermatogenesis (hypospermatogenesis, spermatogenic arrest and Sertoli cell only Syndrome). Immunofluorescence was used to further localize acH4 in ejaculated sperm cells. AcH4 immuno detection was high in spermatogonia, decreased in spermatocytes, and increased again reaching a maximum in elongating spermatids in normal spermatogenesis. The immu no detection of acH4 in all spermatogenic cell types decreased in patients with hypospermatogenesis or spermatogenic arrest, but increased in the presence of tubular atrophy and fibrosis. Stronger acH4 immuno detection was observed in Sertoli cells from patients with Sertoli cell only Syndrome (absence of germinal cells). The localization of acH4 in the mature sperm nucleus indicates the acetylation of retained H4 histones. In conclusion, we found that acH4 is deregulated in patients with altered spermatogenesis. The results from this study implicate acH4 involvement in the remodelling of chromatin during the histone to protamine transition through spermato genesis which may play a role in chromatin imprinting anomalies.

26346,"Recent studies have begun to implicate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as regulators of many important biological processes. In this study we have identified a novel lncRNA (lnc13), harboring a celiac disease associated SNP block, that helps maintain expression of certain inflammatory genes at ba sal levels. Lnc13 regulates gene expression by binding to a member of the family of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprote ins (hnRNPs) that interacts with the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex. Under inflammatory conditions, the level of lnc13 is decreased, thereby re moving the repressive effect of lnc13 bound to the hnRNP and enhancing the inflammatory environment. Interestingly, lnc13 levels are significantly decreased in celiac disease intestinal mucosa suggesting that downregulati on of lnc13 contributes to the inflammation seen in celiac disease. Further more, the lnc13 risk variant binds the hnRNP less efficiently, thus helping to explain the contribution of the SNPs to celiac disease and showing a new mechanism of gene expression control by a SNP located in a non coding transcript.",2016

Introduction: Pancreatic cancer represents an aggressive disease, being the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths, and its early detection remains a major challenge. Development and progression of pancreatic adenocarcino ma (PDAC) involve gradual accumulation of various genetic and epigenetic alterations. Despite the accumulating evidence that links long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression to neoplastic transformation, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in PDAC. The aim of this study is to analyse lncRNAs expression profiles in pancreatic cancer. Materials and Methods: From 5 paired samples (normal/pancreatic ade nocarcinoma) total RNA was obtained and lncRNAs expression levels were assessed using Human LncProfiler qPCR Array Kit (System Biosciences). For lncRNAs validation qRT PCR was used. Results: 42 lncRNAs presented significant differences in expression levels between PDAC tissues and corresponding normal tissues (> 2 fold change; p < 0.05). LncRNAs expression profiling showed that 27 were significantly upregulated (among them: Alpha 280, E2F4 antisense, Evf1, Evf2, Hoxa11as, Tsix, Meg3, Malat1) while 15 were significantly downregulated (EgoA, SRA, Lust, PCGEM1, Gomafu, and Tmevpg1). In order to validate the results, two lncRNAs (Malat1 and Meg3) were selected and expression levels were eva luated for 30 sample pairs.

26348,"Introduction: Cutaneous malignant melanoma has a high propensity to spread throughout the body causing a high mortality. There is cumulative evidence that miRNAs, which control many pathological processes acting as gene expression regulators, mediate melanoma invasion and metastasis. Here, we sought to investigate the role of miR 205 in governing patient clini cal outcome at the time of primary tumor as a way to differentiate patients with higher risk. Materials and Methods: We obtained frozen primary human melanoma samples from 65 patients. We selected miR 205 as a good metastasis related miR. We determined miR 205 expression of these primary tumors by miR NA RT qPCR and these results were correlated with the clinical outcome. Results: miR 205 expression was detected in all cases. 49 cases did not metastatize and 16 cases metastatized (24,6%) to distant organs. Clini cal follow up ranged from 10 to 134 months (mean 88 months). From our data, miR 205 was differentially expressed between metastatic versus non metastatic primary melanomas. It was down regulated in the former com pared with the latter. Furthermore, the cumulated survival stratified by miR 205 expression is significantly different between both primary melanoma groups (Kaplan Meier curves, Log rank test).Conclusions: The miR 205 expression in primary melanoma tumors is able to segregate patients regarding their metastatic ability. Altogether, these findings unravel a key role for miR 205 in distant metastatic melanoma. Given its critical role in metastatic melanoma, miR 205 holds potential as therapeutic target and biomarker.

26350,"Introduction: Nasal polyposis, which is originated from nose and parana sal sinus mucosa, is a chronic inflammatory disease. It has been accepted a hereditary predisposition because of the increased frequency in some families. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAMTS) genes regulate the structures and functions of different tissues. They are associated with angiogenesis and tumorigenesis, and may therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps. The objective of this study was to show the expression levels of ADAMTS 5, ADAMTS 8 and ADAMTS 9 gene in nasal polyposis and make a contribution to the etiopa thogenesis. Materials and Methods: The study included a total of 48 subjects, of whom 34 patients suffered from nasal polyposis and 14 healthy tissues were con trol subjects. After histopathological diagnosis, 1x1 cm of nasal polyposis tissue samples used for gene expression studies. The levels of ADAMTS 5, ADAMTS 8 and ADAMTS 9 gene expressions were measured from each sample belonging to the patient and control groups by real time PCR. Results: We detected an important decrease of expression levels of the ADAMTS 5 and ADAMTS 9 genes in nasal polyp tissues. Expression levels of ADAMTS 8 gene in nasal polyp tissues were similar when compared with the normal nasal tissues. Conclusion: This is the first time an association has been found between ADAMTS and nasal polyposis. We concluded that ADAMTS 5 and ADAMTS 9 genes may play an important role in the development of nasal polyposis. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 367Back to index",2016

26352,"Introduction: A growing literature suggests that oxytocin pathways (oxt + receptors) must have played a key role in the emergence of human sociality and communication. We wish to provide genetic evidence for this by exploi ting recent discoveries in the domain of archaic human genomics. Materials and Methods: We have relied on robust findings in the genetic foundations of language (FOXP2 CNTNAP2 pathway), an extensive database oxytocin related search (Pubmed), predictive protein interaction program (String 10), and results from archaic human genomics. Results: We put forth a sapiens specific change (compared to archaic hu mans) affecting the functional connection between OXT , POU3F2, FOXP2, YY1, and CNTNAP2. POU3F2 is known to be necessary for oxytocin cell diffe rentiation. Crucially, a DNase I hypersensitive site accelerated in the human lineage on Chromosome 6 lies in a gene desert 300 kb from POU3F2, which regulates FOXP2 in a sapiens unique manner. Two of the substitutions in this site strengthen a putative YY1 transcription factor binding site. YY1 has been implicated in one of the variants of the CNTNAP2 5Ã¢ÂÂ promoter as risk factors for autism spectrum disorders. YY1 is among the top 10 enriched transcription factors in differentially methylated regions in sapiens vs. ar chaic humans. YY1 binds in a methylation sensitive fashion to an insulator sequence within Peg3. Peg3 knockouts show reduced hypothalamic oxyto cin neurons.

Differences in RE sequences can strongly impact p53 transac tivation capacity and occur even between closely related species. Although p53 functions have been studied in a wide range of species, not much is known about the p53 mediated transcriptional signature in Danio rerio. Materials and Methods: We applied an array of computational approaches followed by functional studies to map and characterize p53 binding sites (BS) in the Danio rerio genome. Results: A total of 3,033 hits were found in the zebrafish genome. First, 10 predicted p53REs were selected according to defined series conditions and functionally validated by performing luciferase based assays.

Next, expression level of can didate genes associated to the predicted p53RE in ZF embryos treated with both R roscovitine or injected with p53 antisense morpholino (p53MO), were qPCR profiled, detecting a symmetrical change of mRNA levels in 7 out of 10, respectively. Based on the first 10 experimentally validated Danio rerio p53RE, 21 addi tional putative p53BS were then selected through a position specific scoring matrix, and subsequently validated by qPCR.

26354,"Introduction: Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. To date, mutations in the GBA gene, encoding the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, are considered the main genetic risk factor for PD, and glucocerebrosidase downregulation was demonstrated to have a crucial role in PD. We previously described a miRNA mediated regulatory circuit linking GBA and its pseudogene (GBAP1) expression. GBA/GBAP1 resulted co expressed in most tissues (ratio: 2 to 200). Furthermore, we demonstrated that GBAP1 levels are downregulated by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. GBA and GBAP1 share a similar genomic structure, characterized by a pro ximal (P1) and a distal (P2) promoter; no data on the expression regulation of GBAP1 as well as on the relative contribution of the two promoters are available so far. Methods: We cloned 1kb of the 4 promoters in a luciferase vector and pro duced serial 5Ã¢ÂÂ deletion constructs for each promoter. These plasmids were transfected in different cell lines. Results: At difference with what observed for endogenous transcripts, we demonstrated that P2 promoters are stronger than P1s for both genes, and that GBA and GBAP1 promoters have comparable activities. Two Transcrip tion Factor EB (TFEB) binding sites resulted the main drivers of P1s tran scriptional activity, with TFEB overexpression having a stronger up regula ting effect on GBA transcripts. Conclusions: Besides differences in epigenetic regulation, not faithfully mo deled in our system, NMD is likely to be the major determinant of the relati ve expression of GBA/GBAP1 transcripts.

26356,"Introduction and Methods: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease that affects ~1% of adults in the UK. Genetic factors account for ~60% of the variation in disease susceptibility and are well de fined through a strong history of genetic studies. As is common for complex genetic disorders, the majority of the ~100 loci associated with rheumato id arthritis susceptibility lie outside of protein coding regions. How these loci contribute to susceptibility is largely unknown. Bioinformatic analysis of susceptibility loci was used to identify and prioritise loci that overlap long non coding RNA: a class of molecules that have been demonstrated to occupy various important functions. Loci situated some distance from the nearest protein coding genes, and where a physical, DNA looping interaction was observed from in house generated Capture Hi C data were prioritised. Nine potentially interesting candidates were subjected to expression analy sis, performed using the Nanostring platform, aiming to identify expression in relevant stimulated and unstimulated tissues and cell types, in both total and nuclear RNA. Results and Conclusion: As is typical for long non coding RNA, expression was generally very low and highly tissue specific. This analysis identifies a selection of long non coding RNA that will be the focus of future work to investigate the impact of disease risk genetic variance on both the long non coding RNAs and downstream targets. Of particular interest are lnc IRF8 5 and lnc RPLP1 2, which are expressed in synovial tissue, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, situated over 300kb from their target gene and containing variants significantly associated with RA.",2016
26357,"Lack of potential diagnostic or prognostic markers for sepsis makes it dread ful disease, which holds the highest mortality. Genetic studies have shown that the type of infecting organism, outcome of infections and mortality can be predetermined by analyzing an individualÃ¢ÂÂs genome. Genetic/epigenetic studies build up hope for newer diagnostic/prognostic methods in the treat ment of sepsis, as well as understanding of its pathogenesis. In our study we have analyzed DNA methylation changes in 22 genes, connected to cellular stress and toxicity. We collected blood samples from 21 surgical patients with sepsis ending in exitus lethalis and 20 control healthy individuals. The promoter methylation status of 22 genes was analyzed using The Human Stress & Toxicity Pathway FinderEpiTect Methyl II Signature PCR Array. Seven genes were successfully ana lyzed in all samples CSTB, DNAJC15, Gadd45a, Gadd45G, Prdx2, Tp53 and Xpc. The average methylation level for these genes in control subjects was respectively 0, 0.09, 0, 0, 0.07, 0 and 0. In patients with sepsis it was as fol lows 0.025, 0.18, 0.1, 0.22, 0.11, 0,1 and 0.06. The highest increase in the methylation fraction was observed for the gene Gadd45G, which encodes cytokine responsive protein. This study highlights the link between epige netic changes in inflammatory genes and pathogenesis of sepsis. Further studies are needed for validation of the role for epigenetic markers in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Sepsis genomics will help us in directing treatment against this complication.",2016
26358,"Introduction: Sphingomyelin synthase genes (SGMS1 and SGMS2) encode the vital enzymes SMS1 and SMS2 which catalyze the synthesis of sphin gomyelin and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylcholine and ceramide. SMS1 and SMS2 are involved in the processes of membrane transport, cell proli feration and apoptosis. However, the structural and functional features of sphingomyelin synthase genes are poorly understood. Materials and Methods: We present a study of mRNA expression of sphingo myelin synthase genes in adult and embryonic tissues using real time PCR. The transcript amounts were estimated relative to the average mRNA level of housekeeping genes (LDHÃÂ, GAPDH and RPL3). Results: Human, rat and mouse adult tissues as well as rat brains at embryo nic days 7, 9, 13, 17 and 21 were investigated. In adults we found similar mRNA expression of sphingomyelin synthase genes in non brain tissues, but the level of the SGMS2 mRNA was significantly lower in the brain tissues. In embryonic rat brains the mRNA expression of sphingomyelin synthase genes is varied in developmental stage specific manner. We have previous ly determined the circular RNAs (circRNAs) emerging from exons of the 5Ã¢ÂÂ untranslated region of SGMS1 gene. These circRNAs are evolutionarily con served and highly represented in human, rat and mouse adult brain. The expression of circRNAs for SGMS1 was raised during rat embryonic brain development. Conclusions: Sphingomyelin synthase genes have tissue specific and deve lopmental stage specific expression. We assume that the circRNAs are invol ved in the regulation of sphingomyelin synthase activity in different tissues and developmental stages.",2016

Introduction: Global hypermethylation of DNA has been found in several malignancies [1]. Studies on thyroid tumors have shown controversial re sults. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of DNA methylation of Cp G74a in Rap1gap gene among thyroid cancer subtypes. Methods: we analyzed 95 thyroid tumor samples including normal thyro id (33 cases), benign nodule (36cases), papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) (20 cases), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) (3 cases) and Anaplastic thyroid can cer (ATC) (3 cases) from Erfan grand hospital, Tehran, Iran. Rap1gap gene expression was assessed using SYBR Green Real Time PCR. CpG74a Island within the promoter region of this gene was selected; DNA methylation pat tern was examined using methylation specific PCR (MSP). Results: this study showed that Rap1gap was frequently lost or downregu lated in various types of tumors, particularly in the most invasive and ag gressive forms of thyroid cancer. DNA methylation status of this CpG showed that this alteration is mostly associated with Rap1gap gene downregulation in the differentiated thyroid cancers (PTC, FTC)(80%). However, this value was 16% in undifferentioated thyroid cancer (ATC). CpG74a was methylated in 66% and 72% of individuals with normal thyroid and benign nodule re spectively. Conclusion: this study demonstrates that Rap1gap is likely to serve as an important tumor suppresser gene in thyroid cells and its downregulation during aberrant methylation contributes to differentiated tumor progres sion and invasion.

26360,"ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability, Facial anomalies) syndro me type I patients carry biallelic mutations in DNMT3B which encodes the enzyme that de novo methylates repetitive sequences during embryonic de velopment. ICF type I cells display severely hypomethylated subtelomeric regions, abnormally high TERRA levels and short telomeres and ICF type I fibroblasts enter senescence prematurely. ICF syndrome is genetically hete rogeneous and three additional genes responsible for this syndrome have recently been identified; ZBTB24 (type II), CDCa7 (type III) and HELLS (type IV). These gene products were not previously linked with the processes of DNA methylation. While many phenotypic aspects of ICF types II IV are similar to type I, the telomeric phenotype of these patientsÃ¢ÂÂ cells has not yet been explored. To this end we are studying subtelomeric methylation, TERRA expression and telomere length in lymphoblastoid cells, fibroblasts and blood. Our initial findings in lymphoblastoid cells suggest that ICF ty pes II IV display subtelomeric methylation patterns that vary from those of ICF type I. NBL 1 subtelomeric repeats are hypomethylated as in type I, while the Hutel subtelomeric repeats, which contain many of the TERRA promoters, are not. In concordance with the normal methylation of Hutel repeats, these cells display normal low TERRA levels. Further characteriza tion of the telomeric phenotype in all cell types will reveal the extent of the telomeric abnormalities in these ICF patients. The findings stemming from this research will further elucidate the mechanisms by which subtelomeric methylation is generated and maintained, and how disrupted subtelomeric methylation can lead to an abnormal telomeric phenotype.

26361," Introduction. The role of the wingless integration signaling site family, member 5A (WNT5A) protein is central to mechanisms of lung healing and fibrosis, including those triggered during lung damage in the acute respi ratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We investigated whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the WNT5A gene contribute to the development of ARDS in patients with severe sepsis. Methods. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, genetic association stu dy in a cohort of 387 critically ill patients fulfilling international criteria for severe sepsis. All patients were followed for the development of ARDS. Pati ents developing moderate and severe ARDS were analyzed as a single group (n,215) and the remaining patients served as controls (n,172). Seven tag ging SNPs of the WNT5A gene were genotyped. After imputation, associati on testing with ARDS susceptibility was examined for 37 SNPs using logistic regression analysis. Results. We identified three SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (0.75Ã¢ÂÂ¤r2Ã¢ÂÂ¤1) that were associated with ARDS susceptibility as a single association signal. The most significant SNP (rs77344209) had an odds ratio of 0.56 for the T allele (95% confidence interval, 0.39 0.80; p,0.001). Based on its location, functionality assessments revealed that this SNP may participate in the mo dulation of WNT5A gene expression. Conclusions. Common variants of the WNT5A gene are significantly asso ciated with the development of sepsis induced ARDS. Further studies in independent population of patients with ARDS are ongoing to confirm our findings.

26363,"Introduction: Age related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is one of the major causes of blindness worldwide which part of the pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Polymorphisms in miRNAs and miRNA binding sites may affect miRNA function and could therefore contribute to disease risk. Methods: We investigated the extent to which variants located in miRNAs and their binding sites are associated with AMD using the largest available genome wide association study (GWAS). We integrated our findings with different biological and computational data to provide evidence for the func tionality of the identified variants. We further experimentally examined the effect of associated variants on the expression levels of related miRNAs and target genes. Results: Out of 2347 miRNA variants, 431 were present in the AMD GWAS, we found three variants that were significantly associated with AMD. In silico analysis indicated that the mutant alleles could impact on the miRNA hairpin structures. Our subsequent analysis highlighted target genes that may mediate the effect of these miRNAs on AMD. We are currently perfor ming functional experiments to validate the effect of variants on the levels of mature miRNAs and the highlighted target genes. In addition, we examined the association of 82,051 miRNA binding site variants with AMD and iden tified 76 associated variants that could potentially affect miRNA mediated regulation of their host genes. We, based on GWAS results, eQTL analysis and gene expression data, selected two of these variants to experimentally show an allele specific regulation of the host genes by related miRNAs.

26364,"Introduction: Previous allele frequency of Chinese Population was calcula ted using whole exome/genome sequencing data from 1000 Genomes Pro ject. Since 2012 to 2013, we have accumulated low coverage whole genome sequencing data of more than 140,000 clinical samples. The purpose of this study was to develop a method to calculate allele frequency in Chinese po pulation using this big and low coverage data. Method and Material: Plasma cell free DNA of each sample was sequenced to obtain ~0.1X whole genome sequencing depth. Maximum likelihood and site frequency spectrum were used to estimate allele frequency, and the re sults were compared to the 1000 Genome Project results. Genetic hearing loss was used as a disease model to evaluate the accuracy of allele frequency estimation. As the application of this method, allele frequency of height and diabetes was used for association studies. Result: The allele frequency spectrum of 140,000 samples was consistent to the 1,000 Genomes Project results, while more variants of ultra low fre quency could be detected. Validated by mass spectrometry results, allele frequency ranging from 0.1% to 1% of 11 loci of genetic hearing loss could be accurately detected. Association study of height related loci revealed five potential targets (ACAN, GABRA1 GABRG2, PMCH IGF1, FERMT1 BMP2 and FADS1. One suggestive susceptibility locus of diabetes, LAMC2 at rs942617, was also identified. Conclusion: It is possible to use the big data of low coverage sequencing results to calculate allele frequency.

26365," Introduction: Ancestry assignment in medical and forensic applications re sults inadequate if based on self perceptions. Using genetic information for the inference usually requires a large number of SNPs, being impractical and cost prohibitive in some settings. In addition, the most cost effective SNP sets consistent on less than a dozen SNPs, only permit the assignation to four out of the seven continental groups. Here we aimed to provide a re duced informative SNP set, preserving a sufficient assignment capacity to seven continental groups, providing a technology unconstrained low cost solution. Materials and Methods: We explored the use of a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, which allowed evaluating millions of combinatorial models based on a tree search automatically bypassing the ancestry infor mation redundancy provided by the SNPs. We utilized 60% of the human DNA samples from the CEPH HGDP , determined for 650K SNPs, to derive the SNP sets consistent in 5 to 12 SNP combinations. The reminder 40% of the CEPH HGDP samples was used for testing their assignment capacity based on differences in likelihood assignations to each group. An additional validation was performed in data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) populations. Results: The SNP sets with <12 SNPs were able to assign up to 52.3% of the testing sample. We derived six equivalently optimal 12 SNP sets demonstra ting, on average, a correct assignment of 87% of CEPH HGDP and 88% of the 1KGP samples. Conclusions: The 12 SNP sets constitute novel solutions for blind, cost ef fective and precise assignment of a subjectÃ¢ÂÂs ancestry to one of the seven continental groups.",2016
26366,"Introduction: Despite the low concentrations of ancient DNA (aDNA) in hi storical samples and the risk of its contamination with modern DNA, aDNA provides valuable information from various historical periods. The aim of this study was to isolate and analyse aDNA from human remains from me dieval cementery on DevÃÂ­n Castle (Slovakia) dated to 11th and 12th century for the purpose of mitochondrial haplogroups determination. Due to the proximity of the DevÃÂ­n Castle to the medieval overland a river trade routes, we expected the occurrence of haplogroups atypical for this region. Materials and Methods: As a samples for the aDNA isolation were used 40 human teeth and bones. All worksteps were carried out in accordance with strict recommendations for working with aDNA. Determination of mito chondrial haplogroups was performed on the basis of the HVRI sequencing followed by analysis of polymorphisms in this region. Results: We determined 11 different haplogroups (H, H1, H1a, H5, J2b, K, T1a, T2, U5a, V and W) with 16 various haplotypes. Conclusions: Although we detected haplogroups with higher frequencies in regions of present day Hungary (W) and northeastern Germany (H1a), all of the observed haplogroups are commonly distributed in central Europe (where the DevÃÂ­n Castle is also located) and one of the possible explanations of the absence of more ,,exoticÃ¢ÂÂ haplogroups may be lower importance of DevÃÂ­n Castle as a part of the medieval trade routes.",2016

The role of thy mus in the pathology is highlighted by the presence of frequent histological abnormalities, as thymoma and hyperplasia, and by the benefit of thymec tomy. To reveal risk factors linked to thymic pathology in MG, we applied a mathematical approach based on an artificial adaptive system called Auto Contractive Map Auto CM algorithm (Auto CM), a special kind of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) able to find associations among variables. Materials and methods: A total of 491 AChR + MG patients were characteri zed for age, gender, onset of pathology, Osserman classification of MG and thymic pathology.

26369," Introduction: Opioid therapy is a mainstay in acute and chronic pain ma nagement especially for cancer related pain. Genetic causes for inter indi vidual variability of the clinical response to opioids have been proved for several years. Mu opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary target of morphine for cancer pain treatment. KAPPA opioid receptor (KOR) has a functional interaction with MOR activation pathway and COMT (Cathechol O methyl transferase) is a key enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines in the nervous system and has been linked to substance abuse. In this study, we focused on six polymorphisms in Mu and Kappa opioid receptors and COMT genes (OPRM1; OPRK1 and COMT respectivily), and their association to morphine dose needed to decrease the pain intensity in tunisian cancerous patients. Materials and Methods: We collected 129 blood samples from cancerous patients under morphine treatment at different doses. DNA extraction was achieved for all patients.

Many previous studies have demonstrated the contribution of genetic variants in the susceptibility and outcomes of this syndrome. In this study, we aimed to identify novel genes implicated in sepsis derived ARDS susceptibility and/or survival. Materials and Methods: We performed a prioritization of candidate genes by means of the integration of genomic data from a transcriptomic study in an animal model and from a genome wide association study of trauma induced ARDS in humans. From them, three single nucleotide polymorphis ms (SNPs) from three different genes were selected to conduct a genetic association study. DNA samples from unrelated individuals with ARDS deri ved from sepsis (n,349) and from population based controls (n,900) were genotyped using competitive allele specific PCR assays. Results: A SNP from FL T1 gene (rs9513106) was associated with ARDS susceptibility, with an odds ratio (OR), 0.81 for the C allele, 95% confi dence interval (CI): 0.65 1.00, p,0.037.

Early environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure (in utero or during infancy) is a known risk factor for childhood onset and late onset asthma. Objective: Our goal was to identify genetic variants interacting with early ETS exposure that influence time to asthma onset (TAO).Methods: We conducted a large scale meta analysis of five genome wide in teraction studies (GEWIS) of TAO (totaling 3,643 exposed (ETS+) and 5,275 non exposed (ETS ) individuals of European ancestry) using survival ana lysis methodologies. Two tests were performed: 1) a joint test of SNP effect and GxETS interaction and 2) a test of GxETS interaction alone. Results: While the joint test confirmed two asthma regions (9p24 & 17q12 q21) interacting with ETS on TAO at the genome wide significant level (P<5x10 8), the interaction test revealed three new loci: 13q21, 16p13 and 19q13 (6.7x10 7<P<10 6). Further analysis of the 9p24 and 17q12 q21 loci stratified on asthma age of onset (before and after six years) confirmed the known ETSx17q12 q21 interaction in childhood onset asthma and eviden ced a complex effect of 9p24 top SNP on asthma risk with: 1) the strongest effect in ETS+ early onset subjects (HR [CI],1.41 [1.25 1.58]), 2) an inter mediate effect in both ETS early onset (HR,1.23 [1.12 1.34]) and ETS+ late onset subjects (HR,1.26 [1.14 1.39]) and 3) no effect in ETS late onset subjects (P,0.38).Conclusion: This study suggests an important role of early ETS exposure and 9p24 genetic variants in asthma age of onset.

Atherosclerosis is cardinal to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and hi stological studies have identified plaque characteristics that associate with clinical outcome. To what extent common variation associated with CVD relates to these characteristics remains unknown. We studied the impact of sequence variation on plaque characteristics, and tissue specific gene expression by combining data from independent biobanks comprising pa tients with clinically significant arterial stenosis. Methods: We genotyped 1,439 patients from Athero Express, 127 patients from BiKE, and 109 patients from STAGE. We tested 61 CVD susceptibili ty loci for association to seven plaque characteristics, and gene expression using regression modeling, correcting for age, sex, 10 principal components, and study specific covariates.

NGS results were then validated by Sanger sequencing. The genetic diagno sis was achieved in 15 patients (83.33%) including 15 novel and 1 previous ly reported variants in 6 genes (one case was compound heterozygote). The novel variants were absent in population and disease specific databases, were predicted to be disease causing by multiple in silico predictive tools, and changed nucleotides were evolutionally well conserved. All variants were shown to be segregating in the family. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants, they are classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic va riants.

26375,"Aim: Taste perception plays an important role in the diet composition, which is the leading lifestyle risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and can cer. The aim of this study was to investigate genetic background of bitter taste perception. Materials and methods: Subjects from the 10,001 Dalmatians cohort were involved in the bitter taste recognition threshold measurement, based on water solution of quinine, starting from 1E 06 M and increasing by 0.22 log value. A GWAS meta analysis was performed using 317.500 SNPs in a samp le of 936 individuals from the Island of Korcula and Vis, and the City of Split, Croatia, controlling for age, gender and kinship. Results: Bitter taste threshold was strongly associated with 8 SNPs from PRH1 PRR4, PRH1, TAS2R19 and TAS2R20 gene, with P values between 1.5E 11 to 8.8E 39, belonging to the following SNPs: rs4763602, rs10772420, rs12226919, rs12226920, rs10845279, rs7307031, rs10845289 and rs10492102. Additionally, we detected marginally suggestive SNP at chro mosome 6, belonging to ADGRF5 gene (rs1004018; P, 4.4E 07). Conclusion: While the finding of the PRH1 PRR4, PRH1, TAS2R19 and TAS2R20 genes confirms the previous studies, the ADGRF5 gene is reported for the first time, suggesting even greater complexity of the genetic basis of bitter taste perception. These results could be used in numerous appli cations, including personalized dietary planning, fitness and other health related utilization. Further refinement of these results in the imputed data and increased sample sizes is under way. Funding: Medical Research Council UK, Croatian Science Foundation grant 8875.

26376,"Functional variants are likely to be aggregated in family studies enriched with affected members, and this aggregation increases the statistical power for rare variant detection. In addition to the identification of associations with qualitative and quantitative traits under a generalized linear model fra mework, associations of rare variants with time to event traits are of gro wing interest. However, very limited approaches are available for the analy sis of rare variant associations with time to event traits in family or hybrid designs. Therefore, we developed novel pedigree based burden and kernel association tests for family time to event outcomes with right censoring, and used Cox proportion hazard models to relate a time to event trait with rare variants. We describe how to employ Cox models in commonly used pedigree based burden and kernel tests. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our proposed tests when the proportional hazard assumption is violated. Statistical inferences can be made through asymptotic distributi ons of the proposed tests, permitting their application to large scale whole genome sequencing data. The proposed tests are appropriate for practical use under a wide range of misspecified Cox models, as well as for hybrid population and pedigree based designs. Extensive simulation studies were conducted to compare the proposed tests with existing gene based rare variant association tests for family survival outcomes. We applied the pro posed tests to the exome chip data from the Diabetes Heart Study to identify variants associated with age at onset of type 2 diabetes.",2016
26377,"Archaeological findings suggest that modern humans have inhabited the Caucasus since Paleolithic times but little is known about their origin and how they have interacted with neighboring populations. Previous genetic studies of present day populations from the Steppe suggested the Caucasus acted as a barrier, leading to genetic discontinuity between the Caucasus and the East European Plain. Furthermore, geography, ethnicity, and lan guage are also expected to influence the mating patterns of the populations inhabiting the Caucasus and thus create genetic structure within this region. Here we use whole genome genotyping and sequencing data to fully under stand the genetic diversity of the Caucasus and its role in the demographic process that shaped modern Eurasian genomes. Combining data from 12 high coverage whole genome sequences, four each from Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan with SNP genotype data from more than 250 individuals from the same populations, we present one of the most comprehensive datasets for this region. Principal component analyses, fol lowed by model based clustering, reveal previously unreported structure among the Caucasus populations. In particular, we discovered three diffe rent clusters among Georgians and two in Azerbaijan, in addition to diffe rent ancestral proportions in these clusters. MSMC analysis of the whole ge nomes shows Caucasus populations have diverged in the last 20,000 years from other Eurasians and have experienced different demographic changes in recent times We thus provide a detailed analysis of the past and present demography of the Caucasus which will be useful for understanding the genetic diversity of this region and the relationship with European populations.",2016

Introduction: Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common multifactorial and complex disease characterized by an abnormal reflux of blood in veins. De spite the high prevalence of CVD, the hereditary component is still unknown. The purpose of this study is to quantify the genetic basis of the CVD and its relationship to venous thromboembolism, (VTE).Methods: The sample consisted of 895 individuals (60 patients with CVD) belonging to 35 extended pedigrees in the GAIT2 Project. Patients were dia gnosed by venous Doppler ultrasound technique following the guidelines of the American Venous Forum. We correlated this disease with other trombo embolic diseases and 86 hemostatic phenotypes using variance component in SOLAR.

ORG 374Back to index pression with CVD was performed using bivariate mixed models in Solarius. Results: Heritability of the CVD was 76%. More interestingly, we found a highly significant genetic correlation with VTE, 0.76. Only suggestive signals were found from the GWAS and RNAseq studies. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the most extensive study (clinical and biological phenotypes, GWAS and RNAseq data) performed to date to unravel the genetic components of CVD and other related venous diseases. Despite this huge amount of data we did not find any clear signal to explain the high heritability observed and the genetic correlation between CVD and VTE. These results emphasized the high complexity of the genetic basis un derlying this disease. Grants: RD12/0042/0032, PI11/0184, PI12/00612 and PI15/00269",2016
26379,"Genomic copy number variants (CNVs) are thought to account for an im portant part of human variability. The number, location and type of CNVs that are annotated in the different studies depend largely on the techniques and algorithms used for their detection. We have compared five of the most comprehensive high resolution CNV maps published in 2015 (Handsaker et al.; Zarrei et al.; Sudmant et al., Science; Sudmant et al., Nature; Abyzov et al.) and evaluated the potential impact of the CNVs on protein coding genes by classifying them in different gene ages. In all maps, we see that CNVs that en compass whole genes (thus influencing their gene dosage) are significantly enriched in Primate specific genes and significantly depleted in more anci ent genes, confirming and extending our previous results (Juan et al, Biology Open, 2013).The higher resolution of the integrated experiments allows us to uncover that when CNVs are overlapping with exons, they accumulate in recent ge nes, a similar pattern to that of whole gene CNVs. However, partial CNVs lo cated within introns are over represented in ancient genes. More precisely, genes born before the ancestor of human and bony fish show an excess of intronic deletions in current human populations. We will present our on going analyses characterising the genomic, epigenomic and functional cha racteristics of the ancient genes showing these intronic deletions. Taken together, our results show how the precise mapping of CNVs in com bination with phylogenetic information allows us to understand the diffe rential impact of duplications and deletions in protein coding regions.",2016
26380,"Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors contributing to susceptibility. The analysis of gene environment interactions (GxE) can identify new susceptibility loci but statistical power is reduced in part because agnostic searches require adjustment for millions of tests. To reduce this burden and improve power in a GxE analysis, one option is to incorporate functional genomics data to prioritize the candidate SNPs. Materials and methods: We are generating RNA seq data from 300 normal colon biopsies from voluntary subjects undergoing colonoscopy within a screening program. Detailed environmental and lifestyle risk factor infor mation is requested by personal interview. Here we focus on the analysis of the association between gene expression and environmental variables (eQTL analyses will follow). Linear models have been used, adjusted for age, sex and education. Empirical Bayes adjustments and false discovery rates are calculated to reduce false positive results. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis has been also performed to identify pathways modified by each environ mental exposure. Results: To date, 145 samples have been fully analyzed and preliminary re sults indicate that significant associations can be identified for genes with expression correlated to red meat, processed meat, vegetables, fruits, alco hol, smoking, physical exercise, aspirin and BMI. Conclusions: Environmental variables known to be risk factors for CRC mo dify the expression of specific genes in the normal colon mucosa.

Chung; Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan. Introduction: Gene gene interaction can play an important role in complex disease etiology. With the advancement of next generation sequencing, many rare variants have been discovered. However, current gene gene inter action tests are mainly developed for common variants. Therefore, a gene gene interaction test accounting for rare variants is desirable. Materials and Methods: We developed a powerful gene gene interaction test, which includes several steps: (1) for a pair of genes, odds ratios of in teraction for all pairs of rare SNPs between the two genes are calculated; (2) the SNP pairs are ranked by the odds ratios, and the pairs with rank in the highest and lowest 2.5% are selected; (3) calculate the overall genotype counts for the selected pairs. The interaction statistic based on odds ratios (IOR) or goodness of fit (IGOF) is calculated using the genotype counts. (4) Permutations are used to calculate the p value. Results: We used simulations to evaluate the type I error rates and compare the power of the proposed tests with another interaction test for rare vari ants (SPAr). Our simulation results suggest that the IOR and IGOF have ap propriate type I error rates. Moreover, IGOF is generally more powerful than IOR, while both tests have higher power than SPAr. Conclusions: In conclusion, the IOR and IGOF will be very useful to detect gene gene interactions for rare variants. We implemented the IOR and IGOF into an efficient software with C++ incorporating threads and MPI.

26381,"Introduction: The diagnostic algorithm for intellectual disability which was described in the Consensus for the Implementation of Arrays 2012, has ge nerated the massive identification of new copy number variations (CNVs). Their functional assessment requires a comparison with the described CNVs and with our population scope. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the CNVs identified in 28 boys and 22 girls, who were studied for having developed non recognized syndromic phenotypes, with Valencian ancestor. The genomic array using SNPs/CNVs, CytoScanÃÂ® HD Affymetrix, was applied. The obtained raw data, were analy zed with Chromosome Analysis Suite (Chas) software. The exact location of each CNV, was compared with overlapping variants, which were described in the CNVs data bases. Results: 16 not described CNVs appeared. Their location overlapped with similar CNVs referred in ISCA as pathogenic. 7 patients, which result array was negative, carried one of these 7 CNVs (92 to 2 kbp); local origins were corroborated. The other 9 CNVs (16 to 4 kbp) are recurrently found in the series. Two patients carried the LOH fragments of 33.9 and 30.8 Mb, respec tively. Conclusions: The percentage of solved cases was similar to that proposed in the Consensus (20%). 7 of the 11 resolved cases (63.6%) carried cryptic causal alterations (<4 Mb). Building databases of CNVs with undetermined significance, from individuals of population level, was essential to the de termination of its deleterious and informativeness capacity. Its existence repeatedly did not rule out its possible relationship with the clinical phe notype; wide association studies are essential for their proper assessment.",2016

We refine the ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 375Back to index current knowledge of the genetic structure in Finland and study whether it explains regional differences in incidence of CAD. Material and Methods: We apply recent haplotype based methods Chro moPainter and fineSTRUCTURE to 2376 such individuals from the FINRISK Study survey of 1997 for whom both parents were born close to each other. We generate two CAD genetic risk scores: (1) Ã¢ÂÂLead SNPÃ¢ÂÂ score using 153 independent lead SNPs and (2) Ã¢ÂÂPolygenicÃ¢ÂÂ score using 49,000 LD pruned SNPs with P value below 0.05 from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium. Results: We show that the genetic borderline between NE and SW Finland follows closely the historic border from 1323 with relatively little uncer tainty. Among the genetically identified subpopulations, incidence of CAD in the NE region of Kainuu is 1.82 times as high as in SW Finland and our Ã¢ÂÂLead SNPÃ¢ÂÂ score for CAD yields an odds ratio of 1.11 (p,0.025) between Kainuu and SW Finland. The distribution of our Ã¢ÂÂPolygenicÃ¢ÂÂ score shows re latively high risk for CAD in East and low risk in SW, which further reflects the known incidence of the disease. Conclusions: Haplotype based methods reveal new details describing Fin nish population structure.

26383,"Introduction: Recent genome wide association studies have identified 56 loci associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) among predominantly European populations. However, their relevance to Asian populations is lar gely unknown. Methods: We utilized GWAS data (1,147 CAD cases and 3,451 controls) from two Singaporean Chinese studies. Logistic regression analyses were carried out in each dataset and subsequently meta analyzed. We further tested for involvement of known canonical pathways for loci that had significant asso ciations in our study using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Results: We detected associations at five index variants at the CDKN2A/2B , PHACTR1, BCAS3, ABO and VAMP5/VAMP8/GGCX loci (P values 6.37x10 4 4.53x10 2). At four additional loci (in or near LPL, REST/NOA1, COL4A1/2 and ZEB2 genes), we also detected modest associations (meta analysis no minal P values ranging from 8.65 x 10 3 4.46 x 10 2) for regional SNPs that were in at least moderate LD with previously reported index SNPs (r2 >0.4 in 1000G ASN populations). Six pathways, including cell cycle regulation pa thways, glioma signaling and adipogenesis pathways (P value 0.034 0.043) were identified.

26384,"Introduction: Although numerous phenotype based equations for predic ting risk of Ã¢ÂÂhardÃ¢ÂÂ coronary heart disease (CHD) are available, limited data exist regarding the utility of genetic information for such risk prediction in the Singaporean Chinese. Methods: We conducted a case control study nested within the Singapo re Chinese Health Study (SCHS). A total of 836 males (267 cases) and 470 females (128 cases) were included. All the SNPs included were previously reported in genome wide association studies (GWAS) and were associated with CHD or its risk factors. Cox proportional hazards models with adju stments for age and gender were used to evaluate each SNP . Those asso ciated with p values less than 0.10 were used to build the Genetic Risk Score (GRS). Three different base models were used M1: Recalibrated Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) Model; M2: Model built on traditional risk fac tors used in ATPIII with their coefficients estimated using SCHS data and M3:M2+hsCRP+creatinine. Results: The GRS was significantly associated with CHD. The inclusion of GRS in the prediction models were shown to improve discrimination, with c statistics reaching between 0.750 0.758 as compared to 0.662 0.697 ob tained from base models for males and between 0.827 0.835 as compared to 0.773 0.780 for females.

Results: We could obtain karyotype from 2376 cases (98.3%). 294 (12.4%) had an abnormal karyotype. Among these, the majority was 179 females (60.8%), and there was 1 male XX (0.3%). The median age was 9 years. 63 patients (21.4%) were newborns, 51 (17.3%) were between 1 month to 1 year old and 59 (20%) were 18 years old or older. The commonest abnor malities were DS (57 cases (19.4%), with 3.5% mosaic and 7% robertso nian translocations) and TS (51 cases (17.3%), with 58.8% mosaic cases). We also found 19 (6.4%) KS cases (26.3% mosaic); 67 (22.7%) unbalanced rearrangements; 29 (9.9%) apparently balanced translocations, being 10 (34.4 %) relatives of index cases and 6 (2%) complex rearrangements. Conclusions: We observed a lower rate of abnormalities than previous stu dies. Karyotyping is still an important tool for screening for malformations and developmental delay in developing countries and is also important for evaluating sexual aberrations and familial translocations.

26386,"Introduction: Facial shape shows great variation in humans and is of con siderable importance in biomedicine and forensics. Facial appearance has a strong genetic component and could have evolved to facilitate individual recognition. Although genes have been identified for various abnormal phe notypes and genome wide studies in European populations have been con ducted, the genetic basis of normal variation in human facial traits is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: We conducted a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using ~700,000 genome wide markers from ~6,000 Latin Ameri can individuals. We considered fourteen ordinal facial traits examined in individual photographs. Nine of these traits were also examined in a sub set of samples (~ 3,000) using landmarks to obtain quantitative data. Associa tion tests used univariate linear regression with an additive genetic model considering age, sex, BMI and five genetic PCs as covariates. Results and Discussion: SNPs situated in four gene regions (DCHS2, RUNX2, GLI3 and PAX1) showed associations with three ordinal traits related to nose morphology (wing breadth, root breadth, columella inclination). Quan titative analyses confirmed these associations and, in addition, detected an association of SNPs in EDAR with chin protrusion. Consistently, we characte rized Edar mouse mutants and found alterations of mandible length. Finally, we replicated the reported association of nasion position with SNPs in PAX3. The genes identified have been implicated in craniofacial development, car tilage bone differentiation, malformations and the evolution of the face.

Cohorts included in DIAGRAM were excluded from PGC MDD 29. Secondary analyses examined the interaction of T2DM polygenic risk scores with i) sex and ii) Body Mass Index (BMI). Results: T2DM polygenic scores did not predict depression case status at any PT threshold, and no interaction between T2DM polygenic scores and BMI was detected.

Understanding such structure can inform on optimal design of clinical genetic studies as well as the history of the Irish population. We present an overview of, and the preliminary findings from, the study. Methods: We are recruiting individuals with all eight great grandparents born in Ireland, within 30 kilometres of each other. Participants are asked to complete a detailed birth brief, which records place and date of birth of three generations of ancestors. DNA is extracted from a saliva sample. We have genotyped using an Illumina OmniExpress dense SNP genotyping plat form.

26391,"Introduction: Variance or variation SNPs (vSNPs) are genetic variants asso ciated with phenotypic variance heterogeneity, rather than mean phenoty pic value. Such vSNPs could be advantageous for adaptation to new environ ments. It has been suggested that vSNPs can increase epigenetic plasticity, and thereby even explain part of the missing heritability behind complex diseases. In this study, we have identified vSNPs associated with unequal variances in DNA methylation. Materials and Methods: DNA methylation levels at over 450,000 CpG sites and genotype data from over 10,000,000 SNPs were analyzed in 729 indivi duals. The variances for different genotypes were compared using an F test. Results: We could verify that three previously identified vSNPs (rs6936204, rs6936204, and rs3130320) are associated with unequal variance in DNA methylation (P 0.99) with respective vSNP . We also identify 4797 novel vSNPs (p< 9.4e 11) of which a majority (96.7%) are due to additional lin ked SNPs that alter the mean methylation level of the CpG site. Only a small number of the vSNPs identified (N,132) did not appear to be explained by additionally linked SNPs. Conclusions: Most vSNPs are not causing epigenetic plasticity, but are rather caused by linked genetic variants that are associated with the phenotypic mean. However, we have identified other potential vSNPs that might influ ence the variance in DNA methylation, possibly increasing the epigenetic plasticity and thus altering individualsÃ¢ÂÂ risk of environmentally induced diseases.",2016
26392,"It has been proposed that epigenetic modifications play a key role in me diating individualsÃ¢ÂÂ phenotypic responses to environmental changes. Recent epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) have confirmed that environ mental exposures, such as smoking, affect DNA methylation levels in human populations. Until now, EWAS have predominantly focused on finding mean differences in methylation levels between exposed and unexposed subjects. We hypothesise that environmental factors can increase epigenetic variabi lity at functionally relevant genomic regions in individuals exposed to en vironmental stimuli, and that the increased epigenetic variance can trigger phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental exposures. Monozygotic (MZ) twin studies are extremely valuable to detect environ mentally driven epigenetic changes, as MZ twins are matched for many fac tors, ruling out the possibility that associated epigenetic modifications are attributed to genetic variation. Here, we used an environment concordance MZ twin study design to detect CpG sites showing differences in DNA me thylation variance between twins exposed and unexposed to smoking, that we define as Ã¢ÂÂenvironmentally induced variable methylated sitesÃ¢ÂÂ (eVMSs). To search for eVMS in a dataset of 490 female Caucasian from the TwinsUK registry, we calculated the difference of DNA methylation within each twin pair as a dispersion measure, and we applied the F test to detect differences in dispersion values among smoking groups. We validated the genome wide significant eVMSs using the Brown ForsytheÃ¢ÂÂs test in a subset of 438 unre lated subjects. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between eVMSs and metabolic and healthy ageing traits to understand how risk factors, and the consequent environmental induced epigenetic variability, may trigger disease related phenotypic changes.",2016

Patterns of hair appearance are highly heritable, showing distinct differences across continents. Association studies, mostly in European and East Asian samples, have found loci corre sponding to scalp hair color, shape and male pattern baldness. In a genome wide association study of admixed Latin Americans from five different countries, we identified eighteen genome wide significant associa tions for features of scalp hair (shape, color, graying, balding) and facial hair (beard thickness, mono brow, eyebrow thickness), including ten novel asso ciations. These contain the first reported loci for hair graying, mono brow, and eyebrow and beard thickness. A newly identified locus influencing hair shape includes a Q30R substitution in the Protease Serine S1 family member 53 (PRSS53). This enzyme appears to be highly expressed in the hair folli cle, especially the inner root sheath, and that the Q30R substitution affects enzyme processing and secretion. The identified regions can have implicati ons for both forensics and the cosmetics industry. Consistent with proposals regarding the evolution of human hair, the genomic regions associated with hair features are enriched for signals of selection.",2016
26394,"Introduction: Young adult patients with FA face a high risk of solid malignan cies. Efforts have been developed to promote follow up programs for early cancer detection (Spanish guidelines from the Red Nacional de Anemia de Fanconi, 2012 ). Here we aim to describe our 6 year experience and the stra tegies developed to enhance compliance and reduce patientÃÂ´s cancer risk. Materials and Methods: From 26 FA patients, 58% are male, median age 21 (17 34y), 11 are current or former smokers. Patients undergo a full ana mnesis and receive health education in the high risk clinics and are recom mended a surveillance program that includes hematological, head and neck, oral cavity, and gynecologic (females) follow up every 6 months. Results: All women have had HPV vaccination, and one premalignant cervi cal lesion was detected (CIN1). In two patients (8%) bone marrow aspira te yielded a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome. Seven patients (27%) were diagnosed with a malignant tumor. In a biallelic BRCA2 patient with a prior breast cancer, a secondary in situ breast cancer was detected in her prophylactic contralateral mastectomy. The other six patients had a tumor in the head and neck area (HNSCC). At maxilofacial follow up, two in situ SCC in the oral cavity were diagnosed. Conclusion: HNSCC are the most frequent neoplasm in young adults with FA. Intensive surveillance and preventive strategies are needed. Avoiding tobacco and counseling about healthy lifestyle habits are mandatory to minimize their risk of solid tumors. Increasing self awareness of oral changes to seek medical evaluation are warranted for early detection.",2016
26395,"Introduction:The prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing; thus large prospective cohorts studies are needed to increment the genetic and epide miological knowledge of these conditions. Materials&Methods:The Genomes for Life project develops a multi purpose prospective cohort study that aims to identify genomic, epigenomic, envi ronmental and lifestyle factors, as well as their interactions involved in the development of cancer and other diseases (i.e.cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic). At recruitment, participants reported information on lifestyle/dietary habits, drug use, diseases diagnostics, family history of diseases, and medical interventions using questionnaires. Information on anthropometric measures, blood pressure, rate pulse, and blood sample were also collected for each participant. Started in the mid 2014 (still ongoing), the population is being recruited through the Blood and Tissue Bank network from Public Healthcare users, aged 40 65 years, and with current residence in the Cata lan region. Participants will regularly update their exposure data and will be followed over time for the occurrence of events and mortality by linkage to personal clinical records from the Catalan Public Healthcare. Results:In February 2016, the GCAT included 9.500 volunteers. The pres ent analysis is based on a subset of 8.910 observations, of which 59% were women. 72% of the participants reported having a good self perceived health, and according to the WHO classification, 54% were overweight. The most common self reported diseases were hypercholesterolemia, allergies, and hypertension (18%,17%,and 15% respectively), and 4% of participants had diabetes. Currently 3.500 blood samples have been genotyped for fur ther analyses. Conclusions:The GCAT project represents a platform for implementation of the genomic medicine on chronic disorders.",2016
26396,"The Israeli population is combined of various ethnic groups which are quite conserved. These groups are Jewish (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) and arabs ( Muslem, Christian, Druze). High frequency of genetic diseases is unique to the Israeli population as a result of its religious isolated small communities, and high rate of consanguinity. Founder mutations are known to be present in these communities and were identified over the years (e.g. Tay Sachs). With the possibility to perform a molecular diagnosis of many genetic di seases, many disorders became candidates for screening. The Israeli Society of Medical Geneticists (ISMG) made recommendations to expand the carrier screening program and include all of the severe genetic diseases in which the carrier frequency has 1:60. The Israeli MOH accepted this recommenda tions and today 18 tests are offered free of charge to the general population. This program offers carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, fragile X, and spinal muscular atrophy for the general population and additional tests for severe diseases with high carrier frequency to specific ethnic groups according to founder mutation. Methods: Tests are offered by the primary physician as part of preconcep tion recommendations. Pretest information are given by trained professio nals. Carriers are referred to genetic counseling for discussion of prenatal tests options. Results: More than 400,000 tests were done during 2013 2014 for the above 18 traits. Of these 117,291 were CF carrier screening tests. The CF registry proves the impact of this program showing a marked reduction in CF birth rates with a shift towards milder mutations.",2016
26397,"Since the dawn of GWAS the number of genotyping arrays has exploded, which makes the choice of array challenging. We compared all currently available arrays on several array characteristics (coverage and imputation efficiency) and focused on several SNP categories such as pharmacogene tics, actionable genes and mtDNA. SNP manifest files for all arrays were obtained from Illumina and Affyme trix. Calculations of coverage were based on the 1kG reference panel, which was divided in its separate ancestries. Imputations using HapMap samples were performed to 1kG. For pharmacogenetics 388 genes and for Ã¢ÂÂactionab le genesÃ¢ÂÂ 56 genes proposed by ACMG were considered. For mtDNA 71 mt loci were evaluated. Twenty three arrays were included in the comparison. The coverage in creased with the size (number of variants) of the array. Imputation quality also increased with the size of the array, indicating that coverage is a good predictor of imputation quality. For both pharmacogenetics and actionab le genes a similar trend was observed. However, for pharmacogenetics the DrugDev array from Illumina had over double the number of variants in the se genes compared to other arrays of similar size (P<0.0001). Similarly, for actionable genes the Axiom_UKB had 7 times more variants than expected (P<0.0001). No trend was observed for mtDNA, however 3 of the arrays had no mtDNA content, while the global array had a much larger mtDNA content than average (P,0.001).In conclusion, choosing the right genotyping array will depend on the que stions to be answered. However, comparing the different arrays using objec tive criteria can help make this decision more manageable.",2016
26398," Introduction: The identification of genetic variants involved in determining skin color has anthropological and forensic importance and could help to identify genetic factors involved in the susceptibility to skin cancer. Here we aimed to uncover genes associated with skin pigmentation in African admixed populations. Materials and Methods: We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of melanin levels in 285 Puerto Ricans genotyped with the Axiom LAT1 array (Affymetrix). Imputation of genetic variants was performed using The Haplotype Reference Consortium data by means of the Michigan Imputation Server. A total of 11 million variants with minor allele frequency Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 1% and RsqÃ¢ÂÂ¥ 0.3 were analyzed for association using EPACTS. Variants with pÃ¢ÂÂ¤1x10 5 were followed up for replication in 373 African Americans genotyped with the same array. Results: A total of 82 variants associated with melanin levels in Puerto Ri cans at pÃ¢ÂÂ¤1x10 5. Seventy seven were accurately imputed in African Ameri cans, 14 of which showed evidence of replication. A meta analysis of the two samples identified nine genome wide significant hits: seven of them located within two genes already known to be associated with skin color (SLC24A5 [min p value,2.6x10 14] and SLC45A2 [min p value,9.7x10 10]), and two va riants located in an intergenic region between BEND7 and PRPF18 (min p value,4.6x10 9), a locus associated with skin color for the first time. Conclusions: Our GWAS in African admixed populations confirmed the im portance of two loci identified by previous studies and revealed the contri bution of a new locus in skin pigmentation.",2016
26399,"Background. Etruscan civilization flourished in central Italy from the eighth century BC to the first century AD. A theory of its origin was reported by Herodotus (484 425 BC), who guessed Etruscans came from Asia Minor. In Lemnos, an Aegean island, a stele with inscriptions similar to Etruscan language was found in 1885. Several genetic studies with conflicting pieces of evidence have been accumulated. We analysed the genetic relationships of modern Tuscans with other Aegean peoples by comparing 668,506 DNA SNPs in 122 unrelated individuals living since many generations where the historical Etruscans were settled (i.e. Murlo, Viterbo, Ferrara) and Lemnos island (n,16). Results. Several identity by state (IBS) analyses pointed to a stratification of different genetic contributions to the Tuscan modern genome. Ancestry proportions computed using the ADMIXTURE code showed a predominance of Southern European and Middle Eastern components (38.0%ÃÂ±2.8% and 40.3%ÃÂ±3.8%, respectively). Principal component analysis highlighted the genetic relationship of Tuscans to Southern Europe in addition to that with Greek and Aegean individuals. Conclusion. The high resolution analysis of the modern Tuscan genome exhibits a genetic signature broadly consistent with strata from Lemnos and Greece on a genetic background contributed by Middle Eastern and neighbouring Southern Italian individuals. Such results, to be corroborated by testing more and geographically better distributed individuals, are lea ding to a radical change of our paradigm of population genetic studies by rephrasing the often abused concept of population origin.

26400,"Introduction: An individualÃ¢ÂÂs genome is composed primarily of common va riants, which are not uniformly distributed across all human populations. This uneven distribution is especially significant in Africa, characterized by a complex genetic structure, and where dramatic variation in allele frequen cies is found across populations. Materials and Methods: We analyze low coverage whole genomes from 3,400 Africans sampled from a dozen populations throughout the continent in order to quantify highly differentiated variants (HDVs). HDVs are variants common in one population but rare in another. We perform an enrichment analysis to test whether HDVs are enriched for specific biological functions, and we use population genetic theory to analytically predict the number of expected HDVs. Results: We see little differentiation among Bantu speaking populations, emphasizing the strong genetic footprint that the Bantu expansion left in sub Saharan Africa. We find that HDVs are more affected by genetic drift than by time since divergence between populations, and we detect an ex ponential relationship between the number of HDVs and Fst. We identify some biological functions that are enriched in HDVs, though predictions of the number of HDVs do not deviate from observed HDVs. Conclusions: Overall, we conclude that the number of HDVs found between populations is mainly due to demography rather than natural selection even though a large fraction of HDVs are likely to be functional.

Glycans are complex carbohydrates attached to the surface of the protein. With glycosylation being amongst the most abundant post translational modification, glycans have important role in many physiological processes. Almost forty years ago they were first shown to be changed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and ever since the number of diseases associated with glycosylation has been growing. We have performed genome wide association studies of 77 immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation traits on 8000 samples imputed to HapMap2 reference panel originating from four different European cohorts with replication in four additional European cohorts (n , 4500). Conditional and joint analyses have been performed using Genome wide Complex Trait analysis software. Data Driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits has been used to prioritise genes within associated loci. More than a hundred novel hits mapping to more than thirty loci have been discovered, many of which were previously shown to be associated with various autoimmune diseases, implicating potential pleiotropy of IgG gly cosylation and diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Gene sets and pathways enriched for association with glycosylation have been assessed, providing additional insights in the mechanisms of protein glycosylation. With this study we expanded the network of genes known to be involved in glycosylation of immunoglobulin G providing us with further insights how these molecules could be involved in complex human diseases.

26402,"Cerebrovascular disease is one of the leading causes of disability in adults. Variability in functional outcome after ischemic stroke can be influenced by many factors. Irrespective of clinical factors such as age, stroke subtype, vascular stenosis, location of the injury and size of the affected area, inter individual variation in neuronal recovery is considerable. A number of me tabolic pathways are involved in the cerebral ischemic damage response and their activity may be modulated by variation in the genes that encode their various components. Our aim was to identify genetic variants and genes in fluencing the recovery process. We conducted a meta analysis of four different genome wide association studies. We included 1193 anterior territorial ischemic stroke Spanish cases with modified Rankin functional Scale measures at 3 months after stroke. Peripheral blood cell DNA was genotyped using the Illumina HumanCore Exome 24 BeadChip. Association analyses with outcome at 3 months after ischemic stroke were performed using SNPTEST and meta analyzed with METAL. Data was adjusted for clinical severity at discharge measured by Na tional Institute of Health Stroke Scale, hypertension, age, gender and princi pal components. Imputation was done using IMPUTE2.We discovered three genetic variants associated with 3 months outcome af ter ischemic stroke located in the INADL gene (<5.3E 08).We have identified a potential loci suggestive of being relevant for functio nal outcome and the recovery process after stroke. Follow up studies are warranted to validate these findings in other populations and to establish whether INADL can be a novel therapeutic target for the rehabilitation stra tegies.

Kutalik1; 1Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (IUMSP), Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), 1010 Lausanne, Switzerland, 2Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States. GWAS studies for longevity have found only two robustly replicating SNPs in and near APOE and FOXO3. Recent literature has improved power by looking at subsets of SNPs associated with specific diseases (Fortney et al, PLOS Genetics, Dec 2015). We improve on previous work in various aspects: (i) combined together the two largest longevity GWAS meta analysis studies ; (ii) used a large panel (190 studies) of genome wide association summary statistics and applied Mendelian Randomization to compute a causal esti mate of various traits/diseases on longevity. For example, using the top 15 (independent) LDL increasing SNPs we estimate that high LDL levels reduce the chance to live longer than 90 years ( 0.24 log odds / LDL SD unit, with p<3e 15).For each SNP we built priors for longevity effect by combining the SNPÃ¢ÂÂs ef fect on different diseases and the causal effect of these diseases on longevity. This way pleiotropic SNPs with even with small impact on individual traits can gain solid prior strength. We then calculated the Bayes factor for each marker and found that several loci gained genome wide significance thanks to the informative prior. Furthermore, our approach allowed for dissecting longevity heritability to genetic factors that act through the examined di seases and those that do not. This analysis revealed that the genetic deter minants of longevity strongly overlap with those that render us susceptible to diseases.

26403,"Human pigmentation is a striking aspect of human variability, showing re markable variation between individuals and populations. In recent years, association studies have identified a number of genes affecting common variation in pigmentation, highlighting the complex genetic architecture of this phenotype. The majority of these studies have been carried out in Euro pean related populations. To better understand the genetic architecture of human pigmentation variation, and its evolution, analyses in a wider range of populations are needed. We conducted a genome wide association scan in over 6,000 Latin Ame ricans for three pigmentation traits: skin, eye and hair color. Association testing used multivariate linear regression with an additive genetic model adjusting for: age, sex, and the first five principal components obtained from the SNP data. Our analyses revealed eleven independent genome wide significant signals of association with SNPs at 8 different genomic regions including a novel candidate region associated with skin pigmentation. We found that the as sociated SNP had a higher derived allele frequency in East Asians compared to Europeans and that it showed strong signals of positive selection in East Asians, consistent with the independent evolution of light skin in Eastern Eurasians. Ongoing functional analyses in skin melanocytes should help ex plain the biological basis of the association observed. In conclusion,we identified a novel region impacting on human skin pig mentation, providing further insights into the genetics and evolution of this complex trait.

26404,"Introduction: The X chromosome complicates much of genetic data analysis due to the fact that males carry only one copy. Even the most basic analysis, a test for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), is complicated by the hemi zygous males. Hitherto, the standard approach for testing X chromosomal markers has been to ignore the males. In this contribution we argue that males are relevant, because a difference in male and female allele frequency indicates that equilibrium does not hold. Materials and Methods: We develop chi square, likelihood ratio, exact and permutation tests for bi allelic markers at the X chromosome, assuming a multinomial distribution for the data considering all five genotype counts. We study the Type I error rate of the proposed tests, and compare this ap proach with the standard tests that exclude males. Empirical data from the GENEVA project on venous thromboembolism is used to assess the practical usefulness of the new methods. Results: Our X chromosomal exact test (with mid p value) is most promising because its rejection rate is most close to the nominal level under the HWE assumption. It shows better convergence to the nominal significance rate in comparison with the standard exact test which excludes males. The analysis of the GENEVA database reveals HWE test results can experience large chan ges in p value when the males are included. Conclusions: We have designed very basic statistical tools for the analysis of X chromosomal genotype data. Our methods are omnibus procedures that verify Hardy Weinberg proportions and equality of male and female allele frequencies in a single test.",2016
26405,"Introduction: Currently, donor/recipient (D R) matching is suboptimal. Be sides HLA, also other genetic factors play a role in graft rejection. We aim to identify genetic variation associated with rejection and mortality after heart transplantation. Methods: iGeneTRAiN is a large scale international consortium, which con sist of over 11,500 solid organ D R pairs, including over 1,000 heart trans plant D R pairs. We have conducted genome wide association studies for rejection and for mortality one year after transplantation, testing over 13 million variants in 605 recipients of European descent. We aim to perform association testing in a larger sample of heart transplant recipients and also cross organ including lung, liver, and kidney transplants, maximizing stati stical power to identify novel genetic variants. Importantly, we have high resolution data of the MHC region, including 4 digit HLA types. Results: We did not identify novel loci for rejection and mortality after heart transplantation. Fourteen loci reached a suggestive P value ( P<1x10 6). Conclusions: We aim to identify variants associated with mortality and re jection after heart transplantation. While our current sample of 605 indivi duals did not yield novel loci, we will increase the sample size to over 1,000 patients from multiple ancestries. Possible sources of genetic variation un derpinning rejection are homozygous deletion copy number variants span ning whole gene or exon regions and LoF variants ablating two copies of a given gene, resulting in incompatibility across the proteomes of donor and recipient. We ultimately aim to translate genetic data into clinical applicati ons such as more optimal genomic compatibility matching of D R pairs and immune suppression therapy dosing.",2016

26407,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), also known as aganglionic megacolon, is the most common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction, occurring in 1 out of 5000 newborns. It is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower intestinal tract. Despite its high heritability, genetic factors predisposing to HSCR remain elusive. So far association of three disease susceptibility lociÃ¢ÂÂRET, SEMA3 and NRG1Ã¢ÂÂ were detected from genome wide association analyses (GWASs) in Euro peans and Asians; however, much of the heritability remains unexplained. Here we present the largest trans ethnic meta analysis of HSCR (507 cases and 1191 controls), summarizing association results of all three published GWASs on the disease. By leveraging the trans ethnic differences in linkage disequilibrium, we fine mapped the three known loci and narrowed down the putatively causal variants to 99% credible sets. We observed no hete rogeneity in effect for RET and NRG1 across European and Asian ancestries but detected European specific association of a low frequency variant, rs80227144, in SEMA3 locus (OR,5.2, P,4.7x10 10 in European GWAS). Con ditional analysis on the lead SNPs further revealed a secondary association signal, corresponding to an Asian specific, low frequency missense variant encoding RET p. Asp489Asn (rs9282834, OR,20.3, conditional P,4.1x10 14 in Asian specific meta analysis). Effect of RET p. Asp489Asn appeared to be non additive, with an increased risk of HSCR under a compound heterozy gous state with the RET intron 1 enhancer. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the genetic architecture of HSCR and has profound implications for the future study design.",2016

Materials and methods: We included 1,998 participants representing iso lated island populations and 1,012 participants from mainland population. GWAS with meta analyses was performed for 11 infection related pheno types. Genotypic correlations between each phenotype associated SNPs from GWAS were used for network construction and enrichment analysis. We also searched for the overlap between correlated infectious phenotypes to find shared core genes and pathways. Results: Three genes reached a genome wide significance threshold HA PLN1 for meningitis in all cohorts, while IPMK for tuberculosis and TTC39B for hepatitis in island cohorts.

ORG 382Back to index DCN and CORIN to be marginally significant for tuberculosis, DMD for hepa titis and GALNT18 for systemic infections. Pathway analysis also revealed enrichment in genes outside of the immune system that may have plausible functions in various infection related outcomes. Conclusions: Network analysis can be a favourable post GWAS approach, especially to elucidate shared genes among correlated complex phenotypes. Some variants in infectious diseases may be wide spread, while others could be a result of genetic drift and isolation and possibly even local co adaptation.

26409,"Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic condition typically classified into CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD unclassified. Gene tics plays an important aetiological role in paediatric disease. We hypothe sise that patients with similar genetic mutation profiles may form distinct clusters in a machine learning model that can reflect or add to clinical infor mation/management. We applied machine learning models to whole exome sequencing (WES) data and constructed an alternative classification model for young IBD patients. Materials and methods: WES data from paediatric IBD cases (n,136) and controls (n,136) were used in model development and processed using customised scripts. Principal component analysis was used as an unsuper vised machine learning model for data visualisation and classification. Results: The inclusion of genomic variants in addition to clinical features in a machine learning model produced patient clusters distinct to those defined using clinical criteria only. Using KGGSeq scores and entropy calculations, we identified genes that discriminated paediatric IBD cases from controls. Furthermore, Jensen Shannon divergence based scoring system prioritises known causal genes and generates a restricted list of candidate genes that will be used to build a supervised model for further disease prediction and classification. Discussion: Our customised gene selection algorithm demonstrates impro ved case/control discriminatory power above models based on clinical data only and will form the basis for a progressive supervised model.

The collected data consists of clinical information, karyotype, results of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), DNA availability and the present status of a person (alive or dead). To all selected cases a request of informed consent was sent out, except dead persons. If the DNA sample was not available and/or CMA was not perfor med, the person was invited to counselling.

We found 325 (2.7 % of all karyotypes from blood) diagnosed cases with apparently balanced translocation or inversion. Most of these investigated patients were clinically healthy, except infertility problems and therefore we did not include them. In 35 cases (10.8 % of diagnosed cases) clearly abnor mal phenotype was noticed in addition to balanced aberration.

26411," Introduction: Estimating family relationships is a quality control step in Ge nome Wide Association Studies. Statistical methods as logistic regression require each individual to be independent. If there are any close relatives in the sample, the statistical models can generate misleading conclusions. Thus, identifying family relationships in genetic databases is recommended. Material and Methods: The GCAT Genomes for Life Cohort Study of the Ge nomes of Catalonia Project is based on the study of the role of genomic and epigenomic factors in the development of cancer and chronic diseases in the Catalonian population. Currently 3500 blood samples have been genotyped by SNP arrays methods for further analysis. In this contribution, we analy ze these samples with the aim of identifying family relationships. Identity by state (IBS) and identity by descent (IBD) alleles are considered for this purpose. We summarize the most used graphical methods in relatedness research and present two additional tools from the field of compositional data analysis. Results: Several related pairs are expected to be detected in the GCAT data base by plotting the mean versus the standard deviation of IBS alleles and by plotting the proportions of sharing 0, 1 or 2 IBS alleles. Plotting the probabi lities of sharing 0, 1 or 2 IBD alleles is used to confirm the supposed family relationships. The graphical tools used in compositional data analysis (ter nary diagrams and the isometric logratio plots) mainly confirm the expected inferred relationships. Conclusions: Graphics used in compositional data analysis such as ternary diagrams and logratio plots are useful in relatedness research.",2016

Results and Conclusions: Approximately 10 7 reads per sample were gene rated with an average of 100X depth coverage across the region of interest (1.7 Mb). A total of 16,253 variant sites were identified but association tests used genotypes from the 10,245 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms with call rates >95%, adjusting for five principal components to account for population stratification (lambda,1.001). Despite the reduced sample size, we identified 36 variants reaching genome wide significance (p<5x10 8), including one previously identified in the promoter region of MUC5B gene (rs35705950), and several other novel susceptibility variants.

26413,"Introduction: Genotype imputation is a key step in genome wide analysis in human genetics. Accuracy and coverage of imputed variants depend on the selection of SNP array for genotyping as well as the choice of the haplotype reference panel in imputation process. We developed a new SNP array (Japonica array) optimized for Japanese po pulation and evaluated the imputation accuracy of this array with various reference panels. Materials and Methods: Whole genome genotype imputation was conduc ted for the genotypes obtained from 131 individuals by Japonica array and other SNP arrays with cosmopolitan (international 1000 genomes) and population specific (1070 whole genomes of Japanese individuals) panels. The imputation accuracy and coverage were computed by comparing the imputed genotype with genotypes obtained by whole genome sequencing. Results: Better imputation performance was obtained for the Japonica array with the 1KJPN panel compared with other combinations of SNP array and reference panel. The genomic coverage of imputed genotypes (r2 >0.8) with the Japonica array reached around 97% and 67% for common (MAF > 5%) and low frequency SNPs (0.5% < MAF Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 5%), respectively. Conclusions: A combination of population specific SNP array with dense ha plotype collection improved both imputation accuracy and coverage.

26414,"Measures of urine electrolytes provide useful information on kidney func tion in people and are used routinely by clinicians as biomarkers of kidney damage. Genome wide association scans to identify significant loci asso ciations in these traits will give some indication of the underlying genetics which potentially will provide useful insights into kidney disease aetiology. We therefore performed a mixed model GWAS on 2934 individuals which formed part of a larger cohort of individuals genotyped in the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study. We analysed 8 phenotypes consi sting of measures of urine concentrations of sodium, potassium, chlorides, calcium, glucose, phosphorus, magnesium, and urine osmolarity. We further estimated whole genome and regional heritabilities for these phenotypes using GCTA and REACTA. We report a GWAS significant SNP (rs4574243, p value , 9.378709e 09) close to the RBMS3 gene on chromosome 3 associated with urine calcium concentration. The remaining traits had significant SNP associations at a suggestive level (p value < 1e 06) but not reaching GWAS significance. The regional heritability results in most of the traits mirrored their GWAS re sults by showing significant estimates on chromosomes with GWAS hits. The heritability estimates were very low for all the traits suggesting that these traits are under modest genetic control. The SNP hits identified for these traits lie within areas of the genome that have genes close by (<1Mb) which presents a useful avenue to be explored in future studies. There have been very sparse GWAS reports on these traits which make these findings uniquely important.",2016
26415,"Introduction: We investigated the frequency distribution and haplotype di versity of APOL1 and LCT variants associated with human African trypa nosomiasis (HAT) resistance and lactase persistence (LP), respectively, in populations from southern Angola to trace the spread of these genetic adap tations into southwestern Africa. Materials and Methods: We resequenced two fragments of the LCT enhancer and the APOL1 gene and genotyped flanking STRs in six groups from the An golan Namib with different subsistence traditions, and in other populations from Africa and Europe for comparative purposes. The age and selection coefficient of these variants were estimated. Results: LP in the Angolan Namib is represented by the 14010*C alle le, which is associated with a predominant haplotype shared with other southern and eastern African populations. While LP was more frequent in foragers than in pastoralists, the frequencies of the two APOL1 variants (G1 and G2) did not differ between the two groups. The G1 allele is mostly asso ciated with a single widespread haplotype. The G2 allele is linked to several haplotypes that are related to haplotypes found in African Bantu speaking populations. The putatively archaic G3 variant displayed more intra allelic diversity in Africa than in Europe. Conclusions: The LP adaptation was carried to southern Africa from eastern Africa, probably by non Bantu speaking pastoralists, although we could not confirm a direct link with groups speaking Khoe Kwadi family languages. The presence of APOL1 variants G1 and G2 is linked to the Bantu expansi ons. Our results suggest that the G3 variant was retained in modern humans by incomplete lineage sorting.",2016

Human genetic risk factors are definitely asso ciated to leprosy. The chromosomal region 10p13 was linked to leprosy and the GATA3 gene is a strong candidate to be part of this association. There fore, we tested if SNPs at GATA3 are associated to leprosy risk. The genotyping was made by allelic discrimination using TaqMan SNP as says (Applied Biosystems). All association analyses were conducted app lying logistic regression model using R software. We tested seven tag SNPs in a population from Mato Grosso State, Brazil (411 cases and 357 controls). The A allele of rs10905284 marker was asso ciated with leprosy resistance for CA genotype (OR 0.65; 95%CI 0.47 0.90; p,0.0099) and for A allele carriers (OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.50 0.92; p,0.0117). Then, we tested this association in another Brazilian population from SÃÂ£o Paulo State (511 cases and 380 controls). The association was confirmed for A allele carriers (OR 0.67; 95%CI 0.48 0.92; p,0.0151), heterozygous CA (OR 0.69; 95%CI 0.49 0.97; p,0.0344), and for homozygous AA (OR 0.61; 95%CI 0.40 0.93; p,0.0201).

26418,"Looking young for oneÃ¢ÂÂs age has been a desire since time immemorial. This desire is attributable to the belief that appearance reflects health and fe cundity. Indeed, perceived age predicts survival and associates with mole cular markers of aging such as telomere length. Understanding the under lying molecular biology of perceived age is vital for identifying new aging therapies amongst other purposes, but studies are lacking thus far. As a first attempt, we performed genome wide association studies (GWASs) of perceived facial age and wrinkling estimated from digital facial images by analyzing over 8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,693 elderly Dutch Europeans from the Rotterdam Study. The strongest genetic associations with perceived facial age were found for multiple SNPs in the MC1R gene (p<1ÃÂ10 7). This effect was enhanced for a compound hetero zygosity marker constructed from four pre selected functional MC1R SNPs (p,2.69ÃÂ10 12), which was replicated in 599 Dutch Europeans from the Leiden Longevity Study (p,0.042) and in 1,173 Europeans of the TwinsUK Study (p,3ÃÂ10 3). Individuals carrying the homozygote MC1R risk haplotype looked on average up to two years older than non carriers. This association was independent of age, sex, skin color, sun damage (wrinkling, pigmented spots), and persisted through different sun exposure levels. Hence, a role for MC1R in youthful looks independent of its known melanin synthesis function is suggested. Our study uncovers the first genetic evidence explai ning why some people look older for their age, and provides new leads for further investigating the biological basis of how old or young people look.",2016

Introduction: The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene is a key regulator of skin and hair colour. Certain MC1R polymorphisms, which cause a loss of protein function, have been associated with red hair colour (RHC) phe notype (red hair, fair skin and poor tanning response) and a higher risk of developing skin cancer. Although the MC1R protein is mainly expressed in melanocytes, it is also detected in neurons. We have observed that skin cells harbouring loss of function MC1R polymorphisms showed a deregu lation of genes involved in pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases (ParkinsonÃ¢ÂÂs disease (PD), AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease (AD) and HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs di sease (HD)). Material and Methods: We performed two case control studies to elucidate the role of MC1R in PD and AD. We sequenced the MC1R gene in 870 PD patients, 525 AD patients and 736 controls from Spain. We assessed the role of MC1R as a modifier factor on age of onset (AOO) in HD, sequencing MC1R in 600 HD patients. We analyzed all non synonymous MC1R variants with a minor allele frequency of at least 0.01.Results: We found evidence that the loss of function p. R160W MC1R poly morphism is marginally associated with PD (OR,2.10; Bonferroni corrected P,0.063) and that the p. V92M MC1R polymorphism increased risk of AD (OR: 1.97, P, 0.021). Furthermore, another loss of function polymorphism (p. R151C) showed an effect on AOO in HD (Bonferroni corrected P , 0.032), which explains 1.42% of the variance in AOO that cannot be accounted for by the expanded HD allele. Conclusion: Our results suggest that MC1R may play a role in neurodegene rative diseases .",2016

Two independent groups identified rare germline variants in POT1 that predispose to melanoma. Material and Methods: POT1 was sequenced by next generation sequencing (NGS) in 183 probands from Spanish melanoma prone families. Generated libraries, following Fluidigm unidirectional sequencing protocol, were se quenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Reads were aligned to the reference genome (GRCh37) using BWA mem. Variants were called with the GATK Haplotype Caller and quality filters were set as standard. Variant effect was predicted with the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor release 70. Missense variants or synonymous variants affecting splicing were sequenced by Sanger sequenc ing in the families detected for validation. Results: We detected by NGS 11 candidate variants in 13 probands, from the 119 samples that passed the quality control. DNA from patients be longing to 11/13 families was available. We detected by Sanger sequenc ing 3/9 candidate variants that could be tested in 3 melanoma prone fami lies: p. Gly404Val (c.1211G>T , ENST00000357628, ExAC frequency,0.014) which is predicted to be probably benign, suggesting it is a polymorphism; p. Ile78Thr (c.233T>C, ENST00000357628, ExAC frequency,0), which was previously detected in a melanoma patient and is predicted to be patho genic, and finally the p. Lys85Lys (c.255G>A, ENST00000357628, ExAC frequency,1e 05), which is located in a splicing site and furthermore coseg regates with melanoma within the family. Thus 2/119 (1.7%) families carry probably pathogenic variants in POT1.Conclusion: POT1 germline variants play a role in familial melanoma sus ceptibility in Spain.",2016

The genetic component of BT has only been explored by candidate gene studies with inconsistent results. Our objective ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 385Back to index was to uncover the genetic factors underlying BT using a hypothesis free genome wide approach. Our analysis strategy integrated a genome wide association study (GWAS) for BT followed by pathway analysis of GWAS outcomes using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method and epistasis analysis within BT asso ciated pathways. This strategy was applied to two large melanoma datasets with Hapmap3 imputed SNP data (~1 million SNPs): the French MELARISK study for discovery (966 cases) and the MD Anderson Cancer Center study (1,546 cases) for replication. While no marginal effect of individual SNPs was revealed through GWAS, three pathways, defined by gene ontology (GO) categories were significantly enriched in genes associated with BT (False Discovery Rate Ã¢ÂÂ¤5% in both studies): hormone activity, cytokine activity and myeloid cell differentiation. Epistasis analysis, within each significant pathway, identified a statistically significant interaction between CDC42 and SCIN SNPs (P interaction ,2.2x10 6, which met the overall multiple testing corrected threshold of 2.5x10 6). These two SNPs (and proxies) are strongly associated with CDC42 and SCIN gene expression levels and map to regulatory elements in skin cells. In conclusion, this study identified two novel genes influencing Breslow thickness. This finding has important biological relevance since CDC42 and SCIN proteins have opposite effects in actin dynamics, a key mechanism un derlying melanoma cell migration and invasion.

Materials and Methods: We analysed 714 samples originated from Wallachia (n, 226), Dobrudja (n,46), Moldavia (n,235) and Transylvania (n,207). The sequence of mtDNA control region for all samples was determined by sequencing the hypervariable segments HVS I and HVS II using two pair of primers.

There are many exi sting tools available for mixed models, although they might lack flexibility when a more complex model is sought. The proposed lme4qtl R package is an extension of the lme4 R package, and allows an arbitrary number of correlated random effects with any correlation structure defined by a cova riance matrix and/or grouping factors. A model of gene environment inter action is shown for illustration. Materials and Methods: Three main techniques were implemented. First, a correlated random effect, for example, defined via the double kinship ma trix, was introduced into the model via the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix and further update of the incidence matrix (method by Harville and Callanan).

All Pashtun tri bes studied here revealed high genetic diversity; that was comparable to the other Central Asian, Southeast Asian and European populations. The con figuration of genetic variation and heterogeneity further unveiled through Multidimensional Scaling, Principal Component Analysis, and phylogenetic analysis. The results revealed that the Pashtun is a composite mosaic of West Eurasian ancestry of numerous geographic origin.

We therefore focused our attention to the 5q31 locus, which contains several PsA associated genetic variants as well as a number of genes involved in the bone metabolism. On this subject, we studied the genomic variability of the 5q31 locus with a special focus to the region falling within 132,674,018 132,737,310 bp. From the in silico study of the region, 4 SNPs (rs2227282, rs2285700, rs10062446, rs2897442) were genotyped in 1526 subjects (PsA,500, PsV,426, controls,600). The rs2227282 was localized in IL 4, while the rs2285700, rs10062446, rs2897442 were positioned in KIF3A. All of them resulted associated with PsA (p,2.09601*10 5, p,3*10 3, p,5*10 3, p,1.2*10 4, respectively) but not with PsV.

26428,"Mutation is a fundamental biological process driving evolution and genera ting new disease mutations. Mutation rates depend on genomic context and adjacent nucleotides, but the exact effect of these predictors is unknown. Analyzing de novo variants provides an insufficient number of observations to obtain high resolution estimates and estimates from species divergence are biased by selection and biased gene conversion. Here, we present a novel approach to comprehensively assess predictors of mutability. We collect a dataset of over 36 million high quality singleton variants from 3765 whole genome sequences. These singletons arose very recently in the population, and are thus largely unaffected by confounding evolutionary factors. Based on these variants, we develop statistical models to predict the effect of genomic context and adjacent nucleotides on the mutation density and mutation rates at a single base resolution. We find strong evidence for heterogeneity in the mutation rates of short sequence motifs up to 4bp upstream and downstream from the mutating site and estimate up to 60 fold difference between non CpG motifs within a single mutation category. This heterogeneity provides insight into the biological processes creating germline mutations. The distribution of short motifs alone explains over 70% of variance in singleton density, implicating sequence context as a key determinant of mutability. The single base muta tion rate is further mediated by local genomic features, such as replication timing and histone marks. We also demonstrate that site specific mutation rates can provide evidence for pathogenicity that is largely independent of existing measures.",2016

We found a signal of positive selection in non Africans as sociated with the derived allele of an intronic variant (rs10180970) which is the most differentiated variant between Africans and non Africans in this gene. To elucidate the environmental pressure responsible for this signal and investigate possible connections with ichthyosis, we analysed data obtained from 56 ancient hominins.

It was created the database of patients inquirers, elaborated based on STEPS survey of NCDs in Moldova, comprising over 250 parameters from each of the participants. There was used the approach to identify SNPs related to the biochemical parameters and SNPs with established expression QTL association that po tentially can be more informative biomarkers in disease risk assessment. In the first instance, SNPs related to Lipid parameters from GWAS Catalog were obtained. The results related to research of treatment effects, compli cations and non European ancestry individuals were removed. There were determined 298 individual SNPs, separated in 3 groups, by reported genes: 1SNP 1 trait, 1SNP Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 2 traits, Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 2 SNPs 1 trait. None of the SNPs located on chromosome 21, X and Y were identified. Also, only one SNP , located on chromosome 13, associated with BRCA2 gene was present. All selected SNPs were searched through eQTL Browser returning three results (rs10889353, rs2338104, rs646776, p value < 10 5) associated with DOCK7, KCTD10 and CELSR2 genes, respectively.

Introduction: Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts are one of the most common birth defects, having multifactorial etiology involving both genetic and en vironmental factors. Linkage analyses and genome wide association stud ies have identified several genomic susceptibility regions for this orofacial anomaly. Genetic predisposition to nonsyndromic orofacial clefts is ethnic ity dependent, and the genetic basis of susceptibility to this birth defect likely varies among populations. In the present study 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been pre viously identified by genome wide association studies in other populations were analysed for an association with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts in a Slovak population. Materials and Methods: Nucleotide variants rs642961 in IRF6, rs987525 in 8q24, rs7078160 in 10q25 and rs227731 in 17q22 were genotyped in 199 patients with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts and 157 unaffected controls. All variants of interest were analyzed by high resolution melting analysis after the real time PCR on Eco Real Time PCR System. Results: Significant associations with nonsyndromic orofacial cleft risk were observed for rs642961 and rs227731. Polymorphism rs642961 increased the risk when analyzed under a dominant model (GA + AA vs. GG: OR,1.66; 95% CI 1.06 2.60). Polymorphism rs227731 was significantly associated with an increased risk under a recessive model (CC vs. CA + AA: OR,1.71; 95% CI 1.03 2.83). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that polymorphisms rs642961 in IRF6 and rs227731 in 17q22 are associated with an increased risk of nonsyn dromic orofacial clefts and thus might act as a risk factor in Slovak popula tion.

26432,"Introduction: Osteoarthritis of the hand (OA) is to a large extend genetical ly determined. However only one locus has been found to be associated to hand OA. We aimed to identify novel genes and pathways involved in the aetiology of hand OA, by performing a genome wide association study. Materials and methods: We have performed a GWAS on 12,784 individuals (discovery:8743, replication:4011) using a quantitative bilateral hand OA phenotype, summing all KL scores of the hand joints for both hands (min: 0, max: 120). RNA sequencing of 96 human primary chondrocytes was used for allele specific expression analysis of GWAS top hits. Results: After discovery, replication and joint meta analysis one SNP rea ched genome wide significance (P,1.8*10 15). The risk allele of this vari ant associates with a higher KL sum score(ÃÂKL sum,8) compared to the reference. The variant is located near the Matrix Gla protein (MGP) gene, which is a calcification inhibitor, and is in high(r2>0.8) linkage disequili brium with a nonsynonymous and a 5Ã¢ÂÂUTR variant in MGP . We found MGP to be highly expressed in human chondrocytes. Additionally these variants cause for allelic imbalance of MGP gene expression in human chondrocytes. The risk allele was consistently lower expressed compared to the reference allele (P<0.001).Conclusions: We identified coding variants in MGP , which are genome wide associated to hand OA, and cause for decreased MGP expression. Carriers of the risk alleles seem more prone to develop articular cartilage calcification, a well described hallmark of OA. MGP function is dependent on vitamin K, indicating vitamin K as a potential therapeutic target for OA.",2016

Variations in PTH levels are under genetic control and influenced by environmental factors. The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants and environmental factors underly ing parathyroid function by studying PTH levels in healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines PTH using genome wide ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 388Back to index data. Methods: PTH was measured in blood plasma of 1012 participants from Split, Croatia (aged 18 85). To identify variants associated with PTH, ge nome wide association study was performed using linear regression analy sis and an additive model, with adjustments for age, gender and relatedness. To assess the influence of various environmental factors on PTH, nonpara metric tests were used due to non normal distribution of PTH levels. Results: We identified two potentially associated loci: rs28524851 on chromosome 22 in FAM19A5 gene (p,5.06*10 7,ÃÂ², 0.33,SE,0.06) and rs6688219 on chromosome 1 in CASZ1 gene (p,7.96*10 7,ÃÂ², 0.94,SE,0.19). Among females, PTH showed positive association with BMI and systolic blood pressure while smoking and alcohol consumption were negatively associated. Diastolic blood pressure was positively associated with PTH among males. Serum calcium levels and bone density showed negative association with PTH. Conclusions: We found two potentially associated loci that need to be con firmed in a replication study. One of those is located in CASZ1 gene which is known to be associated with cardiac phenotypes. These results also indicate that environmental factors have influence on parathyroid function. *This work has been supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project 1498.",2016
26434,"Parent of origin effect (POE) occurs when the allelic effect on phenotype de pends on whether the allele is inherited from mother or father. POE can be mediated through several mechanisms, such as genomic imprinting, trans generational effects, in utero effects and the maternal environment. The aim of this study was to identify POE of common variants in NMR metabolites. We considered 5,853 individuals from Estonian Biobank (EGCUT) for 82 NMR metabolites. Individuals were imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (March 2012 release). POE analysis was performed using POE method in QUICKTEST using markers with MAF Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 1%, info Ã¢ÂÂ¥ 0.8. We observed evidence of POE for 7 metabolites (p<5x10 8) and are replicating these findings in an independent dataset. Identified variants are associated with lipids and lipoproteins. Two of the found variants (rs1330350; rs189194743) located in TNC and PTPRD genes, which are associated with signaling molecules regulating a variety of cellular processes, such as neuronal regeneration, mitotic cycle, cell growth, neurons and axons migration during development. These regu latory features provide normal embryonic growth and therefore it suggests that identified POE may be mediated through genomic imprinting. This idea motivated us to perform further steps, such as allele specific expression analysis, epigenome wide association analysis with further replication in an independent cohort and methylation QTL to investigate mechanisms un derlying POE and its association with genomic imprinting. We believe our results will contribute to uncovering complex relations between genetic va riants and common traits and help to reveal some of the hidden heritability.

26435,"GWAS based pathway analyses aim to identify biological pathways invol ved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of complex diseases. So far, these me thods have generally focused on summary statistic results and identified the pathways that have causal effects at the whole sample level. Although existing approaches can highlight the involvement of causal pathways, they could not reveal the heterogeneous pathogenic mechanisms across cases for a disease. Here, we develop a new method that utilizes individual level genotype data to test for heterogeneity in the enrichment of risk alleles across different pathways for each individual it does this by calculating polygenic risk scores specific to different pathways for each case individual. Our method aims to identify heterogeneity in the genetic basis of complex diseases, as well as potentially increase the overall power to identify cau sal pathways. Here we test this method on simulated case control data in which the cases have heterogeneous causal pathways to assess its power to detect heterogeneity in pathway aetiology, and also compare its power for overall pathway detection with existing summary statistic based methods. We exemplify the performance of our method to identify heterogeneity in pathways for several complex diseases, including schizophrenia and BMI, and compare our results with those from several well established pathway analysis methods.",2016

We used Illumina 770K HumanOmniExpress 12v1.0 array data of 295 un related individuals of six ethnolinguistic groups of Lithuanian population (South AukÃÂ¡taiÃÂiai (SA), East AukÃÂ¡taiÃÂiai (EA), West AukÃÂ¡taiÃÂiai (WA), South ÃÂ½emaiÃÂiai (SÃÂ½), West ÃÂ½emaiÃÂiai (WÃÂ½), North ÃÂ½emaiÃÂiai (NÃÂ½)). NeON R pak kage was used to estimate Ne and divergence time. Estimated Ne ranged from 4940 in the WÃÂ½ group to 5314 in the WA group. According to divergence time, the WÃÂ½ was earliest diverging group. The lon gest divergence time was observed between the WÃÂ½ and SA (9950 ya), and between the WÃÂ½ and EA (9650 ya), whereas the most recent separation oc curred between the NÃÂ½ and SÃÂ½ groups (4775 ya).It is ascertained that the overall effective population size of ÃÂ½emaiÃÂiai is less in comparison with the overall of AukÃÂ¡taiÃÂiai.

26437,"History of Hungarians, Roma and Turkic groups could have overlapped se veral times during their demographic activities. Ancestors of Hungarians, migrating from the Ural region to the Carpathian basin, were in contact with nomadic Turkic tribes. It is also known that significant part of recent Hunga ry fell to Ottoman control between in the 16th Century for 150 years. Migra tion of Roma included also the Anatolian Island. Roma arrived to Hungary in the 15th century, fleeing from the conquering campaigns of the Ottoman Empire. Roma were a notable ethnic group of the Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th Century already. According to these historical events, relationship of Hungarians and Roma with Turks was investigated based on genome wide single nucleotide poly morphism (SNP) data. Clustering software, utilizing algorithmic and model based approaches, formal tests of admixture, and identity by descent (IBD) segment analyzes were carried out attempting to shed light to the conclusi on of these demographic events in a genome wide basis. We attempted also to measure the impact of the Ottoman rule in East Central Europe. We confirmed that admixture of Roma and Turks during the Ottoman rule is also significant, and our estimation shows a proportion of 66% of total Turkic ancestry in Roma, compared to their Northwestern Indian ancestry. We estimate that Hungarians have an average IBD share length of 0.69Mb with Turks, which is significant, compared to other populations under Ot toman rule. Our analyses confirmed that Ottoman occupation leaved detectable impact in East Central Europe including Hungarians, and also shaped the ancestry of the Romani people.

26438,"DenmarkÃ¢ÂÂs genetic history has never been studied in detail. In this work, we analysed genetic and anthropometrical data from ~800 Danish students as part of an outreach activity promoting genomic literacy in secondary edu cation. DNA analysis revealed remarkable homogeneity of the Danish po pulation after discounting contributions from recent immigration. This ho mogeneity was reflected in PCA and AMOVA, but also in more sophisticated LD based methods for estimating admixture. Notwithstanding DenmarkÃ¢ÂÂs homogeneity, we observed a clear signal of Polish admixture in the East of the country, coinciding with historical Polish settlements in the region be fore the Middle Ages. In addition, Denmark has a substantially smaller effec tive population size compared to Sweden and Norway, possibly reflecting further lack of strong population structure. None of these three Scandinavi an countries seems to have suffered a depression due to the Black Death in the Middle Ages. Finally, we used the studentsÃ¢ÂÂ genetic data to predict their adult height after training a novel prediction algorithm on public summary statistics from large GWAS.

26439,"Background: The genetic structure of human populations varies throughout the world, being influenced by migration, admixture, natural selection and genetic drift. Human population structure has first been investigated at broad scales, between and within continents. Currently researchers focus on finer scales, examining genetic structure within countries or regions. Characterising such genetic variation is of interest as it provides insight into demographical history and informs research on disease association studies, especially the ones focusing on rare variants. Results: We genotyped 456 individuals from Western France Atlantic Coast, from FinistÃÂ¨re to VendÃÂ©e, with at least three of their grandparents born within a 15 kilometres distance using Axiom CEU Chip. Principal Compo nents analysis revealed that individuals from the same departments form clusters and we observed a high correlation between geographical position and components (p value < 2e 16). The main geographical barrier in the region is Loire River. Many independent methods support the hypothesis that Loire River is also a genetic barrier. The two groups of individuals, from north or south of Loire, are well differentiated along PC1 axis. ADMIXTURE estimated different ancestry proportions for the two groups. The first split of hierarchical clustering returned by fineSTRUCTURE, and the one based on normalized counts of identity by descent segments is between north and south of Loire. Conclusion: We here report both evidence for isolation by distance and exi stence of a genetic barrier, the Loire River. The discovered fine scale popula tion structure may have consequences in association analyses, especially for rare variants which tend to be geographically clustered.",2016
26440,"Introduction: Quantitative traits are generally changed with time. Longitu dinal genetic studies with multiple measurements offer a valuable resource to examine how genetic and environmental factors that may affect complex traits over time. However, most of genetic studies of quantitative traits using longitudinal data did not take into account genetic effects that may interact with age. Fan et al. (2012) develop penalized spline based mixed model to estimate the temporal trend of mean effects and genetic effects. Neverthe less, their simulation study did not consider gene time interaction. Methods: We conducted a simulation study to investigate the performance of spline based mixed model and three parametric mixed models on the set tings of gene time interactive effects as well as gene time invariant effects. This spline based mixed model was also applied to analyze the association between the Matsu Community Based Integrated Screening (MA CIS) pro gram longitudinal blood pressure data and six single nucleotide polymor phisms in the KLOTHO gene. Results: Our simulation study showed that spline based mixed model had better power and less bias square than other parametric mixed models for both gene time invariant effect and gene time interactive effect. For the MA CIS data, we found the haplotype GGACTA was associated with blood pressu re and the SNP rs1207568 and haplotype AGCCCA had gene time interactive effects with blood pressures. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the spline based mixed model is more flexible than the parametric mixed mo dels as it could conveniently capture the pattern of relationship between quantitative traits and genetic markers.",2016

The current study aims towards building a SNP based panel for Indian po pulations for forensic HID. Methods: A bioinformatic approach was utilized to shortlist SNPs from pu blic databases which were subsequently genotyped from the salivary DNA of ~460 unrelated adult volunteers in Indian populations using GoldenGa teÃÂ® Genotyping Assay (Illumina, Inc, USA). Based upon the distribution of the alleles in the tested populations (grouped as North, East, West and South India) the SNPs with most desired characteristics were accepted. Results: Screening public databases from worldwide populations led us to shortlist a panel of 270 SNPs which were genotyped in Indian populations and finally, 2 4 SNPs from each autosome were selected to devise a panel of 70 SNPs. Random match probability (RMP) of the panel was ~10 29 for all the regions which was higher than panels currently available for forensic DNA profiling.

26444,"Narrow sense heritability (hÃÂ²) estimates for complex traits based on com mon SNPs are generally substantially lower than estimates obtained from the classical twin design, a disparity referred to as the Ã¢ÂÂstill missing heri tabilityÃ¢ÂÂ. By estimating the variance components of a SNP based ACE model in a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, we show that imperfect tagging of genetic variation by common SNPs does not fully account for the large difference between SNP based and classical twin study hÃÂ² estimates for human height and BMI. However, a SNP based model that accounts for high order epistatic effects provides hÃÂ² estimates for human height and BMI that agree with previously reported SNP based estimates; 47% for height (SE,4%) and 28% for BMI (SE,5%). Moreover, the difference between hÃÂ² estimates from the epistatic model and the classical twin design coincide with the theoretically expected bias in twin study estimates under a high order epistatic model. Given that the twin study assumption of equal envi ronment for monozygotic and dizygotic twins holds, these results provide evidence that twin study hÃÂ² estimates are biased upwards due to the mi sattribution of epistatic effects to additive effects in the classical ACE model. The bias due to epistasis is able to explain the majority of the still missing heritability for human height and BMI.",2016

As both the number of individuals and number of genetic markers increase with the onslaught of new e.g. large scale sequencing studies, more subtle and likely regional genetic varia tion patterns will be captured, enabling the elucidation of (and necessitating accounting for) genetic differences at increasingly finer geographic scales. I demonstrate how using haplotype information, which exploits correlation patterns among neighbouring Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) or other variants, increases precision to infer genetic relatedness and ancestry over the far more commonly used programs that ignore this information. In particular I highlight how incorporating haplotype information identifies genetic patterns at fine geographic scales, e.g. within a country, where stan dard approaches fail. I describe new statistical methodology that infers the ancestry and relatedness of individuals by comparing haplotype patterns among an arbitrarily large number of world wide groups, while accounting for sampling artefacts such as unequal group sample sizes and readily ac commodating DNA samples from ancient human remains.

After reviewing the cases the genetics team associated with the advocacy group proposed to screen another recently defined rare entity, Ã¢ÂÂautosomal recessive nail dysplasiaÃ¢ÂÂ, and found a new mutation in a causative gene, FZD6, within 2 months. Discussion: The role of patient advocacy groups in human genetics is un deniable. Apart from providing support for patients, their determination may have saved 5 10 years in treatment discoveries of some rare diseases. Nowadays, with the advance of genetic technologies we often forget them except for some devoted physicians and scientists. However, patient advo cacy groups are experts in their rare disorder and can play a crucial role, as in our cases in determining a correct diagnosis and preventing unnecessary tests and/or treatment. Therefore, it can be beneficial to consult with dis ease advocacy groups at early stages of diagnostic odysseys. ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

26451,"Introduction: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (aCGH) allows whole genome analysis at a higher resolution than was previously possible by karyotyping alone. This has resulted in the increasing detection of am biguous results, termed Ã¢ÂÂVariants of Uncertain SignificanceÃ¢ÂÂ (VOUS). VOUS results pose communication challenges to clinicians and families. Currently there are no universal guidelines for aCGH result communication. This study evaluates the counselling practice of aCGH results of differing pathogenici tes. Methods: This observational study included 75 paediatric patients who had aCGH testing at the Yorkshire Regional Genetics Service, UK. Cases were ran domly selected from three result categories; Clinically Significant (n,24), VOUS Likely Benign (n,25) and VOUS Uncertain (n,26). Data regarding the communication of results was collected from patient records. Descriptive statistics and FisherÃ¢ÂÂs Exact test were applied to the data. Results: Pre test counselling regarding the possibility of a VOUS result was documented in 5.3% of cases. There was a significant difference in the mode of result disclosure between categories (p,0.001). 75.0% of Clinically Signi ficant results were disclosed via face to face consultation and letter, whe reas 74.5% of VOUS results were disclosed via letter only. 23.5% of those receiving VOUS results were advised to re contact genetics services in the future. Conclusions: Communication of aCGH results varies according to their pa thogenicity. To standardise practice, all patients should be counselled about the possibility of a VOUS result. The effect of mode of disclosure on result comprehension should be studied further. Patients receiving VOUS results should be advised to re contact genetics services to seek new information.",2016
26452,"Introduction: Individuals with BRCA1/2 gene faults are a unique group with specific support needs. Genetic Alliance Australia (GA), a peak umbrella or ganisation, was approached by a consumer and a genetic counsellor in 2001, seeking support for BRCA1/2 gene fault carriers. The outcome was an an nual BRCA1/2 information day hosted by GA for 15 years, an alternative to traditional support group models. GA documented how this unique model evolved with patientsÃ¢ÂÂ support needs over time. Method: Qualitative and quantitative data was collected and analysed from completed evaluations over 15 years. PatientsÃ¢ÂÂ perspectives and suggestions for improvements/topics for the day were recorded and logistical elements analysed. Results: Evaluation results showed on average 73% of annual attendees were new. GA continually revaluated and modified the format based on feedback, catering to new and repeat attendees. Participants consistently responded positively to the diversity of information presented and appreci ated opportunities to ask health professionals questions in a non clinical setting. Participants appreciated hearing personal stories and embraced the opportunity to communicate and share their experiences with others who were at different points in their journey with BRCA1/2 gene faults. Life changing decisions and challenges were openly shared. Partnership with fa milial cancer genetic counsellors and consumers has grown from a consulta tive group into a cohesive and integrated partnership. Conclusion: The BRCA1/2 Information Day provides a non clinical, face to face approach focusing on mutual aid amongst participants. It has evolved into a unique hybrid of support group and information day models, driven by consumersÃ¢ÂÂ needs, demonstrating its portability.",2016
26453,"Approximately half of BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers lack significant family history, and would only be identified through screening. Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) po pulation is a model for screening, given high prevalence (1/40) and testing sensitivity (>95%) of three common mutations. Towards implementation, we aim to examine the impact of excluding pre test genetic counseling (GC) in the population screening setting. Healthy AJ women age > 25 years are randomized to two pre test arms: written information only (WI) vs. GC. Post testing, GC is provided to high risk non carriers and to all carriers. Psychosocial outcomes (satisfaction, stress, personal perceived control (PPC), knowledge) are assessed one week (Q1) and 6 months (Q2) post testing. Among the first 749 participants (mean age 46 years), we identified 11 car riers (1.5%). Only 3/11 carriers had significant family history. Post testing, 95% of GC and 94% of WI participants report being satisfied with testing. Stress (IES) scores were similar in both groups. At Q1, PPC scores and know ledge were higher in GC (p,.005; p,.0001), At Q2, only PPC scores remained higher in GC: 1.39 vs. 1.25 in WI (p,.02). Carriers had higher PPC and know ledge than non carriers. At Q2, carriersÃ¢ÂÂ stress level was higher (14.9 vs. 5.3, p,.0006), as expected. Screening would identify substantially more carriers (regardless of family history). Compared to WI, pre test GC provides a mild, temporary, increase in knowledge, accompanied by a greater sense of control. Forgoing pre test GC may be an alternative for screening, particularly if alternative methods for imparting knowledge are explored. Supported by the breast cancer research foundation.",2016
26454,"Cancer genetics is a critical specialty that is continuously advancing; genetic counsellors must be in sync with these advancements. Currently, multi gene testing is being adapted into the genetic counselling setting. The Ã¢ÂÂhot topicÃ¢ÂÂ of an increased likelihood of variant results has been explored previously. However, research surrounding VUS reclassification is lacking. This study aimed to identify current practices of cancer genetic counsellors with re gard to variant reclassification. Method: This study utilised an online survey. SAS 9.4 was employed for quantitative data, qualitative data was analysed for themes. Results: We determined that cancer genetic counsellors handle the reclas sification of VUS results in a unified manner. 95% of respondents (n , 209) discuss reclassification with their patients upon receiving a VUS result. Sim ilarly, 95% of respondents (n , 209) will sometimes or always make a plan to communicate VUS reclassifications should they arise in the future. The majority (97%) (n , 183) indicated that the protocol for re contacting pa tients with a VUS reclassification wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be different from what they had used for single gene analysis. Varying opinions existed on whether practice guidelines are necessary, a number expressed concerns surrounding liabil ity issues and the feasibility of implementing recommendations across dif ferent institutions. Conclusions: Study findings indicate most genetic counsellors are utilising unified practices when handling variant reclassifications. A proportion felt guidance for certain areas relating to variant reclassifications are necessary. Given the coming wave of reclassifications from multiple collaborative ef forts to reclassify VUS results future research must explore in depth the is sues identified in this project.",2016

Introduction: In 1996, the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Network organized the first large international external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for CFTR ge netic testing. The scheme evolved from a paper based six sample EQA to au tomated electronic data collection for three samples. Originally, EQA forms were distributed by fax and post, later by e mail. Since 2004, an online sub mission system and database have revolutionized the workflow. Materials and Methods: Participants receive purified DNA samples, since 1999 accompanied by mock clinical cases. Written reports as would be sent to the requesting clinician have to be submitted. Hence the entire analytical process is evaluated, including genotyping, report content, clinical interpre tation and the correct use of HGVS nomenclature. Genotype and report re sults are scored against predefined criteria by a group of expert assessors. Persistent poor performers (unsuccessful in the current year and at least once in the two previous years) are notified and expert support for correc tive actions is offered. Results: In 1996, 35% of laboratories made genotyping errors. Within four years, this number decreased to 10%, and by 2015 it was down to 3%. The percentage of interpretation errors or risk calculation errors varies depen ding on the complexity of the cases. Longitudinal analysis shows that repea ted participation improves clinical interpretation. Conclusions: Continued EQA participation is advised to further improve testing quality. Interpretation and risk calculation are still prone to errors in more challenging cases. Consequences for poor performance are lacking and are suggested to be implemented by the government to ensure patient safety.",2016

However, only a minority of relatives access screening or genetic testing, which is partly due to lack of knowledge about their personal risk. We are studying information preferences to develop ways for patients to share information online. Using a cross sectional survey design, we have collected data on patient preferences via an online questionnaire. We are recruiting patients via cha rity websites, genetics clinics and colorectal clinics. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data from free text re sponses were analysed for recurrent themes. Preliminary results indicate that most (47/60) would like information in other ways; via email, websites or social media, but also through follow up appointments (33/55). Respon dents wanted more information about genetic testing (31/59), healthy life style (24/59) and talking to children (20/59). Initial data illustrate a diverse experience of familiesÃ¢ÂÂ access to appropriate advice and screening. There is an appetite for more comprehensive information and a recurring theme of Ã¢ÂÂhaving to fight for screening all the timeÃ¢ÂÂ. Updated results will be given. Results indicate a pragmatic approach is needed to help relatives share information.

26458,"A 31 year old woman was seen for genetic counselling in our Genetics Cen tre. She had questions concerning her risk of having children with Cri du Chat Syndrome (CdCS). Her older brother had been diagnosed with Cri du Chat syndrome, confirmed on a 46,XY,del5p karyotype done 30 years ago. CdCS is characterized by a high pitched monochromatic cry, microcephaly, mainly severe psychomotor deficiency and other variable clinical features. The incidence is about 1:30,000 live born infants. CdCS is usually due to de novo 5p deletion. For the brother, the diagnosis was clinically suggested by the paediatrician soon after birth and then confirmed on a standard karyo type. Genetic counselling seemed straightforward but we nonetheless ordered chromosome studies in the patient, including FISH with a 5p subtelomeric probe. FISH analysis revealed 5p duplication / 4q deletion in our patient who has a normal phenotype. This result led us to reconsider the information originally given to the family. We ordered parental karyotype analysis which revealed an apparently ba lanced t(4;5)(q35;p15.5) translocation in the mother. CdCS patients with an inherited unbalanced chromosomal rearrangement have been reported and represent about 5% of CdCS patients. Generally speaking and especially in CdCS, when the index caseÃ¢ÂÂs karyotype was done more than 20 years ago or when the parents have not had chromosome studies including FISH, repeat chromosome studies in the index case and parental chromosome studies are recommended.",2016
26459,"Cystic Fibrosis is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders af fecting Caucasians. To date, more than 2000 changes in the CFTR gene have been reported (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/) with the clinical conse quences of some still being unproven. In an attempt to provide with better genotype phenotype correlations CFTR2 database (http://www.cftr2.org/) has been created. CFTR2 database provides information about what is cur rently known about the clinical signs and symptoms associated with specific CFTR mutations. In some cases where there is not enough clinical informa tion the mutation is described as having varying clinical consequences.

26460,"Introduction: Inherited diseases are usually associated with specific disease associated gene sets. Targeted resequencing of such gene sets can be ap plied by custom designed gene panels or by WES, the latter in combination with software selection of the genes of interest. Custom panel sequencing has the advantage that the coverage for all genes can be easily optimized. Materials and Methods: We have evaluated both sequencing strategies for gene coverage, mutation calling accuracy, false positive rate and copy num ber variation(CNV) determination for several diseases such as lymphedema, cardiac disease, metabolic disease, dementia, eye diseases and others, each with different numbers of genes. CNV detection of 1 exon deletions were evaluated using the Ã¢ÂÂhidden Markov modelÃ¢ÂÂ.Results: Custom sequence captures optimized for evenly distributed cove rage of genes of interest easily cover over 99% of the genes of interest with at least 30 unique reads. In comparison WES reaches a maximum of 95%. Furthermore, 1 exon deletions and duplications could be reliably identified in custom sequence captures, but not in WES. Novel identified mutations for different selected diseases will be presented. Conclusions: We show that for defined set of genes, custom panel sequen cing is preferred over exome sequencing because of optimal coverage, calling accuracy, lower false positive rate, less unclassified variants and secondary findings and CNV detection. In conclusion, custom panel sequen cing of selected sets of genes is recommended for DNA diagnostics where highly reliable results are crucial. These custom gene panel tests can be per formed at considerably lower costs.",2016
26461,"Background. Evaluating a patient in the genetics clinic aims at finding a di agnosis that would explain their full clinical presentation. In some cases the patientÃ¢ÂÂs diagnosis remains undefined; in others it does not explain all the patientÃ¢ÂÂs findings. As clinicians are often bound by a Ã¢ÂÂsingle disorderÃ¢ÂÂ para digm, diagnosing multiple genetic conditions requires a heightened sense of awareness. We aim to raise awareness to the Ã¢ÂÂdouble diagnosisÃ¢ÂÂ phenom enon and to share our experience. Procedure. Patients (n,14) were seen over the last decade at The Genetics Institutes at Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, Beilinson hospital and Schneider ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel, and Boston ChildrenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. All patients were clinically evaluated by their geneticists, and underwent diagnostic genetic analyses (Table 1).Conclusions. With most patients, the primary physician is the pivotal figure that facilitates their care; he is best acquainted with the patient and should be the first to question a diagnosis that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt explain the patientÃ¢ÂÂs full clin ical picture. The phenomenon of double diagnosis is bound to expand in the era of next generation sequencing, as it continues to grow in clinical, rather than just research, settings. We recommend physicians to question every diagnosis and see whether it indeed explains all of the patientsÃ¢ÂÂ symptoms, or should they continue the evaluation for a more accurate and complete diagnosis or diagnoses.

26462,"Introduction: Although preconception carrier screening for multiple disor ders is becoming more widely available, only few studies have been done to evaluate such kind of screening. This study assessed experiences with car rier screening in a Dutch founder population in which four severe recessive disorders frequently occur. Methods: In a special outpatient clinic, individuals from the founder popu lation were offered screening for the four disorders simultaneously. Those who attended between September 2012 and June 2014 were asked to par ticipate in our evaluation study. Questionnaire(s) were completed by 182 counselees before and after counselling, and after receiving test results. Results: Although knowledge after counselling increased (p<0.001), still 10% (compared to 34% before counselling) mistakenly thought that there is an increased risk of having an affected child if both parents are carrier of different disorders. Most participants (97%) could recall their test results correctly. 63% Felt worried waiting for their results, but anxiety levels re turned to normal afterwards. 4% (2/52) Of the carriers felt less healthy after knowing their results. Participants did not regret testing (97%) and would recommend screening to others (97%). Eight carrier couples were identified who all made reproductive decisions based on their test results. Conclusion: Individuals from the Dutch founder population who were of fered screening were very satisfied. Although familiarity with genetic di seases is high in this population, knowledge is still not optimal. No adverse psychological effects were demonstrated.

Methods: We recruited 430 female relatives of women diagnosed with bre ast cancer Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 45 years old. Perceived risk was measured with one item asses sing perceived chances of getting breast cancer. We calculated 5 year and lifetime Gail scores, and evaluated barriers to using genetic services. Results: Participants were 43.4 (ÃÂ±11.9) years old; 80% self identified as White/Other and 20% as Black. The average 5 year and lifetime Gail scores were 1.55% and 16.42%, respectively. Average perceived risk was 4.67(ÃÂ±1.99), meaning Ã¢ÂÂsave as average.Ã¢ÂÂ From 334 participants with lifetime Gail risk >average 81.1% underestimated their risk; from 74 participants with lifetime Gail risk Ã¢ÂÂ¤average 5.4% overestimated their risk. Only 33 women had genetic services and 13 had testing. Lifetime Gail scores were higher for those who had genetic services (p,0.0043). Logistic regression modeling will explore predictors of using cancer genetic services. Conclusion: Women with family history of early onset breast cancer have Ã¢ÂÂ¥average risk for the disease. Our study adds weight to understanding use of cancer genetic services and improving risk communication and manage ment strategies.",2016

This requires appropriate skills and knowledge to deliver care that addres ses patient needs and maximises use of health resources. The aim of the Gen Equip project is to improve primary care of patients with genetic/ge nomic conditions. Via a partnership between expert patients and specialists in adult education, primary care and genetics, we are implementing free, online education in genomic healthcare for European primary care practi tioners. To date, we have undertaken a systematic review of genetic education for primary care and developed an educational curriculum for European pro fessionals. Expert advice indicated that an approach based on questions as ked by patients in primary care was likely to be perceived as relevant to the target learner group. Ten case based modules set in primary care have been prepared, these can be accessed online (https://www.primarycaregenetics.org/) by any health professional and include pre and post test module tests. Topics include familial cancer, familial hypercholestrolaemia, inherited car diac conditions, developmental delay and reproductive issues.

26473,"Introduction: Cases of double heterozygosity caused by the presence of mu tations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are unusual. To date, the vast majo rity of reported cases are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent being rare in other populations. Clinical presentation of double heterozygotes individuals is varied and has a similar phenotype and age of onset as carriers of a single mutation. We report a case of double heterozygosity in the Chilean populati on with early age of onset compared to members of the same family carriers of a single mutation. General Description: Pretest genetic counseling and commercial high risk breast cancer panel was offered in view of probandÃÂ´s personal history of breast and ovarian cancer and family history of cancer. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified in enriched targeted genes. Post test genetic counseling and single site mutation testing was offered to high risk family members at our laboratory in Santiago, Chile. Results: Double heterozygosity was identified in the proband. In BRCA1 c.3331_3334delCAAG (rs80357903) also known as c.3450del4 recognized as pathogenic. This mutation is a common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Colombian ancestry. In BRCA2 c.4889C>G (rs80358711) also known as c.5117C>G is a truncating variant that creates a premature translational stop signal. Single site mutation testing was offered to 7 family members, 3 were BRCA2 carriers, 2 BRCA1 carriers and 2 family members obtained negative results for both mutations. Conclusion: Detection of double heterozygosity in germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 has implications for genetic counseling and clinical management of carriers identified.",2016
26474,"Genetic testing for families who are at an increased risk of developing bowel cancer due to a genetic predisposition can be time consuming, expensive and complex. Testing can be carried out by two methods: Directly sequen cing mismatch repair (MMR) genes or indirectly using immunohistochemi stry (IHC) and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing on tumour tissue. At the Liverpool WomenÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital (LWH), an individual must fit the modified Amsterdam Criteria to qualify for direct genetic testing. Alternatively, indivi duals that meet a less stringent criterion (Cairns et al guidelines) or depart mental criteria may be sent for IHC/MSI testing. Through a clinical audit of this strategy, it was established that IHC/MSI te sting had a very low pick up rate (4%) and a 6 12 month turnaround time. In addition, this testing was found to cost a minimum of ÃÂ£460 per sample plus ÃÂ£138 for methylation tests should an abnormal result be discovered. This gave a cost per positive of ÃÂ£7406 in 2014. In 2015, the LWH genetics department implemented a Multiplicom HNPCC related gene panel which reduced the cost of direct gene testing to approximately ÃÂ£500 per sample and reduced analysis time to 6 days. Given the number of patients tested in 2014, this test would have a cost per positive of ÃÂ£3500.As a result of the audit, new departmental guidelines have now been deve loped. Direct gene testing has now been expanded to individuals who fall within a new departmental criteria, IHC testing has been significantly re stricted and MSI testing has been removed from standard practice.",2016
26475,"Introduction: Often, genetic counselling for predictive testing may not focus on the possibility of incidental or unexpected findings due to the percep tion that the narrow focus of genetic testing for known mutations would make those types of findings highly unlikely. In this case, due to the nature of the test platform being used, it was found that while the consultand did not carry the maternal familial BRCA1 deletion, he did carry a pathogenic duplication. This incidental finding was a novel experience for both the ge netic counsellors and laboratory staff involved and required management of a number of complex issues. Methods: Laboratory staff liaised with the genetics unit to develop a report which accurately reflected how the finding had been detected. Counsellors involved considered a number of ethical issues in preparation for providing the result to the consultand and working with his family. These included planning how, or if, to raise the possibility of non paternity given the low de novo rate for BRCA mutations and the absence of a reported paternal family history of cancer. Outcome: Collaborative communication between the laboratory and genetic counselling staff and between genetic counsellors and family members was the key to effectively managing this incidental finding and the flow on ef fects within the family. Successful communication and support has resulted in a number of at risk relatives coming forward for predictive testing. This case also highlighted the importance of comprehensive pre and post test counselling particularly as the resolution and complexity of genetic testing platforms continues to increase.",2016

However there are no fixed predictive factors for testicular sperm extraction success has been established. De tection of mosaicism could be important for the clinical evaluation. In this study we have assessed the degree of mosaicism in peripheral blood and buccal mucosal cells. The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using centromere X,Y probe was applied on the peripheral blood and buccal cells as a sensitive technique for the detection of mosaicism.

ORG 398Back to index Materials and Methods: 20 Patients are classified into 12 Klinefelter syndro me patients (group I) and 8 Klinefelter syndrome like patients (group II) according to karyotype and clinical appearance. Karyotype for each patient was done and FISH analysis for cells from peripheral blood and buccal swap was recorded. Results: Out of the 12 klinefelter syndrome patients (group I), 5(41.6%) were found to have mosaic cell lines. The mosaic Klinefelter syndrome pa tients were 47,XXY/46,XY. Testicular volumes in patients of group II were larger when compared to those in group I. One patient in group II has no azoospermia. Conclusions: The mosaicism level in testicular tissue, not only concerning germ cells but also for somatic cells, could be of relevance to the final outco me of spermatogenesis in patients with Klinefelter syndrome.

In emergencies situations, the knowledge of this history is crucial to ensure quality of care. When call ing to Emergency Medical Call Center (EMCC), the patient has an interview with a medical dispatcher that adjusts the response given the gravity of the situation and the patientÃ¢ÂÂs history. Materials and Methods: In this study we sought to evaluate the frequency, cause, and the quality of care for patients with FBN1 gene mutation calling to EMCC. Between April 2008 and October 2015, we collected all calls of the 37 mutated patients known. We analyzed the number, recurrence and rea sons of call as well as the knowledge of the history of MFS by the dispatcher. Results: Among the 37 patients known as MFS carrier, 16 have called 25 times to EMCC during 7 years. More than half of calls (60%) had a potential link with the MFS (10 calls for chest pain, 5 for dyspnea 5). Trauma repre sents 5 calls. The notion of MFS was known in two calls (8%). DispatcherÃ¢ÂÂs decision was appropriate in 40% of cases. Conclusion: Half of patients with FBN1 mutation have used the EMCC mostly for reasons related to their condition. The notion of MFS was known only in 8% of calls that probably reduce quality and safety of healthcare. A reg istration of MFS patients on a special list for the EMCC should improve the quality of management.",2016

We analyzed CDKN2A and MC1R in patients from Latin America with familial and sporadic multiple primary melanoma (SMP) and compare the data with those for patients from Spain to establish bases for melanoma genetic counseling in Latin America. Material and Methods: CDKN2A and MC1R were sequenced in 186 patients from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay, and in 904 Spanish pati ents. Clinical and phenotypic data were obtained. Results: Overall, 24 and 14% of melanoma prone families in Latin America and Spain, respectively, had mutations in CDKN2A. Latin American families had CDKN2A mutations more frequently (P , 0.014) than Spanish ones. Of patients with SMP , 10% of those from Latin America and 8.5% of those from Spain had mutations in CDKN2A. Latin American patients had fairer hair and skin and a higher prevalence of MC1R variants compared with Spanish patients. Conclusion: The inclusion criteria for genetic counseling of melanoma in Latin America may be the same criteria used in Spain, as suggested in areas with low to medium incidence, SMP with at least two melanomas, or fami lies with at least two cases among first or second degree relatives.

26480,"Background: The technology for genomic studies has expanded tremend ously in the last decade. Although the price of molecular genetic tests has gradually decreased, the burden of costs is considerable even for highly de veloped European countries. Romania is a developing country where even though appropriate laboratory equipment now exists in some genetic cen tres, the cost for consumables needs to be well planned. We aimed to defi ne an approach for prioritizing the allocation of molecular genetics tests at national level. Methods: The norms for allocating resources need to account for clinical usefulness of a test(treatment/prevention strategies); and treating people equally. With limited resources, the degree of an individualÃ¢ÂÂs need for me dical intervention may be the most important criterion. Nonetheless, it is imperative to offer genetic tests non discriminatively to all people in need, regardless of their economical/social/ethnic status. Results: Romanian Society of Medical Genetics together with the Ministry of Health, Romanian National Alliance for Rare Diseases(RoNARD) and other stakeholders are developing a national strategy for allocating resources, based on epidemiological data on genetic conditions in Romania. In accor dance with needs, healthcare expertize and existing infrastructure, priori tization criteria are being developed to optimize patient access to genetic tests. Coordination between regional centres of medical genetics is crucial for improved efficiency. Conclusion: Further work is needed to determine the criteria necessary in decision making, in order to respect equality but also clinical need within a limited budget.

Simultaneously we have also run a MOOC Ã¢ÂÂCancer in the 21st Century: The Genomic RevolutionÃ¢ÂÂ and as educators and course de signers we were frustrated by the seeming redundancy facing an excellent example of course design and implementation. Methods: Earlier this year we re purposed the MOOC, using a blended lear ning approach, in order to offer a Cancer Genomics SSC to a wider group of students than previously possible. To evaluate its success we used a combi nation of a questionnaires and thematic analysis of student reflective diaries as well as staff evaluations. Results: Analysis of the questionnaires and reflective diaries highlighted a number of key themes. The overall level of enjoyment of the SSC was high but a number of issues deserve further investigation. In particular we will discuss knowledge versus skill acquisition, pacing of the content, interac tion with fellow students and educators and the concept of learning along side Ã¢ÂÂnon expertsÃ¢ÂÂ.Discussion: Genomics is a key area for the next generation of medical stu dents to have a secure understanding of, but the ever crammed undergradu ate curriculum as well as the reliance on Ã¢ÂÂin houseÃ¢ÂÂ expertise may limit the exposure to this exponentially expanding area.

26482,"Among the yearly 4 million newborns in the US, 15% are premature accoun ting for 75% of NICU admissions while the remaining 25% term babies ad mitted have varying pathology including developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). Establishing underlying genetic etiology early helps with diagnosis, prognosis and comorbidity information. According to American Academy of Pediatrics chromosome analysis (CA) is required for evaluation of children with DD/ID. Yet CA and FISH are sub optimal in identifying the etiology of DD/ID. American Academy of Neurology, Child Neurology Socie ty, and American College of Medical Genetics recommend that chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) be the first line genetic test. However, the ave rage turnaround time for CMA is 21 days and the daily NICU cost exceeds $3,500 per infant. With test utilization and costs significantly impacting healthcare institutions, we developed a novel approach to perform CA with reflex testing to CMA on pediatric blood samples. A CA preliminary result is reported within 24 hours. If positive for trisomy, final result is reported within 48 72 hours. If negative, CMA is reflexed based on practice guideli nes. Clients are only charged either CA or CMA. Since inception in January 2015, clients requested reflex testing on 43 patients, of which 6 resulted in a positive prelim requiring no further testing. With our approach, we esti mate a cost savings of ~$63,000 per infant by reducing the NICU stay by ~16 18 days. Reflex testing to CMA after a 24 hour CA preliminary study shows potential for extensive cost savings while maintaining optimal care for NICU patients.",2016

We describe the first 2 years of our experience with implementing NIPT in a clinical, private practice setting, specifically focusing on the genetic coun selling considerations. Materials and Methods: A record review was per formed for data pertaining to women who received genetic counselling for NIPT during the period July 2013 June 2015 for common autosomal and/or sex chromosome aneuploidies and/or gender. Data was collected on rate of uptake of NIPT , indications and motivations for testing, characteristics of patients and test results. Results: During this period, 385 women received genetic counselling about NIPT and 354 (91%) accepted the test. Of wo ABSTRACTS POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG.

Eight (2.3%) NIPT screen positive results were obtained: seven for Trisomy 21 and one for Trisomy 18, seven ended in termination of preg nancy. Conclusions: In South Africa, NIPT is a relatively expensive screening test, currently only available in the private sector to a select group who can afford it. Whilst most women requested NIPT for a high risk of Down syn drome, other reasons included additional reassurance or general concerns about Down syndrome/disability.

26485,"Background: Since the introduction of non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in 2011, mainly by commercial companies, a growing demand for NIPT from the public and healthcare professionals has put pressure on healthcare systems of various countries. This study identifies the challenges of esta blishing a responsible implementation of NIPT for aneuploidy in prenatal healthcare, by looking at the Netherlands. Materials and methods: We used a mixed methods approach involving 13 stakeholder interviews (laboratory specialists, gynecologists, clinical ge neticists, midwives, patient organization representatives, health insurance advisor and prenatal screening experts), document analysis and (participa tory) observations of the Dutch NIPT consortium meetings. The Diffusion of Innovation Theory and a Network of Actors model were used to interpret the findings. Results: Implementation of NIPT was facilitated by several factors. The set up of a national NIPT Consortium enabled discussion and collaboration between stakeholders. Moreover, it led to the plan to offer NIPT through a nationwide research setting (TRIDENT study; Trial by Dutch laboratories for Evaluation of Non Invasive Prenatal Testing), which created a learning phase for careful implementation. The Dutch legal context was perceived as a delaying factor, but eventually gave room for the stakeholders involved to organise themselves and their practices. Conclusions: This study shows that implementing advanced technologies with profound effects on prenatal care benefit from a learning phase that allows time to carefully evaluate the technical performance and womenÃ¢ÂÂs experiences and to enable public debate. Such a coordinated learning phase, involving all stakeholders, will stimulate the process of responsible and su stainable implementation.",2016
26486,"At least 10% of patients seen in primary care have a condition with a genetic component. Previous studies indicate that primary care practitioners lack practical knowledge of genetics and genetic testing and lack confidence in providing services related to genetic conditions. There is therefore strong potential for professionals to fail to recognise patients who are at risk of genetic disease, resulting in inadequately management or referral to spe cialist services. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate genetics educational interventions in the context of primary care. We used the process for systematic reviews developed by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and conducted a search of five relevant elec tronic databases. Primary research papers were eligible for inclusion if they included data on outcomes of educational interventions for primary care professionals focussed on genetics. The results from each paper were coded and presented in narrative form. Eleven studies were included in the review. The five major themes identified were: prior experience, changes in confidence, changes in knowledge, chan ges in practice, satisfaction and feedback. In five studies, knowledge of prac titioners improved following the educational programmes, while practitio ner confidence improved in six studies. There was little apparent change to practice, where this was investigated. The objective of educational programmes is to enhance patient care, but more effort is needed to measure resulting changes in practice. We also sug gest that, in addition to educational programmes, provision of resources to supply Ã¢ÂÂjust in timeÃ¢ÂÂ information and accessible clinical tools may contribute to improving care.",2016

Aim: In this study we aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of inversion by presenting three case studies: 2 children diagnosed with dysmorphic fea tures and congenital anomalies and one couple with infertility. So, first case (5 days/F) has: facial dysmorphism, macrocephaly, cleft lip palate, low set ears, limb shortening, right pulmonary hypoplasie; second case (2 days/F) present: short stature, dysmorphic features, hypertelorism, low set ears, short neck, mild hypotonia; and the third case is a couple (F , 37 yrs / M , 39 yrs) with two pregnancies stopped (in the first trimester) and without a family history of reproductive disorders. Materials and Methods: In this respect, we made karyotyping analysis using GTG banding for each proband and also for their parents. Results: Parental origin of inv(9)(p12q13) was detected in maternal (in the second case) in one children and in the other two cases was de novo origin (first case and the female).Conclusion: Our investigation revealed that all three cases with inv(9)(p12q13) had various clinical features and we appreciate that inv(9) may have a role in the abnormal phenotype development.

Most literature focused on public involvement in ge neral, and the literature discussing NBS illustrated that the involvement is often through patient representatives, takes place ad hoc, and focuses on informing rather than deliberating. Public involvement does not take place in a structured or transparent man ner in current NBS policy making. It is relevant to shape such involvement and develop a model to include relevant views from the public, and also de bate whether expanding NBS is the right mechanism to implement possibi lities from NGS.",2016

Orphanet, the reference database for rare diseases and orphan drugs, offers a range of fre ely accessible services, including a directory of medical laboratories and dia gnostic tests. In order to respond to the evolution of genetic testing techni ques and to provide useful information for the identification of laboratories across Europe in the framework of the European Cross Border Healthcare Directive, Orphanet has further developed its medical laboratories and clini cal tests database. New information has been associated with the tests, with each test assigned at least one purpose (e.g. prenatal, postnatal, preimplan tation), one specialty (e.g. molecular genetics, cytogenetics.), one objective (e.g. targeted mutation analysis, sequence analysis of the entire coding regi on, methylation analysis.), and one technique (e.g. Sanger sequencing, NGS sequencing, MLPA based techniques). This new model allows for a more precise and user friendly search for a test or laboratory via the Orphanet website. One significant improvement is that results can be filtered using this newly registered data, as well as by the country of the laboratory and/or data concerning the quality management (accreditation and participation to EQAs).

There has been a steady increase in referrals, clinical queries from secondary care and a demand to increase patient accessibility in our peri pheral locations. This prompted us to revisit our current service delivery model. In order to service this need, a model of weekly telephone clinics was initiated as part of a pilot project at GuyÃ¢ÂÂs Hospital. Prior to this pilot, all cancer referrals were offered face to face clinic appointments. A total of 125 telephone clinic appointments were conducted with patients referred to our cancer service over a six month period. Aims: The aims of the telephone clinics were:Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Manage service demandÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Increase capacity for appointments within same resourcesÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Increase patient accessibility in wide geographical areasÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Reassure families not at increased familial cancer riskÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Collect and clarify further information required to complete the cancer risk assessmentÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Provide fast access to information and advice for those not requiring face to face appointments Methods: Feedback questionnaires were sent to the Cancer Genetics clini cians and patients that participated in each telephone appointment.

In October 2013, the European Parliament suggested in its proposal for Regulation of in vitro diagnostic medical devices that DTC advertising of GT with both direct and indirect medical purpose should be banned. While the proposed Regulation is currently under discussion among the European institutions, this work aims to evaluate the proportionality of forbidding DTC advertising for a broad range of GT . To this end, an overview is provided of the various ways genetic tests have been advertised over the past years and the different ethical issues that have arisen from advertisements. Subse quently, this work examines the laws currently regulating the advertising of GT both at the EU and at the Member States level. Finally, the proportionality of the ban is discussed, drawing a parallel with the discussion regarding the ban on DTC advertising of prescription drugs in Europe. As a conclusion, it is argued that it might be more proportionate to only implement a ban on DTC advertising of GT that may have a direct impact on consumersÃ¢ÂÂ health, and impose rigorous rules on DTC advertising for the rest of health related genetic tests. Such regulation should ensure that promotional claims are substantiated and the benefits, risks and limitations, as well as the target audience of GT are clearly presented.",2016

The medical society is believed to have changed its outlook towards amniocentesis since that time, placing greater importance on Ã¢ÂÂparental autonomy.Ã¢ÂÂ However, this view has not been veri fied from a bioethical perspective. We aimed to determine the origin of Japa nese Ã¢ÂÂautonomyÃ¢ÂÂ with respect to amniocentesis by analyzing obstetriciansÃ¢ÂÂ discourses.[Methods] The authors surveyed three representative journals of obstetrics and selected articles that mention ethical issues pertaining to amniocente sis. Thirty two articles were selected and categorized based on their ethical references. Next, we discussed the implications of the noninvasive prena tal testing (NIPT) guidelines drawn by the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG).[Results] Since 1975, reports criticizing selective abortions owing to amnio centesis increased, corresponding with the social attack on the implemen tation of the prenatal test.

26499,"The idea of differential treatment based on personal genetic information has caused a great deal of concern in society and the threat of Ã¢ÂÂgenetic discrimi nationÃ¢ÂÂ has lead to the development of regulations to protect against this in many countries. However, despite these regulatory efforts, people still seem to hold concerns about becoming victims of genetic discrimination. This stu dy aimed to explore whether concerns relating to genetic discrimination are present in Flanders, the origins of these fears, and which coping strategies people employ. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 30 carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, recruited through a Flemish BRCA self help group. Many participants did not express concerns about genetic discrimination, believing that being at risk for breast and ovarian cancer would not be considered as a valid basis for discrimination. These participants had never experienced it personally, nor seen it happening to others. However, other participants did hold concerns about either direct or indirect genetic discri mination. They mentioned a range of different contexts in which they felt discrimination could occur, such as insurance and employment, where their concerns originated from seeing others experience discrimination, although genetic information was not the basis for this. They also discussed discrimi nation in relationships, holding concerns that new partners would not cope with a future overshadowed by the risk of having cancer. These findings show that despite BelgiumÃ¢ÂÂs legislative effort to prohibit the use of genetic information, some BRCA mutation carriers are still concerned to become the victim of discrimination.

26500,"Introduction: Women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Managing this risk requires a multidisci plinary approach. However, the literature suggests that healthcare profes sionals do not always have similar views of genetic risk and its management. This paper explores the messages that physicians convey, consciously or un consciously, to unaffected genetically at risk women and the consequences of these messages, based on the experience of the women themselves. Material and methods: Using a grounded theory design, retrospective biographical interviews were conducted with 32 unaffected women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, who had presymptomatic testing at least three years previously. Data were analyzed with the constant comparative method using ATLAS.ti software. Results: Physicians convey three different messages during the consultation: a normative message (at risk women are required to take responsibility for their health and to adopt risk management behaviour); a self confronting message (at risk women are invited to question what is essential to them and to act accordingly); a minimizing message (at risk women are consi dered as Ã¢ÂÂsecond class patientsÃ¢ÂÂ compared to patients who have presented cancer). Being simultaneously exposed to these conflicting messages, gene tically at risk women experience a strong sense of disorientation and find it difficult to know how to act regarding their risk. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to make physicians aware of the mes sages they convey to unaffected genetically at risk women and to promote a shared representation of this condition among healthcare professionals.

Data Access Committees (DACs) are established as a governance mechanism to assess data access requests for the purpose of approval or disapproval. This paper explores the perspectives of DAC mem bers and experts on components of access review and functionality of DACs in handling data access requests in accord with the genomic data sharing goals. Methods: Semi structured interviews were conducted with 16 DAC mem bers and 4 experts in the field, from a diverse international and professional background. Data was analyzed using content analysis methodologies. Results: The interviewees indicated the access review mainly comprises of assessing the ethical footings and the scientific merits of the proposed uses. However, they were ambivalent about the scope and rigor of such review by DACs and the adequacy of available tools and mechanisms to achieve the goals of review. In addition, qualification of the users was subject to scrutiny of DACs. Given the fragmented or poorly delineated qualification criteria at times, the interviewees underscored the significance of adopting standard ways in order to streamline the procedure. Discussion and Conclusion: DACs would benefit from international and institutional policies and guidelines delineating various aspects of access review, including the userÃ¢ÂÂs qualification criteria and the sanctions against the violations of policies. Furthermore, the current components of access review should be revisited to reassure the complexity of the access review corresponds to the concerns associated with data sharing and facilitates re sponsible data use.",2016

In cancer genomic research, not only family history information, but also germline sequence data, including genomic data from patientsÃ¢ÂÂ relatives, is essential. Sharing these relativesÃ¢ÂÂ data requires careful ethical consideration, because future studies may re veal that they present with known or unknown pathogenic variants. Moreo ver, when the total number of families is small in a given study, the risk of re identifying family members increases. However, to date, there is no regu lation especially for sharing relativesÃ¢ÂÂ data.

26503,"Introduction: Diagnostic exome sequencing (DES) involves the simultane ous analysis of virtually all exonic and flanking intronic sequences. Con sequently, DES may result in the identification of secondary findings (SF), which are incidental deleterious variants unrelated to the testing indication. In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) issued recommendations pertaining to the reporting of disease causing mutations within 56 genes identified incidentally during exome or genome analysis. Methods: We examined the evolution of SF test offerings within a single clin ical laboratory in the United States from 2011 to 2015. We also performed a retrospective analysis of the patient preferences and positive rates of SF from the ACMG recommended 56 and/or expanded gene lists among the first 1500 patients who underwent DES through our clinical laboratory. Results: Of 1500 DES cases, 437 (29.1%) were ordered before ACMG pub lished recommendations, and 1063 (70.9%) were issued after. Overall, 1361 of 1500 (90.7%) patients requested at least some SF results, and 451 (30.1%) of these cases requested results from more than the ACMG recom mended gene list. The majority of cases (1214/1361; 89.2%) had no report ed SF, and 47 (3.45%) of patients had at least one reported SF from among the ACMG recommended list of 56 genes. Conclusions: Based on our experience, most patients proceeding with DES elected to receive at least some SF results. Almost 90% of these cases were negative. A continued evolution in the reporting of SF is anticipated as DES becomes increasingly utilized, and as disease gene relationships are better elucidated.",2016

However, genetic information has Ethical, Legal and Social Issues (ELSI) because of its parti cularity. Some of those issues occur or become more complicated when the subjects are minors or fetuses who have no or insufficient competency for giving consent. In this presentation I would like to discuss the current state of these ELSI in Japan and consider some solutions. Methods: Investigation and analysis of various research papers, guidelines, and legal regulations at home and abroadResults: While ethical guidelines formulated by related academic societies have no legally enforceable powers, these guidelines have a certain degree of binding effect on their members in the research and clinical fields. However, the industry sector of DTC genetic testing services relies on self regulation, which is largely ineffective. As a result, there is a great deal of variation in the quality of companiesÃ¢ÂÂ tests, as well as the ethical standards under which these companies operate. Conclusions: In cases where minors or fetuses are subjects, especially in DNA paternity tests without consent from minors or their mothers and pre natal DNA paternity tests, these tests can seriously harm minors and fetu sesÃ¢ÂÂsometimes even causing abortion in the case of fetuses. RegulationsÃ¢ÂÂincluding legal onesÃ¢ÂÂshould be made in accordance with the type of genetic testing being conducted. This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15K08550.",2016

The second stage comprised clinical qualitative research whereby patients took part in a semi structured interview; these data were analyzed using the categorical thematic analysis technique. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the question naire domains between the NF1 patients and the control subjects. Eighteen main themes were extracted from the interviews, showing interference of the NF1 visibility principally in psychological aspects and social relation ships. Patients mentioned curiosity about NF1 and confusion about the di stinctions between NF1 and contagious diseases, which lead to prejudice.

26511,"Patents confer the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling a claimed invention, for a period of 20 years from its filing date. The paradox raised by patents is that they ensure a monopoly to the patent holder on his invention while it might be considered as a brake on innovation because when a patent owner exploits his patent, no one else can use the techno logy without asking for a license. Then, if a researcher wants to use several patented technologies for his own project, he will need to negotiate with all patent holders which is considered as time consuming and expensive. A wi der dissemination of inventions can be offered while preserving the patent ownersÃ¢ÂÂ rights, through a collaborative process known as Ã¢ÂÂpatent poolÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂclearing housesÃ¢ÂÂ mechanisms.

26513,"Recently, leading programs such as the Precision Medicine Initiative in the US and Genomics England in the UK have promoted the implementation of genome medicine. These national level initiatives aim to demonstrate the complex relationship between genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors regarding the development of disease, foreseeing individualized diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease. In Japan, a new policy movement to implement genome medicine has re cently started. In 2012, Japan established the Headquarters of Healthcare Policy (HHP) to promote healthcare innovation. The committee charge of Ã¢ÂÂgenome medicineÃ¢ÂÂ, positioned under the HHP , has released a new policy for the achievement of genome medicine, and showed the approach of research development as well as of improving the environment for genome medicine. In addition to these movements, the Act on the Protection of Personal Infor mation was revised in 2015, so that the ethical and legal regulation regar ding genome information are currently being reviewed. In this study, we have examined the current policy movements, including ethical considerations, related to genome medicine in Japan. We have clari fied the drafting process and major points of the new policy, and suggested some of the main challenges and opportunities in its implementation. One of the main findings is that the latest policy has significantly emphasized role sharing arrangements and organic co operation primarily between ca binet secretariat, ministries and funding agencies. This study represents a valuable opportunity to share an experience regarding policy developments in Japan with other countries and to explore and develop new methods of policy making.",2016
26514,"Purpose: The return of secondary findings (SF) in whole genome and exo me sequencing (WGS/WES) is a subject of much debate. As WGS/WES mo ves into routine clinical practice, it is timely to review data that might in form this debate in the development of policies that maximize benefit for participants. Methods: We systematically searched 6 electronic databases for qualitati ve and quantitative studies that explored stakeholder views on SF in WGS/WES, in clinical and research settings. Framework analysis was undertaken to identify major themes, and assess the extent to which there was sufficient evidence base for informing policy on SF in WGS/WES. Results: Thirty two articles reporting views of over 11,000 stakeholders were found to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of returning life threatening and treatable SF, but varied in views on other types of SF. Largely, views of sequencing providers focused on the idea of Ã¢ÂÂresponsibilityÃ¢ÂÂ and non providers focused on Ã¢ÂÂrights.Ã¢ÂÂConclusions: Stakeholders agreed on importance of patient autonomy and generally supported a model of shared responsibility in SF management. Professionals, therefore, need to balance their responsibility to care for par ticipants with sharing decision making. To do so, professionals need to help participants exercise their rights in an informed manner. This has implicati ons for pre test discussions and informed consent, as technical knowledge was not found to lead to more informed decision making. Further research into what best informs decisions around SF is, therefore, essential. As 70% of the included studies were American, it is crucial that research gathering European and other international perspectives be conducted.",2016

Genetic information is often considered as Ã¢ÂÂexceptionalÃ¢ÂÂ health information because of its personal, predictive and familial dimension. Indeed, the dia gnosis of a serious genetic anomaly in a patient can be clinically relevant for other family members when preventive measures or treatment exists. However, the transmission of such confidential medical information to at risk relatives questions some fundamental principles of health law, such as medical secrecy, the right to privacy, the right to health information, or the right not to know. In France, the legislator introduced a specific system for disclosing genetic information to family members in 2004, revised in 2011 by the last Bioethics law. The patient has now a legal duty to inform his relatives about genetic risks when it is relevant for their health. This information can be delivered directly by the patient, or indirectly through a specific procedure involving the prescribing medical doctor. Although the French legislator tried to con ciliate the various rights raised, the patient and the prescribing doctor are in charge of many procedural obligations, which have significant implications in terms of liability. Indeed, if the patient does not inform his relatives, he could be held liable under civil law. A comparative study of eight countries (Italy, Portugal, Belgium, USA, UK, Spain, Switzerland and France) on the disclosure of genetic information to family members will be carried out, with a focus on the liability regimes applicable to patients and health professionals, and on their judicial con sequences.",2016
26516,"Background: Clinical trials are essential activities for scientific and medi cal progress that involve interventions on human beings which voluntarily participate to biomedical research projects for testing new drugs, medical devices or methods. Biomedical research protocols intrinsically involve some risks for the participants which have to be outweighed by the health/ scientific benefits and controlled by researchers and public authorities. Par ticipants are entitled to know about these risks before consenting to the trial and their interests should always prevail on scientific interest. EU law and bioethical guidelines promote transparency and data sharing principles as obligations for research sponsor/promoters and investigators. Allowing independent assessment and public oversight of the activities, transparency mechanisms are supporting fairness, safety, precaution, social responsibility and research integrity in innovation. Transparency should find concrete applications through projectsÃ¢ÂÂ designs and be particularly re spected where security problems arise and engage the health of the partici pants. This poster summarises the key points of transparency implementa tion, as required by law and good clinical practices and illustrate the needs for transparency in the rare context of risk realization. Discussion: In the light of the inquiry on the drama that occurred in January 2016 with the phase 1 BIOTRIAL clinical trial (EudraCT nÃÂ° 2015 001799 24) conducted in France that caused the death of an healthy participant and emergency hospitalization of 5 other volunteers, this poster tends to inform and question crisis management from an ethical point of view while the EU Clinical Trial Regulation of 2014 is going to be enforced in the coming years.",2016
26517,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditi ons that have a complex genetic etiology. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful ASD research tool since it can assay many types of genetic va riation in a single test. In recent years, there has been a lot of debate around return of results following genetic testing; however, there is a paucity of em pirical data on research subjectÃ¢ÂÂs experience with WGS, in particular. To eli cit and analyze participantsÃ¢ÂÂ experiences with WGS, we invited parents (and capable children) who were enrolled in an ASD genomic study to participate in semi structured interviews at two times during the WGS testing cycle: 1) following informed consent, and 2) following return of results. To date, we have interviewed 19 parents at time 1 and 8 parents at time 2. Emerging themes from time 1 interviews include, hope for a genetic diagnosis, hope for treatment, and altruism. Parents also hoped for findings that they could use for planning and prevention purposes, although they expressed con cerns over inflicted insight and insurance discrimination. Following return of results at time 2, emerging themes include, the value of learning genetic information, the resolution of blame between biological parents, and dis appointment at not receiving treatment guiding information. Our findings suggest that participants may have different motivations/concerns before and after testing; whereas many begin with altruistic motivations, their desire for actionable results weighs heavily post testing. Though our ana lysis is provisional, these results suggest that novel strategies for education and informed consent are necessary.

26518,"Background: About half of spontaneous abortions are caused by chromo somal abnormalities. Furthermore, diagnosis of chromosomal abnormali ties during first and second trimesters of pregnancy can lead to detection of many infirmities and treated abortion. Method: We analyzed 100 pregnant women with evidence of chromosomal aberrations. Among them 83% had positive in screening serum test, 3% with abnormal sonographical soft markers, and 6% with both of serum screening and sonographical soft marker, 7% with past history of chromo somal abnormal child, 1% with maternal chromosomal abnormality. Amniocytes were cultured and then the fetus karyotypes were cytogeneti cally analyzed. Results: Normal karyotyping was in 80% of fetuses (39% male and 41% female). Minimal change and major chromosomal aberrations were seen in 20% of fetuses , consisting of: 9qh+ (6), 22ps+(1), 21ps+ (1), translo cation(5,9)(1 case), inversion 9 (2) , Down syndrome (47,XX+21)(1 case), Down syndrome with Robertsonian translocation (1), mosaic Turner syn drome(1).

Endocrinological and anatomical causes, infectious diseases, environ mental factors, immunological defects, genetic factors including numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations are the main causes for early mis carriages. The most common karyotypic anomaly in early miscarriages is autosomal trisomy. Chromosomal aberrations play an important role in the etiology of early miscarriages. Materials and Methods: 37 years old pregnant female patient who has a healthy daughter was admitted to Polyclinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Faculty of Medicine in Mersin University for the missed abortion. Abortion materials from two separate pregnancies were sent to laboratory at diffe rent times. Samples from the first fetus from the 8th week of the pregnancy and the samples from the second fetus from the 9th week of pregnancy were cultured and metaphase plates are obtained using GTG banding technique. 15 metaphase plates from the first fetus and 20 from the second fetus were cytogenetically examined.

Introduction: Structural chromosomal abnormalities, balanced or unbalan ced, may be inherited from a carrier parent or may occur as de novo re arrangements. When the abnormality occurs as a de novo event, the risk for genetic disease is increased, even when the rearrangement appears ba lanced. This may result from either submicroscopic deletions or duplicati ons at the breakpoints. Like any other chromosome, Y chromosome can be translocated onto an autosome, in a balanced or unbalanced way, with a low incidence. Materials and methods: We report two prenatal cases with a de novo Y;autosome translocation resulting in submicroscopic deletions. The cases were analysed by conventional karyotype using standard chromosome pre paration technique. The investigation continued with targeted array CGH technique, using BAC clones for the identification of potential submicrosco pic imbalances. All results were confirmed by FISH analysis using specific probes. Results: Conventional karyotype revealed abnormal karyotypes for both cases with 45 chromosomes and a translocation of the entire Y, (or at least the entire long arm) to an acrocentric autosome, chromosome 13 and chro mosome 15 respectively. Array CGH detected genomic imbalances, more precisely, a deletion of 305.6Kb on Yp of the SRY gene for the first case and a deletion of 6.5Mb on chromosome 15q of the Prader Willi/Angelman region for the second case. Both array CGH results were confirmed by FISH. Conclusions: Array CGH method increases the detection of chromosomal abnormalities for high risk pregnancies and allows for more accurate gene tic counseling, recurrent risk assessment and for more informed reproduc tive decision making.

Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples obtained from 108 azoospermia samples and 100 healthy controls. Probab le mutations in exons 9 and 10 of TDRD5 gene were screened using multi temperature single strand conformation polymorphism (MSSCP) technique. Genotyping was performed using Tetra ARMS PCR for rs508485(T>C) and rs11703684(C>T) polymorphisms. Results: Significant difference in distribution of rs508485 geÃÂ¬notypes was found in azoospermia cases in comparison to controls, with P value of 0.035 and odds ratio equal to 2.00 (95% CI: 1.04 3.86). No mutation was detected in Tudor domain of the TDRD5 gene in the patients. Conclusion: We provide, for the first time, evidence for association between genetic variation the genes involved in the piRNA pathway and azoospermia in Iranian patients.

26526,"Introduction: Spontaneous abortion is one of the most frequent problem of pregnancy. More than 50% of all spontaneous abortions have abnormal karyotype. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) can detect chromosomal abnor malities associated with spontaneous abortions while avoiding the technical problems associated with tissue culture. Materials and Methods: A total of 76 spontaneous abortions of the first tri mesters (4 12 weeks of gestation) were studied by CGH. The additional an euploidies detected by CGH were all confirmed by targeting FISH with cor responding DNA probes. All samples shown to be chromosomally balanced in CGH underwent interphase FISH to determine ploidy with DNA probes for chromosomes 18, X and Y. Results: The overall rate of detected numerical chromosomal abnormalities was 57%. Trisomies of autosomes were the predominant chromosomal ab errations (58 %) followed by triploidy (23%) and monosomy X (12%). An unbalanced structural rearrangement was found in one (2,3%) case. In two cases complex aneuploidies were identified: monosomy X simultaneously with trisomy 22, monosomy X with partial trisomy 6q. Most frequently in volved in trisomies were chromosomes 16 and 22 (16% each), 4, 5, 15 and 21 (4, 7 % each). Trisomies of 2,10, and 13 chromosomes was found in one (2,3 %) cases each.

26528,"O. Ott, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation, 2St. Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation. Sperm DNA quality plays a major role in male fertility. But the parameters of the conventional semen analysis do not reliably predict it. The integrity of the sperm DNA is essential for the accurate transmission of genetic informa tion. Large sperm nuclear vacuoles are thought to be related to sperm DNA damage such as DNA fragmentation. The purpose of this study was to know if the sperm morphology reflects its DNA fragmentation which thought to be associated with reduced embryo quality, implantation and live birth rates. In the present study we evaluated the sperm DNA fragmentation measured by the deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL) in 10 male patients with subfertility. For each patient two types of motile spermatozoa were selected under the high magnification by the same trained operator as follows: with large nuclear vacuoles and normal. We in cluded patients with various sperm characteristics (various proportions of Ã¢ÂÂnormalÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂvacuolatedÃ¢ÂÂ spermatozoa in ejaculate, various motility profiles and various sperm concentration).A total of 429 Ã¢ÂÂvacuolatedÃ¢ÂÂ and 197 Ã¢ÂÂnormalÃ¢ÂÂ spermatozoa were analysed. The threshold for statistical significance was set to PÃ¢ÂÂ¤0,05. Among sperm with large nuclear vacuoles DNA fragmentation rate was extremely higher compare to the control: 12,6% vs. 1,5% (p<0,001).The DNA fragmentation rate appeared to be correlated with the presence of large sperm head vacuoles.

26529,"BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common trisomy in live born with a prevalence of 1 in 1000 to 1 in 1100.Well studied etiologies were maternal age and genetic polymorphism of folate metabolic pathway. Folate metabolism is governed by multiple enzymes. One of them methy lenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) converts 5,10 methylenetetra hydrofolate to 5 methylenetetrahydrofolate. Polymorphisms in gene enco ding the folate metabolizing methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR C677T and A1298C) have been linked to the etiology of Down syndrome. We examined the prevalence of these variant genotypes in mothers who had given birth to a child with Down syndrome and in control mothers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two common variants C677T and A1298C of the MTHFR gene were screened in mothers with DS children (n , 67 for C677T polymorphism; n,65 for A1298C polymorphism) and control mothers without DS children (n , 53 for C677T polymorphism; n,51 for A1298C polymorphism) from ÃÂukurova region of Turkey. The MTHFR geno types were studied by RFLP analysis of PCR amplified products. RESULTS: AA and AC genotypes for A1298C polymorphism are not asso ciated with the risk of DS pregnancy while C677T polymorphism is signi ficantly associated with the risk of DS pregnancy. The CC genotype was at higher rate at cases than controls for A1298C polymorphism ( p<0.05). The CC genotype was higher in the controls than cases for C677T polymorphism ( p<0.05).CONCLUSÃÂ°ON: Our study suggests that C677T polymorphism is significantly associated with the risk of DS pregnancy.

In the present work, we study blood karyotype and FISH on spermatozoa of infertile men, to evalu ate the relation between heterochromatic variants and meiotic alterations. Blood karyotype and sperm aneuploidy (disomy and diploidy) rates for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y were evaluated in 251 infertile men with karyotype without structural rearrangement.

The analysis included FV (G1691A), FII (G20210A), PAI I (675 5G/4G), MTHFR (C677T , A1298C), MTRR (A66G), MTR1 (A2756G), FGB (C148T , G 455A), ESR1 (A 351G, T 397C) genes poly morphism and fibrinogen level investigations. MDR 2.0 and SPSS 17.0 pro grams were used for statistical analysis. Results: 45 women had successful treatment of infertility during ART pro cedures (Group 1). No embryo implantation was in 52 women (Group 2). Fibrinogen levels were measured in women of both groups during 5 7 days after embryos transfer. The average level of fibrinogen in comparison groups did not differ. We have found two predictive model of ineffective ART procedure: MTHFR (677CT)/PAI I (675 5G/4G)/FGB (C148T) and FGB /PAI I(675 5G/4G)/fibrinogen level. Cut off for unfavorable mean fibrinogen level was 3,9 g/l. Patients in Group 2 had significantly higher prevalence of 148 CT and 148 TT genotypes in FGB gene and fibrinogen levels more than defined cut off.

Further investiga tions of gene gene and gene factors interactions are necessary to find group risk of unfavorable ART outcome. E",2016
26532,"INTRODUCTION: The finding of a genomic imbalance provides an initial ge netic diagnosis for a patient/fetus. The extension and composition of dele ted/duplicated region determines his possible pathogenicity. The risk of as sociated abnormalities is higher when the alteration is de novo, an issue es pecially important in prenatal diagnosis. When the chromosomal imbalance has been originated by a parental balanced rearrangement, the recurrence risk for next pregnancies is significantly increased, particularly in complex alterations, insertions and some type of inversions. METHODS: After reviewing our series of cytogenetic parental studies follo wing chromosome imbalance detection, we report, among all the ascertai ned abnormalities, those particular cases demonstrating the importance of additional chromosome and FISH analyses in patients and parents to cha racterize and locate the unbalanced rearrangement. RESULTS: In the following cases, additional investigations using conventio nal cytogenetic and FISH analysis resulted in a more accurate genetic dia gnosis for affected individuals and risk assessment for future gestations, substantially increasing the quality of genetic counselling: ins(18;2)mat t(8;13;12) double t(14;15)(14Ã¢ÂÂ;21) rec inv(4)pat rec inv(14)mat rare segregation 3:1 for t(3;5)pat del(Xp)mat t(Y;autosome). CONCLUSIONS: The finding of a genomic imbalance in a patient/fetus should be followed by additional studies to precise and locate the chromosomal re arrangement, in special when deletion or duplication has been identified using a quantitative analysis as array CGH, qPCR or MLPA. Also, parental study is always required to investigate the aberration origin, very important not only for genetic prognosis but also for reproductive counselling.

26533," Introduction: Recurrent spontaneous abortion is a multifactorial disease. At least 50 percent of abortions have no specific reason and are considered idiopathic. The renin angiotensin system plays a considerable role in grow th and differentiation in very early human development and in organogene sis. We sought to investigate whether exists any relationship between AGT M235T and AGTR1 A1166C with recurrent spontaneous abortion in Iranian patients. Methods: the Frequency of AGT M235T and AGTR1 A1166C polymorphisms in 110 idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortion women were compared to 105 females with no abortion history, employing tetra primer ARMS PCR. The validity of mentioned experiments were evaluated through sequencing procedure. The amino acid change was analyzed with tools like Ã¢ÂÂUCL CSÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂEXPASYÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂSIFTÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂPolyphen2Ã¢ÂÂ.Results: The frequency of A1166C in patients was AA (% 70), AC (% 28) and CC (% 1/8). The A1166C frequency of controls was AA (% 84/7), AC (% 15/2) and CC (% 0) (P,0.008) and the frequency of M235T in patients was TT (% 38.18), TC (% 61.8) and CC (% 0). The M235T frequency of control cases was TT (% 83.8), TC (% 16.2) and CC (% 0) (P,0.001).Conclusion: Our results show significant relationship between the AGT M235T and the AGTR1 A1166C polymorphisms with idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortion in Iranian women. So these polymorphisms can serve as appropriate options for investigation of other populations and it may contribute to the understanding the one of the genetic etiology of idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortion.

Introduction: Inherited thrombophilia, caused by the gene mutations of Fac tor V Leiden (FVL), Prothrombin (PTH G20210A) and Methylenetetrahydro folate reductase (MTHFR C677T), is often associated not only with throm boembolism, but also with pregnancy complications, but we donÃ¢ÂÂt have de tailed information about correlations between double and triple hetero and homozygous forms of FVL/PTH/MTHFR mutations and pregnancy compli cations (Spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, premature placental abruption, fetal development delay, preeclampsia, thromboembolism). Purpose of the study was to detect presence of different combinations of above mentioned mutations as a high risk factor for pregnancy complications. Materials and Methods: 350 Patients with pregnancy complications and 100 healthy individuals (aged 20 45 years), were genotyped by PCR analyses. Results: Different combinations of double and triple hetero and homozygous forms of FVL/PTH/MTHFR mutations (50 cases) were found in patients (27 (7,71%) cases of FVL/MTHFR heterozygous, 9 (2,57) PTH/MTHFR hete rozygous, 6 (1,71%) FVL hetero/MTHFR homozygous, 3 (0,86%) FVL/ PTH/MTHFR heterozygous, 2 (0,57%) PTH hetero/MTHFR homozygous, 2 (0,57%) FVL/PTH heterozygous, 1 (0,29%) FVL homozygous muta tions) and only one case with double PTH/MTHFR mutations in control group. There was a strong correlation between combinations of these muta tions and development of thromboembolism, together with other complica tions, during pregnancy and postpartum. Conclusions: Existence of these double and triple mutations indicates high distribution of inherited thrombophilia in Georgian population. Therefore we confirm a significant role of inherited thrombophilia, especially combi ned forms of mutations in development of pregnancy complications with severe thromboembolism during pregnancy and postpartum.

26537,"Introduction. We describe a young couple with a history of four in utero fetal deaths at 7 23 weeks of gestation. All fetuses presented with severe IUGR, multiple congenital anomalies and fetal hydrops. The parents are first degree cousins of Muslim Arab origin from Northern Israel. They have two healthy daughters. Recurrent in utero fetal deaths with severe fetal malformations have a wide differential diagnosis. Family history and consanguinity directed toward autosomal recessive inheritance; therefore, whole exome sequencing was utilized. Methods. Following parental informed consent, whole exome sequencing was conducted on a fetus and both parentsÃ¢ÂÂ genomic DNA using IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs NextSeq platform. Variant analysis focused on rare pathogenic homozygous changes, followed by Sanger validation and co segregation analysis. Results. Exome analysis revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the GBA gene, NM_000157.3: c.820G>A (p. Glu274Lys).Discussion. Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder with genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity caused by deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. The lethal type is typically depicted in utero or during the neonatal period as hydrops and/or congenital ichthyosis with severe progressive neurologi cal symptoms. The p. Glu274Lys mutation has previously been described as disease causing in conjunction with another deleterious variant, showing a 100% decrease of GBA enzymatic activity; our family describes the first occurrence of this variant in a homozygous manner. Lethal Gaucher disease is rarely diagnosed due to the clinical difficulty of re cognizing it in utero. Our family emphasizes that lysosomal storage diseases should be suspected in recurrent in utero fetal deaths with severe fetal mal formations and hydrops fetalis.

There are two types of this chromosomal anomalies according to centromere po sition thus if the inversion segment includes centromere is called pericen tric so break points are in each arm or thus if doesnÃ¢ÂÂt include centromere so both breaks occur in one arm is called paracentric inversion types. This chromosomal aberation usually may not cause any phenotypically effects on carriers as if the inversion segment is ballanced but when the rearran gement is unbalanced with extra or missing DNA may due to miscarriage and infertility. In our case, a 25 years old female represented by pericentric inversion on chromosome 4 applied of prediagnostic infertility also our case had been ÃÂ±vf pregnancy but resulted abortion.

Methods: Retrospective record review of prenatal LUTO cases at Tygerberg Hospital, South Africa, between January 2003 and June 2014.Results: 75 prenatal LUTO cases were detected in 12 years, with a fre quency of 1.2 per 10,000 births calculated over 3 years. The median gesta tion at diagnosis was 22.4 weeks. Prenatally 39 (52%) were classified as Ã¢ÂÂIsolatedÃ¢ÂÂ, 16 (21%) as Ã¢ÂÂIsolated with markerÃ¢ÂÂ and 20 (27%) as Ã¢ÂÂComplexÃ¢ÂÂ. Gender difference observed with predominance of males (60/68) (88%), male:female ratio 7.5:1. Males had predominantly Ã¢ÂÂIsolated LUTOÃ¢ÂÂ (n,36, 60%), and females Ã¢ÂÂComplex LUTOÃ¢ÂÂ (n,5, 63%). Survival outcomes inclu ded: TOP 26 (35%), IUD 1 (1%), Stillbirths 8 (11%), NND 12 (16%), Infant deaths 4 (5%), alive >1 year 16 (21%), Lost to follow up/Unknown 8 (11%). The most common etiology was PUV (51%). Chromosomal aneuploidy was found in 9.3% (7/75), all in males, with Trisomy 21 the most common ano maly (4/7) (57%). Prenatal findings shown to be significantly associated with a Ã¢ÂÂPoor outcomeÃ¢ÂÂ are bilateral renal cortex echogenic/cystic changes (p,0.029), anhydramnios (p,0.011) and pulmonary hypoplasia (p,0.003).

Inspection and Investigation: Here we present data from 34 year old pati ent complaining about his inability to have children with his partner. There were no significant health problems in childhood. Urological examination revealed testicular hypoplasia and his spermogram showed azoospermia. Phenotypically patient has short stature and eunuchoid voice. Screening of the AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc regions did not detect any chromosome Y microde letions. Cytogenetic analysis of 50 metaphase spreads from peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures revealed mosaic karyotype: 45,X[44]/46,X,idic(Y)(p11.3)[16]. One cell line had monosomy X, while other had isodicentric chromosome Y, which was composed of two chromosomes Y fused at ter minal segments of p arms. According to literature, this karyotype determi nes various male fertility disorders. Isodicentric chromosomes are the most commonly reported aberrations of the chromosome Y. Phenotypes of mo saic karyotype may vary from male to abnormal female or individual with ambiguous genitalia. Conclusion: Although our patient has mosaic karyotype without normal ka ryotype cell line, he lives a normal life without physical symptoms or other complaints about health, except for primary infertility.

The accumulated data and functional model experiments confirm the concept of the impact of microRNAs on disease development. MiRNAs regulate genes by binding to their transcripts, while the coefficient of miRNA binding is directly proportional to its regulatory capacity. Current study is to predict miRNA that regulate genes included in pathobiology of uterine fibroids. Materials and methods. We analyzed the intergene spaces located in sur roundings of 35 genes of the pathogenesis. Full sequences were obtained from NCBI data base using E utilities API. miRNA sequences were taken from the miRBase release 21. Binding sites search was carried out with Mi Randa and GLAM2Scan program combination. The results were filtered to yield only those matches with 95% identical nucleotides. Results: The entire set of non coding DNA sequences around 35 genes con tains 164 miRNA binding sites of miR 619, miR 5096, miR 1273(g,h,f,e), miR 8485, miR 1273e, miR 5585, miR 548d 2, miR 1285 1 and miR 545.

Described allele variants combination is a high risk factor for the first trimester pregnancy loss (OR , 17,3 ÃÂ , 0,01). 9,9% of women with EPL had genotype 31ÃÂ¡ÃÂ¡ IL 1ÃÂ² / 174GC IL 6 / CT677 MTHFR / 66ÃÂG MTRR that is 3,9 fold higher rate than in control group (OR , 4,3 ÃÂ , 0,03). Shift in inflammatory reactions intensity, inclu ding that caused by cytokines gene variants, is a risk factor for pregnancy. Pro inflammatory cytokines can act as a mediators between inflammation and hypercoagulation. Hyperhomocysteinemia can cause the development of numerous pathologies through pro inflammatory cytokines expression up regulation, oxidative stress induction, apoptosis activation and methyla tion processes dysregulation.

26549,"Introduction: Small supernumerary marker chromosomes are defined as extra and abnormal chromosomes whose derivation and content cant be typically determined by G banding techniques. Approximately 70% of SMCs are de novo and 30% are inherited. Materials and Method: Here, we report a case of sSMC identified in prenatal diagnoÃÂ¬sis . A 36 year old pregnant woman was monitored due to advanced maternal age. The amniocentesis was performed at 17 weeks of gesÃÂ¬tation. The fetal karyotype was obtained from an amniotic fluid cells. Results: Conventional cytogenetics analysis revealed an abnorÃÂ¬mal ka ryotype 47,XY,+mar detected in all metaphases. Both parents had normal karyotypes. Molecular investigaÃÂ¬tion by FISH were carried out in the Jena, Institute for Human Genetics.

After a complete genetics analysis, the parents were infor med that there are several cases small SMC(15)s described in the literature which did not show any clinical abnormalities regardless inherited or de novo, and those cases were not directly associated with an abnormal pheno type. After this information and ultrasound findings, the parents decided to continue with the pregnancy and keep the baby. In week 40 of the gestation a boy was born, now 3 years old, phenotypically healthy and with normal intelligence level. Conclusions: In such cases it is necessary to do molecular investigaÃÂ¬tion by FISH in order to exclude the presence of critical region of Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes. E",2016

26551,"Introduction: The karyotype of a spontaneously aborted conceptus provides valuable clinical information. Chromosomal abnormalities (mostly aneu ploidy) account for ~50% of fetal losses in the first 8Ã¢ÂÂ15 weeks of gestation. For later (15 24 weeks) losses the frequency is approximately 20 %. Most of ABSTRACTS ELECTRONIC POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 415Back to index them are numerical aberrations such as polyploidy, trisomy, or monosomy X. Materials and Methods: Cytogenetics study of 468 samples products of con ception was performed. G banding cytogenetic results were obtainable in 153 cases. For the analysis of products of conception where banding analy sis was not possible due to absence of metaphases mFISH analysis was per formed. Interphase mFISH with the probe panel for chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, X and Y was performed on 315 uncultured cell suspen sions from spontaneous abortions samples.

26552,"GonorrhoeaÃÂµ, Ureaplasma and Gardnerella are among the most common se xually transmitted bacterial infections which lead to spontaneous abortion. The aim of our research was to monitor the frequency of these infections among spontaneous abortions in Bulgarian population. For this reason we examined endometrial tissue derived from 100 patients using PCR technique. Patients were divided into two groups 1) control group of 40 patients with voluntarily interrupted pregnancy and 2) target group of 60 patients with spontaneous abortion for unspecified reasons. In one of spontaneous abortion cases (1.7%) we found Ureaplasma parvum. Gardnerella vaginalis was found in five of the patients with spontaneous abortion (8%) and eleven of the control group patients (27.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeaÃÂµ and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections were not found. Cur rent results demonstrate high frequency (10%) of several sexually transmit ted bacterial infections in spontaneous abortion. More profound analysis of these results is needed by comparing with additional control group patients with successfully completed pregnancy, because of the high possibility of genital infections in this examined control group patients with voluntarily interrupted pregnancy. The study of association between spontaneous abortions and sexually transmitted bacterial infections will help spontaneous abortion prevention using adequate treatment.

26553,"Introduction: Opitz syndrome was first described in 1969 and is characteri zed by a variable expression of midline defects. In 2015 the causative gene SPECC1L (22q11.2) of the autosomal dominant form of the condition was described. We report a novel missense mutation in SPECC1L in a family with ocular hypertelorism, bicornuate uterus and diaphragmatic hernia. Material and Methods: The proband, a 28 year old woman, presented with prominent ocular hypertelorism at birth. Chromosome analysis revealed a normal 46,XX karyotype. She developed normally and was not genetically nor clinically diagnosed until she was referred to genetic counselling after having undergone termination of pregnancy due to fetal diaphragmatic her nia. Additionally, the fetus had a bicornuate uterus; a feature that was also reported in the proband herself. Before the diagnosis was established, the proband was pregnant again. Ultrasound examination and subsequent fe tal autopsy revealed a phenotype similar to that of the first fetus. Chromo somal microarray and sequencing of MID1 (X linked Opitz syndrome) was performed as SPECC1L analysis was not offered in a clinical setting. Further diagnostics proceeded with hotspot Sanger sequencing of SPECC1L on a re search basis. Results: A novel de novo missense mutation in SPECC1L, c.1258G>A, was found in the proband and subsequently in the two fetuses. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that a clinical diagnosis is paramount in the prenatal setting reducing turnaround time as a targeted analysis strat egy can be applied. The bicornuate uterus and diaphragmatic hernia repor ted in this family broaden the spectrum of phenotypic features in Opitz and SPECC1L hypertelorism syndromes. E",2016
26554,"Introduction: Azoospermia is defined as complete absence of sperm from ejaculate and approximately occurs in 10 15 percent of infertile men with abnormal semen analysis. Genetic factors including microdeletions in the Y chromosome and single gene mutations are contributed to non obstructive azoospermia. Recently, genome wide association studies have identified the STAG3 gene as a strong candidate gene for human male infertility. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of AZF deletions and mutation analysis of the Stag3 gene among Iranian infertile men with idiopathic non obstructive azoospermia. Materials and methods:A total of 122 Iranian azoospermic infertile men were selected.

Existence of possible mutations in exon 7 of Stag3 gene was also investigated using mul titemperature single strand conformation polymorphism (MSSCP) method. One hundred fertile men were also studied as control group. Results: Thirteen (10.66%) patients showed Y chromosome microdeletions and among these, deletion in AZFc region was the most frequent. However, no mutation was detected in the Stag domain coded by exon 7 of the STAG3 gene. Conclusion: According to the results, in the studied population, the main causing factor in developing azoospermia was Y chromosome microdeleti ons. Therefore, we did not suggest STAG3 gene as a strong candidate gene in non obstructive azoospermia. E",2016
26555,"Introduction: Genetic material exchange between homologous chromo somes occurs in somatic and germ cells. This type of exchanges in certain cases may occur in non allelic chromosomal regions resulting in structural chromosomal anomalies in form of translocations. Translocations are cate gorized in two general types namely balanced and unbalanced. Balanced reciprocal translocations can risk the pregnancy as it may produce unba lanced gametes. Materials and Methods: The amniotic fluid (20ml) belonged to a 27 years old female patient in 18th week of her pregnancy who was admitted to the Polyclinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Faculty of Medicine in Mersin University was sent to laboratory for cytogenetic analysis. Parents were not consanguinity. Amniotic material was processed using the in situ cultu re method and GTG banding technique. 39 metaphase plates (20 colonies) were obtained and cytogenetic analyses performed on these plates. Results: As a result of the cytogenetic analysis, the fetus was determined to be 46,XX,der(5)t(5;14)(p13;p11)mat karyotype. The cytogenetic analysis that was performed on peripheral blood samples taken from the parents showed that the finding was not de novo but of maternal origin. Conclusions: Incidence of reciprocal translocations in the amniocentesis is 0.06%. Balanced reciprocal translocations do not change the amount of chromosomes and genetic materials. However they may cause unbalanced chromosomal rearrangement in the gametes of these carriers. Although the reciprocal translocation in our case is unbalanced.

26556,"Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by progressive corneal opacity that starts in early childhood and ultimately progresses to blindness in early adulthood. The aim of this study was to identify the cause of type I MCD in a black South African Sotho speaking family with two affected sisters using whole exome sequencing. Variant filtering to identify the MCD causal mutation included the inheritance pattern, variant minor allele frequency and potential func tional impact. Ophthalmologic evaluation of the cases revealed a typical MCD phenotype and none of the other family members were affected. Vari ant filtering identified a homozygous E71Q mutation in CHST6, a previously identified MCD causing gene encoding corneal N acetyl glucosamine 6 O sulfotransferase, as the MCD causal mutation in this family. This E71Q mu tation results in a non conservative amino acid change in a highly conserved functional domain of the human CHST6 that is essential for enzyme activity. This is the first description of MCD in a black Sub Saharan African family and therefore contributes valuable insights into the genetic aetiology of this disease, while improving genetic counselling for this and potentially other MCD families.

Posterior embryotoxon with iridocorneal adhesions are always present and iris stromal thinning or atrophy, corectopia, iris holes and iris ectropi on are common. Approximately half of the ARS patients develop glaucoma. Systemic anomalies like craniofacial anomalies and cardiovascular can also be present. Mutations and CNV in FOXC1 and PITX2 have been previously reported in ARS patients. A DNA sample of a 14 month old male with bilateral glaucoma, posterior embryotoxon with extension of the peripheral iris to SchwalbeÃ¢ÂÂs line, short stature, hypertelorism, frontal prominence, broad flat nasal root, maxillary hypoplasia and unilateral testicular atrophy was sequenced for the whole exome with the Ion Proton sequencer. Rare variants with functional impact were selected to identify the disease causing variant. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate the mutation in the patient and to study the parents. A novel heterozygous nonsense variant Y64X (c.192 C>G) was found in the FOXC1 gene. This de novo mutation leads to the loss of 88.6% of the protein, including the functional FHD domain. The presence of de novo FOXC1 mutation confirms the ARS diagnosis. This result is consonant with previous studies that report a positive association between FOXC1 mutations and ARS patients with glaucoma. Further studies will be needed to understand the pathogenic mechanism of this mutation. S.

The analysis yielded several candidate variants in genes which were previously associated with various ocular disorders. Candidate vari ants were further analyzed using Sanger sequencing and restriction analy sis. Only a single heterozygous c.392A>G missense mutation in BMP4, re sulting in a p.

Autosomal recessive congenital cataracts form a clinically diverse and ge netically heterogeneous group of the crystalline lens disorders. To identify the genetic cause of congenital nuclear cataract in Yakut family with three affected siblings from isolate Yakut population in Eastern Siberia (Sakha Republic, Russia) we performed whole exome sequencing on Illumina NextSeq 500 in one proband. For the first time, we have revealed homo zygous c.1621C>T (chr3:46009205G>A) transition in previously known in association with congenital cataract gene FYCO1 (3p21.31). Detected mu tation is not reported in the Ã¢ÂÂ1000 GenomesÃ¢ÂÂ, the ESP6500, and the ExAC projects. The c.1621C>T transition leads to premature stop codon forma tion (p.

ADCC repre sents around 10% of a treatable cause of childhood blindness. More than 30 loci have been associated to ADCC. Gamma crystallin genes are a family of 6 genes (4 CRYBA and 2 CRYBB) located on several chromosomes, this family of genes is associated to congenital cataract. The aim of the present study is to describe a Mexican family affected with ADCC and clinical diversity in three generations through whole exome sequencing (WES). Material and methods: Genomic DNA was analyzed through WES and DNA sequencing. Results: we detected a dominant CRYGA gene defect in exon 2 that produced the p. N18I change. This transversion mutation (c.53A>T) only co segrega ted in the affected members of the family and was not found in non affected members and in 100 normal controls. Bioinformatic analysis detected this mutation as deleterious. This missense mutation has not been previously reported; nevertheless more studies are necessary to confirm this type of mutations as deleterious. This is the first Mexican family ADCC with this mu tation. WES is a powerful tool for the detection of genetic origins of cataracts due to genetic and clinical heterogeneity in this type of disease.

26564,"Background and aims: MÃÂ©niÃÂ¨reÃ¢ÂÂs Disease (MD) is an inner ear disorder cha racterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss and aural fullness. It may arise from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. To date the genetic investigation didnÃ¢ÂÂt produce conclusive results. Our previous work suggested a role for alpha Adducin, a cytoskeletal prote in regulating the Na + K+ pump activity, in MD patients. Since ionic homeosta sis in the inner ear is crucial for the maintenance of endocochlear potential, in this work we studied the variants of genes involved in the regulation of ionic transport. Materials and methods: 155 patients with definite MD were enrolled and ac curately phenotyped. 137 control subjects without a lifetime history of ver tigo were included. 36 SNPs located in 25 genes involved in ionic transport have been selected from a panel of polymorphisms associated to essential hypertension. Correction for multiple comparison tests has been performed applying a false discovery rate of 10%. Logistic regression analysis has been implemented to compute odds ratio, genetic interactions and genetic score effect. Results: Four SNPs in 3 genes (SLC8A1, CYP11B2 and SIK1) displayed a significant difference in allelic and genotypic frequency (p,0.01/0.006; p,0.028/0.009; p,0.009/0.016 and p,0.024/0.01) in MD patients compa red to controls.

Our aim was to characterize the ophthalmological phenotype associating to the previously reported homozygous c.427_428delCT NEUROD1 mutation. Materials and Methods: The female patient was investigated on multiple occasions for 6 years, including visual acuity testing, automated perimetry, funduscopy, anterior segment imaging, optical coherence tomography of the posterior pole, standard full field electroretinography, and fundus au tofluorescence imaging. Results: The patient suffered from nyctalopia, blurry vision, visual field con striction from childhood. Her best corrected visual acuity ranged between 20/25 and 15/25. Perimetry showed concentric constriction in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography revealed total absence of the photoreceptor layer of the retina outside the fovea, where a discoid remnant of cone pho toreceptors could be detected. The standard full field electroretinography could not detect electrical response from the retina. Color fundus photos presented peripheral chorioretinal atrophy and central RPE mottling.

Materials and Methods: 766 healthy individuals of the main ethnic groups of Karachay Cherkessia were screened for 35delG mutation in the GJB2 gene (Karachays (N , 370), Cherkessians (N , 102), Russians (N , 35), Abazyns (N , 137), Nogays (N , 122)). Results: Population frequencies of 35delG mutation in Russians is 0.0143 (heterozygous carrier rate 1:35), in Karachais 0.00135 (1:370), in Cherkes sians 0.0098 (1:51), in Abaza 0.0145 (1:34), in Nogays 0.0041 (1:122).Conclusion: These differences result from origins and ethnogenesis of the peoples. Karachays belong to Caucasian anthropological type of the Balkan Caucasian Caucasian race. They speak Karachai Balkar language of Kipchak group of Turkic family. Nogays are much younger, time of its formation refers to the end of the XIV century. They are Turkified tribes of Mongol branch; speak one of the Turkic languages. Circassians and Abaza are Abkhaz Adyg he peoples; speaking Adyghe languages of Abkhaz Adyghe language group. This work was partially funded by RFBR grants 14 04 00525, 15 04 01859. E",2016
26567,"Introduction. Oculocerebrorenal syndrome (Lowe syndrome) is caused by mutations in the OCRL 1 gene. It is a rare recesive X linked disorder (1:500,000 people) characterized by eye, kidney and neurological impair ment. Males are mostly affected. Cataracts and glaucoma are characteristic ocular findings in these patients and visual acuity may be impaired. Child ren with Lowe syndrome have delayed development, behavioral problems, feeding difficulties. The progressive kidney dysfunction can lead to chronic renal failure. Polyuria, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte inbalan ce and osteopenia are present. Matherial and Methods. We present a five years old boy with delayed de velopment, protein energy malnutrition, severe vitamin D deficiency and femur fracture. The case was evaluated by means of anamnesis, physical examination, paraclinical tests (imaging, functional, biology) and interdis ciplinary check ups. Results. The patient exhibits typical facial appearance (elongated face, deep set small eyes, frontal bossing), failure to thrive (BMI ,12, below the 5th percentile for age and sex), congenital cataracts, corneal keloids, delayed motor and mental development, weak muscle tone, and self injurios beha vior. Proteinuria, aminoaciduria and albuminuria reveal renal tubular da mage. Diagnosis of osteopenia was set by the presence of femoral fracture, severe vitamin D deficiency and confirmed through osteodensitometry.

26568,"The aim of the study was to identify the genetic background of retinitis pig mentosa (RP) in a Polish family with previously excluded involvement of the majority of known RP genes except for the ORF15 exon in the RPGR gene (Xp21.1). ORF15 is a highly repetitive, purine rich DNA region with a num ber of different polymorphic variants and thus difficult to study. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of the family members (n , 9). Exon ORF15 was amplified in a long range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced using the new generation method (NGS). Presence of the identi fied variant was confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing of the amplicon en compassing the mutation. In the ORF15 region NM_001034853:c.2899delG (p. E967Kfs*122) mutation was detected. It completely segregated with the disease in the studied family. The identified change is pathogenic and has already been found to cause RP . It is estimated that more than a half of RPGR mutations is located in the ORF15 region. In families with a suspected X linked inheritance of RP and in males with a negative family history of RP genetic tests should begin with analysis of ORF15.This work was supported by the Medical University of Warsaw Grant 1M15/N/2015 and the project entitled Ã¢ÂÂIntegrated System of Tools Desi gned for Diagnostics and Telerehabilitation of the Sense Organs Disorders (Hearing, Vision, Speech, Balance, Taste, Smell)Ã¢ÂÂ INNOSENSE, cofinanced by the National Centre for Research and Development within the STRATEG MED Program.

26569,"Background and aims: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a multifaceted condition with profound medical, social, and cultural ramifications. For children born with moderate to profound hearing impairment, particularly in families in which there is no previous history of deafness, the diagnosis has a major impact on that family. Objectives: Testing for mutations in GJB2, the gene for connexin 26 (Cx26), can account for up to 60% of prelingual nonsyndromic hearing impairment, is commercially available, and many more deafness related genetic tests undoubtedly will follow in the near future. Methods: In our study, we performed mutation screening for GJB2 in 42 non syndromic hearing loss families, including those with cases of sporadic deafness. Peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA was used to amplify by poly merase chain reaction the Cx26 coding region, followed by 35delG mutation detection screening and complete sequencing. For DNA extraction we used QIAamp DNA Blood (QIAGEN), and PCR fragments were sequenced using the forward primer and the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. Results: The most frequent mutation was 35delG, followed by 167delT . In our study, we identified other mutations such: R32C, I20T , S19T and a com pound heterozygous mutation 35delG/ R127H. However, a large fraction 68% have only one mutant allele. Conclusions: The high frequency of the 35delG mutation indicated its scree ning, regardless severity of hearing impairment or familial history. On the other hand, these results highlight the usefulness of 35del G mutation scree ning for genetic counseling and suggest the importance of entire sequencing of the gene responsible for DNFB1.E",2016
26570,"Hereditary sensorineural Non Syndromic Hearing Loss (NSHL) is characte rized by clinically indistinguishable phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity that up until recently have hampered effective early aetiological diagnosis. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies offer unprecedented dia gnostic capacities and hold the promise of a significant expansion in know ledge on the pathogenic role of many disease genes. The CDH23 gene (NM_022124) encodes a calcium dependent cell cell ad hesion glycoprotein, involved in stereocilia organization and hair bundle formation; its mutations, initially described as associated with Usher syn drome type 1D, are also responsible of autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss. By NGS strategy on Ion Torrent PGM platform, we have developed a multige nic NSHL panel which is integral in our NSHL molecular diagnostic pipeline. This NGS approach has lead to the identification of two CDH23 mutations in two sisters, aged 16 and 11, affected with congenital profound sensori neural non syndromic hearing loss. No retinal alterations are present. The two girls had previously been found to carry a pathogenic GJB2 sequence variant. The novel CDH23 variants: a missense mutation, c.6530C>A (p. P2177H), predicted as damaging by consent of in silico tools, and a splice site mu tation c.8966 1G>C, were both Sanger validated. Compound heterozygosi ty in the sisters was confirmed by mutation analysis in the normal hearing parents, who were found to be heterozygotes. Our report, which describes two novel CDH23 mutations, provides evidence of the fact that truncating mutations of this gene, frequently found in Usher syndrome patients, may also be associated with non syndromic sensorineu ral deafness.

26571,"Introduction: Usher syndrome is mostly characterized by hearing impair ment (HI) and adolescent onset retinitis pigmentosa. It is categorized into two major types. Materials and Methods: In this study a pedigree with two affected members were investigated. A 16 years old male with profound HI, rod cone degene ration, and clinical diagnosis of Usher syndrome, result of a consanguineous marriage, was referred for genetic counseling/analysis. The proband had a one year old cousin, also result of a consanguineous marriage, with pro found HI. Target region capturing of 13 Usher syndrome related genes (CDH23, DFNB31, GPR98, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, USH1G, USH2A, CLRN1, HARS, PDZD7, CIB2, and ABHD12 ) was performed followed by next genera tion sequencing (NGS).Results: A novel homozygous variant in MYO7A gene was detected in the proband as NM_000260:c.4513G>T(p. Glu1505*). It was detected in homo zygous state in the other affected member of the pedigree by Sanger sequen cing. Segregation analysis was consistent with the AR pattern of inheritance. This variant was absent in population (1000G, ExAC, dbSNP) and disease specific (ClinVar, OMIM, HGMD) databases, predicted to be disease causing by multiple in silico predictive tools (mutation taster, SIFT , PolyPhen, CADD), and the substituted nucleotide was evolutionally well conserved (ConSurf, phyloP , phastCons).Conclusions: Based on the ACMG standards and guidelines for interpreta tion of sequence variants, it is classified as a pathogenic variant. Although MYO7A is the most common gene causing Usher syndrome typeI, NGS was able to detect this novel mutation. Therefore applying NGS in less investiga ted populations can still detect novel variants, even in well studied genes for different disorders.

26572,"Segmental renal infarction is a rare condition in children, resulting from small arteries occlusion and responsible for renovascular hypertension.

Nonenhanced CT shows multiple small (and larger) areas of renal parenchymal scarring, coexisting with normal appearing kidney. The renal sonography was normal at age 3.5.The cause of CKD remains unknown but multiple arteries occlusions and chronic ischemia are suspected. In absence of hypercoagulable factors or renal artery injury, this unusual presentation raises the hypothesis of a rela tionship between ARID1b and segmental renal infarction.

26574," Introduction: CCHS belongs to rare genetic disorders. It is characterized by hypoventilation secondary to absent responses to both hypercapnia and hypoxia being most pronounced during the sleep. CCHS has been shown to result from mutations in the PHOX2B gene located on chromosome 4p12.3.Materials and Methods: A rare familial case of CCHS caused by polyalanine expansion mutation of PHOX2B gene with significant phenotype variabili ty in three generations. Case 1: A girl firstly admitted to the hospital with a history of severe cyanosis and respiratory failure related to pneumonia at six weeks of the age. Until four years of age, she was five times hospi talized because of respiratory failure in connection with respiratory tract infection. Case 2: a seemingly asymptomatic patientÃ¢ÂÂs father. Retrospectively we learned that he suffered from a severe headache and excessive daytime sleepiness. Both daughter and her father require overnight mechanical ven tilatory support now. Case 3: PatientÃ¢ÂÂs grandmother who died after general anaesthesia at fifty years of age. Results: Genetic testing revealed that the patient and her father are he terozygous for a polyalanine repeat expansion mutation of the PHOX2B gene (casual mutation c.741_755dup15 in exon 3 of PHOX2B). Considering grandmotherÃ¢ÂÂs history, she is highly suspected of having CCHS as well. Conclusion: Although most CCHS PHOX2B mutations occur de novo, autoso mal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance has been proposed. The increased attention should be paid to seemingly asymptomatic relatives as they are at increased risk of complications associated with respiratory infections, general anaesthesia, and drugs known to depress ventilation.

Transcriptio nal factor NF ÃÂºB has a key role in transcription of genes that mediate these events. The aim of this study was to elucidate molecular patterns that un derlie these processes. We analyzed expression levels of proinflammatory IL 6 and TNF ÃÂ±, and apo ptotic Bcl 2, Bax, Fas and FasL genes in intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 24 patients with active CD and 21 con trols, using qRT PCR methodology. Among these participants, we selected 10 CD patients and 5 controls in order to conduct EMSA analysis of the DNA binding activity of NF ÃÂºB from the nuclear extracts of donorsÃ¢ÂÂ intestinal mu cosal samples. Results showed that expression levels of IL 6 and TNF ÃÂ± were significantly increased, while expression level of Bcl 2 was significantly decreased in ileal inflamed mucosa of CD patients. Our results also revealed that the expres sion level of FasL in PBMC of male CD patients was significantly decreased. The analysis of the DNA binding activity of NF ÃÂºB revealed an association of decreased level of NF ÃÂºB binding activity and increased expression level of TNF ÃÂ± with intestinal mucosal fragility.

26578,"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, most common among Caucasian children. It is caused by mutations in CFTR gene which plays a role in the regulation of transmembrane hydroelectrolytic flux. The most common form of cystic fibrosis is associated with respiratory symptoms, pancreatic insufficiency, etc. There is considerable genotype phenotype association but the rare mutations in CFTR gene hampers this objective. Case: A 9 month old girl with positive neonatal screening for cystic fibro sis (on the basis of sweat test results chloride concentration of 79 mmol/L) must be confirmed by identification of CFTR gene mutations. Recurrent mutation CFTR panel was firstly analyzed. Traditional but precise Sanger DNA sequencing were used to search for specific mutations in the CFTR gene followed by MLPA CFTR gene deletion insertions variants. Early detection of pancreatic insufficiency is essential to optimize health and outcomes in cystic fibrosis patients. Faecal elastase and other test were employed to measure pancreatic insufficiency. The results were associated with pancreatic insufficiency. The research participants were the mother, the father and the paternal uncle and paternal aunt besides two brothers of the affected girl.

The prevalence is 1 in 7,000. We report data of two brothers with similar clinical and laboratory findings born in a non consanguineous family. The eldest brother was two years old at the time of genetic consultation, and the youngest brother was four months old. The brothers presented severe sharp spasmodic pain in the backs, sides, and abdominal areas. We measured markedly increased con centrations of protein and red blood cells in the brothersÃ¢ÂÂ urine.

In the pediatric age group, primary FSGS usually underlies steroid resistant ne phrotic syndrome, and is caused by both idiopathic and genetic causes. We present a 10 year old boy, born to healthy Muslim Arab first degree cousins, who was referred to the Pediatric Nephrology Institute with end stage renal disease secondary to FSGS. Nephrotic syndrome was suspected and genetic testing was pursued. Methods: The TruSightÃ¢ÂÂ¢ One panel, was employed on IlluminaÃ¢ÂÂs Next Seq500. Analysis focused on variation in candidate genes, followed by filte ring rare variants (<0.05%). We prioritized the variants using the VarElect tool with relevant clinical search terms. Results: No pathogenic variants were detected in candidate genes, mainly NPHS1, NPHS2, and WT1. Further analysis revealed a homozygous variant in the ARHGAP24 gene, NM_001025616.2:c.1442C>T; p. T481M. This vari ant was previously implicated in association with FSGS.

26583,"Background: Obesity is at epidemic levels worldwide. Insulin resistance, one of its complications, could be prevented/addressed through diet and medication. Therefore determining, at young age, which obese patients are predisposed to develop insulin resistance is important for clinical practice. Aim: To provide a study design that would translate the findings form GWAS studies regarding insulin resistance into a model with high predictive value for use in the clinical setting. Method: We reviewed the literature for GWAS studies regarding insulin re sistance, and evaluated the potential cost and benefit for a genetic model involved in insulin resistance. Results: Over 250 loci are significantly and robustly associated with type 2 diabetes(T2D) and/or obesity related traits. However, less than 20 loci are directly associated with HOMA IR in adults. For a robust predictive model, sample size needs to be larger than 2500. With a cross sectional design, the price for clinical/metabolic assessment and genotyping is significant. Im portantly, some studies replicating GWAS results on insulin resistance, have found only a slight increase in predictive ability of a model(using regressi on/neuronal networks) after adding the genetic signature specific for insu lin resistance, while the BMI provided the highest predictive value. Conclusion: Presently, clinical utility for prognosis of common variants who se allele frequencies are statistically correlated with insulin resistance is not established. Although, replication studies are costly, we plan to develop such a study to assess the improvement in significance of risk stratification, in our Genomic Centre.

Next, we expanded HLA genotyping based associati on analyses to the other HLA class II genes, HLA DQA1, DQB1 and DRB1. Unexpectedly, some DRB1 DQA1 DQB1 haplotypes clearly showed stronger associations than DPA1 DPB1 haplotypes. Furthermore, GWAS and HLA genotyping based association analysis on HBV related hepatocellular carci noma (HCC) identified new protective alleles in HLA class I genes in additi on to previously identified HLA DPB1 protective allele. Since many diseases have been reported to be strongly associated with the HLA region by means of SNP based GWAS, careful association studies based on HLA genotyping are essential to identify the primary susceptibility variants in this particular genome region.

26586," Introduction: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) show increasing incidence in the last few years in Hungary. Since genetic susceptibility of patients plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease, it is important to iden tify new susceptibility genes. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) is expressed in the colon and has protective effects against inflammatory processes. Our aim was to examine the association of four po lymorphisms of PPARÃÂ³ in a well characterized Hungarian IBD cohort. Material and Methods: 575 CrohnÃ¢ÂÂs disease (CD), 103 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and 486 sex and age matched controls were examined in our study. Four polymorphisms of PPARÃÂ³ [rs10865710 (C 681G), rs2067819, rs3892175 and rs1801282 (Pro12Ala)] were genotyped by TaqMan geno typing assays. Results: The Pro12Ala polymorphism showed significant association with CD when the frequencies of the homozygous variants (Pro/Pro vs. Ala/Ala) were compared. The minor Ala/Ala genotype was significantly less frequent in CD patients compared to the controls (OR, 0.33; 95%CI, 012 0.94; P, 0.03), suggesting a potential protective effect of the Ala allele. GAGG haplo type of PPARg also confers protective effect in CD (OR, 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53 0.97; P, 0.028) and in UC (OR, 0.14; 95% CI: 0.05 0.42; P, 3.78 ÃÂ 10 5) too. While GAGC increases the risk of UC (OR, 6.70; 95% CI: 3.41 13.17; P, 3.85 ÃÂ 10 10). Conclusions: In the present study we demonstrated a significant association between PPARg polymorphisms and the development of CD and UC at single loci level and also in haplotype combinations.

26587,"Introduction: Laron syndrome (LS) is an autosomal recessive disorder cha racterized by severe postnatal growth failure, short stature, normal or in creased plasma growth hormone (GH), and low levels of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP 3). These characteristics result from defective GH receptor (GHR) function and, thus, a GH insensitive state. We analyzed the GHR gene for mutations and polymorphisms in a pa tients with Laron type dwarfism. Materials and Methods: Patients were selected in this study based on their clinical and laboratory characteristics. Genomic DNA was isolated from bloods of LS children according to salting out method. Exon 2 10 specific PCRs and their flanking splice sites were amplified by polymerase chain re action (PCR) using the primers. PCR products were visualized on 2% aga rose gels. Results: PCR results showed that GHR from patient was deleted from exon 4 10 and this deletion causes defective GHR missing intracellular domain, transmembrane domain and large part of extracellular domain (exon 4 7).Conclusions: We identified gross deletion (exon 4 10) from GHR gene in pa tient with Laron and this is second report for deletion of exon 4 10 of GHR in patient with laron syndrome.

BehÃÂ§etÃ¢ÂÂs disease (BD) is an inflammatory disease characterized with recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcerations, uveitis, and skin lesions. It has been reported that the MEFV gene mutation responsible for FMF is probably a susceptibility factor for BD, particularly for cases with vascular involvement, and both disorders can occur concurrently in a subject, as in this case. Herein, we present a case of Moroccan girl with FMF and BD coexistence. We analyzed the entire MEFV gene after exclusion of recurrent mutations in exons 2 and 10.

Besser et al. (2011) and Besser et al. (2013) have shown distinction is possible by utilising UCPCR. We examine the clinical utility of current screening criteria and UCPCR te sting in the Emirati population. Paediatric and adult cases are recruited and 2 hour post prandial UCPCR is determined. Next generation sequencing of known monogenic diabetes genes is performed to confirm a diagnosis of MODY and to help identify patients for the investigation of novel genetic ae tiologies in the Emirati population, by performing whole exome sequencing. Recruited patients were 126 type 1 diabetes and 16 type 2 diabetes pa ediatric patients and 67 type 1 diabetes and 64 type 2 diabetes adult pa tients. 2 Tailed Spearman correlation test showed that in type 1 diabetes patients, UCPCR was negatively correlated with duration of diabetes (r, 0.6, p < 0.001); there was a weak correlation between UCPCR and duration of diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes (r, 0.23, p, 0.044). UCPCR was significantly lower in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes with duration of less than 1 year (median 0.583) compared to more than 1 year (median 0.015) (p< 0.001).We suggest that UCPCR test could be valuable for discrimination between type 1 and type 2 diabetes and/or MODY in paediatric and adult Emirati patients and can lead to an earlier clinical diagnosis and adequate manage ment.

It is an autosomal recessive disor der caused by mutations in the MYO5B gene (MIM#606540) encoding the myosin Vb protein. The disorder is characterized by intractable secretory diarrhoea in infancy. Intestinal failure secondary to diarrhea is frequent and children with MVID are dependent on parenteral nutrition. Long term out come is generally poor. We report a patient who is now 30 years of age and who presented with unclassified cholestatic liver disorder and recurrent diarrhoea four weeks after birth. His two older brothers had died of an unclassified liver disor der in infancy. The clinical course in the patient reported here stabilized in the second year of life after which he suffered from occasional episodes of diarrhoea only, but presented with severe cholestatic liver disorder as the predominant clinical feature. The putative diagnosis of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC1/2) was established. However, molecular analysis of the ATP8B1 and ABCB11 genes did not reveal any pathogenic mutations, excluding PIFC1/2 as the likely diagnosis.

Materials and methods: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Tg. Mures. Our study included a number of 57 patients with NS and a control group which inclu ded 123 healthy persons. The gene polymorphisms were determined by the PCR and PCR RFLP techniques using specific primers. Results: Mutations (NPHS2) were detected in 100% of congenital onset NS. Patients with NS had a higher percentage of II and ID genotype than the control group (especially in girls). Conclusions: We were unable to show a relationship between VEGF I/D, TNFÃÂ± G308A, IL 6 174G>C gene polymorphism and NS. There is an associa tion beetwen NS and ACE I/D polymorphism, the deletion might be a pro tective factor and insertion a risk factor. Mutation in NPHS2 gene represent a risk factor for congenital NS.

Investigations on early onset/severe obesity have identified vari ants in genes acting on the central regulation of appetite. Of particular in terest is the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R). Mutations in this gene repre sent the most frequent cause of early onset non syndromic obesity. The aim of this investigation was to perform mutational screening of the MC4R exon in obese Maltese T2DM patients. MethodsWe sequenced the MC4R exon in 192 obese T2DM patients of Maltese ethni city. PCR amplification was followed by Sanger sequencing at GATC Biotech, Germany. ResultsMC4R sequence variants are uncommon in obese T2DM patients. Sequence electropherograms were screened for homozygous SNPs and insertion de letion variants (InDels). No homozygous SNPs or indels were detected in the studycohort. Sequence electropherograms were inspected to identify heterozy gous variants in the MC4R exon. Five cases (3 Males, 2 Females) were iden tified carrying the missense rs2229616 variant in the heterozygous state. rs2229616 C/T polymorphism results in a Valine to Isoleucinesubstitution at codon 103. Our data shows that MC4R mutations are rare, and do not contribute to adult obesity associated with insulin resistance in T2DM. These findings are in keeping with studies that showed that obesity causing mutations in MC4R have a very low prevalence in an obese cohort from Southern Italy.

METHODS: The population under study consisted of 116 Korean subjects (65 males, 51 females, mean age 30.4 yrs, range 1 88 yrs), diagnosed with idiopathic pancreatitis. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples, amplified by PCR and sequenced using the Sanger method. Mul tiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to assess copy number variations (CNVs) using an MLPA kit. Students t test (unpaired), ÃÂ2 test or FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test was used for analyzing data as ap propriate. RESULTS: We identified three types of PRSS1 mutations in 11 patients, in cluding N29I (n,1), R122H (n,1), and G208A (n,9). 16 patients exhibited heterozygous mutations in SPINK1, including c.194+2T>C (n,12) and N34S (n,3). A novel splicing mutation in the SPINK1 gene, c.194+1G>A, was found in a 41 yr old man diagnosed with pancreatic duct stone and chronic pan creatitis. A heterozygous CFTR Q1352H mutation was detected in 8 patients. One patient had a heterozygous CTRC P249L mutation that has been repor ted to be a high risk variant for pancreatitis. PRSS1 and SPINK1 gene copy numbers were normal in all patients. Weight loss occurred more frequently in patients carrying the G208A mutation, while pancreatic duct stones oc curred more frequently in patients with the c.194+2T>C mutation.

Our results showed that being a carrier of the allele G of ATG2B rs3759601 polymorphism and being a carrier of the allele C of the ATG16L1 rs2241880 polymorphism were associated with increased risk of developing ACS. The analysis of the NSTEMI patients versus STEMI patients showed us that being a carrier of the variant allele G of the ATG2B rs3759601 polymorphism in creased the risk of developing STEMI. The variant alleles of the ATG16L1 rs2241880 and the ATG2B rs3759601 polymorphisms are related with decreased autophagy process therefore our study suggests that a defective autophagy could be involved in an increased risk to suffer ACS.

26606," Introduction: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of high morta lity in Slovakia. Generally, men have a higher risk than women of developing coronary heart disease in middle age. We assumed that genetic variability in the Y chromosome (especially haplogroup I) could be a risk factor for a higher incidence of coronary artery disease in the Slovak male population independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and buccal swabs of 133 Slovak patients with CAD and 127 control samples. Males were genotyped for Y SNPs on 7500 Fast Real Time PCR instrument (Life Technologies) using TaqMan assays. We compared traditional cardio vascular risk factors in carriers of the haplogroup I and in men with other paternal lineages. Results: Based on analysis, haplogroup I was no significantly more common in men with coronary artery disease than in controls (24.81% [n,33] vs. 25.2% [n,32]). There were no significant differences in biochemical and clinical parameters between patients with paternal lineages I and patients with other Y haplogroup. We did not confirm the association between ha plogroup I and increased risk of coronary artery disease in this study (OR 0.9797, 95% CI 0.5578 to 1.7177, p,0.942).Conclusion: In Slovak population, our results showed the carriers of haplo group I are not more likely to suffer from coronary artery disease than men with other paternal lineage. None of the traditional cardiovascular risk fac tors associated with Y chromosomal haplogroup I. This study is the result of the project implementation VEGA 1/0563/14. E",2016
26607,"Introduction: Intracranial berry aneurysms (IBA) are a common disease that occur in 1 3% of the general population, and in 3.6 6.5% of adults over 30 years of age. Approximately 12 15% of patients have affected first degree relatives, and are considered to have familial intracranial aneurysms (FIA). No specific genetic variants causing isolated IBA or FIA have been identified thus far. The aim of this study is to identify rare DNA variants that are major risk factors for FIA. Methods and Results: This study currently has enrolled three families with FIA, and recruitment of additional families is ongoing. We analyzed family one using whole genome SNP microarrays to map genomic regions shared only among affected family members, in combination with whole exome se quencing (WES) to identify rare genetic variants in a single proband. Over lap of these data produced a list of 112 candidate variants. Whole genome sequencing will be performed on the proband of family two. WES will be performed on family three and on the probands of newly enrolled families. We describe a detailed workflow of the analysis of sequencing data obtained from these families. Candidate variants were selected for being rare and po tentially damaging, then subsequently prioritized by the geneÃ¢ÂÂs involvement in an associated syndrome, vascular function, or inflammation. Genes con taining candidate variants in multiple independent families will be modeled in zebrafish. Discussion: A validated FIA gene would be expected to identify a key protein in the molecular pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms in both its familial and sporadic forms.

26608,"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG) or activin recep tor like kinase 1 (ALK1, ACVRL1) genes. Clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of two (suspected) or more (definite) CuraÃÂ§aoÃÂ´s diagnostic crite ria. The majority of mutations reported on the International HHT Mutation Database (hhtmutation.org) are predicted to lead to stop codons, either due to frameshifts or direct nonsense substitutions. We reported our first re sults with genetic testing in the Czech Republic previously. We used classical sequencing approaches to perform molecular characterization in 12 new clinically affected individiuals. Coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of both genes were sequenced and we detected a total of 8 different muta tions in the two genes. Three known missense mutations were identified in the ACVRL1 gene, in exons 7 and 8. Three of five mutations identified in the ENG gene were novel with frameshift effect in exons 5 and 7, and two were known mutations one missense in exon 5 and splice site mutation in intron 8. No mutations were found in ENG/ACVRL1 in 4 probands. Our labo ratory has performed genetics testing for HHT on 28 probands since 2012. Approximately 54% of affected patients have at least one mutation in either endoglin or ACVRL1 gene. We plan to perform deletion/duplication analysis using MLPA (Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification analysis) in all patients with HHT retrospectively. E",2016
26609,"Introduction: Hypertension is an emerging public health problem and one of the most frequent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genetic of hyper tension varies from monogenic to polygenic multifactorial forms which the latter is developed by interaction of various genes and environmental fac tors. Here we present a narrative review to further elucidating the genetics of elevated blood pressure (BP).Material and Methods: Literature was searched through PubMed, dbGap and HuGE navigator and Google Scholar using a combination of following terms: hypertension or BP , genetic, genome wide association study (GWAS). Those manuscripts having data regarding the genes involving in monogenic hypertension or essential hypertension was included. After shortlisting re lated papers, most significant related genes and SNPs with monogenic and polygenic hypertension was included including most relevant studies such as WTCCC, CHARGE study, BRIGHT study, ICBP GWAS, The Global BPgen consortium. Results: BP heritability is estimated to be 30% to 50%, but GWAS results failed to unravel it. Large amount of this proposed heritability remained to be discovered which could be explained by primary overestimation of this measure. Limitation of GWAS to uncover underlying genetic cause might be due to not covering all common SNPs and the role of rare variants and lack of GWAS efficiency to detect them. Conclusions: Polygenic characteristic of BP which is manifested by smaller effect of large number of variant needs further studied and the result could alter the focus of disease management from treatment toward prevention, also personalized therapy by using different drug to remedy individuals with specific genotypes.

26610,"Tissue hypoxia, or ischemia, is the condition that describes the poor con veyance of oxygen and other vital products to tissues and organs. Up to now, the number one cause of death worldwide is caused by ischemia and related conditions such as heart attack or stroke. HIF 1ÃÂ± is a transcription activator that functions as a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. HIF 1ÃÂ± protein levels increase under hypoxic conditions as a result of decreased O2 depen dent prolyl hydroxylation, ubiqutination and degradation. We aimed to break up clots in blood vessels and to prevent damage caused by reperfusion by producing antioxidant enzymes using hypoxia inducible systems. We added oxygen dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF1ÃÂ± between and in front of TetR DNA binding domain and VP16 transactivation domain, so that TetR ODD VP16 or ODD TetR VP16 could activate transcrip tion of therapeutic genes controlled by tetracycline response element (TRE), in a HIF1ÃÂ± independent manner. In addition, we also designed therapatic ge nes under control of hypoxia response element (HRE) of HIF1ÃÂ± target genes. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay results showed the ex pression and nuclear localization of TetR ODD VP16 and ODD TetR VP16 constructs under hypoxic conditions, but not normoxic. In addition, using fluorometric reporter systems we proved functionality of these constructs under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, we developed hypoxia responsible systems that can be en gineered into endothelial cells to prevent ischemia related cardiovascular diseases.

26611,"Introduction ~ Jervell Lange Nielsen Syndrome (JLNS) is an autosomal re cessive variant of familial long QT syndrome (LQTS). JLNS is caused by ho mozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the KCNQ1 or KCNE1 gene. JLNS is characterized by congenital profound bilateral hearing loss, a long QT interval and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Case ~ The index patient presented with a cardiac arrest at the age of 15 years. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed typical signs of LQTS. The boy was already known by a paediatric neurologist, because of delayed develop ment with a seizure disorder (normal EEG) and an ENT specialist, because of congenital deafness. Two of his brothers were also diagnosed with deafness at birth and seizures at young age. One of them died suddenly at the age of 4. ECG tracing of the other brother showed also signs of LQTS. Genetic testing of both the index patient and his brother showed a com pound heterozygous mutation (c.644dupT and c.1343dupC) in the KCNQ1 gene, which confirm the diagnosis of JLNS. Conclusion ~ The index patient and his brother were deaf since birth and diagnosed at a young age with seizures. One brother died suddenly at an age of 4 and was also deaf since birth. This family was diagnosed with JLNS just after the cardiac arrest of the index patient. The diagnosis JLNS could have been recognised much earlier in this family, because of the typical combina tion of deafness, recurrent collaps and sudden death in this family. E",2016
26612,"Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome (JLNS; MIM 220400) is a rare autoso mal recessive cardioauditory ion channel disorder that affects 1/200000 to 1/1000000 children. It is characterized by congenital profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), a long QT interval, ventricular tachyar rhythmias, and episodes of torsade de pointes on the electrocardiogram. Cardiac symptoms arise mostly in the early childhood and consist of synco pal episodes during periods of stress, exercise, or fright and are associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death. JLNS is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in KCNQ1 on 11p15.5 or KCNE1 on 1q22.1 q22.2. We report on a 10 year old boy with congenital hearing loss, a severely prolonged QT interval who presented with multiple episodes of syncope. His parents are first degree cousins. We performed Sanger sequen cing and identified a novel homozygous variant in KCNQ1 (c.1343dupC, p. Glu449Argfs*14). Both parents were heterozygous carriers of this mutati on. The identification of the genetic substrate in this patient confirmed the clinical diagnosis of JLNS and allowed us to provide appropriate manage ment to the patient and genetic counseling to his family.

26613,"Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze carriers of the Prothrom bin G20210A mutation having thrombotic complications, to identify pati ents with young onset stroke and to find the distribution of this mutation in a random sample of the population. Materials and methods: four cases of patients, who had been hospitalized due to thrombotic complications at the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno Klinikos from 2014 until 2016, were analyzed. A random sample of 475 subjects was studied in the laboratory of Molecular Cardiology of the Institute of Cardiology of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences by using commercial Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems, UK).Results: The 4 patients were carriers of a G20210A heterozygous G/A geno type. None of them carried the FV:Leiden p. R506Q mutation. Three of the represented patients had thromboembolic complications. These three pati ents were males aged 20.4, 36.4 and 45.3 years. One female patient aged 1.4 years had an ischemic stroke. Thus, one of four patients with a prothrom botic state and a G/A genotype had an ischemic stroke. Population analysis revealed that only (n,4) 0.8 % of G/A prothrombin G20210A heterozygotes and (n,1) 0.2 % of A/A homozygotes were present in a random sample of Lithuanias population. Conclusions: Our results show that the Prothrombin G20210A is a very rare mutation in the Lithuanian population. However, results of this study also show that the Prothrombin G20210A mutation might significantly increase the risk of young onset stroke. E P06 Metabolic and mitochondrial disorders E",2016

Thus, there are potential contribution of vitamin D receptor and IL6 polymorphisms to predisposition for chronic periodontitis (CP) or type 2 diabetes melitus (T2DM). Torque teno virus (TTV) produces chronic infec tions and can interfere with IL 6 production and secretion. Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between four ge netic polymorphisms and CP or T2DM in Romanian population. Material and methods. Patients with CP without T2DM (n,150), T2DM with CP (D CP,150) and matched clinically healthy subjects (n,300) were re cruited for this study.

Introduction: Fabry Disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme ÃÂ± galactosidase A. It is an X linked trait caused by a mutation in the GLA gene on Xq22.1. The phenotype/genotype in FD is heterogeneous. FD causes glycolipids to accumulate in the vascular and endothelium. Objective: We present the case of a 3 generation family where five individu als are identified as carriers of a previously unreported heterozygous vari ant of FD in exÃÂ³n 6 of the GLA gene. Case report: The proposita is a 9 month old female, product of non consa guineos parents. At 24 hours of birth, bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage and jaundice appear, remaining in intensive care for breathing difficulties, heart murmur and hypertension. Renal ultrasound: ectasia in left kidney, small right renal artery and right renal hypoplasia. FD Testing: Gene Se quencing GLA heterozygous variant in exon 6 of the GLA gene (c.968C>Gp. P323R). HPLC/Tandem MS lyso Gb3 0.8ng/ml (reference<0,8/ml). Family sequencing studies: 4 members (mother, maternal: aunt, cousin and grand father), with same mutation. Normal Gb3. None of them had F. D. sympto matology. Discussion: In this case only the proposita presents clinical manifestations of FD at birth. There are no reports of infants with these findings. In this variety the genotype/phenotype association appear to be independent fin dings. Conclusions: FD has a high genetic heterogeneity. Molecular studies and genotype phenotype correlation are required to clarify the variability. Fa mily clinical and molecular studies are required to prevent complications and implement enzyme replacement therapy to improve the quality of life if necessary. E",2016
26617,"Fabry disease is an X linked lysosomal storage disorder. Mutations in the GLA gene result in deficient alpha galactosidase A enzyme activity and sub sequent progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL 3) in the vascular endothelium and various body organs. Here we report a novel hemizygous mutation p. Lys240ArgfsX29 in exon 5 of the GLA gene in a 15 year old male who presented with angiokeratomas in the trunk region, pain in the body extremities, gastrointestinal pain and cornea verticillata. Alpha galactosidase A activity was 0.0078mU/mg (nor mal range 0.36 0.84 mU/mg). This mutation was subsequently found in his asymptomatic 45 year old mother. No other family members were found to carry this mutation. Concentration of the biomarker Lyso Gb3 was marked ly increased at 195ng/ml (normal reference <0.9 ng/ml).In view of the clinical phenotype and the very low alpha galactosidase A activity we conclude that this novel mutation is the cause of Fabry disease in this patient.

Diagnostics of autosomal dominant form of FH (ADH) is possible by both routine laboratory tests and family history evaluation. Material and Methods: Analysis of mutation in a gene of a receptor of LDLP DeltaG197 exon 4 in two patients with FH. Results: Patient M., 6 years old, with skin xanthomas in palms, elbow and knee joints, inguinal and popliteal folds. The first elements of xantoma appeared at the age of 4 years old. The patientÃ¢ÂÂs lipidogram showed cholesterol 16mmol/l, triglycerides (TG) 4.5 mmol/l, low density lipoprotein (LDLP) 8.52 mmol/l. The family pedigree revealed early heart attacks in relatives of the 2nd and 3rd degree on the maternal line. His mother had tendinous xanthomas at the age of 29 years old and his father has normal lipid analysis. Mutation in LDLP DeltaG197 4 exon was detected in the child, his mother, and the motherÃ¢ÂÂs side relatives. Patient A., 14 years old.

Isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) is a mito chondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the third step in leucine catabolism. The genetic deficiency of IVD results in an accumulation of isovaleric acid, which is toxic to the central nervous system and leads to isovaleric acidemia. Materials and Methods: In this study, the proband with symptoms of IVA re ferred us. We used the newborn screening for metabolic diseases with GC/MS method that shown an increased significant of C5 organic acid, the result of screening and symptoms of newborn confirmed the Isovaleric acidemia (IVA). Then we evaluated all of the exons and exon intron boundaries of IVD gene with PCR Sequencing method. Results: We identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.326 T>C p. L109P) in exon 4 of IVD gene. The heterozygosity of his parents for the mentioned mutation was confirmed by PCR Sequencing method. There was no report of this mutation in the literature; because this mutation was present in the parents, in heterozygous state, it is very likely to be pathogen.

We have identified a novel L2HGDH gene mutation and three L 2 HGA patients at a family. Case Presentation: A 29 year old man admitted to our clinic with complain of epilepsy and mild intellectual disability. His brain MRI revealed a sym metrical, extensive subcortical white matter lesion and also a cystic lesion at deep white matter. Urine test for organic acids showed a significantly increased level of2 hydroxyglutaric acid and simultaneous plasma lysine amino acid level also was very high. These findings suggest us diagnosis of L 2 HGA. After L2HGDH gene sequence analysis, a homozygous variation, c.738G>A (p. Lys246Lys), in exon 6 reported. The variation has no effect on amino acid residue but its location at the last codon of sixth exon and may alter splicing.

Nuclear gene SURF1 encodes an as sembly factor for cytochrome c oxidase complex and is vital for its function. Autosomal recessive mutations in SURF1 cause approximately one third of COX related LS cases. Patients and Methods: Psychomotor delay, severe hypotonia, hypotrophy, hypoglycemia and elevated blood and CSF lactate were noted in 6 month old boy. Decreased activities of Complex II and IV were witnessed. Never theless, MRI was not pointing to LS at the time. Demyelination of pons, mes encephalon and basal ganglia were observed later at 11 months and rapid progressive deterioration lead to death at the age of 1 year. Blood sample was collected for whole exome sequencing (WES) at the age of 6 months. WES was performed on Complete GenomicÃ¢ÂÂs platform.

Materials and Methods: We diagnosed LOTS in 27 year old female of mixed ethnicity (Russian mother and Tatar father). Enzyme and DNA tests were used. Results: The patient coming from Bashkiria (south east of European Russia adjoining Ural) had typical presentation of adolescence onset, slow pro gressing proximal spinal amyotrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia with cerebel lar atrophy on MRI, subclinical polyneuropathy and normal intelligence. We suspected late onset GM2 gangliosidosis by correspondence 14 years after disease onset. Minding patientÃ¢ÂÂs origin, Sandhoff disease seemed probable, but laboratory findings were those of LOTS: decreased hexosaminidase A level with residual activity 4% and HEXA mutation c.805G>A (p. Gly269Ser). Mutation looked like homozygous, but heterozygosity was found only in fa ther and not in mother which may have several explanations: patientÃ¢ÂÂs fal se homozygosity due to maternal HEXA large deletion (though HEXA large deletions are rare), p. Gly269Ser de novo or germinal mosaicism in mother. The origin of mutation in upper generations of family could not be traced. The mutation in homozygous or compound heterozygous state is common for Ashkenazi LOTS and was also found in few non Ashkenazi LOTS fami lies, mostly with roots matching regions of historical Ashkenazi settlement (Navon et al, 1990; Neudorfer et al, 2005), but not in Turkic populations as in our case.

26626,"Background: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) has many components like waist circumferences and hypertension. Fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) could play important role in their metabolism. The present study tries to examine the relationship between FTO and CETP gene variants and 2 me tabolic syndrome risk factors in affected subjects. Materials and Methods: This association study was conducted in affected MetS 1120 participants in TCGS. Nine different single nucleotide polymor phisms (SNPs) of FTO and CETP genes (rs1121980, rs1421085, rs1558902, rs8050136, rs7202116, rs6499640, rs1864163, rs3764261, rs1800775) were genotyped using Tetra ARMs PCR. All data adjusted by age and smo king status. The association of each SNP with Mets parameters was analyzed by Plink software. Results: Four FTO variants (rs1121980, rs8050136, rs1558902 and rs1421085) were associated with waist circumferences and hypertensi on. Risk alleles of three first SNPs were significantly associated with dia stolic and systolic blood pressure and waist circumferences in the both gender. Strong association were observed in presence of minor allele A at rs8050136 with diastolic and systolic blood pressure and waist circumfe rences (P dbp , 0.007, p sbp , 0.005, p waist , 0.0008). In rs1421085 the C minor allele showed a significant result males (P dbp , 0.005, p sbp , 0.019, p waist , 0.005).Conclusions: A significant interaction between rs8050136 and diastolic and systolic blood pressure as well as waist circumferences was seen. In con clusion, the presence of A allele could be a predictor of high waist circumfe rences and increase blood pressure. E",2016
26627,"Mitochondrial disorders (MD) result from impaired cellular energy meta bolism and encompass a broad range of conditions with variable manife stations including neuromuscular, cardiac, ophthalmic, auditory, endocrine, and renal involvement. These patients are referred to clinical geneticists by any doctor, mainly pediatrician, neurologist or general practitioner, who suspects a MD diagnosis based on clinical grounds. The objective of this work is to standardize the collection of clinical and research data across Lithuania and Latvia. Hence, we developed the survey of disease natural history to help us select a group of patients with clinical mitochondrial syndromes and with suspec ted MD, including respiratory chain deficiency, for a molecular and functio nal study which is a part of the collaborative project. The survey in use was adapted for both countries in 2015 and includes demographics, genealogy, clinical data, results of biochemical, histochemical and genetic investigati ons. Nijmegen mitochondrial disease criteria were also added to this survey (Morava E et al., 2006). The tool will serve as a baseline for data to be obtai ned in 2015 2017. 64 patients were enrolled in 2015. 12.50% of them make up a definite MD group, 73.44% make up a probable MD group and 14.06% are in a possible MD group. Data and biosamples will be accessible to study collaborators and, on request, to other researchers to assist relevant studies.

26629," Introduction: Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease caused by mutations in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, DBT and DLD genes, which encode the E1ÃÂ±, E1ÃÂ², E2 and E3 subunits of the branched chain ÃÂ± keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex, respectively. This com plex is involved in the metabolism of branched chain amino acids. MSUD can be divided into 4 types, depending on the amount of BCKD enzyme activity present in the affected individuals. The most common type of MSUD is the classic form. Materials and Methods: In this study, we analyzed the DNA sequences of BCKDHA gene in an infant who suffered from MSUD and died at the age of 17 days. Quantitative tandem mass spectrometric analysis was used to as sess the levels of branched chain amino acids in plasma. All of the exons and exon intron boundaries of BCKDHA genes were amplified under standard PCR conditions. PCR products were subjected to Sanger sequencing and output files were aligned to the human genome reference and analyzed by Finch TV 1.4 software. Results: Screening of all exons and adjacent introns revealed a homozygous deletion (GTTTTCA(^47)TCTCtGGATGA) as in exon 2of the BCKDHA gene resulting in protein alteration. The heterozygosity of his parents for the mentioned deletion was confirmed by direct sequence analysis of the corre sponding segment. This deletion causes a frame shift alteration. Conclusions: We have identified a novel BCKDHA mutation. This finding can be useful in genetic counseling. Prenatal diagnosis is suggested to investiga te of the fetus in the next pregnancy. E",2016

Besides environment factors, genetic factors may also contribute to the level of phy sical activity and eating behaviours thus effect obesity. Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of various gene mutations on obesity, physical activity levels and eating behaviours. 100 patients and 100 healthy individuals were enrolled to the study. Physical activity levels were measu red with an acceloremeter. Eating behaviours were evaluated using Three Factor Eating questionnaire. The information about other risk factors were also collected. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood. Mutations of MC4R and the region located 2696 to 3275 bp upstream of the MC4R start codon were investigated with PCR and direct sequencing. 6 mutations in FTO, 1 mutation near MC4R and 1 mutation in NMB were investigated with real ti me PCR. Results were evaluated statistically. rs1051168 and rs8050146 mu tations were found statistically significant in patients, rs1121980 was found statistically significant in controls. 16 mutations were found in MC4R of which 14 of them are novel and 8 of them cause amino acid change. 5 muta tions were found near MC4R in which 4 of them are novel. Also it was found that, some obesity related factors and questions of TFEQ are associated with various gene mutations. Any relation between gene mutations and physical activity levels were not detected. Due to the genotype data, physical activity demands and eating behaviours, it may be possible to recommend patients for proper exercise and eating patterns to prevent obesity. E",2016

26633,"Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs) are caused by a defect in peroxisome biogenesis due to mutations in one of 13 PEX genes. Clinical findings are heterogeneous, with the most important features being liver dysfunction, developmental delay and other neurological abnormalities, adrenocortical dysfunction and impairment of hearing and vision. Typically, ZSD patients accumulate very long chain fatty acids, phytanic acid and bile acid interme diates, and have a deficiency of plasmalogens in erythrocytes. Most patients with a PEX3 defect present with a severe form of Zellweger syndrome with death in the first year of life. We present a brother and sister from a consanguineous marriage who are homozygous for a novel pathogenic variant c.206 1G>T in intron 2 of PEX3. The patients are in their twenties and have spastic tetraparesis, nystagmus, visual impairment, leukodystrophy and mental retardation. mRNA studies in patient fibroblasts revealed that the c.206 1G>T substi tution abolishes the normal splice site. This leads to activation of a cryptic acceptor splice site and production of an in frame transcript with a 27bp (9aa) deletion. Biochemical studies revealed normal peroxisomal parameters in blood and fibroblasts, but catalase immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that peroxisomes were enlarged in most cells and in some cells the number of peroxisomes was reduced. Our patients exemplify how a splice site variant predicted to give a severe phenotype can be less severe than expected due to activation of a cryptic splice site. Based on the mRNA studies we propose that the in frame pro duct has residual activity explaining the milder phenotype in our patients. E",2016

This study was conducted to investigate the relation between rs1326634 C>T polymor phism and T2D in a Tehranian population. Materials and methods: Subjects were 603 T2DM and 1100 healthy, chosen from among participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Polymor phism from SLC30A8 gene was genotyped using the Tetra Arms PCR and results were confirmed by direct sequencing. Results: Distributions of genotypes did not differ between cases and con trols. The frequency of CC, CT , and TT genotypes was 29.4, 41.4, and 29.2% respectively, in controls. In the case group, the frequency of CC, CT , and TT was 24.6, 46.2, and 29.2%, respectively. Means of BMI, waist, and hip cir cumference were higher in TT control subjects (P< 0.05). After adjustment for age, sex, and BMI in cases, the probability of high TG decreased by 54% among heterozygote (CT) vs. the homozygote combined group (CC+TT) (95% CI: 0.34 0.85, P,0.009). After splitting by sex and adjustment for age and BMI, in male cases, the probability of high TG was significantly de creased by 47%, among heterozygotes (95% CI: 0.25 0.87, P,0.016).Conclusion: Although we found no association between the rs1326634 poly morphism and T2D, obesity related indices, as risk factors for T2D, showed a significant relationship with TT genotype in controls. Based on these re sults, heterozygosity for T allele predisposes individuals to obesity, the ef fect that may be masked by other factors in diabetic patients. E",2016

Symptoms are related with extreme insolubility of xanthi ne, and include urolithiasis, crystalluria, hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections and renal colic. Two clinically indistinguishable types of classical HX have been described. Type I (XDHD; OMIM#278300) is a simple XDH deficiency due to mutations in XDH gene, whereas Type II (XDH/AO CD; OMIM603592) results from a combined deficiency of XDH and aldehyde oxi dase (AO) caused by mutations in molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) gene, located on chromosome 18q12.2. Only about 150 cases of HX have been reported currently, being the prevalence higher in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Type I appears to predominate. We report a rare case of Type II HX in a female infant from non consanguineous parents. The patient presented hypouricemia and hypouricosuria, as well as higher concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine in urine. Xanthine calculi were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The genetic study was performed by PCR amplification of the XDH and MOCOS genes with specifically designed primers and subsequently Sanger sequencing.

In recent years, interest has been expressed on the susceptibility polymorphisms of T1D. The aim of this study was to define the frequency of the C1858T polymorphisms in the PTPN22 gene, which codes for a protein (Lyp) that may negatively regulate the pro ximal signaling pathway after T cell receptor activation, in a cohort of 113 Caucasian patients (58 male and 55 female) with T1D, and to assess a pos sible link to a group of clinically relevant variables: age at onset, gender, diabetes related autoantibodies, residual ÃÂ² cell function, and daily insulin requirement six months after diagnosis. The C1858T variant (rs2476601) was investigated through PCR RFLP and we found that the frequency of the PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism in the analyzed diabetic patients is 17.7%. A statistically significant correlation between the polymorphism and higher levels of C peptide at diagnosis and lower insulin requirement at six months from diagnosis was seen (p,0.001 and p,0.04).

Introduction: Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are mainly disorders of innate immunity and characterized by unprovoked inflammatory attacks. We studied a consanguineous family with two affected children, with an ini tial diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). While recurrent fe brile attacks with serositis, high acute response and parental origin were consistent with FMF, disease onset before age one year, delay in growth, no mutation in MEFV and poor response to colchicine were not typical features of this disease. Methods: SNP genotype data for all family members were used for multi point linkage analysis. Targeted sequencing was performed for MVK resid ing in one of the linked regions and seven other autoinflammation related genes, IL1RN, LPIN2, MEFV, NLRP12, NLRP3, TNFRSF1A and PSTPIP1. After the identification of the causative mutation, serum IgD and urinary meva lonic acid levels were measured. Results: Linkage analysis detected seven candidate regions. The largest can didate region, at 12q24.11 q24.31 (LOD,1.92), contained 191 genes. Novel homozygous c.481T>C (p. Cys161Arg) mutation in MVK, the gene respon sible for Hyper IgD Syndrome (HIDS) was identified. At the protein level, cysteine at position 161 is totally conserved in mammals. Urinary mevalonic acid was not detected for either patient, and serum IgD level was slightly elevated for only one patient. Conclusions: We identified a novel homozygous MVK mutation in patients with a FMF like disease but without a typical HIDS phenotype. We hypoth esize that this novel mutation underlies the atypical clinical presentation. Phenotypic variability of HIDS is well known, and our findings further ex pand the MVK mutation phenotype.

In this study we present the influence of multiple sclerosis associated regulatory variant rs10877013 on the expression of genes involved in vitamin D activation (CYP27B1), vitamin D receptor (VDR) and vitamin D degradation (CYP24A1) under inflammato ry environment. Materials and Methods: We used lipopolysacharide and interferon gamma activated monocytes from 119 individuals and vitamin D stimulated lym phoblastoid cell lines (LCLs, n,109) of 1000 Genomes to quantify the mRNA expression of vitamin D genes by RTqPCR. Results: The expression level of CYP27B1 was associated with the rs10877013 genotypes (P, 5.0E 6) in activated monocytes. This association between gene expression and variant genotypes was not observed in LCLs. Inversely, rs10877013 genotypes were associated with VDR expression in LCLs (P, 6.0E 4) but it was not in monocytes. Finally, CYP24A1 was highly and specifically induced by active vitamin D (1,25 (OH)2D3) and its expres sion correlated with the expression of VDR in LCLs but no polymorphism was found to be associated with its expression in a search of variants in 1 Mb around its position.

We aimed to determine P268S and M863V polymorphisms in CARD15/NOD2 genes associated with an increased risk of developing UC and CD and to establish correlations between P268S and M863V genotypes in Turkish population. Materials and Methods: This study included 153 healthy controls and 107 patients (42 CD and 65 UC) with CD and UC. The P268S and M863V gene regions were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The results of patient and control group were evaluated statistically. Results: According our results, the P268S CC genotype was prevalent on pa tients and controls (55% vs 67%), followed by genotypes CT (38% vs 27%) and TT (7% vs 6%) in CD. The prevalence of genotypes of CC (wild type), CT (heterozygous mutant) and TT (homozygous mutant) profiles for the P268S polymorphism were 69%, 25% and 6% respectively in UC patients, and 67%, 27% and 6% respectively in healthy control groups. Just two bands of 212 bp and 160 bp were found in wild type M863V in all subjects and no other mutant band (372 bp) of M863V was detected using PCR RFLP frag ment electrophoresis. Conclusions: There are no association P268S and M863V polymorphisms between patients with CD and UC and control groups in Turkish population. E P08 Intellectual Disability E",2016
26645,"LABCO Iberia. Barcelona, Esplugues de Llobregat, Spain. Introduction: A new deletion/duplication syndrome within Xq28 chromo somal band has recently been described caused by nonallelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats (LCRs)intron 22 homologous re gion 1 (int22h1) and 2 (int22h2), in addition to int22h3, within the F8 gene. The duplication has been identified in males with cognitive impairment and females with mild or normal phenotype. The reciprocal deletion is rare. Only few cases have been described in the literature of normal females with ske wed inactivation and at higher risk of miscarriages. We report a case of a girl with global developmental delay and Int22h1/int22h2 mediated Xq28 deletion. Material and methods: ArrayCGH (Cytochip ISCA 8X60K, Bluegnome, Ilumi na) was performed in peripheral blood from a 4 years old girl with global developmental delay. Her mother had clinical history of miscarriages. Chromosome X inactivation studies were performed in peripheral blood using methylation specific PCR of the polymorphic CGG repeat in the pro moter region of the FMR1 gene. Results: The proband was found to have a 450kb Xq28 deletion spanning from 154.1 to 154.5 Mb. The deletion included the F8 [MIM 300841], RAB39B [MIM 300774], CLIC2 [MIM 300138] and VBP1 [MIM 300133] ge nes. Complete skewed X chromosome inactivation pattern was observed.

26646,"Introduction: We described the case of a 9 year old boy with a de novo 10q21.3 q22.1 microdeletion, intellectual disability (ID), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mucocutaneous pigmentation, and juvenile colon polyposis (JCP). Methods and Results: Cytogenetic analyses in the proband and her parents was normal; Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) by CytoScan Optima in the patient revealed a deletion of about 4.41 Mb ([hg19] chr10:68,299,927 72,715,960), while CMA of parental DNA was normal. Although no similar size deletions were reported in DECIPHER databa se, there are several patients with much smaller pure deletions (86.05 to 378.77 Kb) that clustered at CTNNA3 gene (chr10:68,165,545 69,222,108). The most remarkable common feature of these cases was intellectual disa bility, global developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, the analysis of the gene content of the deleted region showed 40 MIM genes; of which only four have been implicated in autosomal dominant diseases. Our patient does not exhibit any clinical data of those conditions. In or der to identify that genes could be involved in the phenotype, we analyzed physiologic roles, functional interactions, and also which those are dosage sensitive. The results pointed to CTNNA3 (607667), LRRTM3 (610869) and SIRT1 (604479); all located in 10q21.3, as best candidates. Thus, these three genes may either individually or in combination be responsible for ID with JCP seen in our patient. Conclusions: To the best knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo 10q21.3 q22.1 deletion. This case suggests a novel geno mic disorder at 10q21.3 region associated to ID with JCP . E",2016
26647,"Introduction: Deletion of 12q telomere is rare and few cases with different breakpoints and clinical features have been described in literature so far. Materials and methods: We have studied by means of oligo array CGH (Com parative Genomic Hybridization) two cases with this rearrangement: a 12 years old female patient and a 13 years old male patient both with intellec tual disability, behavioral disorder, and obesity. Results: We have detected two microdeletions in the 12q24.33 chromoso me region, 3.4 Mb and 1.4 Mb in size respectively, involving many common genes that may contribute to the clinical picture of the patients. These mi crodeletions partially overlap with deletions of other patients described in DECIPHER (DatabasE of genomiC varIation and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources; https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/) and previously pu blished in literature with intellectual disability, kidney disease and problem of development of genitals. We have observed the presence of a minimum deleted region (660 Kb), located in the 12q subtelomeric segment including the P2RX2 gene, which has been previously proposed as a candidate gene for intellectual disability. In fact, behavioral disorder and mild mental retar dation were common to all the patients. Larger deletions extended up to the proximal regions (3 9 Mb) containing the STX2 and NCOR2 genes, seem to be involved in urinary genital apparatus and connective tissue anomalies. Conclusion: The comparison between our patients and the other ones alrea dy described has allowed us to link the size of deleted region to the clinical features. E",2016
26648,"Introduction: 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome has a wide spectrum of clinical features, including intellectual disability, absent/very poor speech, dysmorphism and microcephaly. This clinical diversity is partly a conse quence of deletion size, which ranges from 245kb to 4.4Mb. Thus, it is sugge sted that two or more microdeletion syndromes may exist within this region and a genotype phenotype correlation has yet to emerge. Here we discuss the genetic and clinical features observed in a patient with a small 17p13.1 deletion. We focus on microcephaly, a prominent feature of this syndrome. Material and Methods: We report a 4 year old boy referred to aCGH testing presenting with global psychomotor delay, facial dysmorphisms and micro cephaly. Family history was unremarkable. Samples were studied by aCGH (NimbleGen CGX 135K, Perkin Elmer). Genomic analysis was performed with Genoglyphix v3.0 software (Signature Genomics). Results: aCGH re vealed a de novo microdeletion of 287.53kb in the 17p13.1 region (hg19; chr17:7,119,830 7,407,357) containing 23 OMIM genes. Overlapping our deletion with the previously reported 17p13.1 microdeletions, we identified a new minimal region of 92kb for microcephaly. Conclusions: The pheno type observed in our patient is consistent with the 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome. Previously reported patients with 17p13.1 deletions pointed to an overlapping region associated with microcephaly, including four genes, ASGR1, ACADVL, DVL2 and GABARAP . Considering the presence of microce phaly in our patient and the lack of ASGR1 gene in the deleted segment, we propose to exclude this gene as a candidate for this feature. These findings contribute to narrow the 17p13.1 critical genomic region associated with microcephaly. E",2016
26649,"Introduction: 1q44 terminal microdeletion has emerged as a clinically re cognizable syndrome. Phenotypic presentation, although heterogeneous, includes moderate to severe developmental delay (DD)/intellectual disabi lity (ID), microcephaly and seizures. Corpus callosum abnormalities are also commonly observed, but attempts at defining its critical region have yielded inconsistent results to date. Small size interstitial deletions within 1q44 lo cus are rare and help to appoint candidate genes for this particular trait. Materials and Methods: We describe a 12 year old girl referred for array CGH testing due to moderate DD/ID. At physical examination, she presented short stature, craniofacial dysmorphisms including bifid uvula, convergent strabismus, bilateral ankle valgus deformity and pes planus; head circumfe rence was normal. Brain MRI revealed corpus callosum hypoplasia. She had been diagnosed with absence epilepsy at 11.Results: A de novo 314 Kb deletion in 1q44 terminal region was detected by arrayCGH (CGX HD 180K, Signature Genomics/Perkin Elmer), inclu ding the FAM36A, HNRNP and EFCAB2 genes (HG19 Chr1:244,961,796 245,276,463).Discussion/Conclusions: Except for the absence of microcephaly, this pati ent has a full 1q44 microdeletion phenotype. Selmer KK et al. reported a boy with a 163 kb deletion in 1q44 involving the FAM36A and HNRNPU genes, who also had moderate DD/ID, absence seizures, thin corpus callosum and normal head circumference. This case reinforces FAM36A and HNRNPU as good candidate genes for 1q44 microdeletion features, namely corpus callo sum abnormalities. Functional studies are needed to clarify the role of these genes in brain development. E",2016

ORG 437Back to index Context: Submicroscopic chromosomal gains and losses are responsible for intellectual disability (ID) and dysmorphic features that affects about 3% of the population. The distal portion of the short arm of the human X chromo some (Xp22) is a region that undergoes frequent genomic rearrangements. Objective: Our goal is to compile case reports of submicroscopic gains and losses located at Xp22 region that were undetectable by routine cytogenetic analysis while reliable detection was feasible by array CGH. Methods: Samp les from 14 subjects anonymized (5 unrelated), collected at Hospital Carlos Haya, were ascertained in Bioarray as having Xp22 gains/losses. Five unre lated patients presented ID and dysmorphism suspicious of an underlying chromosome abnormality not confirmed by karyotyping. Agilent 60K Oli gonucleotide array CGH platform based on the construction of the hg19 ge nome sequence was used in order to detect such gains/losses. Results: Five unrelated cases carried copy number variations ranging in size from Ã¢ÂÂ¼0.126 to Ã¢ÂÂ¼1.6 Mb. Two subjects showed duplications of maternal origin (microdu plication at Xp22.31) and three had submicroscopic changes of unknown origin, as parental testing of origin was not performed (microdeletions at Xp22.33 and Xp22.32, and microduplication at Xp22.33). DLRS value that calculates the probe to probe log ratio noise of arrays was <0.2 in all the ca ses, which means a precise detection of very small aberrations. Conclusions: Our data confirm that Agilent 60K array CGH can accurately detect microdu plications and microdeletions at Xp22 region.

Genomic microarrays are used as first tier genetic tests in postnatal assessment of subjects diagnosed with unexplained global development delay (GDD)/ intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) in almost all West European countries. Two years ago, we started to imple ment in South West Romania the postnatal aCGH assessment of individuals with unexplained GDD/ID or CMA. Materials and methods: We assessed 30 patients diagnosed with unex plained GDD/ID or CMA. Conventional cytogenetic evaluation did not de tect any chromosomal imbalance that could be associated with the clinical phenotype of the patients. DNA isolated and purified from peripheral blood was examined for copy number variations (CNVs) using Roche NimbleGen 3x720K/12x135K or Agilent 4x180K/ 8x60K ISCA design oligonucleotide microarray. Copy number data was analyzed with Nexus 6.1 software (Ne xus BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA).Results: aCGH assessment identified in several patients submicroscopic changes (microdeletions or microduplications) that could partially explain the clinical phenotype.

Case Report: Four year old boy had development delay, hypogenita lism, obesity and poor visual acuity. He was born with polydactyly for which he had surgery at 10 month old. He also presented polycystic kidney disea se, RP and hypospadias. No family history was reported. A Bardet Biedl syn drome was suggested at Hospital Carlos Haya. Objective: Genetics study by CGH+SNP microarrays and whole exome sequencing to identify pathogenic BBS related variants. Methods: Blood samples from boy and both parents were ascertained in Bioarray. Firstly, 129 BBS related mutations were stu died by Agilent Custom CGH+SNP microarray. Both Agilent 60K and 400K array CGH were performed to detect microduplications/microdeletions. Finally, a whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000) was carried out. Results: A total of 115/129 BBS related mutations analyzed were excluded; 14 of them, in BBS1 gene, got no signal. Array CGH 60K detected a microde letion that affects one probe in BBS1 so size cannot be determined due to its low density. No loss of heterozygosity was shown by CGH+SNP Microarray. Results from array CGH (400K) determined a 11q13.2 homozygous micro deletion in the boy that affects BBS1 (0.011 Mb). Also, heterozygous deleti ons in both of the asymptomatic parents were found.

FGD1 protein is an impor tant regulator of events that control extracellular matrix remodeling, bone development, cell migration and also involved in the regulation of few secre tory proteins. Recent studies suggest that non coding variants are equally important for disease progression. Current study tests manifestations of intronic variant SNP rs2239809 of FGD1 in intellectually disabled children. Materials and Methods: The prediction of associated intronic variants of FGD1 gene was performed using GWAS (Genome Wide Association Study) central database and GWAS 3D web server. PCR RFLP was performed for screening of selected intronic variants. Sanger sequencing was used to vali date single nucleotide change in FGD1 gene. Clinical features were studied and compared; partial pedigree was recorded for selected patients. Results: The significant alteration was found in two affected children from different family harboring intronic variant c.659+27T>C (rs2239809) at in tron 3 of FGD1 gene. Surprisingly, female and male showed different pheno typic appearance for same variation. Atypical X linked inheritance pattern was observed in case of female patient.

His speech regressed at 18 months of age and started to improve again since 5 years of age. However, expressive speech is severely affected and shows no progress. The boy is hyperactive and anxious. Other features include hypotonia, mild facial dysmorphism, hypermetropia and strabismus. Karyotyping and microarray analysis yielded no findings. Targeted next ge neration sequencing using the TruSight Autism panel (Illumina) identified a private heterozygous nonsense FOXP1 mutation (NM_032682.5:c.1319C>G,p.

The aberrant transcript is likely removed by nonsense mediated decay (NMD), and FOXP1 haploin sufficiency was proposed as the main pathogenic mechanism. If the tran script escaped NMD, the p. S440* mutation would truncate FOXP1 between the leucine zipper dimerization domain and the FOX DNA binding domain. A recently functionally characterized neighbouring FOXP1 variant p.

The phenotype in the heterozygous carrier mother was normal. The phenotype and genotype of her biological father was unknown. Conclusion: Microcephaly may be part of many genetic malformation syn dromes or may result from a variety of intrauterine factors. More specific and accurate diagnosis with molecular confirmation may provide a possibi lity of more focused health supervision, which could be essential for patient and genetic counselling in prenatal diagnosis of parents.

26663,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are life long impairing conditions, with high impact on the patient and family. Genetic and environmental fac tors are known contributors to human development and behavior. Thus, revealing the underlying genetic causes of these conditions is of great im portance both in clinical practice and research. We report on our experience with array CGH (Agilent Technnologies plat form) in NDDs investigation. 140 patients, aged 2 months to 18 years were referred to our laboratory for genetic testing with intellectual disability and other clinical features (dysmorphism, congenital malformations, autism or other behavior problems, speech delay). Array CGH findings were confir med by FISH and qPCR tests, and parental studies were performed when necessary. Pathological CNVs were detected in 30 patients, preferentially involving the following chromosomes: 4 (5 patients), 22 (5 patients), X (3 boys and one girl with XY karyotype and sex reversal due to DAX duplication), 9 and 3 (each, 3 patients).Besides well described syndromic regions (e.g. Wolf Hirschorn, Cri du chat, Mowat Wilson, Smith Magenis, 22q11.2 deletion, Phelan McDermid, MECP2 duplication syndromes), other genomic regions, rarely reported in patients with NDDs, were either deleted or duplicated in our cohort. Among these regions, 1q21.3 q22, 3p26.3, 9p24.3 24.1, 9q34.1 harbour candidate genes for NDDs and have the potential to define new clinical entities. Our data illustrates the utility of array CGH in the investigation of patients with intellectual disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Well described CNVs, both molecularly and clinically, contribute to better defi ning new genomic regions involved in the pathogenesis of NDDs. Acknowledgments: National Project PN 92.033.02.03.

26664,"IntroductionThe 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, also known as Phelan McDermid syndro me (PMS), is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide range of deletion sizes (100 Kb to 9 Mb), and a great phenotypic variability. Most neurologi cal features are thought to be caused by haploinsuficiency of SHANK3 gene, which encodes for a core scaffolding protein at the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. The present study aimed to detect deletions affec ting only to the SHANK3 gene (<100 Kb) so that a better genotype pheno type correlation can be achieved in patients with PMS. Materials and MethodsArray CGH including 15kb resolution for SHANK3 gene (KaryoNIMÃÂ® Au tism 180K array CGH, designed by NIMGeneticsÃÂ®) has been used for ana lyzing patients suspected to bear PMS. Data analysis was done using hg19 genomic build and ADM 2 statistic (set as 6).ResultsWe identified 8 individuals with 22q13.33 deletions, but only three of them were selected since they harboured pure SHANK3 deletions. Specifically, pa tient 1 and 2 showed a 50 60 Kb deletion affecting exons 10 to 23 and 4 to 23, respectively. On the other hand, patient 3 showed the smallest deletion, being 23 Kb sized and affecting exons 8 to 17. The three patients were dia gnosed with developmental delay and/or intellectual disability. In addition, patient 1 and 3 also showed autism spectrum disorder. ConclusionsThese results supports haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene, which en codes for a structural protein of the postsynaptic density, as a major cau sative factor in the neurological symptoms observed in Phelan McDermid syndrome.

The syndrome is characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disa bility, poor expressive speech, mild dysmorphic facial features, hypotonia, skeletal abnormalities, strabismus, behaviour abnormalities, and variable other anomalies. While eleven patients with likely causal deletions invol ving only SOX5 gene have already been reported in the literature, the causal role of SOX5 sequence variants is unclear with only one such variant being described in detail (Nesbitt et al., 2015).We describe two patients with de novo variants in SOX5 identified by whole exome sequencing: one consensus splice site variant and the other predic ted pathogenic missense variant with evaluation of structural consequences by in silico protein modelling in progress. The patient with a splice site vari ant presented with global developmental delay, hypotonia, strabismus, and scoliosis, which correlates well with the previously described SOX5 asso ciated phenotype. The patient with a missense variant had a more severe clinical course and presented with microcephaly, failure to thrive, seizures, and severe global developmental delay. No aggressive behaviour was noted in either patient. Both patients had hypoplasic corpus callosum. In summary, these cases highlight the utility of exome sequencing in pati ents with genetically heterogeneous and non specific disorders such as hypotonia, developmental delay and intellectual disability (ID) and suggest that patients with SOX5 related ID might be underdiagnosed.

All the patients were under treatment with atypical antipsychotics (Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Olanza pine). Body Mass Index was recorded for different time points and fasting blood samples were taken to measure insulinemia. 5 HTR2C 759C/T poly morphism identification was carried out. From the study group, 22 patients presented the 759C/T polymorphism in 5 HT2C gene and we identified 2 lots based on their specific genotype: the first lot included patients with C/CC genotype and the second lot included patients with T/CT genotype. No significant statistical difference in changes of BMI from baseline to different endpoints was found between the 2 lots. A significant statistic difference (p,0.035) between the lots identified based on genotype was found for insulinemia after 18 months of treatment.

Results: The frequencies of each SNP in the Korean pregnant women (n,534) were DRD4 521T>C 0.47 and COMT +186C>T 0.30, +1158C>G 0.30 and +1222G>A 0.32. No polymorphisms were found in the DRD4 +2526T>G gene. There was no genetic association between the DRD4 and COMT gene polymorphisms and fear during childbirth. Conclusion: The results of this study show that these genes (DRD4, COMT) are less likely have an effect on the fear during childbirth. In order to under stand the fear during childbirth, further studies will have to be focused on comprehensive research of the social, psychological, environmental factors and the interaction of the connected genes.

26683," Introduction: Tobacco smoking is one of the major risk factors for a num ber of chronic diseases and is the leading cause of preventable death in the world. Many genetic studies have been conducted to identify genetic vari ants for smoking behavior. The most widely replicated region is the nicoti nic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes (CHRNA5 A3 B4) on chromosome 15q25. As most of the published genetic studies of smoking behavior were primarily European Americans or of European origin, it is of tremendous interest to elucidate if these gene variants play any role in the etiologies of smoking behavior in Chinese population in Taiwan. Methods: We recruited 485 current smokers, 370 ex smokers, and 1202 non smokers, respectively, from the Healthcare Center in a Medical Center. We selected 6 SNPs on CHRNA5 (rs680244, rs16969968, rs518425) and CHRNA3 (rs578776, rs3743078, rs1051730) for genotyping. Results: For male subjects, we found the CHRNA5 rs518425, the CHRNA3 (rs578776, rs3743078) contributed to the increase of smoking quantities by at least 4 cigarettes per day (CPD). Besides, we observed that CHRNA5 rs680244, and CHRNA3 (rs578776, rs3743078) were associated with heavy smoking among female smokers. We also found that CHRNA5 rs680244, and CHRNA3 (rs578776, rs3743078) were related to increase the quantities of smoking by 3 to 4 CPD. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that several distinct SNPs on the CHR NA3/CHRNA5 genes were associated with smoking quantities for different gender. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the associa tion between CHRNA3/CHRNA5 gene variations and smoking quantities in Chinese population.

26684,"Introduction: Dosage sensitivity of the CHRNA7 gene, which encodes the ÃÂ±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the human brain, is known to have a major contribution to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and intellectual disability (ID). CHRNA7 is included in the smallest region of overlap of the 15q13.3 deletions and duplications, a hotspot for Copy number variants (CNVs) due to the presence of segmental duplications, favoring non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) occurrence. Heterozygous or homozygous deletions are usually associated with a neurodevelopmental phenotype of high pene trance. Case Report: Using exome sequencing after negative extensive genetic work up in a 13 year old Caucasian boy presenting with ASD, intellectual disabili ty and developmental delay, with no facial dysmorphism or malformations, and normal growth, we identified two heterozygous missense mutations in the CHRNA7 gene. The first one, p. Ala124Thr in exon 5 was inherited from his asymptomatic father, and the second one p. Tyr233Cys in exon 7, occur red de novo. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of ASD in a boy with double heterozygous missense variants in CHRNA7 . Given the interest to wards this gene in neuropsychiatric disorders, and the interest in the ge netic dissection of ASDs, international data sharing will be of importance in order to determine if missense mutations could be responsible for neurode velopmental phenotypes.

26685,"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder, and its extreme heterogeneity further complicates our understanding of its biology. Epidemiological evidence from family and twin studies supports a strong genetic component in ASD etiology. Oxidative stress and abnormal DNA me thylation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. Brain tissues from ASD cases showed higher levels of oxidative stress biomarkers than healthy controls in postmortem analysis. Association between oxidative stress and DNA damage has been well known. Thus, we sought to investiga te a potential link between DNA repair genes and ASD and analyze the role of XPD Asp312Asn and XRCC4 G 1394T gene polymorphisms for ASD in the Turkish population. Material and Methods: Genotyping was conducted by PCR RFLP based on 100 patients and 96 unrelated healthy controls. Results: We, for the first time, demonstrated a positive association between XRCC4 gene variants and ASD risk. Frequencies of XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotypes were higher in patients (%34) than the controls (%18.7). The statistical analysis revealed that the individuals who had XRCC4 1394 T/G+G/G genotype had an increased risk for ASD (OR , 2.23, 95% CI , 1.10 4.55). However, no significant association was found for XPD Asp312Asn polymorphism with the risk of ASD. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that XRCC4 G 1394T polymorphism might be associated with ASD pathogenesis. E",2016
26686,"The field of epilepsy genetics has been constantly evolving. Next Generation Sequencing techniques, such as whole exome sequencing (WES) or targe ted panels significantly facilitated the identification of underlying genetic causes of these genetically heterogeneous disorders. Multiple studies have shown that de novo mutations play an important role in early onset severe epilepsy representing the vast majority of pathogenic causative variants in this disease. In this study we address the distribution of de novo mutations in published as well as unpublished cohorts of patients with early onset se vere epilepsy. We study de novo mutations derived from WES trios of epi lepsy patients and compare them with de novo mutations in healthy control cohorts. With this analysis we aim to identify the most commonly affected genes and mutational spectra in early onset severe epilepsy. Further, we in tend to generate confirming or refuting evidence on genes with yet uncer tain or questionable association to epilepsy.

26687,"Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders and is characterized by a postural or motion tremor of a body part, primarily the upper limbs. Despite a strong genetic basis for an inherited predisposition to the development of ET , genetic factors are still poorly understood. Many studies have identified ET susceptibility loci, but genetic and phenotypic he terogeneity observed across individuals make the identification of definitive causative gene difficult. Only mutations the FUS gene has been identified as a highly penetrant and causative for familial ET . However, such mutations seem to explain only a small fraction of all ET cases. We hypothesise that other rare genetic variants cause or predispose to ET . To achieve this goal, we used high throughput DNA sequencing to capture the sequence the pro tein coding portion of the genome (exome) of 16 affected individuals from four large families with an apparent autosomal dominant transmission of the disease. By focusing on rare variants in a familial cohort, we hope to explain a significant portion of the missing heritability in ET , as well as to narrow our current insight on the key biochemical pathways implicated in this complex disorder. Moreover, our findings might lead to the development of new diagnostic tests, which will help physicians make a more accurate diagnosis. [CIHR Foundation Scheme# RN254517 332736] E",2016

26689,"Introduction: Cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs) are an important cau se of stroke, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders among the elderly. Usually CSVD is sporadic, but early onset monogenic forms of CSVD have been reported. CADASIL is one of the most common hereditary CSVD caused by autosomal dominant NOTCH3 gene mutations, while CARASIL is a rare autosomal recessive CSVD caused by HTRA1 gene mutations. More than 200 mutations are known in NOTCH3 gene and only 12 HTRA1 mutated CARA SIL families have been reported so far. Recently, heterozygous HTRA1 mutations have been described associated with an autosomal dominant form of CSVD with reduced penetrance, sho wing clinical features differing from those of CARASIL. Patients and methods: We report a family with three affected individuals, referred for stroke and cognitive impairment segregating as an autosomal dominant disorder. Mutations in NOTCH3 and HTRA1 genes have been screened by Sanger sequencing. In silico prediction tools PolyPhen and SIFT have been used to predict the pathogenicity of the variants found. Skin bio psy of one patient was examined with transmission electron microscope. Results: A heterozygous HTRA1 missense mutation segregating with the di sease and predicted to be deleterious has been found. The mutation affects a highly conserved aminoacid, which, if mutated, strongly reduce the HTRA1 proteolytic activity. The biopsy showed deposits of osmophilic material in the arterial wall, very similar to those characterizing CADASIL. Conclusions: We confirm the dominant inheritance of some HTRA1 mutati ons, overlapping clinical, MRI and ultramicroscopic features of CADASIL, in absence of the typical CARASIL extra neurological symptoms.

26690,"Introduction: CAG repeat expansion in HTT gene is found nearly in 99% of clinically diagnosed Huntington Disease (HD) patients. However, in our rou tine genetic services, we observe this mutation in only approximately two thirds of patients suggesting a greater contribution of genetic heterogeneity. Since TBP gene repeat expansion responsible from SCA17 is the most fre quent mutation found in patients with HD phenotype, we investigated TBP mutation in this patient group. Materials and Methods: Archival DNA samples of 68 patients with HD phe notype without HTT expansion were included in this study. TBP gene CAG/CAA repeat sizes were investigated by polymerase chain reaction followed by fragment analysis on ABI3130 Genetic Analyzer. Results: In this patient group, CAG/CAA repeat expansions of TBP gene were all found to be in normal range (below 40).Conclusion: Determining genetic basis of patients with HD phenotype is cli nically important for both of differential diagnosis and genetic counselling. On the other hand, due to its extremely low frequency in this group of pati ents, testing for TBP CAG/CAA repeat expansion in routine genetic analysis may be considered on a case by case basis.

26691,"Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurode generative disease characterized by motor (tremor, rigidity, postural insta bility, bradi/akinesia etc.) and non motor features (cognitive impairment, memory, psychiatric and personality disorders) resulting by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra. Monoamine oxi dase B (MAOB) and catechol O methyltransferase (COMT) genes are asso ciated with pathogenesis of the neurocognitive impairment. The Val158Met (rs4680, G>A) polymorphism in COMT and intron variant c.1348 36T>C (rs1799836, T>C) in MAOB gene have been associated with various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies show that they are implicated in cognitive impairment and different neuro psychiatric features. Materials and methods: In this study 148 patients with PD and 108 healthy controls, matched to the patients by age, gender and ethnicity (NC) were in cluded. Different genotypes were determined using TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems). Statistical analysis was done using Plink toolset and chi square test. Results and discussion: The Val158Met and c.1348 36T>C polymorphisms did not show significant difference in allele frequency distribution between the PD and NC group. The common Val158 allele and the 158Met allele were with almost equal allele frequencies (P, 0.26, OR, 0.82). The same trend was observed with c.1348 36T>C variant almost equal allele frequencies (P, 0.31, OR, 0.31). Conclusions: Our findings showed no association of Val158Met and c.1348 36T>C with Bulgarian PD patients. However, the limited power of the samp le warrants further research in enlarged cohorts.

Genotyping investigations have failed to firmly implicate particular ge notypes as significant risk conferrers. Here, we aimed to study the associa tion of promoter CGIs methylation with the incidence and sub phenotypes of psychosis. In our study, we recruited patients suffering from schizoaffective (SZA), psychotic bipolar I disorder (BID) or substance induced psychosis (n,42). In order to deconstruct psychosis to sub phenotypes we used v4.0 Basic Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Also, we measured the levels of promoter methylation using Methylation Specific High Resolution Melt analysis (MS HRM) and MethylLight chemistries. Contrary to previous reports, our results failed to show association between increased DTNBP1 promoter methylation and psychotic bipolar I and schi zoaffective disorders. However, compared to SZA and BID cases and normal group, substance induced psychosis showed more than two fold increase of promoter CGI methylation of DTNBP1 which survived multiple comparison (p<0.01). Moreover, these patients scored higher on BPRS in total and on certain sub phenotypes. Despite occasional use of other substances, methamphetamine was the main reported substance of abuse in our series of cases. Previously, me thamphetamine related psychosis has been shown to be associated with certain genotypes of dysbindin. Therefore, despite our small sample size, previous findings in this field, in addition to the significant CGI methylation increase which we observed warrant further investigation on DTNBP1 epi mutations as potential biomarkers in methamphetamine induced psychosis.

26694,"Both autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ) are highly prevalent cognitive disorders, entailing language deficits. Recent advances in genome wide technologies have provided with a long list of candidate genes for SZ and ASD, but the gap between genes, the pathophysiology of SZ and ASD, and their distinctive cognitive and linguistic profiles still remains open. Our study aims to bridge this gap through an evo devo approach that focuses on how language evolved in the species and that construes both con ditions as poles of a continuum of modes of cognition, also encompassing typically developing cognition. To this aim, we have performed literature mining and network analysis of known candidate genes for SZ and ASD and found that they are overrepresented among the gene believed to be impor tant for the evolution of the human faculty of language. Many of these genes are common risk factors for both conditions. Additionally, we performed in silico data mining of previously published SZ and ASD microarray data sets and found that many of these genes important for language evolution (like CNTNAP2, DLX5, FOXP1, or ROBO2) are differentially expressed in the brains of schizophrenics and autists. We will conclude that the (substanti ally opposite) linguistic (dys)abilities seen in SZ and ASD patients may re present abnormal (but still related) ontogenetic itineraries for the human faculty of language and that the same factors that prompted the transition from an ape like cognition to a human specific cognition may explain the high prevalence of SZ and ASD, but also their related cognitive profiles.

26695,"Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an untreatable neuro degenerative disease characterized by neuronal loss and degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons. Patients generally have a pure ALS phenotype, with degeneration affecting mainly neurons of the motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Affected individuals usually die of respiratory failure within 3 5 years of disease progression. Approximately 5 10 % of pa tients with ALS have an inherited form of the disease, nevertheless the diffe rence between hereditary and sporadic ALS seems to be artificial. Therefore, genetic factors play a key role in all types of ALS. Our objective was to screen the variation of 3 candidate genes in Hungarian patients with ALS. Materials and methods: DNA from the patients was extracted from peri pheral blood using standard protocols. Using targeted high throughput se quencing, we screened mutations in the FUS, SETX and C9orf72 genes in 28 Hungarian patients with ALS. Results: Genetic analysis revealed a putative novel mutation in exon 7 of the SETX gene at position 791 where an A to G (c.791A/G) substitution was identified, resulting in an asparagine to serine amino acid exchange (N264S). The detected missense mutation is localized in the amino terminal domain of the senataxin protein, which has a critical function in protein protein interaction. In silico analyses suggested that the identified variation might be a pathogenic mutation.

Mother with severe ce rebellar involvement and behavioral disorders. In addition, a grandmother with neurological disease of unknown origin of later onset. Possible unstab le CAG triplet expansions located in said region encoding genes associated with the development of spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal dominant inhe ritance were determined by Triplet repeated Primed PCR (Genetic study: Labgenetics S. L. Madrid) Results: The patient had a pathological expansion of 45 CAG repeats in the coding region of the ATXN2 gene. There is an inverse relationship between the number of CAG repeats and the age at which the disease. Appropriate ge netic counseling was performed and her mother was studied with 53 years (41 CAG repeats; mutated allele with complete penetrance). Cerebellar ata xia has an autosomal dominant inheritance, in which patients with this di sease usually have an affected parent.

Myotonia congenita (MC) is an inherited myotonia due to mutations in the CLCN1 gene encoding the skeletal muscle ClC 1 chloride channel. Loss of function mutations of ClC 1 channel reduce the sarcolemmal chloride conductance, which, in turn, increases sarcolemma excitability and causes a delayed relaxation manifesting as a clinical and electrical myotonia. Both dominant and recessive inheritance patterns are found in MC families. Bek ker myotonia congenita, the recessive form, is typically more severe and has an earlier onset than the dominant one, Thomsen myotonia congenita (TMC). TMC often has a wider range of presentations, including subclinical to moderately severe forms.

Structural chromosomal aberrations can result in genetic disease due to trisomy and/or monosomy of chromosomal segments. Chromosome 14 is often involved in chromosome rearrangements. Indivi dual cases of partial trisomy 14q have been previously reported in the litera ture, in many instances resulting from parental translocations or pericentric inversions. Cases of partial trisomy 14q with a duplication of 14q31 >qter are rare and present only minor anomalies of dysmorphic features, promi nent nasal, growth retardation and moderate mental retardationHere, we present the case of a boy of 2y7mo that was clinically assessed with facial dysmorphism, anomalies of the members, axial hypotonia and psy chomotor delay. After karyotype analysis, we determined that the patient has a partial trisomy for the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q31 >qter), confirmed by aCGH. The chromosomal abnormalities resul ted from a paternal balanced translocation involving chromosomes 14 and 15 [46,XY, t(14;15)(q31;q26)], a rearrangement also found for the brother of the proband. The inheritance and identity of the identified translocation was ascertained by extensive familial cytogenetic, FISH and aCGH studies.

26704,"The 19q13.11 microdeletion syndrome (MIM 613026) is a clinically reco gnizable condition that recently has been identified by using microarray for genome wide screening. We report a 9 year old male patient with 3,7Mb deletion on 19q13.11 including the critical and minimal overlapping region (MOR) and compare our findings with those cases reported in the literature. The present patient shares several main features with the previously repor ted patients with 19q13.11 microdeletion syndrome including intrauterine/postnatal growth retardation and microcephaly, facial dimorphism, speech disturbance, developmental delay, hypospadias, and ectodermal dysplasia with cutis aplasia in midline scalp. In addition, brain abnormalities and ec trodactyly in hands and feet were confirmed. First diagnostic hypothesis was ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia clefting (EEC) syndrome. The MOR encompass four zinc finger (ZNF) genes (ZNF302, ZNF181, ZNF599, ZNF30). As these ZNF act as transcription factors in brain differen tiation, the haploinsufficiency of part of ZNF cluster set may be involved in the development of cognitive functions of that syndrome. Proximal to the MOR, UBA2 belongs to a protein complex with acetylation activity and seve ral transcription factors, hormone receptors, and signaling proteins related to brain and sexual development are regulated by this post translational modification could contribute to the clinical characteristics observed in pa tients. In conclusion, we reported an additional patient affected by 19q13 microde letion syndrome, whose characteristics may contribute to reinforce the mi nimal region associated and to focus on a few genes potentially responsible for the phenotype. In addition, we suggested that suspected cases of EEC syndrome could be tested to 19q13.11 microdeletion. E",2016
26705,"Introduction: Sotos syndrome (SoS) is an autosomal dominant overgrow th syndrome characterised by a distinctive facial dysmorphism, macroce phaly, variable delays in cognitive and motor development, and advanced bone age. Most cases of SoS are caused by intragenic mutations of the NSD1 gene or 5q35 microdeletions. The clinical presentation is independent of the underlying NSD1 defect, although patients with microdeletions had less prominent overgrowth and more severe learning disability than cases with mutations. Materials and Methods: The patient, a one year old boy, was referred to ge netic evaluation because of the developmental delay. He was born at term after complicated pregnancy. Birth weight was 3900 g and length was 52 cm. Physical examination revealed: dolichocephaly, prominent forehead, hyper telorism, down slanted palpebral fissures and elongated face. His weight, height and head circumference were in normal range The abdominal ultra sonography revealed a malrotated right kidney. The genome profiling of the proband was carried out by oligo array CGH. Agilent ISCA, 4x44, v2.0, with 35 kbp backbone resolution were used. The slides were scanned on Agilent fluorescent scanner G2505C and analyzed by BlueFuse Multi, v 4.2. (20289) (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Results: The oligo array CGH for the patient revealed deletion of 5q35 region (5q35.2 5q35.3). The deletion was 1.66 Mb in size and encompassing NSD1 gene. The array CGH results were confirmed by MLPA. Conclusions: Point mutations in NSD1 are common in Caucasian patients with SoS while submicroscopic deletions at 5q35 occur in approximately 10%. The present report will contribute to further understanding of geno type phenotype correlation in Sotos syndrome. E",2016

26709,"Introduction: Mutations in the BCL6 Corepressor (BCOR) gene, located on Xp11.4, are linked to OculoFacioCardioDental syndrome (OFCD, MIM 300166). It affects both male and female patients and ophthalmological symptoms are often predominant. Materials and Methods: Exome sequen cing was performed in a boy of Caucasian, non consanguineous and healthy parents. He has one younger healthy sib. Intrauterine growth retardation was observed from 32 weeks of gestation on and he was born at 40 weeks with a weight of 2485 g and length of 46 cm. Severe pulmonary hyperten sion made ECMO necessary in the neonatal period. The child has delayed psychomotor development and attends a special school. At the age of 4 years, he still needs tube feeding because of severe feeding difficulties. Car diac ultrasound shows a persistent ductus arteriosus and ophthalmological examination reveals mild microcornea. Facial gestalt is characterized by small palpebral fissures, synophris, bilateral epicanthic folds, small ears, thin upper lip and widely spaced small teeth. Pro and supination are limi ted due to radio ulnar synostosis. Hypospadias and cryptorchidism are pre sent. Results and conclusions: Exome sequencing showed the presence of a hemizygous variant, c.5000C>T , p. Ser1667Leu in the BCOR gene (RefSeq: NM_001123385.1). This alteration of a highly conserved amino acid is pre dicted to be pathogenic (SIFT score 0.01, MutationTaster score 1, PolyPhen score 1.000). This change has not been detected in dbSNP , and ExAC shows a very low population frequency (2.3x10 5).

She refered that at birth she presented interauricular communication and patent ductus arteriosus, bilateral hexa dachtily and some ovoid vertebral bodies. The EvCS and Weyers acrofacial dysostosis (WAD) are allelic disorders that differ in inheritance and clinical severity. EvCS is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with variable expression characterized by short ribs, poly dactyly, short stature and ectodermal and heart defects. Mild expression of these features, alone or in combination, have been observed in parents of patients affected of EvCS and are interpreted as manifestations of heterozy gosity (so called WAD).

LNNS is a rare sporadic disease (<1:10.000).Case report: we report a 10 years boy with nevi on left side of face and mid line of neck. Family history was negative. He had refractory partial seizures and developmental delay. Brain MNR showed hemimegalencephaly. EEG had epileptiform bursts. There were retinal anomalies, coloboma, severe ocular hemangiomas and kyphoscoliosis. A diagnosis of LNSS was conside red. Excisional biopsy of nevus confirmed diagnosis of verrucous epidermal nevus with sebaceous anomalies. Conclusion: LNNS manifestations include linear epidermal nevus, seizures (75%), developmental delays (40%), ocular and skeletal involvement. This rare disease is hypothesized to result from postzygotic mosaic mutations in HRAS or KRAS genes. Isolated congenital sebaceous nevi are more frequent (1:1000). The risk of association with other organ involvement is greater when typical midline nevus has been identified. LNNS is a serious disease, because of cosmetic impact, malignant potential and severity of clinical ma nifestations. This case showes a very serious expression of LNNS, because of the organs involvement is in a very severe form. The diagnosis is difficult and late. It makes us think about the importance of early diagnosis and all children with a suspected diagnosis of LNSS should undergo a multidiscipli nary follow up.

Cytogenetic examination of bone marrow sample in 63 years old male patient with primary myelofibrosis proved the karyotype 46,X,dic(X; Y)(p22.3;p11.3)[20]. Acquired aberrations related to the myeloprolifera tive disorder were not identified. Beside the clone with 46,X,dic(X; Y)(p22.3;p11.3)[20], the cell line 45,X[10] was found by examination of PHA stimulated peripheral blood. FISH with probe for SHOX and SRY genes and subtelomers of Xp/Yp (Cytocell, Abbott Molecular) proved deletion of both subtelomeric regions, SHOX gene and conserved SRY locus on dicentric chromosome. The finding was verified by mFISH (24XCyte, MetaSystems) and array CGH/SNP (BlueGnome).Our proband have the short stature, Madelung deformity of the forearm and earÃÂ´s skin abnormality.

26723,"We report on a 15 year old boy with mild mental retardation, short stature (<3 rd centile), microcephaly (<3rd centile) and minor craniofacial dysmor phism. Conventional chromosome analysis revealed an apparently normal male karyotype (46,XY, GTG banding, BN 550). Array CGH analysis (Agilent 400K microarray) uncovered a duplication of approx. 2.1Mb in the chromo somal region 5q35.2 q35.3 comprising 43 genes including the NSD1 gene. This finding was confirmed by qPCR. The interstitial character of the micro duplication was proven by FISH analysis (ish 5q35.2 (RP11 627M5 enh)). Blood samples of the parents were not available. Deletions of the NSD1 gene, located in 5q35.3, are a known cause of Sotos syndrome which belongs to the overgrowth syndromes. The Sotos critical region spans over 1.9Mb and is flanked by two low copy repeat regions (Ku rotaki et al 2005). This genomic architecture predisposes to non allelic ho mologous recombination. The size and the location of the microduplication in our patient are located in the same regions suggesting a common mecha nism of the generation of the genomic imbalance as already described for other chromosomal regions (e.g. 22q11.2). The main features of our patient with a microduplication 5q35 are postnatal growth retardation, microce phaly without structural brain defects and a mild to moderate mental retar dation. This is in accordance to other patients with a microduplication 5q35 reported so far (Novara et al 2014). In part, the phenotype is reciprocal to Sotos syndrome suggesting a dosage effect of the NSD1 gene on growth, alt hough the exact mechanism of NSD1 function is not known in detail yet. E",2016
26724,"Introduction: Nager syndrome (Acrofacial Dysostosis type 1) is characteri zed by craniofacial and preaxial limb anomalies. Since 2012 various loss of function point mutations in SF3B4 have been identified in approximately 60% of patients with Nager syndrome. We report a 21 week old fetus with Nager syndrome features all ascribed to a previously unreported SF3B4 mu tation. Case description: A 36 year old woman was referred to our department at 20 weeks of gestation when morphologic ultrasound revealed severe mi crognathia. A level II scan confirmed this finding and detected upper limb anomalies (short humerus, ulnar hypoplasia, undetectable radial skeleton). The couple was informed of the fetal prognosis and chose termination. Auto psy revealed severe micrognathia, low set ears with hypoplastic antihelix, bilateral thumb agenesis, short long bones with bilateral radial aplasia and bowed ulnas,and bilateral clubfoot. Molecular analysis of the SF3B4 gene was performed on DNA extracted from amniocytes sampled before termi nation and from peripheral blood of both parents. A heterozygous variant c.34+1G>A in intron 1 of the SF3B4 gene was identified in fetal DNA but in neither of the parentsÃ¢ÂÂ DNA, indicating a de novo event. Conclusions: Since the variant detected in fetal DNA destroys the native splice donor site of intron 1, likely leading to exon skipping or to the usage of a cryptic splice site with possible nonsense mediated mRNA decay or to formation of a truncated protein, we regard our variant as a likely patho genic mutation. Our results are in agreement with previous observation of loss of function mutations adding a pathogenic splice variant to the SF3B4 mutational spectrum. E",2016

26727,"Introduction: Noonan like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH; OMIM 607721) is a RASopathy characterized by craniofacial features re sembling Noonan syndrome, cardiac defects (dysplasia of the mitral valve and septal defects), cognitive deficits and behavioral issues, reduced growth, darkly pigmented skin and an unique combination of ectodermal anomalies. A distinctive trait of NS/LAH is its association with easily pluckable, slow growing, sparse, and thin hair. This rare condition is due to the invariant c.4AÃ¢ÂÂ>Ã¢ÂÂG missense (p. Ser2Gly) change in SHOC2 gene, located in 10q25. This gene encodes a protein that consists almost entirely of leucine rich repeats, a domain implicated in protein protein interactions. The protein acts in the RAS/ERK MAP kinase signaling cascade. The p. Ser2Gly mutation creates a new recognition site for N terminal myristoylation, causing aberrant targe ting of SHOC2 protein to the plasma membrane and impaired translocation to the nucleus upon stimulation with growth factor. Here we report one NS/LAH case identified by exome sequencing. Materials and methods: The patient was a seven years old female with psy chomotor delay and facial dysmorphisms (easily pluckable, sparse and thin yellow hair, relative macrocephaly and low set ears), failure to thrive (with GH treatment), atrial septal defect, skin anomalies and epiphyseal dyspla sia. An exome study was perfomed by an external laboratory (Nimgenetics, Madrid). Results: The analysis of clinical exome (5678 genes) revealed the pathogenic c.4A>G mutation in SHOC2 gene associated with NS/LAH. Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the clinical utility of exome se quencing for rare diseases and it broadens the phenotype spectrum asso ciated with NS/LAH syndrome. E",2016

To clarify the aetiology of plurimalformative syn drome imposed the chromosomal analyse, we made GTG banding chromo somal analyse. The chromosomal formula was 46,X,Yqh+,1qh+,der(13;18)(q12;p11.2). We applied the C banding that confirmed the presence of one centromere. To clarify the chromosomal anomaly, we applied FISH analyse with Metasystem probes for prenatal detection of aneuploidy. Probes for chromosomes 13 and 21 are locus specific, while probe for chromosome 18 is centromeric. The analyse of derivative chromosome confirmed the pres ence of two fluorescent signals: one blue (specific for chromosome 18) and one green (specific for chromosome 13). Also, we made FISH analyse with Cytocell probes for subtelomeric region of 18p (74G18) and 18q (dJ964M9) and we found on the derivative chromosome the absence of 18p probe and the presence of 18q probe in a normal position at one end of derivative chro mosome.

This disorder has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The incidence of Noonan syndrome is estimated to be 1/1000 2500 live births. Despite being one of the most common seen in rare diseases, Noonan Syndrome can not be diagnosed with sufficient frequency. Our case was referred to the hospital because of growth retardation. Physi cal examination findings were prominent low set ears, high arched palate, downslanting palpebral fissures,epicanthal folds, low nasal bridge, uptur ned nose, bilateral ptosis, strabismus and pectus excavatum. Measurements of height, weight and head circumference were under 3 percentile. Nearly minimal coarctation of the aorta was defined in echocardiography. Neuro motor and endocrinological examination was normal. Materials and Me thods: Conventional cytogenetics analysis and PTPN11 gene mutation ana lysis were performed. Results: The result of karyotype analysis was 46,XY. The patient was diagnosed as Noonan Syndrome. PTPN11 gene mutation analysis was performed. Heterozygous mutations in 13.exon were identi fied [p.

Introduction: The syndrome Rubinstein Taybi (RSTS) is an autosomal do minant syndrome. RSTS1 is caused by heterozygous mutation. RSTS is cha racterized by mental retardation, delayed growth, microcephaly, facial dys morphia, broad thumbs and first toes, among others. Approximately 99% of RSTS occur sporadically. The birth prevalence is 1/125000 and diagnosis is based in clinical characteristics in most cases (Milani et al, 2015). Objective: To present an 8 year follow up of a male patient with RSTS. Case report: We describe a 13 years old male who at birth was diagnosed with congenital heart disease and bilateral undescended testes. At age one he is diagnosed with strabismus which was surgically corrected at 3. At 2 an orquiopexy was performed. At 4 he presented phsychomotor development, generalized hypertrichosis, facial dysmorphogical features, allergic rhinitis, intellectual disability, expressive language disorder and hetero aggressive behavior. Cranial CT scan, renal and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Physical examination showed low frontal hairline, arched thick eyebrows, prominent baked nose, micrognathia, high arched palate and dental maloc clusion, low set dysplastic ears, asymmetric thorax, broad thumbs and big toes. At 6 cardiological evaluation was normal and at 8 he continues with allergic rhinitis and conduct disorders. Conclusions: Clinical findings permit the diagnosis of RSTS in this patient. Multicenter studies are focused in establishing standard diagnostic criteria, providing professional management and follow up care of RSTS (Milani et al. 2015). RSTS can present brain malignant tumours and hematological dis orders.

Translocation between Xp and autosome disables inactivation of the translocated portion of X chromosome, and ove rexpresses the DAX1 gene located on DDS region. A severely malformed newborn was born after a complicated pregnancy. Dysmorphic features were distinct, including microcephaly, wide forehead, narrow eyelids, wide nose, micrognathia, unruly hair, narrow shoulders, ar throgryposis preferably on arms and hypoplastic female external genitalia with no palpable gonads. The baby had dilatated aortal root, vesicoureteral reflux and enlarged CNS ventricles. Ultrasonography of the genitalia showed streak mullerian structures and small underdeveloped testes in the lower abdomen. Due to the severe neurological impairment the baby died within the first months.

Many ge netic lesions are described across ALs subtypes, from recurrent reciprocal translocation to focal copy number changes and point mutations. The ge netic findings, alongside hematologic and immunophenotypic data, provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. We report on the results of genetic investigations in 101 adult patients with acute leukemias referred to our laboratory since 2011.Seventy seven acute myeloid leukemias (AML), 23 acute lymphoid leuke mias (ALL) and one biphenotypic leukemia (BAL) were investigated.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF ÃÂ±) and Lym photoxin alpha (LT ÃÂ±) have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of limphoproliferative diseases. Both cytokines regulate cell survival and cell death in leucemic cells. LT ÃÂ± has a well defined role in se condary lymphoid organogenesis and it also controls cellular proliferation and dif ferentiation . Since LT alpha is a potent controller of cell functions, it would be of interest to demonstrate that deregulation of LT ÃÂ± production in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients is genetically determined. . Materials and Methods: We investigated frequencies of polymorphic alleles and a pos sible association of LT alpha polymorphisms +250(G>A), with increased risk for acute lympho blastic leukemia (ALL). Genotype was analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism tech nique with genomic DNA isolated from pe ripheral blood lymphocytes. The research was performed on the DNA samples of 75 children suffering from ALL and 46 healthy individuals.

The role of the micronuclei in preferentially capturing the dmin and possibly its therapeutic potential in AML with a dmin karyotype was illu strated. Materials and Methods: A 79 year old woman presented with leukocytes of 4.8x10 9/L and 9% blasts. Conventional cytogenetics was performed on the bone marrow after overnight synchronised culture. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with IGH/MYC/CEP8 tri colour dual fusion probe (Vy sis) was performed on both cultured cell pellet and May Grunwald Giemsa stained bone marrow smears. Results: Karyotypic analysis showed 47,XX,+4,5~80dmin[19]/46,XX[1]. FISH showed MYC amplification in the dmin, but the MYC gene in one of the chromosomes 8 was deleted in all metaphases with presence of dmin. Multiple micronuclei formation by budding around the interphase nuclei was found in the cultured sample. The micronuclei were varied in size, with some being large and harbouring numerous MYC signals. In the myeloblasts of uncultured sample, only occasional micronuclei were found and they were tiny in size. Conclusion: FISH study has demonstrated the difference in micronuclei for mation due to MYC amplification in neat and cultured samples. It is tempting to speculate that the dmin type micronuclei are formed during the S phase in synchronized culture as a result of entrapment and elimination of dmin. Further study on cellular differentiation pathway may facilitate the under standing of dmin type micronuclei in disease modulation. E",2016

Currently, cytogenetic findings represent the most powerful prognostic factor in AML; however, about 35 to 50 percentage of the patients have a normal karyotype. Molecular markers allow precise classification of AML patients. Recent clinical studies have indicated that the expression le vel of LATS2 correlates with clinical course of some malignancies. The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression level of the LATS2 gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Materials and methods: Using quantitative real time PCR, the expression level of the LATS2 gene was de tected in peripheral blood samples from 32 patients with de novo AML and 10 normal controls. Results: LATS2 gene was significantly over expressed in AML patients com pared to normal subjects. Significant LATS2 over expression was also detec ted in all FAB types except for the M3.Conclusion: The present work provides the first evidence of the overexpres sion of LATS2 in AML patients and suggests that the gene might play a role in the disease development and hence may be a potential therapeutic target for AML treatment.

Results: In the proband with FAP phenotype and extracolonic involve ment, p. His1172Gln (c.3516delT) was detected in exon 15 of the APC gene. Furthermore, p. His1172Gln (c.3516delT) and in addition to this mutation, p. Met1413Val (c.4237 A>G) were detected in exon 15 in both daughters (which have FAP and attenuated FAP) of the proband. Similarly, p. Met1413Val (c.4237 A>G) nucleotide change was found in the mother of the girls. However, colonoscopic findings of the mother were normal. Conclusions: Single nucleotide change in codon 1413 may be a polymorphic variant. However, we believe that deletion T in codon 1172 of APC gene is as sociated with FAP , attenuated FAP and extracolonic FAP involvement. Along with common use of genetic tests in the clinical practice, genotype pheno type correlation may be recognized better and useful for early diagnosis and prevention of familial cancer syndromes.

26742,"Introduction: Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) ranks as the fourth most common childhood malignancy. To identify targets for new therapies, a through understanding of the genetic lesions contributing to establishment of the leukemic clone and resistance to therapy is required. The goals of the study were to provide an explanation for the observed diffe rences in outcome among patients who relapse early and to define high risk patients much better. Materials and Methods: We examined gene expression profiles in 20 child hood B cell ALL and healthy B cell subsets by using Ã¢ÂÂIllumina HumanHT 12 v4 Expression BeadChipÃ¢ÂÂ technology. According to the differential analysis, selected eight genes had been validated in a larger B ALL cohort (n,81 pati ents) by using Quantitative Real Time PCR. Results and Conclusions: Diagnose patients who had relapse showed diffe rential expression in cell cycle, apoptosis, purine/pyrimidine metabolism, and different cancer pathways. Many of these pathways have been implica ted in tumorgenesis previously and are attractive targets for intervention strategies. After the validation process, aberrant PMAIP1 and RASD1 ex pression had been linked with relapsed. PMAIP1 is related with ERK Signa ling and apoptosis, RASD1 is related with MAPK targets. However, further studies are required to understand the impact of RASD1 and PMAIP1 genes in drug resistance in B cell ALL.

26743,"Introduction. Leukemia is the most common form of childhood cancer. Ge netic analysis holds a true prognostic value for childhood leukemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in childhood ALL. Materials Methods. 115 childhood ALL patients were evaluated for cyoge netics and FISH ( BCR/ABL, TEL/AML1 and MLL) Results. Cytogenetic aberration was found in 54.4% of patients. Hyperdiplo idy rate was %12 with gains for chromosomes 4, 14 and 21. Hypodiploidy rate was 1.7%. FISH aberration was found in 52.2% of patients. Polisomy 21 (amplification 21) was the most frequent anomaly (25.2%). TEL/AML1 fusion rate was 13.9% whereas BCR/ABL fusion rate was 3.5%. TEL/AML1 fusion was found less in group with polisomy 21. MLL rearrangement rate was 5.4%. No relapse was found in patients with TEL/AML 1 fusion. One patient died of sepsis. Overall survival rate of patients with positive TEL/AML1 fusion was high. Mortality rate of the patients with a BRC/ABL fusion, was higher (50%); the survival rate was shorter (25%) when compared to those who did not have the fusion. The group with amplification 21also showed a higher rate of re lapse (17%) and mortality (10%) and a shorter survival rate. Conclusion. Polysomy 21 is not rare in chilhood ALL; it is a poor prognostic indicator with rates not as high but similar to bcr/abl fusion. TEL/AML1 predicts a good prognosis. It was of interest to note that existence of polyso my 21 decreased the rate of TEL/AML1 fusion. E",2016
26744,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of aggressive neo plasms and the most common type of adult acute leukemia, with a median age of 67 years at diagnosis. Since high quality metaphase spreads are hard to obtain from bone marrow samples of the patients with AML/MDS it is quite difficult to detect the chromosomal abnormalities in AML/MDS using conventional cytogenetic analysis with standard G banding. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a very simple and useful technique that is ap plied by many cytogenetics laboratories around the world for routine dia gnosis of AML/MDS. Here we report the FISH results of 185 patients who were referred to our la boratory with pre diagnosis of AML/MDS between January 2014 and Janua ry 2016. A total of 141 patients had normal FISH results while the most fre quent abnormalities were MLL translocation (10/185, 5.4%), PML/RARA translocation (4/185, 2.1%), and trisomy 8 (4/185, 2.1%). We also detected complex rearrangements in five patients (2.7%). Moreover, we analyzed the relation between chromosomal abnormalities and clinicopathological para meters. In conclusion, a significant proportion of AML/MDS patients with normal karyotype has clones of cytogenetically abnormal cells which may play an important role in the development and/or progression of the disease. It is important to determine the presence or absence of specific chromosome and/or gene alterations by FISH analysis for the prognosis and survival of the patients. E",2016

Materials & Methods:Bladder tumor samples were collected, frozen at 20 ÃÂ°C and histologically confirmed as primary transitional cell carcinomas. The DNA was isolated by phenol chlorophorm extraction and aCGH analysis was performed on twel ve tumors in stages pTa, pT1, pT2, pT2a and pT2b on CytoChip Oligo aCGH, 4x44K format (Illumina). Data was analyzed by BluefuseMulti software v4.2. The clinical significance was further evaluated by literature and database search. Results and discussion: The DNA microarray showed an increased genomic instability and revealed numerous nonspecific chromosomal aberrations in the transitional cell carcinomas 75 pathogenic deletions and duplications, 3 benign CNVs and 14 variants of uncertain clinical significance. A total of 24 recurring chromosomal regions with pathogenic CNVs were identified. Genomic imbalance in four of these regions, containing more than 200 ge nes, is present in 50% of the tumors with aberrations (pT1, pT2 and pT2b). A detailed survey was performed for all of these genes and 31 of them were found to be probably associated with the process of tumorigenesis. Of these, 10 are already reported by other scientific groups as candidate oncogenes for uroepithelial tumours.

26747," Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer types seen in women. Around 10% of overall breast cancer cases have family history. Carriers of BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations from families with high cancer risk have been estimated to have a 65 85% lifetime risk of developing breast/ovarian cancer. In addition to pathogenic alterations of BRCA1/BRCA2 genes, seve ral polymorphisms have also been reported. Many of these polymorphisms are shown to have protective or possible causal effect on breast cancer for mation. Interestingly, several studies showed that some of these polymor phisms tend to occur together although their effects are opposite. In this study, BRCA1/2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined for the identification of haplotypes and to evaluate the prevalence of these haplotypes among sporadic early onset breast cancer patients, familial bre ast cancer patients, and healthy high risk females in multiple ethnic regions of Turkey. Peripheral blood DNA samples from 271 subjects were investigated by next generation sequencing (NGS) using IllumÃÂ±na MiSeq. Genomize Seq and Se qPilot softwares were used for analysis of NGS data.

26748,"Introduction: BRCA1/2 genes mutations are the most common cause of he reditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). We present an analysis of mo noinstitutional cohort of unrelated BRCA1/2 mutations carriers. Methods: We analyzed 230 BRCA1/2 tests for 5 BRCA1 and 1 BRCA2 mutati ons performed in 2015. Data on 23 BRCA1 mutation carriers were collected. The results were compared with data on Lithuanian and European BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Results: Three BRCA1 mutations were identified in 10% of patients tested for HBOC (39.1% 4153delA, 34.8% 5382insC, 26.1% 300T>G). Other two BRCA1 mutations (185delAG, 2080delA) and BRCA2 mutation 6174delT were not detected. Among BRCA1 mutation carriers 82.6% have positive family history; 47.8% have breast cancer; 34.8% have triple negative breast cancer; 34.8% have ovarian cancer. A study of Janavicius and al. (2014) in dentified BRCA1/2 mutations in 29% of patients selected for genetic testing (BRCA1 Ã¢ÂÂ 25.9%). The most common BRCA1/2 mutation was also 4153delA Ã¢ÂÂ a Baltic founder mutation. Our tested mutations amount for 76.7% of found BRCA1/2 mutation in Lithuanian carriers. European studies of full or nearly full sequence analysis of BRCA1/2 genes revealed higher prevalence of pathogenic mutations in high risk women (see table 1).Conclusion: Identified mutation rate significantly differs from other Lithua nian and Europe studies and is insufficient.

26749,"Introduction: Application of BRCA1/2 testing to clinical praxis provided much information about one of the most frequent familiar cancer breast and ovarian cancer. Usually, family members carrying pathogenic variant in these genes have higher risk of cancer than non carriers. These family members are screened in earlier age and more frequently than the rest of population. It can help to distinguish cancer in earlier stages and these pati ents have bigger chance for successful treatment. Sometimes, phenotype of family members does not fit to their genotype. Materials and Methods: We searched pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 genes using massive parallel sequencing. We used BRCA MASTRÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Dx kit (Multipli com) and platform MiSeq (Illumina). We used Sanger sequencing for confir mation and for testing family members. Results: We identified previously described pathogenic variant in BRCA1 gene (rs80357609) in mother born in 1950. She developed breast cancer in 1995. Therefore, we tested her daughters for the presence of this variant. We have found that one daughter (born in 1976) carries this variant but she is still without symptoms. The second daughter (born in 1971) does not carry this variant but she developed breast cancer in the same age as her mother. Conclusions: We identified family with breast cancer history whose family membersÃ¢ÂÂ genotype does not fully correlate with their phenotype. It might be caused by phenomenon known as phenocopy, which is non hereditary, environmentally induced trait. It could explain the same phenotype of dau ghter non carrying pathogenic variant as her mother with BRCA1 mutation has. E",2016

Howe ver, pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are only detected in approximately 25% of patients with a strong family history, while almost 1,800 distinct sequence variants have been described with uncertain clini cal significance. Methods: The entire coding region and splice site junctions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were amplified by PCR and analyzed through direct San ger DNA sequencing. Results: A female proband diagnosed with breast cancer was selected for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing according to established criteria. A he terozygous intronic variant within intron 7 of the BRCA2 gene, c.632 3C>G (rs568027879) was identified. The same variant was detected in two other affected family members, one female and one male. In silico analysis per formed with multiple tools predicted an impact in the splicing pattern. This variant was not reported in the Breast Cancer Information Core Database (BIC). However, it is described in the Universal Mutation and ClinVar data bases as a variant of unknown significance. Conclusions: We report, for the first time, co segregation data for a BRCA2 splicing variant in three family members, including one male, diagnosed with primary breast cancer. This strongly suggests that the variant c.632 3C>G is a novel pathogenic splicing mutation. E",2016

Folate metabolizing enzymes may influence the bioavailability of methyl groups and synthesis of nucleotides, whereas DNA methyltransferases are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We made a suggestion that genetic variants of folate metabolizing enzymes and DNA methyltransferase may lead to differences in susceptibility to can cer development. Materials and Method. Genotyping of MTHFR 677C>T , MTR 2756A>G, TS 3R2R, TS 3R G>C and DNMT3B 149C>T and DNMT3B 579G>T was perfor med in 60 patients with leukemia, 90 patients with breast cancer and in 100 healthy persons without cancer pathology in anamnesis. The molecular ge netic analysis was performed by Polymerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted by Chi square tests and odds ratio (OR) calculation. Results. We did not observe any signiÃ¯Â¬Âcant differences in genotype frequen cies of the MTHFR, TS and DNMT3B polymorphisms between the cases and controls. The MTR 2756ÃÂÃÂ genotype frequency was significant higher in patients with breast cancer vs control (0.67 vs 0.50, p, 0.02).

FISH abnormalities were cor related with age, sex, WBC, Rai stage, survival, LDH, ÃÂ²2 miccroglobulin and treatment. CLLU1 expression was also quantified. Results. FISH aberrations were found in 62% of patients: 13q14 deletion, 66.6%; trisomy 12, 27%; ATM deletion, 19%, TP53 deletion, 8% and IGH rearrangement 20%. Mortality rate was 40% with del 11q22 and del 17p (Tp53), 28% with del 13q14, 15% patients with trisomy 12. Overall survival was 98 ÃÂ±22mo for del 13q14, and 69 ÃÂ±19mo for del 11q22. Need of medica tion was 89% for del 11q22 and del 17p, 42% for others. The most frequent abnormality in progressive disease was ATM and TP53 deletion. Majority of the patients with stable disease showed heterozygous 13q14 deletion. Patients with homozygous 13q deletions yielded a shorter overall survival. Patients with IGH rearrangements yielded double increased mortality and treatment rate and shorter overall survival. There was no CLLU1 expressi on in healthy controls; in patients1x 10 4 CLLU1 expression was detected. Higher CLLU1 expression was shorter survival and more patients needed medication (46% versus 21%). CONCLUSION: Routine usage of FISH analysis is still indicated for progno stic evaluation of the CLL patients. Special consideration is needed for the poor prognostic implication of del 11q22, del 17p, IGH rearrangement and homozygous del 13q14. CLLU1 expression seems to have correlation with poor prognosis.

There was designed a microplate with miRNAs which are documented to be involved in apoptosis in CLL mir 222, mir 21, mir 143, mir 21 and mir 29, and miRNAs involved in apoptosis with an unknown role in CLL mir 149, mir 200c, mir 204, mir 210, mir 221, mir 409, mir 449, let 7c, let7 g and mir 708. After stem loop primer reverse transcription, the samples were analyzed using TaqMan chemistry and evaluated by delt adelta Ct algorithm with 7500 Software v2.0.1. Differences in relative gene expression were analyzed by Wilcoxon test of the mean RQ,1 at the signi ficance levels p < 0.05. Results: Application of the Wilcoxon test of the mean to test statistical signi ficance for the differential miRNA expression showed that the downregu lation is statistically significant for mir 133b, mir 143, mir 149, mir 200c, mir 204, mir 221, mir 222, mir 409 and mir 708.Conclusion: The downregulation of miRNAs expression can be caused by their promoter methylation which was already demonstrated for mir 708 in CLL. We are going to validate these results on the larger patientÃ¢ÂÂs cohort and to analyze the role of miRNA methylation in the downregulation of these miRNAs.

26760,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease re sulting from neoplastic transformation of multipotent stem cells. It is cha racterized by the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) occurred in 95% of cases, resulting from translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which leads to the formati on of Bcr Abl fusion gene encoding a product involved in CML pathogenesis. Aurora kinases are the most important serine/threonine protein kinases regulating function of centrosomes, spindles and kinetochores. It has been reported that aurora A and B have overexpression in various malignity such as breast, colon, neuroblastoma, pancreas and over cancer. However, it has been indicated that Bcr Abl induce the expression of these kinases in CML cells and claim that aurora kinase inhibitors have potential advantage in treatment of CML. CCT137690 is a highly selective aurora kinase inhibitor. In this study, we aimed to determine the apoptotic effect of CCT137690 on KU812 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. WST 8 assay was done to determine cytotoxic effect of CCT137690 on KU812 cells and IC50 dose was found 6.24ÃÂµM for 48 h. The effect of IC50 dose on apoptosis and cell cycle was evaluated with Annexin V EGFP Apo ptosis Detection Kit and BD Cycletes Plus DNA Reagent Kit, respectively. The IC50 dose CCT137690 was found to induce apoptosis in 9 fold compared to control and to arrest cell cycle at G2/M phase. In conclusion, this study has supportive quality for opinion that aurora kina se inhibitors have potential advantage in treatment of CML, because of that CCT137690 highly induce apoptosis and cause cell cycle arrest.

26761,"Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukaemias (CML) usually harbour a reci procal chromosomal translocation t(9;22) that results in the Philadelphia chromosome, leading to the formation of the BCR ABL1 fusion gene. In a minority of CML patients, the BCR ABL1 chimera can be formed through cy togenetically cryptic rearrangements and present an apparently normal ka ryotype. In order to correctly identify all the patients that can benefit from a TKI therapy, a multidisciplinary approach should be taken. Materials and methods: Classical cytogenetics, molecular studies and fluo rescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed in bone marrow samples of two CML cases. Results: Karyotype analysis of both cases did not show chromosomes 9 and 22 rearrangements. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of the BCR ABL1 fusion gene. FISH studies showed the occurrence of the BCR ABL1 fu sion in chromosome 9 in both cases. Conclusion: These two examples demonstrate the importance of a multidis ciplinary approach to establish a correct genetic diagnosis and characteri zation of CML cases. E",2016
26762,"Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by increased tyrosine kinase activity due to BCR/ABL translocation. Dasatinib is tyrosi ne kinase inhibitor that is more effective than imatinib but 20% of patients donÃ¢ÂÂt respond to treatment. Therefore, other molecular approaches should be investigated. For that purpose, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that is found genetically altered or functionally inactive in CML, may be promising therapeutic target. PP2A is consist of three subunits and involved in many cellular function. In our study, we aimed to evaluate PP2A enzyme activity and protein level in dasatinib treated K562 cell line. Materials and Methods: The cytotoxic effect of dasatinib was evaluated by WST 1 analysis. Apoptotis was determined by Annexin V and Apo Direct Tunel assays. Okadaic acid (OA) was used as PP2A inhibitor. The changes of PP2A enyzme and protein levels were observed by serine/threonine phos phatase and western blot analysis, respectively. Results: The cytotoxic effect of dasatinib in K562 cells was found 4.6 nM at 48th hour. According to Annexin V, apoptosis was increased 2.35 and 3.76 fold by treating with dasatinib and 2.5 ÃÂµM and 25 ÃÂµM OA combination, re spectively. According to Tunel assay, apoptosis was induced 16.45 and 49.38 fold in same order. The PP2A enzyme activity decreased compared to con trol at 72nd hour. Protein level of PP2A catalytic subunit decreased compa red to control by dasatinib treatment. Conclusions: We found that PP2A has major role in cell homeostasis and apoptosis. Thus, we could say that targeting PP2A inhibitors may be promi sing therapeutic approach for CML. E",2016
26763,"Introduction: Mutations of KRAS gene at codon 12 and 13 are resistant to targeted therapies with anti epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies in colorectal cancer. Detection of KRAS mutations is critical for effective and appropriate treatment for individual patients. The aim of the present study was to develop Allele Specific PCR (AS PCR) assay for analysis of the mutational status of KRAS codons 12 and 13, at nucleotides 34, 35 and 38.Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from 41 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer tissues. The AS primers for specific amplifying wild type KRAS were established. The assay has been validated with pyrosequencing method. The sensitivity and limit of detection were determined. Results: Three AS primers were successfully distinguished wild type KRAS from the mutant alleles at nucleotides 34, 35 and 38. The limit of detection was detected at 50 55% mutant allele with the lowest amount of DNA at 10 ng/ul. The results of AS PCR assay were in good concordance with pyrose quencing only in samples with % mutant alleles greater than 60%. The sen sitivity and specificity of our AS PCR were 43.33% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated that AS PCR specific for wild type KRAS at nucleotides 34, 35 and 38 could detect mutations in highly mutant enriched tumor samples.

26764,"Introduction: The RNAi based approaches for cancer treatment implies searching for new targets genes. The MCM4 gene encoding the subunit of helicase, is involved into development replication stress and cell cycle con trol. The purpose of this study to increase knowledge on MCM4 gene expres sion, evaluate the possibility of its use in tumor therapy. Materials and Methods: The study conducted using colorectal cancer cells line HT 29. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX was used for delivery of designed siRNA. Flow cytometry was employed for cell cycle analysis. Antibodies against AIF protein and fluorescent inhibitor of caspases 3 and 7 used for apoptosis study. Results: It was discovered that low dose of oxaliplatin (1 5mM) up regulates MCM4 gene mRNA expression more than 3 5 folds. The gene silencing indu ces apoptotic HT 29 cell death. The event is time and dose dependent. It was shown that MCM4 silencing lead to accumulation of cells in G1 phase after 48 hours of exposure. Apoptotic cell death reached 60%. The analysis of apoptotic pathways revealed that there is no influence of AIF. The main mechanism of cell death is associated with identified activation of caspases 3 and 7. Adding to the cell culture inhibitor of caspases 3 and 7 (Z DEVD FMK) significantly reduces the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. Conclusion: Thus, the activation of caspase dependent pathway is the main cause of cell death after MCM4 gene silencing in presence of oxaliplatin. This opens up new opportunities to create target drugs, which should help to avoid the problem of resistance during oxaliplatin treatment. E",2016
26765,"An uncontrolled proliferation of plasma cells which play a role in immune system is called Multiple Myeloma (MM). It is the second most common he matologic malignancy in the United States, and accounts for approximately 1% of all cancer cases. Currently, detection of chromosomal abnormalities is accepted as a important tool for predicting outcome in newly diagnosed MM patients (1). In this retrospective study, we aimed to determine cyto genetic findings using by conventional cytogenetics and FISH methods in 435 patients with MM. Cytogenetics analysis was successful in 367 pati ents (84,4%) and unsuccessful in 68 patients (15,6%). Ninety nine of 367 (27%) patients were found to have an abnormal karyotype. Of 99 patients, 19 patients (19,2%) had hyperdiploidy (>47), 40 patients (40,4%) had hy podiploidy (Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 45), and 25 patients (25,2%) had pseudodiploidy. In additi on, only the loss of Y chromosome was found in 15 patients (%15,2) and these patients were classified in as a separate group. The presence of both structural and numerical chromosome abnormalities were detected in 36 patients (36,4%); 40 patients (40,4%) had only numerical abnormalities; 23 patients (23,2%) had only structural abnormalities. In this study, spesi fic FISH probes for t(4;14),t(11;14), t(14;16),del(11q22.3),del(17p13) and del(13q14) was applied to the slides of patients. By FISH analysis, the most frequently abnormality, del(13q14), was observed in 14,5% (33/228) and del(17p) was determined the second most frequently abnormality in 7,65% (18/235) of patients.

MYC rearrangements occur in 5 10% of DLBCL patients. Since we have very limi ted experience in patients with isolated MYC rearrangements, the progno stic significance of this cytogenetic abnormality is still unknown. AIM: In this study, we aimed to investigate the frequency and prognostic significance of MYC rearrangements in patients with DLBCL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 46 patients with DLBCL were inclu ded in this study. Deparaffinized samples were evaluated by FISH using MYC, BCL6 and BCL2/IGH and CCND1/IGH probes. RESULTS: Rearrangement of MYC was found in 16 patients (34%). Of these patients, 9 were double hit and 2 were triple hit lymphomas. When we com pared the prognostic markers including stage, IPI and LDH between MYC+ and MYC patients, we found a significant difference in stage and LDH values between the groups (p,0,004 and p,0,037, respectively). IPI score did not show any difference between isolated MYC+, two hit and three hit patients (p>0,05).DISCUSSION: MYC rearrangements confer a worse effect on prognostic fac tors such as IPI, tumor stage, and survival. In this study, tumor stage and LDH values showed significant difference between MYC+ and MYC patients in consistent with the previous literature. However, the presence of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements in MYC patients conferred a prognostic effect. To address the prognostic impact of MYC rearrangement, we need a higher number of isolated MYC+ and three negative patients considering BCL2 and BCL6 aberrations. E",2016
26767,"Myeloid leukemias results from malignant transformation of primitive he matopoietic cell and it is suggested that leukemia stem cells are malignant derivatives of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Leukemia stem cells have si milar features with normal stem cells including self renewal, differentiation and infinite proliferation. Resveratrol, which is a potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent, is found in red grape. Previous studies have shown that resveratrol has anti tumorigenic effect in several cancer types. It has been shown that DMU 212 usually induces G2/M arrest through limited studies which are related to resveratrol analogs. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of DMU 212 on apoptosis, cell cycle and also proliferation in human leukemia stem cells. Cytotoxicity of DMU 212(30 ÃÂ¼M 0.5 ÃÂ¼M) on human leukemia stem cell line (LSC) were evaluated with Cell Proliferation Reagent WST1 test. Changes of apoptosis and cell cycle in LSCs with exposure to IC50 dose of DMU 212 are detected with AnnexinV EGFP Apoptosis Detection Kit and Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent Kit with FACS, respectively. IC50 dose of DMU 212 was calculated as 27,97 ÃÂ¼M. It was shown that DMU 212 couldnÃ¢ÂÂt induce apoptosis during 48 hours. Beside that, LSCs accumula ted in G2/M phase of the cell cycle with the exposure of 27,97 ÃÂµM DMU 212.In conclusion, our hypothesis suggests that DMU 212 may influence the cell cycle pattern of leukemia stem cell line due to G2/M arrest significantly. Therefore, DMU 212 may be considered as an additional anticancer agent in leukemia treatment. E",2016

Prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145, and LNCaP exhibit variable EpCAM expression. While the metastatic potential of each line is understood, there is little consensus on EpCAM ex pression. Using single cell mRNA sequencing enables simultaneous observa tion of hundreds of genes, elucidating the interplay of EpCAM in metastasis. The BD FACSseqÃ¢ÂÂ¢, a new easy to use sorter, was employed to deliver sin gle cells and eliminate doublets or higher order aggregates for single cell mRNA Seq analysis. Accurate single cell delivery into 96 well plates was confirmed. Several hundred cells were examined by transcript analysis of 110 genes associated with prostate cancer using BDÃ¢ÂÂ¢ Precise encoded pla tes, which incorporate molecular indexing and sample barcodes to achieve high fidelity gene profiling. For each of the three cell lines, EpCAM prote in level distribution was recorded through index sorting, revealing broad distributions for PC3 and DU145. Index sorting on the BD FACSseq enabled protein expression to be tied to gene transcript count for each cell analyzed. Genes expressing differential regulation from the panel were correlated to EpCAM expression, indicating which may influence metastatic potential. The accurate delivery of individual cells by flow cytometry paired with sin gle cell sequencing technologies can enable researchers to investigate tran scriptional dynamics at the individual cellular level, disambiguating sample heterogeneities. These results aid in understanding the centrality of EpCAM, a possible therapeutic target, during the transition to androgen resistant, metastatic cancers. E",2016

Recent studies on bone marrow stem cells showed that PHD inhibitors stimulate the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization. Furthermore, PHD2 gene ablation was reported to increase the self renewal of HSCs. To better understand the role of PHD1 gene on malign hematopoietic cells we performed the expression analysis of PHD1 gene of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells.

26773,"Introduction: Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in hu mans. Glioblastoma, grade IV of glioma tumors, is one of the most aggressi ve and deadly forms of cancer with the median survival of 15 months even though significant advances in treatment strategies. Retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, modulates the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a wide variety of normal and tumor cells. It has been used in clinical trials on glioma tumors, but the efficiency of treatment was hete rogeneous. Materials and Methods: U251 cell line, one of the most widely used in vitro model system for studying glioblastoma pathobiology, was used to analyze the effects of RA on cell morphology (staining of microtubule cytoskeleton protein), viability (MTT test), proliferation (Ki 67 staining), migratory po tential (Wound Scratch Assay Test) and adhesion ability (Cell Matrix Adhe sion Assay). Cells were exposed to 10, 20 and 40 microM all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and analyzed in two time points (3 and 5 days). Results: Our results reveal that ATRA can cause changes in cell morphology, viability and migratory capabilities. On the other side, treatment with ATRA did not influence the U251 proliferation rate. Additionally, only 5 days treat ment of U251 cells with 10microM ATRA changes the adhesion ability of U251 cells compared to control cells. Conclusions: Obtain results indicate that ATRA treatment is associated with modification of some important features of U251 cells.

Mozuku, type of moss/algae, is a commonly consumed food in Japan and is a rich source of alginic acid, caratenoid, vitamin C, vitamin K, amin acids, iron, phosphorous, calcium and fucoidan. Fucoidan, a complex sulphated polysaccharide, has been reported to have several biological activities in cluding anti inflammatory, anti angiogenic and anti tumor activities. In our presented research, we investigated the anti tumor activity of Fucoidan on the UT SCC 74A head and neck cancer line. First, we investigated the anti proliferation activity of fucoidan by using xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analysis system. Fucoidan inhibits the cancer cell proliferation compared to the control group. Afterwards, to investigate whether this inhibition was due to cell cycle arrest, we investigated the p21 level. p21 level was significantly upregulated in the cancer cell line after fu coidan treatment. Even though our preliminary result suggest that inhibiti on of proliferation observed was potentially due to cell cycle arrest, further experiments needed to confirm and support our findings.

Here we report the case of a 67 year old female with metachronous colorectal can cer without any family history of cancer. The attending physician ordered pathological analysis of tumour tissue to identify microsatellite status and immunhistochemical (IHC) status of the MMR proteins. The tests revealed highly microsatellite instability and inconsistent IHC results due to lack of both MSH2 and PMS2 proteins. Subsequent sequencing of all four MMR ge nes via Next Generation Sequencing and Sanger technology, as well as MLPA analysis of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was performed to identify small and larger sequence variants.

However, after increasing sample size only the rs11680458 and rs11638 SNPs, located in the genes WDR43 y HELLS, respectively showed a significant association with an increased risk of developing CML. Conclusions: The rs11680458 and rs11638 SNPs located in the genes WDR43 y HELLS could be associated with the susceptibility to CML. INMEGEN: CON31/2011.CONACyT: CB 2014 01 243587 E",2016
26779,"Lung cancer with a poor prognosis and lower survival is a worldwide di sease often accompanied by family history in around the world. The cases of lung cancer are often caused by long term exposure to tobacco smoke, a combination of genetic factors and other forms of air pollution. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are able to suppress the translation of mRNA into protein so have key roles in mechanisms of cancer cells. miRNAs are classified as oncogenic or tumor suppressor miRNAs depending on the functions of their mRNA targets in molecular pathways. It has reported that epigenetic me chanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, may be af fected by this regulation. The miRNA group targeting the epigenetic control components called epi miRNA. miR 200b 3p and miR 1274a are members of the epi miRNA family. miR 200b 3p and miR 1274a target, respective ly DNMT3a and DNMT3b. We aimed to determine the association of miR 200b 3p and miR 1274a gene expressions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with lung cancer. This study included 90 patients with lung cancer and 90 healthy controls. PBMCs were isolated by using Ficoll gra dient centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from these cells, and quan titative Reverse Transcriptase PCR (qRT PCR) analysis of miR 200b 3p ve miR 1274a was performed as described in a commercial kit manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs instructions. When miR 200b 3p and miR 1274a gene expression levels compared between the groups, both of them were decreased significantly in patients with lung cancer (P<0.05).

26780,"Background: Mature lymphoid neoplasms are an extremely heterogenous group of malignancies with regard to biological, clinical and morphological features. The identification of recurrent chromosomal changes has a major impact on the classification of mature lymphoid neoplasms. Patients and Methods: We investigated 649 patients (354 men, 295 woman, average age 62) with primary mature lymphoid neoplasm in years 2010 2015 of which 68 were examinated repeatedly. The conventional cytogene tic analysis (CCA) was performed on bone marrow samples using short time cultivation (24 48 hours) without stimulation. If it was required, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I FISH) was performed (most often to detect IGH, BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangement).Results: We cultivated 98 % of samples succesfully. Chromosomal aberrati ons were detected in 20 % of patients analyzed using CCA and I FISH. CCA revealed chromosomal aberrations in 9 % of patients with negative I FISH results. Conclusion/summary: Our comparison with Overview of frequent and dia gnostically relevant chromosomal aberrations in mature lymphoid neoplas ms (Heim and Mitelman, 2015) will be discussed in the poster. According to our results it is important to combined both cytogenetic methods (CCA and I FISH) to characterize recurrent chromosomal changes to correct clas sification of mature lymphoid neoplasms and suggest appropriate therapy.

Because the etiological causes are not entirely known in lymphoma, we sought a correlation between GST P1, T1 and M1 gene polymorphism according to risk of disease and evolution using Ann Arbor classification. Material and methods: We enrolled 99 patients with different types of lym phoma and 200 control subjects without a malignancy history. Using PCR technique we determine the presence or absence of this gene. Results: The average age for patients group is 57.5 ÃÂ±36.3 and they represent all patients diagnose in the last 10 years in central region of Romania. The distribution of GST P1 Ile105Val genotype in patients group was: 70.7%Ile/ Ile, 23.2%Ile/Val and 6.1%Val/Val and for GST T1/M1: 30.3%T1/M1, 38.3%T1/T1, 10%M1/M1 and 21.4%NULL. For control group GST P1 was found in the following percentage: 58.5%Ile/Ile, 33.5Ile/Val and 8%Val/Val, and GST T1/M1 40.5%T1/M1, 41.5%T1/T1, 9.5%M1/M1 and 8.5%NULL.

MTHFR gene polymorphism, mainly the C677T , have been implicated as risk factors for several types of cancers as the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In addition, a potential impact of such variant in the efficacy of methotrexate has been reported. In this study we evaluated the presence of the C677T variant of MTHFR in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients from Tunisia. To provide new in sights for a personalised therapy based on the human genotype. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA antico agulant blood samples from a total of 35 patients suffering from ALL. Ge notyping were carried out with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).Results: : The allelic frequency of the C677T variant of MTHFR was 13.6% in ALL patients, with a particular history of relapse and toxicity during me thotrexate therapy. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that C677T polymorphism of MTHFR is com mon in Tunisian ALL and affect clinical outcome. Thus, we insist that Genoty ping of MTHFR polymorphism, C677T particularly, prior to treatment for ALL is likely to be useful in order to personalize therapy and reduce the MTX related toxicities.

Chromosome 1 ab normalities are found in almost half of MM cases and are associated with aggressive disease. The most common structural changes that involve chro mosome 1 are 1p deletion and 1q gain. Patients and Methods: Between 2009 2014, 27 MM patients (6 women, 21 men, median age 68) showed chromosomal abnormalities by conventional chromosome banding (CCB). Bone marrow aspirates were processed using short time cultivation (24 48 hours) without stimulation. A minimum of IGH rearrangement and 13q deletion was performed in all cases by cytoplasmic immunoglobin light chain staining (cIg FISH).Chromosome 1 abnormalities were confirmed by CCB, cIg FISH or FISH and multicolor FISH. Results: Chromosome 1 aberrations were detected in 15/27 patients. Dele tions were identified in 11/15 patients: 1p deletions as a result of unbalan ced translocation (8/11), 1p intersticial or terminal deletions (2/11) and 1q deletion (1/11). Gains were caused by unbalanced translocation in 10/15 patients: 1q12 qter (5/10), 1q21 qter (3/10), 1q22 qter (1/10) and 1p21 qter (1/10). Trisomy 1 was presented in 1/15 patient.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of morbidity and morta lity, representing the second most frequently occurring cancer among fema les and the third among males. The presence of the RAS mutations in colorectal cancer patients correlates with lack of response to the certain EGFR inhibitor therapies. We used the SNaPshot analysis to detect somatic mutations in KRAS/NRAS (codons: 12, 13, 59, 61, 117, 146) and BRAF genes (codon 600).The microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype represents ~15% of all CRCs and is caused by deficient DNA mismatch repair mechanism (MMR), which is a consequence of germline mutations in MMR genes or epigenetic silen cing of the MLH1 gene. We used the MSI analysis for universal colorectal tumor testing: 1. MSI H status is a marker of favourable prognosis and not benefit from 5 fluorouracil based adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II. 2. MSI H status is the hallmark of HNPCC associated tumors. Approximately 5 10% of all CRC have hereditary background and the most common is Lynch syndrome (LS). Patients with LS are carriers of a mutation in MMR genes. Identification of a mutation is not only important for a pati ent, but also for his or hers relatives.

The patient with a novel frameshift indel is 27 years old woman with clinical characteristics of hydrocephalus, perifocal edema of the brainstem and cere bellar vermis. The doctors suggested that the tumor formation in fourth ven tricle is probable ependymoma or hemangiopericytoma. Tumor formations in other part of patientÃ¢ÂÂs body are absent. The detected novel molecular de fect in exon 3 of the VHL gene is a complex indel c.[516_517insAGTCAAGCCT; 532_542delCTGGACATCGTinsATTA], p. Glu173Serfs*4. The possible mecha nism for mutation generation involves the genetic architecture of the neigh boring area rich in repeated elements. The genetic testing provides the possibility for adequate genetic counseling and prenatal diagnostics in affected families.

Polymorphisms of this genes may influence the capacity of DNA repair sy stem and therefore may predispose to malignancy, including leukemia. We performed a case control study to investigate the relation between XPF 673C>T , XPF 11985A>G and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a Roma nian population. We investigated 82 adult CML patients which were Ph1 / BCR ABL positive and 170 subjects with no history of cancer. We found no association between several prognostic factors such as blasts, basophils, additional chromosomal abnormalities and XPF 673C>T , XPF 11985A>G polymorphisms in our CML cohort. No differences were found when we ex amined the distribution of variant genotypes of XPF gene polymorphisms according to EUTOS score. We also looked whether there was any relation between investigated XPG polymorphisms and treatment, but no associati on was noticed. According to our data XPF 673C>T and XPF 11985A>G do not represent risk factors for development of CML. We consider that further study on a larger CML cohort is required to validate our observations.

The PTPN22 ABSTRACTS ELECTRONIC POSTERS ESHG 2016 | BARCELONA, SPAIN | WWW. ESHG. ORG 473Back to index gene encodes a lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase (LYP) which acts as a negative regulator of T cell signaling. The impaired function of PTPN22 in T cells may induce the production of autoantibodies and leading to develop ment of autoimmune diseases. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism on the predisposition to AA. Materials and Methods: The present study analyzed the genotype distributi on and allele frequency for the C1858T polymorphism using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP) tech nique in 190 AA patients and 161 healthy individuals.

26802,"Aplastic anemia is a rare blood disease with poor prognosis. It is difficult to distinguish from myelodisplastic syndrome using conventional laboratory blood tests. Bone marrow cytogenetic studies may have an advantage for discriminating the former from the later one. During the past five years, we examined bone marrow and blood specimens derived from over 300 blood cancer patients. Here, we report three cases with rare chromosomal aberrations. A 27 years old female presented with thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia and her chromosomal analysis showed 46 XX and 47, XX, + 21 for blood and bone marrow respectively. A 25 years old female manifested initial diagnosis of anaplastic lym phoma and pancytopenia. Cytogenetic study revealed 46 XX for blood and 46,XX,t(1;2)(p21.1;p12)[18]\46,XX,t(2;8;11)(p22;p23.2;q24.2)[14]\46,XX,t(4;8)(p32;q24.3)[4]/46,XX,t(13;18)(q11.2~q13: p11.3)[8] for bone marrow.

We report an infant with motor delay, dysmorphic features, hypotonia and enlarged cisterna magna with both deletion and du plication segments in 6q25 >q26.Materials and Methods: CMA was performed on the proband using Agilent Technologies 4x180K SurePrint G3 Human CGH+SNP Platform and Cyto genomics 2.5 software. High resolution G banding was carried out on sti mulated lymphocytes cultures. Targeted FISH was done using RP11 43B19, RP11 1112G6 and RP11 455I14 BAC probes. Parental FISH and chromoso me analysis were also performed. Results: CMA on the proband revealed a pathogenic loss of 3.11Mb at 6q25.3 (hg19:157,261,472 160,368,328). This deletion affects 16 OMIM including ARID1B, SEREC1, GTF1H5, SOD2 and ACAT2. CMA also showed a loss of 0.48Mb at 6q25.3q26 (hg19:160,800,432 161,284,434) and a gain of 3.75Mb at 6q25.1q25.3 (hg19:152,046,289 155,794,132), which are of un certain clinical significance. Chromosome analysis showed a female karyoty pe with a derivative chromosome 6 resulting from a deletion of 6q25.3 >q26 and a duplication of 6q25.1 >q25.3. Metaphase FISH with RP11 43B19 and RP11 1112G6 showed deleted signals while RP11 455I14 showed duplica ted signals on the same derivative 6. No apparent abnormality was found in both parents. Conclusions: Interstitial deletions in 6q25 have been associated with micro cephaly, developmental delay, dysmorphic features, hearing loss and agene sis of the corpus callosum. However, the clinical significance of the 0.484Mb loss and 3.74Mb gain are unclear. This case demonstrated the usefulness of FISH and karyotyping in elucidating the complex chromosomal rearran gement. FISH is also a cost effective way to determine if the abnormality is inherited.

26804,"Introduction: Ionizing radiation (IR) generates cellular damage through the interaction with DNA where the energy transfer induces structural breaks. The nonhomologous DNA end joining repair can originate chromosomal stable translocations. Periconceptional exposure to high dose of IR usually results in abortion, and lower doses, could be related to de development of congenital malformations. Materials and Methods. We present a 28 years old patient, born in Romania in 1986, 800 Km from Chernobil. She has hypernasal speech and mild dys praxia. She has had three spontaneous abortions before the 6 th gestational week. Parents are non related. Her father has been diagnosed of hairy cell leukaemia, BRAF positive at 53 years of age. Results: The peripheral blood karyotype revealed a complex chromoso me rearrangement that required six double strand breaks: 46,XX, inv(1) (q23:q32);del(2)(q33 q35);der(18)der(14),t(2;18;14)(18pter q21.3::2q32 q35::14q23 qter) (14pter q23::18q21 qter). Array CGH at 60K resolution was normal, showing no gain or losses. The mother has an inversion in the log arm of on chromosome 1, and her fatherÃÂ´s karyotype is normal. FISH based genomic translocations frequency adjusted for her individual charac teristics, once the constitutional translocations are excluded, is normal. Conclusions. The patient was conceived in the aftermath of the Chernobil nuclear accident. Her peripheral blood shows chromosomal rearrangement, which points to a single event occurring early in the development. The pro bability of the appearance of the rearrangement due to three independent events is 4.2x10 12. In addition, her father has a rare form of leukaemia that has been also related to exposure of ionizing radiation. E",2016

Here, we report three RPL cases with negative family history of RPL, normal clinical examination, normal Thrombophilic genetic testing, normal Hormo nal and Spermogram analysis and rare chromosomal aberrations. A non consanguineous couple (female 37 and male 39 years old) with hi story of RPL, presented to our center. The female experienced four time ab ortion, three unsuccessful IVF and two unproductive IUI. Cytogenetic study ascertained 46,XY,t(1;9)(q11;q11) and 46, XX, normal female. These chro mosomal regions have significant impact on zygote formation as well as re current abortions. In addition, this result has not been previously reported in any couple with recurrent abortions. A consanguineous couple (female 34 and male 34 years old) with a history of three time first trimester abortion were investigated. Cytogenetic study identified 46,XY,t(6;18)(q16;q11) and 46, XX, normal female.

The assessment of chimerism, the ratio of donor to recipient cells, is important for monitoring the engraftment of donor cells and deter mining the recurrence of the original disease after BMT . The aim of this stu dy is to monitor the proportion of host and recipient cells in sex mismatched BMT using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).Materials and Methods: A total of 856 bone marrow or peripheral blood specimens were received from 170 BMT patients which were HLA matched or partially mismatched, but had sex mismatched donors at Ramathibodi hospital between January 2011 and December 2015. Interphase FISH ana lysis using dual color X/Y probes with 500 interphase nuclei were scored. Results: A total of 170 cases were diagnosed as malignant hematologic dis orders (n,147), thalassemia (n,15), anemia (n,3) and others, such as Gau cher disease, neuroblastoma, adrenoleukodystrophy (n,5).

Multiple manufacturers have added HRM capabilities to their thermocyclers. The HRM based NovalleleÃ¢ÂÂ¢ genotyping assays (Canon BioMedical) for research were developed using the CFX384 TouchÃ¢ÂÂ¢ (Bio Rad). Our data demonstra te that carefully designed and optimized HRM assays are easily transferred between different thermocyclers, expanding the utility of these assays and HRM analysis as a method. Materials and methods: We compared the performance of six small ampli con and six unlabeled probe Novallele genotyping assays using three dif ferent HRM enabled thermocyclers. Assay performance, including PCR ro bustness and genotyping reliability, was determined for the CFX384 Touch, LightCyclerÃÂ® 480 (Roche) and Rotor GeneÃÂ® Q (QIAGENÃÂ®) instruments. Both genomic DNA and synthetic constructs were tested, and the data were analyzed using the HRM analysis software for each respective instrument. Results: All 12 assays were able to detect mutations using the different instruments. The PCR amplification and melting temperature difference between the normal and mutated amplicons was maintained across the in struments. For four of the assays, minor optimization of either an annealing temperature by Ã¢ÂÂ¤1.5ÃÂ°C or a change of cycle number by +5 cycles resulted in slightly improved performance.

26816,"Background: fetal RHD genotyping is an innovative and non invasive me thod to assess the risk of fetuseÃ¢ÂÂs hemolytic disease of anti D allo immuni zed pregnant woman. Patient/method: the commercial kit J BoyÃÂ® for genotyping has been tested in the laboratory of Lyon GHE: exon 5, 7, and 10 are amplified real time by PCR using TAQMan technology. A maizeÃ¢ÂÂs DNA is included as internal control. The most important parameters of the method (both sensibility and the specificity) have been tested, checked and verified: the negative predictive value, detection of new variant forms of the RHD gene. Genotyping results of pregnant women have been compared with RH1 phenotype at birth. The correlation study has allowed to establish the interpretation criteria. The residual risk analysis has allowed to understand the actual limitation of the method due to the low concentration of fetal DNA in the maternal plasma and to define criteria of biological interpretation: the negative re sult must be confirmed by getting the same result on another sample a few weeks later. Conclusion: This commercial kit very easy to use but several samples must be analysed simultaneously to reduce the unit cost for each test. E",2016
26817,"The new Agilent 4200 TapeStation system provides automated, fast, and re liable DNA and RNA electrophoresis for up to 96 samples using prepackaged reagents and minimal manual handling. The Agilent D5000 ScreenTape and High Sensitivity D5000 ScreenTape assays have been developed for the se paration and analysis of DNA fragments from 100 bp to 5,000 bp, a size range that complements and resides between the Agi lent D1000 ScreenTape and the Genomic DNA ScreenTape assays. The 4200 TapeStation system and the DNA ScreenTape assays can be used at several steps of the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflow. With the emergence of methodo logies, such as the use of Transposomes, NGS library sizes are tending to increase beyond 1,000 bp, even for the short read NGS technologies. This Poster focuses on the performance of both D5000 ScreenTape assays with respect to the accuracy and precision of quantification and sizing, as well as the sensitivity of these assays. Data analysis for quantification and molarity determination was compared against the corresponding assay for the Agi lent 2100 Bioanalyzer system.

Sali va is considered to represent an ultra filtrate of blood, and thus contains in abundance a huge variety of diagnostically valuable molecules. Apart from being known to contain polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors, saliva is mucous and inhomogenous and thus often difficult to handle. Moreover, its human DNA content is by far lower compared to blood. Here we examined blood derived DNA, salivary DNA and saliva direct to PCR to carry out re liable genotyping based on single plex RealFast and multi plex StripAssays for up to 22 mutations.

26820,"EfremovÃ¢ÂÂ, Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an enzyme of great importance for the metabolism of clinically used drugs. The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic and has the most variations among the CYP450 gene superfamily, with more than 100 variants identified so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the allele distribution of CYP2D6 variants in the Macedonian, Albanian and Romani population. A total of 300 unrelated individuals, 100 individuals from each ethnic group, were geno typed using long range PCR and multiplex single base extension (SNaPshot) method. The most frequent variants and equally distributed in the three analyzed ethnic groups were the fully functional alleles *1 and *2. The most common non functional allele in all ethnic groups was *4, which reached the high est frequency among Albanians (22.5%) and the most common allele with decreÃÂ°sed activity was *41, which was more frequent among Romani (23%) when compared to Macedonians (11%, p,0.002) and Albanians (10.5%, p,0.0012).Among Albanians the percentage of poor metabolizers was 7%, 6% among Romani and 4% among Macedonians. Higher percentage of ultrarapid me tabolizers (UMs) was observed among Macedonians (5%), when compared to the Albanians and Romani (1% in each group).In conclusion, our study showed that CYP2D6 gene locus is highly hetero geneous in the three examined ethnic groups. The prevalence of CYP2D6 allelic variants and genotypes in Macedonia is in accordance with the other European populations. E",2016
26821,"Introduction: Most patient populations show large inter individual variabi lity with respect to drug response and toxicity. This variation can be of phy siological, pathophysiological, environmental or genetic origin. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has high relevance in drug metabolism. CYP2D6 is in volved in the metabolism of 20 25% of clinically used drugs and exhibits a clinically relevant gene polymorphism that modifies the pharmacokinetics of nearly 10% of all drugs. Opiate addiction is one of the most important issues of drug dependence in the forensic toxicology in the world. Most of drug over dose related deaths are caused by opioids such as morphine, co deine, dextromethorphan, ethylmorphine and tramadol. Interestingly, an opiate addict with impaired CYP2D6 enzyme may show unexpected adverse drug reactions towards regular doses compared to controls due to poor me tabolism of drugs. Materials and Methods: In this study, polymorphisms of drug abused post mortem samples and respected controls; CYP2D6*3 (n,38), CYP2D6*4 (n,49), and CYP2D6*6 (n,48)single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have analyzed with TagMan drug metabolism genotyping assay kit by Real Time PCR. Results: The genotype frequencies of CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*6 yielded no significant results for both post mortem subjects compared to control groups. Conclusion: Between people with different ethnic backgrounds the pattern of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and phenotypes differs dramatically. Although we did not obtain a significant result from our data, such studies should be done with larger sample sizes. This study has been supported by Cukurova Research Fund (Adana, Turkey). E",2016
26822,"INTRODUCTION: At present a high percentage of the pharmacological treat ments do not reach the wished benefits, due to the generation of adverse effects or to the lack of effectiveness. This occurs especially in polypharmacy patients. Medication Therapy Management services and pharmacogenetic approach can help to solve and prevent these problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present two kidney transplanted males treated with Tacrolimus as immunosuppressant therapy and with Omepra zole as gastrointestinal prevention. Analyzing results of Medication Therapy Management services, one of them (patient 1) showed fluctuating Tacroli mus levels, gastrointestinal complications and muscular pain. The existence of an interaction between both drugs was suspected. The principal genes involved in the transport and metabolism of these drugs are ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19 and POR, and were studied by PCR RFLP .RESULTS: Genotyping results are shown in the table. A change in antiacid therapy was proposed as solution (substitution of Ome prazole for Rabeprazole), for which there is evidence of lower incidence in its metabolism profile. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacogenetics and Medication Therapy Management services are raising fields that are becoming essential in the pharmaceutical area. Both of them seek to improve drug therapies effectiveness and toxico logical effects.

26824,"Background: Warfarin is the most widely used anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic index. The activity and metabolism of warfarin are regulated by vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) and cytochrome P450 2C9(CYP2C9) genes. Genetic variability of warfarin dosing has been attributed to polymorphisms in these genes. Objective: To investigate the impact of genetic factors on warfarin dosage requirement in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) at the Pulmonary Diseases Department. Methods: The VKORC1 G1639A, C1173T and CYP2C9(*1/*2/*3) allelic va riants were identified by using real time PCR in 17 (8 males and 9 females) patients with PTE. Results: Only 4 patients were found to be normal for VKORC1 mutations, while 3 of them were heterozygous and one was compound heterozygous for CYP2C9. Eight of the remaining 13 patients were homozygous and the other 5 were compound heterozygous for both mutations. CYP2C9 gene was found normal in 4 patients(*1*1), heterozygous mutant in 9 patients(*1*3), compound heterozygous in 2 patients(*2*3) and homozygous mutant in 2 patients(*3*3). There were no wild type genotype for mutations in both ge nes of patients. Warfarin dose was adjusted based on genetic testing results of the patients. Conclusion: VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes can be used to help determine the optimal starting dose of warfarin for patients with PTE. Warfarin dose management should be personalized on the basis of a patientÃ¢ÂÂs genetic pro file. E",2016
26825,"Introduction: First line anti tuberculosis (TB) drugs are responsible for the occurrence of several adverse drug reactions (ADR). Hepatotoxicity is one of most serious ADR and appears soon in the beginning of treatment. Although already known the main mechanisms involved in the development of hepa totoxicity, in Brazil this field is little explored, especially in vulnerable popu lations. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of hepatotoxicity during TB treatment and investigate the associations with genetic polymorphisms, clinical and epidemiological factors, comparing in digenous and non indigenous patients. Material and Methods: Clinical and epidemiological variables, serum levels of liver enzymes and polymorphisms of the genes NAT2, CYP2E1 and GSTM1 were investigated. Non conditional logistic regression was used to identify factors associated to hepatotoxicity. Odds ratio was used as association measure. Results: The incidence of hepatotoxicity was 19.7% for all patients, being 50% more frequent in indigenous (p,0.055). We identified 10 SNPs pre viously described and, in indigenous, one new nonsynonymous SNP of NAT2. 54.6% of patients expressed slow acetylation phenotype profile. The frequency of null genotype of GSTM1 was higher in non indigenous (p,0.002) while no significant differences in relation to polymorphism of CYP2E1 were observed between the groups. Hepatotoxicity was associated to patients older than 60 years old and indigenous (OR,26.0; 95%CI:3.1 217.6; OR,3.8; 95%CI:1.3 11.1, respectively). Furthermore, hepatotoxicity was associated to slow acetylation profile in indigenous patients (OR,10.7; 95%CI:1.2 97.2).

26826,"Background: Several pathogenesis and genetic factors influence predisposi tion to antituberculosis drug induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH) especially for isoniazid (INH). However, the major susceptibility genes for ATDH are N acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). NAT2 gene determines the individualÃ¢ÂÂs acetylator status(fast, intermediate or slow) to metabolize drugs and xenobiotics, while CY P2E1 c1/c1 genotype carriers had an increased risk of ATDH. Polymorphisms of the NAT2 and CYP2E1 genes vary remarkably among the populations of different ethnic origins. The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the frequency of slow acetylators in Moroccan population by genotyping of NAT2 gene vari ants and determining the genotype c1/c1 for CYP2E1 gene, in order to pre dict adverse effects of Tuberculosis treatment, particularly hepatotoxicity. Results: The frequencies of specific NAT2 alleles were 53%, 25%, 2% and 4% for NAT2*5, NAT2*6, NAT2*7 and NAT2*14respectively among 163 Moroccan studied group. Genotyping of CYP2E1 gene, by real time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan probes, re vealed frequencies of 98.5% for c1/c1 and 1.5% for c1/c2 among 130 Mo roccan studied group. Conclusion: The most prevalent genotypes of NAT2 gene in Moroccans are those which encode slow acetylation phenotype (72.39%), leading to a high risk of ATDH. Most Moroccans are homozygous for c1 allele of CYP2E1 gene which aggravates hepatotoxicity in slow acetylators. This genetic background should be taken into account in determining the minimum dose of INH needed to treatMoroccan TB patients, in order to decrease adverse effects. E",2016

In this study, cytotoxic effects of the drugs were annihilated by the combined use of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (Zebularine). Then, the regulation of ge nes related to apoptotic pathway in breast cancer was studied epigenetically. MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell line was grown by culturing of cells. Drug doses were determined by MTT assay. Survival assays showed that the drugs decrease the cell viability. Colony sizes created by the cells were examined by colony formation assay and soft agar colony formation assay and found out that drugs prevent the cell growth. DNA was insulated from cells which were drugged, then bisulphite modification was made and state of methyla tion of TP53, caspase 9, caspase 8 and caspase 3 genes were analysed by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP). Methylation changes in the aforesaid genes gave significant results.

26830,"Cervical cancer is tightly connected to HPV infection, but it is not yet elu cidated why some of infected cases progress to cancer, but others not. Our aim was to study the role of DNA methylation in this process by analyzing HPV infected cervical tissues from different PAP groups. We measured unmethylated and hypermethylated fraction in promoters of 22 genes, connected to cellular stress and toxicity by real time PCR in three groups: (i) 10 HPV positive PAP I/II cervical samples; (ii) 10 HPV positive PAP III/IV cervical samples; (iii) 10 healthy blood donors. Overall, there was an increased average hypermethylated fraction (Fhm) for all investigated genes in cervical groups compared to controls. The highly methylated genes were DNAJC15 (Fhm 31% and 32% vs 0.6% in controls), BRCA1 (29% and 13% vs. 0.8%), Tp53 (19.5% and 19.2% vs 0.8%), Gpx3 (13% and 16% vs 1.3%), ATM (11% and 15% vs 0.7%), CSTB (11% and 13% vs 0.3%) and Prdx2 (11.7% and 11.6% vs 0.5%). Comparison between high grade and low grade lesions found an increase in Fhm of more than 1.5 times for the genes Msh2 (3 times), Rara (2.1 times), Gadd45G (1.7 times), SCARA3 (1.6 times) and Mlh1 (1.5 times).We suggest an association between HPV infection and hypermethylation (inactivation) of important tumor suppressor genes and genes, connected to cellular stress.

Introduction:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes of a subset of DNA methyltransferases and global DNA methylation level in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC ) and the trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons in formalin induced orofacial pain. Materials and Methods: Adult rats were injected with 50 uL of 2.5% v/v formalin subcutaneously into upper lip and consequent facial grooming behavior was monitored. All animal studies conformed to the Guidelines of International Association for the study of Pain regarding investigations. The levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b were measured in nuclear extracts of the ACC and the TG neurons using DNMTs assay kits (Abcam); Genomic DNA was isolated from ACC and TG neurons using DNA isolation universal kit (Zymo Research) and Global DNA methylation was measured using the Methylated DNA Quantification Kit (abcam) in 1,5 hours after formalin in jection. Results:The 5 methylcytosine levels in rat genomic DNA obtained from the TG and the ACC neurons were decreased in the study group compared with the control group. No significant differences in global methylation level bet ween the TG and the ACC were observed. In addition, DNMT3a and DNMT3b were overexpressed in nuclear extracts of the TG and the ACC neurons from rats with formalin induced pain compared with control sample, whereas slight increase in DNMT1 levels was detected in study group. Conclusions:The results demonstrate that changes in global DNA methylati on are correlated with DNMT3a/b levels and these epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in the development and continuation of chronic pain.

Within these study cord blood samples of 996 children and for a subsample also placenta and mothersÃ¢ÂÂ DNA samples have been collected. Different me tabolic and psychiatric phenotypes were assessed for the mothers including type 1 diabetes, hypertension, BMI, anxiety and depression rating scales. 996 cord blood samples were genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpressE xome Array and DNA methylation levels were assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We focused on the polygenic risk score derived from Arloth et al. (1) who showed that SNPs that alter the initial transcriptome response to glucocor ticoid receptor activation also increase the risk for stress related psychiatric disorders. We ran an interaction analysis between this risk score and maternal stress on methylation. Results: analysis is still ongoing at the moment of abstract submission. We aim to identify methylation sites which are modulated by both genetic and environmental factors.

Results indicate a significantly increased miR 21(n fold,5.27 16.48) and miR 133 (n fold ,0.40 56.82) expression in papillary thyroid cancer subjects (P<0.001). Moreover, we observed that miR133a presented the highest expression le vel in papillary thyroid cancer follicular variant, whereas miR 21 displayed a high expression in papillary thyroid cancer follicular variant, but also in sclerosing variant. The study presented a characteristic pattern for studied miRNAs gene ex pression in different thyroid cancer types, raising the possibility to establish specific biomarkers. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to establish the relationship between miRNAs expression and papillary thyroid carci noma variants. Acknowledgments to PCCA 135/2012 E",2016

Background: Primary distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a rare genetic condition characterized by an impaired acid excretion by the intercalated cells in the renal collecting duct. Recessive forms of this disease are caused by mutations in tow major genes: ATP6V1B1 and ATP6V0A4. Causal muta tions in ATP6V1B1 gene are classically associated with early sensorineural hearing loss, however cases of tubular acidosis with early deafness have also been described in patients with mutations in the ATP6V0A4 gene. Methods: The phenotype and genotype of three Moroccan consanguineous families with dRTA and deafness were assessed. Molecular analysis was per formed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of exon 12 of ATP6V1B1 gene. Results: A novel c.1169dupC frameshift mutation of ATP6V1B1 gene was identified in one family and the c.1155dupC North African mutation in the tow other families. Discussion and conclusion In this report, we propose first line genetic te sting based on screening of these two mutations both located in exon 12 of ATP6V1B1 gene in Moroccan patients with recessive form of dRTA associe ted to precocious hearing loss. Molecular diagnosis of dRTA leads to appro priate treatment and prevention of renal failure in affected individuals and to provide genetic counseling for families at risk. E",2016
26836,"National newborn screening (NBS) program for CF was introduced all over Russia in January 2007 (in Moscow June 2006). Currently, this is the main method of CF diagnosis in the country. WeÃ¢ÂÂve analyzed the data of all CF patients from the Moscow region CF Pati entsÃ¢ÂÂ Register that were diagnosed before 18 years of age. The CF patients were divided into two groups according to the different time periods: from 1999 to 2005 Group I 83 CF patients (before the introduction of NBS in Moscow) and from 2007 to 2013 Group II 228 CF patients (after the in troduction of NBS).The average age of diagnosis in Group I was 4.5 years (30% before 12 months), and in Group II 1.8 years (74% before 12 months). The average age of CF diagnosis in the positive NBS group was 2.3 months, in the infants with false negative NBS results 23 months. In Group I meconium ileus (MI) was diagnosed in 5 children (6%), and in group II in 27 children (12%).We assume there were much more cases of CF under diagnosis in MI new borns before 2007. MI patients in Group I were diagnosed as having CF at the age of 1.4 years, and in Group II 1.7 months. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of NBS program. At the same time, underdiagnosed CF before NBS, false negative results of NBS as well as some problems in the CF care still influence the diagnosis age of CF patients. E",2016

The spectrum and frequency of CFTR mutations varies considerably in different ethnic groups and geographical regions. The aim: to study the frequency of CFTR mutations in Karachay Cherkess Republic, the region of compact residence of four small peoples: Karachay, Cherkess, Abaza, Nogai. Methods: The analysis of 12 common in Russia CFTR mutations was per formed in 653 healthy unrelated individuals from 7 districts and Cherkessk city, representing four ethnic groups, by multiplexPCR and restriction ana lysis. Results: Two carriers of 1677delTA mutation (0.003) and 6 carriers of W1282X mutation (0.01) in 300 Karachay; two 1677delTA carriers (0.01) and two F508del carriers (0.01) in 103 Cherkess; three 1677delTA carriers (0.012), one W1282X carrier (0.004) and one carrier of F508del (0.004) in 128 Abaza and three W1282X carriers (0.012) in 122 Nogai were revealed. Conclusion: In each of the sample from different ethnic groups, the cumula tive frequency of detected CFTR mutations was greater than 0.01, thus the CF incidence should be at least 1 in 10000. The 1677delta mutation is wi despread among CF patients, related to the people of North Caucasus (Che chens, Ingushs) and Transcaucasia (Georgians). We found 1677delta muta tion in Karachay, Abaza and Cherkess that are autochthonous ethnic groups of the North Caucasian region of Russia, and not discovered for Nogai with a more short history of residence on this territory (since XIV century AD).

Introduction: The c. 23+1G>A (IVS1+1G>A) splice site mutation is one of the most frequent mutations of GJB2 gene (MIM 121011) in patients with congenital deafness in some populations of Eastern Europe, Caucasus, Middle East, Central and South Asia, Southern and Eastern Siberia. In recent study, we provided evidence that high prevalence of this splice site mutation among Yakut population isolate in Eastern Siberia is due to common foun der effect [Barashkov et al., 2011]. The aim of this study is to investigate the origin of the c. 23+1G>A mutation found in some Siberian and Caucasian (Russian) populations. Materials and methods: DNA samples of four deaf patients with c. 23+1G>A mutation (GJB2) in homozygous state representing several ethnic Eurasian populations (Yakut, Russian, Tuvinian and Evenk) were genotyped with Illu mina 730K SNP array according to manufacturersÃ¢ÂÂ specifications (Estonian Biocentre, Tartu).Results: The presence of extended homozygous region (from ~1.4 Mb in Russian to ~7.6 Mb in Tuvinian) was shown for all studied patients. Moreo ver, we have found identical, common for all studied individuals, homozygo sity track (~325 kb) flanking the region of c. 23+1G>A mutation. Conclusions: Thus, the results of the genome wide analysis support the hy pothesis of a common origin of the c. 23+1G>A splice site mutation (GJB2) in certain populations of Eurasia.

This haplogroup has been difficult to subdivide based on the hypervariable segments I and II (HVS I and II) variation alone. In Russians, a number of major clades within haplo group H were revealed on the basis of high resolution mtDNA analysis (i.e. HVS I and II sequencing combined with analysis of some subhaplogroup specific coding region sites) clades H1a, H1b, H2, H4, H5, H6, H7 and H11. However, complete mtDNA analysis at higher levels of phylogenetic reso lution allows revealing more than 100 distinct clades within haplogroup H. Therefore, to resolve the phylogeny of this haplogroup in Russians, we sequenced 118 complete H mitogenomes of Russian individuals from nor thwestern (Pskov and Velikij Novgorod) and southwestern (Belgorod, Orel and Tula) regions of European part of the Russian Federation. Phylogene tic analysis has shown that the largest subclades in Russians are H1 (about 30% of haplogroup H pool, with lineages H1*, H1a, H1b, H1c, H1n, H1aj), H5 (about 16%, with lineages H5a, H5b, H5e, H5f, H5u), and H11 (about 10%, with lineages H11a1 and H11a2).

Several genes, such as ACTN4, CD2AP , INF2, NPHS2 and TRPC6, have been identi fied as a cause of autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Alpha actinin 4, encoded ACTN4 gene, is a member of the spectrin gene superfamily that crosslinks F actin filaments. It is nonmuscle isoform ex pressed in many human tissues. The structure is head to tail antiparallel homodimer with three main parts. N terminal domain is composed of two calponin homologous domains with actin binding sites followed by four spectrin repeats. C terminal domain consists of two EF hand domains that can bind Ca2+ ions. Our patient was thirty two years old man from Italy, now living in the Czech Republic, with positive family history (mother) suffering from focal segmen tal glomerulosclerosis who was after renal transplantation. We screened for mutations in genes ACTN4, INF2, NPHS2 and TRP6 using Sanger sequencing. We identified a novel substitution Leu169Pro in the ACTN4 gene that was in the heterozygous state. According to prediction programs PolyPhen 2 and Mutational Taster this substitution has got the high probability to be casual. We also screened for the new substitution in healthy close relatives (father and brothers) but they are carriers of the wild type sequence.

Symptom varies epilepsy, head ache, vomiting, hard of hearing, mental disorder, short stature, stroke and so on. Affected pregnant women should be monitored for diabetes mellitus and respiratory insufficiency, which may require therapeutic interventions. We experienced a case of pregnancy with MELAS. [Case] 36 y/o para 0 gravida 0 woman, who is 144cm in height and has a hard of hearing from 30 y/o, conceived by IVF ET after 9 years infertility and came to our hospital at 9 weeks. At 21 weeks, she suddenly complained headache and dysarthria. Left temporal lobe edema and cerebellum atro phy were observed in MRI. The next day, she had strong uterine contraction which led a miscarriage. One month later, she visited our genetic clinic for asking about some influences to next pregnancy.[Discussion] MELAS is inheritable from mother by 100%. However per meability is various. The mother of this case has only hard of hearing. The women with genetic disease sometimes confront with complications during pregnancy due to physiological changes. Possibility of prenatal diagnosis is important information, however prenatal diagnosis of MELAS is impossible.[Conclusion] Parental genetic counseling is important for women with any genetic disease before pregnancy.

We report the case of a 6 year old female patient with a history of surgery for syndactyly of the hands and feet, who was admitted to a ped iatric intensive care unit following cardiac arrest. The ECG showed a long QT interval that on occasions reached 500 ms and a wide T wave. Despite the absence of facial dysmorphism and the presence of normal psychomotor development, a diagnosis of Timothy syndrome was made given the associa tion of Syndactyly and the electrocardiogram features. Sanger sequencing of the CACNA1C gene, followed by sequencing of the genes KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, KCNE2, were negative. The subsequent analysis of a panel of genes responsible for hereditary cardiac rhythm disorders using Haloplex tech nology revealed a recurrent mosaic p.

Results: Allele frequencies (5 HTTLPR L:0.56, S:0.44; rs25531 A:0.95, G:0.05) were similar to those previously reported for European populations and genotype distributions were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (P,0.866 and P,0.431, respectively). When considering individuals exposed to adver se CE a grading tendency towards ASB was observed in carriers of S alleles. Linear regression analysis yielded near significant association (P,0.05) bet ween the S allele and ASB in males. By contrast, in the group not exposed to adverse CE, individuals homozygous for the L allele were more prone to commit ASB. The L allele was found significantly associated (P,0.01) with ASB when testing all subjects. Conclusions: The findings showing that the S allele carriers are more vul nerable to childhood negative environments for ASB outcomes and profit more from positive environmental conditions support the hypothesis that 5 HTTLPR is a genetic marker of differential susceptibility.

We have performed study of fertility of deaf people living in Eastern Siberia in comparison with their hearing siblings. Fertility was determined as the average number of children born to examined groups, genetic fitness of deaf people was cal culated as the ratio of the overall fertility of deaf individuals to their hea ring siblings [Blanton et al., 2010]. Data on fertility of 83 deaf people (fe males 53, males 30) and 185 hearing siblings (females 88, males 97) aged 35 69 years were collected: deaf individuals have in total 143 children, whereas hearing siblings 422 children. Fertility of deaf people was 1.72 vs 2.28 of their hearing siblings, genetic fitness for deaf individuals was 0.75. There was no difference between genders. Our results are comparable with fitness of deaf women in Sweden 0.76 [Carlsson et al., 2005], lower than in USA 0.88 [Blanton et al., 2010], and higher than in Mongolia 0.62 [Te kin et al., 2010].

26854," Historically, healthcare and health information were delivered through trai ned medical professionals, who also recommended actions for patients to follow (e.g. undergo further tests, take a prescribed medication, etc.). Pati ents had some autonomy of choice, but in todayÃ¢ÂÂs digital age, patients have become increasingly empowered to take charge of their health. One example is direct to consumer genetic testing (DTCGT). It has a clear public demand, but it has received a decidedly mixed reaction in the medical community. Despite significant concerns from medical professionals and researchers, research on DTCGT has not supported the misperceptions and other con cerns. As a genetic counselor working in the DTCGT industry, I support the publicÃ¢ÂÂs right to access personal genetic information when it is delivered in a responsible manner. Key components and principles of any DTCGT com pany should include respect for consumer rights and privacy; reports writ ten at an appropriate comprehension level; educational content to support consumers; valid test methods; and compliance with the local regulatory framework. With these in place, research supports consumers ability to comprehend their personal genetic information without evidence of psy chological harm. However, the DTCGT industry is well served to include me dical professionals in its ranks. Although supporting consumers of DTCGT is very different from direct patient care, having the clinical experience to create needed resources, identify and correct for potential misperceptions among patients and create key information needed by medical professio nals to effectively utilize genetic test information in patient care ultimately lead to better services. Finally, data suggests that physicians are ill prepared to deal with DTCGT results presented by their patients and that their lack of preparedness may have a negative impact on the patient physician re lationship. DTCGT companies are working to engage and educate medical professionals; an evidence based assessment and greater acceptance by the medical professional community is also needed.",2016
26855,"Patient empowerment has become a buzzword. It is used to support a great variety of practices ranging from shared decision making in the clinic to self experimentation of Ã¢ÂÂcitizen scientistsÃ¢ÂÂ. In the domain of DTC genetics, the argument of patient empowerment has been used to support the idea that patients should have direct access to genetic risk information, without the involvement of health professionals. The empowerment rhetoric allows the labeling of those who oppose such ideas as paternalistic empowerment skeptics. This paper seeks to make the of the cultural and political meanings of empowerment more explicit. It suggests that these meanings are consi dered explicitly when analysing the societal and ethical aspects of DTC ge netics. Drawing upon the work of Luca Chiapperino and others, I distinguish between three traditions of meaning of empowerment: (1) Empowerment as an expression of individual autonomy and choice (individualistic empo werment); (2) empowerment as liberation from paternalism and oppressi on (emancipatory empowerment), and (3) empowerment in the service of democraticisation and deliberation (democratic empowerment). Differentia ting between different calls for empowerment on the basis of its underlying political, economical and ethical goals, values, and assumptions helps us to avoid unduly simplistic and binary assessments of whether or not a parti cular technological practice empowers or disempowers patients. Instead it enables us to carry out a systematic analysis of how technological practices are involved in shifting power between different actors. Applying such an analysis on the field of DTC genetics shows, for example, the great extent to which battles for increasing access to information for patients also enable the types of work that patients are increasingly expected to do in order to make personalised and precision medicine possible.

26858,"BACKGROUND: Health professionalsÃ¢ÂÂ ability to incorporate genomics in practice has been recognised as a barrier to the use of genomics. Building this capability requires more than education alone. As part of a broad clini cally driven program to implement genomics, we aimed to build cliniciansÃ¢ÂÂ capability by providing them with the opportunity to gain experience of te sting patients. CliniciansÃ¢ÂÂ views on the impact of their participation and on future service delivery were collected. METHODS: Clinicians offered testing to >300 patients within a demonstra tion project in Melbourne, Australia. Semi structured interviews were con ducted with 4 genetic counsellors, 14 geneticists and 14 other medical spe cialists (n , 32) participating in the demonstration project; interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Genetic and other practitioners reported that participating in the demonstration project gave them new insights into how and when to use ge nomic testing and the changes necessary to support its use in practice. The Ã¢ÂÂhands onÃ¢ÂÂ learning experience provided by multidisciplinary variant inter pretation meetings was particularly valued. Perspectives on future service delivery encompassed processes for patient selection, variant interpretati on and clinic organisation. Results for each will be presented.

To explore patient understanding of and concerns about testing, patients were survey ed after a standard length genetic counselling session (<60mins), but before receipt of test results. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse scales and item lists. Content analysis was used for open ended questions. RESULTS: To date 62% (179/287) have responded.

26861,"Introduction: The current generally accepted model of genetic counselling is based on a person centred approach. Although more emphasis is now placed on cultural competency for genetic counsellors, practice still incorporates a predominantly Western perspective. For this, and a number of historical re asons, there is a lack of confidence and participation in healthcare services by MÃÂori in New Zealand. We worked with one whÃÂnau with a CDH1 muta tion to address problems with patient engagement and develop a stronger relationship between MÃÂori and the genetics service. Method: This case study provides the opportunity to explore the evolution of a Ã¢ÂÂwhÃÂnau centredÃ¢ÂÂ approach to genetic counselling working with MÃÂori in New Zealand. A person centred, western model of genetic counselling in cludes a focus on individual autonomy and informed consent. In contrast many MÃÂori still hold a collectivist notion of the self, and healthcare decisi ons are made as a group. By incorporating results of discussions with MÃÂori elders and using the unique MÃÂori health perspectives we developed a mu tually agreed upon process of Ã¢ÂÂWhÃÂnau focusedÃ¢ÂÂ counselling. Results: By incorporating the MÃÂori health elements of spiritual, psychologi cal, physical and family into genetic counselling a respectful and reciprocal relationship has been established which has resulted in increased uptake of predictive testing. The positive outcomes of this process demonstrate the importance of building strong relationships with different cultural groups. This is a vital aspect of Genetic Counselling and will become increasingly so as genomics leads to more complex information and implications for indivi duals and whÃÂnau.

However they are unsure about what to say, when to say it, and are concerned about their child(ren)Ã¢ÂÂs reaction. As a result, children may be given little or no information and they may be afraid of upsetting their parents by asking. The silence that occurs around the IGC can be detrimental to the long term mental health and well being of parents and children. Methods: To facilitate better family communication about the IGC, we co de signed a therapeutic intervention based on Multi Family Discussion Groups (MFDG) used in systemic family therapy. To inform the interventionÃ¢ÂÂs deve lopment, a series of focus groups for parents, children, young people and ge netic counsellors were held. Genetic counsellors were subsequently trained in the interventionÃ¢ÂÂs delivery. Findings: Training in the MFDG can extend the genetic counsellors role in delivering this intervention. Families and genetic counsellors considered MFDG important for facilitating family communication. Most parents and their children thought families with similar IGC but not necessarily the same should attend the MFDG so that they could relate to and learn from each otherÃ¢ÂÂs experiences. The sessions should be welcoming environments that simultaneously facilitate involvement in group activities but also provide distraction from the emotionally challenging subject matter.

Research exploring childrenÃ¢ÂÂs understanding of heredity and the most adequate approach of genetic mechanisms for them is scarce. The main objective of this research was to explore childrenÃ¢ÂÂs perception of heredity; specifically, we wanted to clarify how children un derstand heredity and what theories they use in order to understand va rious genetic mechanisms. Methods: We collected data using semi structured interviews with 20 child ren (11 to 13 years old). The interview was based on 17 questions aimed at exploring their understanding and explanations of heredity. Responses were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. A 3 year follow up was conducted in order to investigate the dynamic and potential changes in their understanding of heredity and genetic mechanisms. Results: Following thematic analysis three main themes emerged: (1) infer red mechanisms, (2) inheritance, and (3) misconceptions. Overall, children in this age group have a number of naive theories and mix accurate scientific knowledge with misconceptions, but their general understanding of here dity is rather fair. Sub themes and specific examples, as well as longitudinal changes in terms of knowledge dynamic are presented. Discussion: Children have a good understanding of heredity which they in tegrate in the construct of kinship, though without being able to detail the mechanisms underlying them.

We reviewed 1,330 records of consultands who requested presymptomatic testing at our centre. Their social demographic profile was similar to those in other international programs. Mean age at the time of testing was 30.5 years; females (55.7%) predominated; 60.5% consultands had no offspring; and 61.4% were non carriers. Contrarily to other international reports, withdrawals before results disclosure were only about 15%. Among the reasons for uptaking PST , the most common were: relieving uncertainty (41.7%); preparing for the disease onset (23.2%); family planning (23.20); and informing their offspring (18.0%).Lessons from our practice along these 20 years point out to the need for har monization of our registers of counselling sessions, as well as the relevance of a more qualitative approach to document the consultandsÃ¢ÂÂ experiences.

Method: A working group of representatives from laboratory genetics, me dical genetics and genetic counselling from partner organisations was con vened to develop the consent form. Consensus was reached on key elements of the form, following review of literature and selected local and internatio nal clinical consent forms for exome sequencing. Early consumer input was achieved through the Melbourne Genomics Community Advisory Group. The documents were refined over 10 months and subjected to independent legal review. Outcomes and conclusion: The outcome was a single page consent form for singleton or trio analysis supported by a series of information sheets descri bing genomic sequencing and providing an explanation of the points that patients agree to in the consent form. To date, the consent form has been adopted by two Alliance laboratories and one clinical department and will be used to consent more than 500 patients from five hospitals over the next two years.

Here we report the results from an empirical study exploring the challenge these results pose to the consent process. Methods: In depth interviews were undertaken with 32 health care profes sionals (HCPs) and 16 patients to explore views about consent and disclos ure practices with genomic tests and in particular IFs. These were analysed thematically. Results: Both groups: 1. Agreed that patients should be asked and given choices about the results they wish to receive2. Realised that discrete choices were not possible since the range of possib le findings was too great 3. Wanted clinical judgement to play an important role in disclosure, and were satisfied when this had been superimposed on unclear consent4. Concluded that broad rather than specific consent was the only type of real consent possible but had concerns about how this could be applied in practiceConclusions: Placing all choices at the consent to testing stage is neither practical nor desirable.

Results: Some parents reported changes in attitudes toward disclosure of certain findings while waiting for results, but none expressed a desire to modify choices for unsolicited findings (UFs) or to revoke their decision for WES. Parents received different types of results or combinations thereof: primary results and/or UFs some results were of unclear significance.

Materials and Methods: this presentation provides an ethical analysis of professionalsÃ¢ÂÂ and patientsÃ¢ÂÂ responsibilities towards family members at risk for curable or preventable genetic diseases. Arguments from different ethi cal perspectives will be identified and critically evaluated. Results: the duty to warn is equally demanding to genetic professionals and patients. Yet professionals have conflicting duties such as patient confiden tiality. Responsibilities that arise within a family do not play an important role in contemporary medical practice, but the current debate on unsoli cited findings draws the attention towards the patient as moral agent co responsible for his childrenÃ¢ÂÂs and siblingsÃ¢ÂÂ health. Conclusion: there is a moral basis for the claim that both patients and pro fessionals have a duty to warn relatives that are at risk for hereditary di seases . New strategies for genetic disclosure as a shared responsibility are needed. In order to achieve this, IT applications may provide a valuable con tribution.

26873,"Pediatric biobanks facilitate research, which is considered important for improving (pediatric) health care by generating biomedical knowledge. However, pediatric biobank research gives rise to specific ethical issues. At the time of inclusion, many children cannot, or are legally not allowed to, consent for themselves, and typically parental permission is required. Samples may still be stored and used by biobanks when children become autonomous adults. The question arises whether children should be re contacted to obtain their own consent, or give the opportunity to withdraw their samples, when they reach adulthood. Major guidelines do not provide sufficient guidance on re contact and consent, and there is only very limited literature that analyses the issue in depth. Given the fact that biobanks alrea dy include pediatric samples, and in light of the rapid developments in bio bank research, it is important to address the issue of re contact and consent now. We discuss arguments in favor and against re contacting participants at maturity and examine different re contact policies that can be considered, ranging from a thin opt out policy (participants can withdraw their samp les, but the biobank does not re contact the participant) to a strict opt in (samples will be destroyed when participants do not give their consent). We suggest that biobanks adopt a thick opt out as the default re contact policy, which means that biobanks re contact children at maturity and give them the opportunity to withdraw their samples.",2016
26874,"The rapid introduction of genetic technologies in medicine is creating new information that can have implications for patientsÃ¢ÂÂ and familiesÃ¢ÂÂ health, reproductive decisions, lifestyle choices, employment, and psychosocial wellbeing. Do healthcare professionals, such as clinical genetics specialists, have a responsibility or duty to re contact former patients to communicate this new information? There is no professional consensus about whether and how re contacting should happen. There is also limited empirical evi dence concerning the perspectives of healthcare professionals and patients. We conducted interviews with over 30 healthcare professionals from clini cal genetics, and other specialties potentially involved in re contacting. Re contact does take place, but generally in an ad hoc fashion, e.g. when clinicians happen to review a file for other reasons. Decisions about whe ther and how to re contact were based on the specific patient and/or family, and the perceived utility of the result. Whilst there was uncertainty about whether more systematic re contacting processes should be implemented, the need for a professional debate to agree in what situations re contacting should be considered good standard of practice was highlighted. Some re spondents argued that the creation of re contact guidelines may help clini cal services to be allocated more resources. Others argued that this might create a legal obligation to re contact thereby using up scarce resources. To determine whether guidelines would be useful, more empirical evidence is needed. To this aim, we will also explore the experiences and expectations of patients and other stakeholders, such as support groups.

26875,"Genome wide sequencing has been performed on a research basis for sever al years and now clinical diagnostic services based on these technologies are increasingly requested. Incidental findings are identified in 1 2% of tested individuals undergoing whole exome sequencing. The question of which in cidental findings to return to patients has generated much discussion inclu ding formal position statements in Canada, the USA and Europe. While most agree that actionable findings should be offered to all competent adults, the discussion becomes more complex for paediatric patients with a number of organizations recommending reporting back incidental findings actio nable in paediatric. In order to better understand which conditions may be actionable in childhood, we approached the question from a public health perspective, applying the WHO screening criteria to determine if a conditi on was a good target for opportunistic screening in the context of genome sequencing. We applied this framework to the list of 56 genes conditions considered actionable and therefore reportable by the ACMG in the context of genomic sequencing. We concluded that assessment of actionability du ring childhood should strongly consider issues of:o penetrance of treatable manifestations (not simply of any manifestation of the condition) at 18 years,o likelihood and severity of adverse outcome with this condition,o whether a clear risk reduction intervention with proven (not simply anec dotal) benefits is available. For incompletely penetrant conditions, the likelihood to have a deleterious impact on the patient if we wait for them to display clinical symptoms to establish a diagnosis should also be considered.",2016
26876,"Introduction: Genomic testing is placing unprecedented pressure on the concept of autonomy. Traditionally a paramount principle in genetic testing, autonomy is now at risk of being trumped by other considerations, such as what may be in an individualÃ¢ÂÂs or populationÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂbest interestsÃ¢ÂÂ; or the on going normalisation and integration of genomic information in health care. Materials and Methods: This paper will use methods of theoretical bioethics (applied ethics). That is, the paper will proceed by way of analysing key con cepts and case studies to build a normative ethical position on the role that considerations of autonomy should play in genomics. Results: The paper will commence with an analysis of autonomy and how it has traditionally been employed in clinical genetics and associated discipli nes. Then, using case studies, an apparent move away from presumptions of autonomy will be described. This emergent status will then be critiqued, to build an argument that autonomy should remain at the heart of geno mic decision making. However, it will also be recognised that the concept of autonomy may need refinement; in particular to account for the potential ubiquity and ongoing shared nature of genomic information. The goal is to resolve tensions between individual and collectivist approaches to informa tion provision and decision making. Conclusions: The paper will conclude by claiming that autonomy is not an obsolete concept and that it has signi ficant relevance for genomic medicine. This will mean that emerging practi ces, such as an inability to opt out of receiving genomic information, may not always be ethically defensible.

26877,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are identifying causative mutations in individuals who would have previously remained undiagnosed, influencing their treatment and providing important information to their families. However, they also have the potential to identify additional geno mic information that is unrelated to their illness, such as variants in genes with unknown function (VUS) and mutations in genes causing phenotypes extraneous to the clinical question (incidental findings, or IFs). Recommen dations by professional bodies outlining which findings should be reported by laboratories to the clinician requesting the test are inconsistent. Little is known about which variants laboratories are reporting and how they are using guidelines to make decisions about this. To address these questions, in depth interviews were conducted with labo ratory staff in Europe, Canada and Australia to explore reporting practices for diagnostic NGS. Reporting of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) dif fered between laboratories depending on the perception of its relevance to the clinical question. There was considerable variation in the filtering stra tegies that participants described. While some laboratories use quite strin gent filtering in order to limit the number of IFs that are identified, others are less strict, allowing identification of these variants. Whether these IFs are then reported to the clinician often involves detailed discussions, invol vement of multidisciplinary committees, and consideration of factors such as actionability. Our study highlights that laboratories are still grappling with decisions about which variants to report from NGS. These findings will assist laborato ries to learn from each otherÃ¢ÂÂs experiences and refine reporting guidelines.",2016

PGS results inclu ded an autosomal dominant condition neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) not previously clinically identified; carrier status for recessive condition(s); a number of variants identified as likely pathogenic but many of uncertain significance; and pharmacogenetically relevant mutations. Analysis has identified common themes between the groups: The impor tance of the pre testing counselling session with positive experiences with clinical geneticists/genetic counsellors. Barriers to uptake: including skepti cism of family members, medical practitioners, genetics colleagues, and pri vacy concerns. Genetics professionals cited rationale for testing as profes sional interest and/or curiosity, without anticipating personal or family im pact; non genetics professionals reported personal interest, curiosity, and interest in being an early adopter. On reflection, despite this initial objective motivation, several found the impact of the test results had unanticipated personal impact and changed over time and later recognized their relevan ce, as health problems developed or family history was interrogated more closely. Disclosure of results has been limited. Participants felt that expecta tions; residual risk; changes in interpretation with developing phenotypes; and personal and family impact and communication needed greater empha sis at the pre test session. Some non genetics professionals felt information provided in the report was too complex.

There were diverse perceptions of the relative influence of genetics and environment on health, mental health, behaviour, talent or personality. While many participants felt their own understanding of genetics was limited and did not mention specific terms, such as epigene tics, they were able to contribute to discussions using descriptive language.

This leads to suboptimal referral for genetic counselling and can have negative health consequences for both patients and family members.

Materials and me thods: Through an online focus group we investigated the attitudes of 3 GEs and 5 surgeons in training towards cancer family history collecting, discus sing genetic testing and their needs regarding an e learning intervention. Subsequently, the results were discussed with a GE, surgeon, clinical gene ticist, medical psychologist, an educational and an information technology expert to develop a framework. Results: GEs and surgeons in training are positive towards collecting a family history. However, they lack experience and oncogenetic knowledge and perceive this as more important than lack of communication skills. Furthermore, they perceive time pressure as well as difficulties in managing patientÃ¢ÂÂs reactions. Also, they lack knowledge on useful information sources (e.g. guidelines). These clinicians appreciate an e learning, but want it to be short and case based. Conclusions: The focus group has shown that the e learning should be short, case based and focus on knowledge instead of communication skills. Currently, the e learning is tested among a group of surgeons and GEs (n,50). The e learning and its evaluation will be presented during the conference.

Furthermore, we investigated by question naire among carrier parents over age 40 (n , 248) needs and challenges in communication to offspring. Qualitative interviews were done among 10 carriers. Results: The test uptake was 75% in FMA and 39% in DCA. One reason for DCA higher failing may be the contact letter, being too considerate and thus vague. In family communication, informing the children about their risk was experienced most difficult, and 30% of parents reported a wish for profes sional help.

This will be studied by measuring to what extent message framing and adding narrative information can influence peopleÃ¢ÂÂs intention. Materials and Methods: Data was collected by means of online question naires among 504 potential users. Factors were based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and previous research about decision making. Message framing was manipulated by explaining the risk of carriership in different ways, while for narrative information half of the participants received addi tional narrative information next to factual information. Results: Factors related to more intention are: more perceived benefits about testing, experience the choice to participate as easy, non religiosity, more perceived susceptibility of carriership, more knowledge about pre conception screening and being female. Message framing and narrative in formation have no significant effect on intention to participate, perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. Conclusions: This research clarifies which factors are most related to deci sion making. Also that message framing and the addition of narrative infor mation can inform the general public about preconception carrier screening but will not influence their participation. As perceived benefits of testing are most related to participation, future research should try to understand how people could be made more aware of these benefits.",2016

Methods: Companies advertising in the UK were identified through web searches. Accessible T&C and privacy policies, including data re use, were assessed against HGC benchmarks. Sentiments evoked by the marketing messages were examined through social media consultation. Results: After excluding genealogy and paternity services, 14 companies remained, of which 10 were registered in the UK and subject to UK Data Protection laws.

Cancer risk assessment is initially based on pedigree information. In Iceland, cancer genetic counselling is undertaken by constructing mega pedigrees using information from a large genealogy database and the population based Icelandic Cancer Registry. This enables rapid identification of coun sellees that belong to families with a known BRCA variation. Since January 2007, over 1900 individuals with concerns about familial breast and ovarian cancer have been seen. Until recently, only two BRCA founder variations were known in the Ice landic population i.e. the BRCA2:c.771_775del5 with carrier frequency 0.6 0.8% and the BRCA1:5193G >A, with unknown but low frequency. Through the cancer genetic service, three other BRCA1 and one BRCA2 pathogenic variations have been found in six families. Up to eight pedigrees are made for counsellees: those of the father and mo ther of each grandparent and their descendants. This method enables ac curate tracing of any mutation. A mega family is defined as a pedigree not sharing carrier individuals with another family. Pedigree size (mega family) can vary from 50 4400 individuals (average 379). Up to the end of Decem ber 2015, 455 families have been traced. Sixty two families with BRCA2 c.771_775del5 variation and four with BRCA1:5193G >A variation. In all, 1400 counselees have been tested for an alteration in a BRCA gene. Of 755 individuals tested for BRCA2:c.771_775del5, 339 had a positive result, while of 58 tested for BRCA1:5193G >A , 27 were positive. Families have a positive attitude about the use of mega pedigrees. This approach may be useful in other countries where there is access to genealogical databases.",2016
26895,"Introduction: Non accidental injury (NAI, or abuse) is a worldwide pediatric concern. The prevalence of NAI with fractures is 2.4/1,000 in the 0 3 year rage. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which is characterized by fragile bo nes, is the most common genetic condition confused with NAI (prevalence 0.1/1000). Genetic testing can be used to help distinguish OI from NAI. Materials and Methods: To understand how genetic test results for OI are used by professionals involved in child protection, one on one semi struc tured telephone interviews were conducted with 5 child welfare workers and 5 child abuse lawyers (dependency side) that were known to have some experience or involvement with this issue. Interviews were recorded, tran scribed, and coded by two separate coders. Results: Interview results revealed that these professionals are not typically trained about causes of skeletal injury besides NAI, and that testing might be limited by financial, policy, or guidelines limitations. When genetic testing is done, results are sometimes misunderstood and thus misrepresented in court in the hands of professionals untrained in genetic analysis. Discussion: While genetic testing can identify children with OI among those investigated for NAI, testing could also come at some risk. Misunderstanding of genetic test results in the hands of a non geneticist professional could result in serious ramifications for family members, and improved guidance and training may be necessary to avoid unintended adverse consequences. Further exploration of these issues will be conducted by surveying a larger population of these professionals later this year. ESY1 Symposium Diversity",2016

In these families there is little awareness of inherited disorders and research has identified that lack of knowledge, poor communication, language barriers and stigma are all factors inhibiting access. In Manchester a multidisciplinary strategy integrating clinical, educational and community engagement strands have been implemented to enhance access to genetic services. Similarly, East of England Genomic Medicine Centre have develo ped innovative approaches to tackling inequality of access to genomic medi cine in particular access to familial cancer services. AUSTRALIA: Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance (MGHA), comprising 10 organisations (hospitals, research institutes and a university), has a visi on of integrating genomics in everyday healthcare by establishing a single shared approach to genomic information across these multiple organisati ons, for the benefit of patients, clinicians and researchers. English as second language (ESL) was not a barrier for recruitment to the project, with 9% of patients having ESL and at least 18 languages spoken.

26899,"In its first 20 years the UK Huntingtons Disease Prediction Consortium identified 22 pregnancies at high-risk of Huntingtons Disease that were continued following prenatal testing. Huntingtons Disease is a severe, inherited neurodegenerative condition. Prenatal testing is available through direct or exclusion methods, but is not indicated for couples committed to completing the pregnancy if the fetus is found to be at a high-risk. This ethically complex scenario ultimately removes the childs future right to make an autonomous decision regarding predictive testing. To explore the circumstances surrounding these 22 cases the genetic centres involved were asked to review the case notes and complete a questionnaire. 14 were returned. Thematic analysis identified time pressure and external influence as two major factors contributing to the couples decision-making. The inability to predict which couples this will affect was highlighted, as were the barriers to maintaining contact and follow-up. Most commonly the couples involved were described as long-term and committed, and their decision-making confused and emotional. This study suggests genetic practitioners must fully prepare couples for the prenatal test and possible termination of pregnancy experience, including the chance of delays and of new emotions surfacing at each stage. Effective liaison with other health professionals is also essential to ensure awareness of the complexity and implications of the situation.",2016
26900,"Introduction: A review of the literature suggests a lack of research exploring autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in the field of genetic counselling. Previous studies focused on the treatment, management, pathophysiology or molecular genetics. This study focused on the affected individuals experiences with access to genetics services, genetic risk discussions within the family and desired genetic information support.Methods: A written questionnaire containing both open and closed questions was completed (n = 16). A subset of participants (n=9) completed a semi-structured interview using a pre-determined topic guide. The interview transcripts, and parts of the questionnaire were analysed thematically. Themes were identified if they were expressed by at least half the participants. Medical records were also reviewed to triangulate the data collected across three different media to add rigour.Results: Participants reported having little or no experience with genetic services. Many themes identified were unexpected, such as: (i) family history was unknown, (ii) family communication was hindered by a lack of information and knowledge about the condition and (iii) genetics support was desired. The key results were the lack of awareness about: the condition, its implications for the family and how information and guidance can be accessed from the genetics department.Conclusion: This study reflects the findings from previous studies regarding the minimal genetic service usage, misconception of genetic information and the complexities surrounding family communication. Additionally, this study has obtained new information about the type of information this population is seeking, barriers to accessing genetic services and desired support.",2016
26901,"Introduction: Palliative healthcare professionals (PHCPs) frequently do not refer their eligible patients to the All Wales Medical Genetics Service. After the death of the affected individual, clinically relevant information for family members is lost. In previous research, PHCPs stated that the end-of-life setting is not appropriate to discuss genetic issues. It is unclear if this has changed due to increasing awareness of genetics in the media and efforts to mainstream genetics.Materials and Methods: Semi-structured interviews of PHCPs were analysed by thematic analysis.Results: Seven PHCPs (four nurses, two consultants, and one clinical psychologist) were interviewed. Participants reported feeling unfamiliar with the role of clinical genetics services, and did not feel confident in addressing genetic issues with their patients. A lack of scientific knowledge and unawareness of existing infrastructure to support their patients were cited. Many stated that palliative patients are interested in exploring a potential hereditary component to their disease, and acknowledged the potential for psychological benefit for their patients and their families. Most stated that addressing genetics fits within their skill set, but expressed concern about issues of consent, logistical difficulties, and ethical dilemmas.Discussion: These perceptions differ considerably from those reported in existing literature. Importantly, each participant stated that the potential benefits of addressing genetic issues outweighed the potential for harm in most cases. These results suggest a need for clinical genetics staff to develop closer links with their local PHCPs and to provide education. Clinical psychologists may also be a helpful resource to address PHCPs concerns",2016
26902,"Introduction: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of disorders which affect the connective tissue that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The latest classification recognizes six subtypes, including the hypermobility type, which is an autosomal dominantly transmitted disorder with variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. Lifelong follow-up in a multidisciplinary team is needed since the underlying genetic defect has thus far not been identified and hence laboratory diagnosis is currently not available.Material and Methods: The hypermobility type of EDS may affect as many as 1 in 10.000 people. In 2014, the Ghent University Hospital has launched its multidisciplinary EDS clinic. The team consists of a geneticist, a genetic counsellor, physiotherapists, an occupational therapist, podiatrists, a psychologist and a social worker. After having been diagnosed by the geneticist, patients receive appointments with members of the team, according to their needs. An individual yearly follow-up scheme is offered to each patient.Results: Since the start of the clinic approximately 300 patients were recorded. Each patient has an individual file where the overall health status is maintained and that is evaluated in a monthly multidisciplinary meeting.Conclusion: The EDS hypermobility type comprises a clinically heterogeneous group of connective tissue diseases. Since there is no cure, a multidisciplinary approach is required to provide a preventive and symptomatic care. Organizing an EDS clinic where patients are seen on a regularly individual base, at one moment by several experienced specialists, is an added value in optimizing the care.",2016
26903,"Background. With the advent of new genetic technologies and the subsequent advances in genetic medicine, non-medical healthcare providers are being enlisted to assist in clinical genetics services. In Belgium, although the professional title of genetic counselor was recently accepted, no formal genetic counseling courses exist. A working group of genetic counselors was established in 2015 to provide support for this growing profession in Belgium. However, the scope of this new role remains unexplored in the Belgian context.Objectives. This study aims to systematically identify the scope of non-medical healthcare providers practices in Belgium.Methods. A survey will be administered to all non-medical healthcare providers working within the eight genetic centers in Belgium in March 2016. Questions will be based on those by Skirton et al. 2013, exploring the aspects of genetic counseling that are relevant to their current practice. We anticipate responses from all 15 non-medical healthcare providers currently working in Belgium.Results. The analysis will focus on 1) participants knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding psychosocial aspects, and medical and human genetics, 2) the ethical, legal and social issues they face, and 3) professional practice, education and research. Results will be compared to the European situation.Conclusions.

26904,"Introduction: Family history is an inexpensive tool to assess risks of multifactorial diseases. However, better knowledge is needed on how family history is related to perceived risks of such diseases. We examined how family history relates to perceived risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and depression, and whether these associations are independent of or moderated by sociodemographics, health behavior/weight status (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI [kg/m²]), or depressive symptoms.Methods: Participants were Finnish 25?74-year-olds (N=6258) from a population-based FINRISK 2007 study. Perceived absolute lifetime risks (15) and first-degree family history of CVD, diabetes, cancer and depression, and health behaviors were self-reported. Weight and height were measured in a health examination.Results: Family history was most prevalent for cancer (36.7%), least for depression (19.6%). Perceived risk mean was highest for CVD, lowest for depression. Association between family history and perceived risk was strongest for diabetes (?=0.34, P<0.001), weakest for depression (?=0.19, P<0.001). Adjusting for sociodemographics, health behavior, and depressive symptoms did not change these associations. The association between family history and perceived risk tended to be stronger among younger than among older adults, but similar regardless of health behaviors or depressive symptoms.Conclusions: Association between family history and perceived risk varies across diseases. Among those with healthy and unhealthy behavior, family history contributes equally to perceived risk. Future research should seek to identify the most effective strategies to combine familial and genetic risk communication in disease prevention.Funded by the Academy of Finland (grants 275033 and 265796)",2016
26905,"Introduction: Prophylactic oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations significantly reduces their risk of developing ovarian cancer. While in countries such as the US as many as 70% of BRCA-positive women choose to have this type of preventive surgery, anecdotal evidence suggests that frequencies in Italy are much lower. Our aim was to investigate healthy Italian womens attitudes toward ovarian cancer risk management options, and to identify predictors of the preference for surgery over intensified surveillance.Methods: Healthy women, aged 30 to 45, were asked to a) imagine they had a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation they could inherit; b) read informational material on predictive BRCA testing; c) fill out a questionnaire assessing knowledge, risk perception, preferences for cancer risk management options, and socio-demographic variables. Binary logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of the preference for surgery over intensified surveillance.Results: Surveillance was viewed very positively and was the preferred option, whereas surgery was chosen by 24% of the 181 participants. Predictors of choice were associated with: knowledge (knowing that life expectancy is longer with surgery compared to surveillance, perceived comprehension of the consequences of testing, previous knowledge about BRCA testing), risk perception (anticipatory worry about developing cancer, feelings of risk), and childbearing intentions. Except for the latter, higher levels of these predictors were associated with a higher likelihood to choose surgery.Conclusion: Our findings shed light on factors associated with greater intention to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy, providing useful insights for genetic counselling.",2016

It is therefore important to consider these factors within a specific culture when hoping to maximize the effective awareness of the appropriate individuals of this culture, regarding their genetic status. In an effort to indeed consider these factors, in our paper we will examine variables such as how the patient re sponds to a positive genetic status, how effectively this status is communica ted to the biological family, and the response of the biological family, as well as where and how misinformation may occur. We will review the data accumulated through the patients seen at the clini cal genetics clinic, with respect to their demographic data, their socioeco nomic status and diagnosis. Also we will discuss how these responses have evolved over the last twelve years since the introduction of cancer genetic counselling and testing as a service offered in Cyprus.

26907,"Background: Recent research has shown that aspirin reduces the risk of Lynch syndrome (LS)-associated cancers. Little is known about clinicians attitudes, current practice and perceived barriers to recommending aspirin as a RRM.Aim: To explore the attitudes of Australian clinicians towards using aspirin as a RRM.Methods: Clinicians were invited to complete an online survey. Topics included their LS clinical experience, views and practice of recommending aspirin as a RRM, and knowledge about clinical risk management guidelines for LS. Comparison of attitudes between the professional groups: familial cancer clinic (FCC) staff vs non-FCC staff, genetics professionals vs non genetics professionals: gastroenterologist and colorectal surgeons) was performed.Results: Data analysis is ongoing. 155 respondents: 8 medical oncologists, 7 clinical geneticists, 26 genetic counsellors, 52 colorectal surgeons, 44 gastroenterologists, 7 nurses and 11 other health professionals completed the survey. Significantly more FCC staff (85%) think that aspirin is an effective RRM, are confident about their knowledge of literature and had discussed aspirins potential role but non FCC staff (55.1%) are more likely to recommend aspirin. Similarly, non-genetics professionals (88% of gastroenterologists and 76.2% of colorectal surgeons) are more likely to recommend aspirin despite genetics professionals (78%) reporting greater confidence in knowledge about the literature.Discussion: FCCs staffs incongruent attitude between perception of aspirins efficacy and actual practice of recommending aspirin warrants further research to understand the underlying reasons. Non FCC staff and non-genetics professionals higher likelihood of recommending aspirin despite reporting lower confidence suggest possible need for training programs",2016
26908,"Introduction: Psychosocial interventions are often recommended for individuals with a personal or familial history of colorectal cancer but their impact on various outcomes has been less explored. Our objective was to investigate the impact of psychosocial interventions on cognitive (knowledge about cancer genetics, perception of risk), affective (distress, anxiety, depression) and behavioural (uptake of genetic testing, uptake of screening and surveillance) outcomes in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer or family members at risk.Material and Methods: An extensive search was conducted in electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo and Cochrane) investigating the literature published until January 2016. We included studies which investigated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for colorectal cancer; clearly defined the psychosocial interventions; included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer or family members at risk. Two authors independently assessed the quality of studies.Results: Studies included in this analysis mainly explored Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and other familial colorectal cancers without an established genetic factor. The interventions investigated in the studies that met our inclusion criteria are genetic counselling, educational sessions and psychological interventions. Our review shows that psychosocial interventions are efficient in terms of several cognitive, affective and behavioural outcomes.Conclusions: A number of psychosocial interventions are aimed at improving affective, cognitive and behavioural outcomes in indiviuals affected or at risk for familial colorectal cancer and the vast majority of them are efficient.

26909,"Introduction: The Psychosocial Aspects of Hereditary Cancer (PAHC) questionnaire has been recently developed in the Netherlands to assess psychosocial issues associated with cancer genetic counselling (CGC) in counselees. The PAHC includes 27 items organized into six problem domains (genetics, practical issues, family, living with cancer, emotions, and children), and has proven to be useful in improving counsellor- counselee communication and decreasing counselee distress. We aimed at developing an Italian adaptation of the PAHC (I-PAHC), as no such questionnaire is currently available in Italy.Methods: This is a prospective multicentre observational study including three stages: (i) development of the I-PAHC; (ii) pilot study aimed at testing item readability; (iii) validation study.Results: We present here the results of stages (i) and (ii). During the translation process the research team decided to add two further domains (perceived social support and motivation to undergo genetic testing), and expanded the emotions domain to include positive emotions. The I-PAHC thus comprises 49 items. Thirty participants were administered the I-PAHC and interviewed to investigate item readability. While most of the items were found to be easy to understand and to score, some required revision to improve comprehensibility, and others were deleted as irrelevant or redundant.Conclusions: The I-PAHC seems likely to afford comprehensive content coverage of psychosocial problems related to cancer genetic counselling, and study participants have thus far reacted positively to the instrument. The next step of the project will be to test the psychometric properties of the questionnaire in a larger sample.",2016

26911,"Introduction: Ivacaftor (Kalydeco), a CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene potentiator, is a treatment approved for CF patients with at least one p. Gly551Asp CFTR-mutation. It is clinically effective in short-term clinical trials and small real-world settings in CF patients. Ivacaftors apparent potential to change clinical outcomes highlights the need for research exploring the psychosocial impact of ivacaftor for patients and implications for their care. This service evaluation explored the experiences of a group of patients on ivacaftor within two UK adult CF centres using qualitative methods.Methods: Participants were recruited from the All Wales Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre and the Bristol Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre. Seven adult CF patients participated in semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.Results: Participants reported significant improvements in respiratory symptoms and a decrease in their CF treatment regimes since taking ivacaftor. All were tentatively contemplating growing older and new life choices including having children and pursuing a career. Some were experiencing anxiety about the treatments side-effect of weight gain and reported dissatisfaction with their body image since taking ivacaftor. Ivacaftor experiences were novel for the adult with CF: patient narratives emerged of negotiation of care between the patient and service provider.Conclusion: The changing perceptions of these patients towards their future health and ageing with CF has potential implications for how CF centres and other NHS services personalise care for this emerging cohort who are considering new challenges such as weight gain, decisions about future careers and having children.",2016
26912,"Advances in genetics and genomics provide new and powerful ways for individuals to understand their past and predict their futures. These technologies are now available in the marketplace and are heavily and directly promoted to consumers. Although some may see this as an inevitable and valuable democratization and dissemination of biomedical knowledge, it is not unproblematic. Importantly, there is often a discrepancy between consumer expectations of what personal genome tests may provide and the explanatory power that they find they have.In this paper, I present findings from a mixed methods research project that explored Australian consumers beliefs, knowledge, expectations and experiences of direct-to-consumer personal genome testing (DTCPGT). This research involved a public survey, in-depth qualitative interviews with consumers of DTCPGT and an autoethnography.The results of this research reveal that while DTCPGT may have value, both for consumers and for society, this is contextually dependent. Importantly, seeking DTCPGT appears to be best understood as a process of securitization. That is, an individual will seek genetic knowledge about their self through DTCPGT because they believe it will enable them to confirm certainties about their life and to decrease uncertainties. Unfortunately, the reality is that DTCPGT instead often leads to the proliferation of uncertainty. This is because the scientific knowledge is still limited. We also lack knowledge as to what psycho-social impact test results may have. Further, gaining any form of information unavoidably reveals the gaps in that knowledge.",2016
26913,"Introduction: Many decisions that healthcare professionals and researchers working in cancer genetics (HPRCGs) make in their daily practice have a moral dimension, and it is not uncommon for HPRCGs to be faced with situations involving difficult value judgements. Drawing from the experience of the UK Genethics Club, the Forum OncoGenEtica was established in 2014 to provide Italian HPCGs with opportunities to discuss the practical ethical problems that arise in their work.Materials and Methods: The Forum OncoGenEtica meets twice yearly and is open to healthcare professionals and researchers working in cancer genetics or otherwise involved with families affected by hereditary cancer. Participants are encouraged to present ethically problematic cases. Meetings are informal and discussion is facilitated by a bioethicist, a molecular geneticist, an oncologist and a clinical geneticist. After each meeting a report is circulated among participants summarizing the cases and the salient points of the discussion.Results: As of January 2016 the Forum has organized three meetings and a conference at the San Martino-IST Research Hospital in Genoa, Italy. Overall attendance has exceeded 200 participants, mostly from hospitals or universities in northern Italy. Eighteen cases have been discussed, with balancing conflicting interests and managing confidentiality within families being the most frequent topics.Conclusions: The Forum OncoGenEtica has thus far met with a good degree of interest within the Italian cancer genetics community.

26914,"Objective: To develop a generic scale for assessing attitudes towards cancer genetic testing (BRCA1/2) and test this scale psychometrically among a sample of French General Practitioners and Breast Specialists.Methods: A 15 items scale was drawn up in a context of an international project (INCRISC European project), assessing perceived benefits (8 items) and drawbacks (6 items) of the process of breast/ovarian cancer genetic testing (BRCA1/2) as well as an overall indicator of agreement with the fact that expected health benefits of BRCA1/2 testing exceeded negative consequences and justified their medical prescription. These items were included in a self-administered questionnaire mailed to a sample of French doctors: 182 Breast Surgeons (BS), 275 General Practitioners (GPs) and 294 gynaeco-obstetricians. Principal Component Analysis, Cronbachs ? coefficient, and Pearsons correlations were used in the statistical analyses.Results: 4 dimensions emerged from the respondents responses, and were classified under the headings: Discrimination-Stigmatisation, Risk Information, Prevention-Surveillance, and Anxiety-Conflicts. Cronbachs ? coefficients on the four dimensions were 0.82, 0.76, 0.62 and 0.57 respectively, and each dimension demonstrated a good correlation with the overall indicator of agreement (criterion validity). Breast surgeons scored lower on the first and fourth dimensions (both negative dimensions) and higher on the third dimension (Prevention-Surveillance). Women doctors scored higher on the fourth dimension.Conclusions: The validation process revealed satisfactory psychometric properties for this scale that could be generic for cancer genetic testing.

26915,"Introduction: Predictive testing of any kind is of utmost importance for public health. In light of the cost reductions in sequencing technologies, predictive genetic and genomic testing is bound to become an integral part of personalized healthcare as well as public health approaches. Consequently, models that integrate gene and environment interactions are needed to be developed for common complex diseases, as both play a role in disease etiology. This work focuses on a public health genomics model with the aim of improving it via expert evaluation and validation prior to implementation.Materials and Methods: We have previously published a public health genomics model for common complex diseases that integrates genetic testing and environmental factors for prevention of disease onset. In this study, we utilize the widely-used Delphi technique to improve and validate this particular model, and to facilitate discussion on setting associated ethical guidelines. The Delphi technique involves rounds of structured discussions of the model by an expert panel with the aim of building consensus.Results: The expert-improved and validated model for predictive genetic testing in common complex diseases will provide a basis for development and standardization of associated healthcare guidelines and policies. In parallel, this study will provide a platform for discussion and formulation of ethical guidelines and regulations for implementation of the model.Conclusions: The improved, validated model will present a valuable source for development of effective public health implementations and ethical guidelines for predictive testing of common complex diseases including cancers, cardiovascular conditions, diabetes and psychiatric conditions.",2016
26916," Introduction: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are among the most inheritable neurodevelopmental disorders, but the aetiology remains unknown in the majority of cases. Therefore, most parents must base their reproductive decisions on empiric recurrence risk (RR) estimates. To determine factors influencing family planning and benefits of genetic counselling (GC), we studied knowledge and perceptions in parents with children with idiopathic ASD.Materials and Methods: Parents with at least one child with ASD (n=39) answered a basal questionnaire addressing different topics, such as knowledge, perceived causes and RR or attitude towards genetics. A subset whose child had obtained negative results in molecular karyotype and exome sequencing (n=15) received GC and a following-up questionnaire afterwards and fifteen days later.Results: Although most parents had received information about ASD, few had seen a medical geneticist or a genetic counsellor. Genetics was the most frequent perceived cause, especially among those with affected relatives. RR was overestimated by most parents and qualitative and quantitative estimates correlated. About half of parents believed that RR affected their family planning and their risk perception was higher compared to those who did not. After GC, quantitative but not qualitative RR estimates lowered and knowledge and favorable opinion towards genetics increased.Conclusions: Although most parents perceived genetic factors as the most common cause of ASD, few had visited a genetics service. Perception of RR affects family planning and is overestimated by most parents. GC can improve knowledge and RR estimates and is key to take informed choices.Grant support: FI-DGR/2013.",2016
26917,"Introduction: We are undertaking a prospective, mixed-method study of the psychological and behavioural impact of disclosing genomic testing results for common risk variants associated with breast cancer. An education pamphlet for women considering testing for common risk variants to assess their breast cancer risk was developed and pilot tested. Participants of an existing study: Common Genetic Variants and Familial Cancer were invited to take part in this study.Methods: The two-page education pamphlet provides a brief explanation of rare high-risk gene mutations (BRCA1 and BRCA2) and common risk variants in breast cancer. It covers a range of topics relevant to genomic testing for breast cancer risk, including meaning and implications of results, impact on family members and insurance. The pamphlet was written in accordance with health literacy guidelines and at a grade nine literacy standard (14-15 years old). The pamphlet was pilot-tested with 28 female participants of the parent study. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all responses.Results: All women thought their understanding of the risks and benefits of genetic testing had improved. The majority of participants (68%) reported that the education pamphlet did not make them feel worried, with 71% actually reporting feeling reassured. Participants provided detailed suggestions for amendments including visual presentation, and readability. Feedback provided has since been incorporated and the final pamphlet has been reduced to a grade 8 literacy level (12-14 years old).Conclusions: The revised pamphlet with the information on genomic testing and breast cancer risk will be used in the prospective psychosocial study",2016
26918,"Introduction: Much research has been conducted on the outcome of couplesdecision-making, when a genetic disorder runs in the family. However, the question of how couples come to decisions, or what information they need to reach an informed choice, has seldom been the subject of research.Materials and Methods: During many years of working with couples, materials have been collected for a new booklet on strategies and supportive action plans for the decision-making process.Results: A new booklet entitled The desire for children and inherited genetic conditions (in Dutch: Kinderwens en erfelijkheid) has emerged from the practice based evidence of supporting couples struggling with reaching decisions whether or how to have children, when one or both parents has a hereditary disease. This booklet describes not only the various reproductive options available to such couples but also various strategies to facilitate their decision making. The booklet also contains tools to assist when the decisionmaking process threatens to get stuck. One of these tools will be presented on the poster.Conclusions: Written information should not and cannot replace tailored counseling. However, by describing various strategies of decision-making in the field of genetics, written information can be important for both counselees, social workers and genetic counselors. This is particularly so when the genetic counselling entails delicate decisions.",2016
26919,"Introduction: The process of communicating information about Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD or BMD) to girls who may be carriers has been little studied. Mothers are often the primary source of information, both about carrier risk and the nature of the condition, yet mothers voices are notably absent in the literature. We need to understand how mothers experience this communication process in order to best support them in this task.Materials and Methods: A qualitative study using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) explored how mothers described and reflected on the experience of communicating information about DMD or BMD and carrier risk to their daughters aged <18 years. 6/15 mothers invited to participate through the North West Family Register Service agreed to participate. Semi-structured telephone interviews of around 45 minutes were audiotaped with consent, and transcribed in full for IPA analysis.Results: The six participants described how they had endeavoured to be open and honest with their daughters. Yet, all had struggled with some aspect of the communication process. Notably mothers found it harder to talk about the future, both in terms of the life limiting nature of the condition and their daughters future reproductive options. We describe the different phases of disclosure reached, and the barriers and facilitators of communication identified.Conclusions: Participants suggested interventions that they felt would aid the disclosure process, notably a greater involvement of Genetic Counsellors at an earlier stage.",2016
26920,"Introduction: Research genomic screening is increasingly used to identify genetic causes of disease, including cancer. However, there is evidence that individuals who are notified of clinically actionable research findings are illequipped to make decisions regarding uptake of these findings. While effective decision support for these research participants is clearly required, the broad scope of genomic screening presents unique challenges in resource development. We aimed to develop a resource to fill this decision support gap.Methods: A decision aid booklet was developed based on a systematic review of the literature regarding cancer genetic counselling uptake, the International Patient Decision Aid Standards and the expertise of a steering committee of clinicians, researchers and consumers. The acceptability of the decision aid was assessed by questionnaire among genetic research participants who had previously accessed clinically actionable research findings.Results: All 19 participants stated that the decision aid was easy to read and clearly presented, increased their understanding of the implications of taking up research findings and would be helpful in their decision-making. Seven participants reported low to moderate levels of distress/worry after reading the booklet; however 18 reported some level of reassurance. All participants would recommend the booklet to others considering uptake of clinically actionable research findings.Conclusions: Results indicate the decision aid is acceptable to the target audience and has potential as a useful decision support tool for genomic research participants. The decision aid will be provided to Australian research participants notified of clinically actionable research findings by the International Sarcoma Kindred Study.",2016
26921,"Introduction: UK guidelines advise genetics professionals to support and encourage family communication about genetic risk. We sought to explore genetics professionals experiences in clinical practice and to identify effective elements of communication in this area.Methods: In depth interviews with 23 genetics professionals across Scotland, UK.Results: Whilst all participants felt that facilitating family communication about genetics was an important aspect of their role, one third reported giving limited advice and lacked confidence in this area, particularly parent/child communication. Nevertheless, we identified several successful strategies and frameworks which genetics professionals draw upon, including: (1) Initiating a discussion about how/when to tell; (2) Offering to tell children directly (with or without parent present); (3) Offering access to a quick follow-up appointment e.g. after parental disclosure and (4) Accepting ambiguity as there maybe no clear cut answers. In cases of nondisclosure professionals may: (1) Chip away (over months or years); (2) Undertake emotion work before involve children or (3) Use other relatives as different routes to disclosure e.g. siblings or aunts/uncles. Participants expressed a need for child/young people focussed counselling aids, including disease specific disclosure guidance, and the time to undertake this work.Conclusion: Genetics professionals use multiple strategies to facilitate family communication about genetics, particularly psychoeducational guidance to parents. However, this remains a challenging and sensitive area in which genetics professionals express a need for further training, resources and evidence based interventions.KFK was funded by a CSO Fellowship, Scottish Government and the NHS Grampian Huntingtons disease Research Endowments Fund.",2016
26922,"Introduction: Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss (NSHL) has always created a growing interest due to its genetic heterogeneity and complex social background. We present the first Spanish study that gathers together genetic and social complexities of NSHL, highlighting the importance of genetic counseling. The aims of the study were to evaluate differences in opinions, knowledge and information needs or genetic counseling among the deaf individuals and their families. Knowledge and satisfaction of those who had received genetic counseling were also analyzed.Methods: Participants (n=50) were recruited from different centres and associations from Catalonia (Spain). An ethically validated questionnaire was distributed to the families; data was statistically analyzed with SPSS (v.20)Results: Differences in terms of knowledge, interest in diagnostic test and opinions, defined by the level of immersion in the deaf community and hearing status of partners and relatives were found. Most of the participants (62%) were interested in genetic testing. Feelings towards genetic testing were mostly positive in comparison with previous studies in other populations. We also have seen that testing may not influence significantly on reproductive options although 33% would opt for a reproductive alternative (being PD the first option, 61%). A great increase of knowledge was evidenced between the pre- and post counseling session (37% of correct answers to 71%). The genetic counseling satisfaction score was 28.18 (out of 30).Conclusions: This work reveals an evident need of information about genetics of hearing loss and shows a great increase of knowledge and satisfaction after receiving genetic counseling.",2016
26923,"Introduction: As genetic testing of cancer patients increasingly will be part of the diagnostic process, due to treatment consequences, it is important to ensure that the patients receive accurate genetic information within the clinical setting. New methods to provide patients with genetic information and counseling in the decision process are needed. Through the DNA-BONus study unselected breast-and ovarian cancer patients were offered BRCA1/2 testing and familial cancer risk assessment without prior genetic counseling. We developed and evaluated a web based patient oriented information site, and measured the efficacy of an online decisional aid in genetic testing.Material and methods: From April 2014 to April 2015, eligible patients were consecutively randomized into two groups, intervention group (N= 85) and control group (N= 109). They all received the same information prior to genetic testing, but the intervention group was also provided with a patient oriented web site (log in required) about hereditary breast- and ovarian cancer. The web site was built up using the Interactive Health Communication System model (ICHS). ICHS ensures quality assured information and increases the patients feeling of control and contributes to involve partner in the decisional process.Different psycho-social measures have been included in the DNA-BONus study. In the present RCT we included two outcome questionnaires; Openness to discuss cancer in the nuclear family and Decisional Conflict Scale. Conclusion: Updated results will be presented, including the use and evaluation of the web site, and the efficacy of the online decisional aid.",2016
26924,"INTRODUCTION: Risks to develop breast cancer in women carrying mutations in BRCA1/2 range between 55 and 86%.Prophylactic mastectomy (PM) is one of the actions raised by patients to reduce the risk significantly. Until recently, population opted for a clinical follow-up and discarded to use this technique. The mixture of different circumstances, including Angelina Jolie public declaration in February 2013, have produced a notable increase for this type of surgery demand, in both - healthy and breast cancer affected women. METHODOLOGY: In total, 1020 women carriers of mutation have been analyzed and visited in the 3 genetic counselling units of Institut Català dOncologia during 1998-2006 (618 breast/ovarian or breast and ovarian cancer affected women and 402 healthy women).RESULTS: Until 2013, 707 patients were visited. Among the 235 healthy ones, only 4.6% performed the PM, while among the 472 carriers affected, 14.7% opted for the PM surgery.Heretofore, the total number of carriers has risen to 1020. Overall, 10.94% of the healthy patients and 18.9% of the affected ones have chosen the PM.In percentage terms in 2013-2016 period, PM have doubled compared the over previous 14 years.CONCLUSION: The so call Angelina Jolies Effect has influenced on the decisions of our patients: a considerable increase of PM among healthy patients has been noticed while it has remained quite stable among the affected ones.",2016
26925,"Background: Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) are a highly genetically heterogeneous disease group causing progressive vision loss. Diagnostic testing for IRD involves Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of a 176 IRD gene panel. NGS only identifies pathogenic variants in IRD genes in 50% of cases. Many patients remain undiagnosed. For a fraction of the patients, NGS testing produces incidental findings (IF), including variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and carrier status results. This three-armed study aimed to define the impact NGS panel testing has on patients.Materials and Methods: Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews investigated patient views of NGS panel testing and the impact of results. 23 participants were recruited from the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine. 5 participants received a pathogenic, positive result, 11 received an inconclusive, negative result and 7 received an IF result. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).Results: Collectively, 5 key themes were identified: The Retinal Dystrophy Journey; Information from Health Care Services; Shared Impact; Uncertain Future; Disease-Specific Impact of NGS Testing.Conclusion: Participants receiving positive or IF results value the information and have a good understanding of possible implications. Disclosure of IF had no adverse implications in this patient cohort. In contrast, participants with negative or inconclusive results were left disappointed by genetic testing. The importance of consent, the value of full discussion around results, even if uncertain, is highlighted. Clinicians need to be aware of the challenges any NGS testing results can bring and offer continual support throughout follow-up",2016
26926,"Providing risk information is central to genetic counselling. Many studies have examined risk communication, but the focus has been on professional and patient perspectives. Less information is available on risk communication in interactions. This study aimed to examine genetic counsellors (GCs) risk communication in multicultural genetic counselling sessions with women of advanced maternal age (AMA).Six GCs (2 to 20 years experience) conducted 17 AMA sessions in English (womens second language). The sessions were video and voice recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using conversation analysis women and the GCs agendas related to the implications of the risks. This mismatch can result in missed opportunities in exploring patients emotions, decisions and the implications of their choices.(CA). CA examines discourse as a topic, i.e. describing the turns, its functions and how these functions are accomplished.Analysis revealed that the GCs presented the risk of having a baby with a chromosome abnormality and the risk of spontaneous abortion due to the procedure in a number of ways. They presented the risks as odds, percentages, positives, negatives and used analogies. Examination drawing on CA principles revealed that both counsellors and women orientated to an interpretation of the risk. The womens focus was on the meaning for her baby while the GCs focus was on numerical understanding.The research showed the power of CA methodology to gain new insights into old problems.

26927,"Introduction: Prenatal testing for Down syndrome has become a routine part of prenatal care in many countries. Unfortunately, many expectant families find it difficult to make well-informed decisions about positive tests results because they receive limited information about life with Down syndrome or the information they receive is outdated and inaccurate. The main purpose of this study was to examine family functioning in families of individuals with Down syndrome from Brazil, Ireland, Korea, Portugal, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom and USA.Materials and Methods: 1358 parents completed a survey designed to assess family functioning and key dimensions of the Resiliency Model of Stress, Adjustment and Adaptation.Results: Mean family functioning for the overall sample, as well for 6 of the 8 countries fell within the average range for family functioning. It fell within the increasing strengths range for the USA and the increasing problems range for Thailand. Family functioning got worse with increasing childs age. Family functioning was significantly better with greater ability, hardiness, mutuality when partnered, and affirmative communication and significantly worse with greater strains and incendiary communication. Over 46% of the parents viewed the fact that their child had Down syndrome as a blessing in disguise.Conclusions: Findings contribute to our understanding of family functioning in families of individuals with Down syndrome, as well how culture and family factors interact and shape how families respond.",2016
26928,"Introduction: In Norway most boys with hemophilia start with prophylactic treatment around 18-24 months of age. Health professionals administer treatment initially, and parents usually provide treatment from when the child is around four years. Caring for a child with hemophilia may be demanding and stressful. Qualitative research on how parents, and especially carrier mothers, experience the treatment of their sons with hemophilia is limited. The aim of the study is to offer qualitative insights about mothers experiences about treating hemophilia in different settings.Materials and Methods: We have conducted a qualitative study to explore womens experiences of being a carrier of hemophilia and mother to a boy with hemophilia. We collected data through in-depth interviews with 16 women who were carriers and mothers of a child with hemophilia. We analyzed the data using an inductive thematic analytical approach.Results: The mothers were grateful for the availability of treatment. Hospital treatment was perceived as challenging from a practical perspective. Home treatment was preferred when the boys grew older, but mothers experienced both practical and emotional challenges related to administration of treatment. Repeated venipuncture was especially difficult. The lack of competence about hemophilia displayed by health professionals was frustrating and stressful.Conclusion: More in-depth knowledge of the experiences of mothers of boys with hemophilia, especially regarding treatment, could help health professionals better understand parents and childrens situation, and may facilitate tailored management and support.",2016
26929,"Introduction: It is estimated that 1.4% of the Brazilian population has some degree of intellectual disability. Families with a member with intellectual disability are subject to additional stressors that can affect their quality of life. This study aimed to examine family quality of life among Brazilian mothers with children who have intellectual disability. Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 mothers, selected by convenience. The interviews were then transcript, encoded and analyzed using categorical thematic analysis technique, considering nine precategories: family health, financial well-being, family relationships, support from others people, support from services, family values, career, recreation, and community interaction. Themes were examined in order to give a comprehensive and interpretative approach to the results.Results: The interviews revealed that the care of disabled child is centered on the mother, who usually stops her professional career or studies, changing the family relationships. The religious coping appeared as a common strategy adjustment and many mothers believed having a disabled child as part of ones destination. The disabled children had less access to services and support than they needed in health, education and recreation. Family quality of life was also negatively affected by financial restrictions and difficulties in social interactions.Conclusions: Emotional and psychological support for all family members, as well as social and practical support comprising income distribution and access to appropriate care, proved to be essential for the welfare of the disabled person and his family.This survey was supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP, grant 13/24498-8).",2016
26930,"The aim in this study was to explore views of genetics clinicians in Wales about usefulness and feasibility of using patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) data for continuous quality improvement in genetic counselling. PROMs data were collected using mailed self-completion questionnaires between February-July 2015. PROMs used were Genetic Counselling Outcome Scale (GCOS-24) and the generic Euroqol (EQ-5D) before and after clinic attendance, and a post-clinic audit tool. EQ-5D is the generic PROM preferred by the UK National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence, the national agency charged with promoting clinical excellence in the UK National Health Service (NHS). Qualitative interviews with eight participating clinicians explored their perceptions following monthly team meetings to monitor progress.Paired before-after PROMs data were collected from 96 patients (response rate: 23% pre-clinic, 45% post-clinic). Quantitative data analysis demonstrated statistically significant improvement in patients GCOS-24 scores after clinic attendance (p>.001), and high post-clinic scores on the audit tool but no significant change in EQ-5D scores. Monthly meetings with clinicians increasingly focused on change scores on individual GCOS-24 items and strategies the clinical team could adopt to improve these change scores over time. Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts demonstrated that participating clinicians valued use of PROMs data to inform continuous quality improvement initiatives using Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, the NHS preferred quality improvement approach. Participating clinicians considered the clinical geneticsspecific GCOS-24 the most appropriate PROM.

26931,"Despite guidelines it remains unclear when it is appropriate for a minor to have genetic testing. This study explores the experiences of women who had a carrier test for Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) as a teenager. Three research questions were investigated: what motivates women under 18 to request carrier testing? what is the impact on a young woman of having a carrier test? what do women think about the support and counselling they received?Seven women were recruited from the Manchester Family Register Service who had a carrier test for BMD as a teenager. Semi-structured, qualitative telephone interviews were carried out and themes were exposed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.The results show that the teenagers were often motivated to have a genetic test by their parents or by living and growing up with the condition, and that the majority of the participants were upset with their result but with time managed to adjust well. Some participants said that they did not fully understand the implications of their test result at the time. In general, women were satisfied with the level of genetic counselling received.",2016
26932,"Genetic testing for hereditary cancer conditions has many psychosocial impacts on, e.g., general emotional well-being, sense of identity and body image. The Guys cancer genetics service offers dedicated clinical psychology input for patients at increased familial risk, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers through the BRCA one-stop MDT clinic, risk reducing surgery pathways and BRCA support groups.Objectives: The survey investigates the psychosocial needs of patients, their satisfaction with available psychosocial support and the acceptability and utility of psychological screening tools in the BRCA one-stop MDT clinic.Methods: Over a five month period patients were asked to complete an online survey asking uptake of and satisfaction with psychosocial support received. In addition a sample of 30 patients attending the BRCA clinic were asked their views about using psycho-social screening tools including the BRCA self concept scale (Esplen et al, 2009).Results: Preliminary data shows high satisfaction with psychosocial services in the cancer genetics service. It also shows the usefulness of psychological screening tools which are tailored to those at increased familial cancer risk.Conclusion: So far the cancer genetics service has used the Distress thermometer and the BRCA Self concept scale. We are conducting a study to investigate the acceptability and usefulness of these tools in our BRCA one-stop multidisciplinary clinic. Preliminary data suggests that these tools are important for understanding which patients may be vulnerable after BRCA testing and which might require additional support.

26933,"Introduction: This qualitative study explores the experiences of parents who have a child with an undiagnosed developmental disorder; focusing particularly on reproductive decisions. The research aim was to explore the reproductive decision-making process and examine the contributing factors that influence these decisions, the reasoning behind the decisions made and the emotional consequences.Methods: Data was collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews with five mothers of children without a diagnosis. Transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.Results: Two broad themes of living without a diagnosis and the impact on reproductive decisions were identified. Participants spoke of needing a diagnosis as an explanation for their childs condition; without which they struggled with the uncertainty of their childs future. Perceptions of risk, the potential impact a child would have on their current children, expectations of a family and the desire for another child, were factors that impacted reproductive decisions.Conclusions: Reproductive decision making for parents of a child without diagnosis is a complex and emotional task that involves weighing up both practical and emotional factors. A lack of control was an overarching issue expressed by participants, who felt that they had no control over diagnosis and an unknown future ahead. This lack of control extended to the reproductive decisions of some participants, who felt the decision had been removed from them, leaving them unable to fulfil their desires to have another child. Other participants found alternative mechanisms to manage this issue, in order to regain some sense of control or relinquish control fully",2016
26934,"Though carrier testing of adolescent females for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) remains an area for discussion due to ethical questions over autonomy, it is still widely practiced. The gap that exists between guidelines - some of which are arguably outdated - and practice is something that requires addressing. Through the use of purposive, semi-structured interviews, this study endeavoured to investigate what had motivated a group of women to seek carrier testing under the age of 18, and the subsequent impact of test results. Data was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.Although parents were reported as having had an integral role throughout the testing process, all participants believed they had been in control of the decision to have carrier testing. Women stated that they had felt they had needed to know their carrier status during adolescence, largely as a means to alleviate uncertainty. There was on the whole a minimal negative reaction to testing. Although reproductive factors were framed as having been a key motivator prior to testing, test results appear to have had little impact on subsequent reproductive decisions. This discrepancy creates a pregnancy paradox. A number of women reported having not had the opportunity for genetic counselling, and having received little psychosocial input.This study is indicative that carrier testing for DMD during adolescence does not have a lasting negative impact, and that adolescent girls feel autonomous in their decision to undergo testing. The reported lack of prior psychosocial discussion is, however, something that would benefit from further research.",2016
26935,"Clinical genetics is a relatively new branch of medicine in which physicians can choose to specialize.The available residency programs vary among different countries but usually they consist of training in genetic clinic, rotations in diverse hospital departments and outpatient clinics and laboratory practice in cytogenetics, biochemical and molecular genetics. Nearly all of them are run by academic medical centres thus strong emphasis is put on research opportunities and education services. The number of physicians trained, still in training or even considering clinical genetics remains too low what is mostly connected to distinctiveness of specialty as well as economic reasons.As the field of clinical and laboratory genetics is developing rapidly, advancing both the field of diagnostic tools and therapeutic measures the need for clinical geneticists is constantly growing, outnumbering the resources. Thus the accessibility of genetic service might be limited in smaller facilities and availability of consultations within other departments.I have spent 3,5 year of residency sharing my time between various hospital department, training in genetic clinic and laboratory practice on regular basis. This balanced system has given me an enormous opportunity to create and work within interdisciplinary teams, provide genetic counseling to the groups of patients that would not be reached, quicken the right diagnosis and arrange better management and care.

26936,"Introduction: Individuals affected by genetic and rare conditions have unique support and health care needs. A necessary prerequisite for providing appropriate and accessible supportive services is to understand these needs within a rapidly developing genetics health environment. This study aims to determine the information and support needs of individuals who had previously accessed the Genetics Support Network of Victoria (GSNV) and to explore their beliefs and attitudes toward the network. Taking a participatory evaluation approach, the views of stakeholders and GSNV staff members were additionally explored to uncover avenues for organisational improvement.Materials/Methods: Participants were GSNV service users who had accessed the service within the past 12-months, (genetic/rare disease community, genetic health professionals, researchers and support group leaders), representatives from key stakeholder groups and GSNV staff members (n=40). Five focus groups were conducted with participants grouped together based on the aforementioned categories. Adopting a phenomenological approach, the focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim and coded using thematic analysis to identify major themes.Results: Preliminary data will be presented revealing important themes identified across the group discussions related to participants understanding of the GNSVs role, beliefs and attitudes, unmet information and support needs and ideas for organisational growth and change.Conclusion: This research will provide important insight into the experiences of members of the genetics health community and their information/ support needs.

26937,"Introduction: preconception genetic carrier screening (PCS) is a new approach to screen couples in the general population, without priori risk and planning pregnancy, for autosomal recessive traits. A couple would be screened for many conditions via expanded screening panels at one go. This technique is currently being piloted in the Netherlands but has not been implemented in Sweden.Materials and Methods: the study explores perceptions of PCS via expanded panels among Swedish healthcare providers, with focus on ethical aspects.Eleven healthcare professionals, including clinicians, geneticists, a midwife and a genetic counselor, from academic and clinical institutions in mid-Sweden were interviewed in depth, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and content analyzed for categories and subcategories.Results: participants expressed ethical concerns regarding discrimination, medicalization, prioritization of healthcare resources and effects on reproductive freedom. Finding resources for PCS was regarded as expensive and burdensome for Swedish healthcare system. To reach informed consent with expanded panels was also seen as a challenge. Furthermore, parents might perceive a pressure to undergo testing, if PCS was implemented. Finally, participants also expressed worries that PCS would increase medicalization and strive for control of pregnancy and parenthood. However, it was also mentioned that PCS might enhance reproductive autonomy and could reduce abortion incidence, since it allows parents to opt for reproductive decisions.Conclusion: participants nurtured many ethical and non-ethical concerns regarding PCS that may affect the uptake and use. The results give insight of ethical concerns to consider, should PCS be implemented in Sweden.",2016
26938,"Research on stigma related to genetic inherited disorders, although increasing, is still scarce. Here we report accounts of stigmatisation from patients affected by familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) ATTRV30M living in Portugals northwest coast, the largest cluster worldwide.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 patients, all mutation carriers at different stages after presymptomatic testing, recruited through the patients association. Qualitative thematic analysis of the interviews was undertaken. Findings show the influence of a discrediting social context in the enactment of stigma: FAP was perceived as a source of devaluation and social distance, and permeated by beliefs of contagion in the community. The transgenerational nature of the illness was felt as a source of rejection for courtship and mating, and of devalued reproductive worth. Decisions to have children seemed to be a target of implicit negative judgment. Dealing with stigma included restraint in talking about FAP, especially outside the family, the active confrontation of others, and social withdrawal. Participants also refer a reduction in stigma over the past few decades, as medical information, potential treatments and clinical trials, are becoming more widespread. We discuss the interactional nature of stigma with individual biography, family dynamics, and societal changes.These findings may be useful to set out the social consequences of stigma towards this group, and to understand how stigma is experienced in other genetic disorders for which presymptomatic testing is available. This is of importance to genetics and other healthcare professionals in assisting individuals to effectively manage these issues",2016
